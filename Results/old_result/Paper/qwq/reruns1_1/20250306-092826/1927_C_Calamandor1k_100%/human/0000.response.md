Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have two arrays, a and b, with lengths n and m respectively, and an even number k. The task is to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to k are included among the chosen elements.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We have to select some elements from both arrays, specifically k/2 from each, and make sure that the combined selection includes every number from 1 to k. It's important to note that the elements in arrays a and b can be any integers between 1 and 10^6, but we're only interested in those that are between 1 and k, inclusive, because we need to cover all numbers from 1 to k.

So, my initial thought is to focus only on the elements in a and b that are within the range [1, k], because any elements outside this range are irrelevant to our problem. Elements greater than k don't help us in covering the range [1, k], and similarly, elements less than 1 are invalid since k starts from 2.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since we have to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array, and k is even, that means we're dividing the selection equally between the two arrays.

I need to ensure that every number from 1 to k is chosen at least once, but since we're choosing exactly k/2 from each array, and k can be up to 2*min(n,m), which is up to 400,000, performance is crucial. The constraints suggest that a straightforward approach might not be efficient enough, so I need to find a smart way to check this for each test case without exceeding time limits.

Let's consider the sets of unique elements in a and b that are within [1, k]. Let's denote:

- only_a: elements that are in a but not in b, within [1, k]

- only_b: elements that are in b but not in a, within [1, k]

- both: elements that are in both a and b, within [1, k]

Now, to cover all numbers from 1 to k, we need to make sure that the combination of chosen elements from a and b includes all numbers from 1 to k.

Given that we have to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array, we need to see if it's possible to select k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b such that their union covers [1, k].

Let's think about the minimal requirements:

1. The total number of unique elements from 1 to k in both arrays should be at least k. If there are fewer unique elements in the combined sets from a and b within [1, k], it's impossible to cover [1, k].

2. We need to make sure that we can choose k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b such that their union is [1, k].

But checking all possible combinations is not feasible due to the size of n and m.

Let me think differently. Suppose we have some elements that are only in a, only in b, and some that are in both.

To cover [1, k], we need to make sure that for elements that are only in a, we select them from a, and for elements that are only in b, we select them from b. For elements that are in both, we can choose them from either array, but we have to make sure that we meet the required counts from each array.

Let's formalize this:

- Let’s say there are x elements that are only in a.

- There are y elements that are only in b.

- There are z elements that are in both a and b.

Then, the total unique elements from 1 to k are x + y + z.

To cover [1, k], we need x + y + z >= k.

But we also need to choose exactly k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b.

The elements chosen from a can be from only_a and both.

Similarly, elements chosen from b can be from only_b and both.

We need to make sure that all elements from 1 to k are chosen at least once.

Let’s consider the minimal number of elements we need to choose from a and b to cover all elements from 1 to k.

We need to choose all elements from only_a and all elements from only_b, because these are not present in the other array.

So, if x > k/2, it's impossible to choose enough elements from a to cover all only_a elements, because we can only choose k/2 from a.

Similarly, if y > k/2, it's impossible to choose enough elements from b to cover all only_b elements.

Additionally, we need to choose enough elements from both to cover any remaining required elements to reach k.

Wait, but it's not just about choosing all only_a and only_b elements; we also need to make sure that the total number of unique elements chosen is at least k.

Let me try to think in terms of necessary conditions:

1. If the number of elements only in a (only_a) is greater than k/2, then it's impossible to choose enough elements from a to cover all only_a elements, because we can only choose k/2 elements from a. So, in this case, the answer is NO.

2. Similarly, if the number of elements only in b (only_b) is greater than k/2, then it's impossible to choose enough elements from b to cover all only_b elements. So, again, NO.

3. If the total number of unique elements from 1 to k in both arrays is less than k, it's impossible to cover [1, k], so NO.

4. If none of the above conditions are violated, then it should be possible to choose k/2 elements from each array such that their union covers [1, k].

Wait, is that sufficient?

Let me consider an example.

Example 1:

a = [2,3,8,5,6,5], b = [1,3,4,10,5], k=6

only_a = {2,6}

only_b = {1,4}

both = {3,5}

Here, x=2, y=2, z=2

Total unique = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is equal to k=6.

We need to choose 3 elements from a and 3 from b.

From a: choose 2,3,6

From b: choose 1,4,5

Union is {1,2,3,4,5,6}, which covers [1, k].

Example 2:

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5], b = [1,3,8,10,3], k=6

only_a = {2,4,6}

only_b = {1}

both = {3,5}

Total unique = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6, which is equal to k=6.

We need to choose 3 elements from a and 3 from b.

From a: choose 2,4,6

From b: choose 1,3,5

Union is {1,2,3,4,5,6}, which covers [1, k].

Wait, but the problem says it's not possible in this case. So, perhaps there's something wrong with my approach.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the problem again.

"every integer from 1 to k is included among the chosen elements"

In the second example:

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5], b = [1,3,8,10,3], k=6

only_a = {2,4,6}

only_b = {1}

both = {3,5}

If I choose from a: 2,4,6

From b: 1,3,5

That covers 1,2,3,4,5,6. So, it seems possible.

But the problem says it's not possible. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that elements can be chosen only if they are present in the array, and perhaps in the second example, element 5 is present in both, but in b, 5 appears only once, and we might need to consider frequencies.

Wait, no, the problem says "choose exactly k/2 elements from each array", not "select k/2 distinct elements". It's about choosing k/2 elements, not necessarily distinct ones.

But in the problem statement, it's mentioned that a and b contain integers, and we need to choose elements, not necessarily distinct ones.

But in the examples, they seem to be choosing distinct elements. Maybe duplicates don't matter.

Wait, in the first example, a has two 5's, but in the selection, they chose only one 5.

Similarly, b has two 3's, but chose only one 3.

So, it seems that duplicates don't matter, and we can treat them as frequencies, but in selection, we only need to choose distinct elements.

Wait, but the problem says "choose exactly k/2 elements from each array", which could imply that duplicates are allowed, but in the examples, they seem to be choosing distinct elements.

To clarify, I need to see the problem constraints again.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2*10^5

- 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6

- 2 ≤ k ≤ 2*min(n, m)

- k is even

- Sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4*10^5

Given that k can be up to 2*min(n,m), and n and m can be up to 2*10^5, we need an efficient solution.

I think the key is to focus on the unique elements from 1 to k in both arrays.

So, perhaps I should consider the unique elements in a and b within [1, k], and then check the conditions I mentioned earlier.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose a = [1,2,3], b = [2,3,4], k=4

only_a = {1}

only_b = {4}

both = {2,3}

Total unique = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is equal to k=4.

We need to choose 2 elements from a and 2 from b.

Possible selection:

From a: 1,2

From b: 3,4

Union is {1,2,3,4}, which covers [1, k].

Another selection:

From a: 1,3

From b: 2,4

Union is {1,2,3,4}, which covers [1, k].

Seems possible.

Now, suppose a = [1,2,5], b = [2,3,4], k=4

only_a = {1,5}

only_b = {3,4}

both = {2}

Total unique = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5, which is greater than k=4.

But k=4, so we need to choose 2 from a and 2 from b.

Possible selection:

From a: 1,2

From b: 3,4

Union is {1,2,3,4}, which covers [1, k].

Another selection:

From a: 1,5

From b: 2,3

Union is {1,2,3,5}, which does not include 4.

Another selection:

From a: 1,2

From b: 2,4

Union is {1,2,4}, missing 3.

Wait, seems not all selections work.

But according to my earlier logic, since total unique is 5, which is greater than k=4, and neither only_a nor only_b exceed k/2=2, it should be possible.

But in this case, it seems it's not always possible.

Wait, maybe my logic is incomplete.

Let me think again.

Perhaps I need to ensure that the number of elements that are only in a does not exceed the remaining spots in a after choosing the required only_a elements.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of elements that are only in a and only in b.

Let me consider the minimal number of elements we need to choose from a and b.

We need to choose all only_a elements from a and all only_b elements from b.

Then, for the elements that are in both, we can choose them from either array to fulfill the remaining spots.

So, in the above example:

only_a = {1,5}

only_b = {3,4}

both = {2}

We need to choose both only_a elements from a, which are 1 and 5, but we can only choose 2 elements from a, and similarly 2 from b.

If we choose 1 and 5 from a, and 3 and 4 from b, the union is {1,3,4,5}, missing 2.

Alternatively, choose 1 and 2 from a, and 3 and 4 from b, union is {1,2,3,4}, missing 5, but 5 is beyond k=4, so it's okay.

Wait, 5 is beyond k=4, so it's irrelevant.

Wait, in this case, k=4, so we only care about elements 1 to 4.

So, in this selection, choosing 1 and 2 from a, and 3 and 4 from b, we cover [1,4].

Another selection: choose 1 and 5 from a, and 2 and 4 from b.

Union is {1,2,4,5}, which covers [1,4].

Wait, in this case, it does cover [1,4], so it's acceptable.

Wait, but earlier I thought it didn't, but actually, since 5 is beyond k=4, it's okay.

So, in this case, it is possible.

Maybe my initial approach is correct.

Let me consider another case where it's impossible.

Suppose a = [1,2], b = [3,4], k=4

only_a = {1,2}

only_b = {3,4}

both = {}

Total unique = 2 + 2 + 0 = 4 >= k=4

But we need to choose 2 from a and 2 from b.

Choosing 1 and 2 from a, and 3 and 4 from b, union is {1,2,3,4}, which covers [1,4].

So, possible.

Another case: a = [1,2,6], b = [3,4,5], k=4

only_a = {1,2,6}

only_b = {3,4,5}

both = {}

Total unique = 3 + 3 + 0 = 6 >= k=4

But only_a has 3 elements, which is more than k/2=2.

According to my earlier logic, if only_a > k/2, then it's impossible.

But in this case, we can choose 1 and 2 from a, and 3 and 4 from b, union is {1,2,3,4}, which covers [1,4].

So, in this case, even though only_a = 3 > 2, it's still possible.

Wait, does that mean my earlier condition is wrong?

Wait, according to my earlier condition, if only_a > k/2, then it's impossible.

But in this case, it's possible.

So, perhaps my condition is too strict.

Maybe I need to adjust it.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have x elements that are only in a, y elements that are only in b, and z elements that are in both.

I need to choose k/2 elements from a, which can be from only_a and both.

Similarly, choose k/2 from b, from only_b and both.

I need to cover all k elements.

So, the number of elements that are only in a is x.

Similarly, only in b is y.

And in both is z.

Total unique is x + y + z >= k.

Now, to cover all k elements, I need to make sure that the elements not covered by only_a and only_b are covered by the elements in both.

So, the number of elements that need to be covered from both is max(0, k - x - y).

Similarly, the number of elements I can choose from both is min(k/2 - x, z) from a and min(k/2 - y, z) from b.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me think about it in terms of the number of elements I need to choose from both.

If x <= k/2 and y <= k/2, then I can choose all only_a elements from a and all only_b elements from b.

Then, I need to choose the remaining elements from both to complete the k/2 choices in each array.

The remaining elements to choose from a is k/2 - x, and from b is k/2 - y.

And the number of elements in both is z.

As long as z >= (k - x - y), then it's possible.

Because I need to cover the remaining elements in both to reach k.

So, the condition should be:

- x <= k/2

- y <= k/2

- z >= k - x - y

If all these conditions are satisfied, then it's possible.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Let's test this with the earlier example where a = [1,2,6], b = [3,4,5], k=4

only_a = {1,2,6}

only_b = {3,4,5}

both = {}

So, x=3, y=3, z=0

Check:

- x <= 2? 3 <= 2? No, so impossible according to this condition.

But earlier, I thought it was possible to choose 1 and 2 from a, and 3 and 4 from b, which covers [1,4].

Wait, but according to the conditions, x=3 > 2, so it should be impossible.

But in reality, it's possible.

So, perhaps this condition is too strict.

Maybe I need to consider that elements beyond k in only_a or only_b don't matter, because they don't affect the coverage of [1,k].

In the above example, only_a = {1,2,6}, but 6 is greater than k=4, so it shouldn't be counted in x.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider only the elements from 1 to k in only_a and only_b.

So, only_a should be {1,2}, only_b should be {3,4}, both should be {}, and z=0.

Then, x=2, y=2, z=0

Check:

- x <= 2? Yes

- y <= 2? Yes

- z >= k - x - y = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0? Yes

So, it's possible.

Earlier, I mistakenly included 6 in only_a, but since k=4, elements greater than k should be ignored.

So, only_a should only include elements from 1 to k that are only in a.

Similarly for only_b.

So, in the second test case of the example:

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5], b = [1,3,8,10,3], k=6

only_a = {2,4,6}

only_b = {1}

both = {3,5}

Total unique = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 >= k=6

Check:

- x=3 <= 3? Yes

- y=1 <= 3? Yes

- z=2 >= 6 - 3 -1 = 2? Yes

So, it should be possible, but the problem says it's not possible.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the number of times an element appears in the array matters.

Wait, no, the problem says to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array, not necessarily distinct elements, but in the examples, they seem to choose distinct elements.

Wait, perhaps duplicates in the array allow multiple selections, but in the selection, duplicates don't help in covering more numbers from 1 to k.

So, perhaps I should only consider unique elements in a and b within [1, k].

Given that, in the second test case:

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5], unique a within [1,6] = {2,3,4,5,6}

b = [1,3,8,10,3], unique b within [1,6] = {1,3}

only_a = {2,4,6}

only_b = {1}

both = {3,5}

Then, x=3, y=1, z=2

Check:

- x <= 3? Yes

- y <= 3? Yes

- z >= 6 - 3 -1 = 2? Yes

So, according to this, it should be possible, but the problem says it's not possible.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the number of available elements in both arrays.

Wait, perhaps z needs to be at least the number of elements required from both to cover the missing parts.

But in this case, only_a = {2,4,6}, only_b = {1}, both = {3,5}

So, to cover [1,6], we need 1 from only_b, 2,4,6 from only_a, and 3,5 from both.

We can choose from a: 2,4,6 and from b:1,3,5.

But in b, 5 is not present, only 1 and 3.

Wait, no, b has [1,3,8,10,3], so within [1,6], it's {1,3}.

So, 5 is not in b.

Wait, in a, 5 is present.

So, both = {3,5}

But 5 is only in a, not in b, within [1,6].

Wait, no, b has 5 in it, but 5 is beyond k=6, but in b, b has [1,3,8,10,3], so within [1,6], only {1,3}.

Wait, 8 and 10 are beyond k=6, so only {1,3} are considered from b.

So, both = {3}

Then, only_a = {2,4,6}

only_b = {1}

both = {3,5}

Wait, but 5 is only in a, since b doesn't have 5.

So, both should only include elements that are in both a and b within [1, k].

So, both = {3}

Then, x=3, y=1, z=1

Check:

- x <= 3? Yes

- y <= 3? Yes

- z >= 6 - 3 -1 = 2? No, z=1 < 2

So, according to this, it's not possible, which matches the problem's indication that it's not possible.

Great, so this seems to be a correct condition.

So, to summarize:

- only_a: elements in a within [1,k] not in b

- only_b: elements in b within [1,k] not in a

- both: elements in both a and b within [1,k]

- x = len(only_a)

- y = len(only_b)

- z = len(both)

- Check:

- x <= k/2

- y <= k/2

- z >= k - x - y

If all these are true, then it's possible; else, it's not possible.

This seems to be an efficient way to check for each test case, as we can compute the sets and their sizes in linear time relative to the size of a and b.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program reads t test cases, each with n, m, k, followed by arrays a and b.

It stores all test cases in a list called cases.

Then, it calls func_1(t, cases) to process all test cases and get the results, which it then prints.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(t, cases):

results = []

for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:

unique_a = set(a)

unique_b = set(b)

relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}

relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}

only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b

only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a

both = relevant_a & relevant_b

if len(only_a) > k // 2:

results.append('NO')

continue

if len(only_b) > k // 2:

results.append('NO')

continue

total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)

if total_distinct < k:

results.append('NO')

continue

results.append('YES')

return results

So, it does the following:

1. Computes unique elements in a and b.

2. Filters elements in a and b that are <= k.

3. Computes only_a, only_b, and both as sets.

4. Checks if len(only_a) > k//2 or len(only_b) > k//2, in which case it's 'NO'.

5. Checks if the total distinct relevant elements < k, in which case it's 'NO'.

6. Otherwise, it's 'YES'.

Comparing this to my earlier logic:

- Check x <= k/2 (len(only_a) <= k//2)

- Check y <= k/2 (len(only_b) <= k//2)

- Check z >= k - x - y (len(both) >= k - len(only_a) - len(only_b))

However, in the code, it checks:

- len(only_a) > k//2: 'NO'

- len(only_b) > k//2: 'NO'

- total_distinct < k: 'NO'

- else: 'YES'

Wait, but total_distinct is len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both), which should be equal to the total unique elements from 1 to k in both arrays.

So, the condition total_distinct >= k ensures that there are enough unique elements to cover [1, k].

But, in my earlier logic, I had an additional condition: z >= k - x - y.

Is this already covered by total_distinct >= k?

Wait, total_distinct = x + y + z >= k

And z >= k - x - y

These two are equivalent, because z >= k - x - y is the same as x + y + z >= k.

So, in the code, checking total_distinct >= k already implies that z >= k - x - y, assuming x + y + z >= k.

Wait, no.

Wait, x + y + z >= k is total_distinct >= k.

And z >= k - x - y is equivalent to z >= k - (x + y), which is the same as z >= k - (x + y).

But z can be less than k - x - y even if x + y + z >= k.

Wait, no.

Wait, suppose x + y + z >= k, and z >= k - x - y.

These two are equivalent.

Because z >= k - x - y is the same as x + y + z >= k.

So, in the code, checking total_distinct >= k is sufficient for z >= k - x - y.

Therefore, the code correctly implements the conditions I derived.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Correctness: True}}
