Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and set the prices in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES" along with the number of stalls and their prices. If not, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels. Bob can set up to 60 stalls with prices between 1 and 10^18 coins per jewel.

Alice's buying behavior is greedy: she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then moves to the next, and so on, until she has bought k jewels or has no more coins left.

I need to figure out if it's possible for Bob to set up the stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Let me think about some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

3

7 3

6 4

255 8

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

NO

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

In the first test case, with 7 coins and wanting to buy 3 jewels, Bob sets up 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11 coins per jewel. Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall (7 // 2 = 3 jewels, spending 6 coins), and then has 1 coin left, which is not enough to buy anything from the other stalls. So, she buys exactly 3 jewels.

In the third test case, with 255 coins and wanting to buy 8 jewels, Bob sets up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 coins per jewel. Alice buys one jewel from each stall, spending 128, then 64, then 32, and so on, until she has spent all 255 coins and bought 8 jewels.

Now, looking at the second test case, with 6 coins and wanting to buy 4 jewels, it's "NO". So, it's impossible to set up stalls in a way that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Let me try to think about why that is.

If Alice has 6 coins and needs to buy exactly 4 jewels, she needs to buy jewels in such a way that the total number of jewels bought from all stalls is exactly 4.

Let's consider some possible stall setups.

Suppose Bob sets up one stall with price 1 coin per jewel. Alice would buy 6 jewels (6 // 1 = 6), which is more than 4, so that's not good.

If he sets up two stalls: first with price 2 coins, second with price 1 coin.

From the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels (6 // 2 = 3), spending 6 coins, and then has 0 coins left for the second stall. Total jewels bought: 3, which is less than 4.

Alternatively, first stall price 1 coin, second stall price 2 coins.

From the first stall, buys 6 jewels (6 // 1 = 6), which is already more than 4, so that's not good.

Another option: first stall price 1.5 coins, but prices have to be integers, so that's invalid.

Wait, prices have to be integers between 1 and 10^18 coins.

So, in this case, it seems impossible to get exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Let me see if there's a way.

Suppose Bob sets up three stalls: first with price 2 coins, second with price 2 coins, third with price 1 coin.

From the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels (6 // 2 = 3), spending 6 coins, and has 0 coins left for the other stalls. Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Another setup: first stall price 1 coin, second stall price 2 coins.

From first stall: 6 jewels, which is more than 4, so not good.

First stall price 1 coin, second stall price 3 coins.

From first stall: 6 jewels, which is more than 4.

First stall price 2 coins, second stall price 3 coins.

From first stall: 3 jewels, spending 6 coins, has 0 for the second stall. Total jewels: 3, less than 4.

First stall price 1 coin, second stall price 4 coins.

From first stall: 6 jewels, which is more than 4.

First stall price 3 coins, second stall price 4 coins.

From first stall: 2 jewels (6 // 3 = 2), spending 6 coins, has 0 for the second stall. Total jewels: 2, less than 4.

Seems like in all possible setups with integer prices between 1 and 10^18, and up to 60 stalls, Alice either buys more than 4 or less than 4 jewels, but never exactly 4. Hence, "NO" is the correct answer for this case.

Now, I need to generalize this to any n and k.

Constraints are:

- 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (number of test cases)

- 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 (coins and jewels)

So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(t * log n) or something like that, since n can be up to 10^18.

First, let's consider some basic observations.

If n < k, it's impossible for Alice to buy k jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. So, in this case, the answer is "NO".

If n == k, Bob can set up a single stall with price 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy k jewels, spending k coins, which matches n. So, "YES" with 1 stall of price 1.

If n > k, we need to find a way to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Let me think about the minimal number of stalls needed.

In the example with n=7 and k=3, they used 10 stalls, but probably fewer would suffice.

In the third example, with n=255 and k=8, they used 8 stalls with prices that are powers of 2, which is a common greedy approach.

Wait, in the third example, the prices are 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, which are powers of 2. This is similar to binary representation.

In binary representation, any number can be represented as the sum of powers of 2.

So, if Bob sets up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, Alice will buy one jewel from each stall until she has bought k jewels or has no coins left.

In the third example, with n=255 and k=8, since 255 in binary is 11111111, which is 8 bits set to 1, so Alice buys one jewel from each of the 8 stalls, spending 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255 coins, buying exactly 8 jewels.

This seems promising.

So, perhaps in general, if Bob sets up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, Alice will buy one jewel from each stall until she has bought k jewels or has no coins left.

But wait, this only works if k is less than or equal to the number of bits set to 1 in n's binary representation.

Wait, no. Actually, with powers of 2, Alice will buy one jewel from each stall in order, spending the largest possible amounts first.

Wait, but in the example, with n=255 and k=8, it worked because 255 is 255 in decimal, which is 11111111 in binary, and there are 8 bits set, so she buys one from each stall.

But suppose n=5 and k=2.

If Bob sets up stalls with prices 4, 1.

From first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel, spending 4 coins, left with 1 coin.

From second stall, buys 1 jewel, spending 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels: 2, which matches k=2.

Another example: n=6, k=4.

If Bob sets up stalls with prices 4, 2, 1.

From first stall: buys 1 jewel, spends 4 coins, left with 2 coins.

From second stall: buys 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels: 2, which is less than 4.

Not enough.

Another setup: stalls with prices 2, 1.

From first stall: buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels: 3, less than 4.

Another setup: stalls with prices 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,... up to 60 stalls.

But in this case, Alice would buy as many as possible from the first stall: 6 jewels, which is more than 4.

Wait, but the problem allows up to 60 stalls, but I need to find a setup where Alice buys exactly k jewels.

It seems tricky.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall in order.

So, for stall i with price p_i, she buys floor(n / p_i) jewels, and then n = n - p_i * floor(n / p_i).

She does this for each stall until she has bought k jewels or has no coins left.

I need to choose p_i such that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

One approach could be to set up stalls with decreasing prices, so that she buys fewer jewels from each subsequent stall.

But it's not clear how to choose the prices optimally.

Let me consider a simpler case first.

Suppose Bob sets up only one stall with price p.

Then, Alice buys floor(n / p) jewels.

So, we need floor(n / p) = k.

This implies that p = floor(n / k).

But wait, floor(n / p) = k implies that p = floor(n / k).

But this might not give exactly k jewels, because floor(n / p) could be larger or smaller than k.

Wait, actually, if p = floor(n / k), then floor(n / p) >= k, but it might be larger than k.

For example, n=7, k=3.

floor(7/3)=2, so p=2.

Then, floor(7/2)=3 jewels, which is exactly k=3.

Another example: n=6, k=4.

floor(6/4)=1, so p=1.

Then, floor(6/1)=6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

So, in this case, it's not possible to set p=1 because it results in more than k jewels.

Wait, but in this setup, Alice buys all jewels from the first stall, since p=1.

So, total jewels bought: 6, which is more than 4.

Hence, it's not suitable.

So, setting a single stall with p=floor(n/k) only works if floor(n/p)=k, but in the second case, it doesn't.

So, perhaps I need to set up multiple stalls.

Let me think about setting up two stalls.

Suppose Bob sets up two stalls with prices p1 and p2.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels from the first stall, spends p1 * floor(n / p1) coins, then moves to the second stall and buys floor((n - p1 * floor(n / p1)) / p2) jewels.

Total jewels bought: floor(n / p1) + floor((n - p1 * floor(n / p1)) / p2)

I need this to be equal to k.

I need to choose p1 and p2 such that this sum is exactly k.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can generalize it.

If Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels from the first stall, spends p1 * floor(n / p1) coins.

Then, buys floor((n - p1 * floor(n / p1)) / p2) from the second, and so on.

Total jewels bought: sum over i from 1 to s of floor(n_i / p_i), where n_i is the remaining coins after buying from previous stalls.

This is getting too involved.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls needed.

In the first example, they used 10 stalls, but maybe fewer would suffice.

In the third example, they used 8 stalls.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so we have some flexibility.

Wait, 60 is less than or equal to the number of bits in 10^18, which is 60 bits, since 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is within the range.

So, perhaps using a binary-like representation could work.

Let me consider that.

Suppose Bob sets up stalls with prices that are powers of some base, like 2.

In the third example, they used powers of 2: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Alice buys one jewel from each stall, spending the price of that jewel.

This works because each price is distinct and a power of 2, so the total spent is the sum of the prices of the jewels bought.

In this case, since n=255 and the sum of the prices is also 255, and k=8, which matches the number of stalls.

But in other cases, this might not work.

For example, n=7 and k=3.

If Bob sets up stalls with prices 4, 2, 1.

From first stall: buys 1 jewel, spends 4 coins, left with 3.

From second stall: buys 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, left with 1.

From third stall: buys 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0.

Total jewels: 3, which matches k=3.

So, in this case, it works with 3 stalls.

Similarly, in the first example, they used 10 stalls, but it could have used fewer.

So, perhaps setting up stalls with decreasing prices, where each price is as large as possible without exceeding the remaining coins, could work.

But I need to ensure that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the minimal number of stalls needed.

In the worst case, if k=1, Bob can set up one stall with p=n, and Alice buys one jewel.

If k=n, Bob can set up one stall with p=1, and Alice buys n jewels.

If k is between 1 and n, Bob needs to set up stalls in a way that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

Wait, but in the second example, with n=6 and k=4, it's impossible, as we saw earlier.

So, I need to find a general condition for when it's possible.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy.

Minimal number of jewels: if Bob sets up a single stall with p=floor(n/(k-1)) +1, then Alice buys floor(n/p) jewels, which is less than or equal to k-1.

Wait, no, that might not hold.

Actually, with a single stall, the number of jewels bought is floor(n/p), and we need this to be equal to k.

But as we've seen, this might not be possible if floor(n/p) != k.

So, perhaps with multiple stalls, I can adjust the total jewels bought.

Let me consider that the total jewels bought is the sum of floor(n_i / p_i) for each stall i, where n_i is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

This seems complicated to handle directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of the remaining coins after each stall.

Let me try to model it recursively.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls.

Let r0 = n (initial coins)

After first stall: buy floor(r0 / p1) jewels, remaining r1 = r0 - p1 * floor(r0 / p1)

After second stall: buy floor(r1 / p2) jewels, remaining r2 = r1 - p2 * floor(r1 / p2)

...

After s-th stall: buy floor(rs-1 / ps) jewels, remaining rs = rs-1 - ps * floor(rs-1 / ps)

Total jewels bought: sum from i=1 to s of floor(ri-1 / pi)

We need this sum to be equal to k.

This seems too involved to handle directly.

Perhaps I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal number of stalls needed is equal to k.

If Bob sets up k stalls, each with price p_i such that sum of p_i <= n, and floor(n / p_i) =1 for each i.

Wait, but floor(n / p_i) =1 implies that p_i > n - p_i, which might not hold.

This seems messy.

Another idea: perhaps Bob can set up stalls with prices that force Alice to buy exactly one jewel from each stall.

If Bob sets up stalls with prices that are strictly decreasing, and adjusted in such a way that Alice has just enough to buy one jewel from each stall.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try with n=7 and k=3.

Suppose Bob sets up three stalls with prices 3, 2, 2.

From first stall: floor(7/3)=2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin.

From second stall: floor(1/2)=0 jewels.

From third stall: floor(1/2)=0 jewels.

Total jewels: 2, which is less than 3.

Not good.

Another setup: stalls with prices 3, 2, 1.

From first stall: floor(7/3)=2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin.

From second stall: floor(1/2)=0 jewels.

From third stall: floor(1/1)=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels: 3, which matches k=3.

So, in this case, it works with three stalls.

But in the first example, they used 10 stalls, but it's possible with fewer.

So, perhaps the minimal number of stalls needed is related to the number of times Alice can buy jewels from different stalls.

But I need a general approach.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n_i / p_i) over i from 1 to s equals k, where n_i is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I can consider that the total jewels bought is the sum of floor(n / p_i) for i from 1 to s, assuming that n_i depends on previous p_i's.

Wait, but n_i depends on p1 to p_{i-1}, so it's interdependent.

This seems too recursive and hard to manage directly.

Let me consider that the total jewels bought is at least the ceiling of k, and try to adjust the prices accordingly.

No, that's not helpful.

Another idea: perhaps I can model this as a Diophantine equation.

Let me consider that Alice buys a_i jewels from stall i, where a_i = floor(n_i / p_i), and n_i is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

Then, the total jewels bought is sum of a_i from i=1 to s, and I need this sum to be equal to k.

This seems too general.

Maybe I need to find a way to partition the jewels bought across the stalls such that the total is k.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of partitioning k into s parts, where s is the number of stalls.

But in this case, k is the total jewels bought, which is the sum of floor(n_i / p_i) across all stalls.

This still seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of the remaining coins.

Suppose Alice buys jewels from s stalls, and after buying from stall s, she has no coins left or cannot buy any more jewels.

I need to ensure that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

This seems too broad.

Let me consider that for a given n and k, it's possible to buy exactly k jewels if and only if n >= k and there exists a set of stall prices such that the sum of floor(n_i / p_i) equals k.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that if Bob sets up stalls with prices that are factors of n, it might be easier to control the number of jewels bought.

But prices don't have to be factors of n.

Wait, prices can be any integer between 1 and 10^18.

This seems too flexible.

Let me consider that if Bob sets up stalls with prices that are greater than the remaining coins divided by the remaining jewels needed, he can control the number of jewels bought at each stall.

This sounds promising.

Let me formalize it.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Let's define that after buying from stall i, Alice has bought a_i jewels, and has r_i coins remaining.

Initially, r0 = n, and the total jewels bought is sum of a_i from i=1 to s, which should equal k.

Each a_i = floor(r_{i-1} / p_i)

I need to choose p_i such that sum of a_i equals k.

This seems too vague still.

Let me consider that for each stall, p_i should be set such that a_i is as desired.

But I need to determine the desired a_i for each stall.

Perhaps I can decide how many jewels Alice should buy from each stall.

Let's say I want her to buy a1 jewels from stall 1, a2 from stall 2, and so on, up to as from stall s, such that a1 + a2 + ... + as = k.

Then, for each stall i, I can set p_i = ceil((r_{i-1}) / a_i)

But I need to ensure that with this p_i, floor(r_{i-1} / p_i) = a_i.

Wait, let's see.

If I set p_i = ceil(r_{i-1} / a_i), then floor(r_{i-1} / p_i) = a_i, provided that p_i divides r_{i-1} appropriately.

Wait, is this always true?

Let me verify.

Suppose p_i = ceil(r_{i-1} / a_i)

Then, floor(r_{i-1} / p_i) = floor(r_{i-1} / ceil(r_{i-1} / a_i))

I need to see if this equals a_i.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose r_{i-1} = 7, a_i = 3.

Then, p_i = ceil(7/3) = 3.

Then, floor(7/3) = 2, which is not equal to a_i=3.

Hmm, that doesn't work.

Another example: r_{i-1}=6, a_i=4.

p_i=ceil(6/4)=2.

floor(6/2)=3, which is not equal to a_i=4.

Not working.

Another example: r_{i-1}=10, a_i=5.

p_i=ceil(10/5)=2.

floor(10/2)=5, which matches a_i=5.

Wait, in this case, it works.

But in the previous examples, it didn't.

So, perhaps it depends on the values.

I need to find a condition where floor(r_{i-1} / p_i) = a_i.

Given p_i = ceil(r_{i-1} / a_i), does floor(r_{i-1} / p_i) = a_i hold?

Let me consider the general case.

Let q = ceil(r_{i-1} / a_i)

Then, floor(r_{i-1} / q)

I need to see if floor(r_{i-1} / q) = a_i.

This seems to hold when q divides r_{i-1} appropriately.

But in the first example, r_{i-1}=7, a_i=3, q=3, floor(7/3)=2 !=3.

In the second example, r_{i-1}=6, a_i=4, q=2, floor(6/2)=3 !=4.

In the third example, r_{i-1}=10, a_i=5, q=2, floor(10/2)=5=5.

So, it works in some cases but not others.

This approach seems inconsistent.

Maybe I need to choose p_i such that floor(r_{i-1} / p_i) = a_i.

This implies that p_i must satisfy r_{i-1} / p_i >= a_i and r_{i-1} / p_i < a_i +1.

Which implies that p_i <= floor(r_{i-1} / a_i) and p_i > ceil(r_{i-1} / (a_i +1))

Wait, let's see.

floor(r_{i-1} / p_i) = a_i implies that a_i <= r_{i-1} / p_i < a_i +1

Which implies that p_i > r_{i-1} / (a_i +1) and p_i <= r_{i-1} / a_i

So, p_i should be in (r_{i-1} / (a_i +1), r_{i-1} / a_i]

Since p_i must be an integer, p_i should be in ceil(r_{i-1} / (a_i +1)) to floor(r_{i-1} / a_i)

So, for each stall i, p_i should be in [ceil(r_{i-1} / (a_i +1)), floor(r_{i-1} / a_i)]

But I don't know a_i or r_{i-1} in advance.

This seems too convoluted.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that if Bob sets up stalls with decreasing prices, starting from the highest possible price that allows Alice to buy as few jewels as possible from each stall.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: perhaps it's always possible to set up stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels, unless n < k or some other condition.

But in the second example, n=6 and k=4, it's impossible, so there must be some condition beyond n >=k.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy.

Minimal number of jewels: if Bob sets up a single stall with p=1, Alice buys n jewels.

Maximal number of jewels: if Bob sets up many stalls with high prices, Alice buys fewer jewels from each stall.

Wait, no, if Bob sets up many stalls with p > n, Alice buys 0 jewels from each stall, but that's not helpful.

Wait, in this problem, Alice always buys at least one jewel from a stall if she has enough coins for it.

Wait, no, if p > n, then floor(n / p) =0, so she buys 0 jewels.

So, in that case, she skips the stall.

Hence, to make her buy jewels, p should be <= n.

So, to maximize the number of jewels bought, Bob should set up stalls with p=1, so she buys n jewels from the first stall.

But in that case, she buys n jewels, which may be more than k.

So, to make her buy exactly k jewels, Bob needs to set up stalls in such a way that the sum of floor(n_i / p_i) equals k.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the total jewels bought is the sum of floor(n / p_i) for each stall, but adjusted for the remaining coins after each stall.

This is too recursive.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the minimal and maximal possible jewels bought.

Let me consider that the minimal number of stalls needed is ceil(k / m), where m is the maximal number of jewels Alice can buy from a single stall.

But m can be up to n, if p=1.

So, that doesn't help.

Another idea: perhaps it's always possible to set up stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels, as long as n >=k, by setting up stalls with prices that force her to buy exactly one jewel from each stall, up to k stalls.

But in the second example, with n=6 and k=4, even if Bob sets up 4 stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy one jewel from each, it's not possible because 4*1=4 coins, but Alice has 6 coins, so she would buy more jewels from other stalls if their prices are <= remaining coins.

Wait, no.

If Bob sets up 4 stalls with prices p1, p2, p3, p4, and Alice buys one from each, spending p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 coins, but then if she has remaining coins >= p5, she would buy from the fifth stall, which is not desired.

Hence, to prevent her from buying more jewels, Bob needs to set up stalls in such a way that after buying k jewels, she doesn't have enough coins to buy from any other stall.

This seems promising.

So, perhaps Bob should set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that after buying k jewels, Alice has less than p_{s+1} coins left, so she can't buy any more jewels.

But in this problem, Alice buys from stalls in order until she has bought from all s stalls or has no coins left.

Hence, to make her buy exactly k jewels, Bob needs to set up stalls such that after buying from some stalls, she has bought exactly k jewels and doesn't have enough coins to buy from any more stalls.

Wait, perhaps Bob can set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where s <=60, such that the sum of the costs of the first k jewels equals n, and the cost of the (k+1)-th jewel is greater than the remaining coins.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1 >= p2 >= ... >= ps.

Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall in order.

To make her buy exactly k jewels, Bob needs to set up stalls such that the sum of the jewels bought from the first t stalls is less than or equal to k, and the sum up to s stalls is exactly k.

This still seems too general.

Let me consider that Bob can set up stalls with prices that correspond to the cost per jewel that Alice is willing to pay.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal and maximal possible prices.

Another idea: perhaps it's always possible unless n < k or some specific conditions.

But in the second example, n=6 and k=4, it's impossible.

So, perhaps there are some constraints based on the binary representation or something similar.

Wait, in the third example, with n=255 and k=8, it's possible by setting up stalls with prices that are powers of 2.

Similarly, in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that Bob can set up stalls with prices that correspond to the cost per jewel that allows Alice to buy exactly one jewel from each stall, up to k stalls, and then set the remaining stalls with prices higher than the remaining coins.

Wait, perhaps.

Suppose Bob sets up k stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 >= p2 >= ... >= pk, and pk <= remaining coins after buying from previous stalls.

Wait, it's getting too involved.

Let me consider that Bob sets up k stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 <= n, p2 <= (n - p1)/1, and so on.

This seems too recursive.

Maybe I need to find a way to partition n coins into k jewels, considering that each jewel has a certain price.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as finding k positive integers (prices) that sum up to n, but arranged in such a way that Alice buys one jewel from each stall.

But in reality, Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall, so it's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps I need to set up stalls with prices that are greater than the average cost per jewel.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me consider that Bob can set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where s <=60, and choose p_i such that the sum of floor(n / p_i) over i from 1 to s equals k.

But again, this is too vague.

Let me consider that Bob can set up s=2 stalls.

Suppose he sets up stall 1 with price p1, and stall 2 with price p2.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels from stall 1, spends p1 * floor(n / p1) coins, then buys floor((n - p1 * floor(n / p1)) / p2) jewels from stall 2.

Total jewels: a1 + a2 = k.

I need to choose p1 and p2 such that a1 + a2 =k.

This seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to find a general condition for when it's possible.

Let me consider that if n >=k and n -k < p, where p is the price of the last stall, then Alice can't buy more jewels.

Wait, I'm getting lost.

Let me consider that Bob can set up s stalls with prices p1 >= p2 >= ... >= ps.

Alice buys as many jewels as possible from p1, then from p2, and so on.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n_i / p_i) equals k.

This seems too broad.

Let me consider that Bob can set up s=2 stalls.

Let me see if I can find a general solution for s=2.

Suppose Bob sets up two stalls with prices p1 and p2, where p1 >= p2.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels from the first stall, spends p1 * floor(n / p1) coins, then buys floor((n - p1 * floor(n / p1)) / p2) jewels from the second stall.

Total jewels: a1 + a2 =k.

I need to choose p1 and p2 such that a1 + a2 =k.

Let me denote r1 = n - p1 * floor(n / p1), which is the remaining coins after the first stall.

Then, a2 = floor(r1 / p2)

So, a1 + a2 = floor(n / p1) + floor(r1 / p2) =k

This seems too involved to solve directly.

Perhaps I need to consider that for s=2, it's possible under certain conditions.

But this doesn't seem to lead me to a general solution.

Let me consider that Bob can set up s=60 stalls, which is the maximum allowed.

Given that 60 is a relatively large number, perhaps I can find a way to set up stalls with decreasing prices, starting from a high price down to 1, in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

But I need a systematic way to choose the prices.

Another idea: perhaps I can use the greedy algorithm, where Bob sets up stalls with the highest possible price that allows Alice to buy at least one jewel, and then adjust the remaining stalls accordingly.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me consider that Bob can set up stalls with prices that correspond to the cost per jewel that Alice is willing to pay, based on her remaining coins.

But I'm not sure.

At this point, I think I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Bob can set up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly k jewels by controlling the number of jewels bought at each stall.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

He can choose p1 such that Alice buys a1 jewels from the first stall, then p2 such that she buys a2 jewels from the second, and so on, up to s stalls, where a1 + a2 + ... + as =k.

To achieve this, Bob needs to set p_i such that floor(n_i / p_i) =a_i, where n_i is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

From the earlier analysis, p_i should be in (n_i / (a_i +1), n_i / a_i]

But p_i must be integers, so p_i = ceil(n_i / (a_i +1)) to floor(n_i / a_i)

So, if I can choose a_i such that sum of a_i =k and p_i fall within these bounds for each i, then it's possible.

But choosing the right a_i for each stall is not straightforward.

Perhaps I can start by setting a1 =k-1 and a2=1, and see if p1 and p2 can be chosen accordingly.

But this seems too ad-hoc.

Another idea: perhaps it's always possible unless n <k or n =k and k=1.

Wait, no, in the second example, n=6 and k=4, which is n >=k, but it's impossible.

So, there must be some other condition.

Let me consider that if n >=k and n -k < p, where p is the price of the last stall, then Alice can't buy more jewels.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose Bob sets up s=2 stalls.

He sets p1 = ceil(n /k), and p2=1.

Then, Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels from the first stall, spends p1 * floor(n / p1) coins, then buys floor((n - p1 * floor(n / p1)) / p2) jewels from the second stall.

Total jewels: floor(n / p1) + floor((n - p1 * floor(n / p1)) / p2)

Let me see if this can equal k.

Let me plug in n=7, k=3.

p1 = ceil(7/3)=3

floor(7/3)=2 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 1 coin.

Then, p2=1, floor(1/1)=1 jewel.

Total jewels: 2 +1=3, which matches k=3.

Another example: n=6, k=4.

p1=ceil(6/4)=2

floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

Then, p2=1, floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

Total jewels: 3 +0=3, which is less than k=4.

So, in this case, it doesn't work.

Wait, but if I set p2 to a higher value, say p2=2.

Then, after buying 3 jewels from the first stall, remaining 0 coins, can't buy from the second stall.

Still, total jewels:3, less than 4.

Another setup: p1=ceil(6/4)=2, p2=1.

Same as before.

Alternatively, p1=2, p2=3.

From p1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

From p2: floor(0/3)=0 jewels.

Total:3, less than 4.

Another setup: p1=3, p2=2.

From p1: floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

From p2: floor(0/2)=0 jewels.

Total:2, less than 4.

Not working.

Another setup: p1=4, p2=2.

From p1: floor(6/4)=1 jewel, spends 4 coins, remaining 2 coins.

From p2: floor(2/2)=1 jewel, spends 2 coins, remaining 0 coins.

Total:1 +1=2, less than 4.

Still not enough.

Another setup: p1=1, p2=1.

From p1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

Total jewels:6, more than 4.

Not good.

So, with s=2, it's not possible to get exactly k=4 jewels with n=6 coins.

Hence, "NO" is the correct answer for this case.

Now, I need a general way to determine if it's possible for any n and k.

Looking back at the examples, it seems that in some cases, it's possible, and in others, it's not.

I need to find a condition that determines when it's possible.

Let me consider that it's possible if and only if there exists a combination of stall prices such that the sum of floor(n_i / p_i) equals k.

But this is just rephrasing the problem.

I need something more concrete.

Let me consider that if n >=k and n -k < p, where p is the price of the last stall, then Alice can't buy more jewels.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice buys jewels in a way that minimizes the number of jewels bought if p is large, or maximizes if p is small.

But I need to control the total to be exactly k.

Another idea: perhaps it's possible if and only if n >=k and n -k < p for some p.

Wait, not sure.

Let me consider that if n >=k and n -k < p, where p is the price of the last stall, then Alice can't buy more jewels after k.

But I need to ensure that she buys exactly k jewels.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that Bob can set up s stalls with prices p1 >= p2 >= ... >= ps.

Alice buys as many as possible from p1, then from p2, and so on.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n_i / p_i) equals k.

This seems too broad.

Perhaps I need to consider that the minimal number of stalls needed is equal to k, and each stall has p_i > (n - sum_{j=1}^{i-1} p_j * a_j) / (k - sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j)

But this is too involved.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that it's always possible unless n <k or n =k and k=1.

Wait, but in the second example, n=6 and k=4, which is n >=k, but it's impossible.

So, there must be some other condition.

Let me consider that it's possible if and only if n >=k and k <= the minimal number of jewels Alice can buy with n coins.

Wait, no, in the second example, n=6, k=4, but the minimal number of jewels Alice can buy is 3 (with p1=2, p2=1: buys 3 from p1 and 0 from p2), which is less than 4.

Hence, it's impossible.

Wait, but in another setup, p1=3, p2=2: buys 2 from p1 and 0 from p2, total 2.

Still less than 4.

Hence, it's impossible.

So, perhaps the condition is that if the minimal number of jewels Alice can buy is less than or equal to k, and the maximal number is greater than or equal to k, then it's possible.

But in the second example, minimal is
