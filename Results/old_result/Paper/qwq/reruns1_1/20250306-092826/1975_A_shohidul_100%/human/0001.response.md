Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Mocha has an array of positive integers, and she can perform this specific operation on it any number of times. The operation is to split the array into a prefix and a suffix, swap them, and concatenate them back together. For example, if you have [3,1,4,1,5], you can split it into [3,1] and [4,1,5], then swap to get [4,1,5,3,1]. The goal is to determine if, after performing this operation any number of times, the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. It's about splitting the array into two parts at some index and swapping those parts. So, for an array of length n, possible splits are at index 1 to n-1. For example, for n=4, splits can be after the first element, after the second, or after the third.

I need to consider that this operation can be performed any number of times. So, it's not just about doing it once but potentially multiple times.

My task is to check, for each test case, whether it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using these operations.

Let me think about the properties of this operation. If I split the array at index i, swap the prefix and suffix, and concatenate, it's like rotating the array. Wait, is it exactly like rotating? Let's see. Rotating an array means shifting elements by k positions. But in this operation, it's splitting into two parts and swapping them.

For example, with [3,1,4,1,5]:

- Split after index 1: [3] and [1,4,1,5], swap to get [1,4,1,5,3]

- Split after index 2: [3,1] and [4,1,5], swap to get [4,1,5,3,1]

- Split after index 3: [3,1,4] and [1,5], swap to get [1,5,3,1,4]

- Split after index 4: [3,1,4,1] and [5], swap to get [5,3,1,4,1]

So, it's not exactly like a single rotation, but it's similar in that it reorders the elements by moving a part of the array to the front or back.

I need to see if, by performing such operations multiple times, I can sort the array.

First, I should consider that if the array is already sorted, I don't need to do anything. So, in that case, the answer is "Yes".

But if it's not sorted, I need to check if it's possible to sort it using these operations.

Let me think about the effect of performing this operation multiple times.

Suppose I perform the operation once: split at some point, swap prefix and suffix.

If I perform it again, I split the new array at some point and swap again.

I need to see if repeated such operations can achieve a sorted array.

Wait a minute, maybe there's a smarter way to look at this.

Let me consider that each operation is a permutation of the array. Specifically, it's a operation that splits the array into two parts and swaps them.

So, if I perform this operation multiple times, I'm applying a sequence of such permutations.

I need to see if, by applying such permutations, I can reach the sorted version of the array.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of cycles or something in permutation group theory, but that might be overkill for this problem.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Suppose I have the array [2,1,3]. Is it possible to sort it using these operations?

Possible operations:

- Split after index 1: [2] and [1,3], swap to get [1,3,2]

- Split after index 2: [2,1] and [3], swap to get [3,2,1]

Neither of these is sorted. So, in this case, it's not possible to sort the array using these operations.

Wait, but according to the sample input, [7,9,2,2,3] can be sorted by performing operations.

Let me see what operations they performed in the example.

First, split into x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3], swap to get [9,2,2,3,7].

Then, split into x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7], swap to get [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

So, by performing two operations, they sorted the array.

This suggests that performing multiple operations can lead to sorting.

Now, I need a general way to determine if sorting is possible for any given array.

Let me consider the array as a circular list, since the operations allow me to rotate parts of it in a way.

In a sorted array, the elements are in non-decreasing order.

If I think of the array as circular, I can look for a rotation that makes it sorted.

But in this problem, it's not exactly rotation, but splitting into prefix and suffix and swapping them.

Wait, but swapping prefix and suffix is similar to reversing those parts in a way.

Let me consider the array as a sequence that can be split and swapped multiple times.

I need to see if I can rearrange the array into sorted order using these operations.

An alternative approach: since each operation is reversible (since swapping prefix and suffix again would bring it back), the operations form a group.

But maybe that's too complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a split point and see what happens.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a way to arrange the array such that it's sorted.

One idea is to find a way to arrange the array so that it's sorted in parts.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of merging sorted sequences.

Let me consider that if I can split the array into two sorted subarrays, and then swap them, I might be able to sort the whole array.

But that might not always be the case.

Wait, in the sample input, [7,9,2,2,3], splitting into [7,9] and [2,2,3], both sorted, but in wrong order. By swapping, we get [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

So, in this case, it worked because both parts were sorted, and the maximum of the first part was less than or equal to the minimum of the second part.

Wait, but in this case, [7,9] and [2,2,3], max of first part is 9, min of second part is 2, and 9 > 2, so it's not in order. But after swapping, it becomes [2,2,3,7,9], where max of first part [2,2,3] is 3, and min of second part [7,9] is 7, and 3 <=7, so it's sorted.

So, perhaps, if I can split the array into two parts where the maximum of the second part is less than or equal to the minimum of the first part after swapping, then I can sort it.

Wait, more generally, if I can split the array into two parts, where the second part is sorted, the first part is sorted, and the maximum of the second part is less than or equal to the minimum of the first part, then swapping them will result in a sorted array.

In the sample input, [7,9,2,2,3]:

- Split into [7,9] and [2,2,3]

- [7,9] is sorted, [2,2,3] is sorted

- max of [2,2,3] is 3, min of [7,9] is 7, and 3 <=7

- After swapping, [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

So, in this case, it works.

Another example, [1,1,4,5,1,4]:

- Can I split it into two sorted parts where the max of the second part is <= min of the first part?

Let's try splitting at different points:

- Split into [1,1,4] and [5,1,4]

- [1,1,4] is sorted, [5,1,4] is not sorted

- So, this doesn't satisfy the condition

- Split into [1,1] and [4,5,1,4]

- [1,1] is sorted, [4,5,1,4] is not sorted

- Doesn't satisfy

- Split into [1,1,4,5] and [1,4]

- [1,1,4,5] is sorted, [1,4] is sorted

- max of [1,4] is 4, min of [1,1,4,5] is 1, but 4 >1, which doesn't satisfy the condition

- After swapping, [1,4,1,1,4,5], which is not sorted

- Split into [1] and [1,4,5,1,4]

- [1] is sorted, [1,4,5,1,4] is not sorted

- Doesn't satisfy

- Split into [1,1,4,5,1] and [4]

- [1,1,4,5,1] is not sorted, [4] is sorted

- Doesn't satisfy

So, in this case, there's no way to split the array into two sorted parts where the max of the second part is <= min of the first part. Hence, it's "No".

Another example, [1,2,3]:

- It's already sorted, so "Yes"

- Or, if I split into [1,2] and [3], swap to get [3,1,2], which is not sorted

- Or split into [1] and [2,3], swap to get [2,3,1], which is not sorted

- So, in this case, it's already sorted, so "Yes"

From these observations, it seems that if the array is already sorted, output "Yes"

If it's not sorted, check if there exists a split point where:

- Both the prefix and suffix are sorted

- The maximum of the suffix is <= the minimum of the prefix

- If such a split exists, then after swapping, the entire array will be sorted

Hence, in code, for each test case, first check if the array is already sorted. If yes, output "Yes"

If not, iterate through all possible split points (from 1 to n-1), and for each split:

- Check if the prefix is sorted

- Check if the suffix is sorted

- Check if max(suffix) <= min(prefix)

- If all three conditions are satisfied for any split, output "Yes"

Otherwise, output "No"

Let me test this logic with the sample input:

Test case 1:

n=6

a=[1,1,4,5,1,4]

- Already sorted? No

- Check possible splits:

- Split at 1: prefix=[1], suffix=[1,4,5,1,4]

- prefix is sorted, suffix is not sorted -> doesn't satisfy

- Split at 2: prefix=[1,1], suffix=[4,5,1,4]

- prefix sorted, suffix not sorted -> doesn't satisfy

- Split at 3: prefix=[1,1,4], suffix=[5,1,4]

- prefix sorted, suffix not sorted -> doesn't satisfy

- Split at 4: prefix=[1,1,4,5], suffix=[1,4]

- prefix sorted, suffix sorted

- max(suffix)=4, min(prefix)=1 -> 4 >1 -> doesn't satisfy

- Split at 5: prefix=[1,1,4,5,1], suffix=[4]

- prefix not sorted, suffix sorted -> doesn't satisfy

- Hence, "No"

Test case 2:

n=5

a=[7,9,2,2,3]

- Already sorted? No

- Check possible splits:

- Split at 1: prefix=[7], suffix=[9,2,2,3]

- prefix sorted, suffix not sorted -> doesn't satisfy

- Split at 2: prefix=[7,9], suffix=[2,2,3]

- prefix sorted, suffix sorted

- max(suffix)=3, min(prefix)=7 -> 3 <=7 -> satisfies -> "Yes"

Test case 3:

n=3

a=[1,2,3]

- Already sorted -> "Yes"

Hence, this logic matches the sample output.

Now, let's look at the provided code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The code is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])

if check_all:

print('YES')

else:

for i in range(1, n):

if a[i - 1] > a[i]:

new = a[i:]

check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])

new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])

if check_all_new and new_all:

print('YES')

break

else:

print('NO')

break

So, it first checks if the array is already sorted. If yes, prints "YES"

If not, it iterates through possible split points where a[i-1] > a[i], i.e., where the array is not in order.

For each such split point i, it takes the suffix starting from index i to the end, and checks:

- If all elements in the suffix are <= a[0]

- And if the suffix is sorted

If both conditions are satisfied for any split point, it prints "YES", else "NO"

Wait, but in our earlier logic, we need to check:

- Both prefix and suffix are sorted

- Max of suffix <= min of prefix

In the code, for the split point i, it takes suffix = a[i:], and checks:

- All elements in suffix <= a[0]

- Suffix is sorted

But, in our earlier logic, we need to check:

- Prefix = a[:i] is sorted

- Suffix = a[i:] is sorted

- Max of suffix <= min of prefix

In the code, it only checks:

- Suffix is sorted

- All elements in suffix <= a[0]

Wait, a[0] is the first element of the prefix, which is correct for checking max(suffix) <= min(prefix), assuming prefix is sorted.

But, in the code, it only checks that all elements in suffix <= a[0], which is equivalent to max(suffix) <= a[0]

But, in our earlier logic, it should be max(suffix) <= min(prefix), which is a[0] in this case, assuming prefix is sorted.

Wait, in the prefix, the minimum would be a[0] if prefix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Hence, max(suffix) <= a[0]

So, the code seems to be implementing the correct logic.

But, there is a potential issue.

In the loop:

for i in range(1, n):

if a[i - 1] > a[i]:

new = a[i:]

check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])

new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])

if check_all_new and new_all:

print('YES')

break

else:

print('NO')

break

Wait, in check_all_new, it's checking a[0] >= new[i] for all i in range(len(new))

Which means, a[0] >= all elements in new, which is the suffix.

Which is equivalent to max(suffix) <= a[0], assuming a[0] is the minimum of the prefix if the prefix is sorted.

But, in the condition, it only checks a[i-1] > a[i], which means it only considers split points where the array is not in order.

But, in our earlier logic, we need to check all possible split points, not just those where a[i-1] > a[i]

Wait, but in the code, it's iterating over i from 1 to n, and only performing the check when a[i-1] > a[i]

But, according to our earlier logic, we need to check all possible split points, not just those where a[i-1] > a[i]

Wait, maybe it's optimizing by only considering split points where the array is not in order, but I'm not sure.

Let me consider an example where the array is not sorted, but the split point is where a[i-1] <= a[i]

For example, [1,3,2]

- a[0]=1, a[1]=3, a[1]>a[0], so split at i=1: prefix=[1], suffix=[3,2]

- check if suffix is sorted and max(suffix) <= a[0]

- suffix=[3,2], not sorted -> doesn't satisfy

- split at i=2: a[1]=3 > a[2]=2 -> suffix=[2], which is sorted, and max(suffix)=2 <= a[0]=1? 2 <=1? No -> doesn't satisfy

- Hence, "NO"

But, in reality, [1,3,2] cannot be sorted using these operations.

So, in this case, the code correctly outputs "NO"

Another example: [2,1,3]

- a[0]=2 > a[1]=1 -> split at i=1: suffix=[1,3], which is sorted, and max(suffix)=3 <= a[0]=2? 3 <=2? No

- Hence, "NO"

Which is correct, as we saw earlier that [2,1,3] cannot be sorted using these operations.

Now, consider [1,2,3]

- Already sorted -> "YES"

Another example: [1,3,2,4]

- Not sorted

- Check split points where a[i-1] > a[i], which is i=2

- suffix=[2,4], which is sorted, and max(suffix)=4 <= a[0]=1? 4 <=1? No

- Hence, "NO"

But, in this case, is it possible to sort [1,3,2,4] using these operations?

Let's see:

- Split at i=1: prefix=[1], suffix=[3,2,4], swap to get [3,2,4,1]

- Split at i=2: prefix=[3], suffix=[2,4,1], swap to get [2,4,1,3]

- Split at i=3: prefix=[2,4], suffix=[1,3], swap to get [1,3,2,4]

- Split at i=4: prefix=[1,3,2,4], suffix=[], swap to get [1,3,2,4]

None of these are sorted, so "NO" is correct.

Another example: [4,1,2,3]

- a[0]=4 > a[1]=1 -> split at i=1: suffix=[1,2,3], which is sorted, and max(suffix)=3 <= a[0]=4? Yes -> "YES"

- After swapping, it becomes [1,2,3,4], which is sorted.

Hence, the code seems to be correctly implementing the logic.

But, in the code, it breaks after the first split point where a[i-1] > a[i], and performs the check.

But, according to our earlier logic, we need to check all possible split points, not just the first one where a[i-1] > a[i]

Wait, but in the code, it's iterating through all i from 1 to n, and checking for each i where a[i-1] > a[i]

If any such i satisfies the conditions, it prints "YES" and breaks.

Otherwise, after checking all such i, if none satisfy, it prints "NO"

Hence, it's checking all possible split points where a[i-1] > a[i], which seems sufficient because if the array is to be sorted by splitting into two sorted parts where max(suffix) <= min(prefix), it must be at a point where a[i-1] > a[i], because otherwise, the array is already sorted up to that point.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**
