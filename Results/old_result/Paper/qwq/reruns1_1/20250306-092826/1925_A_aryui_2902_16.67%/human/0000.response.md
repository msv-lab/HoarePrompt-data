Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k. N seems to represent the length of the strings that I need to form, and k is the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to use. For example, if k is 3, I'll be using 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

The task is to create a string s such that all possible strings of length n using those k alphabets appear as a subsequence in s. A subsequence means that I can pick characters from s in order, skipping some characters in between.

The problem also specifies that I should aim for the smallest possible length for s, and if there are multiple options, I can choose any of them.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. For example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence because you can get it by skipping "b" and "d". Similarly, "ade" is also a subsequence.

So, for the given example:

- Test case 1: n=1, k=2

Possible strings: "a", "b"

The provided s is "ab". Both "a" and "b" are subsequences of "ab".

- Test case 2: n=2, k=1

Possible string: "aa"

Provided s is "aa". "aa" is a subsequence of itself.

- Test case 3: n=2, k=2

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

Provided s is "baab".

- "aa" is in "baab" as the 2nd and 4th characters.

- "ab" is in "baab" as the 3rd and 4th characters.

- "ba" is in "baab" as the 1st and 2nd characters.

- "bb" is in "baab" as the 1st and 4th characters.

- Test case 4: n=2, k=3

Possible strings: all combinations of "a", "b", "c" of length 2, which are 9 in total.

Provided s is "abcbac".

Each of the 9 possible strings is shown to be a subsequence of "abcbac".

So, the problem is to generate such a string s for any given n and k, with the smallest possible length.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```python

import collections

from collections import Counter

from collections import defaultdict

import math

from math import log

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

res = func_1()

print(res)

def func_1():

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'

return s[:k] * n

```

Wait, that seems straightforward, but I need to verify if this approach is correct.

So, in func_1(), it reads n and k, takes the first k letters from 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw', and then repeats that string n times.

For example, for n=1, k=2:

s = 'ab' * 1 = 'ab'

Which matches the first test case.

For n=2, k=1:

s = 'a' * 2 = 'aa'

Which matches the second test case.

For n=2, k=2:

s = 'ab' * 2 = 'abab'

But in the sample output, it's 'baab'.

Wait, 'abab' also contains all subsequences:

- "aa": positions 1 and 3

- "ab": positions 1 and 2, or 3 and 4

- "ba": positions 2 and 3

- "bb": positions 2 and 4

So, 'abab' seems valid, but the sample output used 'baab'. Both are valid, and the problem says if multiple answers are possible, any will do.

For n=2, k=3:

s = 'abc' * 2 = 'abcabc'

But the sample output is 'abcbac'.

Both should be valid, but 'abcabc' is longer than necessary.

Wait, is 'abcabc' smaller than 'abcbac'? No, they are both length 6.

But perhaps a smaller length is possible.

Wait, in the explanation, 'abcbac' is used, which is also length 6, but the problem mentions to choose the smallest possible length, and if multiple, any will do.

So, is 'abcabc' acceptable? It should be, as it contains all required subsequences.

Wait, let's check:

Possible strings of n=2, k=3:

"aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc"

In 'abcabc':

- "aa": positions 1 and 4

- "ab": positions 1 and 2, or 4 and 5

- "ac": positions 1 and 3, or 4 and 6

- "ba": positions 2 and 4

- "bb": positions 2 and 5

- "bc": positions 2 and 3, or 5 and 6

- "ca": positions 3 and 4

- "cb": positions 3 and 5, or 6 and 5 (wait, positions should be increasing, so maybe not)

- "cc": positions 3 and 6

Wait, for "cb", positions 3 and 5 in 'abcabc' are 'c' and 'b', which are in order.

Similarly, "ca" is positions 3 and 4: 'c' and 'a'.

So, 'abcabc' seems to contain all required subsequences.

Therefore, the approach in the code seems correct for the sample inputs.

But is this the optimal length? Is there a shorter string that can contain all required subsequences?

For n=2, k=2:

The sample output is 'baab', which is length 4.

Alternatively, 'abba' would also work:

- "aa": positions 1 and 3

- "ab": positions 1 and 2

- "ba": positions 2 and 3

- "bb": positions 3 and 4

So, 'abba' is also valid and of the same length.

Is there a shorter string? Let's try length 3:

- 'aab':

- "aa": positions 1 and 2

- "ab": positions 1 and 3

- "ba": no occurrence, since 'b' always comes after 'a's

- "bb": no occurrence

So, 'aab' doesn't contain all subsequences.

- 'aba':

- "aa": positions 1 and 3

- "ab": positions 1 and 2

- "ba": positions 2 and 3

- "bb": no occurrence

So, missing "bb".

- 'baa':

- "aa": positions 2 and 3

- "ab": no occurrence

- "ba": positions 1 and 2

- "bb": no occurrence

Missing "ab" and "bb".

- 'bba':

- "aa": no occurrence

- "ab": positions 2 and 3

- "ba": positions 1 and 2

- "bb": positions 1 and 2

Wait, "bb" is positions 1 and 2, but that's the same character repeated.

Wait, in "bba", "bb" is positions 1 and 2.

"ba" is positions 1 and 3.

"ab" is positions 2 and 3.

"aa" is not present.

So, missing "aa".

Hence, length 4 is necessary for n=2, k=2.

Similarly, for n=2, k=3, the sample output is length 6.

Is that the smallest possible?

I'm not sure, but in the code, for n=2, k=3, it returns 'abc' * 2 = 'abcabc', which is also length 6.

So, it matches the sample output in length.

Therefore, it seems correct.

But let's think about the general case.

The approach in the code is to take the first k letters and repeat them n times.

So, s = (first k letters) * n.

For n=1, k=2: 'ab' * 1 = 'ab'

For n=2, k=1: 'a' * 2 = 'aa'

For n=2, k=2: 'ab' * 2 = 'abab'

For n=2, k=3: 'abc' * 2 = 'abcabc'

This seems to work for the sample inputs.

But is this the optimal length?

In the first test case, n=1, k=2: 'ab' is minimal.

In the second test case, n=2, k=1: 'aa' is minimal.

In the third test case, n=2, k=2: 'abab' or 'baab' are both minimal at length 4.

In the fourth test case, n=2, k=3: 'abcabc' is length 6, which seems minimal.

So, perhaps this approach achieves the minimal length.

But I need to confirm if this is indeed the minimal length for general n and k.

Let me think about the minimal length required.

What is the minimal length of s such that all possible strings of length n from the first k letters are subsequences of s?

This sounds like a problem related to de Bruijn sequences, but for subsequences instead of substrings.

De Bruijn sequences are used for finding the shortest sequence that contains all possible subsequences of a certain length, but for substrings.

In this case, we're dealing with subsequences, which are different.

For subsequences, the problem is to find the minimal s such that all combinations of length n from the k letters appear as subsequences.

This is similar to the set cover problem, where we want to cover all required subsequences with the smallest possible s.

I recall that for sequences with subsequences, the minimal length can be calculated using combinatorial methods.

In particular, for binary sequences, there are known results about the minimal length required to contain all subsequences of a certain length.

For general k and n, I'm not sure about the minimal length, but perhaps the approach in the code is acceptable.

In the code, s is of length k*n.

For n=1, k=2: length 2

For n=2, k=1: length 2

For n=2, k=2: length 4

For n=2, k=3: length 6

These match the sample outputs.

But is this always the minimal length?

Let me consider n=3, k=2.

According to the code, s = 'ab' * 3 = 'ababab'

But what is the minimal length for this case?

Possible strings: all combinations of 'a' and 'b' of length 3, which are 8 in total.

Is 'ababab' the minimal length to contain all these subsequences?

Let's check:

- "aaa": positions 1,3,5

- "aab": positions 1,3,4

- "aba": positions 1,2,5

- "abb": positions 1,2,4

- "baa": positions 2,3,5

- "bab": positions 2,3,4

- "bba": positions 2,4,5

- "bbb": positions 2,4,6

Seems like all are covered.

Is there a shorter string that can cover all these subsequences?

Suppose I try 'ababa', which is length 5.

- "aaa": positions 1,3,5

- "aab": positions 1,3,4

- "aba": positions 1,2,5

- "abb": positions 1,2,4

- "baa": positions 2,3,5

- "bab": positions 2,3,4

- "bba": positions 2,4,5

- "bbb": positions 2,4,5 (wait, positions 2,4,5 are 'b','a','a', which is "baa", not "bbb")

So, "bbb" is not present in 'ababa'.

Hence, 'ababa' is insufficient.

What about 'ababb'?

- "aaa": no occurrence

- "aab": positions 1,3,4

- "aba": positions 1,2,5

- "abb": positions 1,2,4

- "baa": positions 2,3,5

- "bab": positions 2,3,4

- "bba": positions 2,4,5

- "bbb": positions 2,4,6 (but there is no 6th character)

So, "aaa" and "bbb" are missing.

Hence, 'ababb' is also insufficient.

What about 'ababbb'?

- "aaa": no occurrence

- "aab": positions 1,3,4

- "aba": positions 1,2,5

- "abb": positions 1,2,4; also positions 1,2,6

- "baa": positions 2,3,5

- "bab": positions 2,3,4; also positions 2,3,6

- "bba": positions 2,4,5; also positions 2,4,6

- "bbb": positions 2,4,5; positions 2,4,6; positions 2,5,6; positions 3,4,5; etc.

So, "aaa" is still missing.

It seems challenging to cover "aaa" and "bbb" in a string shorter than 'ababab'.

Hence, 'ababab' might be minimal for n=3, k=2.

Therefore, the approach in the code seems acceptable.

Moreover, in the code, s is constructed as (first k letters) * n, which for k=2, n=3, would be 'ababab', which matches our earlier example.

Hence, it seems correct.

Additionally, the problem allows any minimal s, so as long as it's minimal in length, it's acceptable.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]

**Correctness: True**
