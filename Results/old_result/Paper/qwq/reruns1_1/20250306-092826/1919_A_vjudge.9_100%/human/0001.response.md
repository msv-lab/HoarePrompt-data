Alright, I've got this problem here about Alice and Bob playing a game with their wallets. Each has some coins, and they take turns making moves according to specific rules. The goal is to determine who will win if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep the current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

So, the key points are:

1. Players take turns, Alice starts.

2. In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or keep the current one.

3. After choosing, they must remove one coin from their current wallet, and the wallet can't have zero coins before removal.

4. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

I need to determine, for given 'a' and 'b', who wins if both play optimally.

First, I should think about the base cases.

Case 1: Both have 1 coin.

- Alice's turn: She can choose not to swap. Then a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He must not swap (since swapping would mean swapping an empty wallet, which might not be allowed, but according to the rules, he chooses to not swap. Then removes 1 coin: a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

This matches the first example.

Case 2: a=1, b=4.

- Alice chooses to swap: a=4, b=1.

- Bob chooses to swap: a=1, b=3.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=0, b=3.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=0, b=2.

- Alice chooses to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

This matches the second example.

Looking for a pattern, it seems that the difference between 'a' and 'b' is important.

In the first case, a=1, b=1, difference is 0, which is even. Bob wins.

In the second case, a=1, b=4, difference is 3, which is odd. Alice wins.

Looking at more examples:

- a=5, b=3, difference 2, even, Bob wins.

- a=4, b=5, difference 1, odd, Alice wins.

- a=11, b=9, difference 2, even, Bob wins.

- a=83, b=91, difference 8, even, Bob wins.

- a=1032, b=9307, difference is 8275, odd, Alice wins.

- a=839204, b=7281, difference 831923, odd, Alice wins.

- a=1000000000, b=1000000000, difference 0, even, Bob wins.

- a=53110, b=2024, difference 51086, even, Bob wins.

From these, it seems that if the absolute difference between 'a' and 'b' is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Wait, but in the second case, a=1, b=4, difference=3, which is odd, Alice wins. Similarly, a=4, b=5, difference=1, odd, Alice wins. a=11, b=9, difference=2, even, Bob wins. a=83, b=91, difference=8, even, Bob wins. a=1032, b=9307, difference=8275, odd, Alice wins. a=839204, b=7281, difference=831923, odd, Alice wins. a=1000000000, b=1000000000, difference=0, even, Bob wins.

So, it consistently shows that if the difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

But why is that the case?

Let me try to find a logical explanation.

First, note that the game is symmetric in some way, but the starting player matters.

Let's think in terms of nim-game or game theory where we can find the winning position based on the initial setup.

If the difference is even, Bob wins; else, Alice wins.

Wait, perhaps it's about the parity of the sum or something else.

Wait, the difference being even or odd determines the winner.

Let me consider that the game continues for a number of steps equal to the smallest number of coins, and then something happens.

Wait, perhaps it's about the parity of the minimum of a and b.

Wait, in the first case, a=1, b=1, min=1, which is odd, Bob wins.

In the second case, a=1, b=4, min=1, odd, Alice wins.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, a=5, b=3, min=3, odd, Bob wins.

a=4, b=5, min=4, even, Alice wins.

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent.

Wait, maybe it's about the parity of the difference.

Difference even: Bob wins.

Difference odd: Alice wins.

This seems to hold for all the examples.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

But I need to verify this.

Looking at the program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

It checks if the absolute difference between a and b is even. If yes, Bob wins; else, Alice wins.

This seems to match the observations from the examples.

But is this always true?

Let me try to think of a general strategy.

Suppose a >= b.

If a == b, difference is 0, which is even, Bob wins.

In this case, Alice has to make the first move. She can choose to swap or not.

If she swaps, a becomes b and b becomes a, but since a == b, it doesn't change.

Then she removes one coin, so a = a - 1, b = b.

Now, Bob can choose to swap or not.

If he swaps, it doesn't change anything since a == b - 1.

He removes one coin.

This continues until one of them can't make a move.

But in this symmetric case, it seems Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, leading to Bob winning.

Wait, but this is just an intuition.

I need to think more formally.

Perhaps this is a impartial game, and I can find the nimber or something.

But that might be too complicated.

Alternatively, think recursively about who can force a win.

But with large constraints, it's not feasible to simulate.

Given the time constraints, I need a smarter way.

Looking back, the program provided seems to pass all the test cases.

But to be sure, let me think of another test case.

Suppose a=2, b=2.

Difference is 0, even, Bob wins.

Game progression:

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=1, b=2.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=1, b=1.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Another example: a=2, b=3.

Difference is 1, odd, Alice wins.

Game progression:

- Alice chooses to swap: a=3, b=2.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=2, b=2.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=1, b=2.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=1, b=1.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob chooses to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins. Wait, but according to the program, Alice should win.

Wait, maybe my simulation is wrong.

Let me try again.

a=2, b=3.

Difference is 1, odd, Alice wins.

- Alice chooses to swap: a=3, b=2.

- Bob chooses to swap: a=2, b=3.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=1, b=3.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=1, b=2.

- Alice chooses to swap: a=1, b=1.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Alice chooses to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Yes, in this case, Alice wins, which matches the program's output.

Another test case: a=3, b=3.

Difference is 0, even, Bob wins.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=2, b=3.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=2, b=2.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=1, b=2.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=1, b=1.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Seems correct.

One more: a=3, b=4.

Difference is 1, odd, Alice wins.

- Alice chooses to swap: a=4, b=3.

- Bob chooses to swap: a=3, b=4.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=2, b=4.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=2, b=3.

- Alice chooses to swap: a=2, b=2.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=1, b=2.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=1, b=1.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Alice chooses to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Again, matches the program's logic.

So, it seems that the program is correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider a=1000000000, b=1000000000.

Difference is 0, even, Bob wins.

And in the example, it's given that Bob wins, which matches.

Another case: a=53110, b=2024.

Difference is 51086, even, Bob wins.

Again, matches the example.

Hence, I can conclude that the program is correct.
