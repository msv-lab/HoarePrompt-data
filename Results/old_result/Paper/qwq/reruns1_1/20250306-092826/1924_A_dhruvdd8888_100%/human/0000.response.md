Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. I need to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I have to print one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if s is "abcde", then "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Okay, so the task is to check if every possible combination of length n from the first k alphabets is present as a subsequence in s. If not, return one such missing string.

Let me think about the constraints. n can be from 1 to 26, k from 1 to 26, and m up to 1000. Also, s consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

First, I need to generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets. But generating all possible strings is not efficient because there are k^n possibilities, which can be up to 26^26, which is a huge number, way beyond what can be handled practically.

So, clearly, generating all possible strings and checking each one is not feasible. I need a smarter approach.

Let me think differently. I need to ensure that every possible combination of length n is a subsequence of s. That means, for any sequence of characters from the first k alphabets, no matter the order they appear in s, as long as their relative order is maintained, it should be present.

Wait, but the order is important in subsequences. So, for a given sequence, say "abc", it should appear in s with 'a' coming before 'b' and 'b' before 'c', but not necessarily consecutively.

Given that, I need to make sure that for any possible sequence of length n using the first k alphabets, I can find that sequence in s as a subsequence.

This seems tricky. Is there a way to check this without generating all possible sequences?

Let me consider the properties of s that would ensure that all possible sequences of length n are present as subsequences.

One idea is to look at the number of times each character appears in s. If s has enough repetitions of each character in the required order, it might cover all possible sequences.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about an example.

Take n=2, k=2, s="abba". Possible sequences are "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". I need to check if each of these is a subsequence of "abba".

- "aa": positions could be 1 and 3 (indices starting from 1).

- "ab": positions 1 and 2.

- "ba": positions 3 and 2.

Wait, "ba": 'b' at position 3 and 'a' at position 2. But position 2 comes before position 3, so that's not maintaining the order. So, "ba" is not a subsequence of "abba" in this case.

Wait, but in "abba", "ba" is a subsequence because you can take 'b' at position 2 and 'a' at position 4. Position 2 comes before position 4, so "ba" is a subsequence.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I took 'b' at position 3 and 'a' at position 2, which is invalid because the positions must be in increasing order.

So, for "ba", you can take 'b' at position 2 and 'a' at position 4, which is valid.

So, in this case, all sequences are present.

But according to the example provided, for n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba", the answer is YES, which matches.

Another example: n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb". Possible sequences are "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

- "aa": is "a" at position 1 and "a" at position 1 (but you need distinct positions for multiple characters, so maybe not).

Wait, subsequences can use the same position only once.

So, "aa" would require at least two 'a's at different positions.

In "abb", there is only one 'a', so "aa" is not a subsequence.

Hence, the answer should be NO, and you should print "aa" as one missing sequence.

Which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, since "aa" cannot be formed because there's only one 'a' in s, the answer is NO, and "aa" is printed.

Another example: n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab". Need to check if all possible strings of length 3 using 'a', 'b', 'c' are present as subsequences in s.

Total possible sequences: 3^3 = 27.

To check if all these are present would be time-consuming manually, but presumably, in this test case, the answer is NO, and "ccc" is printed, meaning "ccc" is not a subsequence of s.

Looking at s="aabbccabab", let's check if "ccc" is a subsequence.

Positions of 'c' in s are positions 5 and 6.

To form "ccc", you need three 'c's in order.

But there are only two 'c's in s, so "ccc" cannot be a subsequence.

Hence, the answer is NO, and "ccc" is printed.

From these examples, I can see that if the number of required characters in the sequence exceeds the number available in s, or if their order cannot be matched, then it's not a subsequence.

Now, back to the problem: I need a way to check if all possible sequences of length n using the first k alphabets are present as subsequences in s.

Given the constraints, generating all k^n sequences is not feasible due to time and space limitations.

I need a smarter way to check this.

Let me think about the minimal requirements for s to contain all possible sequences.

One approach could be to ensure that s contains enough repetitions of each character to cover the required sequences.

For example, for n=2 and k=2, s needs to have at least two 'a's and two 'b's to cover sequences like "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

But wait, in the second sample input, n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb", which has one 'a' and two 'b's. It fails to cover "aa" because there's only one 'a'.

Hence, to cover "aa", s needs at least two 'a's.

Similarly, for "bb", it needs at least two 'b's.

So, in general, for a sequence of length n, s needs at least n occurrences of each character in the sequence.

But that might not be sufficient, because the positions need to be in order.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that for each character, there are enough occurrences spaced out appropriately.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I build a graph where nodes represent characters, and edges represent the order in which characters appear in s.

But that might not be directly helpful.

Another idea: consider the problem as finding if s contains all possible sequences of length n from the first k alphabets.

This seems similar to checking if s is a supersequence for all possible sequences of length n from k alphabets.

Given the large number of possible sequences, this is not practical.

I need to find a way to determine if s is missing any sequence.

An alternative approach is to find the minimal string s that contains all possible sequences of length n from the first k alphabets as subsequences.

But even that seems too broad.

Let me consider the complement: find a sequence of length n that is not a subsequence of s.

If I can find one such sequence, then the answer is NO, and I can print that sequence.

If I can't find any such sequence, then the answer is YES.

So, the problem reduces to finding if there exists at least one sequence of length n that is not a subsequence of s.

If such a sequence exists, print NO and that sequence; else, print YES.

Now, how to efficiently find such a sequence without generating all possibilities.

I need an intelligent way to search for a missing sequence.

Let me consider the frequencies of characters in s.

If any character appears less than n times, then any sequence that requires that character more than the available count cannot be a subsequence.

So, for example, if 'a' appears only once in s, then any sequence with more than one 'a' cannot be a subsequence.

Hence, for each character, the minimum number of times it must appear in s is the number of times it appears in the sequence.

But since sequences can have any combination of characters, I need to ensure that s has enough of each character to cover the maximum required by any sequence.

Wait, but sequences can have any combination, so the limiting factor is the character with the fewest occurrences in s.

Wait, no. It's more nuanced.

For example, if n=2, k=2, s="abb", then 'a' appears once and 'b' appears twice.

Here, sequences like "aa" require two 'a's, which are not present, so "aa" is missing.

Hence, if any character appears fewer than n times, and there exists a sequence that requires that character n times, then that sequence is missing.

Hence, if any character appears fewer than n times, the answer is NO, and you can print a sequence consisting of that character repeated n times.

But wait, in the third sample input, n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab", it's said that "ccc" is not a subsequence.

Looking at s, 'c' appears twice, which is less than n=3, so "ccc" is missing.

Hence, the general rule is: for each character, if it appears fewer than n times in s, then a sequence consisting of that character repeated n times is missing.

Hence, in such cases, the answer is NO, and you can print that sequence.

Moreover, if all characters appear at least n times, then perhaps all sequences are present.

Wait, but is that sufficient?

Suppose n=2, k=2, s="abab", which has two 'a's and two 'b's.

Possible sequences:

- "aa": positions 1 and 3.

- "ab": positions 1 and 2.

- "ba": positions 2 and 3.

- "bb": positions 3 and 4.

All are present.

Hence, in this case, the answer is YES.

Another example: n=2, k=3, s="abacbc", which has two 'a's, two 'b's, and one 'c'.

Here, "cc" is missing because 'c' appears only once.

Hence, the answer is NO, and you can print "cc".

Wait, but k=3, so characters are 'a', 'b', 'c'.

Hence, "cc" is a valid sequence.

So, in this case, since 'c' appears only once, "cc" is missing.

Hence, the general rule seems to hold: if any character appears fewer than n times, then a sequence consisting of that character repeated n times is missing.

Hence, in such cases, the answer is NO, and you can print that sequence.

But what if all characters appear at least n times? Does that guarantee that all sequences are present?

Let's consider n=2, k=2, s="abab", as before, which has two 'a's and two 'b's.

All sequences are present, as shown earlier.

Another example: n=2, k=2, s="aabb".

- "aa": positions 1 and 2.

- "ab": positions 1 and 3.

- "ba": positions 2 and 3.

- "bb": positions 3 and 4.

All are present.

Hence, seems to hold.

But what if s="aaab"?

- "aa": positions 1,2; 1,3; 1,4; 2,3; etc.

- "ab": positions 1 and 4, or 2 and 4, etc.

- "ba": positions ? 'b' at position 4, but 'a' before it at positions 1,2,3.

Hence, "ba" is possible.

- "bb": only one 'b', so "bb" is missing.

Wait, but in this case, 'b' appears only once, which is less than n=2.

Hence, according to the earlier rule, since 'b' appears fewer than n times, "bb" is missing, and the answer is NO.

Hence, the rule seems consistent.

Hence, the approach is:

- Count the frequency of each character in s.

- For each character, if its frequency is less than n, then print NO and a sequence consisting of that character repeated n times.

- If all characters have frequency at least n, then print YES.

Wait, but is this sufficient?

In other words, if all characters appear at least n times, does that guarantee that all possible sequences are present as subsequences?

Let me think about a counterexample.

Consider n=2, k=3, s="abac".

Frequencies: 'a':2, 'b':1, 'c':1.

Wait, but according to the earlier rule, since 'b' and 'c' appear only once, which is less than n=2, then sequences "bb", "bc", "cb", "cc" would be missing.

Hence, the answer should be NO, and you can print any of these missing sequences.

But in this case, 'b' and 'c' appear only once, so any sequence requiring more than one 'b' or 'c' is missing.

Hence, the general rule seems to hold.

But what if all characters appear at least n times?

For example, n=2, k=2, s="aabb", as before.

All sequences are present.

Another example: n=2, k=3, s="aaabbbccc".

Each character appears at least three times.

Possible sequences like "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc" are all present as subsequences.

Hence, it seems that if each character appears at least n times, then all sequences are present.

Is this always true?

Wait, let's consider n=2, k=2, s="aabb".

All sequences are present.

Another example: n=2, k=2, s="abba".

Earlier thought was that "ba" is present.

But in this case, "ba" can be formed by positions 2 and 4.

Hence, seems to hold.

Hence, I can conclude that if each character appears at least n times in s, then all possible sequences of length n using the first k alphabets are present as subsequences in s.

Hence, the approach is:

- Count the frequency of each of the first k characters in s.

- If any character has a frequency less than n, then print NO and a sequence consisting of that character repeated n times.

- Otherwise, print YES.

This seems efficient, as it only requires counting the frequency of each character, which can be done in linear time.

Now, looking back at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

from collections import *

from math import *

from heapq import *

import sys

from bisect import *

from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

s = input()

us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))

win = set()

ans = []

ps = 0

for i in s:

if i in us:

win.add(i)

if len(win) == k:

ans.append(i)

ps += 1

win.clear()

if ps >= n:

return print('YES')

print('NO')

for i in us:

if i not in win:

return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))

It seems quite different from what I thought.

Let me try to understand what this code is doing.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calls func_1.

In func_1:

- Read n, k, m.

- Read string s.

- Create a set us containing the first k lowercase letters.

- Initialize an empty set win and an empty list ans and a counter ps=0.

- Iterate through each character i in s:

- If i is in us:

- Add i to win.

- If len(win) == k:

- Append i to ans.

- Increment ps.

- Clear win.

- If ps >= n:

- Print 'YES'.

- Else:

- Print 'NO'.

- For each character i in us:

- If i not in win:

- Print ''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)

Wait, this seems overly complicated and doesn't match my earlier logic.

In my logic, I just need to count the frequency of each character and check if it's at least n.

But in this code, it's maintaining a sliding window of characters, collecting k distinct characters, and then doing something with ans and ps.

I think this code is trying to find sequences where every k characters are present in a sliding window, and then counting how many such windows there are, and checking if ps >= n.

But this seems unrelated to the problem at hand.

Moreover, in the else clause, it's iterating over us and checking if any character is not in win, and then printing a constructed string.

But win is cleared every time len(win) == k, so at the end of the loop, win might be empty or contain some characters.

This seems inconsistent with the approach I thought of.

Let me test this code with the sample inputs.

First sample input:

3

2 2 4

abba

2 2 3

abb

3 3 10

aabbccabab

According to the sample output:

YES

NO

aa

NO

ccc

Now, running the code with these inputs.

First test case: n=2, k=2, m=4, s=abba

us = {'a', 'b'}

win = set()

ans = []

ps = 0

Iterate through s:

i=0, s[0]='a'

- 'a' in us, add to win -> win={'a'}

- len(win) != k=2

i=1, s[1]='b'

- 'b' in us, add to win -> win={'a','b'}

- len(win)==k=2, append 'b' to ans, ps=1, clear win

i=2, s[2]='b'

- 'b' in us, add to win -> win={'b'}

- len(win)!=k=2

i=3, s[3]='a'

- 'a' in us, add to win -> win={'b','a'}

- len(win)==k=2, append 'a' to ans, ps=2, clear win

Now, ps=2 >= n=2, so print 'YES'

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case: n=2, k=2, m=3, s=abb

us={'a','b'}

win=set()

ans=[]

ps=0

i=0, s[0]='a'

- 'a' in us, add to win -> win={'a'}

- len(win)!=k=2

i=1, s[1]='b'

- 'b' in us, add to win -> win={'a','b'}

- len(win)==k=2, append 'b' to ans, ps=1, clear win

i=2, s[2]='b'

- 'b' in us, add to win -> win={'b'}

- len(win)!=k=2

Now, ps=1 < n=2, so print 'NO'

Then, for i in us:

- i='a', 'a' not in win={'b'}, so print ''.join(ans) + 'a' + 'a'*(n-len(ans)-1)

- ans=['b'], n=2, len(ans)=1, so print 'b' + 'a' + 'a'*(2-1-1) = 'ba' + '' = 'ba'

But in the sample output, it's 'aa'

Hence, this doesn't match the sample output.

Wait, perhaps it's printing any missing sequence, and 'ba' is also missing.

But in my earlier analysis, 'ba' is present in s="abb" as positions 2 and 3.

Hence, 'ba' is actually a subsequence.

But according to the sample output, 'aa' is missing.

Hence, the code is incorrectly printing 'ba', which is actually present.

Hence, this code is wrong.

Third test case: n=3, k=3, m=10, s=aabbccabab

us={'a','b','c'}

win=set()

ans=[]

ps=0

Iterate through s:

i=0, s[0]='a'

- 'a' in us, add to win -> win={'a'}

- len(win)!=k=3

i=1, s[1]='a'

- 'a' in us, add to win -> still {'a'}

- len(win)!=k=3

i=2, s[2]='b'

- 'b' in us, add to win -> {'a','b'}

- len(win)!=k=3

i=3, s[3]='b'

- 'b' in us, add to win -> still {'a','b'}

- len(win)!=k=3

i=4, s[4]='c'

- 'c' in us, add to win -> {'a','b','c'}

- len(win)==k=3, append 'c' to ans, ps=1, clear win

i=5, s[5]='c'

- 'c' in us, add to win -> {'c'}

- len(win)!=k=3

i=6, s[6]='a'

- 'a' in us, add to win -> {'c','a'}

- len(win)!=k=3

i=7, s[7]='b'
