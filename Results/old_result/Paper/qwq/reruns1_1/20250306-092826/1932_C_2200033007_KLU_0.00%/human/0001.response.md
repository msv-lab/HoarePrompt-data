Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array `a` of length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and a string `s` of commands, where each command is either 'L' or 'R'. For each command in the string `s`, I need to perform certain operations and output some values based on those operations.

First, I need to understand what exactly needs to be done for each command. The problem says that for each command, I should:

1. Output the remainder of the product of all elements in the current array `a` when divided by `m`.

2. Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array `a`. If it's 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array `a`.

And I have to do this for all `n` commands in the order they appear in the string `s`.

Also, it's important to note that after each command, the array `a` decreases by one element, and after processing all commands, the array will be empty.

My task is to write a program that processes these commands in order and outputs the required remainders for each step.

First, I need to think about how to efficiently compute the product of the array elements modulo `m` for each step. Since the array is decreasing in size by one element at each step, either from the left or the right, I need a way to keep track of the product as elements are removed.

One straightforward way is to compute the product of the entire array at the start, then, depending on whether 'L' or 'R' is called, divide the product by the element being removed and recompute the product modulo `m`. However, division in modular arithmetic is not straightforward, especially if the modulo `m` is not a prime number. So, this approach might not work reliably.

Another approach is to compute the product incrementally as elements are removed. But again, removing elements from the left or right and keeping track of the product seems tricky.

Let me think differently. Since all commands are known in advance, I can determine the sequence in which elements will be removed. Specifically, I can simulate the process and keep track of which elements are removed at each step.

Wait, but simulating the entire process step by step for each command would be inefficient if `n` is large, because for each step, I'd have to compute the product of the remaining elements, which could be up to O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case. Given that `n` can be up to 2*10^5, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way to compute the product modulo `m` at each step without recomputing it from scratch every time.

Let me consider the order of operations. The commands are processed one by one, and after each command, an element is removed from either the left or the right. So, the array is being reduced step by step until it's empty.

I need to output the product of the current array modulo `m` before each removal.

If I think about the sequence of removals, I can determine which elements are present at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can process the commands in reverse. If I know the final state (which is an empty array), I can work backwards, adding elements according to the reverse of the command sequence, and keep track of the product as I go.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have the sequence of commands: s = s1 s2 ... sn

At each step i from 1 to n:

- Output product(a_i) % m

- Remove the leftmost element if s_i == 'L', or the rightmost if s_i == 'R'

Instead of processing forward, maybe I can process backward, building the array and computing the product accordingly.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 4, m = 6

a = [3, 1, 4, 2]

s = "LRRL"

Processing forward:

1. Command 'L': remove 3, product before removal: 3*1*4*2 = 24, 24 % 6 = 0

2. Command 'R': remove 2, array now [1,4], product:1*4=4, 4 % 6 = 4

3. Command 'R': remove 4, array now [1], product:1, 1 % 6 = 1

4. Command 'L': remove 1, array empty

So outputs: 0, 4, 1

But in the example output, it's: 0, 2, 4, 1

Wait, seems like I miscounted.

Wait, no, in the example output, it's indeed "0 2 4 1"

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let's recalculate:

Initial array: [3,1,4,2]

Command 'L': remove 3, product before removal: 3*1*4*2=24, 24 % 6 = 0

Array now: [1,4,2]

Command 'R': remove 2, product before removal:1*4*2=8, 8 % 6 = 2

Array now: [1,4]

Command 'R': remove 4, product before removal:1*4=4, 4 % 6 = 4

Array now: [1]

Command 'L': remove 1, product before removal:1, 1 % 6 =1

Array now: empty

So outputs: 0,2,4,1 as in the example.

Okay, now, thinking about processing backward.

If I reverse the commands, I'd have to add elements to the left or right accordingly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to collect the sequence of removed elements and then compute the products in reverse.

Wait, maybe I can collect the elements that are removed in order and then compute the cumulative product in reverse.

Let me think.

If I process the commands forward, I can collect the sequence of removed elements.

In the first step, 'L' removes the leftmost element, which is a[0].

In the second step, 'R' removes the new rightmost element, which is a[3].

In the third step, 'R' removes the new rightmost element, which is a[2].

In the fourth step, 'L' removes the new leftmost element, which is a[1].

So, the order of removal is: a[0], a[3], a[2], a[1]

Now, if I consider the final array is empty, and I need to build it back up by adding elements according to the reverse of the removal sequence.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inclusion in the product.

At each step, the product is the product of the elements that are still in the array.

So, initially, all elements are included.

After the first removal ('L'), a[0] is removed, so the product is of a[1], a[2], a[3].

After the second removal ('R'), a[3] is removed, so the product is of a[1], a[2].

And so on.

So, the product at each step is the product of the elements that haven't been removed yet.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products.

Let me consider computing the prefix products and suffix products.

Define prefix[i] = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i-1]

Define suffix[i] = a[i] * a[i+1] * ... * a[n-1]

Then, at any point, the product of the current array is prefix[l] * suffix[r+1], where l is the current left index and r is the current right index.

Wait, actually, that might not directly help, because l and r are changing based on the commands.

Wait, perhaps I need to keep track of the current left and right indices and compute the product as the product of a[l] to a[r].

But computing the product from a[l] to a[r] efficiently is tricky, especially since m can be as large as 10^4 and a[i] up to 10^4, so products can be very large and I need to take modulo m.

Wait, but m can be up to 10^4, which is manageable.

But even better, perhaps I can precompute the product of the entire array and then divide by the removed elements, but division modulo m is not straightforward unless m is prime.

But m can be any positive integer, not necessarily prime.

So, that approach might not work reliably.

Another idea: since I need to output the product of the current array modulo m at each step, and then remove an element.

I can think of it as maintaining the product of the current array, and when removing an element, dividing the product by that element (if possible).

But again, division in modular arithmetic requires computing the modular inverse, which exists only if the element and m are coprime.

Since elements can be up to 10^4 and m up to 10^4, and elements can be any positive integers, including those that are not coprime with m, this approach might not always work.

I need a different way.

Let me consider the sequence of products I need to compute.

In the first step, product of all elements.

In the second step, product of all elements except the one removed in the first step.

In the third step, product of all elements except the ones removed in the first and second steps.

And so on, until only one element remains, and finally the array is empty.

So, it's like maintaining a product while removing elements one by one.

If I can keep track of which elements are still in the array, I can compute the product of those elements.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to do this.

Wait, perhaps I can collect the sequence of removed elements and then compute the products incrementally in reverse.

Let me think about processing the commands in reverse.

Suppose I start with an empty array.

Then, I can simulate adding elements according to the reverse of the command sequence.

Wait, perhaps it's possible to rebuild the array step by step in reverse and keep track of the product.

Let me try.

Suppose I have the sequence of commands: s = s1 s2 ... sn

I can reverse the sequence: s' = s_n s_{n-1} ... s1

Now, I can simulate building the array step by step, according to s'.

At each step, if s'_i == 'L', it means that in the original sequence, the last command was 'L', so I need to add an element to the left.

Similarly, if s'_i == 'R', I need to add an element to the right.

Wait, but in the reversed sequence, 'L' in the original sequence corresponds to adding to the right in the reversed process, and 'R' corresponds to adding to the left.

Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Let's consider that in the original sequence, 'L' means remove from the left, so in the reversed process, it would correspond to adding to the right.

Similarly, 'R' in the original sequence means remove from the right, which in the reversed process corresponds to adding to the left.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of a stack or a deque.

Let me consider using a deque to simulate the process.

I can initialize an empty deque.

Then, processing the commands in order:

- For each command 'L', remove from the left.

- For each command 'R', remove from the right.

But I need to output the product of the current array before each removal.

To make this efficient, I need a way to compute the product of the current elements in the deque efficiently.

But maintaining a product of a deque as elements are added or removed from both ends seems tricky.

Wait, but in this problem, the deque starts full and elements are removed from either end.

So, it's actually a decreasing deque.

I need to find a way to compute the product of the current state of the deque at each step.

Another idea: Since the sequence of removals is determined by the string s, I can determine the order in which elements are removed.

Then, I can compute the product of all elements that have not been removed yet.

But this seems similar to what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I can collect the order in which elements are removed and then compute the product of the remaining elements at each step.

But this might still be O(n^2) in the worst case.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the product of the current array is the product of all elements that haven't been removed yet.

So, if I can compute the product of all elements divided by the product of all removed elements so far, that would give me the product of the current array.

But again, division in modular arithmetic is tricky.

Unless m is prime, I can't always compute the modular inverse.

So, that approach might not work.

Wait, but m can be any positive integer, so it's not necessarily prime.

Therefore, I need another way.

Let me consider precomputing the product of all elements and then, for each step, dividing by the removed element, but only if the removed element and m are coprime, i.e., gcd(a_i, m) == 1, in which case I can compute the modular inverse.

But this would require handling cases where gcd(a_i, m) != 1 separately.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me think about the properties of modular arithmetic.

I need to compute the product modulo m at each step.

Since m can be up to 10^4, which is manageable, and n can be up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to handle large products modulo m.

One thing I can do is to compute the product incrementally.

But as the array decreases by one element each time, either from the left or the right, I need a way to keep track of the product as elements are removed.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute prefix and suffix products modulo m.

Define prefix[i] as the product of a[0] to a[i-1] modulo m.

Define suffix[i] as the product of a[i] to a[n-1] modulo m.

Then, at any step, if I know the current left and right indices, I can compute the product of the current array as (prefix[l] * suffix[r]) % m.

Wait, but this might not be accurate because of the way modulo operation works with products.

Specifically, (a * b) % m == (a % m * b % m) % m.

But if I have prefix[l] which is (a[0] * ... * a[l-1]) % m and suffix[r] which is (a[r] * ... * a[n-1]) % m, then their product modulo m would be (prefix[l] * suffix[r]) % m.

But in reality, the product of the current array is a[l] to a[r], which is suffix[l] / suffix[r+1], but in modular arithmetic, division isn't straightforward.

This seems like a dead end.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the current array as suffix[l] * prefix[r+1], but again, this suffers from the same issue.

I need another approach.

Let me consider that the product of the current array is the product of all elements that haven't been removed yet.

So, if I can compute the product of all elements divided by the product of all removed elements, and take modulo m, but again, division is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all removed elements and then compute the product of the current array as the product of all elements divided by the product of removed elements so far.

But this division issue persists.

I need to find a way around this.

Let me consider that for each step, I can compute the product of the current array by keeping track of the product of elements that remain.

But as elements are removed from either end, it's not straightforward to maintain this product efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can process the commands in reverse, building up the array and computing the product incrementally.

Let me try this.

Suppose I start with an empty array and initialize the product as 1.

Then, for each command in reverse:

- If the command is 'L', it corresponds to adding an element to the left in the original sequence.

- If the command is 'R', it corresponds to adding an element to the right in the original sequence.

Wait, actually, in the reversed process, 'L' in the original sequence means removing from the left, so in the reversed process, it's adding to the right.

Similarly, 'R' in the original sequence means removing from the right, so in the reversed process, it's adding to the left.

This is getting a bit confusing.

Let me try to formalize it.

Define a deque to simulate the array.

Start with an empty deque.

Then, for each command in the original sequence s, but processed in reverse:

- If s[i] == 'L', which means in the original process, it was removing from the left, so in the reversed process, I should add to the right.

- If s[i] == 'R', which means in the original process, it was removing from the right, so in the reversed process, I should add to the left.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of a stack.

Alternatively, perhaps I can collect the sequence of removed elements and then compute the products based on which elements are still present.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion isn't the way to go.

Let me consider that at each step, I have a set of elements that are still in the array.

I can keep track of which elements are removed at each step and maintain a list of current elements.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need something more efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that elements are removed from either end.

So, at each step, the remaining array is a subarray that is contiguous.

Therefore, I can keep track of the left and right boundaries and compute the product within those boundaries.

But computing the product within arbitrary subarrays efficiently requires precomputing prefix products, but again, with modulo m, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute prefix products modulo m and suffix products modulo m.

Then, for a subarray from l to r, the product would be (prefix[r+1] * suffix[l]) % m.

But I need to verify if this is correct.

Wait, prefix[r+1] is the product of a[0] to a[r], and suffix[l] is the product of a[l] to a[n-1].

So, prefix[r+1] * suffix[l] would be the product of a[0] to a[r] multiplied by the product of a[l] to a[n-1], which is not exactly the product of a[l] to a[r] unless l == r+1.

Wait, no.

Actually, if l <= r, then prefix[r+1] is a[0]*...*a[r], and suffix[l] is a[l]*...*a[n-1].

So, prefix[r+1] * suffix[l] = a[0]*...*a[r] * a[l]*...*a[n-1].

This would include a[0] to a[r] and a[l] to a[n-1].

If l <= r, then a[l] to a[r] are included twice.

Wait, no, that's not helpful.

I need to find a way to compute the product from a[l] to a[r] efficiently.

Perhaps I need to precompute prefix products without modulo, and then take modulo m when computing the product for a subarray.

But a[l] to a[r], their product can be prefix[r] / prefix[l-1], but again, division is tricky.

Wait, but in integer division, this might not be accurate.

Moreover, m is up to 10^4, and a[i] up to 10^4, so products can be very large.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for each step, I need the product of the current array modulo m.

As the array is being reduced by removing elements from either end, perhaps I can maintain a product variable and update it accordingly.

Wait, specifically:

- Start with product = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[n-1] modulo m.

- Output product.

- Then, for each command:

- If 'L', remove a[l], update product = product / a[l] modulo m.

- If 'R', remove a[r], update product = product / a[r] modulo m.

- Output the new product.

But again, division modulo m is problematic unless m is prime or a[i] and m are coprime.

So, this approach isn't reliable.

I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that since m can be up to 10^4 and n can be up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) solution.

Perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements and then, for each step, divide by the removed element using modular inverse if possible.

But as I said earlier, m isn't necessarily prime, so computing modular inverses isn't always possible.

Wait, perhaps I can factor m into its prime factors and handle each prime factor separately using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems too complicated for this problem, and m can be up to 10^4, which is manageable directly.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me think about the properties of modulo operation.

If I can find a way to compute the product of the current array without directly dividing, that would be better.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product of the current array and update it by dividing by the removed element, but only when the removed element and m are coprime.

For cases where they are not coprime, I need to handle them differently.

But this seems error-prone and complicated.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that since m can be up to 10^4, which is small, and n can be up to 2*10^5, perhaps I can process the commands in reverse and keep track of the product as I add elements back.

Wait, perhaps this is the way to go.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I start with an empty array and a product of 1.

Then, I process the commands in reverse order.

For each command in reverse:

- If the command is 'L' in the original sequence, which corresponds to adding an element to the right in the reversed process.

- If the command is 'R' in the original sequence, which corresponds to adding an element to the left in the reversed process.

Wait, perhaps it's better to collect the sequence of removed elements and then compute the cumulative product in reverse.

Let me try this.

Suppose I collect all the elements that are removed in order: removed = [a1, a2, ..., an]

Then, the product at step i is the product of all elements except a1 to ai.

Wait, yes.

So, the product at step i is the product of the elements that haven't been removed yet.

In other words, it's the product of the entire array divided by the product of the removed elements up to that step.

But again, division is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all removed elements and keep track of it.

But that doesn't directly help.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all removed elements and then compute the product of the remaining elements as the product of all elements divided by the product of removed elements.

But again, division is problematic.

I need another approach.

Let me consider that for each step, I can compute the product of the current array by multiplying the product of the previous step by the reciprocal of the removed element.

But again, this involves division.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product and update it by multiplying by the modular inverse of the removed element when possible.

But as I said earlier, this isn't always possible.

I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that since m is up to 10^4, which is small, and n is up to 2*10^5, perhaps I can compute the product of the current array by iteratively multiplying the elements that are still present.

But this would be O(n^2) time in the worst case, which is too slow.

I need something more efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m, and then for each step, based on which elements are removed, compute the product of the remaining elements using these precomputed values.

But as I saw earlier, it's not straightforward to compute the product of a subarray using prefix and suffix products modulo m.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in the first step, the product is a[0]*a[1]*
