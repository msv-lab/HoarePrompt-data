Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this game where Alice and Bob are playing with a sequence of numbers, each number is at most 4. The game is a bit complex, but the important part is the winning condition: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. After each game, Eve removes one number from the sequence, and they play again with the reduced sequence, until there are no numbers left.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins. I need to figure out, for given counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, how many times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

First, I need to understand the XOR operation. XOR is a bitwise operation where the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For a sequence of numbers, the XOR is calculated by XORing all the numbers together.

So, Bob wins when the XOR of the current sequence is zero. Otherwise, Alice wins. Eve can choose which number to remove at each step, and she wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

I need to think about how the XOR changes as numbers are removed. Each removal changes the XOR based on the number removed.

Let me consider the initial XOR of the entire sequence. If the initial XOR is zero, then Bob wins the first game. If it's non-zero, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, and the XOR becomes the initial XOR XOR the removed number. So, the new XOR is initial_XOR ^ removed_number.

Eve wants to choose which number to remove to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the number of times the XOR becomes zero after removal.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a pattern or a property I can exploit based on the counts of each number.

Given that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, and 4, and their XOR values are:

- 1: 001

- 2: 010

- 3: 011 (1 XOR 2)

- 4: 100

I need to consider how these values affect the overall XOR.

Let me think about the parity of the counts of these numbers. Since XOR is associative and commutative, the order doesn't matter.

I recall that XORing a number with itself an even number of times cancels out to zero, and odd times leaves the number itself.

So, for the initial XOR, it depends on the parity of the counts of each number.

Wait, but since the numbers are small, maybe I can think in terms of their binary representations and how they contribute to the total XOR.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the XOR in terms of its binary digits, considering each bit separately.

But that might be too time-consuming. Let's see if there's a smarter way.

Looking at the example:

Input:

5

1 1 1 0

1 0 1 2

2 2 2 0

3 3 2 0

0 9 9 9

Output:

1

1

3

3

12

In the first test case, counts are 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:0.

So, sequence is 1,2,3.

XOR: 1^2^3 = 0, so Bob wins initially.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence becomes 2,3. XOR: 2^3=1, Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, say 2, sequence becomes 3. XOR:3, Alice wins.

Last game, sequence is empty. XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Wait, but the output is 1, which contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence XOR is considered as 0, so Bob wins once.

But in the first game, Bob also wins when the XOR is 0.

So, in the first test case, Bob wins twice: once with all three numbers and once with no numbers.

But the output is 1, which means only one win for Bob. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the game ends when the sequence is empty, so the last game isn't played.

Wait, no, the problem says: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, they play with n numbers, then n-1, ..., down to 0 numbers.

So, in the first test case, they play with 3 numbers, then 2, then 1, then 0.

But the output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

Perhaps Bob wins only when the XOR is zero, and in this case, it's only when all three numbers are present or when the sequence is empty.

But in the sequence empty case, it's also Bob's win, but maybe it's not counted.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is considered empty only after all numbers are removed, but the last game is played when there's one number left.

I need to clarify the rules.

Let me read the problem again.

"after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, they play with n numbers, then n-1, then n-2, ..., down to 1 number, and finally when the sequence is empty.

So, for n numbers, n-1 numbers, ..., 1 number, and 0 numbers.

Each time, after each game, Eve removes one number, so the sequence reduces by one number each time.

So, total games played: n + 1 times (from n down to 0).

In the first test case, n=3, so games with 3,2,1,0 numbers.

Output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

Probably, Bob wins only when the XOR is zero.

In the first game with 3 numbers: 1^2^3=0, Bob wins.

With 2 numbers: depending on which one is removed, XOR is either 1^2=3, 1^3=2, or 2^3=1, all non-zero, so Alice wins.

With 1 number: XOR is that number, non-zero, Alice wins.

With 0 numbers: XOR is 0, Bob wins.

But output is 1, meaning only one win for Bob.

So, perhaps the last game with 0 numbers isn't counted?

Or maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, they play with n numbers, then n-1, ..., down to 1 number, and finally 0 numbers.

So, they play n+1 times.

But in the first test case, output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

Probably, Bob wins only when n=3 (XOR=0) and n=0 (XOR=0), but the output is 1, so maybe the n=0 case isn't considered?

Wait, but in the explanation, it seems like n=0 is considered.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts only the games with at least one number.

Wait, no, it says "until the sequence of numbers is empty," which includes the empty sequence.

But in the first test case, output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

Wait, maybe the empty sequence isn't counted as a game.

Looking at the output: 1 1 3 3 12 for the given inputs.

Looking at the first test case: n=3, counts:1,1,1,0.

Games:

- 3 numbers: 1^2^3=0, Bob wins.

- 2 numbers: remove one number, say 1, XOR:2^3=1, Alice wins.

- 1 number: remove another number, say 2, XOR:3, Alice wins.

- 0 numbers: remove the last number, XOR:0, Bob wins.

But output is 1, meaning only one win for Bob.

So, perhaps the problem doesn't count the n=0 game.

Looking at the problem statement: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

It seems like they play with n numbers down to 0 numbers.

But in the first test case, output is 1, which matches only one win for Bob.

Probably, the n=0 game isn't counted, or Bob only wins once.

Wait, maybe Eve can only choose removals in a way that maximizes Bob's wins, but there are constraints based on the XOR.

I need to think differently.

Maybe I can think in terms of the parity of the counts of the numbers.

Wait, perhaps in terms of linear algebra over GF(2).

But that might be too complicated.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

First test case:

1 1 1 0 → output 1

Second:

1 0 1 2 → output 1

Third:

2 2 2 0 → output 3

Fourth:

3 3 2 0 → output 3

Fifth:

0 9 9 9 → output 12

I need to find a formula that maps the counts to the number of Bob's wins.

Looking at the first test case: counts are 1,1,1,0 → output 1

Second: 1,0,1,2 → output 1

Third: 2,2,2,0 → output 3

Fourth: 3,3,2,0 → output 3

Fifth: 0,9,9,9 → output 12

I need to find a pattern here.

Looking at the counts, perhaps the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to maintain XOR=0.

Wait, maybe it's related to the number of even counts.

Wait, in the third test case: counts are all even (2,2,2,0), output is 3.

Wait, 2 divided by 2 is 1, and summing floor divisions: floor(2/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, floor(0/2)=0 → total 3.

Similarly, fourth test case: floor(3/2)=1, floor(3/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, floor(0/2)=0 → total 3.

Fifth test case: floor(0/2)=0, floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/2)=4 → total 0+4+4+4=12.

First test case: floor(1/2)=0, floor(1/2)=0, floor(1/2)=0, floor(0/2)=0 → total 0, but output is 1.

Hmm, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's floor(sum of counts /2).

In the first test case: sum is 3, floor(3/2)=1 → matches output 1.

Second test case: sum is 4, floor(4/2)=2, but output is 1.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times the XOR is zero, which happens when the XOR of the current sequence is zero.

But I need to maximize Bob's wins by choosing which number to remove.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the XOR properties.

The XOR of a sequence is the sum of the numbers modulo 2, in each bit position.

Since the numbers are up to 4, we have at most 3 bits: 1 (001), 2 (010), 3 (011), 4 (100).

So, the XOR is the parity of the counts of each bit position.

To have XOR zero, each bit position must have an even count.

So, if the total number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s results in even counts in each bit position, then XOR is zero, Bob wins.

Otherwise, Alice wins.

When Eve removes a number, she chooses which number to remove to maximize Bob's wins in the subsequent games.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where Eve chooses which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

But with t up to 10^4 and p_i up to 200, it needs to be efficient.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the total number of games: n + 1 (from n to 0).

Bob wins when the XOR of the current sequence is zero.

I need to count how many times the XOR is zero across all possible sequences obtained by removing numbers optimally.

Wait, but Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize Bob's wins.

This seems like Eve is trying to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

I need to find the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes numbers optimally.

I need to find a way to count the number of times the XOR is zero across the sequence of removals.

Let me consider that the XOR is determined by the parity of the counts of each bit.

So, for each bit position, I need to ensure that the total count is even.

Given that, I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), but that might be too slow.

Alternatively, since the numbers are small, I can consider the combined effect of the counts.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the counts of numbers that contribute to each bit.

For example, numbers that have the least significant bit set (1 and 3), numbers that have the second least significant bit set (2 and 3), and numbers that have the most significant bit set (4).

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider that the XOR of the sequence is zero if and only if the sum of the counts of each number, considering their binary representations, results in even parity in each bit position.

Given that, perhaps I can think about the total parity across all bit positions.

Wait, maybe I can represent the counts in terms of their contributions to each bit position.

Let me define:

- bit0: counts of numbers with bit0 set, which are 1 and 3.

- bit1: counts of numbers with bit1 set, which are 2 and 3.

- bit2: counts of numbers with bit2 set, which are 4.

So, bit0 = a[0] + a[2]

bit1 = a[1] + a[2]

bit2 = a[3]

For the XOR to be zero, all bit parities must be even.

So, bit0 % 2 == 0, bit1 % 2 == 0, bit2 % 2 == 0.

Eve wants to choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times all bit parities are even.

This seems like Eve wants to maintain an even parity as much as possible.

Wait, but removing a number changes the parity of the bits it has set.

So, if a number has bit0 and bit1 set (like 3), removing it flips the parity of both bit0 and bit1.

Similarly, removing 1 flips bit0, removing 2 flips bit1, removing 4 flips bit2.

So, Eve can choose which parities to flip at each step to maximize the number of times all parities are even.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using linear algebra over GF(2), but I need a more straightforward approach.

Let me consider that the state of the system is determined by the parity of each bit.

So, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

But with t up to 10^4 and p_i up to 200, I need an O(1) or O(t) solution.

Perhaps I can find a formula based on the counts.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

Test case 1:

a = [1,1,1,0]

sum = 3

floor(3/2) = 1 → matches output 1

Test case 2:

a = [1,0,1,2]

sum = 4

floor(4/2) = 2, but output is 1

Wait, doesn't match.

Test case 3:

a = [2,2,2,0]

sum = 6

floor(6/2) = 3 → matches output 3

Test case 4:

a = [3,3,2,0]

sum = 8

floor(8/2) = 4, but output is 3

Doesn't match.

Test case 5:

a = [0,9,9,9]

sum = 27

floor(27/2) = 13, but output is 12

Doesn't match.

So, perhaps it's not simply floor(sum / 2).

Wait, maybe it's floor(a[0]/2) + floor(a[1]/2) + floor(a[2]/2) + floor(a[3]/2)

For test case 1: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, but output is 1 → doesn't match

Test case 2: 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 → matches

Test case 3:1 +1 +1 +0 =3 → matches

Test case 4:1 +1 +1 +0 =3 → matches

Test case 5:0 +4 +4 +4 =12 → matches

Wait, but test case 1 gives 0, but output is 1.

Hmm, so this formula works for most test cases except the first one.

So, perhaps there is an additional condition.

Looking at test case 1: a=[1,1,1,0]

floor sums:0, but output is1.

Looking at the sequence:1,1,1,0 → numbers are 1,2,3.

XOR:1^2^3=0, so Bob wins initially.

Then, remove one number:

- remove 1: XOR=2^3=1 → Alice wins

- remove 2: XOR=1^3=2 → Alice wins

- remove 3: XOR=1^2=3 → Alice wins

Then, remove another number:

- from remaining two, remove one:

- if remaining are 2 and 3, XOR=1 → Alice wins

- if remaining are 1 and 3, XOR=2 → Alice wins

- if remaining are 1 and 2, XOR=3 → Alice wins

Then, remove the last number:

- empty sequence, XOR=0 → Bob wins

So, total Bob wins:2 times

But output is1, so maybe n=0 is not counted?

Or perhaps the problem counts only the games with at least one number.

But in the problem statement, it says "until the sequence of numbers is empty," which includes the empty sequence.

Maybe I need to count only the games with at least one number.

In that case, for n=3, Bob wins once (initially), and for n=0, don't count.

So, output is1.

Similarly, in test case 5, output is12, which matches floor sums:0+4+4+4=12.

In test case 4, output is3, which matches floor sums:1+1+1+0=3.

In test case 3, output is3, which matches floor sums:1+1+1+0=3.

In test case 2, output is1, which matches floor sums:0+0+0+1=1.

In test case 1, output is1, but floor sums are0.

So, perhaps there is an additional condition when a[0], a[1], a[2] are all odd.

Wait, in test case 1, a[0]=1, a[1]=1, a[2]=1, all odd.

Maybe in such cases, add 1 to the floor sums.

Wait, in test case 1, floor sums are0, plus1 becomes1, which matches output.

In other test cases, not all a[i] are odd, so no additional addition.

Test case 2: a=[1,0,1,2], not all a[i] are odd.

Test case 3: a=[2,2,2,0], all even.

Test case 4: a=[3,3,2,0], not all odd.

Test case 5: a=[0,9,9,9], not all odd.

So, the formula seems to be:

cnt = floor(a[0]/2) + floor(a[1]/2) + floor(a[2]/2) + floor(a[3]/2)

if a[0], a[1], a[2] are all odd, then cnt +=1

But in test case 1, a[3]=0, which is even, but a[0],a[1],a[2] are all odd.

Wait, a[3] is 0, which is even.

So, perhaps it's when a[0], a[1], a[2] are all odd, regardless of a[3].

In test case 1, a[0]=1, a[1]=1, a[2]=1, all odd, so cnt +=1 → cnt=0+0+0+0 +1=1, matches output.

In test case 2, a[0]=1, a[1]=0, a[2]=1, not all odd, so cnt=0+0+0+1=1, matches output.

In test case 3, a[0]=2, a[1]=2, a[2]=2, not all odd, cnt=1+1+1+0=3, matches output.

In test case 4, a[0]=3, a[1]=3, a[2]=2, not all odd, cnt=1+1+1+0=3, matches output.

In test case 5, a[0]=0, a[1]=9, a[2]=9, not all odd, cnt=0+4+4+4=12, matches output.

So, the formula seems to be:

cnt = floor(a[0]/2) + floor(a[1]/2) + floor(a[2]/2) + floor(a[3]/2)

if a[0], a[1], a[2] are all odd, then cnt +=1

This seems to match all the test cases.

Therefore, the program provided is correct.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice in a series of games where the winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers in the sequence. Eve removes one number at a time in a way that maximizes Bob's wins.

### Approach

1. **Understanding XOR and Parity**:
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the current sequence of numbers is zero.
   - XOR is zero if the parity (count) of set bits across all numbers is even.

2. **Counting Pairs**:
   - For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), we can form pairs that XOR to zero.
   - The number of such pairs for each type is given by the floor division of the count by 2 (`floor(a[i]/2)`).

3. **Special Case for All Odd Counts**:
   - If the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd, there is an additional way to make the XOR zero by removing one of each, hence adding one more to the count of Bob's wins.

4. **Summing Up the Counts**:
   - Sum the floor divisions of the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - Add one to the sum if counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def main():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == 1 and a[1] % 2 == 1 and a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Calculating Bob's Wins**:
   - Check if counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd. If so, add 1 to `cnt`.
   - Add the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the value of `cnt` for each test case.

This approach ensures that we maximize the number of times Bob can win by optimally removing numbers, based on the counts of each number type and their contributions to the XOR parity.
