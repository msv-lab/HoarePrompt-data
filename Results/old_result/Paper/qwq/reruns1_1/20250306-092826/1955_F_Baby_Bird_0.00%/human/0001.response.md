Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have a sequence of n integers, each integer is at most 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve is the judge who removes one number at a time from the sequence, and after each removal, they play again with the remaining numbers. This continues until the sequence is empty. Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, I need to find out, for a given initial sequence described by the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4, how many times Bob can win if Eve plays optimally.

First, I need to understand the XOR operation. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order doesn't matter. So, the XOR of a sequence is just the XOR of all its elements.

Given that all numbers are at most 4, the possible numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's see their binary representations:

- 1: 01

- 2: 10

- 3: 11

- 4: 100

Since XOR is bitwise, and the highest bit is 100 (4), we need to consider up to 3 bits.

Wait, actually, 4 is 100 in binary, which is 4 in decimal. So, the bits we need to consider are bits 0, 1, and 2 (from the right).

But, since 1 is 01 (binary), 2 is 10, 3 is 11, and 4 is 100, I need to see how their XORs combine.

But maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Given that each number is small, and their counts are given, I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), but that might be too complicated for this problem.

Alternatively, since the numbers are small, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula based on the counts of each number.

Let me consider the properties of XOR:

- XOR of two identical numbers is 0.

- XOR is associative and commutative.

- XOR of a sequence is the bitwise XOR of all elements.

Given that, perhaps I can find the overall XOR of the sequence and see how removing elements affects it.

But Eve is removing elements one by one, and after each removal, we check the XOR of the remaining sequence.

Wait, no. Actually, in each step, Eve removes one number, and then Alice and Bob play with the remaining sequence. So, for each removal, we have a new sequence, and we need to check if the XOR of that new sequence is zero or not.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, which means she wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

So, Eve wants to choose which number to remove at each step such that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can think in terms of the total number of times Bob can win, given optimal play by Eve.

Let me consider the initial sequence with n numbers. Then Eve removes one number, leaving n-1 numbers, then removes another, leaving n-2, and so on, until the sequence is empty.

So, there are n games in total: one for each possible number of removals, from 0 to n-1.

Wait, no. Actually, Eve removes numbers one by one, and after each removal, they play with the remaining sequence. So, they play n times: once with the full sequence, once with one number removed, once with two numbers removed, and so on, until only one number remains, and finally when the sequence is empty.

Wait, but the problem says: "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it's n games in total: with n numbers, n-1 numbers, n-2 numbers, ..., 1 number, and finally 0 numbers.

But, in each game, the sequence is the current sequence after removing some numbers.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

I need to find, for each test case, the maximum number of times Bob can win, i.e., the maximum number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero, given that Eve removes numbers optimally.

Now, to approach this, perhaps I need to find, for each possible subset of the sequence, if its XOR is zero.

But that seems too time-consuming, especially since n can be up to the sum of p_i, which can be up to 200*4 = 800 per test case, and t can be up to 10^4.

Wait, but the input is given as counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, for each test case, I have p0, p1, p2, p3 representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

Wait, no, the problem says: "the first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game."

So, p0 is the number of 1's, p1 is the number of 2's, p2 is the number of 3's, and p3 is the number of 4's.

Wait, actually, looking back: "the first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game."

Wait, it's p_i for i from 0 to 3, where p0 is the number of 1's, p1 is the number of 2's, p2 is the number of 3's, and p3 is the number of 4's.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement: "the first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game."

So, p0 is the number of 1's, p1 is the number of 2's, p2 is the number of 3's, and p3 is the number of 4's.

But in the sample input:

5

1 1 1 0

1 0 1 2

2 2 2 0

3 3 2 0

0 9 9 9

So, for the first test case, there is one 1, one 2, one 3, and zero 4's.

Wait, but the problem mentions p_i as the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours, but in the sample input, it's p0 p1 p2 p3, corresponding to ones, twos, threes, and fours.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it's "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours", so p0 is ones, p1 is twos, p2 is threes, p3 is fours.

Wait, but in programming, indices usually start at 0, but in math, sometimes indices start at 1. Anyway, here p_i seems to be p0, p1, p2, p3 corresponding to 1,2,3,4.

But in programming, if I read them as p = [p0, p1, p2, p3], where p0 is ones, p1 is twos, etc.

But in the code provided, it's:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))

print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)

So, it's reading p_i's, and for each p_i, it's setting p_i to p_i - p_i % 2, which makes p_i even.

Then, it prints sum of p_i's divided by 2 plus 1 if the number of odd p_i's in p0, p1, p2 is 3.

Wait, but p_i's are made even by subtracting p_i % 2.

So, p_i becomes p_i - p_i % 2, which means if p_i was even, it remains the same; if odd, it becomes even by subtracting 1.

Then, it sums p_i's and divides by 2.

Also, it checks if the number of p_i's in p0, p1, p2 that are odd is equal to 3, and adds 1 if that's the case.

Wait, but p_i's have already been made even except perhaps for p3.

Wait, no, p3 is also made even.

Wait, but in the expression sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3, it's checking if the number of p0, p1, p2 that are odd is 3.

But since p_i's have been set to p_i - p_i % 2, which makes them even, their % 2 would be 0.

Wait, but in the code, p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split())), so p_i's are made even.

Then, sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3 checks if the number of p0, p1, p2 that are odd is 3.

But since p_i's are made even, x % 2 > 0 would be False for all p_i's in p0, p1, p2, so sum would be 0, and 0 == 3 is False, so it adds 0.

Then, it adds sum(p) // 2.

Wait, but in the sample input:

1 1 1 0

After making them even: p0=0, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0

sum(p) // 2 = 0

sum(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])) == 3 is False, so adds 0

Total is 0, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.

Wait, let's see:

p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))

So, for input 1 1 1 0:

p0 = 1 - 1 % 2 = 1 - 1 = 0

p1 = 1 - 1 % 2 = 0

p2 = 1 - 1 % 2 = 0

p3 = 0 - 0 % 2 = 0

Then, sum(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])) == 3

p[:3] = [0,0,0]

x % 2 > 0 for each is False, so sum is 0, 0 == 3 is False, so adds 0

sum(p) // 2 = 0 // 2 = 0

Total is 0 + 0 = 0, but sample output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)

So, (sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) is a boolean, which is False, which is 0, then adds sum(p)//2, which is 0, so total 0.

But sample output is 1, so this is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I misread the operator.

In Python, == has lower precedence than +, but in this case, it's grouped correctly.

Wait, no, actually, in Python, == is a comparison, and + is addition, so (condition) + sum(p)//2.

But in this case, condition is False, which is 0, plus 0, which is 0, but sample output is 1, so it's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be sum(p[:3]) % 2 == 1 or something.

I think there's a mistake in the code.

Let me try to think differently.

I need to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Given that Eve removes numbers one by one, and after each removal, the sequence changes, I need to find, for each step, whether Eve can choose a number to remove such that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Wait, but actually, Eve chooses which number to remove at each step, and she wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

So, Eve wants to choose removals such that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.

This sounds like Eve wants to choose, at each step, a number to remove that makes the XOR of the remaining sequence zero.

But, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step.

So, for each step, from n to 1, she removes one number, and checks if the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

She wants to maximize the number of times this XOR is zero.

This seems like a problem that can be solved by analyzing the XOR properties and the counts of each number.

But, since the numbers are small (only 1,2,3,4), maybe I can represent the sequence as a multiset with counts p0, p1, p2, p3.

Then, the XOR of the entire sequence is XOR of p0*1, p1*2, p2*3, p3*4.

But XOR is associative and commutative, so I can compute the total XOR as 1 XOR 1 XOR ... (p0 times) XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR ... (p1 times) and so on.

But, since XOR of a number with itself is zero, and XOR is linear, I can simplify this.

Wait, more precisely, XOR of a number an even number of times is zero, and odd number of times is the number itself.

So, the total XOR is XOR of all numbers, each appearing p_i times.

Which is XOR of (1 if p0 is odd) XOR (2 if p1 is odd) XOR (3 if p2 is odd) XOR (4 if p3 is odd).

Wait, no. More accurately, XOR of a number p_i times is equal to the number itself if p_i is odd, and zero if p_i is even.

So, the total XOR is XOR of all numbers that appear an odd number of times.

So, in this problem, the initial XOR is XOR of all numbers that have odd counts.

Wait, no, more precisely, for each number, if it appears an odd number of times, include it in the XOR; if even, its contribution is zero.

So, the total XOR is XOR of all numbers that appear an odd number of times.

Now, Eve removes numbers one by one, and after each removal, the XOR changes.

Wait, but in each step, Eve removes one number, and then we check the XOR of the remaining sequence.

So, for each step, from n down to 1, Eve chooses which number to remove, and we check if the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times this happens.

This seems like a problem where I need to consider the XOR of the sequence after each removal.

But, since XOR is involved, and the sequence is being modified by removing one number at a time, it's a bit tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of the total number of subsets with XOR zero.

But, in this problem, it's not about subsets; it's about the sequence after removing certain elements in a specific order.

Wait, but Eve chooses which element to remove at each step.

So, perhaps I can model this as a process where at each step, Eve chooses to remove a number that leads to the remaining sequence having XOR zero.

But, I need to maximize the number of times the remaining sequence has XOR zero.

This seems like a problem that can be solved by counting the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero, given that Eve chooses optimally.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the counts of each number.

Given that the XOR of the sequence is determined by the numbers that appear an odd number of times, perhaps I can keep track of the parity of the counts.

But, as Eve removes numbers one by one, the parities change.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider smaller examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first sample input: 1 1 1 0

So, p0=1 (one 1), p1=1 (one 2), p2=1 (one 3), p3=0 (no 4's)

So, the sequence is [1,2,3]

Total XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0

So, with all three numbers, XOR is 0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining [2,3], XOR is 2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 2, remaining [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Finally, Eve removes the last number, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins twice.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, the games are played at each step, including the full sequence and the empty sequence.

So, steps:

1. n=3: [1,2,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

2. n=2: remove one number, say 1, remaining [2,3], XOR=1, Alice wins.

3. n=1: remove another number, say 2, remaining [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

4. n=0: remove the last number, sequence is empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins at n=3 and n=0.

But the sample output is 1.

Wait, maybe the empty sequence is not considered, or perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, they play with n numbers, n-1 numbers, ..., 1 number, and finally 0 numbers.

So, n+1 games in total.

But in the first sample, n=3, so 4 games: n=3, n=2, n=1, n=0.

In my earlier count, Bob wins at n=3 and n=0.

But sample output is 1, which means Bob wins only once.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence doesn't count as a game where Bob wins.

But in my earlier reasoning, empty sequence has XOR=0, so Bob wins.

Maybe the problem doesn't consider the empty sequence as a game.

But in the problem statement, it says "until the sequence of numbers is empty."

And it says "this continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, including the empty sequence.

But perhaps Bob doesn't win when the sequence is empty.

Wait, according to the rules, if the XOR is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Empty sequence has XOR=0, so Bob wins.

But sample output is 1, which contradicts my earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence doesn't count.

But the problem says "until the sequence of numbers is empty."

Probably, the empty sequence is considered, and Bob wins that game.

But in the first sample, output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sequence of removals.

Let me try different removals.

First, n=3: [1,2,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Eve removes 1, remaining [2,3], XOR=1, Alice wins.

Eve removes 2, remaining [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Eve removes 3, remaining empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence doesn't count.

But the problem says "until the sequence of numbers is empty."

Probably, the empty sequence is considered, and Bob wins once.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps Eve can only choose to remove a number that makes the XOR of the remaining sequence zero.

Wait, no, Eve chooses which number to remove, and after removal, regardless of the XOR, they play with the remaining sequence.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

So, in the first step, with [1,2,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining [2,3], XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes 2, remaining [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then, removes 3, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Total Bob wins: 2, but sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps in the first step, Eve removes a number such that the remaining sequence has XOR zero.

Wait, let's see:

Initial sequence: [1,2,3], XOR=0.

Eve can choose to remove 1, remaining [2,3], XOR=1.

Or remove 2, remaining [1,3], XOR=0.

Or remove 3, remaining [1,2], XOR=3.

So, if Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, she should choose to remove 2, so remaining [1,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, sequence is [1,3], XOR=0.

Eve removes 1, remaining [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then, removes 3, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Total Bob wins: two times.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, maybe the empty sequence doesn't count as a game.

But the problem says "until the sequence of numbers is empty."

Probably, the empty sequence is considered, and Bob wins once.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Eve can only choose to remove a number that makes the XOR of the remaining sequence zero.

Wait, no, Eve chooses which number to remove, and then checks if the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

So, she can choose to remove a number that makes the remaining sequence have XOR zero, but she can also choose otherwise.

In the first step, she can choose to remove 2, making [1,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, with [1,3], she can choose to remove 1, making [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Total Bob wins: two times.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, maybe in the first step, Eve removes 2, making [1,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, with [1,3], she removes 3, making [1], XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then, remove 1, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Again, two times.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, maybe there's a different removal order.

If Eve removes 1 first, making [2,3], XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then, remove 2, making [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Only one Bob win.

So, in this case, Eve can choose removals that result in only one Bob win.

But in my previous approach, I had two Bob wins.

So, Eve can choose differently to maximize Bob's wins or minimize them.

Wait, no, Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins.

So, in the first step, she can choose to remove 2, making [1,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, with [1,3], she can choose to remove 3, making [1], XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then, remove 1, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Total two Bob wins.

Alternatively, she can remove 1 first, making [2,3], XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then, remove 2, making [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Only one Bob win.

So, Eve can choose to maximize Bob's wins to two.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, Eve removes numbers one by one, and after each removal, Alice and Bob play with the remaining sequence.

But, Eve chooses which number to remove at each step.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

In the first sample, with [1,2,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes 2, making [1,3], XOR=0, Bob wins again.

Then, remove 3, making [1], XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then, remove 1, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Total three Bob wins.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence doesn't count.

But the problem says "until the sequence of numbers is empty."

Probably, the empty sequence is considered, but perhaps Bob only wins once.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Eve removes numbers in such a way that the XOR of
