Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has an array of integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and modifying the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1 by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero by applying this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. For any chosen i, the operation affects three consecutive elements: the one before, the one at i, and the one after. Specifically, a[i-1] decreases by 1, a[i] decreases by 2, and a[i+1] decreases by 1. This seems like a localized way to reduce the values in the array.

Given that, I need to find out if it's possible to reduce the entire array to zeros using these operations. Since the operations are only allowed on indices from 2 to n-1, the first and last elements have limited ways to be modified.

Let me think about the implications of this operation. Each operation reduces the sum of the array by 4 (1 + 2 + 1). So, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to reduce it to zero. Wait, but that's not necessarily sufficient, as the operations are constrained in where they can be applied.

Maybe I should look at the differences between consecutive elements. Let's consider the array as a sequence and see if there's a pattern or a way to propagate the operations to affect the entire array.

Another approach is to model this as a system of equations. Each operation corresponds to subtracting a specific vector from the array: [0, ..., 0, -1, -2, -1, 0, ..., 0], where the -1 and -2 are at positions i-1, i, and i+1 respectively.

Given that, I can think of the problem as solving a system where the operations are the variables, and I need to find non-negative integer solutions such that the array becomes zero.

But solving a system of equations for each test case might be too time-consuming, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, with the total sum of n over all test cases being up to 2*10^5.

I need a more efficient way to check for each test case whether it's possible to reduce the array to zero.

Let me consider the operations in reverse. Suppose the array is already zero, and I apply the operations in reverse, which would mean adding 1 to a[i-1], 2 to a[i], and 1 to a[i+1]. If I can build up the given array by such additions, then it's possible to reach zero by reversing those operations.

But that still doesn't give me a direct way to check for possibility.

Maybe I can look at the array as a sequence and see how the operations affect it step by step.

Let's try to simulate the operations. Starting from the beginning of the array, if I have a non-zero element at position 1, I need to find a way to reduce it. However, since operations can only be performed on indices from 2 to n-1, affecting elements from position 1 to n-2, I need to find a sequence of operations that can reduce the first element.

Wait, actually, operations involving i=2 can affect a[1], a[2], and a[3]. So, by applying operations at i=2, I can reduce a[1]. Similarly, operations at higher i can affect later elements.

Perhaps I can process the array from left to right, applying operations to zero out each element starting from the first one.

Let me try that.

Consider the array a = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an].

Start with a1. If a1 > 0, I need to reduce it to zero. To affect a1, I can only use operations with i=2 (which affects a1, a2, a3). Each operation at i=2 will subtract 1 from a1. So, to reduce a1 to zero, I need to perform a1 operations at i=2.

But wait, performing a1 operations at i=2 will subtract a1 from a1, 2*a1 from a2, and a1 from a3. So, after these operations, a1 becomes zero, a2 becomes a2 - 2*a1, and a3 becomes a3 - a1.

Now, move to a2. After the previous step, a2 is now a2 - 2*a1. If this new a2 is greater than zero, I need to reduce it to zero. To affect a2, I can use operations at i=3 (affecting a2, a3, a4). Each operation at i=3 will subtract 2 from a2.

Wait, but operations at i=3 affect a2, a3, and a4. Each operation at i=3 subtracts 1 from a2, 2 from a3, and 1 from a4. So, to reduce a2 to zero, I need to perform operations at i=3 such that a2 - number_of_operations * 1 = 0.

But I already have a2 reduced by 2*a1 from the previous step. So, I need to make sure that after subtracting a1 operations at i=2, and then some operations at i=3, a2 becomes zero.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the differences between consecutive elements.

Define b[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n, assuming a[0] = 0.

Wait, perhaps cumulative sums or prefix sums could be useful here.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a system where each operation affects a specific set of elements, and find if the combination of these operations can lead to the target array (all zeros).

But that might not be efficient given the constraints.

Let me think differently. Suppose I fix the number of operations at each position i (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1). Let’s denote the number of operations at position i as x_i.

Then, the effect on the array would be:

- For each i from 2 to n-1:

a[i-1] -= x_i

a[i] -= 2*x_i

a[i+1] -= x_i

After all operations, we want a[j] = 0 for all j from 1 to n.

So, we can write equations for each a[j]:

- a[1] - x_2 = 0

- a[2] - 2*x_2 - x_3 = 0

- a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3 - x_4 = 0

...

- a[n-1] - x_{n-2} - 2*x_{n-1} - x_n = 0

- a[n] - x_{n-1} - 2*x_n = 0

Wait, but the operations are only defined for i from 2 to n-1, so x_i corresponds to operations at i.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me redefine x_i as the number of operations performed at position i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1).

Then:

- a[1] - x_2 = 0

- a[2] - 2*x_2 - x_3 = 0

- a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3 - x_4 = 0

...

- a[k] - x_{k-1} - 2*x_k - x_{k+1} = 0 for k from 2 to n-1

- a[n] - x_{n-1} - 2*x_n = 0

Wait, but in the operation, for each x_i, it affects a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1].

So, for x_i operations at i:

a[i-1] -= x_i

a[i] -= 2*x_i

a[i+1] -= x_i

So, for the entire array:

For i from 1 to n:

a[i] -= sum of x_j for all j such that the operation at j affects a[i].

Specifically:

- a[1] -= x_2

- a[2] -= 2*x_2 + x_3

- a[3] -= x_2 + 2*x_3 + x_4

...

- a[k] -= x_{k-1} + 2*x_k + x_{k+1} for 2 ≤ k ≤ n-1

- a[n-1] -= x_{n-2} + 2*x_{n-1}

- a[n] -= x_{n-1}

Wait, that seems more accurate.

So, to have a[i] = 0 after operations, we need:

- a[1] - x_2 = 0 => x_2 = a[1]

- a[2] - 2*x_2 - x_3 = 0

- a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3 - x_4 = 0

...

- a[n-1] - x_{n-2} - 2*x_{n-1} - x_n = 0

- a[n] - x_{n-1} - 2*x_n = 0

Now, starting from the first equation: x_2 = a[1]

Then plug x_2 into the second equation: a[2] - 2*a[1] - x_3 = 0 => x_3 = a[2] - 2*a[1]

Then plug x_2 and x_3 into the third equation: a[3] - a[1] - 2*(a[2] - 2*a[1]) - x_4 = 0

Simplify: a[3] - a[1] - 2*a[2] + 4*a[1] - x_4 = 0 => x_4 = a[3] - a[1] - 2*a[2] + 4*a[1] = a[3] - 2*a[2] + 3*a[1]

This seems getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x_i in terms of a_i and previous x_j.

Wait, maybe I can use a recurrence relation.

Let me try to express x_i in terms of a_i and x_{i-1}.

From the equations:

For i from 2 to n-1:

a[i] - 2*x_i - x_{i+1} - x_{i-1} = 0

Wait, perhaps I need to rearrange them differently.

Actually, perhaps I can treat this as a system of linear equations and find a way to solve for x_i sequentially.

Let me try to solve the equations step by step.

Given:

x_2 = a[1]

x_3 = a[2] - 2*x_2 = a[2] - 2*a[1]

x_4 = a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3 = a[3] - a[1] - 2*(a[2] - 2*a[1}) = a[3] - a[1] - 2*a[2] + 4*a[1} = a[3] - 2*a[2] + 3*a[1}

Continuing this way:

x_5 = a[4] - x_3 - 2*x_4 = a[4] - (a[2] - 2*a[1}) - 2*(a[3] - a[1} - 2*a[2} + 4*a[1}) = ...

This is getting too messy. There must be a better way.

Let me consider the array as a whole. Maybe there's an invariant or a property that remains constant after operations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the differences between consecutive elements and see how operations affect those differences.

Let’s define d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n, assuming a[0] = 0.

Now, see how an operation affects d[i].

An operation at i subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

So, d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]

After the operation, d[i] becomes (a[i] - 2) - (a[i-1] - 1) = a[i] - 2 - a[i-1] + 1 = (a[i] - a[i-1]) - 1 = d[i] - 1

Similarly, d[i+1] = a[i+1] - a[i]

After the operation, d[i+1] = (a[i+1] - 1) - (a[i] - 2) = a[i+1] - 1 - a[i] + 2 = (a[i+1] - a[i}) + 1 = d[i+1] + 1

So, each operation at i decreases d[i] by 1 and increases d[i+1] by 1.

That's interesting. So, operations allow me to transfer "deficits" or "surpluses" from one difference to the next.

Given that, perhaps I can adjust the differences step by step to make all d[i] equal to zero, which would mean the array is constant, and since we need to reach all zeros, the constant must be zero.

Wait, but if the array is constant, and we need to reach all zeros, it's only possible if the original array is already all zeros, which is not generally the case.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that operations can be used to propagate changes through the array, affecting the differences in a specific way.

Given that each operation at i decreases d[i] by 1 and increases d[i+1] by 1, it's similar to moving a "deficit" from one difference to the next.

Perhaps I can use this to make all d[i] equal to some value, but in this problem, I need to reach all zeros.

Wait, maybe I should consider the sum of the differences.

The sum of d[i] from 1 to n is a[n] - a[0] = a[n], since a[0] = 0.

But in our case, a[0] is not part of the array, so perhaps this isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at prefix sums.

Let me try to define s[i] = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[i]

Then, see how operations affect s[i].

An operation at i subtracts 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1].

So, for s[j], where j < i-1, s[j] remains unchanged.

For j = i-1, s[j] -= 1

For j = i, s[j] -= 1 + 2 = 3

For j = i+1, s[j] -= 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

For j > i+1, s[j] -= 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

Wait, that doesn't seem helpful.

Maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Let me look back at the example provided.

In the first example:

Original array: [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]

Operations performed:

1. Operation at i=4: a[3] -=1, a[4] -=2, a[5] -=1 => [1,3,4,3,1]

2. Operation at i=3: [1,2,2,2,1]

3. Operation at i=2: [0,0,1,2,1]

4. Operation at i=4: [0,0,0,0,0]

So, it's possible to reduce this array to zeros.

Looking at this, it seems that by choosing operations in a specific sequence, I can zero out the array.

But I need a general method to determine this for any array.

Another idea: perhaps I can model this as a system where each operation corresponds to subtracting a specific vector from the array, and see if the target vector (all zeros) can be reached from the initial array.

Given that, it's a matter of solving a system of linear equations over the integers, but that seems too slow for the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the problem in terms of linear algebra, finding if the initial array is a linear combination of the operation vectors.

But again, with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need something more efficient.

Maybe I can find some invariant or property that must hold for the array to be reducible to zeros.

Let me consider the sum of the array elements.

Each operation reduces the sum by 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

So, for the array to be reducible to zeros, the sum of its elements must be divisible by 4.

But is this sufficient?

Looking back at the first test case: [1,3,5,5,2]

Sum is 1+3+5+5+2 = 16, which is divisible by 4.

Second test case: [2,4,4,5,1], sum is 16, which is divisible by 4, but the answer is "NO", meaning that divisibility by 4 is not sufficient.

So, there must be another condition.

Hence, sum being divisible by 4 is necessary but not sufficient.

I need to find additional conditions.

Looking at the operations again, each operation affects three consecutive elements.

Maybe I can consider the array in segments and see how operations propagate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can process the array from left to right, keeping track of the required operations to zero out each element, and check for consistency.

Let me try that.

Start with a[1].

To zero out a[1], since operations can only affect a[1] through operations at i=2.

Each operation at i=2 subtracts 1 from a[1].

So, to make a[1] zero, I need to perform x_2 = a[1] operations at i=2.

Then, move to a[2].

After performing x_2 operations at i=2, a[2] is reduced by 2*x_2.

So, the new a[2] is a[2] - 2*x_2.

To zero out this new a[2], I can perform x_3 operations at i=3, which will subtract x_3 from a[2].

So, I set x_3 = a[2] - 2*x_2.

Then, move to a[3].

After operations at i=2 and i=3, a[3] is reduced by x_2 + 2*x_3.

So, the new a[3] is a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3.

To zero out this new a[3], I can perform x_4 operations at i=4, which will subtract x_4 from a[3].

So, set x_4 = a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3.

Continue this process until the end of the array.

Finally, for the last two elements, a[n-1] and a[n], ensure that after all operations, they are zero.

This seems like a way to sequentially determine the number of operations at each position and check if it leads to all zeros.

Let me try this approach with the first test case.

Test case 1:

n=5, a=[1,3,5,5,2]

Step 1: x2 = a1 = 1

Step 2: x3 = a2 - 2*x2 = 3 - 2*1 = 1

Step 3: x4 = a3 - x2 - 2*x3 = 5 - 1 - 2*1 = 2

Step 4: x5 = a4 - x3 - 2*x4 = 5 - 1 - 4 = 0

Step 5: Check a5 - x4 - 2*x5 = 2 - 2 - 0 = 0

Since a5 becomes zero, it's possible.

Second test case:

n=5, a=[2,4,4,5,1]

Step 1: x2 = 2

Step 2: x3 = 4 - 4 = 0

Step 3: x4 = 4 - 2 - 0 = 2

Step 4: x5 = 5 - 0 - 4 = 1

Step 5: Check a5 - x4 - 2*x5 = 1 - 2 - 2 = -3, which is not zero.

Hence, "NO".

This seems to align with the sample outputs.

So, this approach seems promising.

Let me formalize it.

Algorithm:

1. Read the number of test cases t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n and the array a of size n.

b. Initialize an array x of size n, where x[i] represents the number of operations at position i+1 (since i starts from 0).

c. Set x[1] = a[0] (operations at i=2)

d. For i from 1 to n-3:

i. x[i+1] = a[i] - 2*x[i] (operations at i+2)

e. Set x[n-1] = a[n-2] - x[n-3] - 2*x[n-2] (operations at n-1)

f. Check if a[n-1] - x[n-2] - 2*x[n-1] == 0

g. If yes, output "YES"; else, "NO"

Wait, I need to adjust the indices.

More precisely:

- x[2] = a[1]

- x[3] = a[2] - 2*x[2]

- x[4] = a[3] - x[2] - 2*x[3]

...

- x[n-1] = a[n-2] - x[n-3] - 2*x[n-2]

- Check if a[n-1] - x[n-2] - x[n-1] == 0

- Check if a[n] - x[n-1] == 0

Wait, the last elements might need special handling.

Actually, in the previous test cases, n=5.

So, for n=5:

x[2] = a[1] = 1

x[3] = a[2] - 2*x[2] = 3 - 2 = 1

x[4] = a[3] - x[2] - 2*x[3] = 5 - 1 - 2 = 2

x[5] = a[4] - x[3] - 2*x[4] = 2 - 1 - 4 = -3

But in the first test case, x5 was set to 0, but according to this, it's -3, which is invalid.

Wait, but in the sample, it's "YES", meaning it's possible, but according to this, x5 is -3, which is negative, invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that all x[i] are non-negative.

In the first test case, x5 is 0, which is okay.

In the second test case, x5 is 1, which is okay, but the final check fails.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that all x[i] are non-negative and that the final elements are zero.

So, in the first test case, x5 is 0, which is okay, and the final check succeeds.

In the second test case, x5 is 1, but the final check fails.

Hence, I need to ensure that all x[i] are non-negative and that the final elements are zero.

Hence, in code, I need to:

- Compute x[i] sequentially as described.

- Ensure that all x[i] are non-negative.

- Ensure that the last two elements, after accounting for x[i], become zero.

Hence, in code, I can iterate from the start, compute x[i], check if they are non-negative, and finally check the last two elements.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func():

numTest = int(input())

for _ in range(0, numTest):

n = int(input())

a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

stop = False

for i in range(0, n - 2):

if a[i] < 0:

print('NO')

stop = True

break

opNum = a[i]

a[i] -= opNum

a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum

a[i + 2] -= opNum

if stop == True:

continue

if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

This code seems to be attempting something similar.

It iterates through the array up to n-2, and for each position i, if a[i] < 0, it immediately prints "NO".

Otherwise, it sets opNum = a[i], and applies the operation at i+1 (since i starts from 0).

Specifically, it subtracts opNum from a[i], 2*opNum from a[i+1], and opNum from a[i+2].

Then, after processing all possible i from 0 to n-3, it checks if the last two elements are zero.

If they are, it prints "YES"; else, "NO".

Wait, but in the first test case, after processing i=0,1,2, the array becomes [0,0,0,0,0], so it should print "YES".

In the second test case, after processing i=0,1,2, the array becomes [0,0,-1,3,1], and since a[2] = -1 < 0, it should print "NO".

Hence, it seems to align with the sample outputs.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me see.

In the first iteration, for i=0:

If a[0] < 0, print "NO".

Else, set opNum = a[0], subtract opNum from a[0], 2*opNum from a[1], opNum from a[2].

So, a[0] becomes 0, a[1] -= 2*opNum, a[2] -= opNum.

Then, for i=1:

If a[1] < 0, print "NO".

Else, set opNum = a[1], subtract opNum from a[1], 2*opNum from a[2], opNum from a[3].

And so on.

This seems similar to the earlier approach of sequentially reducing the elements.

But I need to ensure that all a[i] remain non-negative during the process.

In the first test case:

Initial: [1,3,5,5,2]

After i=0:

opNum = 1

a[0] -=1 => 0

a[1] -=2 =>3-2=1

a[2] -=1 =>5-1=4

Array: [0,1,4,5,2]

After i=1:

opNum=1

a[1]-=1=>0

a[2]-=2=>4-2=2

a[3]-=1=>5-1=4

Array: [0,0,2,4,2]

After i=2:

opNum=2

a[2]-=2=>0

a[3]-=4=>4-4=0

a[4]-=2=>2-2=0

Array: [0,0,0,0,0]

Hence, "YES"

In the second test case:

Initial: [2,4,4,5,1]

After i=0:

opNum=2

a[0]-=2=>0

a[1]-=4=>0

a[2]-=2=>2

Array: [0,0,2,5,1]

After i=1:

opNum=0

a[1]-=0=>0

a[2]-=0=>2

a[3]-=0=>5

Array: [0,0,2,5,1]

After i=2:

opNum=2

a[2]-=2=>0

a[3]-=4=>1

a[4]-=2=>-1

Array: [0,0,0,1,-1]

Since a[4]=-1 <0, "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correct}} \]
