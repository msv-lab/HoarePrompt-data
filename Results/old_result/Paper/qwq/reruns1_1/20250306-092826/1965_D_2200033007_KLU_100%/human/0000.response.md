Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a hidden array 'a' of size 'n', and it's a palindrome. That means the array reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, if n=3, and a=[1,2,1], that's a palindrome because a[1]=a[3]=1.

Now, I'm given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary order. A subarray is a continuous part of the array. So, for a=[1,2,1], the subarrays are [1], [2], [1], [1,2], [2,1], and [1,2,1], with sums 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, and 4 respectively. In the example, one of these sums is missing, and I have to recover the original array 'a', which is a palindrome.

The task is to find any possible palindrome 'a' that matches the given sums. And it's guaranteed that at least one such array exists.

First, I need to understand what's being asked and what I have to work with.

Given:

- t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- n, the size of the array.

- A list of (n(n+1)/2 - 1) subarray sums, missing one subarray sum.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ t ≤ 200

- 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 1000

- Each subarray sum s_i satisfies 1 ≤ s_i ≤ 10^9

- There is always at least one valid solution.

Output:

- For each test case, print n positive integers forming a palindrome that matches the given subarray sums.

Alright, so the first step is to understand the properties of the array and the subarray sums, especially given that the array is a palindrome.

Properties of a Palindromic Array:

- a[i] = a[n+1-i] for all i from 1 to n.

- For example, for n=4: a[1] = a[4], a[2] = a[3].

- For n=5: a[1]=a[5], a[2]=a[4], a[3]=a[3].

So, in essence, the array is mirrored around its center.

Subarray Sums:

- A subarray is a continuous sequence of elements.

- For a palindromic array, some subarrays will have symmetric counterparts.

- The sums of symmetric subarrays will be equal.

Given that, the list of subarray sums provided is missing one sum. My task is to find which sum is missing and then reconstruct the array 'a'.

First, I need to find a way to identify the missing sum and then use that information to find the array 'a'.

Let's think about how to approach this.

I recall that for an array of size n, the number of distinct subarrays is n(n+1)/2. Since one is missing, I have n(n+1)/2 - 1 sums provided.

Given that 'a' is a palindrome, there might be some redundant information in the subarray sums, which could help in identifying the missing one.

Let me consider the properties of subarray sums in a palindromic array.

Observations:

1. Single element subarrays: There are 'n' of these, each a[i].

2. Two-element subarrays: There are 'n-1' of these, each summing to a[i] + a[i+1].

3. And so on, up to the entire array sum.

Given that 'a' is a palindrome, a[i] = a[n+1-i], so sums of symmetric subarrays should be equal.

For example, in n=3:

- Subarrays: [1], [2], [1], [1,2], [2,1], [1,2,1]

- Sums: a1, a2, a1, a1+a2, a2+a1, a1+a2+a1

- Given that a1 = a3, and a2 = a2, the sums are: a1, a2, a1, a1+a2, a1+a2, 2a1 + a2

So, in this case, the sums are: two a1, one a2, two (a1+a2), and one (2a1 + a2).

Given that one sum is missing, I have 5 sums provided, and I need to find the missing one.

How can I find which sum is missing?

One approach is to look for frequencies of sums. Since some sums appear multiple times due to the palindrome property, their frequencies can give clues.

But this might get complicated for larger n.

Let me think differently.

I recall that for an array, the sum of all subarray sums can be calculated using a formula.

For a general array, the sum of all subarray sums is sum(a[i] * (n - i) * i), or something similar.

Wait, more precisely, the sum of sums of all subarrays is sum(a[j] * (j) * (n - j + 1)) for j from 1 to n.

But since 'a' is a palindrome, maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that 'a' is a palindrome and try to express the subarray sums in terms of the elements.

Let me try to find a system of equations based on the subarray sums.

Let me denote a[1] = a[n], a[2] = a[n-1], and so on.

For even n:

- a[1] = a[n]

- a[2] = a[n-1]

- ...

- a[n/2] = a[n/2 + 1]

For odd n:

- a[1] = a[n]

- a[2] = a[n-1]

- ...

- a[(n+1)/2] = a[(n+1)/2]

So, in terms of unique variables, for even n, there are n/2 variables, and for odd n, there are (n+1)/2 variables.

Wait, no. Actually, for even n, there are n/2 pairs: (a1, an), (a2, an-1), ..., (a_{n/2}, a_{n/2 +1}).

For odd n, there are (n-1)/2 pairs plus the middle element.

Wait, but since a is a palindrome, a[i] = a[n+1-i], so for even n, there are n/2 independent variables, and for odd n, there are (n+1)/2 independent variables.

Wait, let's think in terms of indices.

For even n=4:

- a1 = a4

- a2 = a3

So, two independent variables.

For odd n=3:

- a1 = a3

- a2 = a2

So, two independent variables.

Wait, generalizing, for any n, the number of independent variables is ceil(n/2).

Wait, more precisely, it's floor((n+1)/2).

Wait, for n even, it's n/2.

For n odd, it's (n+1)/2.

Wait, in n=3: (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches a1 and a2.

In n=4: floor((4+1)/2)=2, which matches a1 and a2.

Wait, but actually, for n even, it's n/2, and for n odd, it's (n+1)/2.

Wait, in n=5: (5+1)/2=3, which matches a1, a2, a3.

So, number of independent variables is ceil(n/2).

Wait, but in programming terms, it's (n + 1) // 2.

Okay, so the number of unique variables in the array is (n + 1) // 2.

Now, the number of subarrays is n(n+1)/2, and we have n(n+1)/2 -1 sums provided.

So, only one sum is missing.

My task is to find which sum is missing and then reconstruct the array based on that.

But directly solving for the missing sum seems tricky.

Let me consider the sum of all provided subarray sums.

Let S be the sum of all provided subarray sums.

Let M be the missing subarray sum.

Then, S + M equals the sum of all possible subarray sums.

If I can compute the sum of all possible subarray sums in terms of the array elements, then I can find M.

But computing the sum of all subarray sums for a general array is sum(a[j] * (j) * (n - j + 1)) for j from 1 to n.

But since 'a' is a palindrome, maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, perhaps I can find a relationship between the sum of all subarray sums and the array elements.

Let me denote s = sum of all subarray sums.

Then, s = sum over all subarrays of their sum.

This can be rewritten as sum over all j from 1 to n of a[j] * number of subarrays that include a[j].

So, how many subarrays include a[j]?

Well, for a[j], the number of subarrays that include a[j] is j * (n - j + 1).

Wait, no. More precisely, it's the number of subarrays from index i to k where i <= j <= k.

Which is (j) * (n - j + 1).

Wait, for j=1, it's n choices for k (from 1 to n), so n subarrays include a[1].

Similarly, for j=2, (n -1) subarrays include a[2], and so on.

Wait, more precisely, for a[j], the number of subarrays that include a[j] is j * (n - j + 1).

Wait, no, actually, it's (j) * (n - j + 1).

Wait, for j=1: (1)*(n -1 +1)=n

For j=2: (2)*(n-2+1)=2*(n-1)

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, actually, for a[j], the number of subarrays that include a[j] is equal to the number of ways to choose i <= j and k >= j.

So, i can be from 1 to j, and k can be from j to n.

Thus, the total number of subarrays including a[j] is j * (n - j + 1).

So, s = sum over j from 1 to n of a[j] * j * (n - j + 1)

But since 'a' is a palindrome, a[j] = a[n+1-j], so perhaps there is some symmetry here that can be exploited.

But calculating s directly seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look at differences between certain sums to find relationships.

Wait, maybe I should look at the minimal subarrays, like single elements and two-elements subarrays, to find relationships.

Let's consider the single element subarrays. There are 'n' of them, summing to sum(a[i]).

But since 'a' is a palindrome, sum(a[i]) = sum from i=1 to n of a[i] = sum from i=1 to floor(n/2) of (a[i] + a[n+1-i]) + (if n is odd) a[(n+1)/2]

Wait, but since a[i] = a[n+1-i], sum(a) = 2 * sum from i=1 to floor(n/2) of a[i] + (if n is odd) a[(n+1)/2]

So, sum(a) is known if I can find the sum of the unique variables.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider small n to get some intuition.

Take n=3.

Subarrays:

[1], [2], [1], [1,2], [2,1], [1,2,1]

Sums: a1, a2, a1, a1+a2, a2+a1, a1+a2+a1

Given that a1 = a3, a2 = a2.

So sums: a1, a2, a1, a1+a2, a1+a2, 2*a1 + a2

In the example, one sum is missing, say 3.

So, provided sums: 1,2,1,3,4,1

Wait, in the example, n=3, sums provided:1,2,3,4,1, missing one sum.

Wait, in the example, it's 1,2,3,4,1, missing 3.

Wait, but according to my earlier list, sums are a1, a2, a1, a1+a2, a1+a2, 2*a1 + a2

Assuming a1=1, a2=2, sums are:1,2,1,3,3,4

So, provided sums:1,2,3,4,1, missing 3.

So, two 3's are expected, but only one 3 is provided.

Hence, the missing sum is 3.

So, in this case, the missing sum is one of the duplicate sums.

How can I generalize this?

I need a way to identify which sum is missing based on the provided sums.

One idea is to look at the frequencies of the sums.

In the n=3 case:

- Sum a1 appears twice.

- Sum a2 appears once.

- Sum a1 + a2 appears twice.

- Sum 2*a1 + a2 appears once.

So, in general, for n=3, frequencies are:

- a1: twice

- a2: once

- a1 + a2: twice

- 2*a1 + a2: once

Given that, if one sum is missing, and it's one of the duplicate sums, then the frequency will be off.

In the example, provided sums:1,2,3,4,1, missing 3.

So, 1 appears twice, 2 appears once, 3 appears once, 4 appears once.

But expected frequencies are:1 twice,2 once,3 twice,4 once.

Hence, missing 3.

So, perhaps I can collect the frequencies of the provided sums and compare them with the expected frequencies.

But calculating expected frequencies seems tricky for general n.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider the fact that the array is a palindrome and try to express the subarray sums in terms of the unique variables.

Given that, perhaps I can set up equations to solve for the unique variables.

But with n up to 1000 and t up to 200, time efficiency is a concern.

I need a smarter way.

Let me look at the code provided and try to understand the approach.

Looking at the code:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the list of subarray sums, sort them.

- Find 'odds' using func_2(subarraySums).

- Determine if len(odds) > (n + 1) // 2.

- Based on that, calculate the missing sum.

- Append the missing sum to odds, sort them, and use func_3 to get the array 'a'.

- Print the array.

There are several helper functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, func_4.

I need to understand what these functions do.

Let's look at func_1:

def func_1(a):

cts = []

for i in range(len(a)):

sm = 0

for j in range(i, len(a)):

sm = sm + a[j]

cts.append(sm)

cts.sort()

return cts

This function takes an array 'a' and computes the sums of all its subarrays, sorts them, and returns the list.

So, func_1(a) gives all subarray sums of 'a', sorted.

Next, func_2:

def func_2(cts):

odds = []

for ct in cts:

if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:

odds.pop()

else:

odds.append(ct)

return odds

This function seems to be using a stack to keep track of elements, popping when a duplicate is found.

It's effectively removing pairs of identical sums.

So, if a sum appears an even number of times, it's completely removed, and if it appears an odd number of times, one instance remains.

Hence, 'odds' contains sums that appear an odd number of times in the input.

Given that, in the context of the problem, where one sum is missing, the sums that appear an odd number of times in the provided list are likely to be the ones with mismatched frequencies compared to the expected frequencies.

Next, func_3:

def func_3(odds, n):

a = [0] * n

prev = 0

idx = (n - 1) // 2

for x in odds:

if idx == n - 1 - idx:

a[idx] = x

else:

a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2

a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2

prev = x

idx = idx - 1

return a

This function seems to be constructing the array 'a' from the 'odds' list.

It starts from the center of the array and assigns values to a[idx] and a[n-1-idx] based on the differences in 'odds'.

Given that 'odds' contains sums that appear an odd number of times, this seems to be a way to back-calculate the array elements.

Finally, func_4:

def func_4(bigList, smallList):

while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:

bigList.pop()

smallList.pop()

return bigList[-1]

This function seems to be finding the largest element in bigList that is not in smallList by repeatedly popping equal elements from both lists.

Once they differ, it returns the last element of bigList.

This might be used to find the missing sum.

Now, looking back at the main part of the code:

odds = func_2(subarraySums)

missingSum = -1

if len(odds) > (n + 1) // 2:

oddvals = []

evenvals = []

for x in odds:

if x % 2 == 1:

oddvals.append(x)

else:

evenvals.append(x)

if len(evenvals) > 0 and len(oddvals) > 0:

missingSum = evenvals[0] if len(evenvals) == 1 else oddvals[0]

else:

b = func_3(odds, n + 2)

bSums = func_1(b)

y = bSums[-1]

x = func_4(bSums, subarraySums)

missingSum = 2 * x - y

else:

b = func_3(odds, n - 2)

bSums = func_1(b)

y = bSums[-1]

x = func_4(subarraySums, bSums)

missingSum = 2 * x - y

odds.append(missingSum)

odds.sort()

odds = func_2(odds)

ans = func_3(odds, n)

print(*ans)

This seems complicated. Let's try to understand it.

First, it computes 'odds' using func_2, which gives sums appearing an odd number of times in the input.

Then, it checks if the length of 'odds' is greater than (n + 1) // 2.

If it is, it separates 'odds' into oddvals and evenvals based on the values being odd or even.

If there are both even and odd values, it chooses the missing sum to be the first even value if there's only one, else the first odd value.

Otherwise, it constructs a temporary array 'b' using func_3 with n + 2, computes its subarray sums, and finds the missing sum using some formula.

If not, it uses n - 2.

This seems like a heuristic approach to find the missing sum based on the parity of the sums and some temporary array constructions.

Finally, it appends the missing sum to 'odds', sorts them, applies func_2 again to update 'odds', and then uses func_3 to construct the array 'a'.

This seems like a convoluted way to solve the problem, and I'm not entirely sure why it's constructed this way.

Given the complexity of the code, I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let's consider the example provided:

Input:

7

3

1 2 3 4 1

...

Expected Output:

1 2 1

In this case, n=3, provided sums:1,2,3,4,1

Expected array:1,2,1

Let's see if the code correctly handles this.

Compute 'odds':

Provided sums:1,2,3,4,1

After sorting:1,1,2,3,4

Apply func_2:

- odds starts empty.

- 1: not in odds, append 1.

- 1: equals odds[-1], so pop 1.

- 2: not in odds, append 2.

- 3: not in odds, append 3.

- 4: not in odds, append 4.

So, odds = [2,3,4]

len(odds)=3, (n+1)//2=2, so 3 > 2, condition is true.

Then, oddvals=[3], evenvals=[2,4]

len(evenvals)=2, len(oddvals)=1

Since both are present and len(evenvals) > 0 and len(oddvals) > 0, and len(evenvals) !=1, so missingSum = oddvals[0]=3

Then, odds becomes [2,3,4,3], sort to [2,3,3,4], apply func_2:

- 2: append 2

- 3: append 3

- 3: equals odds[-1], pop 3

- 4: append 4

So, odds=[2,4]

Then, use func_3 with odds=[2,4], n=3

idx=(3-1)//2=1

First x=2:

idx=1, n-1-idx=2, but 1 !=2, so a[1]=(2-0)//2=1, a[2]=1, prev=2, idx=0

Next x=4:

idx=0, n-1-idx=3-1-0=2, which is equal to idx=0, so a[0]=4

So, a=[4,1,1]

But this is not a palindrome. Wait, but according to the code, it's printing 1 2 1 in the example.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied func_3.

Let's look at func_3 again:

def func_3(odds, n):

a = [0] * n

prev = 0

idx = (n - 1) // 2

for x in odds:

if idx == n - 1 - idx:

a[idx] = x

else:

a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2

a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2

prev = x

idx = idx - 1

return a

For n=3, idx=1, n-1-idx=2-1=1, which is equal to idx=1, so a[1]=x

But in the first iteration, x=2, so a[1]=2

prev=2

idx=0

Next x=4:

idx=0, n-1-idx=2-1-0=1, which is not equal to idx=0, so a[0]=(4-2)//2=1, a[2]=1

So, a=[1,2,1], which matches the expected output.

Okay, so my earlier mistake was in misinterpreting the condition idx == n - 1 - idx.

In code, it's idx == n - 1 - idx, but in n=3, idx=1, n-1-idx=1, so a[1]=x

Then idx=0, n-1-idx=1, which is not equal to idx=0, so a[0]=(x - prev)//2, a[2]=(x - prev)//2

Which correctly gives [1,2,1]

So, the code seems to work for this case.

Let me check another example.

Take n=4, provided sums:18,2,11,9,7,11,7,2,9

Expected output:7,2,2,7

Let's follow the code.

Sort the provided sums:2,2,7,7,9,9,11,11,18

Apply func_2:

- odds starts empty.

- 2: append 2

- 2: equals odds[-1], pop 2

- 7: append 7

- 7: equals odds[-1], pop 7

- 9: append 9

- 9: equals odds[-1], pop 9

- 11: append 11

- 11: equals odds[-1], pop 11

- 18: append 18

So, odds=[18]

len(odds)=1, (4+1)//2=2, so 1 <=2, condition is false.

So, go to else clause.

b = func_3(odds, n - 2)=func_3([18],2)

For n=2, idx=(2-1)//2=0

x=18:

idx=0, n-1-idx=1, which is not equal to idx=0, so a[0]=(18-0)//2=9, a[1]=9

So, b=[9,9]

Then, bSums = func_1(b) = all subarray sums of [9,9]:

- [9]:9

- [9]:9

- [9,9]:18

Sorted: [9,9,18]

y = bSums[-1] =18

x = func_4(subarraySums, bSums):

bigList = sorted provided sums:2,2,7,7,9,9,11,11,18

smallList = [9,9,18]

Compare from the end:

18 ==18, pop both

11 !=18, so x=11

missingSum =2*11 -18=4

Then, odds=[18,4], sort to [4,18], apply func_2:

- 4: append 4

- 18: append 18

So, odds=[4,18]

Then, use func_3 with odds=[4,18], n=4

idx=(4-1)//2=1

x=4:

idx=1, n-1-idx=3, which is not equal to idx=1, so a[1]=(4-0)//2=2, a[3]=2, prev=4, idx=0

x=18:

idx=0, n-1-idx=3, which is not equal to idx=0, so a[0]=(18-4)//2=7, a[4-1-0]=7

So, a=[7,2,2,7], which matches the expected output.

Good, so it works for this case as well.

Let me consider another example.

Take n=3, provided sums:500000000,1000000000,500000000,500000000,1000000000

Expected output:500000000 500000000 500000000

Let's follow the code.

Sort the provided sums:500000000,500000000,500000000,1000000000,1000000000

Apply func_2:

- 5e8: append 5e8

- 5e8: equals odds[-1], pop 5e8

- 5e8: append 5e8

- 1e9: append 1e9

- 1e9: equals odds[-1], pop 1e9

So, odds=[5e8]

len(odds)=1, (3+1)//2=2, so 1 <2, condition is false.

Go to else clause.

b = func_3([5e8],1)

For n=1, idx=0

x=5e8:

idx=0, n-1-idx=0, so a[0]=5e8

So, b=[5e8]

bSums = func_1(b) = [5e8]

y=5e8

x=func_4(subarraySums, bSums):

bigList: sorted provided sums:5e8,5e8,5e8,1e9,1e9

smallList: [5e8]

Compare from the end:

1e9 !=5e8, so x=1e9

missingSum=2*1e9 -5e8=2e9 -5e8=1.5e9

Wait, but according to the expected output, the array should be [5e8,5e8,5e8], whose subarrays sums are:

- [5e8]:5e8

- [5e8]:5e8

- [5e8]:5e8

- [5e8,5e8]:1e9

- [5e8,5e8]:1e9

- [5e8,5e8,5e8]:1.5e9

So, provided sums are five sums:5e8,5e8,5e8,1e9,1e9, missing 1.5e9

But according to the code, missingSum=1.5e9, which is correct.

Then, odds=[5e8,1.5e9], sort to [5e8,1.5e9], func_2:

- 5e8: append 5e8

- 1.5e9: append 1.5e9

Then, use func_3 with odds=[5e8,1.5e9], n=3

idx=1

x=5e8:

idx=1, n-1-idx=2, not equal, a[1]=(5e8 -0)//2=2.5e7, a[2]=2.5e7, prev=5e8, idx=0

x=1.5e9:

idx=0, n-1-idx=2, not equal, a[0]=(1.5e9 -5e8)//2=5e8, a[3-1-0]=5e8

So, a=[5e8,2.5e7,2.5e7]

But expected output is [5e8,5e8,5e8]

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's an issue with integer division or something.

Wait, (1.5e9 -5e8)=1e9, divided by 2 is 5e8.

Wait, no, 1e9 divided by 2 is 5e8.

So a[0]=5e8, a[2]=5e8

a[1]=(5e8 -0)//2=2.5e7, which is 25000000

So, a=[500000000,25000000,25000000]

But expected is [500000000,500000000,500000000]

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Alternatively, maybe the missing sum was incorrectly identified.

Wait, in this case, the missing sum should be 1.5e9, which seems correct.

But then func_3 is not reconstructing the array properly.

Wait, perhaps there's an issue with how func_3 assigns values.

Looking back at func_3:

for x in odds:

if idx == n - 1 - idx:

a[idx] = x

else:

a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2

a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2

prev = x

idx = idx - 1

In this case, for n=3:

- idx=1, n-1-idx=1, so a[1]=x=5e8

- idx=0, n-1-idx=2, not equal, a[0]=(1.5e9 -5e8)//2=5e8, a[2]=5e8

So, a=[5e8,5e8,5e8]

Wait, but earlier I thought a[1]=(5e8 -0)//2=2.5e7, but actually, prev is initialized to 0.

Wait, in the first iteration, prev=0, x=5e8, idx=1, which is not equal to n-1-idx=2, so a[1]=(5e8 -0)//2=2.5e7, a[2]=2.5e7, prev=5e8, idx=0

Next iteration, x=1.5e9, idx=0, n-1-idx=2, not equal, a[0]=(1.5e9 -5e8)//2=5e8, a[2]=(1.5e9 -5e8)//2=5e8

So, a=[5e8,2.5e7,5e8]

Wait, but a[2] is being overwritten.

Wait, in the first iteration, a[2]=2.5e7, then in the second iteration, a[2]=5e8.

So, final a=[5e8,2.5e7,5e8]

Which is not equal to the expected [5e8,5e8,5e8]

So, perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Alternatively, maybe the approach assumes that the missing sum is the largest sum, but in this case, it's not.

Wait, in this case, the missing sum is 1.5e9, which is larger than the provided sums.

But according to the code, it's correctly identifying it.

Perhaps the issue is in func_3.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust func_3 to handle such cases properly.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in how I'm simulating the code's execution.

Let me check the code again.

Looking back, in func_3, for idx=1, n=3, n-1-idx=2, which is not equal to idx=1, so a[1]=(x - prev)//2, a[2]=(x - prev)//2

Then, for idx=0, n-1-idx=2, which is not equal to idx=0, so a[0]=(next_x - prev)//2, a[2]=(next_x - prev)//2

So, a[2] is being overwritten.

Maybe that's the issue.

In the first iteration, a[2]=2.5e7

In the second iteration, a[2]=5e8

So, final a[2]=5e8

But a[1] was set to 2.5e7 and not updated again.

So, a=[5e8,2.5e7,5e8]

But expected is [5e8,5e8,5e8]

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct a palindromic array `a` of size `n` given all but one of its subarray sums. The array is a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n+1-i]` for all `i`. The task is to determine the correct array `a` based on the provided subarray sums.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Subarray Sums in a Palindromic Array**:
   - Due to the palindrome property, some subarrays have symmetric counterparts, leading to redundant sum information.
   - We need to identify the missing sum and use it to reconstruct the array.

2. **Identifying the Missing Sum**:
   - Use a helper function (`func_2`) to find sums that appear an odd number of times in the input list. These sums likely correspond to the missing subarray sums.
   - Depending on the number of odd-frequency sums, determine the missing sum using specific calculations involving temporary arrays and their subarray sums.

3. **Reconstructing the Array**:
   - Once the missing sum is identified, append it to the list of odd-frequency sums and sort the list.
   - Use another helper function (`func_3`) to reconstruct the array `a` from these sums, ensuring the palindrome property is maintained.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for tc in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    subarraySums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    subarraySums.sort()
    odds = func_2(subarraySums)
    missingSum = -1
    if len(odds) > (n + 1) // 2:
        oddvals = []
        evenvals = []
        for x in odds:
            if x % 2 == 1:
                oddvals.append(x)
            else:
                evenvals.append(x)
        if len(evenvals) > 0 and len(oddvals) > 0:
            missingSum = evenvals[0] if len(evenvals) == 1 else oddvals[0]
        else:
            b = func_3(odds, n + 2)
            bSums = func_1(b)
            y = bSums[-1]
            x = func_4(bSums, subarraySums)
            missingSum = 2 * x - y
    else:
        b = func_3(odds, n - 2)
        bSums = func_1(b)
        y = bSums[-1]
        x = func_4(subarraySums, bSums)
        missingSum = 2 * x - y
    odds.append(missingSum)
    odds.sort()
    odds = func_2(odds)
    ans = func_3(odds, n)
    print(*ans)

def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts

def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds

def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a

def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input and Sorting**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and the list of subarray sums, sort them.

2. **Finding Odd-Frequency Sums**:
   - Use `func_2` to find sums that appear an odd number of times.

3. **Determining the Missing Sum**:
   - Depending on the number of odd-frequency sums, calculate the missing sum using temporary arrays and their subarray sums.

4. **Reconstructing the Array**:
   - Append the missing sum to the odd-frequency sums, sort them, and use `func_3` to reconstruct the array `a`.

5. **Printing the Result**:
   - Print the reconstructed array for each test case.

### Correctness

**Correctness: False**

Upon reviewing the code and testing it with specific examples, discrepancies were found in reconstructing the array for certain inputs. The approach, particularly in identifying and using the missing sum, does not consistently produce the correct palindromic array. Therefore, the code is incorrect for this problem.
