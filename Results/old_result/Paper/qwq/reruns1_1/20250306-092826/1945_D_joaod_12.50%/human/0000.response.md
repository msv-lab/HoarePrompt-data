Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a queue of n people, and Kirill comes late and stands at the end, which is position n. But he doesn't like waiting, so he wants to bribe people to move up in the queue. His goal is to be among the first m people in line, meaning his final position should be at most m.

For each person at position i (starting from 1), there are two values: a_i and b_i.

- a_i is the cost to bribe person i to swap places with Kirill if Kirill is standing at position i.

- b_i is the cost to bribe person k (where j < k < i) to let Kirill pass through.

Kirill can perform this swapping action any number of times, and he wants to minimize the total cost of bribes to reach a position <= m.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When Kirill is at position i, he can choose any position j < i, pay a_j to person j, and also pay b_k for all k between j and i-1.

I need to find the minimum total cost for Kirill to reach a position <= m.

Let me consider an example to understand better.

Take the first sample input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2.

Positions: 1,2,3,4

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Kirill starts at position 4.

He wants to reach position <=2.

Let's see possible ways:

Option 1: Swap directly from 4 to 1.

Cost: a_1 = 7 + sum of b_2, b_3, b_4 = 3 + 8 + 5 = 16

Total: 7 + 16 = 23

Option 2: Swap from 4 to 3, then from 3 to 2.

Swap 4 to 3: pay a_3 = 6 + sum of b_4 = 5 → total 11

Then, swap 3 to 2: pay a_2 = 3 + sum of b_3 = 8 → total 11

Total: 11 + 11 = 22

Option 3: Swap from 4 to 2 directly.

Cost: a_2 = 3 + sum of b_3, b_4 = 8 + 5 = 13

Total: 3 + 13 = 16

Option 4: Swap from 4 to 3, then from 3 to 1.

Swap 4 to 3: 6 + 5 = 11

Swap 3 to 1: a_1 = 7 + b_2 + b_3 = 3 + 8 = 11

Total: 11 + 11 = 22

Option 5: Swap from 4 to 2, then from 2 to 1.

Swap 4 to 2: 3 + 8 + 5 = 16

Swap 2 to 1: a_1 = 7 + b_2 = 3

Total: 16 + 3 = 19

Among these, the minimum is 14, which seems to be a better option that I haven't considered yet. Maybe swapping in a different way.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this without enumerating all possibilities.

I need a systematic approach.

Let me think about this step by step.

If Kirill is at position i, and wants to move to position j < i, the cost is a_j plus sum of b_k for j < k < i.

I can model this as a graph where each position is a node, and there is a directed edge from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

But computing this directly seems inefficient for n up to 2e5.

I need a better way.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a way to compute the cumulative sums efficiently.

Wait, if I iterate from position n down to position 1, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach a position <= m, that might work.

Let me try that.

Initialize total cost as 0.

Start from position n.

For each position v from n down to 1:

- If v <= m, then this is a possible final position. The cost to reach here is total cost plus a_v.

- Otherwise, decide whether to swap with position v or to pay b_v to stay in the current position.

Wait, maybe dynamic programming is the way to go.

Let dp[v] be the minimum cost to reach position v from position n.

I need to compute dp[v] for v from n down to 1, and then take the minimum dp[v] for v <= m.

Base case: dp[n] = 0, since no cost to stay at position n.

For each position v from n-1 down to 1:

- Option 1: Swap from position v+1 to v. Cost: a_v + sum of b_k from k=v to k=v (since j=v, k=v+1 to i-1 where i=v+1, so k=v+1 to v, which is empty). So cost is just a_v.

- Option 2: Stay at position v+1 and pay b_v to pass through.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

If I'm at position i, I can choose to swap with any j < i, paying a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

This seems like a complex dependency.

Maybe I can use the fact that the optimal path can be found by considering only certain swaps.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a shortest path problem in a graph with n nodes, where edges are from i to j for j < i with cost a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

But sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1 can be precomputed using prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_sums where prefix_sums[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i.

Then, sum of b_k from k=j+1 to k=i-1 is prefix_sums[i-1] - prefix_sums[j].

Wait, but j < i, and k should be from j+1 to i-1.

Yes, that's correct.

So, for each i from 2 to n, sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i-1 is prefix_sums[i-1].

Similarly, sum of b_k from k=1 to k=j is prefix_sums[j].

Therefore, sum from k=j+1 to k=i-1 is prefix_sums[i-1] - prefix_sums[j].

Got it.

Now, in the dynamic programming approach:

dp[i] = minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

Initialize dp[n] = 0.

For i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + dp[i+1] + (prefix_sums[i-1] - prefix_sums[i])

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's think again.

If I'm at position i, and I want to swap with position j < i, the cost is a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to k=i-1.

I need to choose the j that minimizes the total cost to reach from n to i via j.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that Kirill can only swap to position j directly from position i, and then proceed from j to the final position.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand how it works.

The given program is:

def func():

cases = int(input())

for c in range(cases):

(na_frente, pos_final) = map(int, input().split())

custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))

custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))

na_frente -= 1

pos_final -= 1

total = 0

best = 10 ** 12

for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):

if v <= pos_final:

if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:

best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

else:

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

print(best)

So, it iterates from na_frente down to 0.

na_frente is n-1, since n is the position where Kirill starts.

pos_final is m-1, since m is the maximum allowed final position.

It maintains a total cost and a best cost.

For each position v from n-1 down to 0:

- If v <= pos_final, it checks if total + a_v is better than the current best.

- Then, it adds to total the minimum between a_v and b_v.

- If v > pos_final, it just adds the minimum between a_v and b_v to total.

Wait, but in the code, it's:

if v <= pos_final:

if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:

best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

else:

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

I need to understand why this works.

Let me try to simulate it with the first sample input.

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

na_frente = 4 -1 = 3

pos_final = 2 -1 =1

Start with total=0, best=1e12

v=3:

v=3 > pos_final=1, so add min(a[3]=9, b[3]=5)=5 to total. total=5

v=2:

v=2 > pos_final=1, so add min(a[2]=6, b[2]=8)=6 to total. total=5+6=11

v=1:

v=1 <= pos_final=1, so check if total + a[1]=7 + 11 =18 < best=1e12. Set best=18

Then, add min(a[1]=7, b[1]=4)=4 to total. total=11+4=15

v=0:

v=0 <= pos_final=1, so check if total + a[0]=15 +7=22 < best=18. No, best remains 18

Add min(a[0]=7, b[0]=3)=3 to total. total=15+3=18

Finally, print best=18

But according to the sample output, it should be 14. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the indices are off. Let's check.

In Python, list indices start at 0.

So, a[0]=7 is position 1, a[1]=3 is position 2, etc.

Wait, in the code, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list starting from 0, but position 1 is a[0].

But in the sample explanation, position 1 has a=7, which matches a[0]=7.

So, v=3 corresponds to position 4, a[3]=9, b[3]=5

v=2 corresponds to position 3, a[2]=6, b[2]=8

v=1 corresponds to position 2, a[1]=3, b[1]=3

v=0 corresponds to position 1, a[0]=7, b[0]=4

Wait, in the first iteration, v=3:

v=3 (> pos_final=1), so total += min(a[3]=9, b[3]=5)=5. total=5

v=2:

v=2 (> pos_final=1), total += min(a[2]=6, b[2]=8)=6. total=5+6=11

v=1:

v=1 <= pos_final=1, so check if total + a[1]=11 + 3=14 < best=1e12. Set best=14

Then, total += min(a[1]=3, b[1]=3)=3. total=11+3=14

v=0:

v=0 <= pos_final=1, check if total + a[0]=14 +7=21 < best=14. No.

total += min(a[0]=7, b[0]=4)=4. total=14+4=18

Print best=14

Ah, in my earlier simulation, I had a[1]=3, not a[1]=7. Wait, a=[7,3,6,9], so a[0]=7, a[1]=3, a[2]=6, a[3]=9.

b=[4,3,8,5], b[0]=4, b[1]=3, b[2]=8, b[3]=5.

So, v=3: total += min(9,5)=5. total=5

v=2: total += min(6,8)=6. total=11

v=1: if 1 <=1, best = min(1e12, 11 +3)=14

Then, total += min(3,3)=3. total=14

v=0: if 0 <=1, check best = min(14, 14 +7)=14

total += min(7,4)=4. total=18

Print best=14

Okay, now it matches the sample output of 14.

So, the code seems correct in this case.

Let me check another sample.

Second sample:

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

n=6, m=2

na_frente=6-1=5

pos_final=2-1=1

a=[6,9,7,1,8,3]

b=[5,8,8,1,4,1]

Initialize total=0, best=1e12

v=5:

v=5 (>1), total += min(a[5]=3, b[5]=1)=1. total=1

v=4:

v=4 (>1), total += min(a[4]=8, b[4]=4)=4. total=5

v=3:

v=3 (>1), total += min(a[3]=1, b[3]=1)=1. total=6

v=2:

v=2 (>1), total += min(a[2]=7, b[2]=8)=7. total=13

v=1:

v=1 <=1, best = min(1e12, 13 +9)=22

total += min(a[1]=9, b[1]=8)=8. total=21

v=0:

v=0 <=1, best = min(22, 21 +6)=21

total += min(a[0]=6, b[0]=5)=5. total=26

Print best=21

But according to the sample output, it should be 22.

Wait, the sample output is 22, but according to this, best=21.

But in the sample output, it's 22.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the code, it's:

if v <= pos_final:

if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:

best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

else:

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

In this case:

v=5: total += min(3,1)=1. total=1

v=4: total += min(8,4)=4. total=5

v=3: total += min(1,1)=1. total=6

v=2: total += min(7,8)=7. total=13

v=1: if 1 <=1, best = min(1e12, 13+9)=22

total += min(9,8)=8. total=21

v=0: if 0 <=1, best = min(22, 21+6)=21

total += min(6,5)=5. total=26

Print best=21

But sample output is 22.

So, perhaps the code is wrong in this case.

Wait, maybe I need to understand the operation correctly.

In the problem, when Kirill swaps from position i to j, he pays a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

But in the code, it seems to accumulate costs based on minimum of a_v and b_v.

This might not accurately represent the operation.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I need to model this as a graph where each position is a node, and edges represent possible swaps with their costs.

Then, use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum cost to reach any position <=m from position n.

But n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, so this approach would be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that Kirill can swap to any position j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k for j < k < i.

This sum can be precomputed using prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i.

Then, sum of b_k from k=j+1 to k=i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

Therefore, total cost to go from n to j is sum of (a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]) for each swap.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[i] = min over j > i of dp[j] + a_i + prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i].

Wait, that might not be correct.

Let me think again.

If Kirill is at position j and swaps to position i (i < j), he pays a_i + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to k=j-1.

Wait, k should be from j to i+1?

Wait, in the problem statement, it's j < i, but in my earlier assumption, I had i < j, which might be confusing.

Let me clarify.

In the problem, Kirill is at position i and chooses j < i, pays a_j and for each k, j < k < i, pays b_k.

So, in the swap from i to j, pays a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

I need to model the cost to reach position j from position n via position i.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to iterate from position n down to position 1, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach any position <=m.

Let me try to think in terms of the given code.

In the given code:

- It iterates from v = na_frente down to 0.

- na_frente = n-1

- pos_final = m-1

- It maintains a total cost, which seems to accumulate the cost of moving from n to v.

- For each v, if v <= pos_final, it checks if total + a_v is better than current best.

- Then, it adds to total the minimum between a_v and b_v.

- If v > pos_final, it just adds the minimum between a_v and b_v to total.

I need to see if this logic is correct.

In the first sample, it correctly computed best=14, matching the sample output.

In the second sample, according to my simulation, best=21, but sample output is 22.

Maybe there's an error in my simulation.

Let me check again.

n=6, m=2

a=[6,9,7,1,8,3]

b=[5,8,8,1,4,1]

na_frente=5

pos_final=1

total=0, best=1e12

v=5:

v=5 >1, total += min(3,1)=1. total=1

v=4:

v=4 >1, total += min(8,4)=4. total=5

v=3:

v=3 >1, total += min(1,1)=1. total=6

v=2:

v=2 >1, total += min(7,8)=7. total=13

v=1:

v=1 <=1, best = min(1e12, 13+9)=22

total += min(9,8)=8. total=21

v=0:

v=0 <=1, best = min(22, 21+6)=21

total += min(6,5)=5. total=26

Print best=21

But sample output is 22.

So, perhaps the code is wrong in this case.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect.

Let me think about what's happening.

In this approach, the total cost accumulates the minimum between a_v and b_v at each step.

But in reality, choosing to pay a_v allows Kirill to move to position v, and paying b_v allows him to pass through v.

But the relationship between a_v and b_v needs to be considered in the context of the swap operation, which involves multiple b_k's.

This seems too simplistic.

Perhaps the code is incorrect.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to either:

- Swap to position j < i, paying a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

- Or, stay at position i and pay b_i to pass through.

But in the code, it's not clearly reflecting this choice.

Maybe I need to model this as a graph and use prefix sums to compute the costs efficiently.

Define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i.

Then, sum of b_k from k=j+1 to k=i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]).

I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position <=m from position n.

This sounds like a shortest path problem.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, a standard Dijkstra would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can only swap to positions j < i, so the graph is directed from i to j for j < i.

This is a DAG, so I can try to compute the dp from higher positions to lower positions.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

Initialize dp[n] = 0.

For i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + dp[i+1] + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[i])

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, to compute dp[i], it should be the minimum over all j < i of dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

This is similar to dp[i] = min over j < i of dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

This can be rewritten as dp[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j)

Let me define aux[j] = dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j

Then, dp[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + min over j < i of aux[j]

So, if I keep track of the minimum aux[j] for j from n down to i, I can compute dp[i] efficiently.

Yes, this seems promising.

I can iterate from i = n down to 1, maintaining the minimum aux[j].

Let me try this with the first sample.

n=4, m=2

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

prefix_b:

prefix_b[0]=4

prefix_b[1]=4+3=7

prefix_b[2]=7+8=15

prefix_b[3]=15+5=20

Initialize dp[4]=0

aux[4] is undefined since there is no position 4 in the array (positions start from 1).

Wait, positions are from 1 to n.

So, dp[4]=0

aux[4] is not needed.

For i=3:

aux[3] = dp[3] - prefix_b[3] + a[3]

But I need to compute dp[3] = prefix_b[2] + min over j <3 of aux[j]

Wait, I need to set up aux[j] for j=4 to 1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate from i=n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum aux[j] for j from n down to i+1.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of current minimum aux.

Initialize min_aux = aux[n] = dp[n] - prefix_b[n] + a[n], but a[n] might not exist.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me redefine.

For i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + min over j > i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a[j])

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate from i=1 to n, but I want to go from n down to 1.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me try to implement this approach step by step.

Initialize dp[n] = 0

Initialize min_aux = dp[n] - prefix_b[n-1] + a[n-1]

Wait, indices are confusing.

Let me consider that positions are 1 to n, and a and b are 0-indexed.

For i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + min_aux

where min_aux = min over j > i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j-1] + a[j-1])

Wait, this seems messy.

Maybe I need to use a different approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can move from position i to any position j < i by paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j < k < i.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position <=m from position n.

This seems like a DAG shortest path problem, but with careful implementation to handle large n.

Perhaps I can use the fact that the graph is a DAG and perform a topological sort, computing dp values accordingly.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an O(n) solution.

Let me see if I can find a pattern.

In the given code, it seems to accumulate the minimum between a_v and b_v at each step, which might not be sufficient.

In the second sample, it gave best=21, but the sample output is 22.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, in the second sample, according to the sample output, it should be 22, but according to my simulation of the code, it would print 21.

But maybe the code is correct, and my simulation is wrong.

Let me check again.

n=6, m=2

a=[6,9,7,1,8,3]

b=[5,8,8,1,4,1]

na_frente=5

pos_final=1

total=0, best=1e12

v=5:

v=5 >1, total += min(3,1)=1. total=1

v=4:

v=4 >1, total += min(8,4)=4. total=5

v=3:

v=3 >1, total += min(1,1)=1. total=6

v=2:

v=2 >1, total += min(7,8)=7. total=13

v=1:

v=1 <=1, best = min(1e12, 13+9)=22

total += min(9,8)=8. total=21

v=0:

v=0 <=1, best = min(22, 21+6)=21

total += min(6,5)=5. total=26

Print best=21

But sample output is 22.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when v <= pos_final, the total cost to reach v is total + a_v, but I also need to consider the sum of b_k for passing through positions between current and v.

This seems more involved.

Perhaps the code is incorrect.

Let me think about another approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform swaps to move from position i to j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j < k < i.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position <=m from position n.

This sounds like a DAG where edges are from i to j for j < i, with cost a_j + sum of b_k from j < k < i.

To compute this efficiently, I can precompute prefix sums of b.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i.

Then, sum of b_k from k=j+1 to k=i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

Now, I need to compute dp[i] = min over j > i of dp[j] + a_j + (prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i])

Wait, no.

Wait, if I'm moving from i to j, with j < i, then the cost is a_j + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

So, dp[j] = min over all possible previous positions k > j of dp[k] + a_j + (prefix_b[k-1] - prefix_b[j])

Wait, this seems complicated.

Let me rearrange:

dp[j] = min over k > j of (dp[k] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) + prefix_b[k-1]

Wait, still messy.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that dp[i] represents the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[n] = 0

For i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[i]) + dp[i+1]

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of dp[j] + (prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i])

This still seems too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to pay a_j to swap to position j, plus the sum of b_k for passing through positions between j and i.

This is similar to paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

So, to minimize the total cost, Kirill should choose the path where the sum of these costs is minimized.

This seems like a classic shortest path problem, but with a specific structure that allows for an O(n) solution.

Perhaps I can iterate from position n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach any position <=m.

Let me try to define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[n] = 0

For i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of dp[j] + (prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i])

This is similar to dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of dp[j] - prefix_b[i] + prefix_b[j-1]

Let me define min_value = min over j > i of dp[j] - prefix_b[i] + prefix_b[j-1]

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Let me try to find a better way.

Let me consider that for each position i, the cost to reach it is a_i plus the cost to reach the next position, minus the sum of b_k from i to the next position.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Maybe I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to pay a_j to swap to position j, and then pay b_k for all positions between j and his current position.

This seems similar to choosing a path where each step has a certain cost.

Perhaps I can model this as a tree where each position has edges to positions less than it, with the defined costs.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the graph is a tree and use dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that at each step, Kirill can choose to swap to any position less than his current position, paying a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to current-1.

So, to minimize the total cost, he should choose the position j that minimizes a_j plus the sum of b_k from j+1 to current-1.

This sum can be expressed using prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i.

Then, sum from k=j+1 to k=current-1 is prefix_b[current-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from current to j is a_j + (prefix_b[current-1] - prefix_b[j])

This can be rewritten as (a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[current-1]

So, for each current, the cost to swap to j is (a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[current-1]

Therefore, the minimum cost to reach j is min over all j < current of dp[j] + (a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[current-1]

Wait, no.

Wait, dp[current] = min over j < current of dp[j] + a_j + (prefix_b[current-1] - prefix_b[j])

Which is dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[current-1] - prefix_b[j]

Rearranged: (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) + prefix_b[current-1]

So, dp[current] = prefix_b[current-1] + min over j < current of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j)

Therefore, if I keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) for j from n down to current+1, I can compute dp[current] efficiently.

Yes, this seems workable.

Let me define aux = dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j

Then, dp[current] = prefix_b[current-1] + min_aux, where min_aux is the minimum aux over j > current.

So, I can iterate from current = n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum aux.

Initialize dp[n] = 0

aux[n] = dp[n] - prefix_b[n-1] + a[n-1]

Wait, positions are from 1 to n, and a and b are 0-indexed.

Wait, to avoid confusion, let's consider that a[0] corresponds to position 1, a[1] to position 2, etc.

So, a[i-1] corresponds to position i.

Similarly, b[i-1] corresponds to position i.

prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i.

So, prefix_b[0] = b[0], prefix_b[1] = b[0] + b[1], etc.

Initialize dp[n] = 0

Set min_aux = dp[n] - prefix_b[n-1] + a[n-1]

Then, for current from n-1 down to 1:

dp[current] = prefix_b[current-1] + min_aux

if current <= m:

min_aux = min(min_aux, dp[current] - prefix_b[current-1] + a[current-1])

else:

min_aux = min(min_aux, dp[current] - prefix_b[current-1] + a[current-1])

Wait, no.

Actually, for current from n down to 1:

min_aux = min over j > current of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a[j])

So, starting from min_aux = dp[n] - prefix_b[n-1] + a[n-1]

Then, for current = n-1:

dp[current] = prefix_b[current-1] + min_aux

Then, min_aux = min(min_aux, dp[current] - prefix_b[current-1] + a[current-1])

And continue down to current=1.

Yes, this seems correct.

Let me try this with the first sample.

n=4, m=2

a=[7,3,6,9] corresponds to position 1:7, 2:3, 3:6, 4:9

b=[4,3,8,5] corresponds to position 1:4, 2:3, 3:8, 4:5

prefix_b:

prefix_b[0]=4

prefix_b[1]=4+3=7

prefix_b[2]=7+8=15

prefix_b[3]=15+5=20

Initialize dp[4]=0

min_aux = dp[4] - prefix_b[3] + a[3] = 0 - 20 +9 = -11

current=3:

dp[3] = prefix_b[2] + min_aux =15 + (-11)=4

min_aux = min(-11, dp[3] - prefix_b[2] + a[2]) = min(-11,4 -15 +6)= min(-11, -5)= -11

current=2:

dp[2] = prefix_b[1] + min_aux =7 + (-11)= -4

min_aux = min(-11, dp[2] - prefix_b[1] + a[1]) = min(-11, -4 -7 +3)= min(-11, -8)= -11

current=1:

dp[1] = prefix_b[0] + min_aux =4 + (-11)= -7

Since m=2, we need dp[1] and dp[2], so minimum of dp[1]=-7 and dp[2]=-4.

But this doesn't make sense, as costs are positive.

I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that dp[j] includes the cost to reach j from n.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the dp definition.

Let me think again.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[n] = 0

For i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[i]) + dp[i+1]

Wait, no.

Wait, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + sum of b_k from j < k < i.

So, to reach i, Kirill must have come from some j > i, paying dp[j] + a_i + sum of b_k from i < k < j.

Wait, I'm getting tangled.

Let me try to implement the approach I thought earlier and see if it matches the sample.

In the first sample, n=4, m=2

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

prefix_b=[4,7,15,20]

Initialize dp[4]=0

min_aux = dp[4] - prefix_b[3] + a[3] =0 -20 +9=-11

current=3:

dp[3]=prefix_b[2] + min_aux=15 + (-11)=4

min_aux = min(-11, dp[3] - prefix_b[2] + a[2])=min(-11,4-15+6)=min(-11,-5)=-11

current=2:

dp[2]=prefix_b[1] + min_aux=7 + (-11)=-4

min_aux = min(-11, dp[2] - prefix_b[1] + a[1])=min(-11,-4-7+3)=min(-11,-8)=-11

current=1:

dp[1]=prefix_b[0] + min_aux=4 + (-11)=-7

Then, the minimum dp[i] for i <=m=2 is min(dp[1], dp[2])=min(-7,-4)=-7

But this is incorrect, as costs can't be negative.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the dp definition.

Let me try to adjust the dp definition.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[n] = 0

For i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of dp[j] + (prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i])

Wait, this still seems incorrect.

Let me consider that dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of dp[j] + sum of b_k from i to j-1.

sum of b_k from i to j-1 is prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i-1]

So, dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i-1]

This can be rearranged as dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i-1] + min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1])

So, define min_aux = min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1])

Then, dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i-1] + min_aux

This seems better.

So, I can iterate from i=n down to 1, keeping track of min_aux.

Initialize dp[n]=0

min_aux = dp[n] + prefix_b[n-1]=0 + prefix_b[n-1]

Then, for i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i-1] + min_aux

if i <= m:

min_aux = min(min_aux, dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

else:

min_aux = min(min_aux, dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Wait, no.

Actually, min_aux is min over j > i of dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1]

So, when moving from i+1 to i, min_aux should be min(min_aux, dp[i+1] + prefix_b[i])

Wait, let's think carefully.

Initialize min_aux for i=n is dp[n] + prefix_b[n-1]

Then, for i=n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i-1] + min_aux

Then, min_aux = min(min_aux, dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Yes, this seems correct.

Let me try with the first sample.
