Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n+1. But he doesn't like waiting, so he wants to move up in the queue to be among the first m people. To do that, he can bribe people in front of him to swap places, and there are costs associated with that.

First, I need to understand the setup. There are n people in the queue, starting from person 1 to person n. Kirill is at position n+1. He can choose to bribe someone who is ahead of him in the queue to swap places with them. When he does that, he has to pay that person a certain amount, which is a_j if he swaps with person j. Additionally, for everyone between positions j and i (the positions between the person he swaps with and his current position), he has to pay them b_k for each of them.

He can do this multiple times, and he wants to minimize the total cost while ensuring that his final position is no more than m.

Okay, so I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position <= m.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to think about it is to consider that Kirill is starting at position n+1 and wants to reach a position between 1 and m inclusive. He can perform swaps with people in front of him, and each swap has a cost associated with it, plus additional costs for passing through positions.

But swapping positions sounds a bit tricky. Maybe I can model this as a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges representing the possibility of moving from one position to another by bribing.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider that Kirill is moving from position n+1 towards position 1, and he wants to stop when he reaches position m or earlier.

So, positions are from 1 to n+1, where 1 is the front of the queue, and n+1 is the back where Kirill starts.

He can move from his current position i to any position j < i by paying a_j plus sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

He wants to reach a position <= m with minimum cost.

Hmm.

Let me try to formalize the cost when moving from position i to position j < i.

The cost is a_j (to swap with j) plus sum of b_k for all k between j and i (excluding j and i).

Wait, checking the problem again: "for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k."

So, it's for each position between j and i, not including j and i.

So, when moving from i to j, cost is a_j + sum of b_k for j < k < i.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, I need to find a sequence of moves that gets Kirill from position n+1 to some position <= m with minimum total cost.

This sounds like a shortest path problem, where positions are nodes, and there are directed edges from i to j < i with cost a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

But with n+1 up to 2e5, building a graph explicitly is not feasible due to time and space constraints.

I need a smarter way to compute the minimum cost.

Let me see if I can find a dynamic programming approach.

Let dp[i] be the minimum cost to reach position i from position n+1.

I need to compute dp[i] for all i from 1 to m, and then take the minimum among them.

Now, how to compute dp[i].

To reach position i, Kirill can come from any position j where j > i, by paying a_i plus sum of b_k for k from i+1 to j-1.

Wait, no. If he moves from position j to position i, he pays a_i (to swap with person i) plus sum of b_k for k from i+1 to j-1.

But actually, according to the problem, when he moves from j to i, he pays a_j (to swap with j) plus sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me carefully read the problem again.

"he can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j. In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k."

So, to move from position i to position j (j < i), the cost is a_j + sum of b_k for j < k < i.

Yes, that's correct.

So, in terms of dp, dp[j] = min over all possible i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k)

But this seems too slow to compute for all j.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Let's consider that Kirill starts at position n+1 and wants to reach position <= m.

He can choose to either:

- Stay at his current position and not move, which means his final position is n+1, but since m can be up to n, he might need to move.

- Or, choose to move to some position j < i, paying the corresponding cost.

But m can be up to n, so he might need to move to positions <= m.

Wait, in the dp approach, dp[i] is the minimum cost to reach position i from position n+1.

To compute dp[i], I need to consider all possible positions j > i, and take the minimum of dp[j] + a_i + sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k.

Wait, no.

Wait, when moving from j to i, cost is a_i + sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k.

Wait, no, according to the problem, it's a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the indices.

Let me try to clarify.

Let me redefine:

Let's say Kirill is at position i, and he wants to move to position j where j < i.

The cost for this move is a_j (to swap with j) plus sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, positions are from 1 to n+1, where 1 is the front.

Wait, but in the problem, when he moves from i to j, j < i, he pays a_j and sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

So, in terms of dp, dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k)

But computing this directly would be too slow for large n.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Maybe I can think of sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k as prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_b[j] = sum_{k=1}^{j} b_k

Then, sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k = prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, the cost when moving from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

Therefore, dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

But this still seems complicated to compute for all j and i.

I need a better way.

Let me consider processing positions from n down to 1, computing the minimum cost to reach each position.

I need to keep track of the minimum dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]

Because in the cost dp[j] = min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

This can be rearranged as dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + min(dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]) for i > j

So, if I can keep track of the minimum of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i > j, then I can compute dp[j].

This seems promising.

Let me define a variable that keeps track of the minimum dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i from j+1 to n+1.

Then, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + min_value

And then, after computing dp[j], I can update the min_value if necessary.

Wait, but dp[i] depends on dp[j] for j < i, so I need to process positions in decreasing order.

Wait, actually, in the above arrangement, dp[j] depends on min(dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]) for i > j.

So, I should process j from n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i > j.

So, I can initialize min_value to dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n], assuming position n+1 is the starting point.

Wait, but position n+1 is not in the array, so I need to handle it carefully.

Let me assume that dp[n+1] = 0, since that's the starting position, and no cost is needed to reach there.

So, dp[n+1] = 0

prefix_b[n] = sum of b_k from k=1 to n

Then, for j from n down to 1:

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j-1] + min_value

where min_value is the minimum of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i > j

But since I'm processing j from n down to 1, I can maintain min_value as the minimum of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i from j+1 to n+1.

Initially, min_value = dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n] = 0 + prefix_b[n]

Then, for j from n down to 1:

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j-1] + min_value

Then, min_value = min(min_value, dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1])

Wait, let's check this.

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j-1] + min_value

Then, dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1] = a_j + min_value

Then, min_value = min(min_value, a_j + min_value)

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the way I'm handling min_value.

Let me think again.

Given dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j-1] + min(dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]) for i > j

Then, dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1] = a_j + min(dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]) for i > j

So, dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1] = a_j + min_value

Therefore, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j-1] + min_value

And then, min_value = min(min_value, dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1]) = min(min_value, a_j - prefix_b[j-1] + min_value + prefix_b[j-1]) = min(min_value, a_j + min_value)

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Maybe I need to consider that dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1] = a_j + min_value

So, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j-1] + min_value

Then, min_value = min(min_value, dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1]) = min(min_value, a_j - prefix_b[j-1] + min_value + prefix_b[j-1}) = min(min_value, a_j + min_value)

Which simplifies to min_value = min_value, which isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j-1] + min_value

And I need to keep track of min_value as the minimum dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i > j

But dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] = a_i - prefix_b[i-1] + min_value + prefix_b[i-1] = a_i + min_value

Wait, this seems cyclic.

Maybe I need to initialize min_value for i = n+1, where dp[n+1] = 0, and prefix_b[n]

Then, for j from n down to 1:

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j-1] + min_value

where min_value is the minimum of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i > j

Then, update min_value = min(min_value, dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1])

Wait, perhaps I can implement this and see.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first test case:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

positions are from 1 to 4, plus position 5 where Kirill starts.

I need to compute dp[j] for j from 1 to 2, and find the minimum dp[j].

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 4

prefix_b[2] = 4+3=7

prefix_b[3] = 7+8=15

prefix_b[4] = 15+5=20

Initialize dp[5] = 0

min_value = dp[5] + prefix_b[4] = 0 + 20 = 20

Now, for j=4:

dp[4] = a[4] - prefix_b[3] + min_value = 9 - 15 + 20 = 14

Then, min_value = min(min_value, dp[4] + prefix_b[3]) = min(20, 14 + 15) = min(20,29) =20

For j=3:

dp[3] = a[3] - prefix_b[2] + min_value =6 -7 +20=19

min_value = min(20, 19+7)=min(20,26)=20

For j=2:

dp[2]=3 -4 +20=23 -4=19

Wait, 3 -4 is -1, plus 20 is 19.

Wait, no: 3 -7 is -4, plus 20 is 16.

Wait, prefix_b[1]=4, for j=2, prefix_b[1]=4.

Wait, no, j=2, prefix_b[1]=4.

So dp[2]=a[2]-prefix_b[1]+min_value=3-4+20=19

Then min_value=min(20,19+4)=min(20,23)=20

For j=1:

dp[1]=7 -0 +20=27

min_value=min(20,27+0)=min(20,27)=20

Then, the minimum dp[j] for j=1 to 2 is min(dp[1],dp[2])=min(27,19)=19

But according to the sample output, it should be 14.

So, something's wrong with this approach.

Wait, maybe I messed up the indices.

Let me check again.

n=4, positions 1 to 4, Kirill starts at 5.

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[0]=0

prefix_b[1]=4

prefix_b[2]=4+3=7

prefix_b[3]=7+8=15

prefix_b[4]=15+5=20

Initialize dp[5]=0

min_value=dp[5]+prefix_b[4]=0+20=20

For j=4:

dp[4]=a[4]-prefix_b[3]+min_value=9-15+20=14

min_value=min(min_value, dp[4]+prefix_b[3])=min(20,14+15)=min(20,29)=20

For j=3:

dp[3]=6 - prefix_b[2] + min_value=6 -7 +20=19

min_value=min(20,19+7)=min(20,26)=20

For j=2:

dp[2]=3 - prefix_b[1] + min_value=3 -4 +20=19

min_value=min(20,19+4)=min(20,23)=20

For j=1:

dp[1]=7 - prefix_b[0] + min_value=7 -0 +20=27

min_value=min(20,27+0)=20

Then, minimum dp[j] for j=1 to 2 is min(27,19)=19, but sample output is 14.

Wait, but dp[4]=14, which matches the sample output.

Wait, maybe m=2 means positions 1 and 2, but in this case, dp[2]=19 and dp[1]=27, minimum is 19, but sample output is 14, which is dp[4].

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted m.

Wait, m is the maximum allowable final position, so positions <=m are acceptable.

So, m=2 means positions 1 and 2.

But in the above calculation, dp[2]=19 and dp[1]=27, so minimum is 19, but sample output is 14.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Kirill can stop at any position <=m, not necessarily position m.

But in this case, position 4 has dp[4]=14, which is better than dp[2]=19, but position 4 is not <=m=2.

Wait, no, position 4 is not <=2, so it's not acceptable.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where positions are nodes, and there are edges from i to j for j < i with cost a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

Then, find the minimum cost path from n+1 to any position <=m.

But with n up to 2e5, building a graph is not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a priority queue and Dijkstra's algorithm, but that might be too slow.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to either:

- Stay at his current position, which is not acceptable since he needs to be at position <=m.

- Move to any position j < i by paying a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position <=m.

Maybe I can iterate from position n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach position <=m.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming where dp[i] is the minimum cost to reach position i.

Initialize dp[n+1]=0.

Then, for each i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + min(dp[j] + sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k) for all j > i.

But this is similar to what I did before.

Wait, perhaps I can use prefix sums for the sum of b_k.

Define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to i.

Then, sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k = prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i]

So, dp[i] = a_i + min(dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i]) for j > i

This seems similar to what I did earlier.

But perhaps I can rearrange it.

dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i] + min(dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1]) for j > i

Let me define min_value = min(dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1]) for j > current i

Then, dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i] + min_value

Then, update min_value = min(min_value, dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

This is similar to what I did earlier, but perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me try again with the first sample input.

n=4, m=2

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

prefix_b=[0,4,7,15,20]

Initialize dp[5]=0

min_value=dp[5]+prefix_b[4]=0+20=20

For i=4:

dp[4]=9 - prefix_b[4] + min_value =9 -20 +20=9

Then, min_value=min(min_value, dp[4]+prefix_b[3])=min(20,9+15)=min(20,24)=20

For i=3:

dp[3]=6 - prefix_b[3] + min_value=6 -15 +20=11

min_value=min(20,11+7)=min(20,18)=18

For i=2:

dp[2]=3 - prefix_b[2] + min_value=3 -7 +18=14

min_value=min(18,14+4)=min(18,18)=18

For i=1:

dp[1]=7 - prefix_b[1] + min_value=7 -4 +18=21

min_value=min(18,21+0)=min(18,21)=18

Then, the minimum dp[j] for j=1 to 2 is min(21,14)=14, which matches the sample output.

Great, so this seems correct.

In this approach, I process positions from n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1] for j > i.

Then, dp[i] = a_i - prefix_b[i] + min_value

And then update min_value = min(min_value, dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Finally, take the minimum dp[j] for j from 1 to m.

This seems to work.

Now, let's see the given program and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

cases = int(input())

for c in range(cases):

(na_frente, pos_final) = map(int, input().split())

custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))

custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))

na_frente -= 1

pos_final -= 1

total = 0

best = 10 ** 12

for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):

if v <= pos_final:

if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:

best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:

total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]

else:

total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]

print(best)

Wait, this seems different from what I derived.

In this code, it's iterating from na_frente down to 0.

na_frente is n-1, since n is the number of people in the queue, and positions are from 1 to n, with Kirill at n+1.

Wait, in the code, na_frente = n-1, since it's zero-based.

Wait, no, in the code, na_frente is input n, which is the number of people in the queue, and pos_final is m.

Then, na_frente -=1 and pos_final -=1 to make them zero-based indices.

Then, it initializes total=0 and best=10^12.

Then, loops from v=na_frente down to 0.

If v <= pos_final:

if best > total + a[v], then best = total + a[v]

then, if a[v] < b[v], total += a[v], else total += b[v]

Else:

if a[v] < b[v], total += a[v], else total += b[v]

Finally, print best.

Wait, this seems too simplistic compared to what I derived.

In my derivation, I had to consider prefix sums and maintain a minimum value.

But in this code, it's just iterating backwards, keeping a running total, and updating best when v <= pos_final.

This seems too naive to handle the problem correctly.

Let me test it with the first sample input.

n=
