Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of numbers, and I need to split it into two subsequences, s and t. A subsequence can be formed by deleting some elements from the original array, including none or all. Then, for each of these subsequences, I need to calculate the penalty, which is the number of times an element is less than the next one in the subsequence. Finally, I need to minimize the sum of penalties from both subsequences.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], some subsequences could be [1, 3, 5], [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], or even an empty sequence.

Now, the penalty for a subsequence is the number of times an element is less than the next one. So, for example, in [1, 3, 2], there's one penalty because 3 < 2. In [1, 2, 3], there are two penalties because 1 < 2 and 2 < 3. In [3, 2, 1], there are no penalties because no element is less than the next.

My goal is to split the original array into two subsequences such that the sum of their penalties is minimized.

Let me think about this. Since I can split the array into two subsequences in any way, and the order in the subsequence must be maintained, I need to decide for each element whether it goes to s or t, with the constraint that the relative order is preserved.

I need to minimize the sum of penalties, which is the total number of ascending steps in both subsequences.

I recall that in sequences, if I have a sequence and I want to minimize the number of ascending steps, I might want to maximize the number of descending steps, because descending steps don't contribute to the penalty.

Wait, actually, the penalty is for b_i < b_{i+1}, so ascending steps contribute to the penalty. So, to minimize the penalty, I want to minimize the number of times an element is less than the next one in both subsequences.

One way to minimize the sum of penalties is to distribute the elements into s and t such that in each subsequence, the number of ascending steps is minimized.

I wonder if it's possible to split the sequence into two decreasing subsequences. Because in a decreasing subsequence, there are no ascending steps, so the penalty would be zero for each subsequence, leading to a total penalty of zero.

But, not all sequences can be split into two decreasing subsequences. For example, in [1, 2, 3], it's impossible to split it into two decreasing subsequences such that every element is in exactly one of them.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's okay to have empty subsequences, and every element must be in either s or t, but not both.

So, for [1, 2, 3], one possible splitting is s = [1, 3] and t = [2]. In s, 1 < 3, so p(s) = 1. In t, it's just [2], so p(t) = 0. Total penalty is 1.

Another splitting could be s = [1, 2, 3] and t = []. In s, p(s) = 2. Total penalty is 2.

Another splitting is s = [1] and t = [2, 3]. p(s) = 0, p(t) = 1. Total penalty is 1.

Another splitting is s = [2] and t = [1, 3]. p(s) = 0, p(t) = 1. Total penalty is 1.

Another splitting is s = [1] and t = [2], with remaining elements somehow assigned, but I need to make sure all elements are assigned to either s or t.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "every element of a is either in s or t", and s and t are subsequences, meaning that elements are chosen in order, without changing the relative order.

So, in [1, 2, 3], if I choose s = [1, 3] and t = [2], that's valid, with p(s) = 1 and p(t) = 0, total penalty 1.

But, is there a way to have a total penalty of 0? Well, no, because in any subsequence that contains both 1 and 3, there's an ascending step from 1 to 3.

Wait, unless I put 1 and 3 in different subsequences. Let's try s = [1, 2] and t = [3]. In s, p(s) = 1 (1 < 2), p(t) = 0. Total penalty 1.

Alternatively, s = [1] and t = [2, 3]. p(s) = 0, p(t) = 1. Total penalty 1.

Seems like the minimal penalty is 1 in this case.

But, in the third test case of the example input, with all elements being 3, the minimal penalty is 0, which makes sense because I can put all elements in one subsequence, say s = [3,3,3,3,3], and p(s) = 0, since no element is less than the next.

In the first test case, with [1,2,3,4,5], the minimal penalty is 3, as shown in the example.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, if I split s = [1,3,5] and t = [2,4], then p(s) = 2 (1 < 3 and 3 < 5), p(t) = 1 (2 < 4), total penalty 3.

Alternatively, if I split s = [1,2,3,4,5] and t = [], penalty is 4 + 0 = 4, which is worse.

Or s = [1,3,5] and t = [2,4], penalty 2 + 1 = 3.

Or s = [1,2,5] and t = [3,4], penalty 2 + 1 = 3.

Seems like 3 is the minimal.

But is there a way to get a lower penalty? Maybe not.

In the second test case, with [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3], the minimal penalty is 1.

Looking at the sequence, perhaps splitting it into two decreasing subsequences as much as possible would help.

For example, s = [8,3,1], t = [2,1,7,4,3]. In s, p(s) = 0 (since 8 > 3 > 1), in t, p(t) = 1 (2 < 7). Total penalty 1.

Alternatively, s = [8,2,1], t = [3,1,7,4,3], p(s) = 0, p(t) = 1, total penalty 1.

Seems consistent.

In the third test case, [3,3,3,3,3], splitting s = [3,3,3,3,3], t = [], penalty 0 + 0 = 0.

Perfect.

So, the strategy seems to be to maximize the number of decreasing runs in the two subsequences.

I need to assign elements to s or t in a way that minimizes the number of ascending steps in both subsequences.

I recall that in sequences, the number of ascending steps is related to the number of increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as finding two decreasing subsequences that cover the entire sequence.

But, in general, it's not always possible to split a sequence into two decreasing subsequences.

So, maybe I need to find a way to split the sequence such that the total number of ascending steps in both subsequences is minimized.

I need to think of an algorithm that can achieve this.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

I can iterate through the sequence and decide for each element whether to put it in s or t, while trying to minimize the penalties.

I need to maintain the relative order in both s and t.

Let me think about maintaining the current状态 of s and t.

Suppose I keep track of the last elements in s and t.

When I consider a new element, I choose to put it in the subsequence where it forms the least number of new ascending steps.

Wait, but since the subsequence must maintain the order, I need to ensure that the element is greater than or equal to the last element in the subsequence to avoid creating an ascending step.

Wait, no. Because the penalty is for b_i < b_{i+1}, so if I have b_i >= b_{i+1}, there's no penalty.

So, to minimize penalties, I want to maximize the number of b_i >= b_{i+1} in both subsequences.

In other words, I want as many non-increasing steps as possible.

So, for each new element, I should try to put it in a subsequence where it is less than or equal to the last element of that subsequence.

If I can't find such a subsequence, I have to put it in a subsequence where it is greater than the last element, which will add to the penalty.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain the last elements of s and t, and for each new element, choose to put it in the subsequence where it is >= the last element, if possible.

If it can't be >= in either subsequence, then I have to put it in the subsequence where it causes the least increase.

Wait, this seems similar to the patience sorting algorithm for finding the longest increasing subsequence.

In patience sorting, you have piles of cards, and you place each new card on the leftmost pile where it is >= the top card of that pile.

The number of piles gives the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Here, I have two "piles" corresponding to s and t.

So, perhaps I can maintain s and t as decreasing sequences, and for each new element, place it on the subsequence where it is <= the last element.

If it can't be placed on either subsequence because it is greater than the last elements of both, then I have to choose one subsequence to place it, which will increase the penalty.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a variation of the patience sorting algorithm, but with two piles.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize two lists, s and t, both empty.

Initialize a counter for penalties, c = 0.

For each element in the array:

- If the element <= last element of s, append it to s.

- Else if the element <= last element of t, append it to t.

- Else, append it to the subsequence (s or t) where the difference between the last element and the current element is minimized, and increment the penalty counter.

Wait, but in this case, since I have to choose one subsequence to place it, and it will create an ascending step, which adds to the penalty.

Wait, but I need to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of penalties from s and t.

I need to choose the subsequence where placing the element causes the least increase in penalties.

Wait, perhaps I need to keep track of the number of ascending steps in each subsequence so far, and choose the subsequence where adding this element increases the penalty the least.

But that seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to maximize the number of descending steps in both subsequences.

The more descending steps I have, the fewer ascending steps I will have.

Wait, but the penalty is only for ascending steps, not descending steps.

So, I need to minimize the number of ascending steps.

To minimize ascending steps, I need to maximize the number of non-ascending steps.

In other words, maximize the number of b_i >= b_{i+1} in both subsequences.

So, for each subsequence, I want it to be as non-increasing as possible.

Hence, when placing a new element, I should try to place it in a subsequence where it is <= the last element.

If I can't, I have to place it in a subsequence where it is > the last element, which will add to the penalty.

So, in this approach, I need to maintain two decreasing subsequences as much as possible.

This seems similar to the problem of dividing a sequence into a minimum number of decreasing subsequences, which is related to the heaven and hell problem.

Wait, in the heaven and hell problem, we have to divide sequences into decreasing subsequences.

But here, I have two subsequences, s and t.

So, perhaps I can model this as dividing the sequence into two decreasing subsequences.

But, as I saw in the first test case, it's not always possible to divide into two decreasing subsequences.

Hence, I need to allow for some ascending steps, and count those as penalties.

So, perhaps I can use a greedy approach where I maintain the last elements of s and t.

For each new element, if it is <= the last element of s, append it to s.

Else if it is <= the last element of t, append it to t.

Else, choose the subsequence where the last element is as close as possible to the current element, and append it there, incrementing the penalty counter.

Wait, but I need to choose the subsequence where adding this element causes the least increase in penalties.

Since adding an element that is > the last element in a subsequence adds one penalty, I need to choose which subsequence to add it to.

Wait, perhaps it doesn't matter which subsequence I choose to add it to, the penalty will increase by one in either case.

Hence, I can choose to add it to the subsequence that has the smallest last element, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I need to track not only the last elements but also the number of penalties so far in each subsequence.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize s and t as empty lists, and penalties for s and t as 0.

For each element in the array:

- If element <= last element of s, append it to s, penalties remain the same.

- Else if element <= last element of t, append it to t, penalties remain the same.

- Else, choose to append it to the subsequence where the last element is smaller, and increment the penalty counter for that subsequence.

Wait, but in this case, since both last elements are smaller than the current element, adding it will create an ascending step, hence increment the penalty.

So, it doesn't matter which subsequence I choose, the penalty increases by one.

Hence, I can choose either s or t to append the element to, and increment the total penalty counter.

Wait, but maybe I should choose the subsequence that has the smaller last element, to minimize the "increase" in penalty.

But, since the penalty is just +1 for each ascending step, choosing either subsequence will just increment the total penalty by one.

Hence, it's equivalent to choose either subsequence.

So, perhaps I can just keep track of the last elements of s and t, and decide where to place the current element.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Initialize last_s = some large value, last_t = some large value.

Initialize penalty = 0.

For each element in the array:

- If element <= last_s:

- Append to s

- last_s = element

- penalties remain the same

- Elif element <= last_t:

- Append to t

- last_t = element

- penalties remain the same

- Else:

- Choose to append to the subsequence with the larger last element.

- Update the last element of that subsequence to be the current element.

- Increment the penalty counter by one.

Wait, but I need to choose which subsequence to append to.

Wait, perhaps I should choose the subsequence whose last element is smaller than the current element, but since both are smaller, I can choose either.

Wait, perhaps I should choose the subsequence with the smaller last element, so that the potential for future elements to fit in without creating more penalties is higher.

Wait, no. Since I have to append an element that is larger than both last_s and last_t, choosing either subsequence will create an ascending step, hence increment the penalty.

Hence, perhaps I can choose randomly, but to optimize, maybe choose the subsequence that allows more elements to follow without creating additional penalties.

But that seems complicated.

Let me consider that, in this scenario, since both s and t have last elements smaller than the current element, choosing either will result in the same penalty increase.

Hence, I can choose, say, s, append the element to s, set last_s to the current element, and increment the penalty counter.

Alternatively, choose t, append to t, set last_t to the current element, and increment the penalty counter.

Since both choices lead to the same increase in penalty, it doesn't matter which one I choose.

Hence, I can just choose one of them, say s, and proceed.

Wait, but maybe there is a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the minimal number of ascending steps needed so far.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the current element index, and j is some state representing the last elements of s and t.

But with n up to 2e5, a standard DP approach would be too slow.

Hence, I need a more efficient approach.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain two variables: the last elements of s and t.

Initialize last_s and last_t to -1.

Initialize penalty = 0.

For each element in the array:

- If element <= last_s:

- Append to s

- last_s = element

- penalties remain the same

- Elif element <= last_t:

- Append to t

- last_t = element

- penalties remain the same

- Else:

- If last_s < last_t:

- Append to s

- last_s = element

- Else:

- Append to t

- last_t = element

- In either case, increment penalty by 1

Wait, this seems similar to what I thought earlier.

But I need to make sure that I'm minimizing the penalties.

Wait, perhaps choosing to append to the subsequence with the larger last element would be better, because it allows more flexibility for future elements.

Wait, no. If I have last_s = 5 and last_t = 10, and the current element is 6, if I append it to s (last_s = 5), then s becomes [ ..., 5, 6 ], which has an ascending step, penalty increases by one.

If I append it to t (last_t = 10), then t becomes [ ..., 10, 6 ], which is decreasing, no penalty.

Wait, but in this case, appending to t doesn't increase the penalty, while appending to s does.

Hence, in this scenario, choosing to append to t is better.

Hence, perhaps I should choose to append to the subsequence where the last element is as large as possible, to maximize the chances of future elements being <= that last element.

Wait, but in the above example, appending to t with last_t = 10, and current element 6, which is < 10, so no penalty.

But, in general, if the current element is > both last_s and last_t, I have to choose one subsequence to append it to, which will create an ascending step.

Hence, in such cases, I have to increment the penalty.

But in the scenario where current element is < some last elements, I can choose to append it to that subsequence without increasing the penalty.

Hence, perhaps I can maintain last_s and last_t, and for each element:

- If element <= last_s:

- Append to s

- last_s = element

- penalties remain the same

- Elif element <= last_t:

- Append to t

- last_t = element

- penalties remain the same

- Else:

- Choose to append to the subsequence with the larger last element.

- Set the last element of that subsequence to the current element.

- Increment the penalty counter by one.

Wait, but in the earlier example, with last_s = 5 and last_t = 10, and current element = 6:

- 6 > last_s (5), so can't append to s without creating an ascending step.

- 6 < last_t (10), so can append to t without creating an ascending step.

Hence, in this case, choosing to append to t is better.

Hence, perhaps I should choose to append to the subsequence where the last element is greater than the current element, if possible.

Wait, but in the general case, if the current element is > both last_s and last_t, I have to choose one subsequence to append it to, and create an ascending step.

In this case, it doesn't matter which one I choose, the penalty increases by one.

Hence, I can choose either s or t to append to.

To make it efficient, perhaps I can choose to append to the subsequence with the smaller last element, to maximize the chances that future elements can be appended without creating more penalties.

Wait, but if I choose to append to the subsequence with the smaller last element, a larger last element might be better for future elements.

Wait, let's think about it.

Suppose last_s = 5 and last_t = 10, and current element = 6.

Option 1: append to s.

- s's last element becomes 6.

- t's last element remains 10.

- penalty increases by one.

Option 2: append to t.

- t's last element becomes 6.

- s's last element is 5.

- penalty increases by one.

Now, for future elements:

- If the next element is 7:

- 7 > 5 (s's last element), so can't append to s without penalty.

- 7 > 6 (t's last element), so can't append to t without penalty.

- Hence, have to choose one subsequence to append to, creating another penalty.

- If I choose to append to s:

- s's last element becomes 7.

- t's last element is 6.

- penalty increases by one.

- If I choose to append to t:

- t's last element becomes 7.

- s's last element is 5.

- penalty increases by one.

- If the next element is 4:

- 4 < 5 (s's last element), so can append to s without penalty.

- 4 < 6 (t's last element), so can append to t without penalty.

- Hence, choose either, penalties remain the same.

Hence, in this scenario, it doesn't matter which subsequence I choose to append the element to when I have to create a penalty.

Hence, perhaps I can just choose one subsequence to append to when forced to create a penalty.

Now, let's consider the implementation.

I need to keep track of the last elements of s and t.

Initialize last_s and last_t to -1 (or some value smaller than any possible element).

Initialize penalty = 0.

For each element in the array:

- If element <= last_s:

- Append to s

- last_s = element

- penalties remain the same

- Elif element <= last_t:

- Append to t

- last_t = element

- penalties remain the same

- Else:

- Choose to append to the subsequence with the larger last element.

- Set the last element of that subsequence to the current element.

- Increment penalty by one.

Wait, but in the first step, when last_s and last_t are -1, the first element will be appended to s, setting last_s to that value, with no penalty.

Then, for the next elements, decide based on the above rules.

Wait, but in the first test case, [1,2,3,4,5], with s starting at 1 and t starting at -1:

- Element 1: append to s, last_s = 1, penalty = 0

- Element 2: 2 > last_s (1), so choose to append to s or t.

- Choose to append to s: s becomes [1,2], last_s = 2, penalty = 1

- Or append to t: t becomes [2], last_t = 2, penalty = 1

- Element 3: 3 > last_s (2), 3 > last_t (2), choose to append to s or t.

- Append to s: s becomes [1,2,3], last_s = 3, penalty = 2

- Or append to t: t becomes [2,3], last_t = 3, penalty = 2

- Element 4: 4 > last_s (3), 4 > last_t (3), choose to append to s or t.

- Append to s: s becomes [1,2,3,4], last_s = 4, penalty = 3

- Or append to t: t becomes [2,3,4], last_t = 4, penalty = 3

- Element 5: 5 > last_s (4), 5 > last_t (4), choose to append to s or t.

- Append to s: s becomes [1,2,3,4,5], last_s = 5, penalty = 4

- Or append to t: t becomes [2,3,4,5], last_t = 5, penalty = 4

But in the example, the minimal penalty is 3, which matches the penalty when splitting s = [2,4,5] and t = [1,3], as mentioned in the problem.

Wait, but according to my algorithm, whichever subsequence I choose to append the new element to when it's greater than both last_s and last_t, the penalty increases by one each time.

Hence
