Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. Stepan has to send n messages at specific moments, and his phone has a certain amount of charge. The phone loses charge over time, and there are costs associated with turning it on and off. I need to figure out if it's possible for Stepan to send all the messages without the phone running out of charge.

First, let's parse the input. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have:

- n: the number of messages

- f: the initial charge of the phone

- a: the charge consumed per unit of time the phone is on

- b: the charge consumed each time the phone is turned off and then turned back on

Then, there's a list of n integers, m1 to mn, which are the moments when the messages need to be sent, and these moments are in increasing order.

The key here is that Stepan can choose when to turn the phone on and off to manage the charge effectively. He can turn the phone on just before sending a message and turn it off immediately after, or keep it on for multiple message sends if they are close together in time.

I need to determine for each test case whether it's possible for Stepan to send all the messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below at any point.

Let me think about how the charge is consumed:

1. If the phone is kept on for a duration of t units of time, it consumes a*t units of charge.

2. Each time the phone is turned off and then turned back on, it consumes b units of charge.

The goal is to minimize the charge consumption while ensuring the phone is on at the moments when messages are sent.

One approach is to consider the intervals between message sending moments and decide whether to keep the phone on during those intervals or to turn it off and on again for each message.

Let's consider that between two consecutive message sending moments, say mi and mi+1, if Stepan keeps the phone on, the charge will decrease by a*(mi+1 - mi). Alternatively, if he turns the phone off after mi and turns it back on at mi+1, the charge will decrease by b.

So, for each interval between consecutive messages, Stepan has a choice:

- Keep the phone on: consume a*(mi+1 - mi)

- Turn the phone off and on again: consume b

He should choose the option that consumes less charge for each interval.

Wait, but it's not just about choosing for each interval independently because turning the phone on and off has a fixed cost b, regardless of the time between messages.

So, for each interval between mi and mi+1, the charge consumed if he keeps the phone on is a*(mi+1 - mi), and if he turns it off and on again, it's b.

He should choose the smaller of these two options for each interval.

But, I need to consider that the phone is initially on at moment 0, and there might be a cost associated with turning it off and on at the beginning.

Let me think about the initial state: at moment 0, the phone is on, and it has f units of charge.

I need to manage the charge such that at each mi, there is enough charge to send the message.

Let's consider the sequences of operations:

- Start with the phone on at moment 0 with f charge.

- For each message sending moment mi, ensure that the phone is on at that moment with sufficient charge.

- Between mi and mi+1, decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again based on which option consumes less charge.

Wait, but it's not just about consuming charge between messages; the charge is also consumed up to the first message.

So, from moment 0 to m1, if he keeps the phone on, it will consume a*m1 charge. Alternatively, he could turn the phone off at moment 0 and turn it on at m1, consuming b charge.

But, since the phone is initially on at moment 0, he might choose to keep it on until m1, or turn it off and on at m1.

Similarly, between m1 and m2, he can choose to keep the phone on, consuming a*(m2 - m1), or turn it off and on again at m2, consuming b.

This pattern continues for all message sending moments.

So, for each consecutive pair of message moments, mi and mi+1, he has to decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again, choosing the option that consumes less charge for each interval.

Additionally, there is the initial interval from moment 0 to m1.

So, I can model this as a sequence of intervals, where for each interval, I choose the minimum charge consumption option.

Then, I can calculate the total charge consumed and check if the remaining charge is greater than zero after all the message sends.

Wait, but I need to make sure that at each message sending moment, there is enough charge to send the message.

Let me think about it step by step.

Initialize the remaining charge to f.

Then, for each interval between mi and mi+1, subtract the minimum of a*(mi+1 - mi) and b from the remaining charge.

Wait, but that might not be entirely accurate because the charge consumption for keeping the phone on is continuous over time, but the decision to turn it off and on is a discrete event.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the sequence of message moments: m0=0, m1, m2, ..., mn.

I need to manage the phone's on and off states between these moments to minimize charge consumption.

But since the phone is initially on at moment 0, I need to consider the charge consumption from m0 to m1, then from m1 to m2, and so on.

For each interval from mi to mi+1, I can choose to:

1. Keep the phone on: consume a*(mi+1 - mi)

2. Turn the phone off at mi and on at mi+1: consume b

Then, I should choose the option that consumes less charge for each interval.

So, for each interval, subtract the minimum of a*(mi+1 - mi) and b from the remaining charge.

After all intervals, if the remaining charge is greater than zero, then it's possible; otherwise, it's not.

Wait, but I need to make sure that at each mi, there is enough charge to send the message.

So, perhaps I need to ensure that just before sending each message, there is enough charge.

Wait, but since the charge consumption is continuous when the phone is on, and discrete when turning it off and on, I need to model this carefully.

Let me consider that between mi and mi+1, if I keep the phone on, the charge decreases by a*(mi+1 - mi) during that interval.

If I turn the phone off at mi and on at mi+1, the charge decreases by b at mi.

Wait, but actually, turning the phone off and on again consumes b units of charge at the time of turning it on.

Wait, the problem says: "turning it off and on consumes b units of energy each time."

So, each time Stepan decides to turn off the phone and then turn it on again, it consumes b units of charge.

He can choose to keep the phone on between mi and mi+1, consuming a*(mi+1 - mi), or turn it off at mi and on again at mi+1, consuming b.

He should choose the option with the lesser charge consumption for each interval.

So, for each interval between mi and mi+1, he chooses the minimum between a*(mi+1 - mi) and b.

Then, the total charge consumed is the sum of these minimum values for all consecutive intervals.

If the initial charge f is greater than or equal to this total consumption, then it's possible to send all messages; otherwise, it's not.

Wait, but I need to make sure that at each mi, there is enough charge to send the message.

Is there a possibility that even if the total consumption is less than f, there might be a point where the charge drops below zero before reaching a message sending moment?

I think if I subtract the charge consumption for each interval before reaching each mi, and ensure that after subtracting the consumption up to mi, there is enough charge to send the message at mi, that should be sufficient.

But in the approach where I subtract the minimum consumption for each interval, and then check if the remaining charge is positive after all intervals, it should cover that.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first test case:

1 3 1 5

3

So, n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

m1=3

So, only one message at moment 3.

From moment 0 to 3:

Option 1: keep the phone on, consume a*3 = 3 units.

Then, at moment 3, send the message with remaining charge 3 - 3 = 0.

But the problem says that if the charge is <=0, it's impossible to send the message.

So, in this case, it's impossible.

Option 2: turn the phone off at moment 0 and on at moment 3, consume b=5 units.

But f=3 < 5, so also impossible.

Hence, output should be "NO", which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

7 21 1 3

4 6 10 13 17 20 26

n=7, f=21, a=1, b=3

m1=4, m2=6, m3=10, m4=13, m5=17, m6=20, m7=26

Calculate the total consumption:

From 0 to 4: min(a*4, b) = min(4,3) = 3

From 4 to 6: min(a*2, b) = min(2,3) = 2

From 6 to 10: min(a*4, b) = min(4,3) = 3

From 10 to 13: min(a*3, b) = min(3,3) = 3

From 13 to 17: min(a*4, b) = min(4,3) = 3

From 17 to 20: min(a*3, b) = min(3,3) = 3

From 20 to 26: min(a*6, b) = min(6,3) = 3

Total consumption: 3+2+3+3+3+3+3 = 17

f=21 - 17 = 4 > 0, so "YES"

Seems correct.

Another test case:

5 10 1 2

1 2 3 4 5

n=5, f=10, a=1, b=2

m1=1, m2=2, m3=3, m4=4, m5=5

From 0 to 1: min(1,2)=1

From 1 to 2: min(1,2)=1

From 2 to 3: min(1,2)=1

From 3 to 4: min(1,2)=1

From 4 to 5: min(1,2)=1

Total consumption: 1*5 = 5

f=10 -5 =5 >0, "YES"

Good.

Another test case:

1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

1000000000

n=1, f=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000

m1=1000000000

From 0 to 1000000000: min(a*1000000000, b) = min(1000000000,1000000000)=1000000000

f=1000000000 -1000000000=0

But charge must be >0 to send the message, so "NO"

Correct.

Another test case:

3 11 9 6

6 8 10

n=3, f=11, a=9, b=6

m1=6, m2=8, m3=10

From 0 to 6: min(9*6,6)= min(54,6)=6

From 6 to 8: min(9*2,6)= min(18,6)=6

From 8 to 10: min(9*2,6)= min(18,6)=6

Total consumption: 6+6+6=18

f=11 -18= -7 <0, "NO"

Correct.

Last test case:

12 621526648 2585904 3566299

51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683

n=12, f=621526648, a=2585904, b=3566299

Calculate the total consumption by summing min(a*(mi+1 - mi), b) for each interval.

Let's compute the intervals and their costs:

From 0 to 51789: min(2585904*51789, 3566299)

2585904*51789 is huge, so min is 3566299

From 51789 to 61859: min(2585904*(61859-51789)=2585904*10070, 3566299)

2585904*10070 is even larger, so min is 3566299

Similarly, for all intervals, since a is 2585904 and the differences between mi are in thousands, a*(mi+1 - mi) will be much larger than b=3566299.

Therefore, for each interval, the min is b=3566299.

There are 12 messages, so 12 intervals.

Total consumption: 12*3566299 = 42795588

f=621526648 -42795588=578731060 >0, "YES"

But according to the sample output, it's "YES", which matches.

So, this approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input(''))

while t > 0:

(n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))

ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))

for i in range(1, n + 1):

f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)

if f > 0:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

t -= 1

This seems to implement exactly what I just described.

It reads t test cases.

For each test case:

- Reads n, f, a, b

- Reads the list of mi, prepends 0 to represent moment 0

- Iterates from 1 to n (messages from m1 to mn)

- For each interval from mi-1 to mi, subtracts the min(a*(mi - mi-1), b) from f

- After processing all intervals, checks if f > 0 and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly

This aligns with my reasoning.

Potential issues to consider:

1. Initial phone state: on at moment 0, which is correctly handled by including 0 in the list.

2. Charge consumption is correctly calculated for each interval.

3. The final check is f > 0, which matches the problem's requirement.

4. Edge cases: n=1, n=2, large values, etc.

5. Integer overflow: the problem mentions that in the last test case, there may be integer overflows, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no issue.

6. Time constraints: with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but since the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, it should be fine.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
