Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position. The tournament works by starting with a match between the first two cows, then the winner continues to match against the next cow in line, and so on. The cow with the higher rating always wins.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets. I have the option to swap my cow with another cow's position exactly once or choose not to swap at all.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses without any swaps. Let's consider the initial setup:

- Cows are in positions 1 to n.

- Matches are sequenced such that the first match is between position 1 and 2, and then the winner faces position 3, and so on.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, the tournament will proceed by the highest-rated cow among the first few cows winning until a higher-rated cow is encountered.

But I can swap my cow k with any other position once to optimize its wins.

I need to find the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve with this option.

Let me consider some examples to grasp this better.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 6, k = 1

ratings = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

If I do nothing:

- Match 1: 12 vs 10 → 12 wins

- Match 2: 12 vs 14 → 14 wins

- No more matches for my cow 1

So, my cow wins once.

But according to the problem, it's optimal to do nothing, and my cow wins once.

In the second test case:

n = 6, k = 5

ratings = [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]

It's optimal to swap cow k (5th, rating 12) with position 3 (rating 727).

After swap:

[7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]

- Match 1: 7 vs 2 → 7 wins

- Match 2: 7 vs 12 → 12 wins

- Match 3: 12 vs 10 → 12 wins

- Match 4: 12 vs 727 → 727 wins

So, my cow wins twice.

Another test case:

n = 2, k = 2

ratings = [1000000000, 1]

If I do nothing:

- Match 1: 1000000000 vs 1 → 1000000000 wins

My cow doesn't win any match.

Is there a better option by swapping?

If I swap k=2 with position 1:

ratings become [1, 1000000000]

- Match 1: 1 vs 1000000000 → 1000000000 wins

Still, my cow doesn't win any match.

So, in this case, the answer is 0.

From these examples, it seems that swapping can sometimes increase the number of wins for my cow, but sometimes it's better not to swap.

I need to find a general strategy to maximize the number of wins for my cow k.

Let me think about the possible approaches.

One way is to simulate the tournament with and without swapping and see which gives more wins for my cow.

But since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

First, let's consider the scenario without any swap.

In the initial positions, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match 1: position 1 vs position 2

- Winner vs position 3

- And so on, until the last position.

My cow k is initially in position k.

I need to see how many matches it can win in this setup.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, my cow can keep winning as long as it has a higher rating than the next cow it faces.

So, in the initial setup, starting from position 1, the cow with the highest rating among positions 1 to current will keep winning until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Similarly, if I swap my cow with another position, I change the initial arrangement, which can potentially allow my cow to face weaker opponents for longer, thus increasing its wins.

I need to find the best position to place my cow to maximize its wins.

Wait, but I can only swap once, meaning I can choose to move my cow to one position, and keep the rest as is.

Or, I can choose not to swap at all.

So, I have two options:

1. Do not swap: simulate the tournament and count how many wins my cow gets in its initial position.

2. Swap my cow to another position and simulate the tournament to count how many wins it gets.

I need to choose the option that gives the maximum number of wins.

But simulating the tournament for each possible swap position is too slow (O(n^2)).

I need a smarter way to calculate the number of wins for my cow in different positions.

Let me think differently.

In the tournament, the process is that the winner of the previous match faces the next cow in line.

So, if I place my cow in a certain position, I need to see how many cows it can defeat before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

Given that all ratings are unique, there is a unique cow with the highest rating, and so on.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the process is effectively finding the number of cows with lower ratings before encountering a cow with a higher rating than my cow.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as finding the number of cows with lower ratings contiguous to my cow's position, in a way that no higher-rated cow interrupts.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that in the tournament sequence, my cow can keep winning as long as it faces cows with lower ratings.

The number of wins is equal to the number of such cows it can defeat before facing a stronger cow.

So, if I place my cow in a certain position, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after it (in the tournament sequence) with lower ratings than my cow, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

But in the tournament structure, it's not exactly a straightforward sliding window, because the opponent changes based on the previous match's winner.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of how many cows have lower ratings than my cow among the cows that my cow would face in the tournament.

But this is getting complicated.

Let me try to find a better approach.

I recall that in tournament problems, especially single-elimination tournaments, the structure can be modeled as a tree, where each match is an edge, and the winner advances.

But in this problem, the tournament is a bit different because it's not a standard single-elimination bracket; it's more like a sequential challenge where the current champion faces the next challenger.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a sequence of matches where the champion accumulates wins until defeated.

Let me consider that the tournament can be seen as the initial cow (or the winner of previous matches) facing the next cow in line.

So, if I place my cow in a certain position, I need to see how many cows it can defeat before it loses.

But the problem is that the champion changes as matches are played, so it's not straightforward.

Maybe I can think in terms of the initial cow or the current champion at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can consider two scenarios:

a) Keep my cow in its original position and see how many wins it gets.

b) Swap my cow to position 1 and see how many wins it gets.

But I'm not sure if this is sufficient, because swapping to position 1 might not always be the best option.

In the second test case, it's better to swap to position 3 rather than position 1.

So, swapping to position 1 might not always yield the maximum wins.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that if I swap my cow to position 1, it becomes the initial champion and can keep winning until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Similarly, if I swap it to another position, say position i, then it will participate in the tournament starting from position i.

Wait, but the tournament always starts from position 1.

Wait, no, the tournament starts with position 1 vs position 2, then the winner vs position 3, and so on.

So, if I swap my cow to position 1, it becomes the initial champion and proceeds to face other cows one by one.

If I swap it to position j, then it would be in position j, and the tournament proceeds as usual.

But it's not straightforward to see how swapping to an arbitrary position j affects my cow's wins.

Perhaps I need to consider where to place my cow such that it faces the weakest possible opponents for as long as possible.

Wait, perhaps placing it later in the sequence allows it to face already weakened opponents.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to formalize the problem.

Let me denote:

- My cow's rating: r_k = a[k-1]

- Other cows' ratings: a[0] to a[n-1], with a[k-1] being my cow.

I can choose to swap my cow with any position i (1 <= i <= n), or choose not to swap.

After swapping, the new sequence is a', and the tournament proceeds as described.

I need to maximize the number of wins for my cow in a'.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the matches are sequenced as follows:

- Match 1: a'[0] vs a'[1], the winner is the one with higher rating.

- Match 2: winner of match 1 vs a'[2], the winner is the one with higher rating.

- And so on, until the last position.

My cow can participate in these matches only if it is the champion at that step.

So, to maximize the number of wins for my cow, I need to position it in such a way that it becomes the champion as early as possible and faces as many lower-rated cows as possible before facing a higher-rated cow.

Wait, but if I place it early, it might get defeated quickly.

Alternatively, if I place it later, it might have to face a already established champion with higher rating.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that the champion at each step is the one with the highest rating among all the cows that have been involved in the matches so far.

Because higher-rated cows always win.

So, the champion will always be the highest-rated cow among the first few cows that have been matched.

Therefore, my cow can only win matches as long as it is the highest-rated cow among the cows it faces.

If I place my cow in a position where there is a higher-rated cow before it, then it can only win if it defeats that higher-rated cow, which it can't because the higher-rated cow would have already defeated it.

Wait, no.

Actually, if there is a higher-rated cow before my cow in the sequence, then that higher-rated cow would have already become the champion before my cow's turn, and my cow would only get to play if the champion faces it, but since the champion has a higher rating, my cow would lose.

Therefore, to maximize my cow's wins, I need to place it after all the cows with higher ratings.

In other words, place it just after the highest-rated cow(s).

Wait, but that might not be straightforward because there can be multiple cows with higher ratings.

Wait, but all ratings are unique, so there is a unique highest-rated cow, a unique second highest, and so on.

Given that, the champion will be the highest-rated cow among the first few cows.

So, if I place my cow after all cows with higher ratings, then it can keep winning against the lower-rated cows until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but in the tournament structure, the champion is the one who has won all previous matches, so it's the highest-rated cow among the first few cows.

Therefore, perhaps the best strategy is to place my cow right after the highest-rated cow, so that my cow can become the champion after the highest-rated cow is eliminated.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that the champion is always the highest-rated cow among those who have been involved in the matches so far.

So, if I place my cow after all higher-rated cows, then it can win against all lower-rated cows until it faces a higher-rated cow.

But in reality, the highest-rated cow will always win and become the final champion.

So, my cow can only win against cows with lower ratings than itself, and it can't beat the higher-rated cows.

Therefore, the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings than itself, minus any higher-rated cows that it has to face before getting to those lower-rated cows.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate how many lower-rated cows are after the highest-rated cow(s) in the sequence.

But I'm getting tangled.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of my cow, say position p.

Then, in the tournament, my cow will be involved in matches starting from match p-1 (since match 0 is between position 0 and 1, match 1 is winner of match 0 vs position 2, and so on).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the tournament progression.

Let me try to simulate the tournament step by step.

Initialize the champion as the cow in position 0.

Then, in each step, the champion faces the next cow in position.

If the champion has a higher rating, it wins and continues.

If the next cow has a higher rating, it becomes the new champion.

This continues until all cows have been faced.

I need to count how many times my cow is the champion and wins against the next cow.

But if I swap my cow to a different position, it changes the sequence.

This seems complicated to simulate for each possible swap.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the champion at step m is the cow with the highest rating among positions 0 to m.

Because higher-rated cows always win.

So, for my cow to become the champion at some point, it needs to be the highest-rated cow among the positions it has faced.

But since all ratings are unique, the true champion is the cow with the highest rating, and it will eventually become the champion.

My cow can only win matches until it faces the true champion.

Therefore, to maximize my cow's wins, I need to position it in such a way that it faces as many lower-rated cows as possible before facing the highest-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps I should place my cow right after the highest-rated cow.

Because then, the highest-rated cow becomes the champion first, and then my cow faces it and loses, but in the process, it has already defeated all the lower-rated cows before it.

Wait, but in that case, my cow would only win once, against the highest-rated cow, but actually, it would lose to the highest-rated cow.

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

If I place my cow right after the highest-rated cow:

- The highest-rated cow defeats the first cow.

- Then, the highest-rated cow faces my cow and defeats it.

So, my cow only wins zero matches.

Wait, that's not good.

Alternatively, if I place my cow after several lower-rated cows and before any higher-rated cows, then it can win against those lower-rated cows.

Wait, perhaps I need to place my cow in a position where there are as many lower-rated cows after it as possible, before encountering a higher-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the position where the number of cows with lower ratings is maximized, and place my cow there.

But I need to consider that the champion is always the highest-rated cow among the first few cows.

Wait, maybe I should place my cow as early as possible, but after all higher-rated cows.

But since all ratings are unique, there is only one cow with higher rating than my cow.

Wait, no, there can be multiple cows with higher ratings.

Wait, actually, since all ratings are unique, there is a unique cow with the highest rating, a unique cow with the second highest, and so on.

So, the champion at any step is the cow with the highest rating among the cows involved so far.

Therefore, my cow can only win against cows with lower ratings than itself, and it will lose to any cow with a higher rating.

So, to maximize its wins, I need to position it such that it faces as many lower-rated cows as possible before facing a higher-rated cow.

Therefore, the ideal position is right after the highest-rated cow.

Because:

- The highest-rated cow becomes the champion first.

- Then, my cow faces the highest-rated cow and loses, but in the process, it has already defeated all lower-rated cows before it.

Wait, but in reality, if I place my cow after the highest-rated cow, it will immediately face the highest-rated cow and lose, without getting a chance to face the lower-rated cows.

Wait, that doesn't sound right.

Let me think again.

Suppose I place my cow at position p.

Then, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match 0: position 0 vs position 1, winner is the higher-rated one.

- Match 1: winner of match 0 vs position 2.

- And so on, until position p.

At each step, the champion is the cow with the highest rating among the cows involved so far.

Therefore, if I place my cow after the highest-rated cow, the highest-rated cow will be the champion, and my cow will face it and lose immediately.

So, in that case, my cow doesn't win any match.

That's not desirable.

Alternatively, if I place my cow before the highest-rated cow but after some lower-rated cows, it can win against those lower-rated cows before facing the highest-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to place my cow in a position where it can defeat all the cows before it, and then lose to the first higher-rated cow after it.

So, the number of wins would be equal to the number of cows with lower ratings before it, minus any higher-rated cows that it has to face first.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the champion at step m is the maximum rating among positions 0 to m.

Therefore, my cow can only win when it is the current champion, which happens when it has the highest rating among the cows involved so far.

But since there are cows with higher ratings, eventually, one of them will become the champion and defeat my cow.

Therefore, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are after it, before encountering a cow with a higher rating than my cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the number of cows with lower ratings that are after my cow's position, before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for a given position p where my cow is placed, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings in positions p+1 to j-1, where j is the position of the first cow with a higher rating than my cow after position p.

In other words, it's the number of lower-rated cows immediately following my cow's position, before encountering a higher-rated cow.

Therefore, to maximize this, I need to choose the position p where this count is maximized.

So, my task reduces to finding the position p where the number of cows with lower ratings after p, before encountering a cow with a higher rating, is maximized.

I need to find the position p that maximizes this count.

Additionally, I have the option to not swap at all, in which case I need to calculate the number of wins for my cow in its original position.

Therefore, I need to calculate:

1. The number of wins if I do not swap.

2. The maximum number of wins over all possible positions p if I swap to position p.

Then, take the maximum of these two.

Now, how do I efficiently compute this?

Given that n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let me first handle the case where I do not swap.

In this case, my cow is at position k.

I need to calculate how many wins it can achieve in the tournament without swapping.

Given the tournament structure, my cow can only win if it is the champion at some point, which requires it to have the highest rating among the cows involved so far.

But in the initial sequence, the champion at each step is the maximum rating among positions 0 to m.

Therefore, my cow can only become the champion if it has the highest rating among positions 0 to k-1.

But since there may be higher-rated cows before it, it may not become the champion.

Wait, actually, in the tournament, the champion is the cow with the highest rating among all the cows that have been matched so far.

So, if there is a cow with higher rating before my cow, then that cow will become the champion and my cow can only win if it faces and defeats that champion, which it can't because the champion has a higher rating.

Therefore, in the initial sequence, my cow can only win if it has the highest rating among all cows before it.

But since all ratings are unique, if there is any cow with higher rating before my cow, my cow can never become the champion.

Therefore, in the initial sequence, if there is any cow with higher rating before position k, then my cow cannot win any matches.

Otherwise, if my cow has the highest rating among positions 1 to k, then it can become the champion and win against the remaining cows until it faces a higher-rated cow.

Wait, but in the tournament structure, the champion is the cow with the highest rating among positions 0 to m.

Therefore, in the initial sequence, my cow can only win if it has the highest rating among positions 0 to k-1.

If it does, then it can become the champion and proceed to win against the remaining cows until it faces a higher-rated cow.

Otherwise, it cannot become the champion and thus cannot win any matches.

Wait, but in the first test case, with n=6, k=1, ratings=[12,10,14,11,8,3], and my cow is at position 1 (index 0), which has rating 12.

In this case, there are no cows before it, so it becomes the initial champion and proceeds to win against position 2 (10), but loses to position 3 (14).

So, it wins once.

In the second test case, n=6, k=5, ratings=[7,2,727,10,12,13], my cow is at position 5 (index 4), with rating 12.

If I do nothing, the tournament proceeds as:

- Match 1: 7 vs 2 → 7 wins

- Match 2: 7 vs 727 → 727 wins

- Match 3: 727 vs 10 → 727 wins

- Match 4: 727 vs 12 → 727 wins

- Match 5: 727 vs 13 → 727 wins

So, my cow never becomes the champion and wins zero matches.

But in the optimal swap, it's better to swap my cow to position 3 (index 2), rating 727.

After swap:

ratings = [7,2,12,10,727,13]

- Match 1: 7 vs 2 → 7 wins

- Match 2: 7 vs 12 → 12 wins

- Match 3: 12 vs 10 → 12 wins

- Match 4: 12 vs 727 → 727 wins

- Match 5: 727 vs 13 → 727 wins

So, my cow at position 5 (rating 727) wins two matches: against 12 and against 13.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's optimal to swap to position 3, but in this simulation, my cow wins two matches.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the problem's second test case, it says swapping to position 3, but in the explanation, it shows swapping to position 3, but in the code, it's swapping to position 3, but in the simulation above, my cow is at position 5 with rating 727, and it wins two matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, in the problem's second test case, it's n=6, k=5, ratings=[7,2,727,10,12,13].

In the explanation, it says swapping cow k (5th, rating 12) with position 3 (rating 727).

After swap:

ratings = [7,2,12,10,727,13]

- Match 1: 7 vs 2 → 7 wins

- Match 2: 7 vs 12 → 12 wins

- Match 3: 12 vs 10 → 12 wins

- Match 4: 12 vs 727 → 727 wins

- Match 5: 727 vs 13 → 727 wins

So, my cow (rating 12) wins two matches.

But in the problem's explanation, it says swapping to position 3, but in this simulation, after swapping to position 3, my cow is at position 3 with rating 12, and the tournament proceeds as above.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with indices.

Let me re-express the positions clearly.

In zero-based indexing:

- Original positions: a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]

- My cow is at position k-1.

In the second test case, n=6, k=5, so my cow is at position 4 (zero-based index 4), with rating 12.

In the explanation, it says swapping cow k (5th, rating 12) with position 3 (rating 727).

So, swapping a[4] and a[2].

After swap:

a = [7,2,12,10,727,13]

Then, the tournament proceeds as above.

So, my cow at position 4 (rating 12) wins two matches.

Wait, but in the problem's explanation, it says swapping to position 3, but in zero-based index, it's position 2.

Anyway, moving on.

I need to find a general way to calculate the maximum number of wins for my cow, considering swapping to any position or not swapping.

From the above thoughts, I need to calculate:

1. The number of wins if I do not swap.

2. The number of wins if I swap my cow to each possible position p, and find the maximum among these.

Then, take the maximum of 1 and 2.

But since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me first focus on calculating the number of wins if I do not swap.

As discussed earlier, in the initial sequence, my cow at position k-1 can only win if it has the highest rating among positions 0 to k-2.

If it does, then it becomes the champion and can proceed to win against the remaining cows until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, to calculate the number of wins without swapping:

- Find the maximum rating among positions 0 to k-2.

- If my cow's rating is higher than this maximum, then it becomes the champion and can win against all the remaining cows until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

- The number of wins is equal to the number of cows it can defeat, which is the number of cows with lower ratings after it, before facing a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but in the tournament structure, it's not exactly that.

Because the champion faces the next cow in sequence one by one.

So, if my cow is the champion, it faces the next cow in sequence, and wins if it has a higher rating.

Therefore, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after it with lower ratings, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, in the initial sequence, if my cow is at position k-1, and it has the highest rating among positions 0 to k-1, then it becomes the champion and can proceed to win against the cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Therefore, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after position k-1 with lower ratings than my cow, until a cow with a higher rating is encountered.

This can be computed by finding the first cow after position k-1 with a higher rating than my cow, and counting the number of cows between position k-1 and this position with lower ratings.

If there are no higher-rated cows after position k-1, then my cow can win against all remaining cows.

Now, for the swapping case, I need to consider swapping my cow to any position p (1 to n), and compute the number of wins in a similar manner.

So, for each possible position p, the number of wins is:

- If p > k-1, then in the new sequence, my cow is at position p, and the cows before it are positions 0 to p-1, with my cow inserted at position p.

- The champion at position p is the maximum among positions 0 to p-1.

- If my cow's rating is higher than this maximum, then it becomes the champion and can proceed to win against the remaining cows until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

- Similarly, if p < k-1, then in the new sequence, my cow is at position p, and the cows before it are positions 0 to p-1.

- Again, if my cow's rating is higher than the maximum among positions 0 to p-1, it becomes the champion and proceeds to win against the remaining cows until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but in reality, when I swap my cow to position p, the sequence becomes:

- Positions 0 to p-1, with my cow at position p.

- The original cow at position p is now at position k-1.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Perhaps a better approach is to consider that after swapping, my cow is at position p, and I need to calculate how many wins it can achieve in the tournament sequence starting from position 0.

Given that, I need to find the number of wins for my cow at position p, which is equal to the number of cows after p with lower ratings than my cow, until encountering a cow with a higher rating than my cow.

Therefore, for each possible position p, the number of wins is:

- Find the first cow after p with a higher rating than my cow.

- The number of wins is the number of cows between p and this position with lower ratings than my cow
