Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position, and they're going to have a tournament. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between the cows in positions 1 and 2. Then, each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line.

The goal is to maximize the number of wins for a specific cow, cow k, and I can choose to swap cow k with any other cow once, or choose not to swap at all.

First, I need to understand how the tournament works. It's like a single-elimination tournament where the winner of each match proceeds to the next one. But in this case, the matches are structured in a specific way: each match after the first is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in the sequence.

Given that all ratings are unique, there are no ties, and the cow with the higher rating always wins.

My task is to strategically place cow k to maximize its wins. I can do this by swapping its position with another cow's position, or leave it as is.

Let's think about the initial setup. The cows are in positions 1 to n, and cow k is in position k.

Option 1: Do nothing, keep cow k in position k.

Option 2: Swap cow k with another cow in some position p, so cow k is now in position p.

I need to consider both options and see which one gives cow k the maximum number of wins.

First, let's consider not swapping. In this case, cow k stays in position k.

I need to simulate the tournament and count how many matches cow k wins.

Similarly, if I choose to swap cow k with another cow in position p, I need to simulate the tournament again and count the wins for cow k in this new arrangement.

Finally, I'll choose the option that gives the maximum wins for cow k.

But simulating the entire tournament for each possible swap would be too time-consuming, especially since n can be up to 10^5 and t can be up to 10^4.

I need a smarter approach.

Let's try to understand the tournament structure.

The first match is between position 1 and 2.

Then, each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in the sequence.

So, the winner of match 1 fights the cow in position 3, then the winner of that fights the cow in position 4, and so on, until all cows have been fought.

Wait, no. Let's read it again.

"The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2.

Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1.

In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match."

So, match 1: pos1 vs pos2, winner is the one with higher rating.

Match 2: winner of match1 vs pos3.

Match 3: winner of match2 vs pos4.

...

Match n-1: winner of match n-2 vs posn.

So, the tournament progresses by having the previous winner face the next cow in the line.

Now, I need to maximize the number of wins for cow k.

Option 1: Do nothing, leave cow k in position k.

Simulate the tournament and count how many times cow k wins.

Option 2: Swap cow k with some other cow p, then simulate the tournament and count how many times cow k wins.

I need to choose the option that gives the maximum wins for cow k.

But simulating for each possible p is not feasible due to time constraints.

I need a better way to calculate the maximum possible wins for cow k.

Let's think about where to place cow k to maximize its wins.

If I place cow k in position 1, it will fight pos2, then the winner fights pos3, and so on.

If I place cow k in position p, it will fight pos1, then the winner fights pos2, and so on, but I need to see how this affects cow k's wins.

Wait, no. If I swap cow k to position p, then in the tournament, cow k will be in position p, and the matches proceed as per the rules.

I need to find a way to calculate the number of wins cow k can achieve from different positions efficiently.

Let me consider the two options separately.

First, without swapping: leave cow k in position k.

Simulate the tournament and count cow k's wins.

Second, with swapping: choose to swap cow k with some position p, and simulate the tournament to count cow k's wins.

Then, choose the maximum of these two.

But again, simulating for each p is not efficient.

I need to find a smarter way to calculate the maximum wins for cow k, considering both options.

Let me consider the properties of the tournament.

Since higher-rated cows always win, the tournament is essentially finding the path of wins starting from position 1 vs position 2, then the winner vs position 3, and so on.

So, the number of wins for cow k depends on its position and the ratings of the cows before it in the sequence.

Wait, more precisely, in the tournament, cow k can only start winning matches if it is the winner of a previous match or if it is in a position that is reached in the sequence of matches.

This seems a bit convoluted.

Maybe I can think in terms of how many cows with higher ratings are before cow k in the sequence.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix cow k in a certain position, say position p.

Then, in the tournament, cow k will participate in the match when it's its turn, i.e., when it's position p's turn in the sequence.

But before that, there are p-1 matches that have to happen, involving positions 1 to p-1.

Cow k will only get to play if it's the winner of the previous matches.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the tournament structure described, the matches are sequential: match 1 is pos1 vs pos2, then match 2 is winner of match1 vs pos3, and so on.

So, cow k, in position p, will only get to play if it's pos p, and the previous match's winner is facing it.

Wait, more carefully:

- Match 1: pos1 vs pos2, winner is the one with higher rating.

- Match 2: winner of match1 vs pos3, winner is the one with higher rating.

- ...

- Match n-1: winner of match n-2 vs posn, winner is the one with higher rating.

So, in this setup, cow k, in position p, will only get to play in match p-1, against the winner of match p-2.

Unless, of course, cow k was the winner of a previous match.

Wait, no.

Actually, if cow k is in position p, it will only get to play in match p-1 against the winner of match p-2.

If cow k wins that match, it will then proceed to match p, against pos p+1, and so on.

Wait, but in this tournament structure, each match involves the winner of the previous match versus the next cow in line.

So, cow k can only participate in the tournament if it is either in position p, or it becomes the winner and proceeds to future matches.

This seems complex to model directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of how many cows have higher ratings than cow k, and their positions.

If cow k has the highest rating among all cows, it will win all matches it participates in, which would be up to position n.

But since ratings are unique, there is only one cow with the highest rating.

If cow k is not the highest, then it will lose to any cow with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve is determined by how many cows with higher ratings are before it in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as follows:

- If cow k is in position p, then it will get to play in match p-1 against the winner of match p-2.

- If cow k has a higher rating than the winner of match p-2, it wins and proceeds to match p, against pos p+1.

- This continues as long as cow k keeps winning against the next cows in the sequence.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of consecutive cows after its position that it can defeat, starting from its own position.

But I need to consider that the winner of the previous matches might be a higher-rated cow, so cow k might not even get to play if a higher-rated cow is already winning.

Wait, no.

Actually, cow k will only get to play in match p-1, against the winner of match p-2.

So, to maximize cow k's wins, I need to place it in a position where:

- The winner of match p-2 has a lower rating than cow k, so cow k can win that match.

- Then, cow k can proceed to win as many subsequent matches as possible.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to think of a better way.

Option 1: Do nothing, leave cow k in position k.

Simulate the tournament and count cow k's wins.

Option 2: Swap cow k with some position p, then simulate the tournament and count cow k's wins.

Choose the maximum of these two.

But again, simulating for each p is not efficient.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner of each match is the cow with the higher rating.

So, the tournament is essentially finding the path of highest-rated cows.

Cow k can only win matches if it is higher-rated than the cows it faces.

If I place cow k in position p, it will face the winner of match p-1.

So, to maximize cow k's wins, I need to place it in a position where:

- The winner of match p-1 has a lower rating than cow k, so cow k can win that match.

- Then, cow k can proceed to win as many subsequent matches as possible.

I need to find the position p where cow k can win the maximum number of matches.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote w(p) as the number of wins cow k can achieve if it is placed in position p.

I need to maximize w(p) over all possible p, including p=k (i.e., not swapping).

How to compute w(p)?

If cow k is in position p, it will first face the winner of match p-1.

If cow k's rating is higher than the winner of match p-1, it wins and proceeds to face the next cow, and so on.

So, w(p) is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that cow k can defeat, starting from p.

But, I need to consider that the winner of match p-1 might have a higher rating than cow k, in which case cow k loses immediately.

So, w(p) = 0 if winner of match p-1 has higher rating than cow k.

Otherwise, w(p) = number of consecutive cows from p to n that cow k can defeat.

Wait, but how do I know who the winner of match p-1 is?

This seems recursive and complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the tournament is a sequence of matches where the winner of each match proceeds to the next one.

So, it's like a linked list: match1 -> match2 -> ... -> match n-1.

Each match's winner is determined by the higher rating.

If I can determine the sequence of matches and who wins each one, I can see how many times cow k wins.

But with n up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Perhaps I can precompute some information about the tournament.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve by placing it in the best possible position.

Let me consider that cow k can only start winning from its own position onwards.

So, if I place cow k in position p, it can win all matches from p onwards where its rating is higher than the next cow's rating.

But, I need to consider that to reach position p, the winner of match p-1 must have a lower rating than cow k.

Otherwise, cow k will lose immediately.

So, w(p) = number of consecutive cows from p to n that cow k can defeat, provided that the winner of match p-1 has a lower rating than cow k.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let's sort the cows by their ratings in descending order.

The highest-rated cow will win all matches it participates in.

The second-highest will win until it faces the highest-rated cow, and so on.

So, for cow k, its number of wins is determined by how many cows with higher ratings are before it in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of cows with higher ratings before cow k in the sequence.

If I can minimize the number of cows with higher ratings before cow k, then cow k can win more matches.

But since I can only swap cow k with one other cow, I need to choose a position where there are fewer cows with higher ratings before it.

Wait, maybe that's a way to approach it.

Let me define:

- Let r_k be the rating of cow k.

- Let S be the sequence of cows' ratings.

- Let S' be the sequence after possibly swapping cow k with another cow.

I need to maximize the number of wins for cow k in S'.

Now, to maximize cow k's wins, I need to maximize the number of cows with lower ratings that cow k can defeat in the tournament.

But given the tournament structure, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the two scenarios:

1. Do not swap: cow k is in position k.

2. Swap cow k with some position p: cow k is in position p.

For each scenario, I need to calculate the number of wins for cow k.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the matches are sequential, and the winner of each match proceeds to the next one.

So, the tournament can be represented as a chain of matches, where each match's winner is determined by the higher rating.

Given that, if I place cow k in position p, I need to see how many matches it can win starting from position p.

But to do that, I need to know who the winner of match p-1 is, which depends on previous matches.

This seems recursive and potentially time-consuming.

Maybe I can find a way to compute, for each position p, who would win if the tournament started from position p.

But that still seems too slow for the given constraints.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix cow k in position p.

Then, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of consecutive cows after position p that it can defeat, starting from p, provided that it wins against the winner of match p-1.

But determining who wins match p-1 is complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider two cases:

- Case 1: cow k is not the winner of any previous match.

- Case 2: cow k is the winner of a previous match.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to look for a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Suppose I have the sequence of cows' ratings.

I can precompute, for each position, who would win if the tournament started from there.

But again, this seems too time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the tournament is essentially finding the maximum rating in the sequence, and the cows with lower ratings lose to higher-rated cows.

But I need to specifically count the number of wins for cow k.

Let me consider that cow k can only win against cows with lower ratings.

So, if I place cow k in position p, it can win against all cows with lower ratings in positions p onwards, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

But I need to consider that to reach position p, the winner of match p-1 must have a lower rating than cow k.

Otherwise, cow k loses immediately.

So, the number of wins for cow k in position p is:

- 0, if the winner of match p-1 has a higher rating than cow k.

- Otherwise, the number of consecutive cows from p to n that have lower ratings than cow k.

This seems manageable.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me try to think about the winner of match p-1.

The winner of match p-1 is the winner of the match between the winner of match p-2 and cow in position p.

But this seems recursive.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the winner for each prefix of the sequence.

Let me try to think differently.

Let's consider that in the tournament, the matches are:

Match 1: pos1 vs pos2.

Winner of match1 vs pos3 (match2).

Winner of match2 vs pos4 (match3).

...

Winner of match n-2 vs posn (match n-1).

So, the winner of each match is determined by the higher rating.

Therefore, the winner of match i is the higher-rated cow between the winner of match i-1 and pos i+1.

So, the winner of match p-1 is the higher-rated cow between the winner of match p-2 and pos p.

And so on.

This seems too recursive to handle efficiently.

Maybe I need to consider that the winner of match p-1 is the maximum rating among pos1 to pos p.

Because each match is between the previous winner and the next cow, and the higher-rated cow wins.

So, the winner of match p-1 is the maximum rating among pos1 to pos p.

Is that correct?

Let me check with an example.

Suppose n=4, positions: pos1, pos2, pos3, pos4.

Match1: pos1 vs pos2, winner is max(pos1, pos2).

Match2: winner of match1 vs pos3, which is max(max(pos1, pos2), pos3).

Match3: winner of match2 vs pos4, which is max(max(max(pos1, pos2), pos3), pos4).

So, indeed, the winner of match p-1 is the maximum rating among pos1 to pos p.

Therefore, the winner of match p-1 is the maximum rating among pos1 to pos p.

So, if cow k is in position p, to win match p-1, it needs to have a higher rating than the maximum rating among pos1 to pos p-1.

Wait, no.

Actually, the winner of match p-1 is the maximum rating among pos1 to pos p.

So, if cow k is in position p, to win match p-1, it needs to have a higher rating than the winner of match p-2, which is the maximum rating among pos1 to pos p-1.

So, to win match p-1, cow k needs to have a higher rating than the maximum rating among pos1 to pos p-1.

If it does, then it wins match p-1 and proceeds to match p, where it faces pos p+1.

It can continue winning as long as its rating is higher than the ratings of the subsequent cows.

Therefore, if cow k is in position p, the number of wins it can achieve is:

- 0, if its rating is lower than or equal to the maximum rating among pos1 to pos p-1.

- Otherwise, the number of consecutive cows from position p to n that it can defeat, which is the number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than cow k.

Because cow k will keep winning against cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but since all ratings are unique, it will keep winning until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, in this case, if cow k is in position p, and its rating is higher than the maximum rating among pos1 to pos p-1, then it can win against all cows with lower ratings in positions p to n.

Otherwise, it cannot even win match p-1.

Therefore, for each position p, w(p) can be computed as:

if a_k > max(a[1] to a[p-1]), then w(p) = number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than a_k.

else, w(p) = 0.

So, to maximize w(p), I need to choose p such that:

- p is the smallest possible position where a_k > max(a[1] to a[p-1]).

- And then, the number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than a_k is maximized.

Wait, but since a_k is fixed, the number of cows with lower ratings is fixed.

So, I need to choose p such that:

- p is the earliest position where a_k > max(a[1] to a[p-1]).

- And then, the number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than a_k is maximized.

But since the number of cows with lower ratings is fixed, the position p should be as early as possible where a_k > max(a[1] to a[p-1]).

Because the earlier p is, the more cows it can potentially defeat.

But I need to consider that if I swap cow k with some other position p, I need to make sure that in the new sequence, a_k > max(a[1] to a[p-1]).

Wait, but in the new sequence, if I swap cow k with position p, then pos p has a_k, and the other cows are rearranged accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of choosing p such that:

- In the original sequence, if I swap cow k to position p, then in the new sequence, pos1 to pos p-1 are the original cows except that pos p is now cow k.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me denote:

- Original sequence: a1, a2, ..., an.

- If I swap cow k with position p, then the new sequence is:

  - pos1 to pos p-1: unchanged.

  - pos p: a_k.

  - pos p+1 to pos n: unchanged, but with a_k removed from its original position.

Wait, yes, because I'm swapping cow k with position p.

So, in the new sequence:

- pos p: a_k.

- pos k: original pos p's rating.

- All other positions remain the same.

Wait, no.

If I swap cow k with position p, then:

- Cow k goes to position p.

- The cow that was originally in position p goes to position k.

So, in the new sequence:

- pos p: a_k.

- pos k: a_p.

- All other positions remain the same.

Now, in this new sequence, I need to simulate the tournament and count how many matches cow k wins.

But this is still complicated.

Perhaps I can consider that in the new sequence, cow k is in position p, and I can compute w(p) as described earlier.

So, for each possible p, w(p) = 0 if a_k <= max(a[1] to a[p-1]), else w(p) = number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than a_k.

Then, the maximum number of wins for cow k is the maximum of w(p) over all p from 1 to n, including p=k (no swap).

But I need to compute this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

So, for each test case, I need to compute the maximum w(p) over p from 1 to n in O(n) time.

Let me see.

First, for each p, w(p) = 0 if a_k <= max(a[1] to a[p-1]), else w(p) = number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than a_k.

So, I need to find, for each p, whether a_k > max(a[1] to a[p-1]).

And if so, count the number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than a_k.

Then, take the maximum over all p.

To compute this efficiently, I can precompute two arrays:

1. prefix_max[p] = max(a[1] to a[p-1]).

2. suffix_count[rating] = number of cows from position p to n with rating < rating.

Wait, but suffix_count needs to be for a specific p.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the cows and use some kind of prefix sum.

But let's think step by step.

First, compute prefix_max[p] = max(a[1] to a[p-1]).

This can be done in O(n) time.

Then, for each p, if a_k > prefix_max[p], then w(p) = number of cows from p to n with rating < a_k.

Else, w(p) = 0.

Now, I need to compute, for each p, the number of cows from p to n with rating < a_k, but only if a_k > prefix_max[p].

But this seems inefficient if done naively.

Wait, perhaps I can find the smallest p such that a_k > prefix_max[p], and then for that p, find the number of cows from p to n with rating < a_k.

But I need to maximize w(p), which is the number of cows from p to n with rating < a_k, under the condition that a_k > prefix_max[p].

Wait, actually, to maximize w(p), I need to choose p such that a_k > prefix_max[p], and then maximize the number of cows from p to n with rating < a_k.

Given that, perhaps I can find the smallest p such that a_k > prefix_max[p], and then find the maximum number of cows from p to n with rating < a_k.

But I need to consider all possible p where a_k > prefix_max[p], and choose the p that maximizes the number of cows from p to n with rating < a_k.

Wait, but smaller p generally allows for more possible wins, but it depends on the ratings of the cows from p to n.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I can iterate through p from 1 to n, keep track of prefix_max[p], and for each p where a_k > prefix_max[p], keep track of the number of cows from p to n with rating < a_k, and keep the maximum.

But with n up to 10^5, I need this to be efficient.

I can precompute the prefix_max array in O(n) time.

Then, I can sort the cows from position p to n based on their ratings, and use a prefix sum to count the number of cows with rating < a_k.

Wait, but sorting would take O(n log n), which is too slow for the constraints.

I need a better way.

Wait, since all ratings are unique, I can precompute for each p, the number of cows from p to n with rating < a_k.

I can do this by iterating from n to 1, keeping track of the number of cows with rating < a_k seen so far.

This way, I can compute the suffix_count[p] = number of cows from p to n with rating < a_k in O(n) time.

Then, for each p, if a_k > prefix_max[p], then w(p) = suffix_count[p], else w(p) = 0.

Then, the maximum w(p) over p from 1 to n is the answer.

Wait, but I need to consider that when I swap cow k with position p, the rating at position p becomes a_k, and the rating at position k becomes the original rating of position p.

So, in the new sequence, the ratings are:

- pos p: a_k.

- pos k: a_p.

- All other positions remain the same.

Therefore, when computing prefix_max[p], I need to consider the new sequence after the swap.

This complicates things.

Wait, I need to consider that swapping cow k with position p affects the ratings in positions p and k.

So, in the new sequence, pos p has a_k, and pos k has a_p.

Therefore, when computing prefix_max[p], I need to consider that pos p now has a_k.

This seems tricky to handle for all possible p.

Maybe I need to consider two cases:

1. Do not swap: keep cow k in position k.

2. Swap cow k with some position p: place cow k in position p, and place pos p's cow in position k.

Then, for each case, compute w(p) as described earlier.

Finally, choose the maximum w(p) over all p.

But again, this seems too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that in the new sequence after swapping, the ratings are:

- pos1 to pos p-1: unchanged.

- pos p: a_k.

- pos p+1 to pos n: unchanged, except that pos k now has a_p.

Wait, no.

Actually, after swapping cow k with position p:

- pos p: a_k.

- pos k: a_p.

- All other positions remain the same.

So, in the new sequence, pos1 to pos n are:

- pos1: a1.

- ...

- pos p: a_k.

- ...

- pos k: a_p.

- ...

- pos n: a_n.

Now, to compute prefix_max[p], I need to consider the maximum of a1 to a[p-1] in this new sequence.

But since only pos p and pos k are swapped, the prefix_max[p] depends on whether p < k or p > k.

Wait, perhaps I can consider two scenarios:

- If p < k: then in the new sequence, pos p has a_k, and pos k has a_p.

So, for p < k:

prefix_max[p] = max(a1 to a[p-1]) in the original sequence, but with pos p being a_k.

Wait, no, pos p is now a_k, but pos k is now a_p.

So, for p < k:

prefix_max[p] = max(a1 to a[p-1], a_k).

Because pos p has a_k, and pos p is after p-1.

Wait, no.

Actually, for p < k:

prefix_max[p] = max(a1 to a[p-1], a_k), because pos p is now a_k.

Similarly, for p > k:

prefix_max[p] = max(a1 to a[p-1]), where pos k has a_p.

Wait, this is getting messy.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in the new sequence after swapping cow k with position p:

- The sequence is:

  - pos1 to pos p-1: original a1 to a[p-1].

  - pos p: a_k.

  - pos p+1 to pos k-1: original a[p+1] to a[k-1].

  - pos k: a_p.

  - pos k+1 to pos n: original a[k+1] to a[n].

So, in the new sequence, pos p is a_k, and pos k is a_p.

Therefore, to compute prefix_max[p] in the new sequence:

- For p <= k:

  - prefix_max[p] = max(a1 to a[p-1], a_k).

- For p > k:

  - prefix_max[p] = max(a1 to a[p-1]), where a[k] is now a_p.

Wait, this is still complicated.

Perhaps I need to split the computation based on whether p < k, p = k, or p > k.

But this seems too involved.

Let me consider that the impact of swapping cow k with position p is:

- In the new sequence, pos p has a_k, and pos k has a_p.

- So, for p < k:

  - prefix_max[p] = max(a1 to a[p-1], a_k).

- For p > k:

  - prefix_max[p] = max(a1 to a[p-1]), with a[k] being a_p.

This is still too convoluted.

Maybe I need to consider that only the positions up to p are affected by the swap if p < k, and so on.

This seems too time-consuming to figure out.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings than cow k, minus the number of cows with higher ratings before it in the sequence.

Wait, but I can swap cow k once to optimize its position.

So, perhaps I can calculate the number of cows with lower ratings than cow k, which is fixed, and then find the best position p to place cow k such that:

- The number of cows with higher ratings before p is minimized.

Because if there are no cows with higher ratings before p, then cow k can win all matches from p onwards against cows with lower ratings.

But if there are cows with higher ratings before p, cow k will lose immediately.

Therefore, to maximize cow k's wins, I should place it in a position p such that:

- p is the smallest position where a_k > max(a1 to a[p-1]).

- Then, cow k can win against all cows with lower ratings from p to n.

So, the number of wins is the number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than a_k.

But I need to maximize this.

Given that, I need to choose p such that p is as small as possible where a_k > max(a1 to a[p-1]), and then count the number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than a_k.

But I also need to consider that if I choose p > k, the swap affects the position of the cow originally at position p.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix cow k in position p.

Then, to maximize its wins, I need to ensure that it faces as few higher-rated cows as possible before it.

Since the tournament progresses by having the winner face the next cow, the only way cow k can start winning is if it is in a position where the winner of the previous matches has a lower rating than cow k.

Given that, perhaps the best strategy is to place cow k as early as possible where its rating is higher than all previous cows.

In other words, find the smallest p such that a_k > max(a1 to a[p-1]).

Then, from position p, cow k can proceed to win against all cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, in this case, the number of wins is the number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than a_k.

To maximize this, I need to choose p as small as possible where a_k > max(a1 to a[p-1]).

But I also need to consider that if I swap cow k with position p, I need to make sure that in the new sequence, a_k is in position p, and the cow originally in position p is moved to position k.

This affects the prefix_max calculation.

This seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to consider that the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings than cow k, minus the number of cows with higher ratings before it in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the position where cow k is placed such that it avoids higher-rated cows before it.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

Sample Input:

3

6 1

12 10 14 11 8 3

6 5

7 2 727 10 12 13

2 2

1000000000 1

Sample Output:

1

2

0

In the first test case, n=6, k=1.

Original sequence: 12,10,14,11,8,3.

Cow k=1 has rating 12.

Option 1: Do nothing.

Tournament:

Match1: pos1 (12) vs pos2 (10), winner is 12.

Match2: winner (12) vs pos3 (14), winner is 14.

Match3: winner (14) vs pos4 (11), winner is 14.

Match4: winner (14) vs pos5 (8), winner is 14.

Match5: winner (14) vs pos6 (3), winner is 14.

Cow k=1 wins only match1.

So, wins=1.

Option 2: Swap cow k=1 with some position p.

For example, swap with p=3:

New sequence: 14,10,12,11,8,3.

Tournament:

Match1: pos1 (14) vs pos2 (10), winner is 14.

Match2: winner (14) vs pos3 (12), winner is 14.

Match3: winner (14) vs pos4 (11), winner is 14.

Match4: winner (14) vs pos5 (8), winner is 14.

Match5: winner (14) vs pos6 (3), winner is 14.

Cow k=1 (rating 12) doesn't win any matches because it's not in the sequence anymore; it's now in position p=3 with rating 12, but the winner is always 14.

Wait, no.

Wait, in this swap, cow k=1 (rating 12) is swapped with pos p=3 (rating 14).

So, new sequence: pos1=12, pos2=10, pos3=14, pos4=11, pos5=8, pos6=3.

Tournament:

Match1: pos1 (12) vs pos2 (10), winner is 12.

Match2: winner (12) vs pos3 (14), winner is 14.

Match3: winner (14) vs pos4 (11), winner is 14.

Match4: winner (14) vs pos5 (8), winner is 14.

Match5: winner (14) vs pos6 (3), winner is 14.

So, cow k=1 (now in pos1 with rating 12) wins only match1.

Same as option 1.

Another swap, say p=4:

New sequence: pos1=11, pos2=10, pos3=14, pos4=12, pos5=8, pos6=3.

Tournament:

Match1: pos1 (11) vs pos2 (10), winner is 11.

Match2: winner (11) vs pos3 (14), winner is 14.

Match3: winner (14) vs pos4 (12), winner is 14.

Match4: winner (14) vs pos5 (8), winner is 14.

Match5: winner (14) vs pos6 (3), winner is 14.

Cow k=1 (now in pos4 with rating 12) doesn't win any matches.

Wait, no.

Wait, in this swap, cow k=1 (rating 12) is swapped with pos p=4 (rating 11).

So, new sequence: pos1=12, pos2=10, pos3=14, pos4=11, pos5=8, pos6=3.

Tournament:

Match1: pos1 (12) vs pos2 (10), winner is 12.

Match2: winner (12) vs pos3 (14), winner is 14.

Match3: winner (14) vs pos4 (11), winner is 14.

Match4: winner (14) vs pos5 (8), winner is 14.

Match5: winner (14) vs pos6 (3), winner is 14.

So, cow k=1 (now in pos4 with rating 11) doesn't win any matches.

Worse than option 1.

Another swap, say p=5:

New sequence: pos1=8, pos2=10, pos3=14, pos4=11, pos5=12, pos6=3.

Tournament:

Match1: pos1 (8) vs pos2 (10), winner is 10.

Match2: winner (10) vs pos3 (14), winner is 14.

Match3: winner (14) vs pos4 (11), winner is 14.

Match4: winner (14) vs pos5 (12), winner is 14.

Match5: winner (14) vs pos6 (3), winner is 14.

Cow k=1 (now in pos5 with rating 12) doesn't win any matches.

Worse than option 1.

Another swap, say p=6:

New sequence: pos1=3, pos2=10, pos3=14, pos4=11, pos5=8, pos6=12.

Tournament:

Match1: pos1 (3) vs pos2 (10), winner is 10.

Match2: winner (10) vs pos3 (14), winner is 14.

Match3: winner (14) vs pos4 (11), winner is 14.

Match4: winner (14) vs pos5 (8), winner is 14.
