Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints, which is good to know.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], some of its subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], and [1,2,3].

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. Since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and the constraints on n are up to 10^6, it seems like the sequence elements might need to be carefully chosen to cover all the sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

Let me consider the properties of the sequence that allow me to generate sums from 1 to n, except for k.

One way to generate a lot of different sums is to use powers of 2 because they can represent any number through their combinations. For example, the sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, ...] can sum up to any number by including or excluding appropriate elements.

However, in this problem, I need to exclude the sum k. So, I need to modify this approach to ensure that no subsequence sums to k, while still being able to sum to all other values from 1 to n.

Let me think about how to exclude the sum k. One idea is to remove the elements that would allow the sum k to be formed. But I need to do this in a way that doesn't prevent me from forming other sums.

Another approach is to include elements that cover all sums except k. Maybe I can find a minimal set of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

Given that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and considering that 2^25 is over 33 million, which is larger than n (which can be up to 10^6), it seems feasible to use a subset of powers of 2, with some adjustments.

Let me consider the binary representation of k. Since sums of subsets of powers of 2 correspond to the binary representation of numbers, maybe I can manipulate the sequence to avoid the sum k.

Suppose I have the sequence as powers of 2 up to the highest power that is less than or equal to n. For example, if n is 10, I would have [1, 2, 4, 8]. This allows me to sum up to any number from 1 to 15, but I need to cover up to n=10, excluding k.

But if k is, say, 5, then I need to modify this sequence so that no subsequence sums to 5, but still sums to all other values from 1 to 10.

One way to avoid the sum 5 is to remove one of the elements that contribute to it. For example, in [1,2,4,8], the sum 5 is achieved by 1+4. So, if I remove 4, then 5 cannot be formed. However, removing 4 would also prevent me from forming sums that require 4, like 4 itself, 6 (2+4), 7 (1+2+4), etc. That would interfere with condition 2, which requires that all other sums from 1 to n (except k) can be formed.

So, removing elements isn't a good approach because it would restrict too many sums.

Another idea is to include elements that allow multiple ways to form sums, so that even if one combination is blocked, others can still form the required sums.

Maybe I can include redundant elements or elements that are not pure powers of 2 to have more flexibility.

Let me consider the example from the problem:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Looking at the first test case:

n=2, k=2

Sequence: [1]

This satisfies because:

- No subsequence sums to 2.

- There is a subsequence that sums to 1.

Second test case:

n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

- No subsequence sums to 1 (since all elements are >=2).

- Can sum to 2,3,4,5,6.

Third test case:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- Sums can be from 1 to 7, but not 8.

Fourth test case:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

- Need to check if no subsequence sums to 3.

- And all other sums from 1 to 9, except 3, can be formed.

Similarly, for n=10, k=7, sequence [1,2,8,3] is provided.

From these examples, it seems that the sequence doesn't necessarily have to consist of distinct elements; duplicates are allowed.

I need to find a general approach to construct such a sequence with at most 25 elements.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements needed to cover all sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

If I use the standard binary approach with powers of 2, I can cover all sums from 1 to n with log2(n) elements. But I need to exclude k.

Maybe I can modify the sequence by replacing or adjusting some elements to exclude the sum k.

Another idea is to include elements that sum up to all required v, but ensure that no combination sums to k.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can think in terms of inclusion-exclusion or some greedy approach.

Let me consider building the sequence step by step, starting with the smallest elements.

Initialize an empty sequence a.

Start with the smallest missing sum and add an element that helps achieve that sum.

But I need to ensure that k is not achievable.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of a minimal set that covers all sums except k.

I recall that with a set of coins of certain denominations, you can make certain amounts. This is similar to the coin problem, where the goal is to select denominations that can sum up to certain amounts but not others.

In particular, this resembles the concept of a subset sum problem, which is NP-complete in general. However, since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6, I need an efficient way to construct such a sequence.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Start with the smallest possible elements to cover the sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

2. Use a greedy algorithm to select elements that allow me to cover as much of the required sums as possible without allowing the sum k.

But I need to ensure that the sequence doesn't exceed 25 elements.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that 25 is a small number and try to find a sequence that covers all sums except k.

Another idea: since the sequence can have up to 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6, I need to choose elements that are large enough to cover the higher sums efficiently.

Let me consider including k itself in the sequence. Wait, no, because any subsequence that includes k would sum to at least k, but I need to ensure that no subsequence sums exactly to k.

Wait, no, including k would allow the subsequence consisting of just k to sum to k, which is not allowed. So, k cannot be in the sequence.

Wait, but the problem allows non-negative integers, so zero is allowed. Including zero wouldn't help in forming new sums, as it doesn't change the sum.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the binary representation again.

Suppose I have the sequence as powers of 2: [1,2,4,8,...].

This can sum up to any number up to the sum of the sequence.

But I need to exclude the sum k.

So, perhaps I can modify the sequence by removing or adjusting certain elements to prevent the sum k from being formed.

However, as I saw in the earlier example, removing an element might prevent too many sums.

Alternatively, maybe I can include an element that makes some sums redundant.

Wait, perhaps I can include an element that is equal to k plus some other value, but that seems convoluted.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can sum to all values from 1 to n, except k.

This is similar to the entire set of numbers from 1 to n, excluding the subsets that sum to k.

But that's not helpful for constructing a small sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the sequence can have duplicates.

For example, in the third test case, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which sums to any value from 1 to 7, but not 8.

This is a way to cover all sums up to 7 by having multiple 1's.

But for larger n, this approach isn't efficient, as I'd need too many 1's.

I need a better way.

Let me consider splitting the range [1,n] into parts and constructing sequences for each part.

But that seems complicated.

Another idea: since the sequence can have up to 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6, perhaps I can use a combination of small and large elements to cover the required sums efficiently.

For example, include small elements to cover the lower sums and larger elements to cover the higher sums.

But I still need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

This is getting tricky.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

It says that for each test case, I need to output m (1 <= m <= 25), followed by m integers a_i (0 <= a_i <= 10^9).

So, the elements can be quite large, up to 10^9.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and m is at most 25, perhaps I can use a sequence that includes elements that are powers of 2, but adjust it to exclude k.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that with m elements, I can generate up to 2^m - 1 different sums.

But 2^25 is over 33 million, which is more than enough for n up to 10^6.

So, in theory, 25 elements should be sufficient to cover all sums up to 10^6.

But I need to exclude k.

Let me consider constructing a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except k, using at most 25 elements.

One possible approach is to start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude k.

For example, start with the sequence of powers of 2 up to the highest power less than or equal to n.

Then, adjust the sequence to prevent the sum k from being formed.

But how?

One way is to remove the elements that, when combined, can form k.

But as I saw earlier, removing elements might prevent too many sums.

Alternatively, maybe I can replace some elements with others to block the sum k.

Wait, perhaps I can include an element that is equal to k minus some other element, so that it cancels out.

This sounds complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except k.

This means that the set of all possible subset sums of a is equal to {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

I need to find such a sequence a with at most 25 elements.

Given that, perhaps I can look for a minimal set a that generates all sums except k.

But finding such a minimal set seems non-trivial.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the sequence can contain duplicates.

For example, if I have multiple copies of the same number, I can form multiple sums.

But I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to k.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix a sequence a, and I want to check if it satisfies the conditions.

To check if there is no subsequence that sums to k, and that for all v != k, there exists a subsequence that sums to v.

But checking all possible subsets is exponential, which is not feasible.

So, I need a smarter way to construct the sequence.

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient algorithm.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, I see that for n=2, k=2, the sequence is [1].

For n=6, k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6].

For n=8, k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1].

For n=9, k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1].

For n=10, k=7, the sequence is [1,2,8,3].

From these examples, it seems that:

- If k=1, then all elements can be greater than 1, so no subsequence sums to 1.

- If k is larger, I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k, while still covering other sums.

In the third example, with k=8 and n=8, using seven 1's allows sums from 1 to 7, but not 8.

But for larger n, this approach isn't efficient.

In the fourth example, with n=9 and k=3, the sequence [7,1,4,1] doesn't sum to 3, but can sum to other values up to 9.

Similarly, in the fifth example, [1,2,8,3] doesn't sum to 7, but sums to other values up to 10.

I need to find a general method to construct such sequences.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a base sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, such as [1,2,4,8,...].

- Then, adjust the sequence to prevent the sum k from being formed.

To prevent the sum k from being formed, I need to ensure that no combination of elements in a sums to k.

But how?

One idea is to find the minimal set of elements that can generate all sums except k.

Given that m is at most 25, I can try to find a set of 25 elements that cover all required sums.

But this seems too broad.

Let me think about the binary representation again.

Suppose I have the sequence as powers of 2: [1,2,4,8,16,...].

This can generate any sum up to the sum of the sequence.

To exclude k, I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

One way to do this is to remove the elements that, when combined, can form k.

But as I saw earlier, this might remove too much.

Wait, perhaps I can remove the specific combination that forms k and adjust the sequence accordingly.

But identifying and removing specific combinations seems inefficient.

Another idea: include elements that are just enough to cover the required sums.

For example, if k is small, I can include elements that cover sums above k but not k itself.

But this doesn't seem straightforward.

Let me consider the case where k=1.

In this case, I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, but can sum to any v from 2 to n.

This is straightforward: just include elements greater than or equal to 2.

For example, [2] can sum to 2, but not 1.

Or, for n=6, k=1, the sequence [2,3,4,5,6] can sum to any v from 2 to 6, but not 1.

Similarly, for k=8 and n=8, using seven 1's allows sums from 1 to 7, but not 8.

Wait, but in that case, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which sums to any number from 1 to 7, but not 8.

This seems like a different approach: using multiple 1's to cover sums from 1 to m, where m < k.

But for larger n, this isn't efficient.

In the fourth example, with n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1].

Let's see what sums can be formed:

- Subsets:

- 7: 7

- 1: 1

- 4: 4

- 1: 1

- 7+1=8

- 7+4=11

- 7+1+4=12

- 1+1=2

- 1+4=5

- 1+1+4=6

- 7+1+1=9

So, possible sums: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12.

Excludes 3.

Similarly, for n=10 and k=7, sequence [1,2,8,3]:

- Subsets:

- 1:1

- 2:2

- 8:8

- 3:3

- 1+2=3

- 1+8=9

- 1+3=4

- 2+8=10

- 2+3=5

- 8+3=11

- 1+2+8=11

- 1+2+3=6

- 1+8+3=12

- 2+8+3=13

- 1+2+8+3=14

Possible sums:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

Excludes 7.

Wait, but in the fourth example, with k=3, the sequence includes two 1's, which allow sum 2 (1+1), and sum 3 (1+2 or 1+1+1), but according to the output, it's [7,1,4,1], which seems to exclude sum 3.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, it includes sum 3.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Let's recalculate the subsets for [7,1,4,1]:

- Subsets:

- 7:7

- 1:1

- 4:4

- 1:1

- 7+1=8

- 7+4=11

- 7+1+4=12

- 1+1=2

- 1+4=5

- 1+1+4=6

- 7+1+1=9

- 7+4+1=12

- 1+4+1=6

- 7+1+4+1=13

So, sums:1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13.

Excludes 3.

Wait, but earlier I thought 1+2=3, but in this sequence, there is no 2.

Wait, in this sequence, elements are [7,1,4,1], so the possible sums are as above, excluding 3.

So, how was sum 3 achieved in my earlier analysis? Oh, I mistakenly included 2 in the earlier list, but in this sequence, there is no 2.

Wait, in [7,1,4,1], the possible sums are:

- 1

- 4

- 7

- 1 (again)

- 1+1=2

- 1+4=5

- 1+7=8

- 1+4+1=6

- 1+7+1=9

- 4+7=11

- 1+4+7=12

- 1+1+4+7=13

So, indeed, no sum equals 3.

Hence, this sequence works for n=9, k=3.

Similarly, for n=10, k=7, sequence [1,2,8,3]:

- Sums:

- 1

- 2

- 8

- 3

- 1+2=3

- 1+8=9

- 1+3=4

- 2+8=10

- 2+3=5

- 8+3=11

- 1+2+8=11

- 1+2+3=6

- 1+8+3=12

- 2+8+3=13

- 1+2+8+3=14

So, sums:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

Excludes 7.

Hence, works.

So, in both cases, the sequences exclude the sum k while including sums from 1 to n, except k.

Now, I need to generalize this approach.

Looking at these examples, it seems that including certain elements that cover the required sums while avoiding k is possible.

But how to systematically construct such a sequence?

Let me consider that the sequence should cover all sums from 1 to n, except k.

One way to think about it is to have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude the sum k.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that allow generating all sums except k by carefully choosing their values.

Another idea: since the sequence can have duplicates, I can include multiple small elements to cover the lower sums.

For example, including multiple 1's allows covering sums from 1 up to the number of 1's.

But for larger sums, I need larger elements.

In the third example, with k=8 and n=8, using seven 1's covers sums from 1 to 7.

But for larger n, say n=10^6, using a million 1's isn't practical, as m is limited to 25.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that with m elements, I can cover up to 2^m - 1 sums.

With m=25, that's over 33 million sums, which is more than enough for n=10^6.

So, in theory, it's possible.

But how to choose the elements?

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with the sequence of powers of 2 up to the highest power less than or equal to n.

- If the sum k can be formed with this sequence, adjust the sequence to prevent it.

- Ensure that all other sums from 1 to n, except k, can still be formed.

For example, for n=2, k=2:

- Powers of 2: [1,2]

- This can sum to 1 and 2.

- But I need to exclude sum 2.

- So, remove 2: sequence [1]

- Now, can sum to 1, but not 2.

Similarly, for n=6, k=1:

- Powers of 2: [1,2,4]

- Can sum to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

- Need to exclude sum 1.

- So, remove 1: sequence [2,4]

- Now, can sum to 2,4,6, but not 1.

- But need to cover 2,3,4,5,6.

- With [2,4], can't sum to 3,5.

- So, this doesn't work.

- Hence, need a different approach.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=6, k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6].

- Sums:2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.

- Excludes 1.

- Covers 2 to 6.

Hence, it works.

But this sequence has 5 elements, which is within the limit of 25.

But for larger n, this approach isn't efficient.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the binary representation again.

Suppose I have the sequence as powers of 2: [1,2,4,8,...].

This can sum to any number up to the sum of the sequence.

To exclude sum k, perhaps I can find the binary representation of k and remove the necessary elements.

Wait, but as seen earlier, removing elements might prevent too many sums.

Alternatively, maybe I can replace some elements to block the sum k.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=9, k=3.

Binary representation of 3 is 11, which is 1+2.

So, in the sequence [1,2,4], the sum 1+2=3.

To prevent this sum, I can remove one of them, but that would prevent sums that require that element.

Alternatively, maybe I can replace 2 with another number that doesn't allow sum 3.

For example, replace 2 with 3.

Sequence: [1,3,4].

- Sums:1,3,4,5,7.

- Missing 2,6,8,9.

- Not covering all sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

Not good.

Another idea: include elements that are greater than k, and adjust smaller elements accordingly.

But I'm not making progress.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix the sequence a, and I need to ensure that the subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a system of equations or use some properties of subset sums.

But this seems too abstract.

Let me consider that the problem states t=1000 test cases, with sum of n over all test cases <=10^7.

Hence, an O(n log n) solution per test case would be acceptable, but since n can be up to 10^6, I need something faster.

Wait, but m is at most 25, so perhaps I can iterate over possible sequences of up to 25 elements.

But that's not feasible for n up to 10^6.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that with m elements, I can cover up to 2^m -1 sums.

Given m=25, that's over 33 million, which is more than enough for n=10^6.

Hence, it's possible.

But how to choose those m elements optimally?

Another idea: use a greedy approach to select elements that cover as much of the required sums as possible without allowing sum k.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Let me think about the following plan:

- Initialize an empty sequence a.

- Initialize a set of required sums: {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

- While there are required sums left:

- Choose the smallest required sum s.

- Add s to the sequence a.

- Remove all sums that can be formed by adding s to already covered sums.

- Ensure that k is not included in the covered sums.

But this seems too simplistic and might not prevent sum k from being formed.

Moreover, it's not clear how to implement this efficiently.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the sequence a should generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

Hence, the set of all subset sums of a should be equal to {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

Given that, perhaps I can find a minimal set a that generates exactly these sums.

But finding such a minimal set seems difficult.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the sequence can have up to 25 elements, and n is up to 10^6, but t is up to 1000, with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7.

Hence, I need an efficient solution per test case.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can precompute a sequence that works for that n and k.

But how?

Let me consider that for k=1, the sequence can consist of elements >=2, covering sums from 2 to n.

For k=2, I need to exclude sum 2, but cover sums from 1 and 3 to n.

And so on.

But this seems case-specific.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix the sequence a, and I represent the subset sums as the convolution of the sequence elements.

But manipulating convolutions to exclude a specific sum seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can use generating functions.

The generating function for the sequence a is the product of (1 + x^{a_i}) for each a_i in a.

I need this generating function to have coefficients 1 for all v from 1 to n except v=k, where the coefficient should be 0.

But manipulating generating functions to achieve this seems too theoretical for practical implementation.

I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that the sequence a should cover all sums from 1 to n except k.

Hence, the set of subset sums should be exactly {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

Given that, perhaps I can find a sequence a such that the subset sums equal this set.

But how to construct such a sequence?

Let me consider that if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to s, and s >= n, then I can adjust it to exclude k.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can use the standard binary sequence of powers of 2, and adjust one element to block the sum k.

But I'm not sure how.

Let me consider that in the binary sequence [1,2,4,8,...], the sum k can be represented uniquely as a sum of some subset.

To prevent this sum, I can modify one of the elements involved in this sum.

For example, if k=3=1+2, I can replace 2 with another number that doesn't allow sum 3.

But then, I need to ensure that other sums can still be formed.

This seems too ad-hoc.

Let me consider that for k=1, it's easy: just include elements >=2.

For k=2, include elements that can't sum to 2, but can sum to 1 and other values.

But this varies for different k.

I need a general method.

Let me consider that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6.

Hence, the elements must be chosen carefully to cover the required sums efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that are powers of 2, but adjust the sequence based on k.

For example, if k is a power of 2, say k=4, then in the sequence [1,2,4,8,...], the sum k=4 is just the element 4 itself.

Hence, to prevent sum k=4, I can remove 4 from the sequence.

But then, sums that required 4 can't be formed.

To compensate, I can include other elements that allow forming those sums without using 4.

But it's not clear how.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements that are slightly different from the powers of 2.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that are powers of 2, but adjust one element to block the sum k.

For example, if k=3=1+2, I can replace 2 with 3, so the sequence becomes [1,3,4,8,...].

Then, sums that would have used 2 can now use 3 instead.

Let's see:

Sequence: [1,3,4]

- Sums:1,3,4,5(1+4),6(3+4),7(1+3+4)

- Missing:2

- If k=3, then excluding sum 3.

Wait, but in this sequence, sum 3 is present (just 3), so it doesn't work.

Hence, need to adjust further.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider that in order to exclude sum k, I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

This is similar to the concept of a minimal set that doesn't contain a specific sum, which is related to the concept of an additive basis in number theory.

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can output a sequence that works based on the properties of n and k.

Given that t=1000 and n up to 10^6, with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, I need an efficient solution.

Looking back at the sample outputs, it seems that for k=1, using elements >=2 works.

For k=8 and n=8, using multiple 1's works for sums up to 7.

For other cases, it's less clear.

Perhaps I can categorize the cases based on the value of k.

Case 1: k=1

- Sequence can consist of elements >=2, covering sums from 2 to n.

- For example, [2,3,4,...] up to n.

- But for large n, this would require too many elements, but m can be up to 25.

- Hence, need a smarter way.

Case 2: k=2

- Need to exclude sum 2, but cover sums from 1 and 3 to n.

- For example, sequence [1,3,4,...]

- But again, for large n, need to cover up to n.

Case 3: k > 2
