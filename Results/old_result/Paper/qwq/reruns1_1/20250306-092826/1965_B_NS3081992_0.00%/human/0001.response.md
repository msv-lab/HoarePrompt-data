Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints, which is good to know.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. The constraints say that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9. Also, the number of test cases is up to 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^7, which seems manageable.

Let me consider some small examples to get an intuition.

Example 1:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Looking at the first test case:

n=2, k=2

Sequence: [1]

- No subsequence sums to 2. The only subsequence is [1], which sums to 1.

- For v=1 (since v=2 is k), there is a subsequence that sums to 1.

Good.

Second test case:

n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

- No subsequence sums to 1, since all elements are at least 2.

- For v=2 to 6, there are subsequences that sum to each of these values.

For example:

- 2: [2]

- 3: [3]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [5]

- 6: [6]

Third test case:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- No subsequence sums to 8, since the maximum sum is 7.

- For v=1 to 7, there are subsequences that sum to each of these values.

Fourth test case:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

- No subsequence sums to 3.

Let's check:

Possible subsets and their sums:

- []: 0

- [7]: 7

- [1]: 1

- [4]: 4

- [1]: 1

- [7,1]: 8

- [7,4]: 11

- [7,1]: 8

- [1,4]: 5

- [1,1]: 2

- [7,1,4]: 12

- [7,1,1]: 9

- [1,4,1]: 6

- [7,1,4,1]: 13

None of these sum to 3.

But for other v from 1 to 9, except 3, there are subsequences that sum to those values.

For example:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [1,1]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [1,4]

- 6: [1,1,4]

- 7: [7]

- 8: [7,1]

- 9: [7,1,1]

Wait, but 3 is missing, which is good.

Fifth test case:

n=10, k=7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

- No subsequence sums to 7.

Possible subsets:

- []: 0

- [1]: 1

- [2]: 2

- [8]: 8

- [3]: 3

- [1,2]: 3

- [1,8]: 9

- [1,3]: 4

- [2,8]: 10

- [2,3]: 5

- [8,3]: 11

- [1,2,8]: 11

- [1,2,3]: 6

- [1,8,3]: 12

- [2,8,3]: 13

- [1,2,8,3]: 14

None sum to 7.

For other v from 1 to 10, except 7, there are subsequences that sum to those values.

So, the sequences provided in the examples seem to satisfy the conditions.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such a sequence for any given n and k.

Let me think about the properties such a sequence should have.

First, the sequence should be able to generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

This sounds related to the concept of subset sum problems.

One key idea in subset sum problems is that if you have a set of numbers where each number is a power of 2, then you can generate any sum up to the total sum of the set.

For example, [1,2,4,8] can generate any sum from 1 to 15.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one particular sum, k, while being able to generate all other sums up to n.

So, perhaps I can start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it in some way to exclude the sum k.

Alternatively, maybe I can choose a set where k cannot be formed as a sum, but all other sums up to n can be formed.

Let me consider the properties of k.

If k is 1, that means no subsequence should sum to 1, but all other sums from 2 to n should be possible.

Similarly, if k is n, no subsequence should sum to n, but all sums from 1 to n-1 should be possible.

In general, for any k between 1 and n, I need to ensure that k cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence, while all other sums from 1 to n (except k) can be formed.

I need to find a sequence of at most 25 non-negative integers that satisfies these conditions.

Also, the sequence elements can be up to 10^9, which is quite large, so I need to be careful with how I choose them.

Let me think about the maximum possible n, which is 10^6.

Given that, and that m is at most 25, I need an efficient way to construct such a sequence.

I need to think about the properties of the sequence that allow me to generate all sums except k.

One approach could be to include small numbers that allow me to generate a wide range of sums, but exclude the sum k.

For example, if I include 1, then I can generate sum 1, but that would violate the condition if k=1.

Wait, in the first example, when n=2 and k=2, the sequence is [1], which can only sum to 1, and since k=2, it's okay.

But in the second example, n=6 and k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which cannot sum to 1, and can sum to all other values from 2 to 6.

So, in that case, since k=1, I can just have all elements starting from 2 upwards.

Wait, but in general, k could be any value between 1 and n.

So, perhaps I can categorize based on the value of k.

Case 1: k=1

If k=1, then I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, but all other sums from 2 to n are possible.

In this case, I can choose all elements to be at least 2.

For example, [2,3,4,...], up to a point where the sum can reach n.

But I need to be careful with the number of elements, as m must be at most 25.

Case 2: k=n

If k=n, then I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to n, but all other sums from 1 to n-1 are possible.

In this case, I need to choose elements such that their total sum is at least n-1, but no combination sums to n.

This might require excluding certain elements or choosing elements in a way that their sum cannot reach n.

Case 3: 1 < k < n

In this case, I need to ensure that k cannot be formed as a sum, but all other sums from 1 to n (except k) can be formed.

This seems more tricky, as I need to carefully choose elements to avoid the sum k while allowing all other sums.

I need a general strategy that works for any k between 1 and n.

Let me think about the concept of subset sum and how to manipulate the sequence to exclude one particular sum.

One idea is to start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to some value, and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

For example, if I have a set that can generate all sums from 1 to s, where s >= n, and then I modify it so that the sum k is excluded.

But how can I modify it to exclude only k?

One possible way is to split the set into two parts: one that can generate sums without including k, and another that complements it.

But this seems vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to s, where s >= n.

Then, if I remove an element from A that is equal to k, the new set A' might not be able to generate k, but it might affect other sums as well.

This might not be sufficient, as other combinations might still sum to k.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed.

Wait, maybe I can include elements that are multiples of some number, or have some specific properties that make their sums avoid k.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the binary representation of numbers.

Since subset sums correspond to selecting or not selecting each element, it's similar to binary choices.

If I have elements that are powers of 2, like [1,2,4,8,...], then any sum can be represented uniquely.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one particular sum, which would require modifying this set.

For example, if I have [1,2,4,8], I can generate sums from 0 to 15.

If I want to exclude sum 3, I need to modify the set so that no combination sums to 3, but can still sum to other values.

But how?

One idea is to remove 1 and include 2 and 4, but then I can't sum to 1.

But in this problem, I need to be able to sum to all values except k.

So, removing 1 would exclude sum 1, which might be acceptable if k=1.

Wait, in the first example, when k=2, the sequence is [1], which can sum to 1 but not 2.

So, in that case, it's acceptable.

But in other cases, it's more complicated.

Let me consider the binary representation again.

Suppose I have a set where the elements are powers of 2, up to a certain point.

Then, any sum can be represented uniquely.

But I need to exclude one particular sum, k.

Perhaps I can remove the element that corresponds to the least significant bit in k and adjust accordingly.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the binary representation of k.

Let me try to think of a general approach.

I need a sequence a1, a2, ..., am, where m <= 25, such that:

- No subset of a sums to k.

- For every v from 1 to n, v != k, there exists a subset of a that sums to v.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and m is at most 25, I need to choose a sequence that can generate a large number of sums with a small number of elements.

This sounds like I need a sequence with a high degree of combinatory properties, but excluding one specific sum.

One possible strategy is to choose a sequence where the sums cover a wide range, but with a gap at k.

How can I ensure that k is not achievable, but all other sums are?

One idea is to have a sequence where the sums up to a certain point cover all values up to a limit, but then skip k and continue covering the rest.

This sounds similar to the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, where with two coin denominations a and b, the largest sum that cannot be formed is ab - a - b, assuming a and b are coprime.

But in this problem, I can have up to 25 elements, not just two.

This seems too simplistic for this problem.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to s, and another set B that can generate sums from 1 to t, but their combination is modified to exclude k.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except k.

- Ensure that no subset sums to k.

- Make sure that the set has at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, generating all sums up to 10^6 with 25 elements is feasible if the elements are chosen carefully.

For example, using powers of 2, up to 2^24, which is over 16 million, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6.

But again, I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

How can I modify the set of powers of 2 to exclude k?

One idea is to remove the element that corresponds to the binary representation of k.

But that might not be sufficient, as other combinations might still sum to k.

Wait, for example, if k=3, and I have [1,2,4], then 1+2=3.

If I remove 1, then I can't sum to 1 or 3, but I can sum to 2 and 4.

But in this problem, I need to be able to sum to all values except k.

So, removing 1 would prevent summing to 1 and 3, which might not be desirable unless k=1 or k=3.

This seems too specific.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude the sum k.

One way to exclude k is to remove an element that is necessary for forming k.

But again, k could be formed in multiple ways, so removing one element might not be enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed.

Wait, maybe I can include elements that are all greater than k, so no subset can sum to k.

But then, how do I generate sums less than k?

Unless k=1, which is a special case.

Wait, in the second example, n=6, k=1, and the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which cannot sum to 1, and can sum to all other values from 2 to 6.

In this case, since all elements are greater than k=1, no subset can sum to 1.

Similarly, for k=n, I can include elements that sum up to n-1, but not n.

But in general, for any k, I need a more general approach.

Let me consider dividing the problem into two parts:

1. Ensure that k cannot be formed as a sum.

2. Ensure that all other sums from 1 to n (except k) can be formed.

One possible way is to construct two separate subsets:

- One subset that can generate all sums up to some value, excluding k.

- Another subset that can generate the remaining sums.

But this seems unclear.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except k.

- Ensure that no combination of these elements sums to k.

This sounds similar to generating all subsets except those that sum to k.

But it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the fact that m is at most 25.

This means that the number of possible subsets is 2^m - 1 = 33,554,431, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6.

So, in terms of the number of subsets, it's manageable.

But I need to ensure that none of these subsets sum to k.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements required to generate all sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

If I can find such a minimal set, it would likely have fewer elements, but in this problem, m can be up to 25, which is more than enough.

Perhaps I can start by including small elements to generate smaller sums and larger elements to reach up to n.

But again, ensuring that k cannot be formed is challenging.

Let me consider the following strategy:

- Start with a base set that can generate all sums from 1 to n.

- Modify this set to exclude the sum k.

One way to modify the set is to remove an element that is necessary for forming k.

But as mentioned earlier, k might be formed in multiple ways, so removing one element might not be sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements in such a way that the sum k cannot be achieved due to missing certain combinations.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for an algorithmic approach.

I recall that the subset sum problem is NP-complete, but since n can be up to 10^6 and m is small (<=25), perhaps a dynamic programming approach can be used to verify if a given sequence satisfies the conditions.

But in this problem, I need to construct such a sequence efficiently for multiple test cases.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the following observation:

If I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to s, and another set B that can generate all sums from 1 to t, and A and B are disjoint, then their union can generate all sums from 1 to s + t.

But how does this help in excluding one specific sum k?

Not directly.

Wait, perhaps I can have one subset that generates sums up to some value, and another that generates higher sums, ensuring that k cannot be formed.

This still seems unclear.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix a sequence a1, a2, ..., am, and I need to ensure that the subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

One way to approach this is to ensure that the set of possible subset sums is exactly {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

This seems difficult to achieve directly.

An alternative approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle to select elements such that the possible sums cover the desired range except for k.

But this seems too abstract.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Choose a set of elements such that their subset sums cover all integers from 1 to n, except for k.

- Ensure that no subset sums to k.

Given that m is small (<=25), and n can be up to 10^6, I need to choose elements that allow for a large number of distinct sums.

One way to maximize the number of distinct sums is to choose elements that are powers of 2, as their subset sums can represent any integer uniquely up to the sum of all elements.

But in this case, I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

If I use powers of 2, and remove the element corresponding to the binary representation of k, would that work?

Probably not, because k could be formed by other combinations.

For example, if k=3 and I have [1,2,4], removing 1 would prevent summing to 1 and 3, but [2] sums to 2, [4] sums to 4, etc.

But in this problem, I need to be able to sum to all values except k.

So, removing 1 would prevent summing to 1 and 3, which might be acceptable if k=3, but not if k=2.

This seems too case-specific.

Let me think about a different strategy.

Suppose I start with a minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

For example, if I have a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I find a way to modify it so that k is no longer achievable.

But how?

One idea is to remove an element that is necessary for forming k.

But as mentioned earlier, k might be formable in multiple ways.

So, removing one element might not be sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I can replace an element with another value that prevents k from being formed.

This seems promising.

Let me explore this.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to s, where s >= n.

I identify that some subsets sum to k.

To prevent this, I can adjust one of the elements in such a way that those subsets no longer sum to k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider a specific example.

Take n=6, k=3.

I need a sequence where no subset sums to 3, but all other sums from 1 to 6, except 3, are possible.

From the example, one solution is [2,3,4,5,6].

Wait, but in this sequence, [2,1] sums to 3, but 1 is not in the sequence.

Wait, no, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which cannot sum to 1,2,3, but according to the problem, it should be able to sum to all v from 1 to 6 except k=3.

Wait, but in this sequence, I cannot sum to 1 or 2, which contradicts the requirement.

Wait, in this sequence, the smallest sum is 2, and the sums possible are 2,3,4,5,6, which seems to include 3, but according to the problem, it should not include 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier understanding.

Looking back at the example:

Second test case:

Input:

6 1

Output:

5

2 3 4 5 6

Wait, n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

- No subsequence sums to 1, which is k.

- Can sum to 2,3,4,5,6.

But according to the problem, for v from 1 to n (v=1 to 6), excluding k=1, need to have subsequences that sum to v.

But in this sequence, I can sum to 2,3,4,5,6, which matches v=2 to 6.

So, it's acceptable.

Wait, but in the earlier explanation, I thought that [2,3,4,5,6] can sum to 3, which is k=1, but k=1 is excluded.

Wait, no, k=1 is the value that should not be summable, which is correctly achieved by having all elements >=2.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Another example:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- No subsequence sums to 8, since the maximum sum is 7.

- Can sum to 1 through 7.

Good.

Another example:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

- No subsequence sums to 3.

- Can sum to other values from 1 to 9, except 3.

Wait, but in this sequence, [1,2] sums to 3, but 2 is not in the sequence.

Wait, the sequence is [7,1,4,1].

Possible sums:

- 1,4,5,6,7,8,9, but not 2,3.

But according to the problem, it should be able to sum to all v from 1 to 9 except k=3.

But in this sequence, it seems that 2 and 3 cannot be summed, which might be a mistake.

Wait, in the earlier explanation, I thought that [1,1,4,7] can sum to 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9, but not 3.

But according to the problem, it's acceptable to not sum to k=3.

Wait
