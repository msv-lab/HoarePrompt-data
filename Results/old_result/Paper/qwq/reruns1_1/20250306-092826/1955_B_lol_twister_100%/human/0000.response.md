Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this thing called a "progressive square," which is an n x n matrix. Maxim chooses three integers: a_{1,1}, c, and d, and constructs this square based on some rules. From the example, when n=3, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, and d=3, the square looks like this:

But wait, the example isn't showing up here. Okay, maybe I need to recall how these progressive squares are constructed. It says that for any values of n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there exists exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules. So, the construction must be unique for given a_{1,1}, c, and d.

Last month, Maxim constructed such a square and remembered n, c, and d. Now, he found an array of n^2 integers in random order and wants to check if these are the elements of that specific square.

My task is to determine, for each test case, whether the given array b contains exactly the elements of the progressive square defined by n, c, and d.

First, I need to understand how the progressive square is constructed from a_{1,1}, c, and d.

Looking back at the problem, it doesn't explicitly state the rules for constructing the square, except through an example. Hmm, maybe I need to infer the rules from the example.

Let me look at the example provided:

Input:

5

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8

2 100 100

400 300 400 500

3 2 3

3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8

4 4 4

15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15

Output:

NO

YES

YES

NO

NO

From the first test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

Array: 3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

Output: NO

Second test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

Array: 3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8

Output: YES

Third test case:

n=2, c=100, d=100

Array: 400 300 400 500

Output: YES

Fourth test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

Array: 3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8

Output: NO

Fifth test case:

n=4, c=4, d=4

Array: 15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15

Output: NO

I need to figure out the pattern in which the progressive square is constructed using a_{1,1}, c, and d.

Looking at the first test case, n=3, c=2, d=3, and a_{1,1}=1.

Let me try to construct the square:

Row 1:

a_{1,1} = 1

a_{1,2} = a_{1,1} + d = 1 + 3 = 4

a_{1,3} = a_{1,2} + d = 4 + 3 = 7

Row 2:

a_{2,1} = a_{1,1} + c = 1 + 2 = 3

a_{2,2} = a_{2,1} + d = 3 + 3 = 6

a_{2,3} = a_{2,2} + d = 6 + 3 = 9

Row 3:

a_{3,1} = a_{2,1} + c = 3 + 2 = 5

a_{3,2} = a_{3,1} + d = 5 + 3 = 8

a_{3,3} = a_{3,2} + d = 8 + 3 = 11

So, the progressive square should be:

1 4 7

3 6 9

5 8 11

Now, flattening this into an array: [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11]

Sorting this array: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

Now, look at the first test case's array: 3,9,6,5,7,1,10,4,8

Sorting this: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Comparing with the expected sorted array [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11], we see that 10 is present instead of 11. Hence, it should be "NO", which matches the output.

Second test case: array is 3,9,6,5,7,1,11,4,8

Sorting: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11], which matches the expected sorted array, so "YES".

Third test case: n=2, c=100, d=100

a_{1,1}=?

Let's find a_{1,1}.

From the construction:

Row 1: a_{1,1}, a_{1,1} + d

Row 2: a_{1,1} + c, a_{1,1} + c + d

Flattened: [a_{1,1}, a_{1,1} + d, a_{1,1} + c, a_{1,1} + c + d]

Sorting this array should match the given array: 400,300,400,500

So, sorted array: [300,400,400,500]

So, [a_{1,1}, a_{1,1} + d, a_{1,1} + c, a_{1,1} + c + d] sorted is [300,400,400,500]

Let's assume a_{1,1}=300

Then, a_{1,1} + d = 300 + d

a_{1,1} + c = 300 + c

a_{1,1} + c + d = 300 + c + d

Given that c=100, d=100

So, a_{1,1}=300

Then:

a_{1,1} + d = 300 + 100 = 400

a_{1,1} + c = 300 + 100 = 400

a_{1,1} + c + d = 300 + 100 + 100 = 500

So, the flattened array is [300,400,400,500], which matches the sorted given array. Hence, "YES".

Fourth test case: n=3, c=2, d=3

Array: 3,9,6,6,5,1,11,4,8

Sorting: [1,3,4,5,6,6,8,9,11]

Expected: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

Here, there are two 6's instead of one 6 and one 7. Hence, "NO".

Fifth test case: n=4, c=4, d=4

Array: 15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15

Sorting: [3,7,7,11,11,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27]

Now, construct the progressive square:

a_{1,1}=?

Row 1: a_{1,1}, a_{1,1}+d, a_{1,1}+2d, a_{1,1}+3d

Row 2: a_{1,1}+c, a_{1,1}+c+d, a_{1,1}+c+2d, a_{1,1}+c+3d

Row 3: a_{1,1}+2c, a_{1,1}+2c+d, a_{1,1}+2c+2d, a_{1,1}+2c+3d

Row 4: a_{1,1}+3c, a_{1,1}+3c+d, a_{1,1}+3c+2d, a_{1,1}+3c+3d

Given c=4 and d=4, let's find a_{1,1}.

We can set up equations based on the sorted array.

But this seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.

Looking back, perhaps I can generalize the construction of the progressive square.

In general, for an n x n matrix, the element at position (i,j) is a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d

So, the entire matrix can be represented as:

a_{1,1}    a_{1,1} + d   a_{1,1} + 2d  ...  a_{1,1} + (n-1)d

a_{1,1} + c  a_{1,1} + c + d  ...  a_{1,1} + c + (n-1)d

...

a_{1,1} + (n-1)c  ...  a_{1,1} + (n-1)(c + d)

Flattening this into an array, we have n^2 elements:

[a_{1,1}, a_{1,1} + d, a_{1,1} + 2d, ..., a_{1,1} + (n-1)d,

 a_{1,1} + c, a_{1,1} + c + d, ..., a_{1,1} + c + (n-1)d,

 ...

 a_{1,1} + (n-1)c, ..., a_{1,1} + (n-1)c + (n-1)d]

Now, to check if a given array b of n^2 integers can be rearranged to match this flattened array, I can generate the expected sorted array based on a_{1,1}, c, and d, and sort it, then compare it with the sorted version of b.

But I don't know a_{1,1}. How can I find it?

From the problem, it says that Maxim chooses a_{1,1}, c, and d, but in the problem, a_{1,1} is not provided; only n, c, and d are provided, along with the array b.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says: "Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific square."

So, I have n, c, d, and b, and I need to check if b contains exactly the elements of the progressive square defined by a_{1,1}, c, d, for some a_{1,1}.

Wait, but it says "the specific square," implying that a_{1,1} is fixed, but it's not provided. Maybe I misread.

Looking back: "the specific square that satisfies all the rules."

Wait, the problem says: "It can be shown that for any values of n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there exists exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules."

But in the problem statement, a_{1,1} is not given; only n, c, d, and b are given.

Wait, perhaps I need to infer a_{1,1} from the array b.

Looking back, the first test case has n=3, c=2, d=3, and array [3,9,6,5,7,1,10,4,8]. From my earlier construction, assuming a_{1,1}=1, the square is:

1,4,7

3,6,9

5,8,11

But in the array, there is a 10 instead of 11, hence "NO".

In the second test case, array is [3,9,6,5,7,1,11,4,8], which matches the expected [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11], so "YES".

So, perhaps I can generate the expected sorted array based on a_{1,1}=min(b), and then check if the sorted b matches the sorted expected array.

Wait, in the first test case, min(b)=1, and expected array is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11], but b sorted is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], which doesn't match, hence "NO".

In the second test case, b sorted is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11], which matches the expected, hence "YES".

So, perhaps the approach is:

1. Find a_{1,1} as the minimum value in b.

2. Generate the expected array based on a_{1,1}, c, d:

For each i from 0 to n-1:

For each j from 0 to n-1:

expected_array[i*n + j] = a_{1,1} + i*c + j*d

3. Sort the expected array and sort b, then compare them.

This seems to be the approach in the given program.

Looking at the given program:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):

a = min(l)

li = []

for k in range(0, n):

for h in range(0, n):

li.append(a + k * c + d * h)

li.sort()

l.sort()

if l == li:

return 'yes'

return 'no'

Yes, this is exactly the approach I just described.

So, is this correct?

Looking back at the examples:

First test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

b = [3,9,6,5,7,1,10,4,8]

a_{1,1} = min(b) = 1

expected_array = [1 + 0*2 + 0*3, 1 + 0*2 + 1*3, 1 + 0*2 + 2*3,

1 + 1*2 + 0*3, 1 + 1*2 + 1*3, 1 + 1*2 + 2*3,

1 + 2*2 + 0*3, 1 + 2*2 + 1*3, 1 + 2*2 + 2*3]

= [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11]

sorted expected: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

sorted b: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

They don't match, so "NO"

Second test case:

b = [3,9,6,5,7,1,11,4,8]

sorted b: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

which matches the expected, so "YES"

Third test case:

n=2, c=100, d=100

b = [400,300,400,500]

a_{1,1} = min(b) = 300

expected_array = [300 + 0*100 + 0*100, 300 + 0*100 + 1*100,

300 + 1*100 + 0*100, 300 + 1*100 + 1*100]

= [300,400,400,500]

sorted expected: [300,400,400,500]

sorted b: [300,400,400,500]

matches, so "YES"

Fourth test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

b = [3,9,6,6,5,1,11,4,8]

sorted b: [1,3,4,5,6,6,8,9,11]

expected: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

don't match, so "NO"

Fifth test case:

n=4, c=4, d=4

b = [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

a_{1,1} = min(b) = 3

expected_array = [3 + 0*4 + 0*4, 3 + 0*4 + 1*4, 3 + 0*4 + 2*4, 3 + 0*4 + 3*4,

3 + 1*4 + 0*4, 3 + 1*4 + 1*4, 3 + 1*4 + 2*4, 3 + 1*4 + 3*4,

3 + 2*4 + 0*4, 3 + 2*4 + 1*4, 3 + 2*4 + 2*4, 3 + 2*4 + 3*4,

3 + 3*4 + 0*4, 3 + 3*4 + 1*4, 3 + 3*4 + 2*4, 3 + 3*4 + 3*4]

= [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27]

sorted expected: [3,7,7,11,11,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27]

sorted b: [3,7,7,11,11,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27]

matches, so should be "YES", but the output is "NO". Wait, is there a mistake?

Wait, in the problem's example output, it's "NO". But according to this, it should be "YES". Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, in the expected array, for n=4, c=4, d=4, a_{1,1}=3:

Row 1: 3, 7, 11, 15

Row 2: 7, 11, 15, 19

Row 3: 11, 15, 19, 23

Row 4: 15, 19, 23, 27

Flattened: [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27]

Sorted: [3,7,7,11,11,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27]

Given b: [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

Sorted b: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27]

Wait, the expected sorted array has [3,7,7,11,11,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27], but the sorted b has [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27]. So, the counts don't match: expected has two 11's, three 15's, three 19's, and three 23's, but b has three 11's, four 15's, two 19's, and three 23's. Hence, they don't match, so "NO", which matches the output.

So, the approach seems correct.

But is there any edge case where this approach might fail?

Let me think about it.

Suppose n=2, c=1, d=0

Then, the progressive square would be:

a, a+0, a+1, a+1

So, [a, a, a+1, a+1]

Sorted: [a, a, a+1, a+1]

Now, if b = [a, a, a+1, a+1], it should be "YES"

But if b = [a, a+1, a+1, a+2], it should be "NO", because a+2 is not in the expected array.

But according to the approach, a_{1,1} = min(b) = a

Expected array: [a, a, a+1, a+1]

Sorted b: [a, a+1, a+1, a+2]

Which don't match, so "NO"

Seems correct.

Another edge case: n=2, c=0, d=0

Progressive square: [a, a, a, a]

b = [a, a, a, a] => "YES"

b = [a, a, a, a+1] => "NO"

Seems correct.

Another case: n=1, but n starts from 2, as per constraints.

Another case: n=2, c=1, d=1

Expected array: [a, a+1, a+1, a+2]

Sorted: [a, a+1, a+1, a+2]

b = [a, a+1, a+1, a+2] => "YES"

b = [a, a, a+1, a+2] => "NO"

Seems correct.

Wait, but in the problem constraints, n starts from 2.

I think this approach is correct.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
