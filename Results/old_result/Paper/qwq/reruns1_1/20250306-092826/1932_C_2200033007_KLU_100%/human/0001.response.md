Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, a positive integer m, and a string of commands consisting of 'L's and 'R's. For each command, I need to output the product of the current array modulo m, and then remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R', respectively. This process repeats for all commands in the string.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have to process n commands for each test case, where n is the length of the array and the command string. After each command, the array decreases by one element, and I have to output the product modulo m at each step.

Looking at the example, it seems straightforward. For instance, in the first test case:

n = 4, m = 6

a = [3, 1, 4, 2]

s = "LRRL"

The outputs are: 0, 2, 4, 1

Let's walk through this example to understand what's happening.

1. Initial array: [3, 1, 4, 2]

- Product: 3 * 1 * 4 * 2 = 24

- 24 mod 6 = 0

- Command is 'L', so remove the first element (3)

- New array: [1, 4, 2]

2. Current array: [1, 4, 2]

- Product: 1 * 4 * 2 = 8

- 8 mod 6 = 2

- Command is 'R', so remove the last element (2)

- New array: [1, 4]

3. Current array: [1, 4]

- Product: 1 * 4 = 4

- 4 mod 6 = 4

- Command is 'R', so remove the last element (4)

- New array: [1]

4. Current array: [1]

- Product: 1

- 1 mod 6 = 1

- Command is 'L', so remove the first element (1)

- New array: empty

So, the outputs are correct as per the example.

Now, I need to think about how to implement this efficiently, especially considering that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, but the total sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5. So, I need an efficient solution that doesn't exceed time limits.

Let's think about the naive approach first. For each test case, I can iterate through the commands, calculate the product modulo m at each step, and remove the appropriate element from the array. However, calculating the product from scratch at each step would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way to compute the product modulo m efficiently after each removal.

One idea is to precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m. Since we're dealing with products and modulo operations, I need to be careful with zeros and with the modulo operation's properties.

Let me think about how prefix and suffix products can help.

Suppose I have the array [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]

I can compute the prefix product up to each index i: prefix[i] = a1 * a2 * ... * ai mod m

And the suffix product from each index i: suffix[i] = ai * a(i+1) * ... * an mod m

Then, for each step, depending on whether I remove from the left or the right, I can use these prefix and suffix products to compute the current product modulo m.

Wait, but in this problem, the array is being modified by removing elements from either end, so the remaining array is a subarray that could be from any part of the original array.

Actually, as I remove elements from either end, the remaining array is a subarray that is contiguous.

Wait, no. As I remove from either end, the remaining array remains contiguous, but the specific subarray changes based on the sequence of 'L's and 'R's.

Hmm, so perhaps prefix and suffix products aren't directly applicable here.

Let me think differently.

Another approach is to simulate the process efficiently.

I need to keep track of the product of the current array modulo m.

At each step:

- Output the current product modulo m

- Remove an element from either the left or the right

The challenge is to update the product efficiently when removing an element.

But in multiplication, removing an element would require dividing by that element, but in modular arithmetic, division isn't straightforward.

Wait, in modular arithmetic, if m is coprime with the element being removed, I can multiply by the modular inverse of that element.

But m could be any positive integer up to 10^4, and the elements a_i are up to 10^4, so m and a_i may or may not be coprime.

This complicates things.

Let me think about how to handle the product modulo m efficiently.

One idea is to keep track of the product of the current array modulo m, and maintain a data structure that allows me to remove elements from either end efficiently.

In Python, lists have O(1) time complexity for appending and popping from both ends, so I can use a list to represent the array.

But directly removing elements one by one and recalculating the product each time would be too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the sequence of removals.

Since the commands are given in a string, I can know in advance the entire sequence of removals.

So, perhaps I can simulate the process by keeping track of which elements are removed in what order.

Wait, actually, since I'm removing elements one by one from either end, I can think of this as repeatedly removing the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command.

So, maybe I can use two pointers to keep track of the current left and right boundaries of the array.

Wait, but as I remove elements from either end, the remaining array changes, and I need to compute the product of the current array modulo m each time.

Is there a way to compute the product of the current subarray efficiently?

Let me consider precomputing the product of the entire array, then updating it as I remove elements.

But again, updating the product by removing an element requires division, which is tricky in modular arithmetic.

Unless m is a prime or has some properties that allow easy computation of inverses.

But m can be any positive integer up to 10^4, so I can't assume that.

Wait, perhaps I can factor m into its prime factors and compute the product modulo each prime power, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine the results.

But this seems too complicated and may not necessarily speed things up.

Let me consider another approach.

What if I precompute the product of all elements, and then for each removal, divide by the removed element modulo m, if possible.

But again, division in modular arithmetic requires that the element and m are coprime, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, I can keep track of the product and update it by division only when the element and m are coprime, and handle the cases where they are not separately.

This seems too involved.

Let me think differently.

Another idea is to compute the product of the current array as the product of all elements divided by the product of the removed elements, and then take modulo m.

But this again runs into the problem of division in modular arithmetic.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product of the removed elements and multiply by their modular inverses, if they exist.

But again, this requires that the removed elements are coprime with m, which may not be the case.

This seems problematic.

Let me consider a different strategy.

What if I maintain a list of the current array and recalculate the product modulo m at each step?

But this is O(n^2) time, which is too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need something faster.

Let me consider the sequence of removals and see if I can determine the order in which elements are removed, and thus determine which elements are still in the array at each step.

Wait, actually, since I have the entire sequence of commands in advance, I can simulate the process and keep track of which elements are removed in what order.

Then, for each step, I can compute the product of the remaining elements modulo m.

But this still seems too slow if done naively.

Wait, perhaps I can process the commands in reverse.

That is, start from the end, where the array is empty, and add elements back according to the commands in reverse order.

Wait, maybe that can work.

Let me think about this.

If I reverse the sequence of commands, I can simulate adding elements to either end of the array, and keep track of the product modulo m.

Wait, but in the original problem, we are removing elements from either end, not adding them.

But perhaps by reversing the process, I can build the array step by step and compute the product modulo m incrementally.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have the final empty array, with product 1 (since the product of an empty set is conventionally 1, but in this case, it would be the neutral element for multiplication).

Then, I can reverse the sequence of commands and add elements back to either end.

At each step, I add an element to one end, and update the product accordingly.

Then, the product at each step in the original process would correspond to the product after adding the corresponding element in this reverse process.

Wait, this might be a way to compute the products efficiently.

Let me try to see with the first example.

n = 4, m = 6

a = [3, 1, 4, 2]

s = "LRRL"

Let's reverse the commands: "LRRL"

Now, starting with an empty array, and product = 1.

1. Add 'L': add 3 to the left, array becomes [3], product = 3

2. Add 'R': add 2 to the right, array becomes [3, 2], product = 3 * 2 = 6

3. Add 'R': add 4 to the right, array becomes [3, 2, 4], product = 6 * 4 = 24

4. Add 'L': add 1 to the left, array becomes [1, 3, 2, 4], product = 24 * 1 = 24

Now, if I reverse these products, I get the original outputs: 24 mod 6 = 0, then 6 mod 6 = 0, then 3 mod 6 = 3, then 1 mod 6 = 1

Wait, but in the example, the outputs are 0, 2, 4, 1.

Hmm, something's not matching here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reverse process.

Let me try again.

Original sequence: "LRRL"

Reversed sequence: "LRRL"

Starting with an empty array and product = 1.

1. Command 'L': add 3 to the left, array = [3], product = 3

2. Command 'R': add 2 to the right, array = [3, 2], product = 3 * 2 = 6

3. Command 'R': add 4 to the right, array = [3, 2, 4], product = 6 * 4 = 24

4. Command 'L': add 1 to the left, array = [1, 3, 2, 4], product = 24 * 1 = 24

Now, reversing the products: 24, 24, 6, 3

Then, taking modulo 6: 0, 0, 0, 3

But in the example, it's 0, 2, 4, 1.

So, this approach isn't giving the correct results.

I must have misunderstood something.

Let me think again.

Maybe I need to track which elements are being removed in which order and compute the product of the remaining elements accordingly.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to simulate the process using two pointers, one for the left and one for the right, and keep track of the product as I remove elements from either end.

But again, updating the product efficiently is tricky due to the modulo operation.

Another idea is to precompute the product of all elements, and keep track of the product of removed elements, and then divide the total product by the product of removed elements.

But again, division in modular arithmetic is only straightforward when the divisor and m are coprime.

Given that m can be up to 10^4 and a_i up to 10^4, it's possible that a_i and m share common factors, making division non-trivial.

I need another approach.

Let me consider that for each step, I need to compute the product of the current array modulo m.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the total n across all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements, and then for each step, divide by the removed element using modular inverse if possible.

But as mentioned earlier, this only works if the removed element and m are coprime.

Wait, maybe I can factor m into its prime factors and handle each prime power separately, then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems too complicated and may not be efficient enough.

Let me think about the constraints.

m is up to 10^4, which is manageable.

n is up to 2*10^5 per test case, but with t up to 10^4 and total n up to 2*10^5, it should be fine.

I need an efficient way to compute the product modulo m at each step, considering the removals from either end.

Another idea is to use a deque (double-ended queue) to simulate the removals from either end.

In Python, deque supports O(1) time complexity for append and pop from both ends.

But even with a deque, I still need to compute the product modulo m efficiently at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain the product of the current deque, and update it as I remove elements.

But again, removing an element requires dividing by that element, which is problematic in modular arithmetic.

This seems like a dead end.

Let me consider that m is small, up to 10^4, which might allow for precomputing some values related to m.

For example, precomputing the modular inverses for all numbers up to m, but only when they are coprime with m.

But again, this doesn't solve the general case when a_i and m are not coprime.

I need to find a way to compute the product of the current array modulo m efficiently, without having to perform division.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the exponents of the prime factors in m.

Suppose I factor m into its prime factors, say m = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pt^kt.

Then, I can keep track of the exponents of p1, p2, ..., pt in the product of the current array.

Then, the product modulo m can be computed using the exponents of these primes.

This is similar to computing the product modulo m by handling each prime power separately and then combining them using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

But this seems too involved and may not be efficient enough for the time constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me look at the provided program and see if it implements a correct solution.

The program is:

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

s = input()

print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):

b = []

l = 0

r = n - 1

for i in range(n):

if s[i] == 'L':

b.append(a[l])

l += 1

else:

b.append(a[r])

r -= 1

ans = []

p = 1

for v in reversed(b):

p = p * v % m

ans.append(p)

return reversed(ans)

So, the main function reads the inputs and calls func_1 for each test case, then prints the results.

Now, let's analyze func_1.

It initializes an empty list b, and sets l = 0 and r = n - 1, which are the left and right indices of the array a.

Then, it iterates through the commands in s, and for each command:

- If the command is 'L', it appends a[l] to b and increments l

- If the command is 'R', it appends a[r] to b and decrements r

So, b is a list of elements that are removed in the order specified by s.

Then, it initializes an empty list ans and p = 1.

It iterates through b in reverse order:

- For each v in reversed(b), it sets p = (p * v) % m and appends p to ans

- Finally, it returns reversed(ans)

Wait, that's interesting.

Let's see what this is doing.

Essentially, b is the list of elements removed in the order specified by s.

Then, by reversing b, we have the elements being removed in reverse order, which is like building the array back up.

So, starting from an empty array, we add back the last removed element, then the second last, and so on, until we have the original array.

In this process, p starts from 1 and is multiplied by each element in reversed(b), which is equivalent to building the product of the array step by step.

Then, by reversing ans, we get the product of the array at each step of the original removal process.

Wait, let's see with the first example:

n = 4, m = 6

a = [3, 1, 4, 2]

s = "LRRL"

So, processing s:

- i=0, s[0]='L', append a[0]=3, l=1

- i=1, s[1]='R', append a[3]=2, r=2

- i=2, s[2]='R', append a[2]=4, r=1

- i=3, s[3]='L', append a[1]=1, l=2

So, b = [3, 2, 4, 1]

Then, reversed(b) = [1, 4, 2, 3]

Initialize p=1

- First v=1, p = (1 * 1) % 6 = 1, ans=[1]

- Then v=4, p = (1 * 4) % 6 = 4, ans=[1,4]

- Then v=2, p = (4 * 2) % 6 = 8 % 6 = 2, ans=[1,4,2]

- Then v=3, p = (2 * 3) % 6 = 6 % 6 = 0, ans=[1,4,2,0]

Then, return reversed(ans) = [0,2,4,1]

Which matches the expected output: 0, 2, 4, 1

So, this approach seems to work.

Let's see why this works.

Essentially, by building up the product in reverse order, starting from the last removed element, we are effectively computing the product of the array at each step before the removal.

That is, the last product corresponds to the product of the entire array, and as we add elements in reverse order, we are simulating the product of smaller and smaller arrays, which correspond to the products before each removal in the original process.

This is a clever way to compute the required products without having to deal with division in modular arithmetic.

So, in this approach, we avoid the problem of division by building the product incrementally in reverse order.

This seems to be an efficient and correct solution.

Let's check another example to confirm.

Second test case:

n = 5, m = 1

a = [1,1,1,1,1]

s = "LLLLL"

Compute b:

- i=0, s[0]='L', append a[0]=1, l=1

- i=1, s[1]='L', append a[1]=1, l=2

- i=2, s[2]='L', append a[2]=1, l=3

- i=3, s[3]='L', append a[3]=1, l=4

- i=4, s[4]='L', append a[4]=1, l=5

So, b = [1,1,1,1,1]

reversed(b) = [1,1,1,1,1]

p=1

- v=1, p=1*1%1=0, ans=[0]

- v=1, p=0*1%1=0, ans=[0,0]

- v=1, p=0*1%1=0, ans=[0,0,0]

- v=1, p=0*1%1=0, ans=[0,0,0,0]

- v=1, p=0*1%1=0, ans=[0,0,0,0,0]

reversed(ans) = [0,0,0,0,0]

Which matches the expected output.

Another test case:

n=6, m=8

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

s="RLLLRR"

Compute b:

- i=0, s[0]='R', append a[5]=6, r=4

- i=1, s[1]='L', append a[0]=1, l=1

- i=2, s[2]='L', append a[1]=2, l=2

- i=3, s[3]='L', append a[2]=3, l=3

- i=4, s[4]='R', append a[4]=5, r=3

- i=5, s[5]='R', append a[3]=4, r=2

So, b=[6,1,2,3,5,4]

reversed(b)=[4,5,3,2,1,6]

p=1

- v=4, p=1*4%8=4, ans=[4]

- v=5, p=4*5%8=20%8=4, ans=[4,4]

- v=3, p=4*3%8=12%8=4, ans=[4,4,4]

- v=2, p=4*2%8=8%8=0, ans=[4,4,4,0]

- v=1, p=0*1%8=0, ans=[4,4,4,0,0]

- v=6, p=0*6%8=0, ans=[4,4,4,0,0,0]

reversed(ans)=[0,0,0,4,4,4]

Which matches the expected output.

Lastly, n=1, m=10000

a=[10000]

s="R"

Compute b:

- i=0, s[0]='R', append a[0]=10000, r=0

So, b=[10000]

reversed(b)=[10000]

p=1

- v=10000, p=1*10000%10000=0, ans=[0]

reversed(ans)=[0]

Which matches the expected output.

So, this approach seems to work correctly for all the examples.

It's efficient because it processes each test case in O(n) time, which is acceptable given the constraints.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
