Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. That means it's a complete graph with n nodes, right? Each pair of islands has a direct connection.

Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. But Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach. So, Dominater wants to make it so that Everule can access as few islands as possible.

My task is to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can still visit, given that Dominater acts optimally to destroy k bridges.

First, I need to understand the initial setup. With n islands and all possible bridges, Everule can reach any island from island 1 through some path, because the graph is connected.

Now, Dominater can destroy up to k bridges to disconnect some islands from island 1. I need to figure out how many islands can still be reached by Everule after these bridges are destroyed.

I need to think about how Dominater can maximize the number of islands disconnected from island 1 by destroying k bridges.

One way to approach this is to consider the bridges connected to island 1. If Dominater destroys bridges connected to island 1, he can isolate island 1 from other islands.

Wait, but Everule lives on island 1, so if Dominater destroys all bridges connected to island 1, Everule can't reach any other island, and only island 1 is accessible.

But the problem allows Dominater to destroy up to k bridges. So, if k is less than the number of bridges connected to island 1, Dominater might choose to destroy bridges in a way that maximizes the isolation of island 1.

Let me think differently. In a complete graph, every island is connected to every other island directly or through a series of bridges.

If Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, he should try to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1.

One strategy for Dominater is to destroy bridges in such a way that he separates as many islands as possible from island 1.

But destroying bridges connected to island 1 directly would be the most effective way to isolate island 1.

In a complete graph with n islands, island 1 is connected directly to n-1 other islands.

So, if Dominater destroys all these n-1 bridges, Everule can't reach any other island, and only island 1 is accessible.

But Dominater can only destroy up to k bridges. So, if k >= n-1, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, and Everule can only stay on island 1.

On the other hand, if k < n-1, Dominater can only destroy k bridges connected to island 1, meaning Everule can still reach at least (n-1 - k) islands directly, plus island 1 itself.

But wait, in a complete graph, even if some direct bridges are destroyed, there might still be paths through other islands.

For example, suppose n=4 and k=1. Islands are 1,2,3,4. Initially, there are bridges between all pairs.

If Dominater destroys the bridge between 1 and 2, Everule can still reach island 2 via island 1 to 3 to 2, since the bridge between 3 and 2 is still there.

So, in this case, even after destroying one bridge, Everule can still reach all islands.

Hmm, so destroying a single bridge might not necessarily disconnect any island from island 1, because there are alternative paths.

Therefore, Dominater needs to destroy bridges in such a way that he maximally disconnects islands from island 1, considering the connectivity provided by other bridges.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I need to think in terms of cutting off connections to island 1.

Let me consider the number of bridges connected to island 1, which is n-1.

If Dominater destroys all of them, he can isolate island 1 completely.

But if he can't destroy all of them (because k < n-1), then Everule can still reach some islands directly or through other paths.

Wait, but in a complete graph, as long as there is at least one bridge connected to island 1, Everule can reach all islands, because the graph remains connected.

Is that true? Let's see.

In a complete graph, even if you remove some bridges, as long as the graph remains connected, Everule can reach all islands.

So, the only way to limit the number of islands Everule can reach is to disconnect parts of the graph from island 1.

But in a complete graph, it's impossible to disconnect parts because there are multiple paths between any two islands.

Wait a minute, in a complete graph, it's impossible to disconnect any island from island 1 unless you remove all bridges connected to island 1.

Because even if you remove some bridges connected to island 1, there are still other paths through other islands.

Wait, no. Actually, in a complete graph, if you don't remove all bridges connected to island 1, there will always be a path from island 1 to any other island, possibly through multiple bridges.

So, unless Dominater removes all n-1 bridges connected to island 1, Everule can always reach all islands.

Therefore, if k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 by destroying all n-1 bridges connected to it, and Everule can only stay on island 1.

If k < n-1, no matter which k bridges Dominater destroys, there will still be at least one bridge connected to island 1, and thus Everule can reach all islands through those connections.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check the sample input and output.

In the sample input:

6

2 0

2 1

4 1

5 10

5 3

4 4

Corresponding output:

2

1

4

1

5

1

Let's analyze these:

First test case: n=2, k=0

- No bridges are destroyed.

- Everule can reach both islands: 1 and 2.

- Output: 2

Second test case: n=2, k=1

- One bridge is destroyed.

- Only island 1 is reachable.

- Output: 1

Third test case: n=4, k=1

- One bridge is destroyed.

- Even with one bridge destroyed, since k < n-1 = 3, Everule can still reach all islands through other paths.

- Output: 4

Fourth test case: n=5, k=10

- Number of bridges in a complete graph with 5 islands: 10.

- Dominater can destroy all 10 bridges.

- Everule can only stay on island 1.

- Output: 1

Fifth test case: n=5, k=3

- Dominater destroys 3 bridges.

- Since k < n-1 = 4, Everule can still reach all islands.

- Output: 5

Sixth test case: n=4, k=4

- Number of bridges in a complete graph with 4 islands: 6.

- Dominater destroys 4 bridges.

- But 4 < n-1 = 3? Wait, no, n-1 = 3.

- Wait, n=4, n-1=3.

- So k=4 > n-1=3.

- But according to earlier logic, if k >= n-1, Everule can only stay on island 1.

- But in this case, k=4 >= n-1=3, so output should be 1.

- Wait, but n=4, k=4: output is 1.

Wait, but in the sample input, n=4, k=1: output is 4.

n=4, k=4: output is 1.

This seems consistent with the earlier reasoning.

So, the general rule is:

- If k >= n-1, Everule can only stay on island 1.

- If k < n-1, Everule can reach all islands.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, n=5, k=3: k < n-1=4, so output is 5.

Yes, that matches.

So, the minimal number of islands Everule can reach is:

- 1, if k >= n-1

- n, if k < n-1

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10: k = 10 >= 5-1=4, so output is 1.

Third test case, n=4, k=1: k < 4-1=3, so output is 4.

Fifth test case, n=5, k=3: k < 5-1=4, so output is 5.

Sixth test case, n=4, k=4: k >= 4-1=3, so output is 1.

Yes, this seems to hold.

So, the minimal number of islands Everule can reach is:

- 1, if k >= n-1

- n, if k < n-1

This seems to be the pattern.

Therefore, the solution is straightforward:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case, read n and k.

- If k >= n-1, print 1

- Else, print n

Wait, but in the first test case, n=2, k=0: k < 2-1=1, so print 2

Second test case, n=2, k=1: k >= 2-1=1, so print 1

Third test case, n=4, k=1: k < 4-1=3, so print 4

Fourth test case, n=5, k=10: k >= 5-1=4, so print 1

Fifth test case, n=5, k=3: k < 5-1=4, so print 5

Sixth test case, n=4, k=4: k >= 4-1=3, so print 1

All match the sample outputs.

So, this seems correct.

Therefore, the program should implement this logic.

Looking at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)

Wait, this seems almost correct, but there might be a mistake.

Let's analyze this line:

print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)

So, n - k <= 1

If n - k <= 1, print n

Else, print 1

Wait, in the earlier reasoning, we have:

- If k >= n-1, print 1

- Else, print n

So, k >= n-1 is equivalent to k >= n-1

Which is equivalent to k - (n-1) >= 0

Or k - n +1 >=0

Or -n +k +1 >=0

Or n - k <=1

Yes, so n - k <=1 is equivalent to k >= n-1

Therefore, the condition in the program is correct.

So, print(n if n - k <=1 else 1) matches the required logic.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
