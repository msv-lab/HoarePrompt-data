Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, x and y, of the same length, and they're made up of digits from 1 to 9. I can swap the i-th digit of x with the i-th digit of y any number of times, and I need to maximize the product of x and y after these swaps.

First, I need to understand what swapping digits means in this context. For example, if x is 73 and y is 31, swapping the second digits would make x 71 and y 33. So, I can see that the product of x and y changes based on these swaps.

My goal is to maximize the product of x and y by performing these swaps optimally. I need to figure out the best way to swap digits to achieve the highest possible product.

Let me think about how the product of two numbers is affected by their digits. The product is maximized when both numbers are as large as possible. So, I should aim to make both x and y as large as possible individually.

Wait, but that might not always be the case. Because the product is the multiplication of x and y, it might be better to balance the digits between x and y rather than maximizing each individually.

Let me consider an example. Take x = 73 and y = 31. If I don't swap anything, x is 73 and y is 31, product is 73 * 31 = 2263.

If I swap the first digits: x becomes 33 and y becomes 71, product is 33 * 71 = 2343.

If I swap the second digits: x becomes 71 and y becomes 33, product is 71 * 33 = 2343.

So, in this case, swapping the digits leads to a higher product.

Another example: x = 2 and y = 5. If I don't swap, product is 2 * 5 = 10.

If I swap the only digit, x becomes 5 and y becomes 2, product is 5 * 2 = 10.

So, no change here.

Another example: x = 3516 and y = 3982.

If I don't swap anything, product is 3516 * 3982 = 14007912.

If I swap all digits pairwise: x becomes 3912 and y becomes 3586, product is 3912 * 3586 = 14043912.

That's higher than without swapping.

Wait, but according to the sample output, for x=3516 and y=3982, it's suggesting x=3912 and y=3586.

So, in this case, swapping certain digits increases the product.

I need to find a general strategy to maximize the product.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One idea is to sort the digits of x and y in a certain way to maximize the product.

I recall that for two numbers, to maximize their product, their digits should be as large as possible in the higher places, but considering both numbers together.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of greedy algorithms, where at each position, I decide whether to swap or not to maximize the product.

But that might be too simplistic.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the sum of the logarithms of x and y, since log(x*y) = log(x) + log(y), and try to maximize this sum.

But that seems more complicated.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

In the first sample:

Input:

73

31

Output:

71

33

So, swapping the second digits.

Product is 71 * 33 = 2343, which is higher than 73 * 31 = 2263.

In the second sample:

Input:

2

5

Output:

5

2

So, swapping the only digit, product remains the same.

In the third sample:

Input:

3516

3982

Output:

3912

3586

So, swapping certain digits to get higher product.

I need to find a general rule.

Let me consider the digits positions one by one, starting from the most significant digit.

At each position, I want to choose digits for x and y such that the overall product is maximized.

Maybe I can iterate through the digits and decide whether to swap or not based on some condition.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the digits in x and y together and assign them to x and y in a specific order.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two arrays, one for x and one for y, each containing their digits.

I can think of having two lists: a and b.

I need to decide for each position whether to swap or not.

But considering that swapping affects multiple positions, it's not straightforward.

An alternative approach: since the numbers have the same length, I can consider the digits pairwise for each position.

For each position, I have two digits: one from x and one from y.

I can decide whether to swap them or not.

I need to make decisions for each position independently, assuming that the decisions for other positions don't interfere.

Wait, but actually, the decisions might interfere because the overall product depends on all digits.

But for simplicity, maybe I can make local decisions.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for higher positions (more significant digits), I should prioritize making those as large as possible for both x and y.

But I need to balance this because making one number very large and the other small might not maximize the product.

Wait, no. Since the product is x * y, to maximize it, I need both x and y to be as large as possible.

So, I should aim to make both x and y as large as possible in their significant digits.

But how?

Let me consider that for each position, I have two digits: a[i] and b[i].

I need to decide whether to swap them or not.

If I swap, x becomes with b[i] in that position, and y becomes with a[i].

If I don't swap, x keeps a[i], and y keeps b[i].

I need to decide for each position whether swapping increases the product or not.

But deciding this locally might not be straightforward because it affects the overall values of x and y.

Maybe I need to consider the impact on the product.

Let me think about the mathematical expression for the product.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, each with digits x_n x_{n-1} ... x_0 and y_n y_{n-1} ... y_0.

The product x * y is the sum over all pairs of digits multiplied according to their place values.

But this seems too complicated for direct computation.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that for each position, I should choose the larger digit for the higher positions in both x and y.

But again, I need to balance the digits between x and y.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the digits in descending order for x and y combined, and then assign the largest digits to the most significant positions in both x and y.

For example, take x=3516 and y=3982.

Combined digits: 3,5,1,6,3,9,8,2.

Sorted descending: 9,8,6,5,3,3,2,1.

Then, assign the largest digits to the most significant positions in both x and y.

So, x could be 9631 and y could be 8532.

But in the sample output, it's x=3912 and y=3586.

Wait, but 9631 * 8532 is much larger than 3912 * 3586.

But according to the sample output, it's 3912 and 3586.

So, maybe my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to alternate assigning the largest available digits to x and y.

So, assign the largest digit to the highest position in x, then the next largest to the highest position in y, and so on.

Like, for sorted digits: 9,8,6,5,3,3,2,1.

Assign x: 9,6,3,1

y: 8,5,3,2

So, x=9631, y=8532.

But in the sample output, it's x=3912 and y=3586.

Wait, but 9631 * 8532 is 82125312, which is much larger than 3912 * 3586 = 14043912.

But according to the sample output, it's 3912 and 3586.

So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to keep the digits in their original positions and only swap digits where swapping increases the product.

But how to decide that?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix all digits except one position, and decide whether to swap that position or not.

If swapping that position increases the product, then swap it; else, don't.

But deciding whether swapping a particular position increases the product might still be complicated.

Maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that for positions where a[i] > b[i], I should not swap, and where a[i] < b[i], I should swap.

But in the first sample, a=73, b=31.

For the first digit: 7 > 3, so don't swap.

For the second digit: 3 > 1, so don't swap.

But according to the sample, swapping the second digit gives a higher product.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, 3 is not greater than 1; 3 > 1 is true, so according to this rule, don't swap.

But in the sample, swapping gives a higher product.

So, this rule doesn't hold.

Alternative idea: for positions where a[i] > b[i], don't swap; else, swap.

But in the first sample, for the first digit, 7 > 3, don't swap; for the second digit, 3 > 1, don't swap.

But swapping the second digit gives a higher product.

So, this doesn't work.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the impact on the overall product.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for another approach.

I recall that for two numbers with digits summed to the same total, to maximize their product, they should be as close as possible.

Wait, but in this problem, the digits are fixed; I can only swap corresponding digits between x and y.

So, perhaps I need to make x and y as close as possible, given the constraints of swapping only corresponding digits.

But in the first sample, swapping makes x and y closer, from 73 and 31 to 71 and 33, which are closer together.

Similarly, in the third sample, x=3516 and y=3982 become x=3912 and y=3586, which are closer together.

So, perhaps making x and y closer increases their product.

I recall that for two numbers with a fixed sum, their product is maximized when they are equal.

So, perhaps I should aim to make x and y as close as possible.

In that case, I should swap digits where swapping makes x and y closer.

Is that the case?

Let me test this idea.

Take x=73 and y=31.

Their sum is 73 + 31 = 104.

If I swap the second digits, x becomes 71 and y becomes 33, sum is still 104, but they are closer together, and their product is higher.

Similarly, in the third sample, x=3516 and y=3982 sum to 7498.

After swapping, x=3912 and y=3586 sum to the same, but they are closer together, and the product increases.

So, this seems to hold.

Therefore, my strategy should be to make x and y as close as possible by swapping corresponding digits where swapping reduces the difference between x and y.

Is this always true?

Let me consider another example.

Take x=9 and y=1. Sum is 10.

If I swap, x=1 and y=9, sum is still 10, but now they are farther apart, and product is 9, same as before.

So, no change.

Another example: x=5 and y=5. They are already equal, product is 25.

If I swap, they remain 5 and 5, product is still 25.

So, no change.

Another example: x=6 and y=4. Sum is 10.

Product is 24.

If I swap, x=4 and y=6, sum is 10, product is 24, same as before.

So, in this case, swapping doesn't change the product.

But in the first sample, swapping increased the product.

Wait, but in the case where x and y are equal, swapping doesn't change the product.

When x and y are unequal, swapping can make them closer or farther, affecting the product.

But in the first sample, swapping made them closer and increased the product.

So, perhaps the general rule is to swap digits where a[i] > b[i] if swapping reduces the difference between x and y.

But how to determine that for each digit?

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the numbers as strings of digits and try to maximize their product.

But since the numbers can be up to 100 digits, I need an efficient algorithm.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting to maximize the product by making local decisions for each digit position.

Let me analyze the given program to see if it implements the correct logic.

The program defines a function func() that processes each test case.

It reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads x and y as lists of integers (digits).

Then, it initializes two new lists, new and new2, to store the digits of x and y after swaps.

It starts with i=0 and iterates through the digits.

While i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i], it sets new[i] to the maximum of a[i] and b[i], and new2[i] to the minimum of a[i] and b[i].

Then, it increments i.

Once it finds a position where a[i] != b[i], it sets new[i] to the maximum of a[i] and b[i], and new2[i] to the minimum of a[i] and b[i], and then for the remaining positions, it sets new[i] to the minimum of a[i] and b[i], and new2[i] to the maximum of a[i] and b[i].

Finally, it prints the two numbers formed by new and new2.

Wait, that seems odd.

Let me look at the code again.

Here's the relevant part:

```

i = 0

while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:

new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])

new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

i += 1

if i != len(a):

new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])

new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

i += 1

while i < len(a):

new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])

i += 1

```

So, it processes digits where a[i] == b[i] by assigning the larger digit to new and the smaller to new2.

Then, when it finds a position where a[i] != b[i], it assigns the larger digit to new and the smaller to new2 for that position, and then for all remaining positions, it assigns the smaller digit to new and the larger to new2.

I need to verify if this logic correctly maximizes the product.

Let's test it with the first sample input: a=[7,3], b=[3,1].

Starting with i=0:

a[0] == b[0]? 7 != 3, so it doesn't enter the while loop.

Then, since i != len(a), it sets new[0] = max(7,3)=7, new2[0]=min(7,3)=3.

Then, i=1.

Now, a[1]=3, b[1]=1.

Set new[1] = min(3,1)=1, new2[1]=max(3,1)=3.

So, new=[7,1], new2=[3,3].

Which matches the sample output: 71 and 33.

And indeed, 71*33=2343, which is higher than 73*31=2263.

So, in this case, it works.

Another test: a=[2], b=[5].

i=0:

a[0]==b[0]? 2 != 5, so set new[0]=max(2,5)=5, new2[0]=min(2,5)=2.

Then, i=1, which is out of bounds, so it stops.

So, new=[5], new2=[2], which matches the sample output: 5 and 2.

Product is 10, same as original.

Now, third sample: a=[3,5,1,6], b=[3,9,8,2].

i=0:

a[0]==b[0]? 3 == 3, so set new[0]=max(3,3)=3, new2[0]=min(3,3)=3.

i=1:

a[1]==b[1]? 5 != 9, so set new[1]=max(5,9)=9, new2[1]=min(5,9)=5.

i=2:

Set new[2]=min(1,8)=1, new2[2]=max(1,8)=8.

i=3:

Set new[3]=min(6,2)=2, new2[3]=max(6,2)=6.

So, new=[3,9,1,2], new2=[3,5,8,6], which matches the sample output: 3912 and 3586.

Their product is 3912*3586=14043912.

Without any swaps, 3516*3982=14007912, which is lower.

So, the program gives the correct output for this case.

Let me try another example to verify.

Suppose x=1234, y=4321.

According to the program:

a=[1,2,3,4], b=[4,3,2,1].

i=0:

a[0]==b[0]? 1 != 4, so set new[0]=max(1,4)=4, new2[0]=min(1,4)=1.

i=1:

Set new[1]=min(2,3)=2, new2[1]=max(2,3)=3.

i=2:

Set new[2]=min(3,2)=2, new2[2]=max(3,2)=3.

i=3:

Set new[3]=min(4,1)=1, new2[3]=max(4,1)=4.

So, new=[4,2,2,1], new2=[1,3,3,4].

Thus, x=4221, y=1334.

Product is 4221*1334=5624514.

Without any swaps, x=1234*4321=5332114.

So, with swaps, the product increases.

Is there a better product possible?

If I try x=4321, y=1234, product is 4321*1234=5332114, which is lower.

If I swap different digits, say x=4312, y=1234, product is 4312*1234=5324512, which is lower than 5624514.

So, the program's output seems better.

Another example: x=555, y=555.

a=[5,5,5], b=[5,5,5].

i=0:

a[0]==b[0]? 5==5, set new[0]=5, new2[0]=5.

i=1:

a[1]==b[1]? 5==5, set new[1]=5, new2[1]=5.

i=2:

a[2]==b[2]? 5==5, set new[2]=5, new2[2]=5.

So, x=555, y=555, product remains the same.

Correct, as swapping doesn't change the numbers.

Another example: x=123, y=321.

a=[1,2,3], b=[3,2,1].

i=0:

a[0]==b[0]? 1 != 3, set new[0]=3, new2[0]=1.

i=1:

Set new[1]=min(2,2)=2, new2[1]=max(2,2)=2.

i=2:

Set new[2]=min(3,1)=1, new2[2]=max(3,1)=3.

So, x=321, y=123.

Product is 321*123=39483.

Without swaps, x=123*321=39483, same product.

Is there a better product?

If I swap only the first digit: x=323, y=121. Product is 323*121=39183, which is lower.

Swap only the second digit: x=123, y=321, same as original.

Swap only the third digit: x=121, y=323. Product is 121*323=39183, lower.

Swap first and third digits
