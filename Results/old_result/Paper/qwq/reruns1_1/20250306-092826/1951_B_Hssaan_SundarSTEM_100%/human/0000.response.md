Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between the cows in positions 1 and 2. Then, each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line. The cow with the higher rating always wins.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets. I can choose to swap my cow with any other cow's position exactly once, or choose not to swap at all.

Given multiple test cases, for each case, I need to output the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve with the best possible swap.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses and how my cow's position affects its wins.

Let's consider the initial setup:

- Positions: 1, 2, 3, ..., n

- Ratings: a1, a2, a3, ..., an

- All ai are distinct.

The tournament proceeds as follows:

1. Match 1: Position 1 vs Position 2. The higher-rated cow wins.

2. Match 2: The winner of Match 1 vs Position 3.

3. ...

4. Match n-1: The winner of Match n-2 vs Position n.

My goal is to maximize the number of wins for cow k.

Optionally, I can swap cow k with any other cow's position exactly once.

I need to decide whether to swap and, if so, with whom, to maximize cow k's wins.

Let me think about how cow k can participate in the matches.

Cow k can only participate if it is in one of the positions that gets to play in the matches.

Initially, cow k is in position k.

But I can swap it with any other position.

So, by swapping, I can place cow k in any position I choose.

I need to choose the best position for cow k to maximize its wins.

Alternatively, I can choose not to swap and let cow k stay in its original position.

So, I need to compare the number of wins cow k can achieve in its original position versus in other positions after swapping.

But since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me try to model the tournament.

The tournament is essentially a single-elimination tournament where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

The tournament proceeds in a specific order: first match between pos1 and pos2, then the winner plays pos3, and so on.

So, the sequence of opponents for the initial winner is determined by the order of positions.

I need to see how cow k can be placed in this sequence to maximize its wins.

Option 1: Keep cow k in its original position.

Option 2: Swap cow k to some other position p.

Then, in the tournament, cow k will be in position p, and the matches will proceed accordingly.

I need to calculate, for each possible position p, how many wins cow k can achieve if placed there.

But since n is up to 10^5, and t up to 10^4, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the tournament is essentially a linked list of matches, where each match depends on the previous one.

But perhaps I can model it as a tree or some other structure.

Wait, actually, it's a linear sequence.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of cow k, say position p.

Then, in the tournament, cow k will participate starting from match p-1 or so.

Wait, let's think step by step.

If I place cow k in position p, then:

- If p == 1, cow k plays against cow in pos2.

- If p > 1, cow k plays against the winner of the previous match (which is match p-1).

And so on.

I need to see how many matches cow k can win from its position p.

But this seems a bit involved.

Let me consider that the tournament can be modeled as follows:

- There is a current winner, starting from pos1.

- It plays against pos2, then the winner plays pos3, and so on.

So, the current winner advances until it loses.

I need to place cow k in a position such that it can win as many matches as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of how many cows have higher ratings than cow k.

Because cow k can keep winning as long as it faces cows with lower ratings.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that come after cow k in the sequence.

But wait, it's not that simple because the sequence of matches is determined by the initial positions.

Let me consider that if I place cow k in position p, then it will face the winner of the previous matches.

So, I need to know what is the rating of the winner who reaches match p.

Then, if cow k's rating is higher, it wins, and continues.

Otherwise, it loses, and that's the end.

So, for each possible position p, I need to know:

- What is the rating of the winner who reaches match p.

- If cow k's rating is higher, it wins this match and proceeds to the next one.

- Repeat until it loses.

So, the number of wins is the number of consecutive cows it can defeat, starting from position p.

But again, this seems O(n) per test case if done naively.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the tournament has a specific order, and the winner of each match is the one with the higher rating.

Given that all ratings are unique, there are no ties.

So, the tournament can be thought of as a sequence of matches where the current winner faces the next cow.

I need to maximize the number of wins for cow k by choosing its position wisely.

Let me consider that if I place cow k in position p, then it will face the winner of the first p-1 matches.

So, I need to know who the winner would be after the first p-1 matches.

Then, if cow k has a higher rating than this winner, it wins and proceeds to face the next cow, and so on.

Otherwise, it loses immediately.

So, for each possible p, I need to know:

- The rating of the winner after the first p-1 matches.

- If cow k's rating is higher, it wins match p.

- Then, it becomes the current winner and faces match p+1, and so on.

I need to find the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve by choosing the best p.

But calculating this for each p seems too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the winner after the first p-1 matches is the cow with the highest rating among the first p-1 cows.

Because the highest-rated cow always wins.

Wait, no.

Actually, since it's a sequential tournament where each match is between the current winner and the next cow, the winner is the one with the higher rating.

So, the winner after p-1 matches is the cow with the highest rating among the first p cows.

Wait, no.

Let me think carefully.

Suppose we have cows in positions 1 to n, with ratings a1 to an.

Match 1: pos1 vs pos2. Winner is the one with higher ai.

Match 2: winner of match1 vs pos3. Again, higher ai wins.

And so on.

So, the winner after p matches is the cow with the highest rating among the first p+1 cows.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me take an example.

Suppose n=3, cows with ratings a1, a2, a3.

Match1: pos1 vs pos2. Winner is max(a1,a2).

Match2: winner of match1 vs pos3. So, winner is max(max(a1,a2), a3), which is max(a1,a2,a3).

So, yes, the final winner is the cow with the highest rating.

But I need to see what is the winner at each step.

Wait, but for my purpose, I need to know, for a given position p, what is the rating of the winner who reaches match p.

So, for position p, the opponent is the winner of the first p-1 matches.

Which is the cow with the highest rating among the first p-1 cows.

Wait, no.

Wait, in match p, the opponent is the winner of match p-1.

Which is the winner of the first p-1 matches.

Which is the cow with the highest rating among the first p cows.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Let me define W(p) as the winner of the first p matches.

Then:

W(1) = max(a1, a2)

W(2) = max(W(1), a3)

...

W(p) = max(W(p-1), a[p+1])

So, W(p) = max(a1, a2, ..., a[p+1])

Wait, no.

Wait, in match 1: pos1 vs pos2, winner is max(a1,a2)

Match 2: winner of match1 vs pos3, which is max(max(a1,a2), a3) = max(a1,a2,a3)

Match 3: winner of match2 vs pos4, which is max(max(a1,a2,a3), a4) = max(a1,a2,a3,a4)

And so on.

So, the winner after p matches is the cow with the highest rating among the first p+1 cows.

Wait, more precisely, after p matches, the current winner is the cow with the highest rating among the first p+1 cows.

Because each match introduces a new cow, and the winner is the highest-rated among all so far.

So, after p matches, the current winner is the cow with the highest rating among the first p+1 cows.

Therefore, in match p+1, the opponent for the current winner is pos[p+2], but I need to think in terms of the position where cow k is placed.

This is getting a bit tangled.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I place cow k in position p.

Then, in the tournament:

- Matches 1 to p-1: involve cows in positions 1 to p.

- The winner of these matches is the highest-rated among positions 1 to p.

- Then, in match p, cow k (now in position p) plays against this winner.

If cow k's rating is higher, it wins and becomes the new current winner.

Then, in match p+1, cow k plays against position p+1, and so on.

So, starting from position p, cow k can win matches as long as its rating is higher than the opponents it faces.

The opponents are:

- The winner of the first p-1 matches (which is the highest-rated among positions 1 to p-1)

- Then position p+1

- Then position p+2

- And so on

Wait, but actually, after winning match p, cow k becomes the current winner and faces position p+1 in match p+1, and so on.

So, to maximize the number of wins for cow k, I need to choose position p such that:

- The winner of the first p-1 matches (highest among positions 1 to p-1) has a lower rating than cow k.

- And cow k has higher rating than as many subsequent cows as possible.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that if I place cow k in position p, the number of wins is:

- 0, if cow k loses match p (i.e., its rating is lower than the winner of the first p-1 matches)

- Otherwise, it wins match p, and then wins match p+1 if its rating is higher than position p+1, and so on.

So, the number of wins is the number of consecutive cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k, plus one for winning match p.

But wait, not quite.

Because the opponent in match p is the winner of the first p-1 matches, which is the highest among positions 1 to p-1.

So, to win match p, cow k must have a higher rating than the highest among positions 1 to p-1.

If it does, then it proceeds to match p+1, where it plays against position p+1.

If it wins, it plays against position p+2, and so on.

So, the number of wins is:

- 0, if cow k's rating <= highest among positions 1 to p-1

- Otherwise, 1 + number of consecutive cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k.

So, for each possible p, the number of wins is:

- 0, if max(a1 to a[p-1]) >= a[k]

- Else, 1 + length of the largest suffix starting from p+1 where a[i] < a[k]

I need to maximize this over all p.

Moreover, I need to consider that I can choose to swap cow k with any position p, or choose not to swap.

Wait, actually, in the problem, it's allowed to swap cow k with any other cow's position, meaning that cow k can be placed in any position p, replacing the cow that was originally there.

So, I need to choose p, and place cow k in position p, replacing the original cow there.

Then, the tournament proceeds as usual, with cow k in position p.

So, for each p, I need to calculate the number of wins for cow k if placed in position p.

Then, choose the p that maximizes this number.

But calculating this for each p seems too slow for n up to 10^5 per test case.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider precomputing some values.

For example, precompute for each p, the highest rating among positions 1 to p-1.

Then, for each p, if a[k] > highest among positions 1 to p-1, then cow k can win match p and proceed.

Then, the number of wins is 1 plus the number of consecutive positions after p where a[i] < a[k].

Otherwise, it's 0.

So, for each p, I can compute:

wins[p] = 0 if a[k] <= max(a[1] to a[p-1])

else wins[p] = 1 + length of the longest suffix starting from p+1 where a[i] < a[k]

Then, the maximum wins is the maximum over all p of wins[p]

But computing this naively is O(n) per test case, which might be too slow for t=10^4 and n=10^5.

I need a way to compute this faster.

Let me think about precomputing the maximums.

Let me precompute prefix_max[p] = max(a[1] to a[p-1])

Then, for each p, if a[k] > prefix_max[p], then wins[p] = 1 + length of the longest suffix starting from p+1 where a[i] < a[k]

else wins[p] = 0

Now, I need to compute for each p, the length of the longest suffix starting from p+1 where a[i] < a[k]

This can be precomputed as well.

Let me define suffix_length[p] = length of the longest suffix starting from p where a[i] < a[k]

But that's not exactly what I need.

Wait, I need the length starting from p+1.

So, suffix_length[p] = length of the longest suffix starting from p+1 where a[i] < a[k]

This can be precomputed by iterating from the end to the beginning.

For example, starting from p = n:

if a[p] < a[k], then suffix_length[p] = 1 + suffix_length[p+1]

else, suffix_length[p] = 0

With suffix_length[n] = 0 if a[n] >= a[k], else 1

Wait, a[n] is position n.

But positions are 1 to n.

Wait, in 0-indexing, positions are 0 to n-1.

I need to be careful with indexing.

Let me assume 0-based indexing for simplicity.

So, positions are 0 to n-1

a[0] to a[n-1]

k is 1 to n, so k-1 in 0-based indexing.

Then, prefix_max[p] = max(a[0] to a[p-1]), for p >=1

prefix_max[0] is undefined or can be set to -infinity

Then, for each p from 0 to n-1:

if a[k-1] > prefix_max[p]:

wins[p] = 1 + suffix_length[p+1]

else:

wins[p] = 0

Where suffix_length[p] = number of consecutive a[i] < a[k-1] starting from p

Computed as:

for p from n-1 downto 0:

if a[p] < a[k-1]:

suffix_length[p] = 1 + suffix_length[p+1]

else:

suffix_length[p] = 0

With suffix_length[n] = 0

Then, for each p from 0 to n-1:

if a[k-1] > prefix_max[p]:

wins[p] = 1 + suffix_length[p+1]

else:

wins[p] = 0

Then, the maximum wins is the maximum over p of wins[p]

This seems efficient, as it's O(n) per test case.

But in the problem, I can swap cow k to any position p, including its original position.

So, I need to consider all p from 0 to n-1.

Wait, but in the original setup, cow k is at position k-1.

If I choose to swap cow k with another position, say position p, then cow k is now at position p, and the original cow at p is moved elsewhere.

But in the program provided, it seems to only consider swapping cow k to position 0 or to some other position p.

Wait, let's look at the given program to understand what it's doing.

Given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

s = list(map(int, input().split()))

(s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])

ans = 0

h = s[0]

j = -1

for i in s[1:]:

j += 1

if h < i:

break

else:

ans += 1

p = j + 1

(s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])

ans1 = 0

(s[p], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[p])

z = 0

for i in s:

if i == h:

if s[0] != h:

ans1 += 1

z = 1

elif i > h:

break

elif z == 1:

ans1 += 1

print(max(ans, ans1))

So, it seems to consider two scenarios:

1. Swapping cow k to position 0.

2. Swapping cow k to position p, where p is determined based on the first swap.

But this seems too specific and might not cover all possible optimal swaps.

I need to verify if this program correctly implements the logic I described earlier.

Wait, perhaps the program is trying to simulate placing cow k in position 0 and in another position p, and then choosing the better one.

But it's not clear.

I need to verify if this program correctly maximizes the number of wins for cow k.

Let me consider the first test case from the example:

Input:

3

6 1

12 10 14 11 8 3

6 5

7 2 727 10 12 13

2 2

1000000000 1

Output:

1

2

0

Let me see what the program does for the first test case.

n=6, k=1

s = [12,10,14,11,8,3]

It swaps s[0] and s[0], so s remains [12,10,14,11,8,3]

Then, h = s[0] = 12

j = -1

Loop through s[1:] = [10,14,11,8,3]

i=10, j=0, 12 < 10? No, so ans +=1, ans=1

i=14, j=1, 12 < 14? Yes, break

So, p = j +1 =2

Then, swap s[0] and s[0] again, so s remains [12,10,14,11,8,3]

Then, swap s[2] and s[0], so s becomes [14,10,12,11,8,3]

Then, z=0

Loop through s:

i=14, i == h=12? No, i > h=12? 14 >12, so break

ans1 =0

So, max(ans, ans1)=max(1,0)=1, which matches the first output.

Second test case:

n=6, k=5

s=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

Swap s[0] and s[4], so s becomes [12,2,727,10,7,13]

h=12

j=-1

Loop through [2,727,10,7,13]

i=2, j=0, 12 <2? No, ans+=1, ans=1

i=727, j=1, 12 <727? Yes, break

p=2

Swap s[0] and s[4] back, s becomes [7,2,727,10,12,13]

Then swap s[2] and s[4], s becomes [7,2,12,10,727,13]

Then z=0

Loop through s:

i=7, i==h=12? No, i>h=12? 7<12, z=0, so no action

i=2, i==12? No, i>12? 2<12, z=0, so no action

i=12, i==12, s[0]!=12, so ans1+=1, z=1

i=10, i==12? No, i>12? 10<12, z=1, so ans1+=1, ans1=2

i=727, i==12? No, i>12? Yes, break

So, max(2, ans)=max(2, ans)

Wait, ans was not computed in this case.

Wait, in the first part, ans was set to the number of wins if swapping to position 0, which was 1.

Then, ans1 is set to 2, so max(1,2)=2, which matches the second output.

Third test case:

n=2, k=2

s=[1000000000,1]

Swap s[0] and s[1], s becomes [1,1000000000]

h=1

j=-1

Loop through [1000000000], 1 < 1000000000? Yes, break

So, p=0+1=1

Swap s[0] and s[1] back, s=[1000000000,1]

Then swap s[1] and s[1], so s remains [1000000000,1]

Then z=0

Loop through s:

i=1000000000, i==h=1? No, i>1? Yes, break

ans1=0

So, max(0,ans)=0, which matches the third output.

So, in these cases, it seems to work.

But is this logic general?

In the program, it seems to consider two scenarios:

1. Swap cow k to position 0.

Compute the number of wins in this scenario (ans)

2. Swap cow k to position p, where p is determined based on the first scenario.

Compute the number of wins in this scenario (ans1)

Then, take the maximum of ans and ans1.

But I'm not sure if this covers all possible optimal swaps.

Perhaps there is a better position to swap cow k to, other than position 0 or position p determined in the first scenario.

I need to verify if this program always finds the maximum number of wins.

Let me think of a test case where it might fail.

Suppose n=4, k=3

s=[5,10,3,8]

Original positions: 0:5, 1:10, 2:3, 3:8

If I swap cow k (position 2, rating 3) to position 0, s becomes [3,10,5,8]

Then, h=3

Loop through [10], 3 <10, break

p=1

Then, swap s[0] and s[2] back, s=[5,10,3,8]

Then, swap s[1] and s[2], s=[5,3,10,8]

Then, h=3

Loop through [5,3,10,8]

i=5, i==3? No, i>3? 5>3, break

ans1=0

So, max(ans, ans1)=max(0,0)=0

But is this the maximum?

Wait, if I place cow k in position 3, s becomes [5,10,8,3]

Then, in the tournament:

Match1: 5 vs 10, winner 10

Match2: 10 vs 8, winner 10

Match3: 10 vs 3, winner 10

Cow k (rating 3) never plays.

Alternatively, if I place cow k in position 1, s=[10,3,5,8]

Match1:10 vs 3, winner 10

Match2:10 vs 5, winner 10

Match3:10 vs 8, winner 10

Again, cow k never plays.

Wait, in this case, cow k has a low rating and can't win against higher-rated cows.

So, the maximum number of wins is indeed 0.

So, in this case, the program correctly outputs 0.

Another test case:

n=5, k=2

s=[1,100,2,99,3]

If I swap cow k (position 1, rating 100) to position 0, s=[100,1,2,99,3]

h=100

Loop through [1,2,99,3]

1<100, ans+=1

2<100, ans+=1

99>100, break

p=2

Then, swap s[0] and s[1] back, s=[1,100,2,99,3]

Then, swap s[2] and s[1], s=[1,2,100,99,3]

Then, h=100

Loop through [1,2,100,99,3]

i=1<100, ans1+=1

i=2<100, ans1+=1

i=100==h, s[0]!=h, ans1+=1, z=1

i=99<100, z=1, ans1+=1

i=3<100, z=1, ans1+=1

So, ans1=4

Original ans=2

max(2,4)=4

But is this the maximum?

If I place cow k in position 1, s=[1,100,2,99,3]

Match1:1 vs 100, winner 100

Match2:100 vs 2, winner 100

Match3:100 vs 99, winner 100

Match4:100 vs 3, winner 100

Cow k wins 4 matches.

If I place cow k in position 0, s=[100,1,2,99,3]

Match1:100 vs 1, winner 100

Match2:100 vs 2, winner 100

Match3:100 vs 99, winner 100

Match4:100 vs 3, winner 100

Cow k wins 4 matches.

If I place cow k in position 2, s=[1,2,100,99,3]

Match1:1 vs 2, winner 2

Match2:2 vs 100, winner 100

Match3:100 vs 99, winner 100

Match4:100 vs 3, winner 100

Cow k wins 2 matches.

If I place cow k in position 3, s=[1,2,99,100,3]

Match1:1 vs 2, winner 2

Match2:2 vs 99, winner 99

Match3:99 vs 100, winner 100

Match4:100 vs 3, winner 100

Cow k wins 1 match.

If I place cow k in position 4, s=[1,2,99,3,100]

Match1:1 vs 2, winner 2

Match2:2 vs 99, winner 99

Match3:99 vs 3, winner 99

Match4:99 vs 100, winner 100

Cow k wins 1 match.

So, indeed, placing cow k in position 0 or position 1 gives 4 wins, which is the maximum.

The program seems to capture this.

Another test case:

n=5, k=3

s=[100,99,1,101,2]

If I swap cow k (position 2, rating 1) to position 0, s=[1,99,100,101,2]

h=1

Loop through [99], 1 <99, break

p=1

Then, swap s[0] and s[2], s=[100,99,1,101,2]

Then, swap s[1] and s[2], s=[100,1,99,101,2]

Then, h=1

Loop through [100,1,99,101,2]

i=100 >1, break

ans1=0

So, max(ans, ans1)=max(0,0)=0

But is this the maximum?

If I place cow k in position 4, s=[100,99,101,1,2]

Match1:100 vs 99, winner 100

Match2:100 vs 101, winner 101

Match3:101 vs 1, winner 101

Match4:101 vs 2, winner 101

Cow k wins 0 matches.

Similarly, in other positions, cow k can't win any matches because it has the lowest rating.

So, again, the program correctly outputs 0.

Seems like the program is working correctly in these cases.

Let me see if I can find a case where it fails.

Consider n=5, k=3, s=[5,4,10,6,7]

If I swap cow k (position 2, rating 10) to position 0, s=[10,4,5,6,7]

h=10

Loop through [4,5,6,7]

4<10, ans+=1

5<10, ans+=1

6<10, ans+=1

7<10, ans+=1

p=4

Then, swap s[0] and s[2] back, s=[5,4,10,6,7]

Then, swap s[4] and s[2], s=[5,4,7,6,10]

Then, h=10

Loop through [5,4,7,6,10]

i=5<10, ans1+=1

i=4<10, ans1+=1

i=7<10, ans1+=1

i=6<10, ans1+=1

i=10==h, s[0]!=h, ans1+=1, z=1

So, ans1=5

Original ans=4

max(4,5)=5

But in reality, if I place cow k in position 0, s=[10,4,5,6,7]

Match1:10 vs 4, winner 10

Match2:10 vs 5, winner 10

Match3:10 vs 6, winner 10

Match4:10 vs 7, winner 10

Cow k wins 4 matches.

If I place cow k in position 1, s=[5,10,4,6,7]

Match1:5 vs 10, winner 10

Match2:10 vs 4, winner 10

Match3:10 vs 6, winner 10

Match4:10 vs 7, winner 10

Cow k wins 4 matches.

If I place cow k in position 2, s=[5,4,10,6,7]

Match1:5 vs 4, winner 5

Match2:5 vs 10, winner 10

Match3:10 vs 6, winner 10

Match4:10 vs 7, winner 10

Cow k wins 3 matches.

If I place cow k in position 3, s=[5,4,6,10,7]

Match1:5 vs 4, winner 5

Match2:5 vs 6, winner 6

Match3:6 vs 10, winner 10

Match4:10 vs 7, winner 10

Cow k wins 1 match.

If I place cow k in position 4, s=[5,4,6,7,10]

Match1:5 vs 4, winner 5

Match2:5 vs 6, winner 6

Match3:6 vs 7, winner 7

Match4:7 vs 10, winner 10

Cow k wins 1 match.

So, the maximum is 4, but the program outputs 5.

Wait, why is that?

Looking back, in the program, ans=4 (from swapping to position 0)

ans1=5 (from some other swap)

But in reality, cow k can't win more than 4 matches in any position.

So, the program is overcounting in this case.

Looking at the code:

After swapping s[0] and s[k-1], it computes ans based on s[0] being cow k.

Then, it swaps s[0] and s[k-1] back.

Then, it swaps s[p] and s[k-1], where p is determined from the first swap.

Then, it computes ans1 based on s[0] being something else.

But in this case, it seems to count ans1=5, which is incorrect.

So, the program is flawed in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of wins for a specific cow (cow k) in a coding tournament by potentially swapping its position once or choosing not to swap. The tournament structure involves sequential matches where the winner proceeds to the next match.

### Approach

1. **Initial Setup and Swapping Consideration**:
   - We need to consider both keeping cow k in its original position and swapping it to different positions to maximize its wins.
   
2. **Computing Wins for Different Positions**:
   - For each possible position p where cow k can be placed, calculate the number of wins cow k can achieve.
   - This involves determining if cow k can defeat the winner of the previous matches and then how many subsequent cows it can defeat.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Precompute the maximum rating before each position to determine the winner of previous matches.
   - Precompute the length of consecutive cows with lower ratings after each position to count the wins efficiently.

4. **Maximize Wins**:
   - For each position p, compute the number of wins if cow k is placed at p and choose the position that gives the maximum wins.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        # Original position of cow k
        k_pos = k - 1
        # Rating of cow k
        h = a[k_pos]
        
        # Precompute prefix_max[p] = max(a[0] to a[p-1])
        prefix_max = [0] * (n + 1)
        current_max = -1
        for p in range(1, n + 1):
            if p - 1 < n:
                current_max = max(current_max, a[p - 1])
            prefix_max[p] = current_max
        
        # Precompute suffix_length[p] = length of the longest suffix starting from p where a[i] < h
        suffix_length = [0] * (n + 1)
        for p in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if a[p] < h:
                suffix_length[p] = 1 + suffix_length[p + 1]
            else:
                suffix_length[p] = 0
        
        # Compute the maximum number of wins
        max_wins = 0
        for p in range(n):
            if h > prefix_max[p]:
                wins = 1 + suffix_length[p + 1]
                max_wins = max(max_wins, wins)
        
        print(max_wins)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Precomputing Prefix Maximums**:
   - `prefix_max[p]` stores the maximum rating among the first `p-1` cows. This helps determine the opponent's rating in match `p`.

2. **Precomputing Suffix Lengths**:
   - `suffix_length[p]` stores the number of consecutive cows starting from position `p+1` with ratings less than cow k's rating. This helps in counting how many wins cow k can achieve after winning the initial match.

3. **Calculating Maximum Wins**:
   - For each possible position `p`, if cow k's rating is greater than the prefix maximum up to `p-1`, it can win match `p` and subsequently win matches against the next `suffix_length[p+1]` cows.
   - Track the maximum number of wins across all possible positions `p`.

This approach ensures an efficient solution within the given constraints, providing the optimal number of wins for cow k.
