Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game on a tree where Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone from one node to another, activating nodes as they go. The game ends when a player can't make a move, and that player loses. I need to figure out who wins each round if they both play optimally.

First, let's understand the problem setup. There's a tree with n nodes, and the game consists of t rounds. In each round, the stone starts on a specific node, and players alternate moves until no more moves are possible. The tree is the same for all rounds, but the starting node can be different for each round.

Given that t=1 in this medium version, I only need to handle one round, which simplifies things a bit. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, and the starting node for the round is given.

Now, the key here is to determine the winner assuming both players play optimally. This sounds like a game theory problem, specifically a impartial game where the structure is a tree.

In game theory, particularly in impartial games like this, the concept of "Nimbers" or "grundy numbers" can be used to determine the winner. However, since the game is played on a tree, and the activation of nodes affects future moves, I need to model this appropriately.

Let me think about the game rules again:

- The stone starts on one node, which is activated.

- A move consists of moving the stone from the current node to an inactive neighbor, activating that neighbor.

- Players alternate moves until no more moves are possible.

- The player who cannot make a move loses.

So, the game is essentially about traversing the tree, activating nodes one by one, and the player who gets stuck with no possible moves loses.

This resembles a type of game called "node Kayles" or "vertex nim", where players take turns choosing vertices, and certain constraints apply based on the graph structure.

Given that the graph is a tree, perhaps I can use some properties of trees to simplify the analysis.

First, let's consider the structure of a tree. A tree is an acyclic connected graph, meaning there are no loops, and all nodes are connected.

In this game, since players can only move to inactive neighbors, it's like traversing the tree without revisiting nodes.

Wait, but it's not exactly a traversal because they have to move to inactive neighbors, meaning once a node is activated, it can't be used again for moving the stone.

This seems similar to a path in the tree, where each move extends the path by one node.

But actually, it's more general because the players can move to any inactive neighbor, not necessarily extending a single path.

Wait, no. Since the tree is connected and acyclic, any move to an inactive neighbor will extend the "active" part of the tree.

I need to think in terms of game positions and who has a winning strategy.

Let me try to model this game recursively.

Define the game state based on the current node with the stone and the set of activated nodes.

But that might be too complex. Maybe I can think in terms of subtrees.

Given that it's a tree, I can choose a root and consider subtrees.

Wait, actually, since the starting node is given for each round, I can consider the tree rooted at the starting node for that round.

Then, the game involves moving down the tree to inactive children.

But wait, in trees, directions matter based on the root.

Let me formalize this.

Let's root the tree at the starting node for the current round.

Then, each move consists of moving the stone from the current node to one of its inactive children.

This way, the game progresses by activating nodes in a way that resembles a depth-first search.

Given that, the game can be modeled as a tree where each node has a certain number of inactive children, and players choose to move to one of these children.

This resembles the game of Nim, where each pile corresponds to a subtree, and the height of the pile is the number of moves possible in that subtree.

Wait, but it's not exactly Nim because the moves are restricted to choosing one child at a time, not removing objects from piles.

Actually, this game is more similar to "Nimber" or "mex" values in game theory.

I need to compute the "grundy number" for each node, which represents the mex of the grundy numbers of its children.

In this context, the grundy number for a node would be the mex of the grundy numbers of its inactive children.

But since the game progresses by activating nodes, I need to consider the grundy number for each subtree.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the grundy number for each subtree as the game value.

Then, the overall game value is the XOR of the grundy numbers of all subtrees.

If the XOR is non-zero, the first player wins; otherwise, the second player wins.

But in this case, since there's only one starting node and the game is played on the entire tree, it's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the grundy number for the starting node.

If the grundy number is non-zero, Ron (the first player) wins; otherwise, Hermione (the second player) wins.

So, I need to compute the grundy number for the starting node, considering the tree structure.

To compute the grundy number for a node, I need to consider the grundy numbers of its children and find the mex of those values.

But in this game, moving to a child activates it, and then the subgame continues from that child.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the grundy number for each subtree size.

Actually, in this game, the number of moves possible from a node is equal to the number of its inactive children.

Wait, but it's not just the number of children; it's the number of inactive children.

But as the game progresses, children get activated, reducing the number of possible moves.

This seems more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of leaves or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the parity of the number of moves.

Let me think differently.

The total number of moves in the game is equal to the number of nodes minus one, since each move activates one new node, and starting from one node, we activate n-1 nodes in total.

But, the players alternate moves, so if n-1 is odd, Ron makes the last move and Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

If n-1 is even, Hermione makes the last move and Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic.

Is this always the case?

Wait, no. This would only be true if the game was simply activating all nodes one by one in a linear fashion.

But in a tree, the game can branch, and the order of moves matters.

For example, consider a tree where the starting node has two children, each leading to a separate subtree.

The players can choose to move to one subtree or the other.

This is similar to the game of Nim with two heaps.

In Nim, the first player wins if the XOR of the heap sizes is non-zero.

Similarly, here, I need to compute the grundy number for each subtree and XOR them to get the game value.

But in this problem, since t=1 and we have only one starting node, it's just one tree, so the game value is the grundy number of the starting node.

If the grundy number is non-zero, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

So, I need to compute the grundy number for the starting node.

To compute the grundy number for a node, I need to consider the grundy numbers of its children.

Wait, but in this game, moving to a child activates it, and then the game continues from that child.

So, the grundy number for a node is equal to the mex of the grundy numbers of its children.

Wait, in standard impartial game theory on trees, the grundy number for a node is indeed the mex of the grundy numbers of its children.

But in this game, since moving to a child activates it, and then the subgame continues from that child, this seems to align with the standard definition.

So, perhaps I can compute the grundy number for each node based on its children's grundy numbers.

Then, for the starting node, if its grundy number is non-zero, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

Let me try to compute the grundy numbers for a simple tree.

Take the example input:

5 1

1 2

1 3

3 4

3 5

1

So, the tree is:

1 - 2

|

3 - 4

|

5

Starting at node 1.

Compute grundy numbers:

First, leaf nodes: nodes 2,4,5 have no children, so their grundy number is 0.

Node 3 has children 4 and 5, both with grundy number 0, so mex is 1.

Node 1 has children 2 and 3, with grundy numbers 0 and 1, so mex is 2.

Since grundy number of starting node is 2 (non-zero), Ron wins.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

4 1

1 2

1 3

2 4

1

Tree:

1 - 2 - 4

|

3

Starting at node 1.

Grundy numbers:

Leaves: 3 and 4 have grundy 0.

Node 2 has child 4 with grundy 0, so mex is 1.

Node 1 has children 2 and 3, with grundy 1 and 0, so mex is 2.

Again, grundy > 0, Ron wins.

Another test case:

2 1

1 2

2

Starting at node 2.

Grundy numbers:

Node 2 has one child 1, which has no children, so grundy 0.

So, grundy of node 2 is mex of 0, which is 1.

So, Ron wins.

Wait, but if starting at node 2, Ron moves to node 1, then Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

Yes, consistent.

Another test case:

3 1

1 2

1 3

3

Starting at node 3.

Grundy numbers:

Node 3 has one child 1, which has child 2.

Node 2 has no children, grundy 0.

Node 1 has children 2 and 3, grundy 0 and ..., wait, node 1 has children 2 and 3.

Wait, but starting at node 3, its only child is node 1.

Grundy of node 1 is mex of grundy of node 2 (0) and grundy of node 3 (to be computed).

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to compute grundy numbers in a bottom-up manner.

Start from leaves, compute their grundy numbers, then move up to their parents, and so on, up to the root (starting node).

In code, I can perform a DFS to compute the grundy numbers for each node based on its children.

Then, for the starting node, check if its grundy number is non-zero.

If yes, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

This seems like a feasible approach.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func_1(nodes, start, parent=None):

if len(nodes[start]) == 1 and nodes[start][0] == parent:

return False

distances = []

for node in nodes[start]:

if node != parent:

distances.append(not func_1(nodes, node, start))

return any(distances)

def func_2():

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())

edges = []

empty = True

nodes = defaultdict(list)

for i in range(n - 1):

(u, v) = map(int, input().split())

nodes[u].append(v)

nodes[v].append(u)

leaves = deque()

for key in nodes:

if len(nodes[key]) == 1:

leaves.append(key)

start = int(input())

moves = func_1(nodes, start)

if moves:

print('Ron')

else:

print('Hermione')

So, func_2 reads the input, builds the tree adjacency list, identifies leaves, reads the starting node, calls func_1, and decides who wins based on the return value of func_1.

Func_1 seems to be recursively checking something about the tree.

Let's analyze func_1.

It takes nodes (adjacency list), start (current node), and parent (to avoid cycling).

Base case: if the node has only one neighbor, which is the parent, return False.

Else, for each child (neighbors except parent), recursively call func_1 on them and invert the result (not func_1(...)), and collect these in a list.

Then, return whether any of these inverted results are True.

Wait, that's equivalent to returning not all(distances), because any of the inverted results being True means that not all distances are True.

But let's verify this.

Given that distances.append(not func_1(nodes, node, start)), and then return any(distances).

Any(distances) is True if at least one distance is True, which means at least one child's func_1 returned False.

Wait, so it's checking if there's at least one child where func_1 returns False.

Which means that if there's at least one child that leads to a losing position for the opponent, the current player can win.

This seems consistent with game theory, where a player can choose a move that leads to a losing position for the other player.

In other words, if there exists at least one child where the opponent cannot force a win, then the current player can win by moving there.

This aligns with the concept of Nimbers or grundy numbers, where a node is a winning position if there's at least one child that is a losing position for the opponent.

So, in this context, func_1 seems to be correctly implementing the logic to determine if the current node is a winning position for the player to move.

Returning False when the node is a leaf (only one neighbor, which is the parent), meaning no moves can be made, so it's a losing position.

Otherwise, for each child, if the child is a losing position for the opponent (func_1 returns False), then the current node is a winning position.

So, in func_1, if any child returns False, then the current node returns True (wins for the current player).

Else, returns False (loses).

This seems correct.

Comparing this to grundy numbers:

- A leaf node has grundy 0 (losing position).

- A node with at least one child with grundy 0 has grundy number 1 (winning position).

- A node with all children having grundy >0 has grundy 0 (losing position).

Which matches the logic in func_1.

Therefore, func_1 correctly determines if the starting node is a winning position for Ron.

If func_1 returns True, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

Looking back at the sample input:

5 1

1 2

1 3

3 4

3 5

1

Building the adjacency list:

1: [2,3]

2: [1]

3: [1,4,5]

4: [3]

5: [3]

Start at node 1.

func_1(1, None):

Children: 2 and 3.

func_1(2,1):

2 has only one neighbor 1, so return False.

func_1(3,1):

3 has children 4 and 5.

func_1(4,3):

4 has only one neighbor 3, return False.

func_1(5,3):

5 has only one neighbor 3, return False.

So, distances = [not False, not False] = [True, True]

any(distances) = True

So, func_1(3,1) = True

Then, distances for func_1(1,None) = [not func_1(2,1), not func_1(3,1)] = [not False, not True] = [True, False]

any(distances) = True

So, func_1(1,None) = True, meaning Ron wins.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

4 1

1 2

1 3

2 4

1

Adjacency list:

1: [2,3]

2: [1,4]

3: [1]

4: [2]

Start at 1.

func_1(1,None):

Children: 2 and 3.

func_1(2,1):

Children: 4.

func_1(4,2):

Only neighbor 2, return False.

So, distances = [not False] = [True]

any(distances) = True

So, func_1(2,1) = True

func_1(3,1):

Only neighbor 1, return False.

So, distances for func_1(1,None) = [not True, not False] = [False, True]

any(distances) = True

So, Ron wins.

Another test case:

2 1

1 2

2

Adjacency list:

1: [2]

2: [1]

Start at 2.

func_1(2,None):

Only neighbor 1.

func_1(1,2):

Only neighbor 2, return False.

So, distances = [not False] = [True]

any(distances) = True

So, func_1(2,None) = True, Ron wins.

Seems consistent.

Another test case:

3 1

1 2

1 3

3

Adjacency list:

1: [2,3]

2: [1]

3: [1]

Start at 3.

func_1(3,None):

Only child 1.

func_1(1,3):

Children: 2 and 3.

But 3 is the parent, so only child 2.

func_1(2,1):

Only neighbor 1, return False.

So, distances = [not False] = [True]

any(distances) = True

So, func_1(1,3) = True

Then, distances for func_1(3,None) = [not True] = [False]

any(distances) = False

So, func_1(3,None) = False, Hermione wins.

Is this correct?

Let's see: starting at node 3.

Move to node 1.

Then, Hermione can move to node 2.

Then, Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

Yes, matches the func_1 output.

Therefore, func_1 seems to correctly determine the winner for the starting node.

Additionally, the code builds the adjacency list correctly, reads the input correctly, and calls func_1 with the starting node.

Hence, the provided program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Ron}} \]

**Correctness:** **True**
