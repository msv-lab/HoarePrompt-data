Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears on exactly two cards. The deck is divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, starting with me, for a total of 2n turns. On each turn, the player picks one card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, they place their chosen card on the table.

The problem is asking for the maximum number of points I can get if both Nene and I play optimally, with Nene trying to maximize her score and minimize mine secondarily.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. There are 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing twice. Me and Nene each have n cards. We take turns, starting with me, and on each turn, we play one card. If the number on the card we're playing is already on the table, we get a point.

The key here is that both players can see all the cards on the table at any time, so it's a game of perfect information. Nene is very smart and will always make the best possible move to maximize her score and minimize mine, in that order.

I need to figure out, given my hand of cards, what's the best I can do in terms of points, assuming Nene is playing optimally against me.

Let me think about the example provided:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

Looking at the first test case:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards must be the remaining ones: 2,3,4,4

In the explanation, it shows a sequence of moves where I end up with 1 point and Nene with 3. It also says that I can't do better than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

So, I need to find a general strategy that allows me to maximize my points, knowing that Nene is trying to minimize them.

Let me try to model this.

First, I need to consider that each number appears twice in the deck. So, for each number, there are two cards: one with that number.

In my hand, I have some numbers, and Nene has the rest.

For a given number, if I have both cards, then I can play them in two of my turns, and I'll get a point on the second play.

If I have one card and Nene has the other, then whoever plays their card first will not get a point, and the second player to play that number will get a point.

If Nene has both cards, then she can play them in her turns to get a point.

So, for numbers where I have both cards, I can get one point.

For numbers where I have one card and Nene has the other, it's more complicated.

I need to think about the sequence of moves and who plays which card when.

Given that Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will play in a way that maximizes her points and, in case of ties in that, minimizes my points.

I need to find a way to model this.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in my hand.

Letâ€™s define:

- For each number, count how many cards I have.

So, in the first example:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, frequency:

1: 2

2: 1

3: 1

4: 0 (since Nene has both 4's)

Now, for numbers where I have both cards, I can get one point.

For numbers where I have one card and Nene has the other, it's more tricky.

Wait, in the first example, for number 1, I have both cards, so I can get one point by playing the second 1 after the first one is on the table.

For numbers 2 and 3, I have one card each, and Nene has the other.

So, for numbers 2 and 3, depending on the order of play, I might get a point or not.

In the example, it seems that I can get one point in total.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that I can get 1 point, and Nene gets 3.

Let me try to simulate the game.

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

Possible sequence:

1. I play 1, table: [1]

2. Nene plays 4, table: [1,4]

3. I play 1, table: [1,4,1], I get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table)

4. Nene plays 4, table: [1,4,1,4], Nene gets 1 point

5. I play 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2]

6. Nene plays 2, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2], Nene gets 1 point

7. I play 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3]

8. Nene plays 3, table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3,3], Nene gets 1 point

Total: I get 1 point, Nene gets 3 points.

Another possible sequence:

1. I play 2, table: [2]

2. Nene plays 4, table: [2,4]

3. I play 1, table: [2,4,1]

4. Nene plays 4, table: [2,4,1,4], Nene gets 1 point

5. I play 1, table: [2,4,1,4,1], I get 1 point

6. Nene plays 2, table: [2,4,1,4,1,2], Nene gets 1 point

7. I play 3, table: [2,4,1,4,1,2,3]

8. Nene plays 3, table: [2,4,1,4,1,2,3,3], Nene gets 1 point

Total: I get 1 point, Nene gets 3 points.

Seems like in both sequences, I get only 1 point.

Let me try another sequence:

1. I play 3, table: [3]

2. Nene plays 4, table: [3,4]

3. I play 1, table: [3,4,1]

4. Nene plays 4, table: [3,4,1,4], Nene gets 1 point

5. I play 1, table: [3,4,1,4,1], I get 1 point

6. Nene plays 2, table: [3,4,1,4,1,2], Nene gets 0 points (since 2 is not on the table yet)

7. I play 2, table: [3,4,1,4,1,2,2], I get 1 point

8. Nene plays 3, table: [3,4,1,4,1,2,2,3], Nene gets 1 point

Total: I get 2 points, Nene gets 2 points.

Wait, in this sequence, I got 2 points. But according to the explanation, it's only possible to get 1 point. What's different here?

Ah, I see. In step 7, I play 2, and since 2 is already on the table (played by Nene in step 6), I get 1 point.

But in the earlier sequences, I only got 1 point. So, is it possible to get 2 points?

Wait, maybe Nene can prevent me from getting 2 points by playing optimally.

Let me see Nene's options.

In step 6, Nene has cards 2 and 3. If she plays 2, then I can play 2 and get a point, as in the sequence above.

But if Nene plays 3 instead of 2 in step 6, then:

1. I play 3, table: [3]

2. Nene plays 4, table: [3,4]

3. I play 1, table: [3,4,1]

4. Nene plays 4, table: [3,4,1,4], Nene gets 1 point

5. I play 1, table: [3,4,1,4,1], I get 1 point

6. Nene plays 3, table: [3,4,1,4,1,3], Nene gets 1 point

7. I play 2, table: [3,4,1,4,1,3,2]

8. Nene plays 2, table: [3,4,1,4,1,3,2,2], Nene gets 1 point

Total: I get 1 point, Nene gets 3 points.

So, by playing 3 instead of 2 in step 6, Nene prevents me from getting the second point.

Therefore, Nene, being smart, would choose to play 3 in step 6 to minimize my score.

Hence, in the first sequence, I get only 1 point.

So, the maximum I can get is 1 point.

Okay, now I need a general strategy.

Let me think in terms of frequencies.

For each number, I have some cards, and Nene has the rest.

Possible cases:

1. I have both cards: I can get 1 point by playing the second one after the first one is on the table.

2. I have one card, Nene has one card.

In this case, the order of play matters.

If I play my card before Nene plays her card, I don't get a point, but Nene will play her card later and get a point.

If Nene plays her card before I play mine, then when I play mine, I get a point.

But Nene is smart and will choose to play her card earlier to prevent me from getting the point.

Wait, but in the turns, it's alternating between me and Nene.

So, the sequence of turns is fixed: me, Nene, me, Nene, and so on.

Given that, Nene can choose which card to play on her turn.

She will choose the card that maximizes her score and minimizes mine, in that order.

So, for numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, Nene can choose to play her card early to prevent me from getting a point.

Wait, but in the earlier sequence, when Nene played 3 instead of 2, it prevented me from getting the second point.

So, Nene, being smart, will play in a way to maximize her points and minimize mine.

In the case where I have one card and Nene has one card, Nene will play her card early to prevent me from getting a point.

Wait, but in the earlier sequence, if Nene plays 2 in step 6, then I can play 2 and get a point in step 7.

But if Nene plays 3 in step 6, then I don't get that point.

So, Nene, to minimize my score, will choose to play the card that prevents me from getting a point.

Hence, in such cases, I can't get a point.

Therefore, for numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, I can't get a point.

Only for numbers where I have both cards can I get a point.

Wait, but in the earlier sequence where Nene played 2 in step 6, I could get a point in step 7.

But Nene, being smart, chose to play 3 instead to prevent that.

Hence, in such cases, I can't rely on getting that point.

Therefore, perhaps the general rule is that I can get a point only for numbers where I have both cards.

For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, Nene can prevent me from getting a point by playing her card in a way that denies me the point.

Hence, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Wait, but in the first test case, for number 1, I have both cards, so I can get one point.

And indeed, in the example, I get 1 point.

In the second test case:

n = 8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Frequency:

7:1

4:1

1:1

2:1

8:2

5:2

So, for numbers 8 and 5, I have both cards, so I can get 2 points.

And indeed, the output is 2.

In the third test case:

n = 8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Frequency:

7:1

1:1

4:2

5:1

3:1

2:1

6:1

So, for number 4, I have both cards, so I can get 1 point.

And indeed, the output is 1.

In the fourth test case:

n = 3

My cards: 1,2,3

Frequency:

1:1

2:1

3:1

No number where I have both cards, so I can't get any points.

Output is 0.

In the fifth test case:

n = 1

My cards: 1

Frequency:

1:1

Nene has the other 1.

So, I can't get any points.

Output is 0.

Hence, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Looking back at the first test case, for number 1, I have both cards, so I can get 1 point.

For numbers 2 and 3, I have one card each, and Nene has the other, so Nene can prevent me from getting points for those.

Hence, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Wait, but in the second test case, for numbers 8 and 5, I have both cards, so I can get 2 points.

And indeed, the output is 2.

Similarly, in the third test case, only number 4 has both cards with me, so I can get 1 point.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, I don't have any numbers with both cards, so I get 0 points.

Hence, the strategy seems to be that I can get a point for each number where I have both cards.

For numbers where I have only one card, Nene can prevent me from getting a point by playing her card in a way that denies me the point.

Hence, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Wait, but in the second test case, for numbers 8 and 5, I have both cards, so I can get 2 points.

But looking at the frequency, for number 8, I have two 8's, and for number 5, I have two 5's.

Wait, no, in the second test case:

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, frequency:

7:1

4:1

1:1

2:1

8:2

5:2

Hence, numbers 8 and 5 have two cards with me.

So, I can get one point for each of them.

Hence, total points: 2.

Similarly, in the third test case:

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Frequency:

7:1

1:1

4:2

5:1

3:1

2:1

6:1

Hence, only number 4 has two cards with me, so I can get 1 point.

Hence, the general rule seems to be that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly on 2 cards.

Hence, for each number, there are two cards.

In my hand, for each number, I can have 0, 1, or 2 cards.

If I have both cards, I can get one point.

If I have one card, and Nene has the other, then Nene can prevent me from getting a point by playing her card in a way that denies me the point.

Hence, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Hence, the solution is to count the number of numbers where I have both cards.

In the code provided, it seems to be doing that.

Let me look at the code:

def func():

import sys

def func():

input = sys.stdin.readline

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

cnt = [0] * (n + 1)

for x in a:

cnt[x] += 1

ans = 0

for x in cnt:

ans += max(0, x - 1)

print(ans)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the list of cards in my hand.

Then, it counts the frequency of each number in my hand.

Then, for each number, it adds max(0, x - 1) to the answer.

Wait, x is the frequency in my hand.

So, if x = 2, then x - 1 = 1, so ans +=1

If x = 1, then x - 1 = 0, so ans +=0

If x = 0, then x -1 = -1, but max(0, -1) = 0, so ans +=0

Hence, it's counting the number of numbers where I have two cards.

Hence, the answer is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Which aligns with my earlier conclusion.

Hence, the code seems correct.

But wait, in the second test case, for numbers 8 and 5, I have two cards each, so ans = 2, which matches the output.

In the third test case, only number 4 has two cards with me, so ans =1.

In the first test case, only number 1 has two cards with me, so ans =1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, no number has two cards with me, so ans =0.

Hence, the code seems to be correct.

Hence, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
