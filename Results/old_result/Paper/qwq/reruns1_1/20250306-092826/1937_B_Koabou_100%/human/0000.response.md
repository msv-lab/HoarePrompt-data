Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump right or down to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). For each path it takes, we can form a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's basically the smallest string when compared character by character in dictionary order. So, for binary strings, '0' comes before '1'. That means, in trying to find the smallest string, I should prefer paths that have '0's as early as possible in the string.

Now, the grid is only 2 rows high but N columns wide, which means the paths are relatively straightforward. From (1,1), the grasshopper can move right to (1,2), then right again to (1,3), and so on, or at any point, it can move down to the second row and continue moving right there. So, each path corresponds to choosing at which column to switch from the first row to the second row.

Wait a minute, since the grasshopper can only move right or down, and the grid is only two rows, every path from (1,1) to (2,N) involves moving right N-1 times and down once, and the down move can happen at any step from the first to the Nth step.

So, in terms of the path, it's equivalent to choosing after how many right moves to make the down move. For example, if N=3, the possible paths are:

1. Right, Right, Down: stays in the first row until the end, then moves down.

2. Right, Down, Right: moves down after the first right move.

3. Down, Right, Right: moves down immediately, then moves right twice in the second row.

Each of these paths will give a different sequence of cells, and thus different binary strings.

My goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string among these possible paths and count how many paths lead to that string.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to generate the binary strings for all possible paths and compare them lexicographically to find the smallest one.

But since N can be up to 2*10^5 and T (number of test cases) up to 10^4, with the total sum of N over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to do this.

Generating all possible paths for each test case would be too slow because for each test case, there are N possible paths, and with N up to 2*10^5 and T up to 10^4, that's potentially up to 2*10^9 operations, which is way too slow.

So, I need a smarter way to find the smallest string without generating all paths.

Let me think about how the strings are formed.

Each path corresponds to choosing a position K (from 0 to N) where the grasshopper moves down after K right moves in the first row, and then continues with N-K right moves in the second row.

So, the string for a given K is a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1K} a_{2(K+1)} a_{2(K+2)} ... a_{2N}.

I need to find the K that gives the lexicographically smallest string among all possible K.

To find the smallest string, I need to compare these strings position by position.

One way to approach this is to iterate through the positions from left to right and determine at each position which path gives the smallest character.

Start with K=0, which means moving down immediately to the second row and moving right N times there, giving the string a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2N}.

Then K=1: move right once in the first row, then down, and then right N-1 times in the second row: a_{11} a_{22} a_{23} ... a_{2N}.

And so on, up to K=N: move right N times in the first row, then down (which is past the last column), but since we're ending at (2,N), it's a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1N} a_{2N}.

Wait, actually, when K=N, the path is right, right, ..., right (N times) in the first row, then down to (2,N). So the string is a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1N} a_{2N}.

Wait, but in the problem, the grasshopper can only move down once, and it must end at (2,N). So, for K from 0 to N, the path is:

- Down at the start (K=0): a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2N}

- Down after first right move (K=1): a_{11} a_{22} a_{23} ... a_{2N}

- ...

- Down after K right moves in the first row: a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1K} a_{2(K+1)} a_{2(K+1 +1)} ... a_{2N}

- Down after N right moves: a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1N} a_{2N}

So, for each K from 0 to N, we have a string s_K = a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1K} a_{2(K+1)} a_{2(K+1 +1)} ... a_{2N}, with the understanding that for K=0, a_{11} to a_{10} is empty, so it's just a_{21} to a_{2N}.

Now, to find the lexicographically smallest s_K among all K, and count how many K give this smallest s_K.

A naive approach would be to generate all s_K and find the minimum, but that's O(N^2) time, which is too slow for the constraints.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that all s_K have length N+1 (since the path includes N right moves and 1 down move, totaling N+1 cells).

I need to find the smallest string among s_K for K=0 to N.

To find the smallest string, I can iterate through the positions from left to right and see where the differences occur.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where the paths start to differ and determine based on that.

But that seems vague. Let's think differently.

Let me consider that the strings s_K are overlapping in parts.

For example, s_0 = a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2N}

s_1 = a_{11} a_{22} ... a_{2N}

s_2 = a_{11} a_{12} a_{23} ... a_{2N}

...

s_N = a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1N} a_{2N}

I need to find the smallest among these strings.

One way to approach this is to iterate through the positions and see at each position which K gives the smallest character.

Start with position 1:

- For s_0: a_{21}

- For s_1: a_{11}

- For s_2: a_{11}

- ...

- For s_N: a_{11}

So, the smallest a_{11} and a_{21}. If a_{11} < a_{21}, then for K >=1, s_K starts with a_{11}, which is smaller than s_0 starting with a_{21}. So, if a_{11} < a_{21}, then the smallest strings are among s_K for K >=1.

If a_{11} > a_{21}, then s_0 starts with a_{21}, which is smaller, so s_0 is the smallest.

If a_{11} == a_{21}, then need to look at the next position where they differ.

Wait, this seems similar to comparing strings lexicographically.

Maybe I can find the earliest position where the strings differ and determine based on that.

But this still seems too vague for an efficient algorithm.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix K and look at s_K.

I can see that s_K is composed of the first K characters from the first row and the last N-K characters from the second row, starting from position K+1 in the second row.

Wait, but in s_K, it's a_{11} to a_{1K}, then a_{2(K+1)} to a_{2N}.

So, the first K characters are from the first row, and the remaining N-K characters are from the second row, starting from position K+1.

So, s_K = a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1K} a_{2(K+1)} a_{2(K+2)} ... a_{2N}

Now, to find the smallest s_K, I need to choose K such that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest.

One way to approach this is to find the minimal possible starting character at each position, considering the overlap between the first and second rows.

Wait, perhaps I can merge the two rows in a way that minimizes the string.

Let me consider constructing the smallest possible string by choosing, at each step, the smallest available character from the possible choices.

Start with position 1:

- Choose the smallest possible character between a_{11} and a_{21}.

- If a_{11} < a_{21}, then choose a_{11}, which means we should choose K >=1.

- If a_{21} < a_{11}, then choose a_{21}, which means choose K=0.

- If a_{11} == a_{21}, need to look further.

Suppose we choose a_{11}, then for position 2, we have:

- If K >=1, then s_K[position 2] = a_{12}

- If K >=2, then s_K[position 2] = a_{12}

- If K ==0, then s_K[position 2] = a_{22}

So, if a_{12} < a_{22}, then choose K >=1.

If a_{22} < a_{12}, then choose K=0.

If equal, look further.

Wait, but if we choose K >=1, that means s_K[position 1] = a_{11}, and position 2 can be a_{12} if K >=2, or a_{22} if K ==1.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Maybe I need to think in terms of suffixes.

Let me consider that for each K, the string s_K is prefix of first row up to K, followed by suffix of second row starting from K+1.

So, s_K = a_{11}...a_{1K} + a_{2(K+1)}...a_{2N}

I need to find the minimal s_K among all K.

An efficient way to find the minimal s_K is to find the minimal possible combination of prefixes and suffixes.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate K from 0 to N and keep track of the minimal s_K seen so far.

But that would be O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the strings s_K overlap in their prefixes and suffixes.

Maybe I can use the fact that the strings are similar and find a way to compare them efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the string that is the smallest among a_{21}...a_{2N}, a_{11} + a_{22}...a_{2N}, a_{11}a_{12} + a_{23}...a_{2N}, and so on, up to a_{11}...a_{1N}a_{2N}.

This still seems too slow.

Let me think about the differences between consecutive s_K.

From s_K to s_{K+1}:

- s_K = a_{11}...a_{1K} a_{2(K+1)}...a_{2N}

- s_{K+1} = a_{11}...a_{1(K+1)} a_{2(K+2)}...a_{2N}

So, s_{K+1} is obtained by appending a_{1(K+1)} and removing a_{2(K+1)} from s_K.

This overlapping structure suggests that we might be able to use some kind of sliding window approach.

Wait, but the strings are not exactly sliding windows because the suffix shifts when K increases.

This is tricky.

Maybe I can consider the string S = a_{21}...a_{2N}, and then for each K from 1 to N, replace the K-th character of S with a_{1K}.

Wait, let's see:

- S = a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2N}

- For K=0: s_0 = S

- For K=1: s_1 = a_{11} a_{22} ... a_{2N} (which is S with a_{21} replaced by a_{11})

- For K=2: s_2 = a_{11} a_{12} a_{23} ... a_{2N} (which is S with a_{21} and a_{22} replaced by a_{11} and a_{12})

- ...

- For K=N: s_N = a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1N} a_{2N} (which is S with a_{21} to a_{2(N-1)} replaced by a_{11} to a_{1(N-1)}, and a_{2N} remains)

So, in general, s_K = a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1K} a_{2(K+1)} ... a_{2N}

Which is S with a_{21} to a_{2K} replaced by a_{11} to a_{1K}

So, to find the minimal s_K, I need to find the minimal string among S, S with a_{21} replaced by a_{11}, S with a_{21} and a_{22} replaced by a_{11} and a_{12}, and so on.

This still seems complicated.

Maybe I can iterate through K from 0 to N and keep track of the minimal s_K.

But again, that's O(N^2).

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the strings s_K for different K may share common prefixes.

Perhaps I can find the point where the strings start differing and focus on that.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the positions and determine the minimal possible character at each position, considering the choices from different K.

This sounds promising.

Let's try to formalize it.

Initialize an empty string min_s and a variable best_K.

Iterate through positions from 1 to N+1:

At each position, find the minimal character possible among all s_K at this position.

If multiple K give this minimal character, keep track of which K are still candidates.

At the end, the minimal s_K is the string formed by these minimal characters, and the number of paths is the number of K that achieve this.

But I need to make sure that the K that are candidates at each step are consistent with the previous choices.

This sounds like maintaining a range of possible K that are still candidates.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the minimal s_K by finding the K that minimizes the string.

Let me consider that the minimal s_K is the one where K is chosen as small as possible such that a_{11} to a_{1K} are as small as possible compared to a_{21} to a_{2K}.

Wait, perhaps I can find the smallest K where a_{11} to a_{1K} are smaller than or equal to a_{21} to a_{2K}.

This is still a bit vague.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first test case:

N=2

a1 = 00

a2 = 00

So, s_0 = 0 0

s_1 = 0 0

s_2 = 0 0

All strings are the same: 000

Wait, but according to the sample input, it's 000 with 2 paths.

Wait, but for N=2, K can be 0,1,2.

s_0 = a21 a22 a23? Wait, N=2, so a21 a22, but the output is 000.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump one cell right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N)."

So, in the first test case, N=2, a1=00, a2=00.

So, the grid is:

Row 1: 0 0

Row 2: 0 0

Paths:

1. Right, Right, Down: cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) -> string 0 0 0

2. Right, Down, Right: cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) -> string 0 0 0

3. Down, Right, Right: cells (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) -> string 0 0 0

So, all paths give the same string 000, and there are 3 paths.

But in the sample output, it's 000 and 2.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the grasshopper cannot go right beyond column N in row 2.

Wait, the problem says "the bottom-right cell (2,N)", so the path must end at (2,N), and the string is the sequence of cells without changing their order.

In the first test case, N=2, so the grid is:

Row 1: a11 a12 = 0 0

Row 2: a21 a22 = 0 0

Possible paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2): string a11 a12 a22 = 0 0 0

2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2): string a11 a21 a22 = 0 0 0

So, two paths give the same string 000.

Hence, the output is 000 and 2.

Wait, but in my earlier consideration, I thought there were three possible paths, but perhaps the path (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) and (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) are the only distinct paths, and the path (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) is the same as the second one.

Wait, no, actually, in a 2x2 grid, there are only two distinct paths to reach (2,2):

1. Right -> Down: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)

2. Down -> Right: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)

So, indeed, there are two paths, both giving the string 000.

Hence, the minimal string is 000, and there are two paths that give this string.

Got it.

So, in general, for N=2, there are two paths:

1. K=1: right once in row 1, then down to row 2, then right to (2,2)

   s_1 = a11 a22 = 0 0

   But the full string is a11 a12 a22 = 0 0 0

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify how the string is formed.

The problem says: "the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order."

So, for N=2, n+1=3, so each path should have 3 cells.

For path right -> right -> down: cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) -> string a11 a12 a22

For path down -> right -> right: cells (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) -> string a11 a21 a22

In the first test case, both paths give 0 0 0.

Hence, the minimal string is 000, and there are two paths that give this string.

Ok, now I need to generalize this for any N and any binary strings in a1 and a2.

I need an efficient way to find the minimal s_K and count the number of K that give this minimal s_K.

Let me think about how to compare s_K for different K.

Let's consider s_K and s_{K+1}.

s_K = a11 a12 ... a1K a2(K+1) ... a2N

s_{K+1} = a11 a12 ... a1K a1(K+1) a2(K+2) ... a2N

To compare s_K and s_{K+1}, I need to find the first position where they differ.

If they are equal, then s_K == s_{K+1}.

If they differ at some position, then the one with the smaller character at that position is lexicographically smaller.

I need to find the minimal among all these s_K.

An efficient way might be to iterate through K from 0 to N and keep track of the minimal s_K seen so far, but that's O(N^2).

I need a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through K from 0 to N and keep track of the point where s_K changes.

Let me consider that s_K differs from s_{K-1} at position K+1.

Wait, s_{K-1} = a11 ... a1(K-1) a2K ... a2N

s_K = a11 ... a1K a2(K+1) ... a2N

So, up to position K, s_K has a11 to a1K, and from position K+1, it has a2(K+1) to a2N.

Comparing s_{K-1} and s_K:

- Up to position K-1: both have a11 to a1(K-1)

- At position K: s_{K-1} has a2K, s_K has a1K

- From position K+1: s_{K-1} has a2(K+1) to a2N, s_K has a2(K+1) to a2N

So, the difference is at position K: s_{K-1} has a2K, s_K has a1K

Therefore, s_K < s_{K-1} if and only if a1K < a2K

Because at position K, a1K is compared to a2K, and the rest of the strings are the same.

Hence, the sequence of s_K as K increases is determined by whether a1K < a2K.

So, to find the minimal s_K, I can find the smallest possible a1K compared to a2K.

Wait, more precisely:

- If a1K < a2K, then s_K < s_{K-1}

- If a1K == a2K, then s_K == s_{K-1} up to position K, and the rest is the same.

- If a1K > a2K, then s_K > s_{K-1}

Therefore, the minimal s_K occurs when a1K < a2K for all K > some value, and a1K >= a2K for K <= that value.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal s_K by finding the smallest a1K compared to a2K.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal s_K by choosing the smallest possible a1K vs a2K at each step.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through K from 0 to N and keep track of the minimal s_K.

But I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal s_K is the one where a1K is as small as possible compared to a2K.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal s_K by choosing the smallest possible a1K < a2K.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal s_K by choosing the smallest K where a1K < a2K.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily correct.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through K from 0 to N and keep track of the minimal s_K.

But again, that's too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that s_K is the concatenation of a11 to a1K and a2(K+1) to a2N.

So, s_K = a11 a12 ... a1K a2(K+1) ... a2N

I need to find the minimal s_K among all K.

An efficient way to do this is to find the minimal possible a11 a12 ... a1K a2(K+1) ... a2N.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the positions and choose the smallest possible character at each position.

Wait, perhaps I can construct the minimal s_K by choosing, at each position, the smallest possible character across all s_K.

Wait, but in practice, that might be difficult.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that s_K is the string formed by taking the first K characters from a1 and then the remaining from a2 starting from K+1.

So, s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N]

Therefore, s_K is a concatenation of a substring from a1 and a substring from a2.

To find the minimal s_K, I can iterate through K and find the minimal concatenation.

But again, that's O(N^2).

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the minimal possible string by choosing the smallest character between a1 and a2 at each position, but considering that choosing a character from a1 at position i implies that for positions before i, I have to choose from a1, and after i, from a2.

Wait, that sounds complicated.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the point where I switch from a1 to a2.

That is, fix K, and s_K is a1[0:K] + a2[K:N]

To find the minimal s_K, I need to find the K that makes a1[0:K] + a2[K:N] lexicographically smallest.

An efficient way to find this is to find the minimal prefix of a1 combined with the suffix of a2.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the positions and keep track of the minimal possible s_K.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Initialize min_s as a2[0:N], and count as 1.

Then, iterate through K from 1 to N:

- Compute s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N]

- If s_K < min_s, set min_s = s_K and reset count to 1

- Else if s_K == min_s, increment count

But this is O(N^2) time, which is too slow.

I need a way to compute this in O(N) time.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compute the minimal s_K in linear time.

Let me consider that s_K is a1[0:K] + a2[K:N]

So, s_K is the concatenation of a1[0:K] and a2[K:N]

To find the minimal s_K, I need to find the minimal concatenation among all K.

An efficient way to do this is to iterate through K and find the point where a1[0:K] + a2[K:N] is minimal.

To optimize this, I can precompute the differences between a1 and a2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where switching from a1 to a2 gives the smallest possible string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through K and keep track of the current string built so far.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that s_K is a1[0:K] + a2[K:N], and compare s_K and s_{K+1}.

As I've thought earlier, s_K and s_{K+1} differ at position K.

Wait, more precisely, s_K and s_{K+1} differ at position K+1.

Wait, no.

Wait, s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N]

s_{K+1} = a1[0:K+1] + a2[K+1:N]

So, up to position K, s_K and s_{K+1} have a1[0:K], but at position K+1, s_K has a2[K], and s_{K+1} has a2[K+1].

Wait, no.

Wait, s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N]

s_{K+1} = a1[0:K+1] + a2[K+1:N]

So, up to position K, s_K has a1[0:K], and s_{K+1} has a1[0:K+1].

At position K+1, s_K has a2[K], and s_{K+1} has a2[K+1].

Wait, positions are 1-indexed, but let's think in 0-indexed.

Let me redefine:

s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N]

So, s_K has the first K characters from a1 and the remaining from a2 starting at K.

So, for K from 0 to N.

s_0 = a2[0:N]

s_1 = a1[0:1] + a2[1:N]

s_2 = a1[0:2] + a2[2:N]

...

s_N = a1[0:N] + a2[N:N] (which is just a1[0:N])

Wait, a2[N:N] is empty, so s_N = a1[0:N] + a2[N:N] = a1[0:N]

Wait, but according to the problem, the path must end at (2,N), so s_N should include a2[N], but in 0-indexing, a2[N] is out of bounds.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indexing.

Let me consider that s_K includes a1[0:K] and a2[K:N], and the total length is N+1.

Wait, but a1[0:K] has length K, and a2[K:N] has length N-K, so total length is K + (N - K) = N.

Wait, but according to the problem, the string should have length N+1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the last character.

Wait, in the first test case, N=2, s_K has length 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to include a2[N] in s_K.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N], but include a2[N] explicitly.

Wait, I need to be careful with the indexing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of positions.

Let me consider that s_K is composed of the first K characters from a1 and the last N-K+1 characters from a2 starting from position K.

Wait, but in the first test case, s_K for K=0 is a2[0] a2[1] a2[2], which is 0 0 0.

Wait, but a2 has only N=2 elements, so a2[0] and a2[1].

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the understanding.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N], but ensure that the total length is N+1.

Wait, in the first test case, N=2, s_K for K=0: a2[0] a2[1] a2[2], but a2 has only a2[0] and a2[1], so perhaps a2[N] is a2[N], which for N=2 is a2[2], but in the input, N=2, a2 has only two characters.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, a2 has N elements, indexed from 1 to N.

Wait, in the problem statement, a1 and a2 are both strings of length N.

Wait, in the first test case, N=2, a1=00, a2=00.

So, a1[1]=0, a1[2]=0

a2[1]=0, a2[2]=0

The path (1,1)-(1,2)-(2,2): cells a11, a12, a22 -> 0,0,0

Path (1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2): cells a11, a21, a22 -> 0,0,0

So, s_K for K=1: a11 a22 = 0 0

But the full string is a11 a12 a22 = 0 0 0

Wait, perhaps I need to include a2[N] in s_K.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N], but always include a2[N].

Wait, but a2[N] is out of bounds.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N], but ensure that a2[K:N] includes a2[N], which might be empty if K > N.

Wait, I need to clarify the indexing.

Let me consider that s_K is a1[0:K] + a2[K:N], where a1[0:K] has length K, and a2[K:N] has length N - K.

So, total length is K + (N - K) = N.

But according to the problem, the string should have length N+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to include a2[N], which is the last character.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N], but a2[N] is always included.

Wait, but in 0-indexing, a2[N] is out of bounds.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N], but a2[N] is included as the last character.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the path has N right moves and 1 down move, totaling N+1 cells.

So, s_K should have length N+1.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N], but include a2[N], which is the last cell.

Wait, but a2[N] is not defined for K >= N.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N], but for K=N, s_N = a1[0:N] + a2[N:N], which is a1[0:N], since a2[N:N] is empty.

But in the first test case, N=2, s_N = a1[0:2] + a2[2:2] = a1[0] a1[1] = 0 0, but the actual string should be 0 0 0.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the path always includes a2[N], regardless of K.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[0:K] + a2[K:N] + a2[N]

But a2[N] is not defined.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the path.

Each path consists of K right moves in the first row, followed by a down move to the second row, and then N - K right moves in the second row.

So, the cells are a1[0], a1[1], ..., a1[K-1], a2[K], a2[K+1], ..., a2[N-1]

Wait, in 0-indexing.

So, s_K = a1[0] a1[1] ... a1[K-1] a2[K] a2[K+1] ... a2[N-1]

And the length is K + (N - K) = N.

But the problem says the string has length N+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to include a2[N], but a2 has only up to index N-1 in 0-indexing.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the path includes N right moves and 1 down move, totaling N+1 cells.

Wait, in the first test case, N=2, s_K has length 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to include a2[N], which is a2[2], but in 0-indexing, a2[1].

Wait, I'm getting confused with indexing.

Let me try to clarify.

Assume 1-based indexing for the grid.

So, rows are 1 and 2, columns are 1 to N.

So, a1 is row 1, columns 1 to N.

a2 is row 2, columns 1 to N.

A path consists of moving right and down, starting at (1,1), ending at (2,N).

Each path corresponds to choosing when to move down.

If K is the number of right moves in row 1 before moving down, then:

- Cells in the path are:

- a1[1], a1[2], ..., a1[K], a2[K+1], a2[K+2], ..., a2[N]

- So, s_K = a1[1] a1[2] ... a1[K] a2[K+1] ... a2[N]

- Length is K + (N - K) = N.

But the problem says the string has length N+1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the down move cell.

Wait, when moving down from (1,K) to (2,K), and then right to (2,N).

So, the cells are a1[1], a1[2], ..., a1[K], a2[K], a2[K+1], ..., a2[N]

So, s_K = a1[1] a1[2] ... a1[K] a2[K] a2[K+1] ... a2[N]

Length is K + (N - K + 1) = N + 1.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, s_K = a1[1] a1[2] ... a1[K] a2[K] a2[K+1] ... a2[N]

Hence, in 0-based indexing, s_K = a1[0] a1[1] ... a1[K-1] a2[K] a2[K+1] ... a2[N-1]

Wait, but length should be N+1.

Wait, in 1-based indexing, s_K has K elements from a1[1] to a1[K], and N - K elements from a2[K+1] to a2[N], totaling N - K + K = N.

But according to the problem, the string has length N+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to include the down move cell.

Wait, perhaps s_K includes a2[K], not just a2[K+1] to a2[N].

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[1] to a1[K], a2[K], a2[K+1], ..., a2[N]

So, s_K = a1[1] a1[2] ... a1[K] a2[K] a2[K+1] ... a2[N]

Length is K + (N - K + 1) = N + 1.

Yes, that matches.

So, s_K = a1[1..K] + a2[K..N]

Similarly, s_0 = a2[1..N]

Wait, but for K=0, s_0 = a2[1..N], which has N elements, but the string should have N+1 elements.

Wait, perhaps for K=0, s_0 = a2[1..N], but need to include the down move from (1,0) which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust K.

Wait, maybe K ranges from 0 to N, where K is the number of right moves in row 1 before moving down.

So, for K=0: down immediately to (2,1), then right to (2,N): cells a2[1], a2[2], ..., a2[N]

So, s_0 = a2[1] a2[2] ... a2[N]

But that's only N elements, while the string should have N+1 elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to include the starting cell (1,1), which is a1[1], but for K=0, the path is down from (1,1) to (2,1), then right to (2,N), so cells a2[1], a2[2], ..., a2[N]

Hence, s_0 = a2[1] a2[2] ... a2[N]

But according to the problem, the string should have N+1 elements.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Looking back at the first test case:

N=2

a1=00

a2=00

Paths:

1. Right, Right, Down: a1[1], a1[2], a2[2] -> 0 0 0

2. Right, Down, Right: a1[1], a2[2], a2[3], but N=2, so a2[3] is out of bounds.

Wait, perhaps in the path, moving down to (2,K), then moving right to (2,N).

So, cells are a1[1..K], a2[K..N]

Hence, s_K = a1[1..K] + a2[K..N]

But in the first path, K=2: a1[1], a1[2], a2[3], but N=2, so a2[3] doesn't exist.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the understanding.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[1..K] + a2[K..N], which for K=N, is a1[1..N] + a2[N..N], which is a1[1..N]

Similarly, for K=0: a2[1..N]

Wait, but in the first test case, the output is 000, which is length 3 for N=2.

Wait, perhaps the path includes the down move cell.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[1..K] + a2[K..N], but include a2[K] twice: once from a1[K] to a2[K], and then from a2[K] to a2[N].

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order."

So, for N=2, n+1=3, so s_K should have 3 elements.

In the first test case, s_K = 000 for all paths.

Hence, s_K = a1[1], a1[2], a2[2]

Wait, but a2[2] is already included.

Wait, perhaps s_K = a1[1..K] + a2[K..N], but for K=N, it's a1[1..N] + a2[N..N], which is a1[1..N]

But in N=2, s_K = a1[1], a1[2], a2[3], which is out of bounds.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me
