Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper that starts at the top-left cell (1,1) and wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only jump one cell right or downwards. For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells of the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's the smallest string when compared character by character. So, for example, between "001" and "010", "001" is smaller because at the second position, 0 is smaller than 1.

Now, considering the grid, the grasshopper can move right or down. So, for a grid of size 2xN, the path will always consist of N right moves and N down moves, but since it's only 2 rows, the number of down moves will be 1, and the rest will be right moves. Wait, no. Actually, to go from (1,1) to (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any step.

Wait, no. Actually, the grasshopper can make multiple down moves if N is large, but given that there are only 2 rows, the down moves are limited. Wait, no. Wait, the grid is 2 rows by N columns, so from (1,1), it can move right to (1,2) or down to (2,1), and so on, until it reaches (2,N).

So, in general, the path can have any sequence of right and down moves, as long as it stays within the grid and reaches (2,N). The total number of moves will be (N-1) right moves and (N-1) down moves, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. To go from (1,1) to (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, because there are only 2 rows.

Wait, no. If N is the number of columns, starting from (1,1), to reach (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any step, including the last one.

Wait, actually, no. If it's a 2xN grid, to go from (1,1) to (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any position in the sequence, as long as it ends up at (2,N).

Wait, but in reality, the number of down moves required is 1, because there are only 2 rows. So, total moves are (N-1) right and 1 down, in any order, but constrained by the grid.

Wait, no. Actually, to go from (1,1) to (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any point in the path, as long as it doesn't go outside the grid.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the cells visited. Each path will visit N cells in row 1 and N cells in row 2, but since it's a path from (1,1) to (2,N), it's a path of length 2N-2, visiting cells in order.

Wait, no. Actually, in a grid with m rows and n columns, the number of moves to go from (1,1) to (m,n) is (m-1) down moves and (n-1) right moves, in some order.

So, in this case, m=2, n=N, so it's 1 down move and (N-1) right moves, in some order.

So, the total number of moves is N (since 1 down + (N-1) right = N moves), and the path length is N, as it visits N cells.

Wait, no. Wait, in grid movement, each move is either right or down, and the path from (1,1) to (2,N) would involve 1 down move and (N-1) right moves, totaling N moves, visiting N cells.

But in this problem, it's a bit different because it's a 2xN grid, and the path is from (1,1) to (2,N), with moves only right or down.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph where each cell is a node, and there are edges to the right and down neighbors.

So, from (1,1), it can go right to (1,2) or down to (2,1).

From (1,2), it can go right to (1,3) or down to (2,2).

From (2,1), it can go right to (2,2) or down isn't possible since it's the last row.

And so on, until it reaches (2,N).

So, the path consists of a sequence of cells from (1,1) to (2,N), moving only right or down.

Now, for each path, we can construct a string by concatenating the values in the cells in the order they are visited.

Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest such string and also count how many paths produce this string.

First, I need to think about how to find the smallest possible string.

One way is to try all possible paths, collect their strings, and find the smallest one, but that's not efficient, especially since N can be up to 2*10^5, and T is up to 10^4, with the sum of N over all test cases up to 2*10^5.

So, we need a smarter approach.

I need to find a way to determine the smallest possible string without enumerating all paths.

Let me think about how the string is built.

Each path starts at (1,1), ends at (2,N), and consists of moves right or down.

The string is the sequence of values in the cells visited in order.

To get the lexicographically smallest string, we need the smallest possible characters at the earliest positions.

So, we should try to choose paths that pick the smallest available values at each step.

But since the grid is only 2 rows, it might be manageable.

Let me consider the grid as two arrays: row 1 and row 2.

We need to go from the start of row 1 to the end of row 2.

At each step, we can choose to move right in the current row or, if possible, move down to the next row.

Wait, since there are only two rows, moving down from row 1 goes to row 2, and from row 2, moving down isn't possible.

So, the path can have at most one down move, because after moving down from row 1 to row 2, further down moves are not possible.

Wait, no, actually, if N is larger, and the grid has only two rows, but the grasshopper can move down multiple times if N is larger, but in this case, since it's only two rows, the down move can only be done once.

Wait, no, from row 1, you can move down to row 2, and then only move right in row 2.

So, effectively, the path can have only one down move, from some cell in row 1 to the corresponding cell in row 2, and then continue right in row 2.

So, in terms of the sequence, it's like choosing a position k where you switch from row 1 to row 2.

So, for each k from 1 to N, you can take the first k-1 cells from row 1, then move down to row 2 at position k, and then take the remaining N-k cells in row 2.

Thus, the path corresponds to choosing a position k where you switch from row 1 to row 2.

Hence, the string is s1[1 to k-1], s2[k to N].

So, to find the lexicographically smallest string, you need to choose k that makes s1[1 to k-1] + s2[k to N] smallest.

Wait, but actually, it's not exactly that, because when you move down, you also include the cell where you move down.

Wait, let's think carefully.

When you are at (1,j), you can either move right to (1,j+1) or down to (2,j).

If you move down to (2,j), then you have to continue moving right in row 2 until (2,N).

So, the path includes:

- All cells from (1,1) to (1,k-1), then (2,k) to (2,N).

Wait, but in this problem, when moving down, do you include the cell you move down to?

Wait, no, in path terms, when you move down from (1,j) to (2,j), you are visiting (2,j), and then you can only move right in row 2.

So, the string is s1[1], s1[2], ..., s1[k-1], s2[k], s2[k+1], ..., s2[N].

So, you are choosing k from 1 to N+1 (where k=1 means you move down at the start, k=N+1 means you move only right in row 1 and then down at the end).

Wait, actually, k can be from 1 to N+1.

- If k=1: move down at the start to (2,1), then right to (2,2), ..., (2,N). String is s2[1 to N].

- If k=2: move right in row 1 to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,3), ..., (2,N). String is s1[1], s2[2 to N].

- ...

- If k=N: move right in row 1 to (1,N), then down to (2,N). String is s1[1 to N-1], s2[N].

- If k=N+1: move right in row 1 to (1,N), then down to (2,N). Same as k=N.

Wait, actually, k=N+1 is the same as k=N.

So, k ranges from 1 to N.

Wait, but in the previous examples, k represents the column where you move down.

So, k=1: down at column 1, string is s2[1 to N].

k=2: right in row 1 to column 2, then down, string is s1[1], s2[2 to N].

...

k=N: right in row 1 to column N, then down, string is s1[1 to N-1], s2[N].

Wait, but in the grid, moving down from (1,j) to (2,j), then moving right in row 2 to (2,N).

So, the string is s1[1 to j-1], s2[j to N].

So, for each k from 1 to N, the string is s1[1 to k-1], s2[k to N].

Our task is to choose k that makes this string lexicographically smallest.

So, we need to find the k in 1 to N that minimizes the string s1[1 to k-1] + s2[k to N].

Once we have that string, we also need to count how many paths yield this string.

But in this setup, for each k, there is only one path that corresponds to that k, because you choose exactly where to move down.

Wait, no, actually, for each k, there is only one path that corresponds to moving down at column k.

So, the number of paths that yield the smallest string is equal to the number of k's that produce that same smallest string.

Wait, no.

Wait, for each k, the path is uniquely determined: right, right, ..., down, right, right, ... .

So, for each k, there is exactly one path that corresponds to it.

Hence, to find the number of paths that yield the smallest string, we need to find how many k's produce the same smallest string.

So, the approach is:

1. For each k from 1 to N, compute the string s = s1[1 to k-1] + s2[k to N].

2. Find the smallest such s.

3. Count how many k's produce this smallest s.

But this is O(N^2), which is too slow for N up to 2*10^5.

We need a smarter way.

Let me think about how to find the smallest possible s.

We need to choose k such that s1[1 to k-1] + s2[k to N] is lex smallest.

To find the lex smallest string among these options, we can consider the following:

- Compare the strings for different k's position by position.

- Find the position where they differ to determine which one is smaller.

But doing this directly is inefficient.

Perhaps we can find a way to find the best k by scanning the strings.

Let me consider that s1 and s2 are strings of length N.

We need to consider all possible splits: take prefix of s1 up to k-1, and suffix of s2 starting at k.

Our aim is to choose k such that the concatenation is lex smallest.

I recall that for two strings, to find the lex smallest concatenation, we can find the minimal rotation of the combined string.

Wait, but in this case, it's not exactly that.

Wait, perhaps we can think of it as finding the k where s1[1 to k-1] + s2[k to N] is smallest.

Let me consider that s1 and s2 are arrays of characters.

I need to find k such that the string formed by taking s1[0 to k-2] + s2[k-1 to N-1] is smallest.

(In 0-indexing.)

Wait, in the code provided, s1 and s2 are lists of characters, and n is the length.

Looking at the provided code:

def func_1():

global ans, count

ans = []

ans = s1 + list(s2[n - 1])

point = n - 1

for i in range(n):

if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i - 1] == '0' and (i - 1 >= 0):

ans = s1[0:i]

ans = ans + s2[i - 1:n]

point = i - 1

break

count = 1

for i in range(point, -1, -1):

if s1[i] != s2[i - 1]:

break

count = count + 1

Wait, this seems problematic.

First, it initializes ans as s1 + [s2[n-1]].

Then, it iterates through s1, and if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i-1] == '0', it sets ans to s1[0:i] + s2[i-1:n], and sets point = i - 1.

Then, it counts the number of positions from point down to 0 where s1[i] == s2[i-1].

This seems overly simplistic and may not cover all cases.

Let me think of a better way.

I need to find the k that minimizes s1[1 to k-1] + s2[k to N].

To do this efficiently, I can precompute the prefix of s1 and suffix of s2 for each k and find the lex smallest concatenation.

But doing this naively is O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal concatenation in linear time.

I recall that for comparing two strings, the lex smaller one is the one that has a smaller character at the first position where they differ.

So, to find the minimal concatenation, I need to find the k where the sequence starts with the smallest possible characters as early as possible.

One efficient way to do this is to find the minimal suffix among s1 and s2.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the strings s1 and s2 and find the smallest possible concatenation s1[1 to k-1] + s2[k to N].

To do this efficiently, I can compute the minimal possible starting character at each position.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal possible string by considering the minimal choices at each step.

Let me consider a dynamic programming approach.

Define dp[k] as the smallest string obtainable by choosing to switch at column k.

So, dp[k] = s1[1 to k-1] + s2[k to N].

Our aim is to find the minimal dp[k] over all k from 1 to N.

To compute this efficiently, I need a way to find the minimal concatenation.

I can precompute the prefix of s1 and the suffix of s2.

Let me precompute prefix_s1[i] = s1[1 to i], and suffix_s2[i] = s2[i to N].

Then, dp[k] = prefix_s1[k-1] + suffix_s2[k].

But this is still O(N^2) in time.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where s1 and s2 differ the least.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where s1 switches to s2 in the smallest possible way.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and find the first position where s1 has a '1' and s2 has a '0', and switch there.

Because switching before that would include '1' from s1, which is worse than '0' from s2.

So, find the leftmost position where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0', and switch there.

Then, for all positions before that, stay in s1, and switch at that position to s2.

Wait, but s2 might have '1's after that.

I need to make sure that switching at that position gives the smallest possible string.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose to switch at the first position where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0'.

If s1 has '0' and s2 has '0', it's better to stay in s1 as long as possible.

If s1 has '0' and s2 has '1', it's better to stay in s1.

If s1 has '1' and s2 has '0', switch to s2 at that position.

If s1 has '1' and s2 has '1', it's the same.

So, the optimal switch point is the first position where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0'.

Before that, stay in s1, after that, switch to s2.

Wait, but s2 might have '0's before that position.

Wait, no, if s1 has '0' and s2 has '0', it's indifferent.

If s1 has '0' and s2 has '1', stay in s1.

If s1 has '1' and s2 has '0', switch to s2.

If s1 has '1' and s2 has '1', it's the same.

So, the optimal switch point is the first position where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0'.

Before that, stay in s1, after that, switch to s2.

Wait, but s2 might have '0's before that position.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the position where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0', and switch there.

Then, for all positions before that, stay in s1, and after that, switch to s2.

But s2 might have '0's before that position, which could be better.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the position where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0', and switch there.

Then, for all positions before that, stay in s1, and after that, switch to s2.

But I need to make sure that s2 doesn't have '0's before that position.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal string by considering the differences.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal choice at each step.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the first test case:

n=2

s1=00

s2=00

So, possible k's:

k=1: s2[1 to 2] = 00

k=2: s1[1] + s2[2] = 00

k=3: s1[1 to 2] + s2[3 to 2] = 00 (since k=3 is out of bounds, it's just s1[1 to 2])

So, all k's give 00, which matches the sample output of 000, but wait, the sample output is 000, which is length 3, but n=2.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the sample input, n=2, s1=00, s2=00, output is 000, which seems incorrect.

Wait, no, in the sample input, n=2, s1=00, s2=00, output is 000, which is length 3.

Wait, but n=2 should have strings of length 3, because the path includes n moves: n-1 right and 1 down, totaling n cells visited.

Wait, no, in a 2x2 grid, from (1,1) to (2,2), the path can be:

- Right to (1,2), then down to (2,2): cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,2): string 000

- Down to (2,1), then right to (2,2): cells (1,1), (2,1), (2,2): string 000

So, both paths give 000, which matches the sample output.

Hence, for n=2, s1=00, s2=00, the smallest string is 000, and there are 2 paths that yield this string.

So, in this case, the smallest string is 000, and there are 2 paths.

In the second test case:

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

Possible k's:

k=1: s2[1 to 4] = 1100

k=2: s1[1] + s2[2 to 4] = 1 + 100 = 1100

k=3: s1[1 to 2] + s2[3 to 4] = 11 + 00 = 1100

k=4: s1[1 to 3] + s2[4] = 110 + 0 = 1100

k=5: s1[1 to 4] + s2[5 to 4] = 1101 (since k=5 is out of bounds for s2)

Wait, s2 has only 4 elements, so s2[5 to 4] is invalid, so it's just s1[1 to 4] = 1101

So, the possible strings are:

k=1: 1100

k=2: 1100

k=3: 1100

k=4: 1100

k=5: 1101

Hence, the smallest string is 1100, which is achieved by k=1,2,3,4.

But according to the sample output, it's 11000, with only 1 path.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, n=4, so the path length is 4 cells.

Wait, in the first test case with n=2, the path length was 3 cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) or (1,1), (2,1), (2,2).

Wait, no, in n=2, the path has 3 cells.

Similarly, in n=4, the path has 5 cells.

Wait, no, in general, for n columns and 2 rows, the path from (1,1) to (2,n) involves n right moves and 1 down move, totaling n+1 cells.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=2, the output is 000, which is length 3, which matches n+1.

In the second test case, n=4, the output is 11000, which is length 5, matching n+1.

Hence, the path length is always n+1, consisting of n moves: n-1 right and 1 down.

Wait, no, the path length is n+1 cells, as it's n moves: n-1 right and 1 down.

Each move goes from one cell to another, so the number of cells visited is n+1.

Hence, the string should be of length n+1.

In the first test case, n=2, string is 000, length 3.

In the second test case, n=4, string is 11000, length 5.

Hence, for each path, the string is of length n+1.

Now, in the second test case, n=4, s1=1101, s2=1100.

Possible paths:

1. Right, Right, Right, Down: cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4): string 11010

Wait, s1=1101, s2=1100.

Wait, (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=0, (1,4)=1, (2,4)=0.

So, string is 11010.

2. Right, Right, Down, Right: cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4): string 11000

3. Right, Down, Right, Right: cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4): string 11000

4. Down, Right, Right, Right: cells (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4): string 11000

Hence, the smallest string is 11000, achieved by paths 2,3,4.

But according to the sample output, it's 11000 with 1 path.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the sample output, it's 11000 with 1 path.

But according to my analysis, there are 3 paths that give 11000.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the path construction.

Wait, perhaps the path includes only n cells, not n+1.

Wait, no, in the first test case, n=2, path has 3 cells, which matches n+1.

In n=4, path has 5 cells.

Hence, path length is n+1 cells.

Hence, string length is n+1.

Now, in the second test case, n=4, s1=1101, s2=1100.

Possible paths and strings:

1. Right, Right, Right, Down: 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0: 11010

2. Right, Right, Down, Right: 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0: 11000

3. Right, Down, Right, Right: 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0: 11000

4. Down, Right, Right, Right: 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0: 11000

Hence, the smallest string is 11000, achieved by paths 2,3,4.

But the sample output says 11000 with 1 path.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the sample considers only one path yielding the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the sample output.

Wait, in the second test case, the output is:

11000

1

But according to my analysis, there are 3 paths yielding 11000.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the path includes only n cells, not n+1.

Wait, no, in the first test case, n=2, path has 3 cells, which is n+1.

Wait, perhaps the path includes n moves, visiting n+1 cells.

But in the sample, for n=2, path has 3 cells, for n=4, path has 5 cells.

Hence, path length is n+1 cells.

Hence, string length is n+1.

Now, in the second test case, n=4, s1=1101, s2=1100.

Possible strings:

- 11010

- 11000

- 11000

- 11000

Hence, smallest is 11000, achieved by 3 paths.

But sample output says 1 path.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the path is constructed.

Wait, perhaps the path includes only n cells, not n+1.

Wait, no, in the first test case, n=2, path has 3 cells.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the path includes n moves: n-1 right and 1 down, visiting n+1 cells.

Hence, the string is of length n+1.

But in the second test case, according to the sample output, there's only one path yielding the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the paths.

Wait, perhaps the path where you switch at k=1 gives 11000.

Wait, no, switching at k=1: s2[1 to 4] = 1100.

But the path would be Down, Right, Right, Right: cells (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4): string 11000.

Similarly, switching at k=2: Right, Down, Right, Right: cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4): string 11000.

Switching at k=3: Right, Right, Down, Right: cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4): string 11000.

Switching at k=4: Right, Right, Right, Down: cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4): string 11010.

Switching at k=5: Right, Right, Right, Down: same as k=4.

Hence, paths for k=1,2,3 give 11000; k=4,5 give 11010.

Hence, the smallest string is 11000, achieved by 3 paths.

But the sample output says 1 path
