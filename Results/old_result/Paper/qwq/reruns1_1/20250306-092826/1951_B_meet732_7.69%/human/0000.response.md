Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position, and they're going to have a tournament where they fight in a specific sequence. The fights are between the current winner and the next cow in line. The one with the higher rating wins and proceeds to the next fight.

My goal is to maximize the number of wins for a specific cow, k, by possibly swapping its position with another cow, or choosing to do nothing. I need to find out the maximum number of wins k can achieve with at most one swap.

First, I need to understand how the tournament works. The first fight is between cow 1 and cow 2. The winner of that fights cow 3, and so on, until there's a final winner.

So, for cow k to participate in many fights, it needs to win as many consecutive fights as possible. Each win allows it to fight again against the next cow in line.

But here's the thing: cow k's path to winning multiple fights depends on the cows it faces. Since the higher-rated cow always wins, cow k needs to have a higher rating than the cows it fights to win those fights.

Wait, but I can swap cow k with another cow once. So, maybe by swapping positions, I can put cow k in a position where it can win more fights.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, if I don't swap cow k, it stays in its original position and fights according to the sequence. I need to calculate how many wins it would achieve in this case.

Then, considering swapping cow k with another cow, say cow j, I need to see if this swap allows cow k to win more fights.

But swapping cow k with cow j means that cow k is now in position j, and cow j is in position k. So, the sequence of fights would be different.

I need to find the best position for cow k to be placed to maximize its wins.

But iterating over all possible positions to swap cow k with would be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 10^5 per test case, and t can be up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^5.

So, I need a smarter way to find the optimal position for cow k to be swapped to, without checking every possible position.

Let me think about the tournament structure. It's like a single-elimination tournament where each fight is between the current champion and the next challenger.

In the initial setup, the first fight is between cow 1 and cow 2. The winner fights cow 3, and so on, until all cows have fought.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve depends on how many cows it can defeat in a row, starting from its initial position.

But if I swap cow k with another cow, I change its starting position in the sequence of fights.

I need to find a position where, starting from there, cow k can defeat as many subsequent cows as possible.

But there's a catch: the sequence of fights is not arbitrary; it's determined by the initial positions and the wins.

Wait, maybe I need to model this as a tournament tree.

But with n up to 10^5 per test case, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider that cow k can only participate in the fights if it wins against the previous winner.

So, if I place cow k in a certain position, I need to ensure that it can reach that position in the sequence of fights.

Wait, but in the tournament, the sequence is fixed: the first fight is between cow 1 and cow 2, then the winner fights cow 3, and so on.

So, the sequence is deterministic based on the positions.

If I swap cow k with cow j, then the sequence changes because now cow k is in position j, and cow j is in position k.

But this seems complicated to handle directly.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that cow k can win against any cow with a lower rating.

So, in the sequence of fights, cow k can keep winning as long as the cows it faces have lower ratings.

The number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are after it in the sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

But because of the tournament structure, it's not just about the cows after it; it's about the sequence of fights.

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the tournament and see how far cow k can go.

But simulating the entire tournament for each test case would be too slow because n can be up to 10^5 per test case.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the tournament can be represented as a sequence of fights, where the current champion fights the next cow in line.

So, starting from position 1 and 2, the winner fights position 3, and so on.

If I swap cow k with cow j, then cow k is now in position j, and the sequence starts from position 1 again.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think about the positions in terms of the order of fights.

Wait, perhaps I can model the tournament as a linked list, where each fight is a step.

But that might not lead me to an efficient solution.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix cow k in a certain position, and I want to see how many wins it can achieve from there.

I need to see how many cows with lower ratings are after it in the sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

But again, because of the tournament structure, it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of cows with lower ratings that are after cow k in the sequence, and before encountering a cow with higher rating.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look at the example to get some intuition.

Take the first example:

n = 6, k = 1 (0-indexed, so position 0)

a = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

If we don't swap, the sequence of fights is:

- Fight 1: 12 vs 10, 12 wins

- Fight 2: 12 vs 14, 14 wins

So, cow k (12) wins only once.

In the explanation, it says that doing nothing is optimal, resulting in 1 win.

In the second test case:

n = 6, k = 5 (0-indexed, position 4)

a = [7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]

If we swap k (727) with position 2 (12), then:

a' = [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]

Sequence of fights:

- Fight 1: 7 vs 2, 7 wins

- Fight 2: 7 vs 727, 727 wins

- Fight 3: 727 vs 10, 727 wins

- Fight 4: 727 vs 12, 727 wins

- Fight 5: 727 vs 13, 727 wins

Wait, but in the explanation, they swapped k to position 3 (index 2), and got 2 wins.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, in the second test case, k is 5 (index 4, 727), and they swapped it to position 3 (index 2).

Wait, no, in the explanation, they swapped k to position 3 (index 2), making a' = [7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]

Then:

- Fight 1: 7 vs 2, 7 wins

- Fight 2: 7 vs 12, 12 wins

- Fight 3: 12 vs 10, 12 wins

- Fight 4: 12 vs 727, 727 wins

- Fight 5: 727 vs 13, 727 wins

So, cow k (727) wins 2 fights: against 12 and 13.

Wait, but in the explanation, they got 2 wins, which matches this.

But in my earlier mistake, I thought swapping to position 2, but actually in the explanation, they swapped to position 3 (index 2).

Wait, no, in the explanation, they swapped to position 3 (index 2), but in my earlier calculation, I set a' = [7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13], which is swapping k to position 3 (index 2).

But according to the explanation, they set a' = [7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13], which is swapping k to position 3 (index 2).

Then, the sequence is:

- Fight 1: 7 vs 2, 7 wins

- Fight 2: 7 vs 12, 12 wins

- Fight 3: 12 vs 10, 12 wins

- Fight 4: 12 vs 727, 727 wins

- Fight 5: 727 vs 13, 727 wins

So, cow k (727) wins twice.

But in my earlier mistake, I thought swapping to position 2, but in reality, swapping to position 3 (index 2).

Wait, I think I need to be careful with indices.

Moving on.

I need to find a general approach.

Let me consider that cow k can win against all cows with lower ratings, but in the tournament sequence, it might face higher-rated cows at certain points.

I need to place cow k in a position where it can avoid facing higher-rated cows as much as possible, so it can win more fights.

But since the tournament proceeds by always having the current champion fight the next cow in line, the sequence is deterministic based on the positions.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the "champion path" that cow k can take.

If I place cow k in a certain position, I need to see how many cows it can defeat in a row.

But I need to consider that the champion progresses through the sequence, defeating cows one by one.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximum number of consecutive cows after a certain position that have lower ratings than cow k.

But I need to consider that cow k needs to be placed in a position where it can reach that sequence of lower-rated cows.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I don't swap cow k. Then, I can calculate how many wins it would achieve in the default sequence.

Then, consider swapping cow k with another cow, and calculate the wins in the new sequence.

I need to find the maximum among these possibilities.

But again, iterating over all possible swaps is too slow for the constraints.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the tournament can be modeled as a series of fights where the champion progresses by defeating the next cow in line.

So, if cow k is placed in a certain position, I need to see how many cows with lower ratings are after it in the sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position, how many wins cow k would achieve if it were placed there.

But precomputing for each position would still be O(n), which is too slow for the constraints.

Wait, but the sum of n over all test cases is 1e5, so if I can handle each test case in O(n), that would be acceptable.

But I need to see if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to compute the maximum wins in O(1) or O(log n) per test case.

But that seems optimistic.

Let me try to think about the problem more carefully.

First, if I don't swap cow k, I can calculate how many wins it achieves in the default sequence.

Then, by swapping cow k with another cow, I change its position, and thus the sequence of fights.

I need to choose the best position to swap cow k to, to maximize its wins.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about where to place cow k such that it faces the weakest possible cows in sequence.

But again, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider the tournament structure more carefully.

The tournament proceeds as follows:

- Fight 1: position 1 vs position 2, winner proceeds to fight position 3, and so on.

So, the champion progresses by fighting the next cow in line.

Therefore, if cow k is placed in position i, it will fight against the cows in positions i+1, i+2, etc., as long as it keeps winning.

But wait, not exactly. Because the champion is the one who wins each fight, and proceeds to the next fight.

So, if I place cow k in position i, it will only get a chance to fight if it is the champion up to that point.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that cow k can only start fighting from its own position onwards.

But that seems unclear.

Let me try to think recursively.

If cow k is placed in position i, then:

- If i > 1, the champion up to position i-1 must have defeated all previous cows.

- For cow k to get a chance to fight, it must be that the champion up to position i-1 is cow k itself.

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to consider that cow k can only start fighting from its own position, and win against the subsequent cows until it loses.

But in the tournament structure, the champion is the one who keeps winning, so cow k needs to be the champion up to its position to be able to fight further.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me try to look for a different approach.

Suppose I fix cow k in position i, and I want to know how many wins it can achieve.

For cow k to win a fight, it needs to have a higher rating than the cow it is fighting.

In the tournament, cow k can only fight if it is the champion up to its position.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the maximum number of consecutive wins starting from position i.

But I need to relate it to cow k's rating.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of the rating of cow k and the ratings of other cows.

Since all ratings are unique, I can order the cows by their ratings.

Let me sort the cows in descending order of their ratings.

The highest-rated cow will win all fights until it faces a higher-rated cow, but since all ratings are unique, it will keep winning until the end.

Wait, but the highest-rated cow will always win any fight it participates in, since all ratings are unique.

Wait, no, it will win against any cow with a lower rating, which is all other cows.

So, the highest-rated cow will always win the entire tournament, regardless of positions.

But in our problem, we have cow k, which may not have the highest rating.

We need to maximize the number of wins cow k achieves.

So, if cow k has the highest rating, it will win all fights until it faces a cow with a higher rating, but since it has the highest rating, it will win all fights.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that in each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match.

So, if cow k has the highest rating, it will win all its fights until the end.

But in reality, there is only one cow with the highest rating, so if cow k has the highest rating, it will win all its fights.

But if it doesn't have the highest rating, it will eventually lose to a cow with a higher rating.

So, in the default sequence, without any swap, cow k can win all fights until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Similarly, if I swap cow k with another cow, I change its position, and thus the sequence of fights it participates in.

My goal is to choose a position for cow k such that it faces as few higher-rated cows as possible before facing a cow it can't defeat.

Wait, but it's more precise to say that I want cow k to face cows with lower ratings for as long as possible.

But since the tournament proceeds by the champion facing the next cow in line, I need to place cow k in a position where the cows before it either have lower ratings or are defeated by other cows with lower ratings.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are after it in the sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I place cow k in position i, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings in positions i+1 to n, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

But I need to make sure that cow k can reach position i in the first place, which depends on the sequence of fights before position i.

This seems too involved.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix cow k in position i, then the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings in positions i+1 to n, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

But I need to consider that cow k needs to win against the current champion up to position i-1.

Wait, this is getting too tangled.

I need a better plan.

Let me consider that the tournament can be represented as a linked list, where each node is a cow, and the champion progresses along the list, fighting the next cow.

Then, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings in its subtree.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the position of cow k and the positions of cows with higher ratings.

If I can place cow k before all cows with higher ratings, it can win against all cows until it reaches a higher-rated cow.

So, the maximum number of wins is equal to the number of cows between its position and the nearest higher-rated cow before or after it.

Wait, that might be a way to think about it.

So, if I place cow k in a position where there are no higher-rated cows before it, it can win against all cows until it reaches a higher-rated cow.

So, the maximum number of wins is equal to the number of cows between its position and the nearest higher-rated cow.

So, perhaps I can compute for each possible position, the number of cows with lower ratings between that position and the nearest higher-rated cow.

Then, choose the position where this number is maximized.

But again, iterating over all possible positions is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the positions where cow k can be placed such that it is before any higher-rated cow in the sequence.

Then, the number of wins would be equal to the number of cows with lower ratings between its new position and the nearest higher-rated cow.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that if I place cow k in position i, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings between position i and the nearest position j where a_j > a_k, either before or after position i.

So, for each position i, I need to find the number of cows with lower ratings between i and the nearest higher-rated cow.

Then, choose the position i that maximizes this number.

This seems similar to finding the window between two higher-rated cows and maximizing the number of lower-rated cows within that window.

But I need to make sure that cow k is placed in a position where it can reach that window in the tournament sequence.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I don't swap cow k. Then, in the default sequence, cow k will get a chance to fight if it is the champion up to its position.

But in the default sequence, the champion is determined by the fights before cow k.

So, if cow k is in position p, then the champion reaching position p must have defeated all cows before p.

So, for cow k to get a chance to fight, the champion up to position p-1 must be cow k itself or a cow with a higher rating than cow k.

But if the champion up to position p-1 has a higher rating than cow k, then cow k will lose immediately.

So, cow k can only get a chance to fight if it is the champion up to its own position.

Wait, this seems recursive.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define that cow k can start fighting from position i if it is the champion up to position i-1.

But this seems too involved.

Maybe I need to consider that cow k can only start fighting from its own position, and win against the subsequent cows until it loses.

But in the tournament structure, the champion is the one who keeps winning and proceeds to the next fight.

So, if I place cow k in position i, it will only get a chance to fight if it is the champion up to position i-1.

This seems too circular.

Perhaps I need to consider that the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve is determined by the number of cows with lower ratings that are after it in the sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I place cow k in a position where there are many cows with lower ratings after it, and the nearest higher-rated cow is far away, then cow k can win more fights.

So, perhaps I can precompute for each position, the number of cows with lower ratings between that position and the nearest higher-rated cow.

Then, choose the position with the maximum such number.

But again, iterating over all positions is too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the optimal position for cow k is either its original position or a position between two higher-rated cows.

Wait, perhaps I can find the interval between two higher-rated cows where cow k can be placed to maximize its wins.

So, find the window between two higher-rated cows where there are the most lower-rated cows, and place cow k there.

But I need to make sure that cow k can reach that position in the tournament sequence.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix cow k in position i, then the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings between position i and the nearest higher-rated cow after position i.

So, for each possible position i, compute the number of lower-rated cows between i and the next higher-rated cow.

Then, choose the position i that maximizes this number.

If I can compute this efficiently, it would be acceptable.

To compute this efficiently, I can precompute for each position, the distance to the next higher-rated cow, and count the number of lower-rated cows in between.

This can be done using a stack or some precomputing technique.

But I need to make sure that this can be done efficiently within the time constraints.

Given that the sum of n over all test cases is 1e5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

So, perhaps using a stack to keep track of the next higher-rated cow for each position.

Yes, that's a standard technique in algorithm problems.

So, I can precompute for each position, the index of the next higher-rated cow to the right.

Then, for each possible position to place cow k, the number of wins is equal to the number of lower-rated cows between its position and the next higher-rated cow.

Then, I can choose the position where this number is maximized.

But I need to make sure that cow k can be placed in that position.

Wait, but in the problem, I can only swap cow k with one other cow, or choose not to swap.

So, I need to consider only the positions that can be reached by swapping cow k with one other cow, or keeping it in its original position.

Wait, but the problem allows me to swap cow k with any other cow, or choose not to swap.

So, effectively, I can place cow k in any position, not just adjacent positions.

Therefore, I can choose any position to place cow k, as long as I swap it with the cow in that position.

So, I can choose to place cow k in any position, and the other cows adjust accordingly.

Therefore, I can consider placing cow k in any position, and compute the number of wins it can achieve from there.

Given that, I need to find the position where cow k can achieve the maximum number of wins.

So, I need to compute, for each possible position i, the number of wins cow k can achieve if placed in position i.

Then, choose the maximum among these.

But as discussed earlier, computing this for each position separately would be too slow.

So, I need a way to compute this efficiently for all positions.

Let me consider that if I place cow k in position i, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings between position i and the next higher-rated cow to the right of position i.

Similarly, I need to consider the cows to the left as well, but in the tournament structure, the champion progresses from left to right.

Wait, actually, in the tournament, the fights proceed from position 1 to n, with the champion advancing.

So, if I place cow k in position i, it will only get a chance to fight if it is the champion up to position i-1.

But for cow k to be the champion up to position i-1, it needs to have defeated all cows from position 1 to i-1.

But in reality, the champion up to position i-1 is determined by the highest-rated cow among positions 1 to i-1.

So, if the highest-rated cow among positions 1 to i-1 has a higher rating than cow k, then cow k cannot win any fights starting from position i.

Otherwise, if cow k has the highest rating among positions 1 to i, then it can start fighting from position i and win against the cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that cow k can only start fighting from its own position if it is the champion up to that point.

This seems too involved.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix cow k in position i, then the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings between position i and the next higher-rated cow to the right of position i.

This seems plausible, because cow k will win against all lower-rated cows until it faces a higher-rated cow.

So, if I can precompute for each position, the number of lower-rated cows between that position and the next higher-rated cow to the right, then I can choose the position with the maximum such number.

Additionally, I need to consider that placing cow k in position i requires swapping it with the cow originally in position i.

So, in effect, I can choose any position for cow k, and compute the number of wins it can achieve from there.

Then, choose the position that maximizes this number.

Given that, I can proceed as follows:

1. Find the rating of cow k, say r_k.

2. For each position i, find the number of cows with rating less than r_k between position i and the next higher-rated cow to the right of position i.

3. Choose the position i that maximizes this number.

This seems efficient, as I can precompute the next higher-rated cow to the right for each position, and then compute the number of lower-rated cows between i and that next higher-rated cow.

Then, iterate through all possible positions and choose the one with the maximum number of lower-rated cows.

But since n can be up to 1e5 per test case, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases being up to 1e5, this should be acceptable.

So, I can implement this approach.

But in the code provided, it seems to have a different approach.

Let me look at the given code.

The function func_1 takes the list a, which is the ratings of the cows.

But in the loop, it has:

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

k -= 1

print(func_1(l))

So, for each test case, it reads n, k, and the list a.

Then, it calls func_1(l), but func_1 seems to use global variables, which is not good.

Wait, in func_1, it uses a and k, but k is not defined within func_1.

This might cause issues.

But assuming that k is defined globally, let's see what func_1 does.

In func_1:

x = a[k]

ind = []

c = 0

for i in range(n):

if a[i] > x:

ind.append(i)

c += 1

if c == 2:

break

So, it finds the positions of the first two cows with ratings higher than cow k.

Then, it has some conditions based on ind being empty or having one or two elements.

If ind is empty, it returns n - 1, meaning cow k can win all fights.

If ind has one element, it does some calculations based on the position of that higher-rated cow.

If ind has two elements, it does more calculations.

But the logic seems unclear to me.

I need to verify if this logic aligns with the approach I was considering earlier.

In my earlier approach, I was thinking of placing cow k in any position and calculating the number of wins based on the number of lower-rated cows between that position and the next higher-rated cow to the right.

But in the given code, it seems to find the positions of the first two higher-rated cows and then decide based on that.

I'm not sure if this is correct.

Let me consider the first test case:

n = 6, k = 1 (0-indexed, position 0)

a = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

x = a[0] = 12

Find positions where a[i] > 12:

a[2] = 14 > 12, ind = [2], c = 1

a[3] = 11 < 12, skip

a[4] = 8 < 12, skip

a[5] = 3 < 12, skip

c != 2, so loop ends.

Then, ind = [2], c = 1

Since len(ind) == 1:

if ind[0] == 0: no

if ind[0] > k: 2 > 0, True

return ind[0] - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1

Which matches the first test case's output: 1

Second test case:

n = 6, k = 5 (0-indexed, position 4)

a = [7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]

x = a[4] = 727

Find positions where a[i] > 727:

No such positions, since 727 is the highest.

So, ind = [], c = 0

Since ind == [], return n - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5

But in the sample output, it's 2, not 5.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back at func_1:

if ind == []:

return n - 1

But in the second test case, ind is [], so it should return 5, but the correct answer is 2.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
