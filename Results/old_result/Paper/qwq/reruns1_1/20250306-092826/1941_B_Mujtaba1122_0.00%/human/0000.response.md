Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has an array of integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (which has to be between 2 and n-1, inclusive), and then decrementing a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1] by 1, 1, and 1 respectively, but a[i] is decremented by 2. The goal is to make all elements of the array zero using these operations.

First, I need to understand what this operation does. It seems like it's spreading out some sort of "deficit" from the center to its neighbors. But I need to think about it in a way that helps me make all elements zero.

Let me consider a small example to get a feel for it. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 1]. If I choose i=2, which is the middle element, I decrement a[1] by 1, a[2] by 2, and a[3] by 1. So, the array becomes [0, 1, 0]. Now, I can't choose i=2 again because a[2] is now 1, which is greater than 0, but I need to make it zero. Hmm, seems like I need to choose i=2 again. Wait, but the condition says to choose i such that 2 <= i <= n-1, and in this case, n=3, so i=2 is the only option.

So, applying the operation again on i=2: decrement a[1] by 1, but a[1] is already 0, so it stays 0; decrement a[2] by 2, making it -1; decrement a[3] by 1, making it -1. Oh, negative numbers are allowed apparently, since the problem says elements can be zero or positive, but in this case, it seems like I've overshot.

This suggests that maybe this approach isn't the best. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps instead of trying to apply the operation repeatedly until the array is zero, I should look for some invariant or some condition that must be satisfied for the array to be reducible to zero.

Let me think about the total sum of the array. Each operation decreases the total sum by 4 because a[i-1], a[i+1] are each decreased by 1, and a[i] is decreased by 2. So, the total sum decreases by 4 each time. Therefore, for the array to be reducible to zero, the total sum must be divisible by 4. Is that sufficient?

Wait, in my earlier example, [1, 3, 1], the sum is 5, which is not divisible by 4, and indeed, I couldn't make it zero. So, that seems necessary. But is it sufficient?

Let me try another example. Suppose the array is [2, 4, 2]. The sum is 8, which is divisible by 4. Let's see if I can make it zero.

Apply operation on i=2: a[1]=1, a[2]=2, a[3]=1.

Apply operation on i=2 again: a[1]=0, a[2]=0, a[3]=0.

Yes, it works. Another example: [4, 4, 4]. Sum is 12, which is divisible by 4.

Apply operation on i=2: a[1]=3, a[2]=2, a[3]=3.

Apply operation on i=2 again: a[1]=2, a[2]=0, a[3]=2.

Apply operation on i=1: but i=1 is not allowed, since i has to be between 2 and n-1.

Wait, so in this case, I can't make all elements zero because a[1] and a[3] are still 2 and 2. Seems like the sum condition is necessary but not sufficient.

I need a better approach. Maybe I should consider the differences between consecutive elements.

Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have the array a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]. Each operation affects a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1]. Specifically, it decreases a[i-1] and a[i+1] by 1 and a[i] by 2.

This looks similar to how certain transformations can be applied to sequences, perhaps related to linear algebra or difference equations.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a system of equations. Let's define variables for the number of times each operation is applied at each possible i.

Letâ€™s say x_i is the number of times the operation is applied at index i, where 2 <= i <= n-1.

Then, for each a[j], the total decrease is:

- For j=1: decrease is x_2 (since only operation at i=2 affects a[1]).

- For j=2: decrease is 2*x_2 + x_3.

- For j=3: decrease is x_2 + 2*x_3 + x_4.

- And so on, up to j=n-1 and j=n.

Wait, actually, for j=1, it's only affected by x_2; for j=2, affected by x_2 and x_3; and so on.

This seems like a system of linear equations where each equation corresponds to a[j] being set to zero after the operations.

So, for j from 1 to n:

a[j] - (sum of x_i's that affect a[j]) = 0

Specifically:

- a[1] - x_2 = 0

- a[2] - 2*x_2 - x_3 = 0

- a[3] - x_2 - 2*x_3 - x_4 = 0

- ...

- a[n-1] - x_{n-2} - 2*x_{n-1} = 0

- a[n] - x_{n-1} = 0

This is a system of n equations with n-2 variables (x_2 to x_{n-1}).

In general, solving such a system would tell us if there exists a solution where all x_i are non-negative integers.

However, solving a system of equations for each test case might be too slow if n is large and t is large, considering the constraints.

I need a smarter way to check if such x_i's exist.

Let me try to solve this system step by step for small n and see if I can find a pattern or a way to generalize it.

Take n=3: equations are:

a[1] - x_2 = 0 => x_2 = a[1]

a[2] - 2*x_2 - x_3 = 0 => x_3 = a[2] - 2*a[1]

a[3] - x_3 = 0 => x_3 = a[3]

So, from the first and third equations, x_2 = a[1] and x_3 = a[3]. Plugging into the second equation:

a[2] - 2*a[1] - a[3] = 0 => a[2] = 2*a[1] + a[3]

Therefore, for n=3, the condition is that a[2] must be equal to 2*a[1] + a[3].

If this holds, then x_2 = a[1] and x_3 = a[3], and both must be non-negative, which they are since a[j] are non-negative.

So, for n=3, the condition is a[2] == 2*a[1] + a[3].

Let me check with the earlier example: [1, 3, 1]. Is 3 == 2*1 + 1? Yes, 3 == 2 + 1, which holds, and we saw that it's possible to make all zeros.

Another example: [2, 4, 2]. Is 4 == 2*2 + 2? 4 == 4 + 2? 4 != 6, which doesn't hold, but earlier I thought it was possible. Wait, in my earlier attempt, I applied the operations and got to zero, but according to this, it shouldn't be possible. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let's re-examine. In [2, 4, 2], according to the condition, 4 should be equal to 2*2 + 2, which is 4 == 6, which is false. But when I applied the operations:

First operation on i=2: a[1]=1, a[2]=2, a[3]=1

Second operation on i=2: a[1]=0, a[2]=0, a[3]=0

It seems like it worked, but according to the condition, it shouldn't have. So maybe my condition is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Let me re-examine the equations for n=3:

a[1] - x_2 = 0 => x_2 = a[1]

a[2] - 2*x_2 - x_3 = 0 => x_3 = a[2] - 2*x_2 = a[2] - 2*a[1]

a[3] - x_3 = 0 => x_3 = a[3]

So, a[2] - 2*a[1] = a[3] => a[2] = 2*a[1] + a[3]

But in the [2,4,2] case, 4 == 2*2 + 2, which is 4 == 4 + 2 => 4 == 6, which is false. But it seems possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I didn't apply the operations correctly. Let's simulate it again.

Initial: [2,4,2]

Operation on i=2: a[1]=1, a[2]=2, a[3]=1

Operation on i=2 again: a[1]=0, a[2]=0, a[3]=0

Yes, it works. So maybe my condition is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that x_i can be applied multiple times, but in a way that the operations can overlap or something.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Let me consider the operations in reverse. Suppose I start from all zeros and apply the inverse operations to build up to the given array. The inverse operation would be:

Choose i (2 <= i <= n-1), then set a[i-1] +=1, a[i] +=2, a[i+1] +=1.

This looks similar to how Laplacian smoothing or certain diffusion processes work.

If I think about building up the array from zeros using these inverse operations, I need to find a combination of such operations that results in the given array.

This seems related to solving a system where each operation corresponds to adding a specific pattern to the array.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns or invariants in the array that must hold for it to be reducible to zero.

Let me consider the differences between consecutive elements.

Define d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 2 to n.

Maybe there's a relationship between these differences that can help.

Wait, perhaps cumulative sums or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a system where each operation corresponds to subtracting a specific vector from the array vector.

Given that, I can represent the operations as vectors and see if the target array is a linear combination of these operation vectors.

But with large n and t, this approach is not practical.

I need a more efficient way to check for each test case.

Let me consider the sum of the array again. As I noted earlier, each operation decreases the sum by 4.

Therefore, the total sum must be divisible by 4. But in the [2,4,2] example, sum is 8, which is divisible by 4, and it seems possible to make all zeros.

In the earlier [1,3,1] example, sum is 5, which is not divisible by 4, and it's impossible. Wait, but earlier I thought it was possible, but now I'm confused.

Wait, in the [2,4,2] example, sum is 8, divisible by 4, and it's possible. In [1,3,1], sum is 5, not divisible by 4, and it's impossible.

Wait, but earlier I thought [1,3,1] was possible, but maybe I made a mistake.

Let me try again.

Initial: [1,3,1]

Operation on i=2: [0,1,0]

Now, a[2] is 1, which is greater than 0, so I can't apply the operation again because a[i] needs to be at least 2 to apply the operation (since it's decremented by 2).

Wait, no, the condition is that i must be between 2 and n-1, and the operation can be applied as long as a[i-1], a[i], a[i+1] are sufficient.

In this case, a[1]=0, a[2]=1, a[3]=0.

To apply the operation at i=2, I need a[1]>=1, a[2]>=2, a[3]>=1.

But a[2]=1 < 2, so I can't apply the operation again.

Therefore, it's not possible to make all zeros in this case, which aligns with the sum not being divisible by 4.

So, perhaps the sum being divisible by 4 is a necessary and sufficient condition.

Wait, but in the [2,4,2] example, sum is 8, which is divisible by 4, and it's possible.

Another example: [0,0,0]. Sum is 0, which is divisible by 4, and it's already zero.

Another example: [4,4,4]. Sum is 12, which is divisible by 4.

Earlier, I tried to apply operations:

Operation on i=2: [2,2,2]

Operation on i=2 again: [0,0,0]

Yes, it works.

Another example: [1,2,1]. Sum is 4, which is divisible by 4.

Operation on i=2: [0,0,0]

Yes, it works.

Another example: [1,1,1]. Sum is 3, not divisible by 4, so impossible.

Seems like the sum being divisible by 4 is both necessary and sufficient.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the system of equations, and for n=3, I had a condition a[2]==2*a[1]+a[3], which is different from sum being divisible by 4.

But according to these examples, sum divisible by 4 seems to hold.

Let me check for n=3.

General case: a[1], a[2], a[3]

From the system:

x_2 = a[1]

x_3 = a[3]

And a[2] - 2*x_2 - x_3 = 0 => a[2] - 2*a[1] - a[3] = 0 => a[2] = 2*a[1] + a[3]

But in the sum, a[1] + a[2] + a[3] = a[1] + (2*a[1] + a[3]) + a[3] = 3*a[1] + 2*a[3]

For this sum to be divisible by 4, 3*a[1] + 2*a[3] must be divisible by 4.

But in the condition a[2]=2*a[1]+a[3], we have a[2] determined by a[1] and a[3].

So, perhaps in this specific case, the sum being divisible by 4 is equivalent to the condition a[2]=2*a[1]+a[3].

Let me see: 3*a[1] + 2*a[3] â‰¡ 0 mod 4, given that a[2]=2*a[1]+a[3].

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

If I consider that the operations reduce the sum by 4 each time, and the initial sum must be divisible by 4, then that should be the condition.

Given that, I can generalize that for any n, if the sum of the array is divisible by 4, then it's possible to make all elements zero.

But I need to verify this for larger n.

Let me take n=4, array [1,3,3,1]. Sum is 8, which is divisible by 4.

Apply operation on i=2: [0,1,2,1]

Apply operation on i=3: [0,1,0,0]

Now, a[2]=1, which is greater than 0, but I can't apply operation on i=2 again because a[2]=1 < 2.

So, it's not possible, but the sum is divisible by 4.

Wait, this is a counterexample. Sum is 8, divisible by 4, but I can't make all zeros.

Wait, perhaps I need a better strategy.

Initial: [1,3,3,1]

Operation on i=3: [1,2,1,0]

Operation on i=2: [0,0,0,-1]

Oh, now a[4] is -1, which is allowed since negatives are okay, but the goal is to make all zeros.

Wait, in my earlier attempt, I ended up with [0,1,0,0], which is not zero.

But perhaps I can apply operations differently.

Initial: [1,3,3,1]

Operation on i=2: [0,1,2,1]

Operation on i=3: [0,1,0,0]

Now, can I apply operation on i=2 again? a[1]=0, a[2]=1, a[3]=0.

To apply operation on i=2, need a[1]>=1, a[2]>=2, a[3]>=1.

But a[2]=1 < 2, so can't apply.

Therefore, it's not possible to make all zeros.

But the sum is divisible by 4.

So, the sum being divisible by 4 is necessary but not sufficient.

Back to the drawing board.

Maybe I need to look for another invariant.

Let me consider the differences between consecutive elements.

Define d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 2 to n.

Let's see if there's a pattern in d[i].

In the operation, when I apply it at i, it affects a[i-1], a[i], a[i+1].

So, d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]

After operation at i, d[i] becomes (a[i]-2) - (a[i-1]-1) = a[i] - a[i-1] -1 = d[i] -1

Similarly, d[i+1] = a[i+1] - a[i] becomes (a[i+1]-1) - (a[i]-2) = a[i+1] - a[i] +1 = d[i+1] +1

So, operation at i decreases d[i] by 1 and increases d[i+1] by 1.

Therefore, each operation transforms d[i] to d[i]-1 and d[i+1] to d[i+1]+1.

This suggests that the sum of d[i] over all i is invariant under the operations because the decrease in d[i] is compensated by the increase in d[i+1].

But what is the sum of d[i]? Sum from i=2 to n of d[i] = sum from i=2 to n of (a[i] - a[i-1}) = a[n] - a[1].

Therefore, a[n] - a[1] remains unchanged regardless of the operations performed.

Therefore, for the array to be reducible to all zeros, we must have a[n] - a[1] = 0, meaning a[1] = a[n].

This is a new condition: a[1] must equal a[n].

In the earlier counterexample, [1,3,3,1], a[1]=1 and a[n]=1, which satisfies a[1]=a[n].

In the [2,4,2] example, a[1]=2 and a[3]=2, which also satisfies a[1]=a[n].

In the [1,3,1] example, a[1]=1 and a[3]=1, which satisfies a[1]=a[n].

In the [4,4,4] example, a[1]=4 and a[3]=4, which satisfies a[1]=a[n].

In the [1,2,1] example, a[1]=1 and a[3]=1, which satisfies a[1]=a[n].

In the [1,1,1] example, a[1]=1 and a[3]=1, which satisfies a[1]=a[n].

Wait, but earlier I thought [1,3,3,1] was not possible, but it satisfies a[1]=a[n].

So, perhaps a[1]=a[n] is necessary but not sufficient.

I need to think further.

Given that a[n] - a[1] remains invariant, and for the array to be zero, a[n] - a[1] must be zero, so a[1] must equal a[n].

But is this the only condition?

In the earlier counterexample, [1,3,3,1], sum is 8, divisible by 4, and a[1]=a[n], but I couldn't make all zeros.

Wait, perhaps I didn't apply the operations correctly.

Let me try again.

Initial: [1,3,3,1]

Operation on i=3: [1,2,1,0]

Operation on i=2: [0,0,0,-1]

Hmm, now a[4]=-1, which is allowed, but I have a[-1], which is not zero.

Is there a way to make a[4]=0?

Wait, perhaps I need to apply operations differently.

Alternative approach:

Start from the ends and work towards the center.

But it's getting too ad-hoc.

Maybe I need to find a way to express the operations in terms of linear algebra or find a way to solve for the number of operations at each i.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the operations can be represented as a matrix, and solving the system corresponds to finding the inverse of that matrix.

But with large n, this is not practical.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to iteratively apply the operations in a way that guarantees to reach zero if possible.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different invariant or condition.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the array as a whole and see if it can be expressed as a combination of certain base patterns corresponding to the operations.

Each operation corresponds to subtracting the array [0,...,0
