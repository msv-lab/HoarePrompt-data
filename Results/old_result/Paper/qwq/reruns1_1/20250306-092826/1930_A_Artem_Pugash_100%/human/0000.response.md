Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score at the end.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a list of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is as large as possible. Since I have to do this over multiple test cases, efficiency might be important, but given that n can be up to 50, and there are up to 5000 test cases, I need to make sure my solution is optimized.

Let me think about how to approach this. If I sort the list of 2n numbers, maybe that will help. Let's consider the first example:

n = 1

Numbers: 2, 3

If I sort them: 2, 3

Then, I can pair 2 and 3, and take the min, which is 2. That's the same as the example.

Second example:

n = 2

Numbers: 1, 1, 2, 1

Sorted: 1, 1, 1, 2

Now, I need to pair them in a way to maximize the sum of mins.

Option 1: pair 1 and 1, get min=1, then pair 1 and 2, get min=1. Total score=2.

Option 2: pair 1 and 2, get min=1, then pair 1 and 1, get min=1. Total score=2.

Same result either way.

Third example:

n = 3

Numbers: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1

Sorted: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1

Pair any two, min=1, do this 3 times, total score=3.

Seems straightforward.

Wait, but is sorting always the way to go?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose n=2

Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4

Sorted: 1, 2, 3, 4

Option 1: pair 1 and 2, get min=1; pair 3 and 4, get min=3. Total=4.

Option 2: pair 1 and 3, get min=1; pair 2 and 4, get min=2. Total=3.

Option 3: pair 1 and 4, get min=1; pair 2 and 3, get min=2. Total=3.

So, the first option is better, total=4.

Is there a better way than sorting?

It seems sorting helps because by sorting, I can pair the smallest available numbers together, ensuring that the min of each pair is as large as possible.

Wait, but in the first example, pairing the smallest two gives min=1, and the next smallest two give min=1, total=2.

But is there a way to get a higher score?

In the second example, it's not possible to get more than 2.

In the third example, all are 1s, so 3 is the max.

So, sorting seems to work.

But let me think about another example.

n=3

Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Sorted: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Pair 1 and 2, min=1; pair 3 and 4, min=3; pair 5 and 6, min=5. Total=9.

Is there a better way?

If I pair 1 and 3, min=1; pair 2 and 4, min=2; pair 5 and 6, min=5. Total=8.

Or pair 1 and 4, min=1; pair 2 and 5, min=2; pair 3 and 6, min=3. Total=6.

So, the first way is better.

So, it seems that pairing the smallest two, next smallest two, and so on, gives the maximum score.

Is there a mathematical proof for this?

Yes, I think so.

If I sort the array in non-decreasing order, a1 <= a2 <= ... <= a_{2n}.

Then, pairing a1 and a2, a3 and a4, ..., a_{2n-1} and a_{2n}.

The sum of mins would be a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Is this always the maximum?

In the examples above, it seems to be.

Let me see if there's a counterexample.

Suppose n=2

Numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3

Sorted: 1, 1, 2, 3

Pair 1 and 1, get min=1; pair 2 and 3, get min=2. Total=3.

Alternative pairing: pair 1 and 2, get min=1; pair 1 and 3, get min=1. Total=2.

So, the first way is better.

Another pairing: pair 1 and 3, min=1; pair 1 and 2, min=1. Total=2.

Still, 3 is better.

So, pairing the smallest two together gives a better score.

Wait, but in this case, pairing the two smallest ones gives a better score.

Is there any case where pairing larger numbers together gives a better sum?

Let me think.

Suppose n=2

Numbers: 1, 2, 2, 3

Sorted: 1, 2, 2, 3

Option 1: pair 1 and 2, min=1; pair 2 and 3, min=2. Total=3.

Option 2: pair 1 and 2, min=1; pair 2 and 3, min=2. Total=3.

Option 3: pair 1 and 3, min=1; pair 2 and 2, min=2. Total=3.

Same result.

Seems consistent.

Another example:

n=3

Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

As before, pairing a1 and a2, a3 and a4, a5 and a6 gives 1+3+5=9.

Is there any other pairing that gives more than 9?

Suppose pair 1 and 3, min=1; pair 2 and 4, min=2; pair 5 and 6, min=5. Total=8.

Or pair 1 and 4, min=1; pair 2 and 5, min=2; pair 3 and 6, min=3. Total=6.

No, 9 is better.

So, it seems pairing the smallest two, next smallest two, etc., gives the maximum sum.

Therefore, sorting the array and summing every second element starting from the smallest seems to be the optimal strategy.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))

score = 0

for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):

score += l[i]

print(score)

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, reads 2n integers, sorts them, and sums every second element starting from the first (i.e., the smallest ones).

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, this should be correct.

But let's verify with the examples.

First example:

n=1

Numbers: 2,3

Sorted: 2,3

Sum l[0] = 2

Which matches the example output.

Second example:

n=2

Numbers:1 1 2 1

Sorted:1,1,1,2

Sum l[0] + l[2] =1 +1=2

Which matches the example output.

Third example:

n=3

Numbers:1 1 1 1 1 1

Sorted:1,1,1,1,1,1

Sum l[0] + l[2] + l[4] =1+1+1=3

Which matches the example output.

So, it seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let's consider another test case.

Suppose n=3

Numbers:1,2,3,4,5,6

Sorted:1,2,3,4,5,6

Sum l[0] + l[2] + l[4] =1+3+5=9

Is this the maximum possible?

Yes, as previously established.

Another test case:

n=2

Numbers:1,1,2,3

Sorted:1,1,2,3

Sum l[0] + l[2] =1 +2=3

Which is better than other pairings.

Seems correct.

Is there any edge case where this might fail?

Suppose n=1

Numbers:1,1

Sorted:1,1

Sum l[0]=1

Which is correct.

Or n=1

Numbers:1,2

Sorted:1,2

Sum l[0]=1

Which is correct, as pairing 1 and 2 gives min=1.

What about n=2

Numbers:1,1,1,1

Sorted:1,1,1,1

Sum l[0] + l[2] =1 +1=2

Which is correct.

Or n=3

Numbers:1,1,1,1,1,1

Sum l[0] + l[2] + l[4] =1+1+1=3

Correct.

Seems consistent.

Is there a case where summing every second element doesn't give the maximum?

I can't think of one. It seems that this strategy always works.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
