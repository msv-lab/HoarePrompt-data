Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

Vasya has an array a of length n, and he wants to add a permutation p of length n to it. So, p is a rearrangement of the numbers from 1 to n. After adding p to a (i.e., a_i becomes a_i + p_i for each i), Vasya wants to find out the maximum number of elements in the new array that are equal to the same number.

My task is to determine, for each test case, what the maximum possible frequency of any number in the modified array can be.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is a sequence containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, in any order. For example, for n=3, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Given that p is a permutation, the values p_i range from 1 to n, each appearing exactly once.

So, for the array a, after adding p, each a_i increases by some unique value between 1 and n.

I need to choose p in such a way that, after this addition, as many a_i's as possible become equal to the same value.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Suppose I have the array a, and I want to make as many a_i + p_i as equal as possible. Since p_i are distinct and range from 1 to n, I need to find a target value t such that as many a_i + p_i as possible equal t.

In other words, for each possible t, I can try to count how many pairs (i, p_i) satisfy a_i + p_i = t.

But iterating over all possible t seems inefficient, especially since a_i can be up to 10^9.

Is there a smarter way to do this?

Let me consider that p_i are a permutation from 1 to n. So, p_i are distinct and cover all integers from 1 to n.

Given that, for each a_i, a_i + p_i can be thought of as a_i + some unique number between 1 and n.

I need to maximize the number of a_i + p_i that are equal.

Wait a minute, since p_i are all distinct, a_i + p_i are like a_i shifted by distinct values.

This seems similar to matching a_i's to p_i's such that a_i + p_i are as concentrated as possible.

Maybe I can sort the a_i's and choose p_i's in a way that minimizes the spread of a_i + p_i.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first example:

n = 2

a = [1, 2]

Possible permutations p: [1,2] or [2,1]

If p = [1,2], then a becomes [1+1=2, 2+2=4]

If p = [2,1], then a becomes [1+2=3, 2+1=3]

So, in the second case, both elements become 3, which is better.

So, the answer is 2.

Another example:

n = 4

a = [7,1,4,1]

Possible p: any permutation of [1,2,3,4]

One possible p is [2,3,1,4]

Then a becomes [7+2=9, 1+3=4, 4+1=5, 1+4=5]

So, we have [9,4,5,5], where 5 appears twice.

Is this the best possible? Seems like it's 2.

Looking at the problem, it seems that the maximum frequency we can achieve is roughly n divided by something, but I need to think carefully.

Another way to look at it is to consider that p_i are distinct and cover 1 to n, so a_i + p_i are a_i shifted by distinct values.

If I sort a_i, and pair the smallest a_i with the largest p_i, or vice versa, to try to make a_i + p_i as equal as possible.

Wait, in the first example, sorting a = [1,2], p = [2,1], so a_i + p_i = [3,3].

In the second example, sorting a = [1,1,4,7], p = [4,3,2,1], a_i + p_i = [5,4,6,8], which doesn't help.

Wait, in the second example, p = [2,3,1,4], a_i + p_i = [9,4,5,5].

Another p: [1,2,3,4], a_i + p_i = [8,3,7,5].

Seems like choosing p carefully can maximize the frequency.

Is there a systematic way to choose p to maximize the frequency?

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix a target value t, and I want to see how many a_i + p_i can equal t.

For a given t, I need to find the number of pairs (i, p_i) such that a_i + p_i = t.

Since p_i are a permutation from 1 to n, p_i are distinct.

So, for each i, p_i is unique, and I can only use each p_i once.

Therefore, for a given t, the number of such pairs is the number of i where t - a_i is in the set {1,2,...,n}, and each t - a_i is unique because p_i are unique.

Wait, but p_i are distinct, so for different i, t - a_i must be different.

So, for a given t, the number of pairs where a_i + p_i = t is at most the number of distinct t - a_i that are in {1,2,...,n}.

But this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of frequency.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the differences between the elements.

Wait, perhaps sorting a helps.

Let me sort a in ascending order.

Let's sort a: a_sorted.

Now, I need to pair each a_i with a p_i from 1 to n, and make a_i + p_i as equal as possible.

I need to maximize the number of a_i + p_i that are equal.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order, and assign p_i in a way that a_i + p_i are as equal as possible.

One idea is to assign the smallest p_i to the largest a_i, so that a_i + p_i are more likely to be equal.

Wait, let's try with the second example.

a = [1,1,4,7], sorted a = [1,1,4,7]

Assign p = [4,3,2,1]

Then a + p = [5,4,6,8]

Alternatively, p = [1,2,3,4]

a + p = [2,3,7,11]

Another p = [3,4,1,2]

a + p = [4,5,5,9]

Here, two 5's.

So, by assigning p carefully, I can get two elements to be equal.

Is it possible to get three equal elements?

Suppose I try to make three elements equal.

Suppose I want a_i + p_i = t for three different i's.

Then, for three different i's, p_i = t - a_i.

But p_i must be distinct and within 1 to n.

So, if t - a_i are all distinct and within 1 to n, then it's possible.

But in this example, a = [1,1,4,7], let's see:

Suppose I choose t = 5.

Then p_i = 5 - a_i.

So, for a=1, p=4; a=1, p=4; a=4, p=1; a=7, p=-2.

Wait, p cannot be -2, which is invalid.

So, only the first three would be valid if p_i are adjusted.

Wait, but p_i must be a permutation of 1 to n.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the differences between a_i and a_j.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the frequency of a_i + p_i for all possible p.

But that seems too broad.

Another idea: Since p_i are a permutation from 1 to n, the sum a_i + p_i can be thought of as a_i shifted by a unique value between 1 and n.

So, to maximize the frequency of a particular sum, I need to see how many a_i can be shifted to the same value using distinct shifts from 1 to n.

Let me think about it in terms of matching.

I need to match each a_i to a unique p_i such that as many a_i + p_i as possible are equal to some t.

To maximize the frequency, I need to find the t that can be achieved by the maximum number of a_i + p_i, with p_i being distinct.

This sounds like finding the maximum number of a_i's that can be paired with distinct p_i's such that a_i + p_i equals t.

For each t, the number of such pairs is the number of i where t - a_i is a distinct p_i in 1 to n.

So, for each t, the number of such pairs is the number of i where t - a_i is in [1,n], and all t - a_i are distinct.

So, for a given t, the maximum number of pairs is the size of the largest subset of i where t - a_i are distinct and in [1,n].

This is equivalent to the number of unique t - a_i that fall within [1,n].

But I need to maximize this over all possible t.

Wait, perhaps I need to find t such that as many t - a_i as possible are distinct integers between 1 and n.

Since p_i are a permutation of 1 to n, p_i are distinct and within 1 to n.

So, for a given t, the number of valid i where t - a_i is in [1,n] and all t - a_i are distinct.

This seems tricky to maximize over t.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider sorting a in ascending order.

Let's sort a: a_sorted.

Now, assign p_i in a way that a_sorted[i] + p_i are equal as much as possible.

One idea is to assign p_i in descending order to a_sorted[i].

Wait, in the first example, a = [1,2], sorted as [1,2], assign p = [2,1], so a + p = [3,3].

In the second example, a = [1,1,4,7], sorted as [1,1,4,7], assign p = [4,3,2,1], so a + p = [5,4,6,8]. But in another assignment, p = [3,4,1,2], a + p = [4,5,5,9], which has two 5's.

Is there a way to get three equal elements?

Suppose I try to make a_sorted[0] + p[0] = a_sorted[1] + p[1] = a_sorted[2] + p[2].

So, a[0] + p[0] = a[1] + p[1] = a[2] + p[2].

Then, p[0] = t - a[0], p[1] = t - a[1], p[2] = t - a[2].

But p[i] must be distinct and in [1,n].

So, for t - a[0], t - a[1], t - a[2] to be distinct and in [1,n].

In the second example, a = [1,1,4,7].

Suppose t = 5.

Then p[0] = 5 - 1 = 4, p[1] = 5 - 1 = 4 (but need to be distinct), p[2] = 5 - 4 = 1, p[3] = 5 - 7 = -2 (invalid).

So, even if I adjust p[1] to be 4 and p[0] to be something else, there are conflicts.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that p_i are a permutation of 1 to n, so their sum is n(n+1)/2.

Similarly, the sum of a_i + p_i is sum(a) + n(n+1)/2.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the problem as trying to make as many a_i + p_i as possible equal to the same t.

To maximize the frequency, I need to maximize the number of a_i + p_i that equal t, for some t.

This is equivalent to maximizing the number of p_i that equal t - a_i, where p_i are distinct and in [1,n].

So, for each t, I need to see how many t - a_i are distinct and in [1,n].

I need to choose t such that the number of t - a_i that are distinct and in [1,n] is maximized.

So, the problem reduces to finding t such that the number of unique t - a_i in [1,n] is maximized.

Wait, but I need to maximize the frequency, which is the number of a_i's that can have p_i = t - a_i, with p_i being distinct and in [1,n].

So, it's about finding t such that the number of a_i where t - a_i is in [1,n] is maximized, with all t - a_i being distinct.

This seems similar to finding the t that maximizes the number of unique t - a_i in [1,n].

But I need an efficient way to compute this, given that n can be up to 2e5 and a_i can be up to 1e9.

Brute-forcing over all possible t seems infeasible.

Is there a smarter way?

Let me consider sorting a in ascending order.

Let's sort a: a_sorted.

Now, I need to choose t such that t - a_sorted[i] are distinct and in [1,n].

Since a_sorted is sorted, t - a_sorted[i] should be distinct and in [1,n].

I can think of t - a_sorted[i] as p_i, which must be distinct and in [1,n].

So, for a given t, the p_i's would be t - a_sorted[i], and they need to be distinct and in [1,n].

To maximize the number of such i's, I need to choose t such that as many t - a_sorted[i] as possible are distinct and in [1,n].

This sounds like finding t where the number of unique t - a_sorted[i] in [1,n] is maximized.

But this still seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can fix t and see how many a_sorted[i] + p_i = t, with p_i being distinct and in [1,n].

But p_i = t - a_sorted[i], and p_i must be distinct and in [1,n].

So, for each t, the number of such p_i is the number of unique t - a_sorted[i] that are in [1,n].

But I need to maximize this over t.

This seems similar to finding t such that t - a_sorted[i] falls within [1,n] and are unique.

This sounds like finding t where t is in the range [a_sorted[i] + 1, a_sorted[i] + n].

Because p_i = t - a_sorted[i], and p_i must be in [1,n], so t must be in [a_sorted[i] + 1, a_sorted[i] + n].

But I need to maximize the overlap of t across all a_sorted[i].

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of t being in the intersection of [a_sorted[i] + 1, a_sorted[i] + n] for as many i as possible.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order: a_sorted.

Now, assign p_i in a way that a_sorted[i] + p_i are as equal as possible.

One way is to assign p_i in descending order to a_sorted[i].

Wait, in the first example, a = [1,2], sorted as [1,2], assign p = [2,1], so a + p = [3,3].

In the second example, a = [1,1,4,7], sorted as [1,1,4,7], assign p = [4,3,2,1], a + p = [5,4,6,8], which has no duplicates.

Wait, but in another assignment, p = [3,4,1,2], a + p = [4,5,5,9], which has two 5's.

Is there a better way?

Suppose I try to make a_sorted[i] + p_i = t for as many i as possible.

So, p_i = t - a_sorted[i].

Since p_i must be distinct and in [1,n], t - a_sorted[i] must be distinct and in [1,n].

So, for a given t, the number of valid i is the number of unique t - a_sorted[i] that are in [1,n].

To maximize this, I need to choose t such that as many t - a_sorted[i] as possible are distinct and in [1,n].

This seems like finding t where the differences t - a_sorted[i] are as unique as possible and within [1,n].

But how to find such t efficiently?

Let me consider that a_sorted is sorted in ascending order.

So, a_sorted[i] <= a_sorted[i+1].

Then, t - a_sorted[i+1] <= t - a_sorted[i], assuming a_sorted[i+1] >= a_sorted[i].

But p_i must be distinct and in [1,n].

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible t and find the one with the maximum number of valid and distinct p_i.

But with a_i up to 1e9 and n up to 2e5, this seems inefficient.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that p_i are a permutation of [1,n], so they are distinct integers from 1 to n.

I need to map each a_i to a unique p_i such that a_i + p_i is as close as possible to some target t.

Alternatively, I can think of it as minimizing the spread of a_i + p_i.

But I need to maximize the frequency of the most frequent value in a_i + p_i.

Wait, perhaps I can sort a in ascending order and p in descending order, and see what happens.

In the first example, a_sorted = [1,2], p_desc = [2,1], a + p = [3,3], which is good.

In the second example, a_sorted = [1,1,4,7], p_desc = [4,3,2,1], a + p = [5,4,6,8], which has no duplicates.

Wait, but in another assignment, p = [3,4,1,2], a + p = [4,5,5,9], which has two duplicates.

Is there a systematic way to assign p_i to maximize duplicates in a + p?

Wait, perhaps I can sort a in ascending order and assign p in a way that minimizes the differences between a_i + p_i.

One way is to assign the largest p_i to the smallest a_i, so that a_i + p_i are more likely to be equal.

Wait, in the first example, a_sorted = [1,2], p = [2,1], a + p = [3,3].

In the second example, a_sorted = [1,1,4,7], p = [4,3,2,1], a + p = [5,4,6,8].

But in another assignment, p = [3,4,1,2], a + p = [4,5,5,9], which has two duplicates.

Is there a better assignment?

Suppose I assign p = [2,3,1,4], a + p = [3,4,5,11], which has only one duplicate.

So, p = [3,4,1,2] gives two duplicates.

Is it possible to get three duplicates?

Suppose I try to make three a_i + p_i equal.

Suppose t = 5.

Then p_i = 5 - a_i.

So, for a=1, p=4; a=1, p=4; a=4, p=1; a=7, p=-2 (invalid).

So, only two p_i can be 4, but p_i must be unique.

Wait, but p_i must be distinct.

So, only one p_i can be 4.

Hence, only two a_i can have p_i such that a_i + p_i = 5.

Is there a t where three a_i can have unique p_i such that a_i + p_i = t?

Suppose t = 4.

Then p_i = 4 - a_i.

For a=1, p=3; a=1, p=3 (but p_i must be unique); a=4, p=0 (invalid); a=7, p=-3 (invalid).

So, only one valid p_i = 3 for a=1.

Similarly, for t=5, only two valid p_i=4 for one a=1, and p_i=1 for a=4.

Hence, maximum frequency is 2.

Seems like in this example, the answer is 2.

Looking back, in the first example, answer is 2; in the second, answer is 2; in the third, answer is 3.

Wait, looking at the sample output, it's 2,2,3,2,1,1,2.

So, in some cases, it's possible to get higher frequencies.

How?

Let's look at the third example.

n=3

a= [103,102,104]

Possible p: [1,2,3]

Assign p=[2,3,1], a + p = [105,105,105], which is three duplicates.

So, in this case, it's possible to make all three elements equal.

So, the answer is 3.

But in the second example, it's only possible to make two elements equal.

So, how to generalize this?

Looking back, in the third example, a_sorted = [102,103,104], p_sorted_desc = [3,2,1], a + p = [105,105,105].

So, by assigning the largest p
