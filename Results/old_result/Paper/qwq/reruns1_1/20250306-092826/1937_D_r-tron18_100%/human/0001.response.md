Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There's a one-dimensional grid of length n, and each cell contains either a '<' or a '>'. When a pinball is placed on one of these cells, it moves according to the direction of the arrow in that cell. If it's '<', it moves left, if '>', it moves right. But there's a twist: after the pinball moves, the arrow in the cell it just left flips direction. So if it was '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa. The pinball keeps moving until it goes off the grid either to the left or to the right, and I need to figure out how many seconds it takes for the pinball to exit the grid from each starting position.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. For each cell from 1 to n, if I place a pinball there and let it go, how many seconds will it take to exit the grid? The grid is of length n, and each cell has either '<' or '>'. The pinball changes the arrow direction after moving, which means the grid's state changes with each move.

Let me consider a small example to get a feel for it. Suppose n=3 and s="><<".

Starting at position 1:

- s = "><<"

- Pinball is at 1, s[1]='>', so it moves right to position 2.

- After moving, s[1] flips to '<', so now s="><<"

- Now at position 2, s[2]='<', so it moves left to position 1.

- s[2] flips to '>', s="><>"

- At position 1, s[1]='<', so it moves left out of the grid.

- Total moves: 3 seconds.

So for position 1, the answer is 3.

Starting at position 2:

- s = "><<"

- Pinball at 2, s[2]='<', moves left to position 1.

- s[2] flips to '>', s=">><"

- At position 1, s[1]='>', moves right to position 2.

- s[1] flips to '<', s="><>"

- At position 2, s[2]='>', moves right to position 3.

- s[2] flips to '<', s="><<"

- At position 3, s[3]='<', moves left to position 2.

- s[3] flips to '>', s="><>"

- At position 2, s[2]='<', moves left to position 1.

- s[2] flips to '>', s="><>"

- At position 1, s[1]='<', moves left out of the grid.

- Total moves: 6 seconds.

So for position 2, the answer is 6.

Starting at position 3:

- s = "><<"

- Pinball at 3, s[3]='<', moves left to position 2.

- s[3] flips to '>', s=">><"

- At position 2, s[2]='>', moves right to position 3.

- s[2] flips to '<', s="><<"

- At position 3, s[3]='>', moves right out of the grid.

- Total moves: 3 seconds.

Wait, but according to the example in the problem, for n=3 and s="><<", the outputs are 3, 6, 5. But according to my simulation, it's 3, 6, 3. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong in the third case.

Let me try again for position 3:

- s = "><<"

- Pinball at 3, s[3]='<', moves left to position 2.

- s[3] flips to '>', s=">><"

- At position 2, s[2]='>', moves right to position 3.

- s[2] flips to '<', s="><<"

- At position 3, s[3]='>', moves right out of the grid.

- Total moves: 3

But the example says 5 for the third position. Maybe I need to count the flips correctly.

Wait, perhaps the flipping happens after the move, so the pinball moves first, then the cell it was in flips.

Let me try again:

Starting at position 3:

- s = "><<"

- Pinball at 3, s[3]='<', so it moves left to position 2.

- After moving, s[3] flips to '>', so s=">><"

- At position 2, s[2]='>', moves right to position 3.

- s[2] flips to '<', s="><<"

- At position 3, s[3]='>', moves right out of the grid.

- s[3] flips to '<', but the pinball is already out.

- Total moves: 3

But the example shows 5. Maybe I need to consider that the flipping affects future moves.

Wait, perhaps the flipping affects the path in a way that leads to more moves.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula to calculate the number of steps without simulating each move.

I recall that in some problems involving flipping elements, there might be a way to model the movement as some kind of path or cycle.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the grid as a state machine, where each state represents the current configuration of the arrows, and the pinball's position.

But that seems too complex, especially since n can be up to 5*10^5, and t up to 10^5, with the total n across all test cases up to 5*10^5.

I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case or better.

Looking back at the problem, it says that for each query (each i from 1 to n), I need to calculate how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on the i-th cell, and that it will always leave the grid in finite time.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently for each i.

Let me think about what happens when the pinball moves.

Each time the pinball moves, it flips the arrow in the cell it just left.

This means that the grid's configuration changes with each move, which makes predicting the path non-trivial.

But perhaps there's a way to model this behavior without simulating each step.

I recall that in some problems, especially those involving flipping bits or directions, there might be a way to represent the overall movement in terms of the initial configuration.

Let me consider the movement of the pinball.

If the pinball is at position i and s_i = '<', it moves left to i-1, and s_i becomes '>'.

Similarly, if s_i = '>', it moves right to i+1, and s_i becomes '<'.

This process repeats until the pinball goes out of the grid.

I need to find the number of steps until the pinball exits.

This seems like a deterministic process for each starting position, but simulating it directly for large n is not feasible due to time constraints.

I need a smarter way.

Maybe I can think of the movement in terms of the number of times the pinball changes direction or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to model this using graph traversal or some kind of state transition.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents the pinball's position and the grid's state, but that seems too memory-intensive.

I need a better approach.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix a starting position and trace the path the pinball takes until it exits.

I need to keep track of the grid's state as the pinball moves.

But since the grid can be large, I need a way to generalize this.

Maybe I can consider that each time the pinball visits a cell, it flips the arrow, which effectively changes the direction for future passes.

Wait, but it's not just future passes; it affects the current path as well because the arrow is flipped after the move.

This is tricky.

Let me try to find a pattern or invariant in the movement.

Suppose the pinball starts at position i.

If s_i = '>', it moves right to i+1, and s_i becomes '<'.

At position i+1, if s_{i+1} = '<', it moves left, and s_{i+1} becomes '>', and so on.

This back-and-forth movement seems to suggest that the pinball might be bouncing between left and right, flipping arrows as it goes.

But I need a way to calculate the total steps without simulating each one.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times the pinball changes direction.

Wait, maybe I can model the movement in terms of the number of times it hits a cell and flips it.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider that each time the pinball moves, it's effectively inverting the arrow in the cell it left.

So, if I consider the sequence of moves, each move changes the grid's configuration.

This makes it difficult to predict the path without simulation.

Is there a mathematical formula or a pattern that can be exploited based on the initial string s?

Let me consider some small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Example 1:

n=3

s="><<"

From the earlier simulation, for starting positions 1,2,3, the steps are 3,6,5.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 3,6,3, but according to the problem, it's 3,6,5.

So perhaps my simulation for position 3 was incorrect.

Let me try again for position 3:

- s = "><<"

- Pinball at 3, s[3]='<', moves left to 2.

- s[3] flips to '>', s=">><"

- At position 2, s[2]='>', moves right to 3.

- s[2] flips to '<', s="><<"

- At position 3, s[3]='>', moves right out of the grid.

- s[3] flips to '<', but pinball is already out.

- Total moves: 3

But according to the problem, it should be 5. Maybe I missed some flips.

Wait, perhaps the flipping happens before the movement, but according to the problem statement, it's after the movement.

Let me check the problem statement again: "After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted."

So, indeed, after moving, the cell it just left is flipped.

Maybe I need to count the steps more carefully.

Starting at position 3:

1. At position 3, s[3]='<', move left to position 2.

2. Flip s[3] to '>', so s=">><"

3. At position 2, s[2]='>', move right to position 3.

4. Flip s[2] to '<', so s="><<"

5. At position 3, s[3]='>', move right out of the grid.

6. Flip s[3] to '<', but the pinball is already out.

Total steps: 3

But the problem says it should be 5. Maybe I need to consider that some moves are being double-counted or there's an error in my simulation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that between steps, the grid's state changes, affecting the path in a way that leads to more steps.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the flipping affects the number of times the pinball crosses certain cells.

This is confusing. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that each time the pinball passes through a cell, it flips the arrow, which might later affect its path.

This seems similar to toggling switches or something, where the state changes with each passage.

Perhaps I can model the path in terms of the number of times the pinball crosses certain boundaries.

Wait, maybe I can think of the grid as a series of directions that change over time, and find a way to calculate the exit time based on the initial configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent this problem using graph theory or some kind of state machine.

But given the constraints, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

Let me look at the provided program and try to understand what it's doing.

The program defines two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 seems to take an array and a number of times, and returns the difference between the last element and the element at a certain position, considering negative indices.

func_2 takes the string s1 and n, and seems to calculate prefix and suffix sums for positions with '>' and '<'.

It then computes the answer for each position based on some calculations involving these prefix and suffix sums.

This seems optimized, likely O(n) per test case, which would be acceptable given the constraints.

But I need to verify if this program correctly computes the required values.

Given that in the first test case, for n=3 and s="><<", the output should be 3 6 5, and the program seems to produce that, it might be correct.

But to be sure, let's consider another test case.

Second test case:

n=4

s="<<<<"

Output: 1 2 3 4

Let's simulate position 1:

- s="<<<<"

- At 1, '<', move left out of the grid.

- Flip s[1] to '>', s="><<<"

- Total steps: 1

Position 2:

- At 2, '<', move left to 1.

- Flip s[2] to '>', s="><<<"

- At 1, '>', move right to 2.

- Flip s[1] to '<', s="><<<"

- At 2, '>', move right to 3.

- Flip s[2] to '<', s="<< <"

- At 3, '<', move left to 2.

- Flip s[3] to '>', s="<<<>"

- At 2, '<', move left to 1.

- Flip s[2] to '>', s="<><>"

- At 1, '<', move left out of the grid.

- Flip s[1] to '>', s=">><>"

- Total steps: 5, but according to the output, it should be 2.

Wait, that doesn't match. The output says 1 2 3 4, but my simulation for position 2 gives 5 steps, which doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps my simulation is wrong.

Wait, let's try again:

Position 2:

- s="<<<<"

- At 2, '<', move left to 1.

- Flip s[2] to '>', s="><<<<" (wait, n=4, so s="><<<"

- At 1, '>', move right to 2.

- Flip s[1] to '<', s="><<<"

- At 2, '<', move left to 1.

- Flip s[2] to '>', s="><><"

- At 1, '<', move left out of the grid.

- Flip s[1] to '>', s=">><<"

- Total steps: 3

Still not matching the output of 2 for position 2.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Let me try again:

- Start at 2, s="<<<<"

- Step 1: move left to 1 (s[2] becomes '>'), s="><<<<" (n=4, so s="><<<")

- Step 2: at 1, '>', move right to 2 (s[1] becomes '<'), s="><<<"

- Step 3: at 2, '<', move left to 1 (s[2] becomes '<'), s="<< <"

- Step 4: at 1, '<', move left out of the grid (s[1] becomes '>'), s=">><<"

- Total steps: 4

Still not matching the output of 2.

Wait, perhaps the output is incorrect, or maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says "It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps."

But in this case, for s="<<<<", starting at position 2, it seems to take 4 steps to exit, but the output says 2.

Wait, perhaps the output is incorrect, or I'm miscounting.

Let me see what the program outputs for this case.

Given n=4, s="<<<<", the program outputs 1 2 3 4.

But according to my simulation for position 2, it should be 4, but the program says 2.

This discrepancy suggests that either my simulation is wrong or the program is incorrect.

Given that for position 2, the program outputs 2, but my simulation shows 4, the program might be incorrect.

Wait, maybe the program is correct and I'm making a mistake in simulation.

Let me try again.

Position 2:

- s="<<<<"

- Step 1: at 2, '<', move left to 1, s[2] becomes '>', s="><<<<" (n=4, so s="><<<")

- Step 2: at 1, '>', move right to 2, s[1] becomes '<', s="><<<"

- Step 3: at 2, '<', move left to 1, s[2] becomes '<', s="<< <"

- Step 4: at 1, '<', move left out of the grid, s[1] becomes '>', s=">><<"

Total steps: 4, but according to the program's output, it's 2.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the way the program calculates is different, and perhaps I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, maybe the problem defines the steps differently.

Let me check the problem statement again.

"When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the following rules:

- If the pinball is on the i-th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right.

- After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i.e., if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa).

- The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one.

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i-th query, a pinball will be placed on the i-th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps."

So, the steps are counted as seconds, with one move per second.

In my simulation for n=4, s="<<<<", starting at position 2:

1. Move from 2 to 1, s[2] becomes '>', s="><<<<" (n=4, so s="><<<")

2. Move from 1 to 2, s[1] becomes '<', s="><<<"

3. Move from 2 to 1, s[2] becomes '<', s="<< <"

4. Move from 1 to 0 (out of grid), s[1] becomes '>', s=">><<"

Total steps: 4

But according to the program's output, it's 2 for position 2.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the program is considering only the steps until the pinball changes direction or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem's indexing or movement rules.

Let me try to simulate again carefully.

Starting at position 2 (1-based indexing):

- s="<<<<"

- Step 1: s[2]='<', move left to position 1, then flip s[2] to '>', s="><<<"

- Step 2: s[1]='<', move left to position 0, exit the grid, flip s[1] to '>', s=">><<"

- Total steps: 2

Ah, I see! In this simulation, after moving from position 2 to 1, and flipping s[2] to '>', then at position 1, s[1]='<', move left to position 0 and exit, flipping s[1] to '>', total steps: 2.

So, my earlier simulation was incorrect because I mistakenly considered s[1] as '>' after the first flip, but actually, s[1] was still '<' when the pinball was at position 1.

Therefore, the correct number of steps for position 2 is indeed 2, matching the program's output.

I must have made a mistake in tracking the grid's state during simulation.

So, the program seems to be correct for this test case.

Let me check another test case to be sure.

Third test case:

n=6, s="<><<<>"

Output: 1 4 7 10 8 1

Let's simulate position 1:

- s="<><<<>"

- At 1, '<', move left out of the grid, flip s[1] to '>', s="><<<<>"

- Total steps: 1

Position 2:

- At 2, '>', move right to 3, flip s[2] to '<', s="<><<<<"

- At 3, '<', move left to 2, flip s[3] to '>', s="<><><<"

- At 2, '<', move left to 1, flip s[2] to '>', s="><><<"

- At 1, '<', move left out of the grid, flip s[1] to '>', s=">><><<"

- Total steps: 4

Position 3:

- At 3, '<', move left to 2, flip s[3] to '>', s="<><><<"

- At 2, '<', move left to 1, flip s[2] to '>', s="><><<"

- At 1, '<', move left out of the grid, flip s[1] to '>', s=">><><<"

- Total steps: 3

But according to the output, position 3 should be 7.

Wait, perhaps my simulation is again incorrect.

Let me try again:

Position 3:

- s="<><<<>"

- Step 1: at 3, '<', move left to 2, flip s[3] to '>', s="<><><>"

- Step 2: at 2, '<', move left to 1, flip s[2] to '>', s="><><>"

- Step 3: at 1, '<', move left out of the grid, flip s[1] to '>', s=">><><>"

- Total steps: 3

But the output is 7, which doesn't match.

This suggests that either the program is incorrect or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the flipping affects future moves in a way that leads to more steps.

Let me think differently.

Maybe each time the pinball passes over a cell, it flips the arrow, which could potentially create a loop or extend the path.

But in the above simulation, it seems to exit in 3 steps, but the output is 7.

This discrepancy suggests that the program might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more complex interaction that I'm not accounting for.

Given this inconsistency, I'm starting to doubt the correctness of the provided program.

Let me check another position to see if the pattern holds.

Position 4:

- s="<><<<>"

- Step 1: at 4, '<', move left to 3, flip s[4] to '>', s="<><><>"

- Step 2: at 3, '<', move left to 2, flip s[3] to '>', s="<><>><"

- Step 3: at 2, '<', move left to 1, flip s[2] to '>', s="><>><"

- Step 4: at 1, '<', move left out of the grid, flip s[1] to '>', s=">><>><"

- Total steps: 4

But according to the output, it should be 10.

This further suggests that the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is considering something else, like the total number of flips or something, but the output is supposed to be the number of seconds until the pinball exits the grid.

Given these mismatches between my simulations and the program's output, I'm inclined to say that the program is incorrect.

However, perhaps there's a flaw in my understanding or simulation.

Let me consider that each time the pinball moves, it flips the arrow in the cell it just left, which could affect future moves if it passes through that cell again.

But in the above simulations, it seems that the pinball exits before such interactions become complex.

Given that, I still think the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
