Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, where m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every subsegment of array a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for the elements to match after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of their positions. But actually, it's a bit more specific because it says "match the elements of array b." So, perhaps it means that at least k elements in the subsegment of a are equal to the corresponding elements in b after some rearrangement.

Wait, let's look back at the example. It says that for b = [1,2,3,4] and k=3, the array [4,1,2,3] is good because it can be reordered to [1,2,3,4], which matches b in all positions. Another example is [2,3,4,5], which can be reordered to [5,2,3,4], where the last three numbers match b's last three numbers, assuming b is [1,2,3,4]. So, it seems like we need at least k elements in the subsegment of a to be equal to k elements in b, regardless of order.

So, in other words, we need to check for every subsegment of a of length m, if there are at least k elements that are present in b.

But, I need to be careful because b might have duplicate elements. So, I need to consider the frequency of each element in b.

Let me think about how to approach this efficiently, especially since n and m can be up to 2*10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

So, it's important to have an efficient solution per test case.

One way to approach this is to use a sliding window over array a with size m and keep track of how many elements in the current window are also in b, considering the frequencies.

To do this, I can maintain a frequency count of elements in b and then, as I slide the window over a, keep track of how many elements in the window are in b with frequency greater than zero.

Wait, but frequencies are important because b might have duplicates.

For example, if b has two 3's, then in the subsegment of a, I need at least two 3's to count both of them towards k.

So, I need to keep track of the frequency of each element in b and ensure that in the subsegment of a, the frequency of each element matches or exceeds the frequency in b, up to k matches.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved using a sliding window with a frequency counter.

Let me think about the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n, m, k

b. Read array a of size n

c. Read array b of size m

2. For array b, count the frequency of each element.

3. Initialize a frequency counter for the current window in a.

4. Slide the window over a from left to right:

a. For each new element entering the window, update its frequency in the counter.

b. For each element leaving the window, decrease its frequency in the counter.

c. Check if the current window has at least k elements that match b's elements, considering frequencies.

5. Count how many such windows satisfy the condition.

Now, the key part is step 4c: checking if the window has at least k matches with b.

To efficiently check this, I can keep track of how many elements in the window match b's elements, considering their frequencies.

I can maintain a counter for the window and compare it with b's frequency counter.

But comparing two frequency counters for each window might be too slow if done naively, especially since t can be up to 10^4.

So, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Precompute the frequency of each element in b.

- As I slide the window over a, keep track of how many elements in the window match b's elements, considering their frequencies.

- To do this, maintain a frequency counter for the current window.

- Keep a count of how many elements in the window match b's elements, considering their frequencies.

- When sliding the window, update this count by considering the element that is leaving the window and the element that is entering the window.

This seems feasible.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define:

- freq_b: frequency counter for array b.

- freq_window: frequency counter for the current window in a.

- matches: number of elements in the window that match b's elements, considering frequencies.

Initialize freq_window and matches for the first window.

Then, for each subsequent window, when sliding from position i to i+1:

- Remove a[i-1] from freq_window: decrement its frequency in freq_window.

- If freq_window[a[i-1]] is less than or equal to freq_b[a[i-1]], then matches might need to be decreased.

- Add a[i+m-1] to freq_window: increment its frequency in freq_window.

- If freq_window[a[i+m-1]] is less than or equal to freq_b[a[i+m-1]], then matches might need to be increased.

Then, check if matches >= k, and if so, increment the answer counter.

Wait, but this might not be entirely accurate because an element in the window could have a frequency higher than in b, but we only count up to freq_b[a[j]] for each a[j].

So, perhaps I need to count for each element in the window how many times it matches b's frequency, up to freq_b[a[j]].

This sounds a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I keep track of the sum over all elements in the window of the minimum of their frequencies in the window and in b.

So, matches = sum(min(freq_window[x], freq_b[x])) for all x.

Then, if matches >= k, the window is good.

But calculating this sum for each window is too slow if done directly, since n can be up to 2e5.

So, I need a way to maintain this sum efficiently as I slide the window.

Let me consider that when I slide the window from position i to i+1, I remove a[i-1] and add a[i+m-1].

So, the change in matches is:

- If a[i-1] is in b:

- If freq_window[a[i-1]] <= freq_b[a[i-1]], then matches decreases by 1.

- Else, matches stays the same.

- If a[i+m-1] is in b:

- If freq_window[a[i+m-1]] < freq_b[a[i+m-1]], then matches increases by 1.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize it.

Initialize freq_window as a frequency counter for the first window a[0] to a[m-1].

Compute matches as sum(min(freq_window[x], freq_b[x])) for all x.

If matches >= k, increment answer.

Then, for each i from 1 to n-m+1:

- Remove a[i-1] from freq_window:

- If a[i-1] is in b:

- If freq_window[a[i-1]] <= freq_b[a[i-1]], then matches -= 1

- freq_window[a[i-1]] -= 1

- If freq_window[a[i-1]] == 0, remove it from freq_window

- Add a[i+m-1] to freq_window:

- If a[i+m-1] is in b:

- freq_window[a[i+m-1]] += 1

- If freq_window[a[i+m-1]] <= freq_b[a[i+m-1]], then matches += 1

- If matches >= k, increment answer.

This should work efficiently because we're only updating matches based on the elements entering and leaving the window.

I need to make sure that freq_window only keeps track of elements that are in b, to optimize space and time.

Also, since a and b can have elements up to 1e6, I need to handle frequency counters efficiently, perhaps using dictionaries.

But using dictionaries with up to 1e6 unique elements might be slow, so maybe I can optimize by only considering elements that are in b.

Wait, in the problem, elements in a and b are between 1 and 1e6, so I can use lists with indices up to 1e6.

But with t up to 1e4, and sum of n over t up to 2e5, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient per test case.

I think this approach should work.

Let me think about potential edge cases:

- k = 1: even if m is large, only one match is required.

- k = m: all elements in the window must match b's elements.

- b has duplicate elements: need to handle frequencies correctly.

- a has more duplicates than b: need to ensure that we don't count more matches than the frequency in b.

- Windows where elements enter and leave the window, potentially affecting matches.

I should also consider the constraints on time and space.

Given that n and m can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but sum of n over t is up to 2e5, I need to make sure that my per-test-case time is O(n).

In the solution above, per test case time is O(n + m), which should be acceptable.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

max_val = 1000000

cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(m):

cnt_b[b[i]] += 1

b_values = set(b)

ans = 0

curr = 0

for i in range(m):

if a[i] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1

if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:

curr += 1

if curr >= k:

ans += 1

for i in range(n - m):

if a[i] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i]] += 1

if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:

curr -= 1

if a[i + m] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1

if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:

curr += 1

if curr >= k:

ans += 1

print(ans)

for i in b_values:

cnt_b[i] = 0

So, it seems to be implementing a sliding window approach.

Let's verify if it correctly handles the matching logic.

It initializes cnt_b as a list of size max_val + 1, initialized to 0.

Then, for each test case:

- Reads n, m, k

- Reads array a of size n

- Reads array b of size m

- Counts frequency of each element in b using cnt_b

- Creates a set b_values containing unique elements of b

- Initializes ans (answer counter) to 0

- Initializes curr (current matches) to 0

- For the first window of size m:

- For each element in the first window of a:

- If a[i] is in b_values:

- Decrement cnt_b[a[i]]

- If cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0, increment curr

- If curr >= k, increment ans

- Then, for each subsequent window (from i = 0 to n - m - 1):

- If a[i] is in b_values:

- Increment cnt_b[a[i]]

- If cnt_b[a[i]] > 0, decrement curr

- If a[i + m] is in b_values:

- Decrement cnt_b[a[i + m]]

- If cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0, increment curr

- If curr >= k, increment ans

- After processing all windows, print ans

- Reset cnt_b for the next test case by setting cnt_b[i] = 0 for each i in b_values

This seems correct.

Let's verify the logic:

- cnt_b initially counts the frequency of each element in b.

- For the first window, for each element in a[0..m-1], if it's in b_values:

- Decrement cnt_b[a[i]]

- If cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0, it means that this element was present in b with frequency > 0, so increment curr

- This effectively counts how many elements in the first window match b's elements, considering frequencies.

- Then, for each subsequent window, when sliding from i to i+1:

- If a[i] is in b_values:

- Increment cnt_b[a[i]] (since it's leaving the window)

- If cnt_b[a[i]] > 0, it means that this element was part of the matches, so decrement curr

- If a[i + m] is in b_values:

- Decrement cnt_b[a[i + m]] (since it's entering the window)

- If cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0, it means that this element is present in b with remaining frequency > 0, so increment curr

- If curr >= k, increment ans

- This seems to correctly maintain the count of matches as the window slides.

Also, after processing each test case, it resets cnt_b for the elements in b_values to 0, which is necessary for the next test case.

I think this implementation correctly handles the problem as per the sliding window approach I described earlier.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
