Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, where m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every subsegment of array a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for the elements to match after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are present in b, regardless of their positions. But actually, it's a bit more specific because it says "match the elements of array b." So, perhaps it means that at least k elements in the subsegment are equal to the corresponding elements in b after some rearrangement.

Wait, let's look back at the example. For b = [1,2,3,4] and k=3, the array [2,3,4,5] is considered good because it can be reordered to [5,2,3,4], which has three matching elements (2,3,4). So, it's not about matching positions, just that at least k elements are present in b, possibly in a different order.

So, the task is to count the number of subsegments of a of length m where, after rearranging the elements, at least k of them are equal to elements in b.

I need to process multiple test cases, and for each test case, output the number of such good subsegments.

Constraints are that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, same for m. So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to slide a window of size m over array a and, for each window, count how many elements are present in b. If this count is at least k, then the subsegment is good.

But waiting, I need to be careful because b may have duplicate elements. So, I need to consider the frequency of each element in b.

For example, if b has two 3's, then in the subsegment of a, I need to have at least two 3's to match them.

So, I need to keep track of the frequency of elements in b and ensure that the subsegment of a has at least the required frequency for each element in b.

But actually, the problem says "elements of array c can be rearranged such that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, perhaps it's sufficient to have at least k elements in common between the subsegment and b, regardless of their frequencies.

Wait, but considering frequencies might be necessary to accurately count.

Let me think differently. Suppose I create a frequency map for b, and then for each window of size m in a, I create a frequency map for that window and count how many elements are common, considering their frequencies.

But that might be too slow if done naively.

I need a sliding window approach where I can efficiently keep track of how many elements in the current window match elements in b, considering their frequencies.

Let me consider using a counter for b and then, as I slide the window in a, keep a counter for the current window and count the number of matching elements based on their frequencies.

But maintaining two counters and comparing them for each window might be too slow for the given constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can optimize it by using the sliding window technique and updating counts as I move the window.

Let me think about it step by step.

First, for each test case:

1. Read n, m, k.

2. Read array a of n integers.

3. Read array b of m integers.

I need to consider every subsegment of a of length m and check if, after rearrangement, at least k elements match those in b.

Given that b has m elements and the subsegment also has m elements, and m <= n.

I need an efficient way to count, for each window, how many elements are present in b, considering their frequencies.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let freq_b be the frequency map of array b.

For each window of size m in a, let freq_window be the frequency map of that window.

I need to count, for each element x, the minimum of freq_window[x] and freq_b[x], and sum these up. If this sum is at least k, then the window is good.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, for each window, calculate the intersection of freq_window and freq_b, and check if the sum of the minimum frequencies is at least k.

If yes, then it's a good window.

Now, the challenge is to compute this efficiently.

Given the constraints, I need a O(n) per test case solution.

Let me consider using a sliding window and keeping track of the frequency counts.

Initialize freq_b by counting frequencies in b.

Then, for the first window of size m in a, count freq_window.

Calculate the intersection sum by summing min(freq_window[x], freq_b[x]) for all x.

If this sum is >= k, increment the answer.

Then, as I slide the window by one position, I remove the element that is no longer in the window and add the new element, updating freq_window accordingly.

Adjust the intersection sum based on the changes in freq_window.

If the new intersection sum is >= k, increment the answer.

Repeat until all windows are processed.

This seems feasible.

Now, considering that elements can be up to 10^6, I need to handle frequency maps efficiently.

In Python, using dictionaries for frequency counts is straightforward.

But with n and m up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, but sum of n and m over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, it should be manageable.

But I need to make sure that the solution is optimized and doesn't have unnecessary operations inside loops.

Let me think about the implementation details.

For each test case:

- Read n, m, k.

- Read array a.

- Read array b and compute freq_b.

- Initialize freq_window for the first window of size m in a.

- Compute the initial intersection sum.

- If intersection sum >= k, increment answer.

- Then, slide the window from position 1 to n-m:

- Remove the element that is outgoing from the window.

- Add the new incoming element.

- Update freq_window and intersection sum accordingly.

- If intersection sum >= k, increment answer.

- Output the answer.

Now, to optimize, I need to update the intersection sum efficiently when the window slides.

When removing an element that is in b:

- If freq_window[x] > freq_b[x], then the intersection sum remains the same.

- Else, intersection sum decreases by 1.

When adding an element that is in b:

- If freq_window[x] < freq_b[x], then intersection sum increases by 1.

Need to handle these cases carefully.

Let me try to implement this logic.

I'll need to keep track of the current intersection sum.

Initialize it for the first window.

Then, for each slide:

- Remove the outgoing element:

- If it's in b:

- If freq_window[x] <= freq_b[x], then intersection sum decreases by 1.

- Update freq_window[x] -=1.

- If it reaches 0, remove it from the frequency map.

- Add the incoming element:

- If it's in b:

- If freq_window[x] < freq_b[x], then intersection sum increases by 1.

- Update freq_window[x] +=1.

- If freq_window[x] == freq_b[x], then intersection sum increases by 1.

Wait, I need to be careful here.

Actually, the intersection sum is the sum of min(freq_window[x], freq_b[x]) for all x.

When removing an outgoing element x:

- If freq_window[x] > freq_b[x], then intersection sum remains the same.

- Else, intersection sum decreases by 1.

When adding an incoming element x:

- If freq_window[x] < freq_b[x], then intersection sum increases by 1.

- Else, intersection sum remains the same.

Wait, but freq_window[x] could be greater than freq_b[x], but in that case, the min is freq_b[x], so no additional increase in intersection sum.

So, the rules are:

- When removing an outgoing element x:

- If freq_window[x] <= freq_b[x], then intersection sum decreases by 1.

- When adding an incoming element x:

- If freq_window[x] < freq_b[x], then intersection sum increases by 1.

Yes, that seems correct.

Let me test this logic with an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

freq_b = {1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1}

First window: [4,1,2,3]

freq_window = {4:1,1:1,2:1,3:1}

intersection sum = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 4 >=2, so good.

Second window: [1,2,3,4]

freq_window = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

intersection sum = 4 >=2, good.

Third window: [2,3,4,5]

freq_window = {2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

intersection sum = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) = 3 >=2, good.

Fourth window: [3,4,5,6]

freq_window = {3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}

intersection sum = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) = 2 >=2, good.

So, total good subsegments: 4, which matches the first output.

Good, seems correct.

Let's check the second test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

freq_b = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

First window: [4,1,2,3]

freq_window = {4:1,1:1,2:1,3:1}

intersection sum = 4 >=3, good.

Second window: [1,2,3,4]

freq_window = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

intersection sum = 4 >=3, good.

Third window: [2,3,4,5]

freq_window = {2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

intersection sum = 3 >=3, good.

Fourth window: [3,4,5,6]

freq_window = {3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}

intersection sum = 2 <3, not good.

Total good subsegments: 3, matches the second output.

Great, seems correct.

Now, for implementation, I need to handle frequency maps efficiently.

In Python, using dictionaries with default values can be handy.

I can use collections.Counter for freq_b.

For freq_window, I can use a standard dict.

Also, to handle elements up to 10^6, I need to ensure that the frequency maps can handle that.

But since I'm using dicts, it's fine.

I need to make sure that the code is optimized and doesn't have unnecessary operations inside loops.

Given that sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, and same for m, I need to keep the per-test-case time complexity to O(n).

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

max_val = 1000000

cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(m):

cnt_b[b[i]] += 1

b_values = set(b)

ans = 0

curr = 0

for i in range(m):

if a[i] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1

if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:

curr += 1

if curr >= k:

ans += 1

for i in range(n - m):

if a[i] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i]] += 1

if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:

curr -= 1

if a[i + m] in b_values:

cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1

if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:

curr += 1

if curr >= k:

ans += 1

print(ans)

for i in b_values:

cnt_b[i] = 0

So, the code uses a list cnt_b of size max_val+1 to keep track of the frequencies of elements in b.

It reads t test cases, and for each test case:

- Reads n, m, k.

- Reads array a.

- Reads array b and counts frequencies in cnt_b.

- Creates a set b_values containing the unique elements in b.

- Initializes ans (answer) to 0 and curr (current intersection sum) to 0.

- Processes the first window of size m:

- For each element in the first window, if it's in b_values, decrements cnt_b[a[i]] and if cnt_b[a[i]] >=0, increments curr.

- If curr >=k, increments ans.

- Then, slides the window from position 1 to n-m:

- For each slide, if the outgoing element is in b_values, increments cnt_b[a[i]] and if cnt_b[a[i]] >0, decrements curr.

- If the incoming element is in b_values, decrements cnt_b[a[i+m]] and if cnt_b[a[i+m]] >=0, increments curr.

- If curr >=k, increments ans.

- Prints ans.

- Resets cnt_b for elements in b_values to 0 for the next test case.

This seems to implement the sliding window approach with frequency tracking.

Let's verify if it correctly handles the frequency counts.

In the initial window, for each element in the window that is in b_values, it decrements cnt_b[a[i]] and if cnt_b[a[i]] >=0, increments curr.

This seems to be counting how many elements in the window are present in b, considering their frequencies.

Wait, cnt_b initially has the frequencies of elements in b.

When an element from the window is in b_values, it decrements cnt_b[a[i]].

If cnt_b[a[i]] >=0 after decrementing, it means that the frequency in the window so far doesn't exceed the frequency in b, so it's a matching element.

Hence, curr counts the number of matching elements, considering their frequencies.

Then, when sliding the window, it adjusts curr based on the outgoing and incoming elements.

This seems correct.

In the sliding window step:

- For the outgoing element a[i]:

- If it's in b_values, increment cnt_b[a[i]].

- If cnt_b[a[i]] >0, decrement curr.

This makes sense because we're removing one occurrence of a[i] from the window.

If cnt_b[a[i]] >0 after incrementing, it means that before incrementing, it was >=0, so we need to decrement curr.

- For the incoming element a[i+m]:

- If it's in b_values, decrement cnt_b[a[i+m]].

- If cnt_b[a[i+m]] >=0, increment curr.

Similar logic as in the initial window.

Finally, if curr >=k, increment ans.

After all windows are processed, print ans.

And then, for the next test case, reset cnt_b for elements in b_values to 0.

Wait, but in the next test case, cnt_b should be reset for the new b.

But in the code, it resets cnt_b[i] to 0 for i in b_values.

But b_values is a set of unique elements in b for the current test case.

So, it's resetting cnt_b for those elements.

But in the next test case, b might have different elements, so this might not be sufficient.

Wait, actually, cnt_b is a list of size max_val+1, initialized once at the beginning.

But in each test case, it accumulates frequencies from b.

Then, in the sliding window, it decrements for elements in the window.

Then, after processing a test case, it resets cnt_b for the elements in b_values to 0.

But in the next test case, if the same elements are in b, it's fine.

But if different elements are in b, cnt_b for those elements might have been modified in previous test cases, so resetting only b_values might not be enough.

Wait, but in each test case, cnt_b is supposed to represent the frequency of elements in b for that test case.

So, perhaps it's better to reset cnt_b to 0 for all elements between test cases to avoid interference.

But in the code, it only resets cnt_b for the elements in b_values.

This might lead to incorrect counts if the same element is present in multiple test cases.

Wait, but in the first test case, cnt_b for elements in b is incremented by their frequencies.

Then, in the sliding window, cnt_b is decremented for elements in the window.

After processing the test case, cnt_b is reset to 0 for elements in b_values.

So, for the next test case, cnt_b starts with zeros for those elements.

But if a element was in a previous b_values and is not in the current b, its cnt_b might not be zero, which could affect the current test case.

Wait, no, because in each test case, cnt_b is incremented by the frequencies in the current b.

Then, in the sliding window, it's decremented by the elements in the window.

At the end of the test case, cnt_b is reset to 0 for elements in b_values.

So, for the next test case, cnt_b is initialized to 0 for the previous b_values, and then incremented by the frequencies in the new b.

So, it should be correct, as cnt_b always represents the frequencies of the current b minus the frequencies of the current window.

Hence, the logic seems correct.

I think the provided program correctly implements the sliding window approach with frequency tracking to count the number of good subsegments.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correct}} \]
