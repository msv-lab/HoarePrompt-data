Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the list a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on day i, then from day i+1 onwards, the price per ticket increases by x.

My goal is to buy exactly k tickets at the minimum total cost.

First, I need to understand the problem deeply. Let's consider a simple example to grasp what's happening.

Suppose n=3, m=2, k=3, and a=[1, 2, 3].

If I buy 2 tickets on day 1, the cost is 2*1 = 2. Then, from day 2 onwards, the price increases by 2, so a2 becomes 2+2=4, and a3 becomes 3+2=5.

Then, on day 2, I can buy up to 2 tickets at 4 each, but I only need 1 more ticket since I've already bought 2. So, I buy 1 ticket for 4, totaling 2 + 4 = 6.

Alternatively, if I buy 1 ticket on day 1, costing 1, then the prices from day 2 onwards increase by 1, so a2=3, a3=4.

On day 2, buy 1 ticket for 3, now a3 increases by 1 to 4+1=5.

On day 3, buy 1 ticket for 5.

Total cost: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is higher than 6.

So, buying more tickets earlier seems beneficial when the initial prices are lower.

Wait, but in the first approach, buying 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2 costed 6, whereas buying 1 each day costed 9. So, buying in bulk earlier is better.

But is this always the case? Let's try another scenario.

Suppose n=2, m=1, k=2, a=[1, 100].

If I buy 1 ticket on day 1 for 1, then day 2 price becomes 100 +1=101.

Buy 1 ticket on day 2 for 101, total 1+101=102.

Alternatively, buy 0 on day 1, prices on day 2 are 100.

Buy 1 on day 2 for 100, then prices for day 3 (if exists) would increase, but since n=2, that's it.

Wait, but k=2, so I need to buy another ticket.

Oh, but n=2, m=1, k=2.

So, buy 1 on day 1 for 1, day 2 price becomes 100 +1=101, buy 1 on day 2 for 101, total 102.

Alternatively, buy 0 on day 1, day 2 price is 100, buy 1 for 100, but then still need to buy another ticket.

But n=2, m=1, so can't buy more than 1 per day.

Wait, in this case, the total would still be 100 + 100=200, which is worse than 102.

Wait, no, if I buy 0 on day 1, day 2 price is 100, buy 1 for 100, then since k=2, need to buy another ticket.

But m=1, so on day 2, I can only buy 1 ticket for 100, and then I need to buy another ticket on day 2, but m=1, so I can't.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the constraints.

Let me read the problem again.

" A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day.

If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . "

So, in the second scenario, if I buy 0 on day 1, day 2 price becomes 100 +0=100, then buy 1 on day 2 for 100.

But I still need to buy another ticket, but n=2, m=1, so I can't buy more than 1 on day 2.

Wait, k=2, but I can only buy 1 on day 1 and 1 on day 2, total 2.

So, total cost is 1 + (100 +1)=101, which is less than buying 0 on day 1 and 1 on day 2 for 100, and then needing another ticket.

Wait, but n=2, m=1, k=2, a=[1,100].

Option 1:

Buy 1 on day 1 for 1, day 2 price becomes 100 +1=101, buy 1 on day 2 for 101, total 102.

Option 2:

Buy 0 on day 1, day 2 price is 100 +0=100, buy 1 on day 2 for 100, but then still need to buy another ticket.

But n=2, m=1, so can't buy more than 1 on day 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that I have to buy within n days, and m tickets per day.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me think about the general case.

I need to buy k tickets, with daily limits of m tickets, and each ticket bought on day i increases the price for future days.

I need to minimize the total cost.

This sounds like a problem that can be approached with greedy algorithms, where I try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest initial prices, considering the impact on future prices.

But the twist is that buying tickets on earlier days increases the prices for later days.

So, there's a trade-off between buying cheap tickets early and avoiding inflating the prices for future tickets.

I need to find the optimal balance.

Let me consider sorting the days by their initial prices, a_i.

If I sort the days in ascending order of a_i, then I can consider buying tickets on the cheapest days first, but I have to account for the fact that buying tickets on earlier days in the sorted list will increase the prices for later days.

Wait, but the days are ordered, and the price increases are carried forward.

So, perhaps sorting isn't directly applicable.

Wait, maybe I can think of it differently.

Let me consider that each ticket I buy on day i costs a_i plus the sum of x for all previous days where x tickets were bought.

Wait, more formally, the price per ticket on day j is a_j plus the sum of x_i for all i < j.

Because each x_i bought on day i increases the price for day j by x_i for all j > i.

So, the total cost for buying x_j tickets on day j is x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i).

Given this, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i).

Subject to:

- sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j = k

- x_j <= m for all j

This seems like a minimization problem with constraints.

This looks similar to minimizing a quadratic function with linear constraints.

This might be approachable with dynamic programming or some mathematical optimization.

But considering the constraints, n can be up to 3e5, and k up to 1e9, so any solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n log n) at worst.

Let me think about a greedy approach.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, considering the constraints on m and the increasing prices for future days.

But I need to account for the fact that buying on a day with lower a_i might inflate the prices for higher a_i days, which might not be desirable.

Wait, perhaps I need to prioritize buying on days with lower a_i plus the accumulated sum of x_i.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as:

sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i) = sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_j * a_j) + sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i)

Let me denote s_j = sum_{i=1}^{j} x_i

Then, sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1}

Note that s_j is increasing, and s_n = k.

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe I can find a way to minimize this expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the dual problem or use some kind of priority queue to manage the days.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of assigning the tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the increasing prices.

Let me consider that each ticket has an associated cost based on the day it's bought and the cumulative effect on future prices.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think of a small example and see if I can find a pattern.

Take n=3, m=2, k=3, a=[1,2,3].

Option 1:

Buy 2 on day 1 for 2*1=2, then day 2 and 3 prices increase by 2.

So day 2: 2+2=4, day 3:3+2=5.

Then buy 1 on day 2 for 4, total cost 2+4=6.

Option 2:

Buy 1 on day 1 for 1, day 2 and 3 prices increase by 1.

Then buy 1 on day 2 for 2+1=3, day 3 price becomes 3+1=4.

Then buy 1 on day 3 for 4, total cost 1+3+4=8.

Option 3:

Buy 0 on day 1, day 2 and 3 prices unchanged.

Buy 2 on day 2 for 2*2=4, day 3 price increases by 2 to 3+2=5.

Buy 1 on day 3 for 5, total cost 4+5=9.

Option 4:

Buy 1 on day 1 for 1, day 2 and 3 prices increase by 1.

Buy 0 on day 2, day 3 price is 3+1=4.

Buy 2 on day 3 for 2*4=8, total cost 1+8=9.

So, the first option is the best.

Another example: n=4, m=2, k=3, a=[8,6,4,2].

From the sample input, the output is 10.

In the explanation, they buy 1 on day 3 for 4, and 2 on day 4 for 6, total 10.

Another option: buy 2 on day 1 for 16, then day 2,3,4 prices increase by 2.

Day 2:6+2=8, day 3:4+2=6, day 4:2+2=4.

Then buy 1 on day 4 for 4, total 16+4=20, which is worse.

Another option: buy 1 on day 1 for 8, prices increase by 1 for future days.

Day 2:6+1=7, day 3:4+1=5, day 4:2+1=3.

Buy 1 on day 2 for 7, day 3 and 4 prices increase to 5+1=6 and 3+1=4.

Buy 1 on day 3 for 6, total 8+7+6=21, which is worse.

So, the first approach in the sample is better.

Seems like buying later is better in this case because the initial prices are higher.

Wait, but in the first example, buying earlier was better.

This is confusing.

Wait, in the first example with a=[1,2,3], buying early was better, while in a=[8,6,4,2], buying later was better.

So, perhaps I should buy on the days with the lowest a_i + the accumulated sum of x_i.

Wait, but in the first example, a_i are increasing, and in the second, they are decreasing.

So, perhaps the strategy depends on the sorted order of a_i.

Wait, maybe I should sort the days by a_i and decide how many tickets to buy on each sorted day.

Let me consider sorting the days by a_i in ascending order.

Then, assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_i, considering the constraints.

But I need to account for the price increases for future days.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the total cost if I buy a certain number of tickets on each day, considering the price increases.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about the total cost formula again.

Total cost = sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i)

Let me denote s_j = sum_{i=1}^{j} x_i

Then, sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + s_j - x_j)

= sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_j * a_j + x_j * s_j - x_j^2)

But s_j = s_{j-1} + x_j

Wait, maybe I can rearrange this.

This seems too convoluted.

Perhaps I need to approach this differently.

Let me consider that each ticket bought on day j contributes a_j plus the sum of x_i for i < j to the total cost.

So, the cost of each ticket on day j is a_j plus the number of tickets bought on previous days.

Therefore, the cost of the p-th ticket bought on day j is a_j plus p minus 1, because each previous ticket increases the price by 1.

Wait, no.

Actually, each ticket bought on any previous day increases the price by 1 for all future days.

So, if I have s_{j-1} tickets bought on days 1 to j-1, then each ticket bought on day j costs a_j + s_{j-1}.

Wait, that seems right.

So, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1})

Where s_j = sum_{i=1}^{j} x_i

So, s_0 = 0, s_1 = x_1, s_2 = x_1 + x_2, etc.

Therefore, total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1})

Our goal is to minimize this sum, subject to sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j = k and x_j <= m for all j.

This looks like a linear function in terms of x_j, but with interactions between them through s_{j-1}.

Let me see if I can rearrange this.

sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1}

But s_{j-1} = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

So, sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

This seems quadratic in x_j.

This is getting messy.

Maybe I can think of it as assigning tickets to days, where each assigned ticket on day j has a cost of a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to previous days.

So, the first ticket assigned to any day has cost a_j, the second has a_j +1, the third a_j +2, and so on.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Actually, each ticket bought on day j has a cost of a_j plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I buy x_j tickets on day j, their costs are a_j + s_{j-1}, a_j + s_{j-1} +1, ..., a_j + s_{j-1} + x_j -1.

Wait, no.

Because each ticket bought on any previous day increases the price by 1 for all future days.

So, the price per ticket on day j is a_j plus s_{j-1}.

Then, buying x_j tickets on day j would cost x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1}).

Yes, that seems correct.

So, total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1})

Our aim is to minimize this sum, given that sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j = k and x_j <= m for all j.

Now, to minimize the total cost, I need to minimize sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1}

But s_{j-1} = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1} = sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i * sum_{j=i+1}^{n} x_j

Wait, that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as assigning k tickets to the n days, with each day having a capacity of m tickets, and each ticket assigned to day j having a cost of a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to previous days.

So, the cost of the p-th ticket assigned to day j is a_j plus the total number of tickets assigned to days 1 through j-1.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days by a_j and assign tickets accordingly.

Wait, maybe I should consider the days in order of increasing a_j.

Let me sort the days in ascending order of a_j.

Then, assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_j, considering the constraints.

But I need to be careful because assigning tickets to earlier days in the sorted list will increase the prices for later days.

Wait, but the days are sorted by a_j, which might not correspond to their original order.

Wait, no, I need to sort the days by a_j, but keep track of their original positions.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x_j, subject to sum x_j = k and x_j <= m.

Then, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i)

I need to minimize this.

This seems like a minimization of a quadratic function with linear constraints.

This might be approachable with dynamic programming.

Let me consider dp[j][s] = minimum cost to buy s tickets using the first j days.

Then, dp[j][s] = min_{x_j} { dp[j-1][s - x_j] + x_j * (a_j + s - x_j) }, where x_j <= m and s - x_j >=0.

But this is O(n*k), which is too slow since k can be up to 1e9.

I need a better approach.

Perhaps I can find a mathematical formula or a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1}

= sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

= sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i * sum_{j=i+1}^{n} x_j

This seems like sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i * (k - s_i)

Wait, no.

Wait, sum_{j=i+1}^{n} x_j = k - s_i, where s_i = sum_{j=1}^{i} x_j.

So, sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1} = sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1}

But s_{j-1} = s_{j-1}, which is the sum of x_i for i from 1 to j-1.

So, sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1} = sum_{j=2}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1}

But this is still not helpful.

Maybe I need to consider the derivative of the cost function with respect to x_j.

But that might not be straightforward.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the sequence of x_j, and I want to see how the total cost changes.

If I were to shift one ticket from a day with higher a_j to a day with lower a_j, considering the price increases, would that lead to a lower total cost?

Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the marginal cost of buying an additional ticket on a certain day.

The marginal cost of buying one more ticket on day j is a_j plus the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I sort the marginal costs and assign tickets accordingly.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some optimization problems, we can use priority queues or sorting to assign resources efficiently.

Perhaps I can sort the days by their a_j in ascending order and try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the constraints.

Wait, but the days are ordered, and changing the order might not be directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the days in sorted order and calculate the optimal number of tickets to buy on each.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days by a_j and then assign tickets accordingly.

Let me try that.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_j.

Then, I can consider buying tickets on the days with the lowest a_j first, but considering the impact on future prices.

Wait, but the days are ordered, and I need to respect that.

Maybe I need to consider dynamic programming with some optimization.

Let me consider dp[j][s] = minimum cost to buy s tickets using the first j days.

But with n up to 3e5 and k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1}

= sum x_j * a_j + sum x_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

= sum x_j * a_j + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i * sum_{j=i+1}^{n} x_j

This seems quadratic and hard to minimize directly.

Wait, perhaps I can fix s = sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j = k, and try to minimize the expression.

This seems too abstract.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I decide to buy x_j tickets on day j.

Then, the cost for day j is x_j * (a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i)

Let me denote sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i = s_{j-1}

So, cost_j = x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1})

Our total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} cost_j

Subject to sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j = k and x_j <= m for all j.

I need to minimize sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1})

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the terms.

Let me expand the sum:

sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1}

= sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

= sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * a_j + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i * sum_{j=i+1}^{n} x_j

Still complicated.

Let me consider that sum_{j=i+1}^{n} x_j = k - s_i, where s_i = sum_{j=1}^{i} x_j

So, sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1} = sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * s_{j-1}

But s_{j-1} = s_{j-1}, which is determined by previous x_j.

This seems too recursive.

Maybe I need to consider the problem in terms of assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the increasing prices.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as assigning p tickets to day j, where p can be from 0 to m, and the cost for each ticket is a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to previous days.

So, for day j, if s_{j-1} is the sum of tickets assigned to days 1 to j-1, then the cost for buying x_j tickets on day j is sum_{t=0}^{x_j-1} (a_j + s_{j-1} + t) = x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1}) + x_j * (x_j - 1) / 2

Wait, that makes sense.

Because the first ticket on day j costs a_j + s_{j-1}, the second costs a_j + s_{j-1} +1, and so on, up to a_j + s_{j-1} + x_j -1.

So, the total cost for day j is x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1}) + x_j * (x_j -1) / 2

Therefore, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} [x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1}) + x_j * (x_j -1) / 2]

But s_{j-1} = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i

This is still complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the entire cost function and try to find a way to minimize it.

Let me denote s_j = sum_{i=1}^{j} x_i

Then, s_0 = 0, s_j = s_{j-1} + x_j

So, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} [x_j * a_j + x_j * s_{j-1} + x_j * (x_j -1) / 2]

Which is sum_{j=1}^{n} [x_j * a_j + x_j * s_{j-1} + x_j^2 / 2 - x_j / 2]

This seems too messy.

Maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled as assigning k tickets to n days, with each assignment having a cost based on the day's price and the number of previous tickets assigned.

This sounds like a minimum cost assignment problem, but with a quadratic cost function.

This might be solvable using Lagrange multipliers or some other optimization technique, but that seems too advanced for this context.

Perhaps I can look for a way to reduce this problem to a standard optimization problem with a known solution.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a minimum cost flow problem, where each day is a node, and edges represent assigning tickets to that day, with costs accordingly.

But with n up to 3e5 and k up to 1e9, that might not be efficient enough.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for each day j, the cost of buying x_j tickets is x_j * a_j plus the cost due to previous tickets, which is x_j * s_{j-1}, plus the incremental cost due to buying x_j tickets on day j, which is x_j * (x_j -1) / 2.

So, total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} [x_j * a_j + x_j * s_{j-1} + x_j * (x_j -1) / 2]

This can be rewritten as sum_{j=1}^{n} [x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1}) + x_j^2 / 2 - x_j / 2]

This still seems too complex.

Maybe I can consider that s_{j-1} is fixed when deciding x_j, but it's not, because s_{j-1} depends on previous x_i.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the order of days and decide how many tickets to buy on each day, considering the increasing prices.

I need to minimize the total cost.

Perhaps I can iterate through the days in a certain order and decide the optimal number of tickets to buy each time.

But I need to be careful with the constraints on m and the price increases.

Wait, maybe I can sort the days by their a_j in ascending order and try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the price increases.

But the days are ordered, and sorting them might not preserve the original ordering.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the days by a_j + the accumulated sum of x_i for previous days.

But that's circular, because the sum depends on the x_i.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that the optimal strategy is to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_j, considering the price increases.

So, perhaps I should sort the days by a_j and process them in that order.

Let me try that with the first sample input.

n=4, m=2, k=3, a=[8,6,4,2]

Sort a: [2,4,6,8]

So, day 4 has the lowest a_j, then day 3, day 2, day 1.

Now, I need to assign tickets to these days, starting from the lowest a_j.

But I need to consider the constraints on m and the price increases.

Wait, but the days are ordered, and assigning to day 4 first would mean that the price increases for previous days.

Wait, no, the price increases are forward in time.

Wait, perhaps I need to reverse the days.

Let me consider processing the days in reverse order, from day n to day 1.

So, starting from day n, buy some tickets, then move to day n-1, considering the price increases due to tickets bought on day n, and so on.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use a priority queue to always buy tickets on the day with the current lowest price.

But implementing that might be complex.

Let me consider that for each day, the price per ticket is a_j plus the sum of x_i for i < j.

So, if I sort the days by a_j + sum_{i=1}^{j-1} x_i, and assign as many tickets as possible to the day with the current lowest price, that might lead to the minimal total cost.

But this seems similar to a greedy approach, and it's not clear how to implement it efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the days in order, keeping track of the current price for each day, and always choose to buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price.

But with n up to 3e5, I need an efficient way to find the day with the lowest current price at each step.

This sounds like a job for a priority queue.

I can maintain a priority queue of days, ordered by their current price.

At each step, I select the day with the lowest current price, buy as many tickets as possible on that day, update the prices for the remaining days, and continue until I've bought all k tickets.

But with n up to 3e5 and k up to 1e9, this might be too slow if implemented naively.

I need a way to optimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can group the days by their a_j and calculate how many tickets I can buy at each price level.

Let me think about it.

Suppose I sort the days by a_j in ascending order.

Then, I can consider buying tickets on these days in order, assigning as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_j, considering the constraints on m and the price increases.

Wait, but the price increases are cumulative based on the number of tickets bought on previous days.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1}) + some quadratic terms.

I need to find a way to minimize this expression efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the terms to find a closed-form solution.

Let me try to express the total cost in terms of s_j.

Given that s_j = sum_{i=1}^{j} x_i

Then, s_{j-1} = s_j - x_j

So, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + s_{j-1}) = sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j * (a_j + s_j - x_j)

= sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_j * a_j + x_j * s_j - x_j^2)

This is still not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can think of s_j as a variable and find a way to minimize this expression.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

I recall that in some optimization problems, we can use the concept of minimum cost matching or assigning items to bins with certain costs.

But in this case, the costs are dependent on previous assignments, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can model this problem as assigning k tickets to n days, where each ticket assigned to day j has a cost of a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to previous days.

So, the cost of the p-th ticket assigned to day j is a_j plus the total number of tickets assigned to days before j.

This seems similar to assigning tickets with increasing costs based on previous assignments.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me consider that the total cost is the sum over all tickets of their individual costs, where the cost of each ticket is a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to days before j.

So, if I have t_j tickets assigned to day j, and s_{j-1} tickets assigned to days before j, then the cost for each ticket on day j is a_j + s_{j-1}.

Therefore, the total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} t_j * (a_j + s_{j-1})

Which is the same as sum_{j=1}^{n} t_j * a_j + sum_{j=1}^{n} t_j * s_{j-1}

But s_{j-1} = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} t_i

So, sum_{j=1}^{n} t_j * s_{j-1} = sum_{j=1}^{n} t_j * sum_{i=1}^{j-1} t_i = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} t_i * sum_{j=i+1}^{n} t_j

This seems like a quadratic term in t_j.

This is tricky to minimize directly.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum_{j=1}^{n} t_j * a_j + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} t_i * (k - s_i)

Wait, no, sum_{j=i+1}^{n} t_j = k - s_i

So, sum_{j=1}^{n} t_j * s_{j-1} = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} t_i * (k - s_i)

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the total cost as sum_{j=1}^{n} t_j * a_j + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} t_i * (k - s_i)

But this seems too vague.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal total cost can be achieved by assigning tickets to days in a way that the cost per ticket is minimized, considering the price increases.

So, perhaps I should sort the days by a_j and assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_j, but considering the constraints on m and the price increases.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_j.

Then, I can try to assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_j, up
