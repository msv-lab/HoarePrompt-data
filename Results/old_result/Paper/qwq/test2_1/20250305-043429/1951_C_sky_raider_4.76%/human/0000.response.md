Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the array a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on a particular day, the price per ticket increases by x for all subsequent days.

My goal is to buy exactly k tickets in total, across these n days, spending as little money as possible.

First, I need to understand the problem deeply. Let's break it down.

**Understanding the Problem:**

- There are n days, each with a base price a_i for tickets.

- Each day, I can buy at most m tickets.

- If I buy x tickets on day i, then for all days j > i, the price per ticket increases by x.

So, the price on day j, if I've bought x tickets before day j, is a_j + x.

I need to buy exactly k tickets, choosing how many to buy on each day, respecting the daily limit m, and minimizing the total cost.

**Example Walkthrough:**

Let's look at the first example in the problem:

Input:

4

4 2 3

8 6 4 2

Output:

10

Explanation:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices become [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices become [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost = 4, prices become [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 6

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10

Another way:

- Buy 1 on day 1: cost = 8, prices become [7,5,3]

- Buy 1 on day 2: cost = 7, prices become [6,4]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost = 6

Total cost = 8 + 7 + 6 = 21, which is worse.

So, buying later when prices are lower is better, but I have to consider the price increases due to previous purchases.

**Approach:**

I need a strategy to minimize the total cost. Since buying tickets on a day increases the prices for subsequent days, I should aim to buy tickets on days when the base price is low, but also consider that buying too many tickets early might increase the prices for later days too much.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, but with n up to 3e5, DP might be too slow. Maybe there's a greedy approach.

**Greedy Idea:**

What if I always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price? But since the price increases over time due to previous purchases, I need to consider the base price plus the increases due to previous purchases.

Wait, perhaps I should sort the days by their base price in ascending order and buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days first.

But I have to consider the daily purchase limits and the fact that buying on a day affects future prices.

Let me think differently. Suppose I fix the number of tickets I buy on each day, say x1 on day1, x2 on day2, ..., xn on dayn, with sum(xi) = k and xi <= m for all i.

The total cost would be:

sum over i from 1 to n of xi * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of xj)

This is because each ticket bought on day i pays the base price a_i plus the increase due to all previous purchases.

This can be rewritten as:

sum over i from 1 to n of (xi * a_i + xi * sum_{j=1 to i-1} xj)

= sum over i from 1 to n of (xi * a_i) + sum over i from 1 to n of (xi * sum_{j=1 to i-1} xj)

The second term is sum over i,j with j < i of (xi * xj)

This is equal to (sum over i of xi)^2 - sum over i of xi^2

Which is k^2 - sum over i of xi^2

So total cost is sum over i of (xi * a_i) + k^2 - sum over i of xi^2

Wait, but I need to minimize this.

So, total cost = sum(xi * a_i) + k^2 - sum(xi^2)

I need to minimize sum(xi * a_i) - sum(xi^2)

Because k^2 is constant.

So, I need to minimize sum(xi * (a_i - xi))

Wait, but that seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as maximizing sum(xi^2) - sum(xi * a_i)

But I need to minimize the total cost, which is sum(xi * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} xj))

Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.

**Alternative Approach:**

Let me consider the incremental cost of buying a ticket on a particular day.

If I buy a ticket on day i, its cost is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I have a sequence of tickets assigned to days, the total cost is sum over each ticket of (a_i + number of tickets bought before it).

To minimize the total cost, I should assign the earliest tickets (those that increase the price the least) to the days with the lowest a_i.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

But with large n and k up to 1e9, I need an efficient algorithm.

**Sorting Days:**

Since lower a_i is better, I should consider buying tickets on days with lower a_i first.

But because buying on earlier days increases the prices for later days, I need to balance between buying on cheap days and not inflating the prices too much for more expensive days.

Wait, maybe I should sort the days by a_i in ascending order and then buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days first, up to the daily limit m.

But I need to account for the fact that buying x tickets on a day increases the price for subsequent days by x.

So, if I buy x tickets on a day, it increases the price for all remaining days by x.

Therefore, buying on cheaper days first might not be optimal because it affects the prices for more expensive days.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the net cost per ticket.

For each day, the cost per ticket is a_i plus the sum of x_j for all days j before i.

So, if I buy x tickets on day i, the cost is x * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

I need to minimize the sum of these costs over all days.

This seems complicated.

**Prefix Sum Idea:**

Let’s define s_i = sum_{j=1}^{i} x_j, the total tickets bought up to day i.

Then, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i

The cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

= sum over i from 1 to n of (x_i * a_i + x_i * s_{i-1})

But s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i

So, total cost = sum over i from 1 to n of (x_i * a_i + x_i * (s_i - x_i))

= sum over i from 1 to n of (x_i * a_i + x_i * s_i - x_i^2)

But s_i = sum_{j=1}^{i} x_j, which is cumulative.

This seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of dynamic programming.

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**

Let’s define dp[i][s], where i is the day index and s is the number of tickets bought so far.

But with s up to k and k can be up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a better way.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Let’s consider that the total cost is sum over all tickets of (a_i + number of tickets bought before it).

I need to assign each of the k tickets to one of the n days, respecting the daily limits.

The cost of a ticket bought on day i is a_i plus the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I have t_i tickets bought on day i, the cost for those tickets is t_i * a_i plus t_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} t_j.

So, total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * a_i + t_i * s_{i-1}, where s_{i-1} is the sum of t_j for j from 1 to i-1.

This can be written as sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * a_i + t_i * (s_i - t_i)

= sum over i from 1 to n of (t_i * a_i + t_i * s_i - t_i^2)

But s_i = sum over j=1 to i of t_j, which is equal to s_{i-1} + t_i.

Wait, this seems recursive.

Alternatively, sum over i of t_i * s_i = sum over i of t_i * (s_{i-1} + t_i) = sum over i of (t_i * s_{i-1} + t_i^2)

So, total cost becomes sum over i of (t_i * a_i + t_i * s_{i-1} + t_i^2 - t_i^2) = sum over i of (t_i * a_i + t_i * s_{i-1})

Which is the same as sum over i of t_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

This seems to be consistent with earlier observations.

But I need to minimize this sum.

**Optimal Strategy:**

To minimize the total cost, I need to minimize the sum of (t_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}))

Given that s_{i-1} is the sum of t_j for j from 1 to i-1, which is the total tickets bought before day i.

So, the cost of buying a ticket on day i is a_i plus the number of tickets bought before day i.

Therefore, the earlier tickets are more expensive because they increase the price for later tickets.

Hence, to minimize the total cost, I should buy tickets on days with lower a_i later, after buying on days with higher a_i.

Wait, but higher a_i would make the tickets more expensive if bought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I need to prioritize buying on days with lower a_i first, but considering the impact on future prices.

This is getting complicated.

**Another Idea:**

Let’s consider that I need to buy k tickets, and each ticket increases the price for future days.

So, I should try to buy tickets on days where the base price is low, but also minimize the number of tickets bought before that day.

So, perhaps I should buy tickets on days with the lowest a_i + number of tickets bought before that day.

But this is still confusing.

**Prefix Sum of Tickets:**

Let’s denote s_i as the total number of tickets bought on days 1 to i.

Then, the cost of buying t_i tickets on day i is t_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

So, total cost is sum over i of t_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

I need to minimize this sum, given that sum of t_i is k and t_i <= m for each i.

This seems like a linear objective function with constraints.

**Optimization Problem:**

Minimize sum over i of t_i * a_i + t_i * s_{i-1}

Subject to sum t_i = k and t_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a linear programming problem, but with integer constraints, it's more complex.

But given the constraints on n and k, I need an efficient algorithm.

**Greedy Approach Revisited:**

Perhaps a greedy approach where I always buy as many tickets as possible on the day with the lowest current price.

The current price on day i is a_i + s_{i-1}, where s_{i-1} is the total tickets bought before day i.

So, I can sort the days by their base price a_i, and try to buy tickets on the cheapest days first, updating the prices accordingly.

But since s_{i-1} depends on the order, it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe I can sort the days by a_i in ascending order and then buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the daily limits.

But I need to account for the price increases due to previous purchases.

This seems tricky.

**Alternative Insight:**

Let’s consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum over all tickets of (a_i + number of tickets bought before it).

So, each ticket bought on day i contributes a_i plus the number of tickets bought before day i.

To minimize the total cost, I should assign the tickets such that the tickets with the least increase (i.e., bought later) are assigned to days with the lowest a_i.

In other words, assign the earliest tickets (those that increase the price the least for future tickets) to the days with the highest a_i.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have to buy k tickets, and each ticket increases the price for future days.

So, the first ticket I buy will increase the price for all remaining k-1 tickets.

The second ticket I buy will increase the price for the remaining k-2 tickets, and so on.

So, the cost of buying a ticket includes its base price plus the number of future tickets multiplied by the increase per ticket.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as each ticket has a base cost a_i and an additional cost equal to the number of future tickets.

So, the total cost would be sum over all tickets of a_i + number of future tickets.

Wait, but the number of future tickets depends on the order in which I buy them.

This seems like a complex dependency.

**Mathematical Simplification:**

Let’s try to find a formula for the total cost.

Suppose I have t_i tickets bought on day i.

Then, the cost for these tickets is t_i * a_i + t_i * s_{i-1}, where s_{i-1} is the total tickets bought before day i.

So, total cost is sum over i of t_i * a_i + t_i * s_{i-1}

But s_{i-1} = sum over j=1 to i-1 of t_j

So, sum over i of t_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of t_i * sum over j=1 to i-1 of t_j

= sum over i,j where j < i of t_i * t_j

Similarly, (sum t_i)^2 = sum t_i^2 + 2 * sum over i,j with j < i of t_i * t_j

So, sum over i,j with j < i of t_i * t_j = (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

Wait, that seems off.

Actually, (sum t_i)^2 = sum t_i^2 + 2 * sum over i,j with j < i of t_i * t_j

So, sum over i,j with j < i of t_i * t_j = (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

No, wait:

(sum t_i)^2 = sum t_i^2 + 2 * sum over i < j of t_i * t_j

So, sum over i < j of t_i * t_j = (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

Wait, no.

Actually, (sum t_i)^2 = sum t_i^2 + 2 * sum over i < j of t_i * t_j

So, sum over i < j of t_i * t_j = ( (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i^2 ) / 2

Therefore, sum over i of t_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i < j of t_i * t_j

So, sum over i of t_i * s_{i-1} = (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here.

Actually, sum over i of t_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of t_i * sum over j=1 to i-1 of t_j = sum over i,j with j < i of t_i * t_j

Which, as above, is (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

Wait, but that seems incorrect.

Let me verify with small example.

Suppose n=3, t1=1, t2=2, t3=3, sum t_i = 6

sum over i < j of t_i * t_j = 1*2 + 1*3 + 2*3 = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11

(sum t_i)^2 = 36

sum t_i^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14

(sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i^2 = 36 - 14 = 22

22 / 2 = 11, which matches.

So, indeed, sum over i < j of t_i * t_j = (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

Therefore, sum over i of t_i * s_{i-1} = (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

Therefore, total cost is sum over i of t_i * a_i + (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

So, total cost = sum (t_i * a_i) + k^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

Now, I need to minimize this.

Given that k is fixed, k^2 is constant.

So, I need to minimize sum (t_i * a_i) - sum t_i^2 / 2

Therefore, the objective is to minimize sum (t_i * a_i - t_i^2 / 2)

Subject to sum t_i = k and t_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a standard optimization problem.

**Optimal t_i:**

To minimize sum over i of (t_i * a_i - t_i^2 / 2), subject to sum t_i = k and t_i <= m.

This looks like a quadratic function in t_i.

The function to minimize is sum over i of (-0.5 * t_i^2 + a_i * t_i)

This is a quadratic function in t_i, and the coefficient of t_i^2 is negative (-0.5), which means it's concave.

Wait, but we are trying to minimize it, so actually, we have a concave function to minimize, which would be maximized at the boundaries.

But I think I'm confusing myself.

Wait, if the function is concave, minimizing it would involve setting t_i to the boundaries.

But I need to think carefully.

**Lagrange Multipliers:**

Let’s try to use Lagrange multipliers to find the optimal t_i.

We have:

Minimize sum over i of (-0.5 * t_i^2 + a_i * t_i)

Subject to sum t_i = k and t_i <= m for all i.

Wait, but this seems off because earlier I had total cost = sum (t_i * a_i) + k^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

So, to minimize total cost, I need to minimize sum (t_i * a_i) - sum t_i^2 / 2

So, the function to minimize is sum (t_i * a_i - 0.5 * t_i^2)

This is a quadratic function in t_i, with coefficients for t_i^2 being -0.5, which is concave.

Wait, but we are trying to minimize a concave function, which is equivalent to maximizing a convex function.

This might not have a straightforward solution.

**Alternative Approach:**

Perhaps I should consider the dual problem or find a way to assign tickets to days optimally.

Let’s think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the days by a_i - t_i in some way.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of water-filling algorithm, where I distribute the tickets to days based on their a_i values.

But I need to account for the fact that buying on a day increases the price for future days.

This is getting too complicated.

**Observation:**

Given the constraints, perhaps the optimal strategy is to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

But I need a way to calculate this efficiently.

**Algorithm Idea:**

1. Sort the days by their base price a_i in ascending order.

2. Iterate through the sorted days and buy as many tickets as possible on each day, up to the daily limit m, considering the increased price due to previous purchases.

But I need to make sure that the total number of tickets bought is exactly k.

Also, I need to calculate the total cost accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can use a priority queue or something similar to always pick the day with the lowest current price.

But with n up to 3e5, I need an efficient way.

**Final Approach:**

After considering various approaches, I think the best way is to sort the days by their base price a_i in ascending order and then buy tickets starting from the cheapest days, considering the increased prices due to previous purchases.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Sort the days by a_i in ascending order.

2. Initialize the total cost and the cumulative number of tickets bought.

3. Iterate through the sorted days and for each day, calculate how many tickets can be bought without exceeding the daily limit m and without exceeding the remaining number of tickets needed.

4. For each day, calculate the cost of buying those tickets, considering the increased price due to previous purchases.

5. Update the total cost and the cumulative number of tickets bought.

6. Continue until all k tickets are bought.

But I need to make sure that I correctly account for the increased prices due to previous purchases.

Given the time constraints, I'll assume that the provided code implements this approach correctly.

**Checking the Provided Code:**

Looking at the provided code:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

l.sort()

s = 0

c = k * k / 2

for i in range(n):

s = min(m, k)

k -= s

c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2

print(int(c))

It seems to sort the days by a_i in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted list, buying up to m tickets per day, or up to the remaining k tickets.

It calculates the cost as l[i] * s - s * s / 2, where s is the number of tickets bought on that day.

Wait, according to earlier derivations, the cost should be s * (a_i + previous_tickets_bought).

But in this code, it's l[i] * s - s * s / 2, which seems inconsistent with the earlier formula.

Wait, perhaps the author has a different derivation.

Let me check.

Earlier, I derived that total cost is sum (t_i * a_i) + k^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

So, the code seems to be implementing c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2, and c starts with k * k / 2.

So, total c = k^2 / 2 + sum over days of (l[i] * s - s^2 / 2)

Which matches the earlier formula: sum (t_i * a_i) + k^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

Wait, but in my earlier step, total cost is sum (t_i * a_i) + k^2 - sum t_i^2 / 2

But in the code, c starts with k * k / 2, and then for each day, adds l[i] * s - s * s / 2.

So, total c = k^2 / 2 + sum over days of (l[i] * s - s^2 / 2)

Which seems correct based on the earlier derivation.

Therefore, the code seems to implement the correct formula.

Additionally, by sorting the days by a_i in ascending order and buying as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days first, it follows the greedy approach to minimize the cost.

Hence, I conclude that the provided code is correct.

**Final Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to minimize the cost of purchasing exactly k tickets across n days, given that the price per ticket increases based on the number of tickets purchased on previous days.

### Approach

1. **Sort the Days by Base Price:** By sorting the days based on the base price of tickets in ascending order, we ensure that we attempt to buy tickets on the cheapest days first.

2. **Calculate the Total Cost Using a Formula:** 
   - Initialize the total cost with `k * k / 2`, which accounts for the price increases due to the number of tickets bought on previous days.
   - For each day in the sorted list, buy as many tickets as possible without exceeding the daily
