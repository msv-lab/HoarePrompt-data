Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump right or down. It needs to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this string.

First, I need to understand what a path looks like. Since the grasshopper can only move right or down, in a 2xN grid, it has to make exactly N-1 right moves and 1 down move to get from (1,1) to (2,N). Wait, no. Actually, to get from (1,1) to (2,N), it needs to make N-1 right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any step between the first and the Nth move.

Wait, let's think carefully. The grasshopper starts at (1,1). Each move is either right or down, and it needs to end at (2,N). So, in total, it needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any position in the sequence of moves.

For example, in a 2x2 grid, possible paths are:

1. Right to (1,2), then down to (2,2). The string is a11 + a12 + a22.

2. Down to (2,1), then right to (2,2). The string is a11 + a21 + a22.

So, for N=2, with a11=0, a12=0, a21=0, a22=0, both paths give "000".

In the first test case, both paths give "000", so the smallest string is "000" and there are 2 paths that give this string.

In the second test case, with N=4, a1 = 1101, a2 = 1100, the possible paths and their strings are:

1. Right, right, right, down: a11 + a12 + a13 + a14 + a24 = 11010

2. Right, right, down, right: a11 + a12 + a13 + a23 + a24 = 11000

3. Right, down, right, right: a11 + a12 + a22 + a23 + a24 = 11000

4. Down, right, right, right: a11 + a21 + a22 + a23 + a24 = 11000

So, the smallest string is "11000", and there's only one path that gives this string, which is the first one: right, right, right, down.

Wait, actually, looking back at the output, it says "11000" and 1, but in my analysis, it seems that paths 2 and 3 also give "11000". So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's check the problem statement again. It says "the binary string of length N+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order."

So for N=2, it's length 3, which makes sense.

For N=4, it should be length 5.

Looking back at the second test case, a1 = 1101, a2 = 1100.

Paths:

1. Right, right, right, down: a11=1, a12=1, a13=0, a14=1, a24=0 → "11010"

2. Right, right, down, right: a11=1, a12=1, a13=0, a23=0, a24=0 → "11000"

3. Right, down, right, right: a11=1, a12=1, a22=1, a23=0, a24=0 → "11100"

4. Down, right, right, right: a11=1, a21=1, a22=1, a23=0, a24=0 → "11100"

So, the smallest string is "11000", and only one path gives this string, which is path 2.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought paths 2 and 3 give "11000", but actually path 3 gives "11100", which is larger.

So, why is only path 2 giving "11000"?

Wait, perhaps I misread the grid. Let's see.

Given a1 = 1101, a2 = 1100.

So, positions:

(1,1)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=0, (1,4)=1

(2,1)=1, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=0, (2,4)=0

So, path 1: right, right, right, down → 1,1,0,1,0 → "11010"

Path 2: right, right, down, right → 1,1,0,0,0 → "11000"

Path 3: right, down, right, right → 1,1,1,0,0 → "11100"

Path 4: down, right, right, right → 1,1,1,0,0 → "11100"

So, indeed, only path 2 gives "11000", which is the smallest.

Got it.

So, the goal is to find the smallest possible string among all possible paths and count how many paths give this string.

Constraints:

- T <= 10^4 test cases

- 2 <= N <= 2*10^5

- Sum of N over all test cases <= 2*10^5

So, time complexity should be O(T*N), which needs to be efficient.

Looking at the provided program:

It reads T, then loops T times calling func_1.

In func_1:

- Reads N

- Reads two binary strings a1 and a2

- Initializes s and x and y to 0

- Loops from i=0 to N-2:

- If a1[i+1] == '0' and a2[i] == '1', sets y=i

- If a1[i+1] == '1' and a2[i] == '0', sets s = a1[0:i+1] + a2[i:], x=i, and breaks

- If the loop doesn't break, sets s = a1 + a2[N-1], x=N-1

- Then finds t, the number of paths that give this string s

- Prints s and t

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let's try to understand what's happening.

First, it seems to be trying to find the smallest possible string s and the number of paths that give this string.

Looking at the first test case:

N=2, a1="00", a2="00"

It should output "000" and 2.

According to the code:

Loop from i=0 to 0 (N-2=0):

Check if a1[1]=='0' and a2[0]=='1': '0' and '0' → no

Check if a1[1]=='1' and a2[0]=='0': '0' and '0' → no

So, it sets s = a1 + a2[N-1] = "00" + "0" = "000", x=1

Then, it calculates t=1

But according to the sample output, t=2

So, perhaps there's an error in calculating t.

Looking deeper:

It tries to find where a1[i+1] == '0' and a2[i] == '1', setting y=i

And where a1[i+1] == '1' and a2[i] == '0', setting s and x and breaking

If no such i is found, sets s = a1 + a2[N-1], x=N-1

Then, calculates t based on some condition.

This seems too convoluted and might not be correct.

Let me think of a better approach.

To find the lexicographically smallest path, we need to choose, at each step, the path that leads to the smallest possible string.

Given that the grasshopper can only move right or down, and it has to go from (1,1) to (2,N), we can model this as a graph where each cell is a node, and edges are right and down moves.

But with N up to 2*10^5, we need an efficient algorithm.

An important observation is that the grasshopper can only switch from row 1 to row 2 at most once, since it can only move down once.

Therefore, all paths can be described by the column index where the switch from row 1 to row 2 occurs.

In other words, the grasshopper can choose to stay in row 1 for the first k columns, and then switch to row 2 for the remaining columns, for some k from 0 to N.

Wait, but in a 2xN grid, the grasshopper can switch rows only once, by moving down at some point.

Wait, actually, the grasshopper can only move down once, since it starts at row 1 and needs to end at row 2.

Therefore, the path is determined by the column index where the down move occurs.

So, the down move can happen after any number of right moves, from 0 to N-1.

Therefore, there are N possible down move positions:

- Down at the first step: go from (1,1) to (2,1), then right to (2,2), ..., (2,N)

- Right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,3), ..., (2,N)

- ...

- Right to (1,N), then down to (2,N)

So, for each possible down move position, we can construct the corresponding string.

Our task is to find the smallest such string and count how many paths give this string.

But since the grasshopper can only move right or down, and the down move can only happen once, then for each possible position to perform the down move, we can construct the path and the corresponding string.

Then, among all these strings, find the smallest one and count how many paths give that string.

But with N up to 2*10^5, we need a way to find the smallest string without generating all possible strings.

Let's think differently.

Let's consider that the path is determined by the column index where the down move occurs.

Let's denote k as the column index where the down move occurs, with k ranging from 0 to N-1.

- If k=0, the path is down to (2,1), then right to (2,2), ..., (2,N). The string is a11 + a21 to a2N.

- If k=1, the path is right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,3), ..., (2,N). The string is a11 + a12 + a22 to a2N.

- ...

- If k=N-1, the path is right to (1,N), then down to (2,N). The string is a11 + a12 + ... + a1N + a2N.

So, for each k from 0 to N-1, the string is:

- For k=0: a11 + a21 to a2N

- For k=1: a11 + a12 + a22 to a2N

- ...

- For k=N-1: a11 + a12 + ... + a1N + a2N

Our task is to find the smallest among these strings and count how many k give this smallest string.

This seems manageable.

Let's think about how to efficiently find the smallest string among these possibilities.

We have N different strings, each corresponding to a different k.

We need to find the smallest one among them.

Given that N can be up to 2*10^5, we need an efficient way to compare these strings without generating all of them explicitly.

Let's consider that all these strings have length N+1.

We can think of them as being aligned, and we can compare them position by position.

Let's consider the strings for k=0 to k=N-1.

At position 1:

- For k=0: a11

- For k=1: a11

- ...

- For k=N-1: a11

So, the first character is always a11.

At position 2:

- For k=0: a21

- For k=1: a12

- For k=2: a12

- ...

- For k=N-1: a12

And so on.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think again.

For each k, the string is constructed as follows:

- For k=0: a11, a21, a22, ..., a2N

- For k=1: a11, a12, a22, a23, ..., a2N

- For k=2: a11, a12, a13, a23, a24, ..., a2N

- ...

- For k=N-1: a11, a12, ..., a1N, a2N

So, in general, for a given k, the string is:

- a11, a12, ..., a1(k+1), a2(k+1), a2(k+2), ..., a2N

Wait, no.

Wait, for k=0: down at column 1, so path is (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> ... -> (2,N). String is a11, a21, a22, ..., a2N.

For k=1: right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,3), ..., (2,N). String is a11, a12, a22, a23, ..., a2N.

For k=2: right to (1,2), right to (1,3), down to (2,3), then right to (2,4), ..., (2,N). String is a11, a12, a13, a23, a24, ..., a2N.

...

For k=N-1: right to (1,2), ..., right to (1,N), down to (2,N). String is a11, a12, ..., a1N, a2N.

So, for each k, the string is:

- a11, a12, ..., a1(k+1), a2(k+1), a2(k+2), ..., a2N

Wait, no, for k=0: a11, a21, a22, ..., a2N

For k=1: a11, a12, a22, a23, ..., a2N

For k=2: a11, a12, a13, a23, a24, ..., a2N

...

For k=N-1: a11, a12, ..., a1N, a2N

So, in general, for k=i, the string is a11, a12, ..., a1(i+1), a2(i+1), a2(i+2), ..., a2N

So, the transition from row 1 to row 2 happens after a1(i+1).

Our goal is to find the smallest string among these N options.

To find the smallest string, we can think of it as finding the smallest sequence in lexicographical order among these N sequences.

To do this efficiently, we can find the minimal possible character at each position, considering the constraints imposed by the previous positions.

But perhaps a better way is to iterate through the columns and decide the best possible move at each step to minimize the string.

Let me think about it differently.

Let's consider that we can maintain two potential current positions: one in row 1 and one in row 2.

We start at (1,1).

At each step, we can choose to move right in the current row or, if possible, move down to the other row and move right there.

Our aim is to choose the path that leads to the smallest possible string.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where we keep track of the current row and column and choose the next move that minimizes the string.

However, with N up to 2*10^5, we need an O(N) solution.

Let me think of it this way: we can iterate through the columns from left to right and decide at each step whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row.

We need to keep track of the current row we are in and choose the path that gives the smallest possible string.

Wait, but since we can only switch rows once, it's actually simpler.

We can consider that we stay in row 1 until some column k, then switch to row 2 and stay there.

So, we need to choose the optimal k that leads to the smallest string.

Therefore, we can iterate through all possible k from 0 to N-1 and select the one that gives the smallest string.

But with N=2*10^5, iterating through all k and comparing strings would be too slow because string comparison takes O(N) time, leading to O(N^2) total time.

Therefore, we need a smarter way to find the minimal string among these options.

Let's consider that all strings share the first character a11.

Then, the second character depends on whether we switch rows at k=0 or not.

If k=0, the second character is a21.

If k>=1, the second character is a12.

So, we should choose the smallest second character between a21 and a12.

Similarly, for subsequent characters, we need to choose the path that leads to the smallest possible character at each position.

Wait, perhaps we can use a greedy approach here.

Start at (1,1).

At each step, choose the move (right or down) that leads to the smallest possible next character.

However, since we can only move down once, we need to decide when to make that down move to minimize the string.

Let me think about it.

Initialize current row as 1.

Initialize the current path as [a11].

Then, for each position from 1 to N:

If current row is 1:

Option 1: move right to (1, j+1)

Option 2: move down to (2, j) and then right to (2, j+1)

Choose the option that gives the smallest possible next character.

Wait, but we need to consider the entire remaining path.

This seems tricky.

Maybe we can precompute for each possible k the string it would produce and then find the minimal one.

But again, that would be O(N^2).

Wait, perhaps we can find the minimal k that gives the smallest string.

Let's consider that we can iterate through the columns and find the first position where switching rows gives a smaller string.

Wait, perhaps better to find the minimal possible string by choosing the optimal k.

Let me consider that the string for k is:

s_k = a11, a12, ..., a1(k+1), a2(k+1), a2(k+2), ..., a2N

We need to find the minimal s_k among all k from 0 to N-1.

To optimize this, we can find the minimal prefix among all s_k.

Let's try to find the point where switching from row 1 to row 2 gives the smallest possible string.

We can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string by choosing to switch at the optimal column.

Wait, maybe it's better to iterate through the columns and decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2 at each step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize current string as a11.

Initialize current row as 1.

Then, for each column from 1 to N:

If current row is 1:

Option 1: move right to (1, j+1), add a1(j+1) to the string.

Option 2: move down to (2, j), then add a2(j) to the string, and from now on, stay in row 2.

Choose the option that leads to the smallest possible string.

Similarly, if current row is 2:

Only option is to move right to (2, j+1), add a2(j+1) to the string.

This seems like a dynamic programming approach where we keep track of the current row and the current string prefix.

However, since we are dealing with strings and need to compare them lexicographically at each step, it might be too slow.

We need a smarter way.

Let's consider that once we switch to row 2, we have to stay in row 2.

So, the string is prefix from row 1 up to some point, and then suffix from row 2.

Our aim is to choose the switch point that gives the smallest possible concatenation of prefix and suffix.

To optimize this, we can find the minimal possible prefix from row 1 and suffix from row 2.

Wait, but it's not just about minimal prefix and suffix, but about their concatenation.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that we can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string by choosing to switch at each possible column.

To optimize this, perhaps we can find the minimal possible string by choosing the switch column that minimizes the concatenation of the two parts.

Wait, perhaps we can find the minimal possible string by finding the minimal possible a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N] among all k from 0 to N-1.

To find the minimal such concatenation, we can iterate through k from 0 to N-1 and choose the k that gives the smallest s_k.

But again, comparing strings for each k would be too slow for large N.

We need a way to find the minimal s_k efficiently.

Let me consider that to compare two strings s_k and s_m, with k < m, we need to compare a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N] with a1[1 to m+1] + a2[m+1 to N].

To make this efficient, perhaps we can find the position where the strings differ and compare the characters at that position.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that the strings differ at the position where a1 and a2 differ in the overlapping parts.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string by choosing to switch at the optimal column.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize the minimal string as the string for k=0, which is a11 + a21 to a2N.

Then, for each k from 1 to N-1:

Compute s_k = a11 to a1(k+1) + a2(k+1) to a2N

Compare s_k with the current minimal string and update if s_k is smaller.

Finally, after checking all k, output the minimal s_k and count how many k give this s_k.

But as mentioned earlier, this would be O(N^2) time, which is too slow for N=2*10^5.

We need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the strings s_k and s_m, for k < m, differ starting from the position where a1(j) != a2(j) for some j.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal s_k by finding the minimal possible a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N].

To optimize this, perhaps I can find the minimal possible a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N] by finding the minimal possible a1[1 to k+1] and a2[k+1 to N].

But since these parts are concatenated, I need to consider their lexicographical order.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible character at each position.

Let me try to think of it as merging two strings: a1 and a2, with a specific structure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the strings as a combination of prefix from a1 and suffix from a2, starting from different points.

Let me consider that s_k = a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N]

So, s_k = a1[1] a1[2] ... a1[k+1] a2[k+1] ... a2[N]

Our aim is to find the minimal s_k among all k from 0 to N-1.

To find the minimal s_k, we can iterate through k from 0 to N-1 and keep track of the minimal s_k.

But again, this is O(N^2) in time.

I need a way to compute this in O(N) time.

Let me consider that to compare s_k and s_m, with k < m, I can compare a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N] with a1[1 to m+1] + a2[m+1 to N].

To make this efficient, perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimums for a2 and prefix values for a1.

Wait, but lexicographical comparison is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the first position where a1 and a2 differ, and choose the k that gives the smallest character at that position.

Let me try to formalize this.

Find the minimal s_k by finding the minimal possible a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N].

To find the minimal s_k, we can find the minimal possible a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N] for all k.

To optimize this, perhaps we can find the position where a1 and a2 differ and choose the k that minimizes the string starting from that position.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string by choosing to switch at each possible column.

Wait, maybe I need to find the minimal possible s_k by finding the minimal possible a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N].

To make this efficient, perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimums for a2 and prefix values for a1.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire string.

Let me consider that the strings s_k are a combination of prefix from a1 and suffix from a2.

So, perhaps I can iterate through k from 0 to N-1 and find the minimal s_k.

But again, this seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where a1 and a2 differ and choose the k that gives the smallest string based on those differences.

Let me consider that if a1[j] < a2[j], then choosing k < j would be better because s_k would have a1[j] in its string, which is smaller.

Similarly, if a1[j] > a2[j], then choosing k >= j would be better.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal k such that a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N] is minimal.

This sounds similar to finding the minimal possible concatenation of prefix and suffix.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal k where a1[1 to k+1] is minimal compared to a2[k+1 to N].

This is still confusing.

Let me think about the first position where a1 and a2 differ.

Suppose a1 and a2 differ at position j.

Then, for k < j, s_k would have a2[j], and for k >= j, s_k would have a1[j].

So, I need to choose k such that the character at position j is minimal.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the first position where a1 and a2 differ, and then choose the k that gives the smallest character at that position.

This seems a bit vague.

Let me try to think in terms of finding the minimal s_k efficiently.

Perhaps I can precompute the minimal s_k by finding the point where switching from a1 to a2 gives the smallest possible string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string by choosing to switch at each possible column and keep the minimal one.

But again, this seems too slow.

Let me consider that the minimal s_k is the one where a1[1 to k+1] is as small as possible, and a2[k+1 to N] is as small as possible.

So, perhaps I can find the k where a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N] is minimal.

To optimize this, perhaps I can find the point where a1 starts being larger than a2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal k such that a1[1 to k+1] <= a2[1 to k+1], and a1[k+2 to N] <= a2[k+2 to N].

But since a1 and a2 are different, this might not directly apply.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of suffix arrays or some string matching algorithm.

But given time constraints, I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that the minimal s_k is the one where the switch from a1 to a2 happens at the optimal column.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal s_k found so far.

To optimize this, perhaps I can find the minimal possible a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N] by iterating through k and keeping track of the minimal concatenation.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal possible s_k by finding the minimal possible a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N].

To make this efficient, perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimums for a2 and prefix values for a1.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire string, not just individual characters.

Let me consider that to compare s_k and s_m, with k < m, I can compare a1[1 to k+1] + a2[k+1 to N] and a1[1 to m+1] + a2[m+1 to N].

To make this efficient, perhaps I can find the point where a1 and a2 differ and choose k based on that.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the first position where a1 and a2 differ, and then choose the k that gives the smallest character at that position.

Let me try an example.

Take N=4, a1=1101, a2=1100.

So, positions:

1: a1=1, a2=1 → same

2: a1=1, a2=1 → same

3: a1=0, a2=0 → same

4: a1=1, a2=0 → differ

So, the first position where a1 and a2 differ is position 4.

Therefore, for k < 3 (since k starts from 0), s_k would have a2[4]='0'

For k >=3, s_k would have a1[4]='1'

So, s_k for k <3 would have '0' at position 4, and for k >=3, '1' at position 4.

Therefore, the minimal s_k would be the one with '0' at position 4, so k <3.

But among k=0,1,2, which one gives the smallest s_k?

Let's look at s0: a11 + a21 to a24: 1,1,0,0 → "11000"

s1: a11,a12 + a22 to a24: 1,1,0,0 → "11000"

s2: a11,a12,a13 + a23 to a24: 1,1,0,0 → "11000"

s3: a11,a12,a13,a14 + a24: 1,1,0,1,0 → "11010"

So, s0, s1, s2 are "11000", and s3 is "11010"

So, the minimal s_k is "11000", achieved for k=0,1,2.

But according to the sample output, it's "11000" with only 1 path.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says only one path gives "11000", which is k=2.

Wait, no, in my earlier analysis, paths 2 and 3 give "11000", but according to the sample output, it's only one path.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that s1 is "1,1,0,0,0" which is "11000", s2 is "1,1,0,0,0" which is "11000", and s3 is "1,1,0,1,0" which is "11010".

But according to the sample output, only one path gives "11000".

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that s2 is "1,1,0,0,0" which is "11000", and s3 is "1,1,0,1,0" which is "11010".

But in the sample output, it's "11000" with t=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that only k=2 gives "11000", and k=0 and k=1 give different strings.

Wait, no, in my earlier analysis, k=0: s0="11000", k=1: s1="11000", k=2: s2="11000", k=3: s3="11010"

But sample output says t=1, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample explanation.

Wait, in the problem statement, for the second test case, it says:

"11000

1"

But according to my analysis, k=0,1,2 all give "11000", while k=3 gives "11010".

So, perhaps the sample is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the path corresponding to k=0 is "1,1,0,0,0" which is "1
