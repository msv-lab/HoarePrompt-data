Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about determining who wins in a game between Anna and Sasha based on a list of integers and some parameters. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

So, Anna and Sasha are playing a game with a list of integers. The list has 'n' integers, and there's this parameter 'm' which is used to decide the winning condition.

First, I need to understand the moves each player can make.

Anna goes first. On her turn, Anna must choose one element from the list and reverse its digits, removing any leading zeros. So, for example, if she chooses 42, it becomes 24. If she chooses 1580, it becomes 851. The number of elements in the list remains the same after her move.

Then, Sasha takes his turn. He must choose two different elements from the list, concatenate them in any order, and insert the result back into the list. For example, if he chooses 2007 and 19, he can create either 200719 or 192007, and then put this new number back into the list. After his move, the number of elements in the list decreases by one because he removes two and adds one.

They alternate turns until the game ends. The game ends when there's only one number left in the list, and at that point, Sasha wins if that number is at least 10^m, otherwise Anna wins.

I need to determine, for given n, m, and the list of integers, who will win if both play optimally.

Alright, let's think about how the game progresses.

The game alternates between Anna and Sasha. Anna starts. The game ends when there's only one number left, which means that the total number of moves is n-1, since each move reduces the number of elements by one (Sasha's move) or keeps it the same (Anna's move).

Wait, Anna's move doesn't reduce the number of elements; she just reverses the digits of one element. So, the number of elements decreases only when Sasha makes a move.

So, the game proceeds with Anna and Sasha taking turns, but the number of elements decreases only when Sasha makes a move.

Let me try to model this.

Letâ€™s see: the game starts with n elements.

Each time Sasha makes a move, he removes two and adds one, so the number of elements decreases by one.

Anna's move doesn't change the number of elements.

The game ends when there's only one element left.

So, the number of Sasha's moves will be n-1, because each of his moves reduces the number of elements by one, starting from n down to 1.

But wait, Anna can also make moves in between.

Wait, no. Actually, the problem says that players take turns, Anna goes first, and they can't skip turns.

But, looking back at the description:

- Anna's move: choose one element, reverse its digits, leading zeros removed.

- Sasha's move: choose two elements, concatenate them in any order, insert the result back.

- Players can't skip turns.

- The game ends when there's exactly one element left, and it's Sasha's turn to play next (since after Anna's move there's one element left, Sasha can't make a move).

Wait, no. Let's read carefully:

"The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e., after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list."

So, the game ends when there's one element left, and it's Sasha's turn to play, but he can't because he needs at least two elements to make a move.

So, the game ends after Anna's move when there's one element left.

At that point, if that one element is at least 10^m, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

I need to determine, with both playing optimally, who wins.

Alright, let's think about the game in terms of the number of elements.

Starting with n elements.

Each time Sasha makes a move, he reduces the number of elements by one.

Anna's move doesn't change the number of elements.

So, the game can be modeled as a sequence of moves where Anna can choose to reverse any element, and Sasha can choose to concatenate any two elements.

The game continues until there's only one element left, and then we check if it's >= 10^m.

I need to find out who can force the final number to be >= 10^m or < 10^m, depending on their moves.

This seems like a game theory problem where I need to find the optimal strategy for both players.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t (number of test cases) is up to 10^4, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case or better.

Looking at the reference solution:

It seems to calculate the total number of digits in all numbers and subtract some zero counts in a specific way, then check if the result is >= m+1.

Wait, let's look at the reference solution code.

The reference solution is:

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, m, nums))

def func_1(n, m, nums):

tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))

cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)

for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):

tot -= cntvals[i]

return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

def zerocnts(num):

num = str(num)

tot = 0

for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):

if num[i] != '0':

break

tot += 1

return tot

So, it calculates the total number of digits in all numbers, then sorts the zero counts in the numbers in descending order, and subtracts the zero counts from every second position (starting from 0, stepping by 2).

Then, it checks if the resulting total is >= m+1, and if so, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First, let's understand what 'zerocnts' does.

'zerocnts' counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.

For example:

- 100 -> '100' -> counts from the end: '0','0' -> tot=2

- 123 -> '123' -> no zeros at the end -> tot=0

- 405 -> '405' -> only '5' at the end, no zeros -> tot=0

- 10 -> '10' -> one trailing zero -> tot=1

So, it's counting the number of trailing zeros in the number.

Then, in 'func_1', it calculates the total number of digits in all numbers, sums them up.

Then, it sorts the trailing zero counts in descending order and subtracts every second one from the total.

Finally, it checks if the adjusted total is >= m+1 to decide the winner.

I need to see if this logic correctly determines the winner based on optimal play.

Let me think about the game mechanics.

Anna can reverse any number's digits, which effectively can change the number, potentially affecting the number of digits or the value.

Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, in any order, and add the result back to the list.

The game continues until there's only one number left, and then we check if it's >= 10^m.

I need to see how Anna and Sasha can influence the final number.

Anna can reverse numbers, which might make them smaller or larger, depending on the number.

Sasha can concatenate numbers in a way that maximizes or minimizes the final number.

Given that both play optimally, I need to see who can force the final number to be >=10^m or <10^m.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider the total number of digits.

Initially, the total number of digits in all numbers is sum of len(str(a_i)) for all a_i.

Each time Sasha concatenates two numbers, he removes two and adds one, so the total number of elements decreases by one, but the total number of digits remains the same because concatenating two numbers combines their digits into one number.

Wait, no. Concatenating two numbers actually combines their digits, so the total number of digits remains the same.

For example, 123 and 456 concatenated can be 123456 or 456123, but the total number of digits is len(123) + len(456).

So, the total number of digits doesn't change with Sasha's moves.

Anna's moves, on the other hand, reverse the digits of a number, which doesn't change the number of digits, just the order.

So, the total number of digits remains constant throughout the game.

At the end, when there's only one number left, its number of digits is equal to the initial total number of digits.

So, if the total number of digits is greater than or equal to m+1 (since 10^m has m zeros, meaning it has m+1 digits), then the final number has at least m+1 digits, which means it's at least 10^m.

Wait, 10^m has m zeros, but the number of digits is m+1.

For example, 100 has 3 digits, which is 10^2.

So, if the final number has at least m+1 digits, it's at least 10^m.

Therefore, if the total number of digits is >= m+1, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

But, the reference solution seems to adjust the total number of digits by subtracting some zero counts.

Wait, why is it subtracting zero counts?

Let me look again.

In 'func_1', it calculates tot as the sum of lengths of all numbers.

Then, it sorts the zerocnts in descending order and subtracts every second one from tot.

zerocnts counts the trailing zeros in each number.

So, it's subtracting the trailing zeros of every second number (in the sorted list of trailing zeros).

I need to understand why it's doing that.

Maybe it's considering that Anna can reverse numbers, which can affect the trailing zeros.

If Anna reverses a number, the trailing zeros become leading zeros, which are removed.

So, by reversing, Anna can eliminate trailing zeros.

Therefore, Anna can choose to reverse some numbers to eliminate their trailing zeros, thereby reducing the total number of digits.

But, since leading zeros are removed, reversing a number with trailing zeros effectively removes those zeros.

So, Anna can choose to reverse numbers with trailing zeros to make them shorter.

Therefore, the total number of digits can be reduced by Anna by reversing numbers with trailing zeros.

The reference solution seems to be accounting for this by subtracting the trailing zeros from every second number.

Wait, but why every second number?

I think it's considering that Anna can choose to reverse some numbers to eliminate their trailing zeros, and Sasha can't do anything to prevent that.

So, Anna can choose to reverse numbers in such a way to minimize the final number of digits, if she wants Anna to win, or maximize it, if Sasha wants to win.

But, in the reference solution, it's subtracting the trailing zeros from every second number in the sorted list.

This seems to be modeling that Anna can reverse half of the numbers (specifically, every second one in the sorted list) to eliminate their trailing zeros.

But, I'm not entirely sure why it's doing it this way.

Maybe it's considering that Anna can choose to reverse the numbers with the highest trailing zeros, every alternate one, to minimize the total digits.

But, I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's considering that Anna can reverse up to floor(n/2) numbers to eliminate their trailing zeros.

But, in the code, it's iterating over the sorted trailing zero counts with a step of 2 and subtracting them from the total digit count.

This seems like it's assuming that Anna can eliminate the trailing zeros from every second number in the sorted list.

I need to verify if this is the correct way to model Anna's optimal play.

Let me consider a simple example.

Take n=2, m=2

nums = [14, 2]

Total digits: len(14)=2, len(2)=1 => tot=3

zerocnts:

14: no trailing zeros => 0

2: no trailing zeros => 0

sorted cntvals: [0,0]

subtract every second one: 0 and 0 => tot -= 0 => tot=3

Check if 3 >= 2+1=3 => yes, Sasha wins.

Which matches the first test case.

Another test case:

n=3, m=5

nums=[9,56,1]

Total digits: 1+2+1=4

zerocnts:

9: 0

56: 0

1: 0

sorted cntvals: [0,0,0]

subtract every second one: 0 and 0 => tot -= 0 => tot=4

Check if 4 >= 5+1=6 => no, Anna wins.

But according to the sample output, it's "Anna", which matches.

Another test case:

n=4, m=10

nums=[1,2007,800,1580]

Total digits: 1 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 12

zerocnts:

1: 0

2007: 0

800: 2

1580: 1

sorted cntvals: [2,1,0,0]

subtract every second one: 2 and 0 => tot -= 2 => tot=12-2=10

Check if 10 >= 10+1=11 => no, Anna wins.

But according to the sample output, it's "Anna", which matches.

Another test case:

n=4, m=5

nums=[5000,123,30,4]

Total digits: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10

zerocnts:

5000: 3

123: 0

30: 1

4: 0

sorted cntvals: [3,1,0,0]

subtract every second one: 3 and 0 => tot -= 3 => tot=10-3=7

Check if 7 >= 5+1=6 => yes, Sasha wins.

Which matches the sample output "Sasha".

Seems correct so far.

Another test case:

n=1, m=1

nums=[6]

Total digits: 1

zerocnts: [0]

subtract every second one: 0 => tot=1-0=1

Check if 1 >= 1+1=2 => no, Anna wins.

Which should be "Anna", but according to the sample output, it's "Anna".

Wait, but in the sample input, n=4, m=5, nums=[5000,123,30,4], output is "Sasha", which matches.

Wait, but in the earlier test case with n=1, m=1, nums=[6], output should be "Anna", which matches.

Another test case:

n=1, m=1

nums=[10]

Total digits: 2

zerocnts: [1]

subtract every second one: 1 => tot=2-1=1

Check if 1 >= 1+1=2 => no, Anna wins.

Which should be "Anna", matching the sample output.

Another test case:

n=8, m=9

nums=[1,2,9,10,10,2,10,2]

Total digits: 1+1+1+2+2+1+2+1=11

zerocnts:

1:0

2:0

9:0

10:1

10:1

2:0

10:1

2:0

sorted cntvals: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]

subtract every second one: 1,0 => tot=11 -1 -0=10

Check if 10 >= 9+1=10 => yes, Sasha wins.

But according to the sample output, it's "Anna", which doesn't match.

Wait, in the sample input, the last test case is:

4 5

10 10 10 10

Output: Sasha

But I have another test case with n=8, m=9, nums=[1,2,9,10,10,2,10,2], which should be "Sasha" according to my calculation, but the sample output says "Anna".

Wait, no, looking back, in the sample input, n=8, m=9, nums=[1,2,9,10,10,2,10,2], output is "Anna".

But according to my calculation, tot=11 -1 -0=10 >=10, so Sasha wins, but sample output is "Anna".

Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let's recalculate.

n=8, m=9

nums=[1,2,9,10,10,2,10,2]

Total digits: 1+1+1+2+2+1+2+1=11

zerocnts:

1:0

2:0

9:0

10:1

10:1

2:0

10:1

2:0

sorted cntvals: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]

subtract every second one: idx 0 and idx 2: 1 and 1 => tot=11-1-1=9

Check if 9 >= 9+1=10 => no, Anna wins.

Which matches the sample output "Anna".

I must have missed that.

So, in this case, subtracting every second one means subtracting cntvals[0], cntvals[2], cntvals[4], etc.

In this case, cntvals=[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0], so subtract cntvals[0]=1 and cntvals[2]=1, tot=11-1-1=9, which is less than 10, so Anna wins.

Got it.

So, the logic seems to be working correctly.

Therefore, I can conclude that the reference solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
