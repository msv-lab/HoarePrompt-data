Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and set the prices in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES", followed by the number of stalls and their prices. If not, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand the constraints and what they imply. The key points are:

- Alice buys jewels greedily, starting from stall 1 to stall s.

- Each stall has a price per jewel, which is an integer between 1 and 10^18.

- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.

- I need to ensure that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Given that Bob can set up to 60 stalls, and each stall can have a different price, I need to find a combination of stall prices that will make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Let me think about the simplest cases first.

**Case 1: n < k**

If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she needs to buy, it's impossible for her to buy k jewels, because even if each jewel costs only 1 coin, she can't afford all k of them. So, in this case, the answer should be "NO".

**Case 2: n == k**

If Alice has exactly k coins, and each jewel costs 1 coin, then she can buy exactly k jewels. So, in this case, I can set up one stall with price 1, and she will buy k jewels. So, the answer is "YES", with s=1 and p1=1.

Wait, but the problem says that the price can be between 1 and 10^18. So, in this case, setting up one stall with price 1 should work.

**Case 3: n > k**

This is the tricky part. Alice has more coins than the number of jewels she needs to buy. I need to set up stalls in such a way that she buys exactly k jewels, without spending all her coins.

I need to think about how Alice buys the jewels. She goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins.

So, if I set up stalls with increasing prices, she will buy fewer jewels at each subsequent stall.

Let me consider an example to understand this better.

**Example 1:**

n = 7, k = 3

One possible solution is to set up 10 stalls with prices 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Let's see how Alice would buy jewels:

- Stall 1: price = 2

- She can buy 7 // 2 = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Since she has only 1 coin left, she can't buy any jewels from the remaining stalls.

- Total jewels bought: 3.

This matches k=3, so it's a valid solution.

**Example 2:**

n = 6, k = 4

The sample output is "NO", meaning it's impossible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

I need to understand why it's impossible in this case.

Let's try to think of possible stall setups.

- If I set up one stall with price 1: she buys 6 jewels, which is more than 4.

- If I set up one stall with price 2: she buys 3 jewels, which is less than 4.

- If I set up two stalls: first with price 2, second with price 1.

- At stall 1: buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more jewels.

- Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

- If first stall price 1, second stall price 2.

- At stall 1: buys 6 jewels, which is more than 4.

- Already bought more than k, so not acceptable.

- Trying other combinations doesn't seem to work.

Hence, it's impossible, and the answer is "NO".

**Example 3:**

n = 255, k = 8

One possible solution is to set up 8 stalls with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

Let's see:

- Stall 1: price 128

- Buys 255 // 128 = 1 jewel, spends 128, left with 127.

- Stall 2: price 64

- Buys 127 // 64 = 1 jewel, spends 64, left with 63.

- Stall 3: price 32

- Buys 63 // 32 = 1 jewel, spends 32, left with 31.

- Stall 4: price 16

- Buys 31 // 16 = 1 jewel, spends 16, left with 15.

- Stall 5: price 8

- Buys 15 // 8 = 1 jewel, spends 8, left with 7.

- Stall 6: price 4

- Buys 7 // 4 = 1 jewel, spends 4, left with 3.

- Stall 7: price 2

- Buys 3 // 2 = 1 jewel, spends 2, left with 1.

- Stall 8: price 1

- Buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, spends 1, left with 0.

- Total jewels: 8, which matches k.

So, this is a valid solution.

From these examples, I need to find a general approach to determine if it's possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Let me think about the general strategy.

I need to ensure that the total number of jewels Alice buys is exactly k.

Given that she buys as many jewels as possible at each stall, the number of jewels bought at each stall is floor(n / p_i), where p_i is the price at stall i.

I need to choose p_1, p_2, ..., p_s such that sum(floor(n / p_i)) = k.

Additionally, s <= 60.

This seems complicated, but maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Looking back at the examples, in the first example, they used a decreasing sequence of prices, and in the third example, they used a decreasing sequence of prices that are powers of 2.

Maybe using powers of 2 is a general strategy.

Let's consider using powers of 2 for the stall prices.

Suppose I set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, starting from the highest possible that is <= n.

For example, in the third example, n=255, k=8, they used 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, which are powers of 2.

In this case, Alice buys one jewel from each stall, which sums up to k=8.

This seems similar to the binary representation of n.

In binary representation, each bit corresponds to a power of 2, and the number of set bits is the number of stalls needed.

For example, 255 in binary is 11111111, which has 8 set bits, corresponding to the 8 stalls.

So, if k is equal to the number of set bits in n's binary representation, then setting up stalls with prices corresponding to those set bits would make Alice buy exactly one jewel from each stall, totaling k jewels.

But in the first example, n=7, k=3, and 7 in binary is 111, which has 3 set bits. So, setting up 3 stalls with prices 4,2,1 would make Alice buy one jewel from each, totaling 3 jewels.

But in the first example, they set up 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, which is more than necessary.

So, maybe there's a better way.

Wait, but in the first example, setting up stalls with prices that are powers of 2 would also work, but they chose a different approach.

Perhaps, to minimize the number of stalls, we can set up stalls with prices that are factors of the remaining coins.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so maybe we can always find a solution with s <= 60.

Wait, but the second example shows that it's not always possible.

So, I need to find a condition under which it's possible.

Let me think about the minimal number of stalls required.

If I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, and Alice buys a1, a2, ..., as jewels respectively, where a1 + a2 + ... + as = k.

Each ai = floor(n / pi), and n is reduced by ai * pi after each stall.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n / pi) over i from 1 to s is exactly k.

This seems tricky to solve directly, so maybe I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

If I set up one stall with price p, then Alice buys floor(n / p) jewels.

To make floor(n / p) = k, p must satisfy floor(n / k) <= p <= floor(n / (k+1)) + 1 or something like that.

But this is for one stall only.

But in our problem, we can have up to 60 stalls, so it's more flexible.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the remaining coins after each stall.

Let me try to model the process.

Let n0 = n be the initial number of coins.

After the first stall, Alice buys a1 = floor(n0 / p1) jewels, and the remaining coins are n1 = n0 - a1 * p1.

After the second stall, she buys a2 = floor(n1 / p2) jewels, and remaining coins n2 = n1 - a2 * p2.

And so on, until the s-th stall.

The total jewels bought is a1 + a2 + ... + as = k.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that this sum is k.

This seems too general to solve directly.

Maybe I need to find a way to decompose k into a sum of a1, a2, ..., as, where each ai is floor(n_{i-1} / pi), and n_i = n_{i-1} - ai * pi.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

I need to ensure that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

One way to think about it is to maximize the number of jewels bought, given the constraints.

But in this problem, I need to make it exactly k, so it's more about finding a specific combination.

Maybe I can think in terms of the remaining coins after each stall.

Let me consider that after s stalls, the remaining coins are n_s = n - sum_{i=1 to s} ai * pi.

And ai = floor(n_{i-1} / pi).

This seems too involved.

Let me look for a different strategy.

Looking back at the examples, in the first example, they set up 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, and Alice buys 3 jewels in total.

In the third example, they set up 8 stalls with prices that are powers of 2, and Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

So, in the first example, they set up more stalls than necessary, but Alice only buys jewels from the first stall because she spends all her coins there.

Wait, no, in the first example, she buys 3 jewels from the first stall and is left with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy any jewels from the remaining stalls.

So, she only interacts with the first stall.

In the third example, she buys one jewel from each stall, interacting with all 8 stalls.

So, in some cases, she only interacts with one stall, and in other cases, with multiple stalls.

I need to find a general way to set up the stalls such that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

If I set up one stall with price p, then Alice buys floor(n / p) jewels.

To make floor(n / p) = k, p must satisfy ceil(n / k) <= p <= floor(n / (k - 1)).

Wait, let's think about it.

If floor(n / p) = k, then k <= n / p < k + 1.

So, n / (k + 1) < p <= n / k.

Therefore, p should be in (n / (k + 1), n / k].

But p must be an integer, so p can be ceil(n / (k + 1)) + 1 to floor(n / k).

So, if there exists an integer p in that range, then setting up one stall with that p would make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But in the first example, n=7, k=3.

So, p should be in (7 / 4, 7 / 3], which is (1.75, 2.333]. So, p=2.

Indeed, with p=2, floor(7 / 2)=3, which matches k=3.

In the second example, n=6, k=4.

p should be in (6 / 5, 6 / 4], which is (1.2, 1.5]. There is no integer p in this range.

Hence, it's impossible with one stall.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls.

So, maybe I need to set up multiple stalls to achieve the total of k jewels.

Let me consider setting up two stalls.

In the first stall, Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels, spends floor(n / p1) * p1 coins, and is left with n - floor(n / p1) * p1 coins.

Then, in the second stall, she buys floor(remaining / p2) jewels.

And so on, up to s stalls, with s <= 60.

I need the sum of jewels bought at each stall to be exactly k.

This seems too general, but maybe I can find a pattern or a way to decompose k into parts that can be achieved with the given n and p_i's.

Let me consider that after the first stall, Alice has some remaining coins, and then in the second stall, she buys some more jewels, and so on.

I need to make sure that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal number of stalls required to achieve k jewels.

Wait, but the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so I don't need to minimize s, just find any s <= 60 that works.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up s stalls where s <= k, since she needs to buy k jewels.

But k can be up to 10^18, and s is at most 60, so that's fine.

Wait, but s can be up to 60, which is much smaller than k in some cases.

I need to find a way to make the sum of floor(n / p_i) over s stalls equal to k.

This seems difficult to handle directly.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If n < k, it's impossible.

- If n == k, set up one stall with p=1, so she buys n coins / 1 = k jewels.

- If n > k, try to set up stalls in a way that the total jewels bought is k.

But how?

Looking back at the first example, they set up 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11.

In this case, Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall and is left with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy any jewels from the remaining stalls.

So, total jewels bought is 3, which matches k=3.

In the third example, they set up 8 stalls with prices that are powers of 2, and Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

So, in both cases, the total jewels bought is k.

But in the first example, they could have set up just one stall with p=2, and Alice would buy 3 jewels, which is k=3.

But in the program, they set up 10 stalls, which is still valid, since s <= 60.

So, perhaps in the case where n >= k, and k - 1 < n - k + 1, set up two stalls: one with p = n - k + 1, and one with p = 1.

Wait, let's see.

In the first example, n=7, k=3.

So, k - 1 = 2, and n - k + 1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5.

Is 2 < 5? Yes.

So, set up two stalls: p1 = 5, p2 = 1.

Let's see:

- At stall 1, p=5: floor(7/5)=1 jewel, spends 5 coins, left with 2 coins.

- At stall 2, p=1: floor(2/1)=2 jewels, spends 2 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3.

So, this is another valid solution.

In the second example, n=6, k=4.

k - 1 = 3, n - k + 1 = 6 - 4 + 1 = 3.

Is 3 < 3? No, 3 is not less than 3.

So, output "NO", which matches the sample output.

In the third example, n=255, k=8.

They set up 8 stalls with p=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a better way, but this works.

So, the program seems to follow this logic:

- If n < k: NO

- If n == k: YES, with one stall p=1

- If k - 1 < n - k + 1: YES, with two stalls p1 = n - k + 1, p2 = 1

- Else: NO

But in the third example, they set up 8 stalls, which is more than 2, but according to the program, it would set up only two stalls if k - 1 < n - k + 1.

But in the third example, k=8, n=255.

k - 1 = 7, n - k + 1 = 255 - 8 + 1 = 248.

Is 7 < 248? Yes.

So, according to the program, it should output YES with two stalls: p1 = 248, p2 = 1.

Let's see if this works.

- At stall 1, p=248: floor(255/248)=1 jewel, spends 248 coins, left with 7 coins.

- At stall 2, p=1: floor(7/1)=7 jewels, spends 7 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k=8.

So, this is another valid solution.

But in the sample output, they set up 8 stalls with p=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

Both approaches work, but the program chooses to set up only two stalls.

So, it's acceptable to set up fewer than 60 stalls, as long as s <= 60.

Therefore, the program seems to be correct based on the sample inputs and outputs.

But I need to make sure that this logic is always correct.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=10, k=4.

k - 1 = 3, n - k + 1 = 10 - 4 + 1 = 7.

Is 3 < 7? Yes.

So, set up two stalls: p1=7, p2=1.

- Stall 1: floor(10/7)=1 jewel, spends 7 coins, left with 3 coins.

- Stall 2: floor(3/1)=3 jewels, spends 3 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 3 = 4, which matches k=4.

Good.

Another example: n=5, k=2.

k - 1 =1, n - k +1=5-2+1=4.

Is 1 < 4? Yes.

Set up two stalls: p1=4, p2=1.

- Stall 1: floor(5/4)=1 jewel, spends 4 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Stall 2: floor(1/1)=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k=2.

Good.

Another example where k - 1 >= n - k +1.

Suppose n=5, k=3.

k -1=2, n -k +1=5-3+1=3.

Is 2 < 3? No.

So, output "NO".

But let's see if it's possible.

- If s=1: find p such that floor(5/p)=3.

p needs to be in (5/4, 5/3], which is (1.25, 1.666]. No integer p in this range.

- If s=2:

Option 1: p1=2, p2=1.

- Stall 1: floor(5/2)=2 jewels, spends 4 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Stall 2: floor(1/1)=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 2 + 1 = 3, which matches k=3.

So, it's possible, but according to the program, it would output "NO" because k -1 >= n -k +1.

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the program, if k -1 >= n -k +1, it outputs "NO".

But in this example, it's possible to set up two stalls to achieve k=3.

So, the program is wrong in this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
