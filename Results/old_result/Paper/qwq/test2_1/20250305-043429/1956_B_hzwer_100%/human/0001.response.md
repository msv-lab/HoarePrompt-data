Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice. Me and Nene each get n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, and we get a point if the card we play has a number that's already on the table.

The problem is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get if both me and Nene play optimally, with Nene trying to maximize her score and minimize mine.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics properly. There are 2n turns, with me and Nene alternating, starting with me. Each turn, the player chooses one of their cards, plays it on the table, and gets a point if that number is already on the table.

Since Nene is very smart, she'll play in a way that maximizes her score and minimizes mine, in that order. So, I need to consider her optimal strategy when deciding my moves.

Let me think about the example given:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

In the first test case, n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,3. So, Nene must have the other 1,2,3, and a 4,4 since each number appears twice.

The explanation says that in one possible sequence, I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 1 (and get a point because 1 is already on the table), Nene plays 4, I play 2, Nene plays 2 and gets a point, I play 3, Nene plays 3 and gets a point. So, I end up with 1 point.

It also says that it's the maximum I can get if Nene plays optimally.

I need to generalize this to any n and any distribution of my cards.

Let me think about what determines whether I get a point or not.

I get a point if, when I play a card, its number is already on the table.

So, to maximize my points, I want to play cards that have their pairs already on the table.

But, Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize mine, so she'll play in a way that maximizes her points and, secondarily, minimizes mine.

I need to model their strategies.

First, let's consider that the game is fully deterministic because all moves are based on the current state and the players' strategies.

I need to find a way to simulate this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n across all test cases up to 2*10^5.

That means I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Looking at the sample input and output:

In the first test case, n=4, my cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

I played 1, Nene played 4, I played 1 (got a point), Nene played 4, I played 2, Nene played 2 (got a point), I played 3, Nene played 3 (got a point).

So, I have 1 point, Nene has 3 points.

In the second test case, n=8, my cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards: the remaining numbers.

I need to maximize my points assuming Nene plays optimally.

The output is 2, meaning I can get at most 2 points.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=8, my cards:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Nene's cards: the other numbers.

Output is 1.

In the fourth test case, n=3, my cards:1,2,3

Nene's cards:1,2,3

Output is 0.

In the fifth test case, n=1, my cards:1

Nene's cards:1

Output is 0.

From these examples, it seems that having multiple cards of the same number affects the scoring.

Let me think about the frequencies of each number in my hand.

Letâ€™s define freq[i] as the number of times I have card i in my hand.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck, Nene has 2 - freq[i] cards of number i.

So, for each number i:

- If freq[i] == 0: Nene has both cards.

- If freq[i] == 1: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- If freq[i] == 2: I have both cards, Nene has none.

Now, the game proceeds with me and Nene playing n turns each, alternating, starting with me.

I need to choose which card to play on my turn, and Nene will choose optimally on her turn.

The scoring depends on whether the number being played is already on the table.

I need to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal play to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems complex. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

- In the first test case, n=4, my cards:1,1,2,3

- freq:1->2,2->1,3->1,4->0

- Output:1

- In the second test case, n=8, my cards:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

- freq:1->1,2->1,4->1,5->2,7->1,8->2,3->0,6->0

- Output:2

- In the third test case, n=8, my cards:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

- freq:1->1,2->1,3->1,4->2,5->1,6->1,7->1,8->0

- Output:1

- In the fourth test case, n=3, my cards:1,2,3

- freq:1->1,2->1,3->1

- Output:0

- In the fifth test case, n=1, my cards:1

- freq:1->1

- Output:0

Looking at these, it seems that the output is related to the number of numbers that I have two cards of.

In the first test case, I have two 1's, and the output is 1.

In the second test case, I have two 8's and two 5's, and the output is 2.

In the third test case, I have two 4's, and the output is 1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, I have no numbers with two cards, and the output is 0.

This suggests that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers that I have two cards of.

But wait, in the first test case, I have two 1's, and the output is 1, not 2.

In the second test case, I have two 8's and two 5's, and the output is 2.

In the third test case, I have two 4's, and the output is 1.

Hmm, inconsistency here.

Wait, maybe it's the minimum of the number of pairs I have and the number of turns I have.

But in the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), and the output is 1.

In the second test case, I have two pairs (two 8's and two 5's), and the output is 2.

In the third test case, I have one pair (two 4's), and the output is 1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, I have no pairs, and the output is 0.

This seems to hold.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers that I have two cards of.

But in the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), and the output is 1.

In the second test case, two pairs, output is 2.

In the third test case, one pair, output is 1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, no pairs, output is 0.

This seems to match.

But wait, if that's the case, why in the first test case, Nene scored 3 points, and I scored 1 point.

Wait, maybe I need to consider how Nene plays.

Let me think differently.

Each pair of identical cards can potentially give one point to the player who plays the second card, provided that the first card was already on the table.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of times I can play the second card of a pair.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, she will try to play pairs in a way that minimizes my opportunities to play the second card of my pairs.

Wait, perhaps it's about controlling the availability of numbers on the table.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have two cards of a certain number. If I play one, and Nene doesn't play the same number, then when I play the second one, I get a point.

But if Nene plays the same number before I play the second one, then she gets a point, and I don't.

So, Nene will try to play numbers that I have two of, to prevent me from getting points.

Wait, but Nene is trying to maximize her score first, and minimize mine second.

So, she'll prioritize playing pairs to get points, but also try to deny me points.

But in reality, since she has to play n cards, and I have n cards, and we alternate turns, starting with me, it's a bit tricky.

Let me try to model this.

Let's consider that the game progresses in 2n turns, with me and Nene alternating, starting with me.

At each turn, the player chooses a card to play, and gets a point if the number is already on the table.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and, in case of ties, minimize mine.

I need to play optimally to maximize my points.

This seems like a zero-sum game, but with a specific scoring rule.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph or use some combinatorial approach.

Another way to think about it is to consider the dependencies between the cards.

Each pair of identical cards can be seen as a unit that can give a point to the player who plays the second one.

But with the interleaving turns, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the frequencies.

Let freq[i] be the number of cards I have for number i.

Nene has (2 - freq[i]) cards for number i.

I need to maximize the number of times I play the second card of a pair.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of which pairs I control (i.e., I have both cards) versus which pairs are split between me and Nene.

If I have both cards of a number, then I can guarantee that I play the second one and get a point, provided that the first one is played before the second.

But, Nene can interfere by playing cards in a way that affects when I can play my cards.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of pairs I have.

If I have k pairs (i.e., numbers where freq[i] == 2), then I can potentially get k points.

But in the first test case, k=1 (number 1), and the output is 1.

In the second test case, k=2 (numbers 5 and 8), and the output is 2.

In the third test case, k=1 (number 4), and the output is 1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, k=0, and the output is 0.

This seems to hold.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

But wait, in the first test case, it matches, but in the explanation, it's mentioned that Nene can play in a way that maximizes her score and minimizes mine.

But according to this simple count, it seems to work.

Is there any case where having both cards of a number doesn't translate to getting a point?

Let me think.

Suppose I have both cards of number A, and Nene has both cards of number B.

If I play A first, then Nene plays B, then I play A second and get a point, Nene plays B second and gets a point.

So, both get one point each.

But in reality, Nene can choose to play her cards in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

Wait, but in this scenario, she has no choice; she plays her cards, and I play mine.

But perhaps in more complex scenarios, her choice of order can affect my ability to get points.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=3, my cards are 1,1,2, Nene's cards are 2,3,3.

If I play 1, Nene can play 2, then I play 1 and get a point, Nene plays 3, I play 2 and get a point, Nene plays 3 and gets a point.

So, I get 2 points.

But wait, Nene might play optimally to maximize her points.

Alternatively, if Nene plays 3 first, then I play 1, Nene plays 3 and gets a point, I play 1, get a point, play 1 second and get a point.

Wait, but Nene would prefer to play 2 first to deny me a point.

Wait, let's see:

Option 1:

I play 1, Nene plays 2, I play 1 and get a point, Nene plays 3, I play 2 and get a point, Nene plays 3 and gets a point.

I have 2 points, Nene has 2 points.

Option 2:

I play 1, Nene plays 3, I play 1 and get a point, Nene plays 3 and gets a point, I play 2, Nene plays 2, I get no point.

I have 1 point, Nene has 2 points.

In this case, Nene can choose to play 3 first, which leads to me getting only 1 point.

But according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score first and then minimize mine.

In the first option, she gets 2 points, and I get 2 points.

In the second option, she gets 2 points and I get 1 point.

So, she would prefer the second option because it minimizes my score while maximizing hers.

Hence, in this case, I can get at most 1 point.

But according to my earlier hypothesis, since I have one pair (two 1's), I should be able to get one point.

But in the first option, I got two points.

So, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Nene can interfere with my pairs by playing cards in a way that denies me points.

So, maybe the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, but Nene can reduce it by playing certain cards at certain times.

In the above example, I have two 1's, which is one pair.

In the first option, I get two points, which seems higher than the pair count.

But perhaps that's because of the way Nene plays.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that for each pair I have, I can get at most one point, but Nene can prevent me from getting that point by playing cards in a certain order.

But in the first test case, I got one point for one pair, which matches.

In the second test case, I have two pairs, and I got two points.

In the third test case, I have one pair, and I got one point.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, I have no pairs, and I got zero points.

So, perhaps, in general, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, assuming Nene plays optimally to minimize my points.

Wait, but in the example I just thought of, with n=3, my cards:1,1,2; Nene's cards:2,3,3.

In this case, I have one pair (two 1's), but depending on how Nene plays, I can get either one or two points.

But according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in this case, she would play in a way that I get only one point.

Hence, the maximum I can get is one point, which matches the number of pairs I have.

So, perhaps the general rule is that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=4, my cards:1,1,2,2.

Nene's cards:3,3,4,4.

In this case, I have two pairs: two 1's and two 2's.

Nene has two pairs: two 3's and two 4's.

If I play 1, Nene plays 3, I play 1 and get a point, Nene plays 3 and gets a point.

Then, I play 2, Nene plays 4, I play 2 and get a point, Nene plays 4 and gets a point.

So, I get two points, Nene gets two points.

Alternatively, Nene could play 3 first, then I play 1, Nene plays 3 and gets a point, I play 1 and get a point, play 2, Nene plays 4, play 2 and get a point, Nene plays 4 and gets a point.

Again, I get two points.

It seems that, in this case, I can get two points, which matches the number of pairs I have.

Another example: n=5, my cards:1,1,2,3,4.

Nene's cards:2,3,4,5,5.

I have one pair (two 1's), and Nene has one pair (two 5's).

Depending on how Nene plays, she can try to minimize my points.

If I play 1 first, Nene plays 2, I play 1 and get a point, Nene plays 3, I play 4, Nene plays 5, I play nothing, Nene plays 5 and gets a point.

So, I get one point, Nene gets one point.

Alternatively, if Nene plays 5 first, I play 1, Nene plays 5 and gets a point, I play 1 and get a point, play 2, Nene plays 3, play 4.

So, again, I get one point.

So, in this case, I can get one point, which matches the number of pairs I have.

Hence, it seems that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

Wait, but in the earlier example where n=3, my cards:1,1,2; Nene's cards:2,3,3.

In that case, I have one pair, and Nene has one pair.

Depending on how Nene plays, I can get one or two points.

But according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, she would choose to play in a way that I get only one point.

Hence, the maximum I can get is one point, which matches the number of pairs I have.

So, perhaps the rule is that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

Thus, the answer should be the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

In the code provided, it seems to implement this logic.

The code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the list of cards I have.

It then counts the frequency of each number in my hand.

Finally, for each number, it adds max(0, x - 1) to the answer, where x is the frequency of that number.

Wait, max(0, x - 1).

So, for each number that appears twice, x=2, so x-1=1, which adds 1 to the answer.

For numbers that appear once, x=1, so x-1=0, which adds 0.

Hence, the total answer is equal to the number of pairs I have.

This matches the observations from the examples and the test cases.

Therefore, the code seems correct.

Hence, the answer is True.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points you can get in a card game where you and Nene alternately play cards and score points based on whether the card played is already on the table. Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, we need to compute your optimal score.

### Approach

1. **Frequency Counting**:
    - Count how many times each number appears in your hand. Since each number can appear up to twice, this frequency will help determine potential points.
  
2. **Points Calculation**:
    - For each number that appears twice in your hand, you can get one point. This is because you can play the first card, and then play the second card to score a point (since the first card is already on the table).
    - Numbers that appear only once cannot give you an additional point as you don't have a pair to play.

3. **Optimal Play**:
    - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, since you control when to play your pairs, the calculation simplifies to counting the number of pairs you have.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        ans = 0
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
    - Read the number of test cases.
    - For each test case, read the value of `n` and the list of integers in your hand.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
    - Use a list `cnt` to count the frequency of each integer from 1 to n in your hand.

3. **Calculating Points**:
    - For each integer, if it appears twice in your hand (`x == 2`), you can score one point. This is achieved by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to the answer for each frequency count.

4. **Output**:
    - Print the computed answer for each test case, which represents the maximum points you can get.

This approach ensures that you maximize your score given Nene's optimal play by simply counting the number of pairs you hold.
