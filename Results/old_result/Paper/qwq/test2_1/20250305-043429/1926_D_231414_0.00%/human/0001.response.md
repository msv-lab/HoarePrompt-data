Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers doesn't have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bits should be different.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. Essentially, for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations should differ in all the first 31 bits. That sounds a lot like saying that no two numbers in the same group should have any bit in common in those 31 bits.

Wait, but that can't be right because if they differ in all bits, that means for each bit position, one number has 0 and the other has 1, or vice versa. So, it's like they are complements of each other in those bits.

But actually, no. If two numbers differ in all bits, it means that for each bit, they have different values. So, it's not exactly being complements, because complements would mean that one is the bitwise NOT of the other.

Let me think about this again. If two numbers differ in all bits from 1 to 31, that means for each bit position from 1 to 31, one number has a 0 and the other has a 1, and vice versa. So, indeed, they are complements in those bits.

Given that, the problem is asking to group numbers such that in each group, any two numbers are complements in the first 31 bits.

Wait, but that can't be right because if two numbers are complements in all 31 bits, then they are unique in that group because any other number would either match or not match with one of them.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition. Let's look back at the problem statement.

It says: "any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit."

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values are not equal. That means, for each bit position, the bits are different.

Wait, that sounds like for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise AND should be zero for bits 1 to 31.

No, actually, it's stronger than that. It's not just that their bitwise AND is zero, but that for every bit, they differ.

Wait, no. If two numbers have different bits in all positions from 1 to 31, that means that their XOR in those bits is all 1's. Because XOR is 1 when bits differ.

So, if two numbers differ in all bits from 1 to 31, their XOR for those bits is all 1's.

But the problem says that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit.

Wait, re-reading: "for all 1 ≤ i < 32, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i)"

So, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, for every bit position i from 1 to 31, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i).

That means, for any two numbers in the same group, their bits differ in all positions from 1 to 31.

That's a very strong condition. It means that no two numbers in the same group can have the same bit in any of the first 31 positions.

Given that, it seems like each group can have at most one number, because any two numbers would inevitably have at least one bit in common in those 31 positions.

Wait, but the example given has a case where two numbers can be in the same group. In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are placed in the same group. Let's see why.

2147483647 is binary 111...111 (31 ones), and 0 is binary 000...000. So, for every bit position from 1 to 31, 0 has 0 and 2147483647 has 1, so they differ in all bits. Therefore, they can be in the same group.

So, in that case, it's allowed because they differ in all bits.

So, the condition is that in a group, any two numbers differ in all bits from 1 to 31.

So, more generally, numbers can be in the same group if they are pairwise differing in all bits from 1 to 31.

Wait, but in the first test case, the numbers are 1, 4, 3, 4. Let's look at their binary representations:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

So, for example, 1 and 4 differ in bits 1, 2, and 3.

1 and 3 differ in bit 2.

Wait, but according to the condition, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits should differ.

In this case, 1 and 3 in binary are:

1: 001

3: 011

They have the same bit in position 1 (least significant bit).

Therefore, 1 and 3 cannot be in the same group because they have at least one bit in common.

Similarly, 4 and 4 are the same number, so they have all bits the same, so they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, each number needs to be in its own group, which is why the output for the first test case is 4.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 differ in all bits, so they can be in the same group.

So, the problem is to group numbers such that any two numbers in the same group differ in all bits from 1 to 31.

Wait, but in the first test case, 1 and 4 differ in all bits, but 1 and 3 do not.

Wait, let's look again.

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

So, 1 and 4 differ in all bits:

bit 1: 1 vs 0

bit 2: 0 vs 0

Wait, no, 1 is 001, 4 is 100.

Wait, in 1, bit 1 is 1, bit 2 is 0, bit 3 is 0.

In 4, bit 1 is 0, bit 2 is 0, bit 3 is 1.

So, they differ in bit 1 (1 vs 0) and bit 3 (0 vs 1), but agree in bit 2 (both 0).

Wait, but the problem says "for all 1 ≤ i < 32, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i)", meaning that for every bit position, the bits must be different.

So, in this case, since 1 and 4 have bit 2 the same, they cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, 1 and 3:

1: 001

3: 011

They have bit 1 and bit 2 different, but bit 3 is the same (both have bit 3 as 0).

Wait, no, 1 is 001 (assuming 3 bits), 3 is 011.

So, bit 1: 1 vs 1 (same)

bit 2: 0 vs 1 (different)

bit 3: 0 vs 0 (same)

So, they have bit 1 and bit 3 the same, so they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, in the first test case, no two numbers can be in the same group, so we need 4 groups.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 differ in all bits, so they can be in the same group.

So, the task is to find the minimum number of groups such that in each group, any two numbers differ in all bits from 1 to 31.

Wait, but in the first test case, it's not possible to have any two numbers in the same group, so we need as many groups as there are numbers.

In the second test case, since 0 and 2147483647 differ in all bits, they can be in the same group.

So, I need a way to group numbers where any two numbers in the same group differ in all bits from 1 to 31.

This seems related to some kind of graph problem, where numbers are nodes, and edges connect numbers that can be in the same group.

But that might not be efficient given the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of complements.

If I have a number x, then the only number that can be in the same group as x is its complement, where each bit is flipped.

But in the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are complements, since 0 is 000...000 and 2147483647 is 111...111.

So, for each number x, its complement is ~x & check, where check is a mask with the first 31 bits set to 1.

Wait, in Python, ~x is the bitwise NOT of x, which flips all bits.

But since integers can have more than 31 bits, we need to consider only the first 31 bits.

So, perhaps we should consider x and (~x) & check as a pair, where check is (1 << 31) - 1.

Then, x and its complement can be in the same group.

Moreover, since the problem allows each number to be in exactly one group, and we want to minimize the number of groups, we should try to pair each number with its complement if possible.

So, for each number x, if its complement (~x & check) is present in the list, they can be in the same group.

Otherwise, x needs its own group.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers, group each x with its complement if present, and count the number of such pairs and the number of unpaired elements.

But wait, in the first test case, all numbers are 1, 4, 3, 4.

Let's compute their complements:

Assuming check = (1 << 31) - 1.

So, check is 2147483647.

Then, complement of 1 is (~1) & check = (all bits flipped except the highest bit) & check.

Wait, in Python, integers are signed, but we need to treat them as unsigned.

Perhaps it's better to use bitwise operations carefully.

Alternatively, I can compute the complement as check - x.

Because x + (~x & check) = check.

So, (~x & check) = check - x.

Therefore, complement of x is check - x.

So, for each x, its complement is check - x.

Then, I can try to pair each x with check - x.

If x and check - x are both present, they can be in the same group.

If x is present but check - x is not, then x needs its own group.

So, I can count the frequency of each x, and for each x, if check - x is present, pair them together, reducing the group count.

Wait, but I need to make sure that each pair is in a separate group, because if I have multiple pairs, they might not be compatible with each other.

Wait, no, actually, if x and check - x are in a group, and y and check - y are in another group, as long as x != y and x != check - y, etc., they can be in separate groups.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of graph coloring, where each number is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if they cannot be in the same group.

Then, the minimum number of groups is the chromatic number of the graph.

But with n up to 2e5, that's not feasible.

So, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the first 31 bits as defining a graph where each bit position is a dimension.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the first 31 bits of each number.

The condition requires that for any two numbers in the same group, their bit patterns in these 31 bits are completely different.

That is, for any two numbers in the same group, for each of the 31 bits, their bits are different.

This sounds similar to error-correcting codes, where codewords differ in many bits.

But I need a way to group the numbers such that this condition is satisfied.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of maximal matching.

If I can pair numbers that are complements, then those pairs can be in one group.

But in the first test case, no two numbers can be paired because they don't satisfy the condition.

Wait, but in the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because they are complements.

So, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of singleton elements plus half the number of paired elements.

But I need to minimize the number of groups.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to finding the number of independent sets in some graph, but again, that seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the properties of the numbers and their complements.

Let me consider that for each number x, its complement is check - x, where check is (1 << 31) - 1.

So, for each x, its complement is check - x.

Now, if x and check - x are both present, they can be in the same group.

If x is present and check - x is not, then x needs its own group.

So, perhaps I can count the frequency of each x, and for each x, if check - x is present, pair them together, reducing the group count.

Wait, but I need to make sure that pairing x with check - x doesn't conflict with other pairings.

Wait, actually, since x and check - x can be in the same group, and this group can only contain these two, then the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of singleton x's plus the number of pairs.

But I need to minimize the number of groups, so I should maximize the number of pairs.

So, for each x, if check - x is present and hasn't been paired yet, pair them together.

Otherwise, x needs its own group.

This seems reasonable.

So, I can create a frequency dictionary for the numbers.

Then, iterate through the numbers, and for each x, if check - x is present and hasn't been assigned to a group yet, pair them together and decrement the frequencies accordingly.

Otherwise, assign x to its own group.

Wait, but I need to make sure that each pair is in a separate group.

Wait, no, actually, all paired x and check - x can be in the same group.

Wait, but the problem says that in any group, any two numbers must differ in all bits from 1 to 31.

But x and check - x differ in all bits, so they can be in the same group.

Moreover, if I have multiple such pairs, can they be in the same group?

Wait, no, because if I have x1 and check - x1 in a group, and x2 and check - x2 in the same group, then x1 and x2 may not differ in all bits.

Wait, for example, in the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because they differ in all bits.

If there were another pair, say 1 and (check -1), they also differ in all bits.

But if I put all four in the same group, then 0 and 1 have some bits the same, so they don't satisfy the condition.

Therefore, each group can contain at most one pair of x and check - x.

Wait, but actually, in the group containing x and check - x, any two numbers must differ in all bits.

But x and check - x differ in all bits, and check - x and x differ in all bits.

So, that's fine.

But if I add a third number y to the group, then y must differ from both x and check - x in all bits.

Which may not be possible unless y is something else.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs needed plus the number of unpaired elements.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to matching in a graph, where each x is connected to its complement.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that each group can contain at most one pair of x and check - x.

And any unpaired x needs its own group.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs plus the number of unpaired elements.

Wait, but in the second test case, there is one pair (0 and 2147483647), so one group.

In the first test case, no pairs, so four groups.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but in the third test case, with five numbers, perhaps some can be paired and others can't.

Wait, I need to generalize this.

So, my plan is:

1. Create a frequency dictionary for the numbers.

2. Initialize check = (1 << 31) - 1.

3. For each x in the frequency dictionary:

a. If frequency[x] > 0 and frequency[check - x] > 0:

i. Pair x and check - x.

ii. Decrement frequency[x] and frequency[check - x].

iii. Assign them to a group.

b. Else, if frequency[x] > 0:

i. Assign x to its own group.

4. The minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs plus the number of unpaired elements.

Wait, but in step 3a, I need to make sure that x and check - x are different elements.

Wait, if x == check - x, then x is its own complement.

Wait, is that possible?

Let's see.

x == check - x implies 2x == check, so x == check / 2.

But check is (1 << 31) - 1, which is odd, so x would not be an integer.

Wait, (1 << 31) - 1 is odd, so check / 2 is not an integer.

But x is an integer, so x == check - x is not possible.

Therefore, x and check - x are always different.

Hence, I can safely pair them without worrying about x == check - x.

So, proceeding with this plan.

Now, considering the constraints, n can be up to 2e5, and t is up to 1e4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5.

So, I need an efficient implementation.

Using a dictionary to count frequencies is acceptable.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

times = int(input())

check = 2 ** 31 - 1

for _ in range(times):

n = int(input())

data = list(map(int, input().split()))

dic = dict()

ans = n

check = 2 ** 31 - 1

for i in data:

s = i ^ check

if s in dic:

dic[s] -= 1

if dic[s] == 0:

del dic[s]

ans -= 1

elif i in dic:

dic[i] += 1

else:

dic[i] = 1

print(ans)

So, in this program, for each test case, it reads n and the list of numbers.

Then, it initializes a dictionary dic and sets ans = n.

For each number i in data:

s = i ^ check, which is equivalent to s = check - i, since check is (1 << 31) - 1.

Then, it checks if s is in dic.

If s is in dic, it decrements dic[s].

If dic[s] reaches 0, it deletes s from dic.

And decreases ans by 1.

Else, if i is in dic, it increments dic[i].

Else, it sets dic[i] = 1.

Finally, it prints ans.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought of pairing x and check - x together in one group.

So, for each x and check - x, they can be in the same group, reducing the number of groups by one.

So, initially, ans = n, meaning each number is in its own group.

Then, for each pair of x and check - x, I can reduce ans by one, because they can share a group.

So, the minimal number of groups is ans after processing all pairs.

In the given code, for each i, it computes s = i ^ check, which is check - i.

Then, if s is in dic, it means that s has been seen before, so it can be paired with i.

Wait, no.

Wait, if s is in dic, it means that s has been seen before, and now i is the complement of s.

So, by pairing i and s together, they can be in the same group.

Hence, ans can be decreased by one, because instead of having two groups (one for s and one for i), they can share one group.

Therefore, ans -= 1.

If s is not in dic, then it adds i to dic or increments its count.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought of frequency counting.

But in this code, it seems to be tracking the presence of complements.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to understand the code's logic.

It initializes ans = n, assuming each number is in its own group.

For each number i in data:

s = i ^ check, which is the complement of i.

If s is in dic, it means that s has been seen before, so there is a number s that can be paired with i.

Hence, ans -= 1, because now s and i can be in the same group.

Then, dic[s] -= 1.

If dic[s] == 0, del dic[s].

Else, if i is in dic, increment dic[i].

Else, set dic[i] = 1.

Wait, but this seems to have a flaw.

Suppose s is in dic.

Then, ans -= 1, and dic[s] -= 1.

If dic[s] == 0, delete s from dic.

This suggests that it's tracking the frequency of s.

Similarly, if s is not in dic, and i is in dic, it increments dic[i].

Else, sets dic[i] = 1.

Wait, but in this logic, dic seems to be counting the frequency of i.

But when s is in dic, it pairs i with s, reduces ans by one, and decrements dic[s].

But dic[s] represents the frequency of s.

Wait, perhaps the logic is that if s is present in dic with frequency > 0, then pair i with s, reduce their frequencies, and reduce ans by one.

Otherwise, increment the frequency of i.

Wait, but in the code, it doesn't seem to decrement dic[i].

Wait, perhaps I need to look at it differently.

Let's consider an example.

Take the first test case:

4

1 4 3 4

check = 2**31 -1

s = i ^ check

So, for i=1, s = 1 ^ check

For i=4, s = 4 ^ check

For i=3, s = 3 ^ check

For i=4, s = 4 ^ check

Now, dic is initially empty.

For i=1:

s = 1 ^ check

s not in dic, and i not in dic, so dic[1] =1

For i=4:

s =4 ^ check

s not in dic, and 4 not in dic, so dic[4]=1

For i=3:

s=3^check

s not in dic, and 3 not in dic, so dic[3]=1

For i=4:

s=4^check

s is already in dic (from previous i=4), so dic[s] -=1, ans -=1.

Now, ans =4-1=3

Then, dic[s] ==0, so del dic[s]

So, ans=3

But according to the problem, the answer should be 4, not 3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the first test case, the output is 4.

But according to this code, ans would be 3, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps I need to look again.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, data=[1,4,3,4]

Processing:

i=1: s=1^check, not in dic, dic[1]=1, ans=4

i=4: s=4^check, not in dic, dic[4]=1, ans=4

i=3: s=3^check, not in dic, dic[3]=1, ans=4

i=4: s=4^check, which is in dic, so dic[s]-=1, ans=4-1=3, dic[s]==0, del dic[s]

So, ans=3, but the correct answer is 4.

So, this code is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but in the problem's example, the first test case has output 4, but according to this code, it would output 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says "the minimal number of groups", and in the first test case, it's 4, meaning each number needs its own group.

But according to this code, it's outputting 3.

So, it's wrong.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
