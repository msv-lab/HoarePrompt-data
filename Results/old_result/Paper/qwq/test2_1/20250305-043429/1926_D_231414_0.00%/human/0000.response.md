Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bits should be different.

First, I need to understand this condition clearly. So, if I have two numbers, say x and y, in the same group, then for every bit position i from 1 to 31, the i-th bit of x should not be equal to the i-th bit of y. In other words, for all i from 1 to 31, x_2(i) != y_2(i).

This sounds a lot like the concept of bitwise operations. Specifically, it seems related to bitwise XOR. Because XOR of two bits is 0 if they are the same and 1 if they are different. So, if x and y differ in all 31 bits, then x XOR y should have all 31 bits set to 1.

Wait, actually, no. If x and y differ in all 31 bits, then x XOR y should be all 1's in those 31 bits. So, x XOR y should be equal to a number where the first 31 bits are all 1's, which is (2^31 - 1).

So, for any two numbers in the same group, x XOR y should be equal to (2^31 - 1), meaning they differ in all 31 bits.

Wait a second, that can't be right. Let's think about this again.

If x and y differ in all 31 bits, then x XOR y should indeed be a number with all 31 bits set to 1, which is (2^31 - 1). But the condition is that for any pair of numbers in the same group, they differ in all 31 bits. That seems very restrictive.

But looking back at the problem statement, it says "any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit". So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values should be different.

Wait, but in binary, if two bits are different, that means one is 0 and the other is 1. So, for two numbers to differ in all 31 bits, their XOR should indeed be (2^31 - 1), as that's a number with all 31 bits set to 1.

But let's consider an example. Suppose n=2, and the numbers are 0 and (2^31 - 1). Then, 0 XOR (2^31 - 1) = (2^31 - 1), which means they differ in all 31 bits. So, they can be in the same group.

Another example: n=2, numbers are 0 and 1. 0 XOR 1 = 1, which is not equal to (2^31 - 1), so they don't differ in all 31 bits. Wait, but 0 and 1 differ only in the least significant bit, and have the other 30 bits the same (both 0). So, they have matching bits in bits 2 through 31. Therefore, they cannot be in the same group.

Wait, but according to the problem, in any group, any pair of numbers should not have matching bit values among bits from 1 to 31. So, for 0 and 1, they have matching bits in bits 2 through 31, which means they cannot be in the same group.

So, the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits should be different. That is, x XOR y should be equal to (2^31 - 1).

So, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of groups such that in each group, any two numbers have XOR equal to (2^31 - 1).

This seems similar to graph coloring, where each number is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if their XOR is not equal to (2^31 - 1). Then, the minimum number of groups is the chromatic number of this graph.

But building such a graph is not feasible for n up to 2*10^5, as it would require O(n^2) time and space.

So, I need a smarter way to find the minimum number of groups.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. If I have three numbers a, b, and c, and a XOR b = (2^31 - 1), and a XOR c = (2^31 - 1), then b XOR c should be zero, because (a XOR b) XOR (a XOR c) = b XOR c = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So, if a XOR b = (2^31 - 1) and a XOR c = (2^31 - 1), then b XOR c = 0, which means b = c.

So, in a group, if a is in the group, then the only other number that can be in the group with a is a XOR (2^31 - 1).

Wait, is that right? Because if b = a XOR (2^31 - 1), then a XOR b = (2^31 - 1), which satisfies the condition.

And if we try to add a third number c to the group, c must differ from both a and b in all 31 bits.

But since b = a XOR (2^31 - 1), and c must differ from both a and b, then c must be equal to a XOR (2^31 - 1) XOR (2^31 - 1) = a.

But a is already in the group, and c must be different from a, so c cannot be added to the group.

Therefore, each group can have at most two numbers: a and a XOR (2^31 - 1).

Wait, but it's possible that a XOR (2^31 - 1) is not present in the list, so a can be in a group alone.

So, the idea is to pair numbers that differ in all 31 bits, i.e., their XOR is (2^31 - 1).

So, the minimum number of groups is equal to the number of pairs plus the number of unpaired numbers.

But wait, no. Because if I have multiple pairs that can be grouped together, I can put them in the same group.

Wait, but the condition is that any pair within a group must have XOR equal to (2^31 - 1).

So, if I have a group with a and b, where a XOR b = (2^31 - 1), and c and d, where c XOR d = (2^31 - 1), can I put a, b, c, d in the same group?

Wait, no. Because a XOR c might not be equal to (2^31 - 1).

In fact, from earlier, if a XOR b = (2^31 - 1) and b XOR c = (2^31 - 1), then a XOR c = 0, which is not equal to (2^31 - 1), assuming c != a.

So, in that case, a and c cannot be in the same group.

Therefore, each group can contain at most one pair of numbers that differ in all 31 bits.

Wait, no. More precisely, each group can contain numbers a and b where a XOR b = (2^31 - 1).

But if I have another pair c and d where c XOR d = (2^31 - 1), and a XOR c != (2^31 - 1), then a and c cannot be in the same group.

So, the groups must be such that any two numbers within a group have XOR equal to (2^31 - 1), and across groups, the XOR can be anything.

This seems tricky. It sounds like the problem is to find the maximum number of such pairs, and the remaining unpaired numbers will each need their own group.

Wait, but the goal is to minimize the number of groups.

So, to minimize the number of groups, I need to maximize the number of pairs in each group, but given the constraints, it seems that each group can have only one pair.

Wait, no. Actually, if I have a group with a and b, where a XOR b = (2^31 - 1), and c and d, where c XOR d = (2^31 - 1), and a XOR c != (2^31 - 1), then I cannot put a, b, c, and d in the same group because a XOR c != (2^31 - 1), which violates the condition for a and c.

Therefore, each group can contain only one pair of numbers that differ in all 31 bits.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs plus the number of unpaired numbers.

Wait, but that would mean that the minimal number of groups is ceil(n/2), but that's not necessarily true because some numbers might not have a matching pair.

Wait, no. Because, as we saw earlier, if a group has a and b, where a XOR b = (2^31 - 1), then no other numbers can be added to that group, because any new number c would have to differ from both a and b in all 31 bits, which would imply c = a XOR (2^31 - 1) = b, which is not possible since c != b.

Therefore, each group can contain at most one pair.

So, to minimize the number of groups, I need to maximize the number of such pairs.

Therefore, the minimal number of groups is equal to ceil(n/2), but only if all numbers can be paired in such a way that each pair has XOR equal to (2^31 - 1).

But in reality, it's possible that some numbers cannot be paired, in which case, they will need their own group.

So, I need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair has XOR equal to (2^31 - 1), and the remaining numbers will each need their own group.

Wait, but how do I find such pairs efficiently?

Let me think about it differently.

Let me consider that for each number a, its required pair is b = a XOR (2^31 - 1).

So, for each a, I look for b = a XOR (2^31 - 1) in the list.

If I find b, then I can pair a and b in one group.

Otherwise, a needs its own group.

So, I can iterate through the list, and for each a, check if b = a XOR (2^31 - 1) is present.

If it is, pair them and remove b from the list.

Otherwise, put a in a group by itself.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to do this.

So, I can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number.

Then, iterate through the dictionary, and for each a, check if b = a XOR (2^31 - 1) is present.

If it is, pair them and decrement the counts accordingly.

Otherwise, a needs its own group.

Wait, but I need to make sure that I don't double-count pairs.

So, let's think about it in terms of matching in a graph, where each number is a node, and there is an edge between a and b if a XOR b = (2^31 - 1).

Then, the problem reduces to finding a maximum matching in this graph.

But again, with n up to 2*10^5, building the graph is not feasible.

But, since each node can be matched to at most one other node, this is a matching in a graph with degree at most one.

Wait, no, each node can be matched to at most one other node, but in reality, each node can be matched to only one specific other node, which is b = a XOR (2^31 - 1).

So, it's a matching where each node has exactly one possible match, which is b = a XOR (2^31 - 1).

So, it's like a matching in a graph where each edge is between a and a XOR (2^31 - 1).

In this case, the graph consists of disjoint cycles or paths.

In a cycle of length k, the maximum matching is floor(k/2).

In a path of length k, the maximum matching is floor(k/2).

But in this specific case, since each node has at most one edge, the graph consists of disjoint cycles and paths.

Wait, actually, since each node has exactly one possible match, the graph consists of disjoint cycles.

Because, for each a, its match is b = a XOR (2^31 - 1), and for b, its match is a.

So, each cycle has length 2.

Wait, no. If a XOR b = (2^31 - 1), and b XOR a = (2^31 - 1), so each cycle is of length 2.

Wait, but if a XOR b = (2^31 - 1), and b XOR a = (2^31 - 1), then yes, each cycle is of length 2.

Wait, but in terms of graph, it's a matching where each edge connects a and b = a XOR (2^31 - 1).

So, the graph consists of disjoint edges (i.e., edges without any cycles), because each edge is independent.

Therefore, the maximum matching is simply the number of such edges that can be formed.

So, in other words, the maximum number of pairs is the number of a where count(a) and count(b = a XOR (2^31 - 1)) are both positive, and we can pair them up min(count(a), count(b)) times.

Wait, but since a and b are distinct, we need to ensure that we don't overcount.

Wait, actually, a and b might be the same. Wait, no, a XOR (2^31 - 1) is different from a, because (2^31 - 1) is not zero.

So, a and b are distinct.

Therefore, for each pair (a, b), where b = a XOR (2^31 - 1), and a < b, we can count the number of such pairs.

Wait, actually, a and b are distinct, but it's possible that a XOR (2^31 - 1) = a, but only if (2^31 - 1) is zero, which it's not.

So, a and b are always distinct.

Therefore, in the dictionary, for each a, if b = a XOR (2^31 - 1) is present, then the number of pairs is min(count(a), count(b)).

Then, the total number of pairs is sum over a of min(count(a), count(b)) / 2.

Wait, no, sum over a of min(count(a), count(b)) / 2, but to avoid double-counting, we need to divide by 2.

Alternatively, we can iterate over a, and for each a, add min(count(a), count(b)) to the total number of pairs, and set count(a) = count(b) = 0.

Wait, but to avoid double-counting, we need to make sure that once we pair a and b, we don't count them again.

So, a better way is to iterate through the dictionary, and for each a, if count(a) > 0 and count(b) > 0, then we can form min(count(a), count(b)) pairs, and set count(a) -= min(count(a), count(b)), count(b) -= min(count(a), count(b)).

Wait, but that might not be efficient enough for n up to 2*10^5.

Is there a better way?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I group all numbers into sets where each set contains a and a XOR (2^31 - 1).

Then, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of such sets.

Wait, but how?

Actually, since each a can be paired with b = a XOR (2^31 - 1), and b can be paired with a, and no other pairings are possible, then the minimal number of groups is equal to the total number of numbers minus the number of pairs.

Where the number of pairs is the number of a where count(a) and count(b) are both positive, and we can pair them up min(count(a), count(b)) times.

Wait, but since a and b are distinct, the number of pairs is sum over a of min(count(a), count(b)).

But wait, each pair consists of a and b, so the total number of pairs is sum over a of min(count(a), count(b)).

Then, the total number of groups is ceil((n - 2 * number_of_pairs)/1), which is n - number_of_pairs.

Wait, no.

Actually, each pair reduces the number of groups by one, because two numbers can be put in one group.

So, the minimal number of groups is n - number_of_pairs.

Because each pair allows two numbers to be in one group, reducing the number of groups by one.

Wait, no. If I have two numbers in one group, it's like using one group for two numbers, so the number of groups is n - number_of_pairs.

Yes, that makes sense.

For example, if n=2 and they form a pair, then number_of_pairs=1, so groups=2-1=1.

If n=2 and they don't form a pair, then number_of_pairs=0, so groups=2.

If n=4 and there are two pairs, then groups=4-2=2.

If n=4 and there is only one pair, then groups=4-1=3.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, no, if n=4 and there is one pair, then the other two numbers need their own groups, so groups=4-1=3.

If n=4 and there are two pairs, then groups=4-2=2.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the minimal number of groups is n - number_of_pairs, where number_of_pairs is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with a XOR b = (2^31 - 1).

Now, to compute number_of_pairs, I need to iterate through the dictionary, and for each a, find b = a XOR (2^31 - 1), and add min(count(a), count(b)) to the total number of pairs, then set count(a)=0 and count(b)=0 to avoid double-counting.

Wait, but I need to make sure that I don't count a pair twice.

So, I can iterate through the dictionary, and for each a, if count(a) > 0 and count(b) > 0, then I can form min(count(a), count(b)) pairs, add that to the total number of pairs, and set count(a) and count(b) to zero.

But, to implement this efficiently, I need to make sure that I don't process a and b separately.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the dictionary, and for each a, if count(a) > 0 and count(b) > 0, then form pairs, and set the counts to zero.

But, to optimize, I can keep track of which a I have already processed.

Wait, but since a and b are distinct, I can process them in a way that I skip b after processing a.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to sort the dictionary by a, and for each a, if count(a) > 0 and count(b) > 0, then form pairs, and set count(a)=count(b)=0.

But in Python, dictionaries are ordered as of 3.7, but it's not guaranteed for all versions.

So, perhaps I can use a list of (a, count(a)) sorted by a.

Wait, but a is an integer, so sorting is fine.

But, to make it efficient, perhaps I can use a set to keep track of which a have been processed.

Wait, but sets might not be efficient for n up to 2*10^5.

Wait, no, sets in Python are efficient.

But, perhaps a better way is to iterate through the dictionary, and for each a, if count(a) > 0 and count(b) > 0, then form pairs, add min(count(a), count(b)) to number_of_pairs, and set count(a)=count(b)=0.

Otherwise, if count(a) > 0, then add count(a) to the number of single groups.

Wait, no, the single groups are the numbers that cannot be paired.

So, after forming all possible pairs, the remaining numbers will each need their own group.

So, the minimal number of groups is the number of pairs plus the number of unpaired numbers.

Wait, no, it's n - number_of_pairs.

Wait, let's clarify this.

Each pair allows two numbers to be in one group, reducing the number of groups by one from the total n.

So, minimal number of groups is n - number_of_pairs.

But, if n is odd, and number_of_pairs = floor(n/2), then groups = ceil(n/2).

But in this problem, since we can have pairs only where a XOR b = (2^31 - 1), the number of pairs is limited by the availability of such pairs.

So, to compute number_of_pairs, iterate through the dictionary, for each a, find b = a XOR (2^31 - 1), and add min(count(a), count(b)) to number_of_pairs, then set count(a)=count(b)=0.

Then, the minimal number of groups is n - number_of_pairs.

This should work.

Let me test this logic with the first test case.

First test case:

4

1 4 3 4

So, n=4, numbers are 1,4,3,4.

Compute b = a XOR (2^31 - 1) for each a.

Let check = 2^31 - 1.

So, b = a XOR check.

Now, check = 2^31 - 1 = all 31 bits set to 1.

So, b = a XOR check.

For a=1, b=1 XOR check.

For a=4, b=4 XOR check.

For a=3, b=3 XOR check.

For a=4, b=4 XOR check.

Now, count(a):

1:1, 4:2, 3:1.

Now, for a=1, b=1 XOR check.

Since check is all 31 bits set to 1, and a is up to 31 bits, so a XOR check is just the bitwise NOT of a.

So, b is the bitwise NOT of a.

So, for a=1, b=check XOR 1 = check - 1.

Wait, no.

Actually, a XOR check is equivalent to ~a & check, but since a is up to 31 bits, and check is 31 bits all set, a XOR check is indeed ~a & check.

But in Python, integers are handled as infinite length, so a XOR check will have higher bits as 1 if a has higher bits set.

But since the problem specifies considering only the first 31 bits, we can ignore higher bits.

So, b = a XOR check.

Now, for a=1, b=check XOR 1 = check - 1 - 1 = check - 2.

Wait, no.

Actually, a XOR check flips all the bits of a within the first 31 bits.

So, for a=1 (000...0001), b=check XOR 1 = 111...1110.

Similarly, for a=4 (000...0100), b=111...1011.

And for a=3 (000...0011), b=111...1100.

Now, check if any of these b are present in the list.

Looking at the list: 1,4,3,4.

So, for a=1, b=check XOR 1 is present? b is some large number, which is not in the list.

Similarly, for a=4, b=check XOR 4 is not in the list.

For a=3, b=check XOR 3 is not in the list.

So, no pairs can be formed.

Therefore, minimal number of groups is n - 0 = 4.

Which matches the first test case output.

Second test case:

2

0 2147483647

So, n=2, numbers are 0 and 2147483647.

check = 2147483647.

So, b = a XOR check.

For a=0, b=check XOR 0 = check.

Which is 2147483647, which is present in the list.

For a=2147483647, b=check XOR 2147483647 = 0, which is also present.

So, we can form one pair: 0 and 2147483647.

Therefore, number_of_pairs=1.

So, minimal number of groups is n - number_of_pairs = 2 - 1 = 1.

Which matches the second test case output.

Another test case:

4

0 0 2147483647 2147483647

So, n=4, numbers are 0,0,2147483647,2147483647.

count:

0:2, check=2147483647:2.

For a=0, b=check, min(count(a),count(b))=2.

So, number_of_pairs=2.

Minimal number of groups = n - number_of_pairs = 4 - 2 = 2.

Which matches the seventh test case output.

Another test case:

3

0 0 2147483647

n=3, numbers are 0,0,2147483647.

count:

0:2, check:1.

For a=0, b=check, min(2,1)=1.

So, number_of_pairs=1.

Minimal number of groups = 3 - 1 = 2.

Which matches the eighth test case output.

So, this logic seems consistent with the provided test cases.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the program:

def func():

times = int(input())

check = 2 ** 31 - 1

for _ in range(times):

n = int(input())

data = list(map(int, input().split()))

dic = dict()

ans = n

check = 2 ** 31 - 1

for i in data:

s = i ^ check

if s in dic:

dic[s] -= 1

ans -= 1

if dic[s] == 0:

del dic[s]

elif i in dic:

dic[i] += 1

else:

dic[i] = 1

print(ans)

So, in this program, for each test case, it reads n and the list of numbers.

Then, it initializes a dictionary dic to count the occurrences.

It sets ans = n, which will be decremented by the number of pairs found.

Then, for each number i in data:

s = i ^ check, where check = 2**31 - 1.

If s is in dic and dic[s] > 0, then it decrements dic[s] and decrements ans by 1.

If dic[s] reaches 0, it deletes s from dic.

Else, if i is in dic, it increments dic[i].

Else, it sets dic[i] = 1.

Finally, it prints ans.

Wait, but this seems a bit confusing.

Let me try to understand what's happening.

For each number i:

s = i ^ check.

If s is in dic and dic[s] > 0, then it decrements dic[s] and decrements ans by 1.

This seems like it's trying to pair i with s.

If s is present in the dictionary with positive count, then it forms a pair, decrements the count of s, and decrements ans by 1.

If s is not in dic, then it checks if i is in dic, and increments its count, or adds it to dic with count 1.

So, it's trying to pair each i with s = i ^ check, and if s is present, it forms a pair and reduces ans by 1.

Otherwise, it keeps i in dic and waits for its pair to appear.

Wait, but in the first iteration, when i appears, s might not have appeared yet, so it adds i to dic.

Then, when s appears later, it pairs s with i and reduces ans by 1.

This seems like it's correctly pairing a with b = a XOR check.

But, there is a potential issue here.

Suppose we have multiple a's and b's.

For example, n=4, with a,a,b,b, where b = a XOR check.

Then, the pairing should be two pairs, reducing ans by 2, so ans = 0.

But in this code, it iterates through the list, and for each i, it checks if s is in dic and dic[s] > 0.

If yes, it pairs them and decrements ans by 1 and dic[s] by 1.

If not, it adds i to dic or increments its count.

So, in the first iteration, i=a, s=b, dic is empty, so adds a to dic.

Second iteration, i=a, s=b, dic has a:1, so it checks if b is in dic and dic[b] > 0.

If b is not in dic yet, it adds a again to dic, making a:2.

Third iteration, i=b, s=a, dic has a:2, so pairs b with a, decrements dic[a] to 1, and decrements ans by 1.

Fourth iteration, i=b, s=a, dic has a:1, so pairs b with a, decrements dic[a] to 0, and decrements ans by 1.

Finally, ans = 4 - 1 -1 = 2.

Wait, but it should be ans = 0, since there are two pairs.

So, this code seems incorrect.

Wait, no, in the fourth
