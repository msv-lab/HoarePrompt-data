Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before the '1's. Like, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing the other characters to the right. For example, if I have "101", a cyclic shift would turn it into "110". Each time I do this, it costs me the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. So, I need to figure out the least number of shifts, each costing the length of the substring shifted, to arrange the string so that all '0's are before '1's.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift does to a substring. Let's take "101" as an example again. Shifting it once gives "110". Shifting again gives "011". So, with two shifts, I've transformed "101" into "011", which is sorted. Each shift costs the length of the substring, which is 3 in this case, so total cost is 6.

But is there a better way? Well, maybe instead of shifting the whole substring multiple times, I can shift smaller substrings with lower costs. For instance, if I shift the last two characters of "101", turning it into "110", that's one shift of cost 2, and then shifting the first two characters of "110" to get "101" again, which doesn't help. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, in the example given, for "10", shifting the entire string once costs 2, and it becomes "01", which is sorted. That seems optimal.

For "11000", the solution provided is 9, with shifts on [1,3], [2,4], and [3,5], each costing 3, for a total of 9.

Let me see what the function is doing.

Looking at the code:

- It reads the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case, it reads a string s and prints func_1(s).

- func_1 takes a string sChar, converts it to a list s.

- It initializes left=0, cost=0, right=1.

- Then, it enters a loop while left <= right and right < len(s) and left < len(s).

- Inside the loop:

- If s[right] is '0' and s[left] is '1', it swaps s[right] and s[left], and adds right - left + 1 to cost.

- Then, it moves right forward until s[right] is '0'.

- Then, it moves left forward until s[left] is '1'.

So, it seems like it's trying to find pairs where a '1' is before a '0' and swapping them, keeping track of the cost as the distance between them plus one.

This seems similar to bubble sort, where you swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, but here, it's swapping elements that are not necessarily adjacent, and the cost is the distance between them plus one.

But is this the most efficient way? In terms of cost, that is.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I want all '0's to the left and all '1's to the right. One way is to count the number of '0's on the right side and the number of '1's on the left side, and find a way to move them with minimal cost.

But the operation allowed is cyclic shifting of substrings, with cost equal to the length of the substring.

Is there a smarter way to do this?

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of inversion counts. In a sorted array, there are no inversions (pairs where a '1' appears before a '0'). So, the number of such inversions might relate to the number of operations needed.

But in this problem, the cost is not just the number of operations but the sum of the lengths of the substrings shifted.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be trying to fix inversions by swapping '1's and '0's.

But is this optimal in terms of cost?

In the first example, "10" -> "01" with cost 2, which matches the example.

In the third example, "11000":

- Initial string: 1 1 0 0 0

- First shift: [1,3] "110" -> "011", so the string becomes "01100"

- Second shift: [2,4] "110" -> "011", string becomes "00110"

- Third shift: [3,5] "110" -> "011", string becomes "00011"

Each shift costs 3, total cost 9.

Is there a way to do this with less cost?

Let's see:

- Shift [1,2]: "11" -> "11", no change.

- Shift [2,3]: "10" -> "01", string becomes "10100", cost 2.

- Shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", string becomes "01100", cost 2.

- Shift [3,4]: "10" -> "01", string becomes "01010", cost 2.

- Shift [2,3]: "10" -> "01", string becomes "00110", cost 2.

- Shift [4,5]: "10" -> "01", string becomes "00101", cost 2.

- Shift [3,4]: "10" -> "01", string becomes "00011", cost 2.

Total cost: 2*6 = 12, which is higher than 9.

So, the initial approach seems better.

But is there a way to get a lower cost than 9?

Let's try another sequence:

- Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

- Shift [4,5]: "00" -> "00", no change, cost 2.

- Shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "00110", cost 3.

- Shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "00011", cost 3.

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

Same as before.

Is there a way to reduce the cost?

What if I shift larger substrings?

- Shift [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", cost 5.

- Shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", string becomes "00110", cost 4.

- Shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "00011", cost 3.

Total cost: 5 + 4 + 3 = 12, which is higher.

Not better.

Is there a sequence of shifts that costs less than 9?

Let's try:

- Shift [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", string becomes "01100", cost 4.

- Shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", string becomes "00110", cost 4.

- Shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "00011", cost 3.

Total cost: 4 + 4 + 3 = 11, which is higher than 9.

Not better.

Another try:

- Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

- Shift [4,5]: "00" -> "00", no change, cost 2.

- Shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "00110", cost 3.

- Shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "00011", cost 3.

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

Same as before.

Seems like 9 is the minimal cost for this case.

Now, looking back at the code:

- It has left and right pointers.

- It looks for '1's on the left and '0's on the right.

- When it finds a '1' on the left and a '0' on the right, it swaps them and adds the cost.

- Then, it moves the right pointer forward until it finds a '0', and moves the left pointer forward until it finds a '1'.

This seems similar to the Dutch national flag problem, where you partition the array into '0's and '1's.

But in this case, the operation is not just swapping two elements, but cyclically shifting a substring, which is more restrictive.

Wait, in the code, it's swapping s[left] and s[right], which is not exactly a cyclic shift. It's just swapping two characters.

But according to the problem, the operation allowed is to perform a cyclic shift on a substring, which is different from swapping two characters.

So, is the code correctly implementing the allowed operation?

Wait, in the code, it's swapping s[left] and s[right], which is equivalent to performing a cyclic shift on the substring consisting of those two characters.

A cyclic shift on "10" would turn it into "01", which is the same as swapping the two characters.

So, in this case, it's equivalent.

But in general, a cyclic shift can be on any substring, not just two characters.

However, in this specific case, since we're dealing with binary strings and trying to sort them, swapping two adjacent characters might be sufficient.

But according to the problem, we can choose any substring and perform a cyclic shift on it, not just swap two characters.

So, the code is effectively performing swaps by choosing substrings of length 2 and performing cyclic shifts on them, which achieves the same result as swapping.

But perhaps there are more efficient ways by shifting longer substrings.

In the earlier example, shifting substrings of length 3 cost less than shifting multiple substrings of length 2.

So, maybe shifting longer substrings can be more cost-effective.

Therefore, the code might not always find the minimal cost because it's effectively only swapping two characters at a time.

Wait, but in the third example, it's shifting substrings of length 3, so maybe it's not just swapping two characters.

Wait, in the third example, it's shifting substrings of length 3, which costs 3 each, and does it three times for a total cost of 9.

But is there a way to do it with fewer shifts or shifts of different lengths to reduce the total cost?

In the earlier attempt, shifting substrings of lengths 3, 3, and 3, total 9.

Another sequence with shifts of lengths 5, 4, and 3, total 12.

Another sequence with shifts of lengths 4, 4, and 3, total 11.

So, 9 seems better.

Is there a sequence that achieves the same with a lower total cost?

Let's think differently.

Suppose I identify the positions where '1's and '0's are out of order.

In "11000", I can see that the first two characters are '1's, and the last three are '0's.

To make it "00011", I need to move the two '1's to the right of the three '0's.

So, I need to shift the '1's past the '0's.

One way is to perform shifts that move '1's to the right and '0's to the left.

But since I can only perform cyclic shifts on substrings, I need to choose substrings that allow me to move the '1's and '0's in the desired direction.

Another approach could be to count the number of '0's that need to be moved past '1's.

Wait, in terms of inversions, each '1' that appears before a '0' is an inversion that needs to be corrected.

In "11000", there are two '1's before three '0's, so there are 2*3 = 6 inversions.

If each shift can correct multiple inversions, then perhaps the minimal cost is related to the number of inversions divided by the number of inversions corrected per shift.

But I need to think in terms of shifting substrings.

Let me consider the positions:

Original: positions 1: '1', 2: '1', 3: '0', 4: '0', 5: '0'

Target: positions 1: '0', 2: '0', 3: '0', 4: '1', 5: '1'

So, I need to move the two '1's from positions 1 and 2 to positions 4 and 5.

Each '1' needs to be shifted two positions to the right.

If I perform a cyclic shift on [1,3], "110" -> "011", which moves one '1' to the right.

Then, perform a cyclic shift on [2,4], "110" -> "011", moving another '1' to the right.

Finally, perform a cyclic shift on [3,5], "110" -> "011", completing the sorting.

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

Is there a way to move both '1's in fewer shifts or with lower total cost?

Suppose I perform a shift on [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

Then, perform a shift on [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

Then, perform a shift on [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

Total cost: 4 + 4 + 3 = 11.

Higher than 9.

Not better.

Another approach: perform shifts that target multiple inversions at once.

For example, shifting [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", cost 5.

Then, shifting [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

Then, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

Total cost: 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.

Again, higher than 9.

Seems like the initial approach is better.

Is there a way to do it with fewer shifts?

Let's try:

- Shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01100", cost 3.

- Shift [4,5]: "00" -> "00", no change, cost 2.

- Shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "00110", cost 3.

- Shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "00011", cost 3.

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

Same as before.

Is there a sequence that costs less?

Wait, what if I shift [1,5] once: "11000" -> "01100", cost 5.

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01011", cost 3.

Then, shift [2,4]: "101" -> "110", string becomes "01101", cost 3.

Then, shift [4,5]: "01" -> "10", string becomes "01110", cost 2.

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", string becomes "01011", cost 3.

This seems messy and the cost is already 5 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 16, which is worse.

Not helpful.

Is there a better sequence?

Let's consider that each shift on a substring of length k can rearrange the elements in that substring, potentially correcting multiple inversions at once.

So, choosing larger substrings might be more efficient in terms of cost per inversion corrected.

In the initial approach, shifting substrings of length 3 corrects one inversion per shift.

Wait, in "11000", shifting [1,3]: "110" -> "011", which changes "11000" to "01100". This shift corrects the first '1' being before the third '0'.

Then, shifting [2,4]: "110" -> "011", changing "01100" to "00110". This corrects the second '1' being before the fourth '0'.

Finally, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", changing "00110" to "00011". This corrects the third '1' being before the fifth '0'.

So, each shift corrects one inversion, and the total cost is 9.

Is there a way to correct multiple inversions with a single shift?

Suppose I shift [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4. This corrects one inversion.

Then, shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4. This corrects another inversion.

Finally, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3. This corrects the last inversion.

Total cost: 4 + 4 + 3 = 11.

Still higher than 9.

Not better.

Another idea: since the cost is proportional to the length of the substring shifted, perhaps shifting larger substrings that correct more inversions at once could be more efficient.

But in practice, it seems that shifting smaller substrings is more flexible and can lead to lower total costs.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be effectively swapping '1's and '0's by shifting substrings of length 2, but in this specific implementation, it's shifting substrings of varying lengths based on the positions of '1's and '0's.

Wait, in the third example, it's shifting substrings of length 3, which is more than 2.

So, it's not just swapping two characters; it's performing cyclic shifts on substrings of length 3.

In "110" -> "011", which is a cyclic shift, correcting one inversion.

So, it's correcting one inversion per shift, with the cost equal to the length of the substring shifted.

In this case, with three shifts of length 3, total cost is 9.

Is there a way to correct multiple inversions with a single shift?

Suppose I have "11000". If I shift [1,5]: "11000" -> "01100", cost 5.

This corrects one inversion (the first '1' is now after the third '0').

Then, shift [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

This corrects another inversion.

Finally, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

This corrects the last inversion.

Total cost: 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.

Higher than 9.

Not better.

Another approach: count the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's.

In "11000", there are two '1's that need to be moved past three '0's.

So, each '1' needs to be moved past three '0's, but since they are consecutive, maybe moving them together is more efficient.

But in terms of cyclic shifts, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the positions again.

Original: 1 1 0 0 0

Target: 0 0 0 1 1

To get from original to target, I need to move the two '1's from positions 1 and 2 to positions 4 and 5.

Each '1' needs to be moved two positions to the right.

Each cyclic shift on a substring that includes one '1' and some '0's can move the '1' one position to the right.

So, to move one '1' two positions to the right, it would take two shifts, each costing the length of the substring.

But in the initial approach, it's moving both '1's in three shifts of length 3, costing 9.

Is there a way to move both '1's in fewer shifts or with lower total cost?

Suppose I perform a shift on [1,4]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

Now the string is "01100".

Then, perform a shift on [2,5]: "1100" -> "0110", cost 4.

Now the string is "00110".

Finally, perform a shift on [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

Now the string is "00011".

Total cost: 4 + 4 + 3 = 11.

Higher than 9.

Not better.

Another idea: maybe perform overlapping shifts.

For example, shift [1,3]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

String becomes "01100".

Then, shift [2,4]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

String becomes "00110".

Then, shift [3,5]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

String becomes "00011".

Total cost: 9.

Same as before.

Seems like 9 is the minimal cost.

So, perhaps the code is correct in this case.

Let's look at another example.

Take "101011".

According to the sample output, the cost is 5.

Let me see.

Initial string: 1 0 1 0 1 1

Target: 0 0 1 1 1 1

So, need to move the '1's after the '0's.

Let's see possible shifts.

Option 1:

- Shift [1,3]: "101" -> "110", string becomes 1 1 0 0 1 1, cost 3.

- Shift [2,4]: "100" -> "010", string becomes 1 0 1 0 1 1, cost 3.

- Shift [3,5]: "101" -> "110", string becomes 1 0 1 1 0 1, cost 3.

- Shift [4,6]: "101" -> "110", string becomes 1 0 1 1 1 0, cost 3.

- Shift [5,6]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 1 0 1 1 0 1, cost 2.

This seems not helpful.

Another option:

- Shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 0 1 1 0 1 1, cost 2.

- Shift [3,4]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 0 1 0 1 1 1, cost 2.

- Shift [2,3]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 0 0 1 1 1 1, cost 2.

Total cost: 6.

But the sample output is 5, so there's a better sequence.

Another try:

- Shift [1,3]: "101" -> "110", string becomes 1 1 0 0 1 1, cost 3.

- Shift [2,4]: "100" -> "010", string becomes 1 0 1 0 1 1, cost 3.

- Shift [3,5]: "101" -> "110", string becomes 1 0 1 1 0 1, cost 3.

- Shift [4,6]: "101" -> "110", string becomes 1 0 1 1 1 0, cost 3.

- Shift [5,6]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 1 0 1 1 0 1, cost 2.

Still not helpful.

Another approach:

- Shift [1,4]: "1010" -> "0101", string becomes 0 1 0 1 1 1, cost 4.

- Shift [2,3]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 0 0 1 1 1 1, cost 2.

Total cost: 6.

Still higher than 5.

Is there a better sequence?

Let's try:

- Shift [1,5]: "10101" -> "11010", string becomes 1 1 0 1 0 1, cost 5.

- Shift [2,4]: "101" -> "110", string becomes 1 1 1 0 0 1, cost 3.

- Shift [5,6]: "01" -> "10", string becomes 1 1 1 0 1 0, cost 2.

- Shift [4,6]: "010" -> "001", string becomes 1 1 1 0 0 1, cost 3.

This is not helping.

Another idea:

- Shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 0 1 1 0 1 1, cost 2.

- Shift [3,4]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 0 1 0 1 1 1, cost 2.

- Shift [2,3]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 0 0 1 1 1 1, cost 2.

Total cost: 6.

Still 6.

Is there a way to get 5?

Maybe:

- Shift [1,3]: "101" -> "110", string becomes 1 1 0 0 1 1, cost 3.

- Shift [4,6]: "011" -> "101", string becomes 1 1 0 1 0 1, cost 3.

- Shift [3,4]: "01" -> "10", string becomes 1 1 1 0 0 1, cost 2.

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8.

Higher than 5.

Not good.

Another try:

- Shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 0 1 1 0 1 1, cost 2.

- Shift [3,4]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 0 1 0 1 1 1, cost 2.

- Shift [2,3]: "10" -> "01", string becomes 0 0 1 1 1 1, cost 2.

Total cost: 6.

Same as before.

Is there a sequence that costs 5?

Maybe:

- Shift [1,3]: "101" -> "110", cost 3.

- Shift [2,4]: "100" -> "010", cost 3.

- Shift [4,6]: "011" -> "101", cost 3.

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

Higher than 5.

Not helpful.

Another idea: perhaps shifting larger substrings can correct multiple inversions at once.

But in practice, it seems that shifting smaller substrings is more efficient.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way to choose the substrings.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the positions of '1's and '0's that are out of place.

In "101011", positions 1,3,5 are '1's that need to be moved to the right, and positions 2,4 are '0's that are already in the correct section.

Wait, actually, in the target sorted string, all '0's should be before '1's.

So, in "101011", '0's are in positions 2 and 4, and '1's are in positions 1,3,5,6.

To sort it, I need to move the '1's in positions 1,3,5 to after the '0's.

So, positions 1 and 3 need to be moved past positions 2 and 4.

Wait, more carefully:

- Position 1: '1' needs to be after positions 2 and 4 ('0's).

- Position 3: '1' needs to be after position 4 ('0').

- Position 5: '1' needs to be after position 4 ('0').

So, total inversions: position 1 vs position 2, position 1 vs position 4, position 3 vs position 4, position 5 vs position 4.

Total inversions: 4.

If each shift can correct at least one inversion, then minimal cost would be at least 4.

But according to the sample, it's 5.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in "101011", the '1's that are before '0's are:

- First '1' is before the second '0' (position 2 before position 4).

- Third '1' is before the fourth '0' (position 5 before position 4).

Wait, positions:

1: '1'

2: '0'

3: '1'

4: '0'

5: '1'

6: '1'

So, inversions are:

- Position 1 ('1') before position 4 ('0')

- Position 3 ('1') before position 4 ('0')

- Position 5 ('1') before position 4 ('0')

Total inversions: 3.

So, minimal cost should be at least 3.

But the sample output is 5, which is higher.

Perhaps because each shift can correct only one inversion, and the cost is the length of the substring shifted.

So, even if a shift corrects multiple inversions, you still pay the cost of the substring length.

In this case, perhaps shifting substrings that correct multiple inversions isn't always beneficial in terms of cost.

Let me see.

Suppose I shift [1,3]: "101" -> "110", cost 3.

This corrects one inversion (position 1 before position 4).

Now string is "110011".

Then, shift [2,4]: "100" -> "010", cost 3.

Now string is "101011".

Then, shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", cost 2.

Now string is "011011".

Then, shift [3,4]: "10" -> "01", cost 2.

Now string is "010111".

Then, shift [2,3]: "10" -> "01", cost 2.

Now string is "001111".

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.

Higher than 5.

Not good.

Another approach:

- Shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", cost 2.

Now string is "011011".

- Shift [4,5]: "01" -> "10", cost 2.

Now string is "011101".

- Shift [5,6]: "01" -> "10", cost 2.

Now string is "011110".

- Shift [4,5]: "11" -> "11", no change, cost 2.

No improvement.

Total cost so far: 6.

Not better.

Another idea: perhaps shifting substrings that include both '1's and '0's to move multiple '1's at once.

For example, shift [1,4]: "1010" -> "0101", cost 4.

Now string is "010111".

Then, shift [2,3]: "10" -> "01", cost 2.

Now string is "001111".

Total cost: 6.

Still higher than 5.

Is there a better sequence?

Let me try:

- Shift [1,3]: "101" -> "110", cost 3.

Now string is "110011".

- Shift [1,2]: "11" -> "11", no change, cost 2.

- Shift [3,4]: "00" -> "00", no change, cost 2.

- Shift [4,5]: "01" -> "10", cost 2.

Now string is "110101".

- Shift [5,6]: "01" -> "10", cost 2.

Now string is "110110".

- Shift [4,6]: "110" -> "011", cost 3.

Now string is "110110" -> "110011".

This is not helping.

Total cost so far: 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 14.

Way higher than 5.

Not good.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that each '1' that needs to be moved past '0's can be moved by shifting substrings that include that '1' and the '0's it needs to pass.

But this is getting complicated.

Perhaps the code provided is correct, and I'm just not understanding it fully.

Let me look at the code again.

def func_1(sChar):

s = []

for i in sChar:

s.append(i)

left = 0

cost = 0

right = 1

while left <= right and right < len(s) and left < len(s):

if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':

(s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])

cost += right - left + 1

while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':

right += 1

while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':

left += 1

return cost

So, it's swapping '1's and '0's when '1' is on the left and '0' is on the right, and adding the cost as right - left + 1.

In the third example, "11000", let's see what it does:

- Initialize left=0, right=1

- s = ['1','1','0','0','0']

- First iteration:

- s[right]='1', s[left]='1', no swap

- Move right to 2, s[right]='0'

- Now s[right]='0' and s[left]='1', swap positions 0 and 2: ['0','1','1','0','0'], cost += 3 (right=2, left=0, 2-0+1=3)

- Move right to 3, s[right]='0'

- s[right]='0' and s[left]='1', swap positions 3 and 0: ['0','1','1','0','0'], but they are same, so no change, cost +=4

- Wait, no, s after first swap is ['0','1','1','0','0']

- left=0, which is '0', so move left to 1, which is '1'

- right=3, which is '0'

- Swap positions 1 and 3: ['0','0','1','1','0'], cost += 4

- Move right to 4, s[right]='0'

- left=1, s[left]='0', move left to 2, s[left]='1'

- right=4, s[right]='0', swap positions 2 and 4: ['0','0','0','1','1'], cost += 3

- Total cost: 3 + 4 + 3 = 10

But according to the sample, it should be 9.

Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Let's simulate it step by step.

Initialize:

s = ['1','1','0','0','0']

left=0, right=1

- s[right]='1', s[left]='1', no swap

- Move right to 2, s[right]='0'

- s[right]='0', s[left]='1', swap positions 0 and 2: ['0','1','1','0','0'], cost += 3

- Move right to 3, s[right]='0'

- s[right]='0', s[left]='0' (since left=0 still), so move left to 1, s[left]='1'

- s[right]='0', s[left]='1', swap positions 1 and 3: ['0','0','1','1','0'], cost += 3 (right=3, left=1, 3-1+1=3)

- Move right to 4, s[right]='0'

- s[right]='0', s[left]='1' (left=1), so swap positions 1 and 4: ['0','0','1','1','0'], but s[1] and s[4] are both '0', so no change, cost += 5

- Move right to 5, which is out of bounds, so exit

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 5 = 11

But according to the sample, it should be 9.

So, perhaps the code is not correctly implementing the intended shifts.

Alternatively, maybe the sample is using a different sequence of shifts.

But in the explanation, it shows three shifts of length 3, totaling 9.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the code is supposed to be swapping only adjacent elements, but in this case, it's swapping non-adjacent elements, which might not correspond to the allowed operation.

The allowed operation is to perform a cyclic shift on any substring, which is not the same as swapping two arbitrary elements.

In the code, it's swapping s[left] and s[right], which is equivalent to performing a cyclic shift on the substring from left to right, but only if left and right are adjacent.

Wait, no, cyclic shift on a substring is different from swapping two characters.

For example, cyclic shift on "101" would turn it into "110", which is not the same as swapping any two characters.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect because it's performing swaps that don't correspond to the allowed operation.

Hence, the answer is **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. The cost of each shift is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Cyclic Shifts**: A cyclic shift on a substring moves the last character to the front, shifting other characters to the right.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: To minimize cost, we should aim to correct multiple inversions with single shifts by choosing substrings that contain both '1's and '0's in a way that moving a
