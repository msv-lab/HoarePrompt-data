Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n children in a class, and m pairs among them are friends with a friendship value f_i. The teacher goes on k excursions, and for each excursion, she randomly chooses a pair of children equiprobably and independently. If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. Pairs who are not friends have a friendship value of 0 that never changes.

I need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship values can increase over time based on selection.

First, I need to understand the setup. There are n children, and m pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value f_i. The teacher chooses k pairs randomly, and if a chosen pair is among the m friends, their f_i increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

I need to calculate the expected sum of the friendship values at the time of choosing each pair over k excursions.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I recall that expectation is linear, which means that the expected sum is the sum of the expectations for each individual choice. So, perhaps I can find the expected friendship value for each choice and then sum them up.

Let’s denote E_j as the expected friendship value at the time of the j-th choice.

Then, the total expected sum S would be:

S = E_1 + E_2 + ... + E_k

Now, I need to find each E_j.

But this seems complicated because the friendship values can change over time based on previous selections.

Wait, the problem says: "the friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions." So, if a pair is chosen at excursion t, their f_i increases by 1 for all future excursions t+1, t+2, ..., k.

But, in the sum, we are considering the friendship value at the time of being chosen, not the impact on future excursions.

Wait, no. The problem says: "the friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions." So, the increase happens after the current excursion, affecting future excursions, but not the current one.

Wait, re-reading: "If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0, and it does not change for subsequent excursions."

So, when a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions, but not for the current one.

So, for the current excursion, the friendship value is f_i, and for all future excursions, it becomes f_i + 1.

But in the sum, we are considering the friendship value at the time of being chosen.

Wait, the problem says: "the friendship value of a pair who are friends increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions."

So, the increase happens after the current excursion.

Hence, for the current excursion, it's still f_i, but for the next excursion, it's f_i + 1 if they were chosen in the previous one, and so on.

But the sum is of the friendship values at the time of being chosen.

So, I need to sum up the friendship values at the time each pair is chosen over k excursions.

This seems tricky because the friendship values can change over time based on which pairs are chosen previously.

I need to find the expected sum of these friendship values.

Let me consider the contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.

Let's denote a friend pair p with initial friendship value f_p.

I need to find the expected number of times p is chosen multiplied by its friendship value at the time of being chosen, summed over all friend pairs and all k excursions.

Wait, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as each friend pair having a certain probability of being chosen in each excursion, and their friendship value increases by 1 each time they are chosen in previous excursions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times a pair is chosen.

Let’s think about it.

Let’s denote X_p be the number of times pair p is chosen in the k excursions.

Then, the friendship value of pair p at the time of being chosen in the j-th excursion is f_p plus the number of times p was chosen before the j-th excursion.

Wait, more carefully:

For each time a pair p is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

So, if a pair is chosen t times, their friendship value increases by t for all excursions after those t choices.

But in the sum, we are considering the friendship value at the time of being chosen.

So, for each choice of pair p at excursion j, their friendship value is f_p plus the number of times p was chosen before j.

Wait, yes.

So, if pair p is chosen t times in the k excursions, and those choices are at excursions j1, j2, ..., jt.

Then, for each choice at j, the friendship value is f_p plus (number of times p was chosen before j).

Wait, more precisely, since the friendship value increases by 1 after each choice, the friendship value at the time of the choice is f_p plus the number of times p was chosen before that choice.

So, for the first choice, it's f_p + 0, second choice f_p +1, third f_p +2, etc.

Hence, for t choices, the total contribution to the sum is:

(f_p + 0) + (f_p +1) + ... + (f_p + (t-1)) = t*f_p + (0 +1 +...+ (t-1)) = t*f_p + t*(t-1)/2

Wait, no, 0 +1 +...+ (t-1) is t*(t-1)/2, which is correct.

So, total contribution for pair p is t*f_p + t*(t-1)/2.

But t is random, as it's the number of times p is chosen in k independent choices.

Wait, but p is chosen in each excursion with probability 1/C, where C is the total number of possible pairs.

Wait, total possible pairs are n choose 2, which is n*(n-1)/2.

So, probability that p is chosen in any single excursion is 2/(n*(n-1)), since there are n*(n-1)/2 pairs.

Wait, no, the probability of choosing any specific pair is 1 over the total number of pairs, which is n*(n-1)/2.

Hence, probability that p is chosen in one excursion is 2/(n*(n-1)), wait no, it's 1 over C, where C is n*(n-1)/2.

Wait, no, 1 over C is 2/(n*(n-1)), but that's not correct.

Wait, no, n choose 2 is n*(n-1)/2, so the probability of choosing a specific pair is 1/(n*(n-1)/2) = 2/(n*(n-1)).

Wait, actually, no. The probability of choosing a specific pair is 1 over the total number of pairs, which is n*(n-1)/2.

Hence, p is chosen in one excursion with probability p = 2/(n*(n-1)).

Wait, no, 1/(n choose 2) is 2/(n*(n-1)), but actually, n choose 2 is n*(n-1)/2, so 1/(n*(n-1)/2) = 2/(n*(n-1)).

Wait, no, 1/(n choose 2) is 2/(n*(n-1)), but that's incorrect.

Wait, no, 1/(n choose 2) is 2/(n*(n-1)), because n choose 2 is n*(n-1)/2, hence 1/(n*(n-1)/2) = 2/(n*(n-1)).

Wait, no, that's correct.

So, probability that p is chosen in one excursion is p = 2/(n*(n-1)).

Wait, but in the problem, it says the teacher chooses a pair equiprobably and independently, so the probability of choosing any specific pair is 1 over the total number of possible pairs, which is n choose 2, which is n*(n-1)/2.

Hence, probability is 1/(n*(n-1)/2) = 2/(n*(n-1)).

Wait, but n choose 2 is n*(n-1)/2, so 1/(n*(n-1)/2) is indeed 2/(n*(n-1)).

Wait, but 2/(n*(n-1)) is the same as 1/(n choose 2), but n choose 2 is n*(n-1)/2, so 1/(n*(n-1)/2) = 2/(n*(n-1)).

Wait, perhaps it's better to keep it as 1/(C), where C = n*(n-1)/2.

Now, the number of times p is chosen in k excursions follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p = 1/C.

Wait, no, p = 1/C, where C = n*(n-1)/2.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I thought p = 2/(n*(n-1)), which is equal to 1/(C).

Wait, yes, because C = n*(n-1)/2, so 1/C = 2/(n*(n-1)).

Hence, p is chosen in each excursion with probability p = 1/C = 2/(n*(n-1)).

Wait, but in the binomial distribution, it's p = 1/C.

Wait, but in reality, n choose 2 is C = n*(n-1)/2, so p = 1/C = 2/(n*(n-1)).

Now, the number of times p is chosen in k excursions is a binomial random variable with parameters k and p = 1/C.

Hence, t ~ Binomial(k, p = 1/C).

Now, the total contribution of p to the sum is t*f_p + t*(t-1)/2.

Wait, earlier I had t*f_p + t*(t-1)/2, but I need to verify that.

Wait, for each time p is chosen, the friendship value at that time is f_p plus the number of times p was chosen before that choice.

So, if p is chosen t times, the first time it's f_p + 0, second time f_p +1, third time f_p +2, and so on up to f_p +(t-1).

Hence, the sum is sum from i=0 to t-1 of (f_p + i) = t*f_p + sum from i=0 to t-1 of i = t*f_p + t*(t-1)/2.

Yes, that seems correct.

Hence, the total contribution of p is t*f_p + t*(t-1)/2.

Now, since t is a random variable following a binomial distribution with parameters k and p = 1/C, I need to compute the expectation of t*f_p + t*(t-1)/2.

Since expectation is linear, this is E[t]*f_p + E[t*(t-1)/2)].

Now, E[t] for a binomial random variable is k*p = k/C.

Similarly, E[t*(t-1)] = Var(t) + E[t]*(E[t] -1) = k*p*(1-p) + k*p*(k*p -1).

Wait, actually, for a binomial random variable, E[t*(t-1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2.

Wait, more precisely, E[t*(t-1)] = Var(t) + E[t]^2 - E[t] = k*p*(1-p) + k^2*p^2 - k*p.

Simplify: k*p - k*p^2 + k^2*p^2 - k*p = k^2*p^2 - k*p^2 = k*p^2*(k -1).

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Actually, for a binomial random variable, E[t*(t-1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2.

Hence, E[t*(t-1)/2] = (k*(k-1)*p^2)/2.

Hence, the total expected contribution of p is E[t]*f_p + E[t*(t-1)/2] = (k*p)*f_p + (k*(k-1)*p^2)/2.

Now, p = 1/C, where C = n*(n-1)/2.

Hence, p = 2/(n*(n-1)).

So, plugging in, we get:

Expected contribution of p = (k * 2/(n*(n-1))) * f_p + (k*(k-1) * (2/(n*(n-1)))^2)/2

Simplify the second term:

(k*(k-1) * 4/(n^2*(n-1)^2)) / 2 = (k*(k-1) * 4)/(2*n^2*(n-1)^2) = (k*(k-1) * 2)/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

Hence, total expected contribution of p is:

(2*k*f_p)/(n*(n-1)) + (2*k*(k-1))/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

Wait, no, the second term has a numerator of 4 divided by 2, which is 2, but I think I missed something.

Wait, let's recalculate the second term:

E[t*(t-1)/2] = (k*(k-1)*p^2)/2

With p = 2/(n*(n-1)), p^2 = 4/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

Hence, E[t*(t-1)/2] = (k*(k-1)*4)/(2*n^2*(n-1)^2) = (k*(k-1)*2)/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

Yes, that's what I had.

Hence, total expected contribution of p is:

(2*k*f_p)/(n*(n-1)) + (2*k*(k-1))/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

Now, since there are m such friend pairs, the total expected sum S is:

S = sum over p in m of [ (2*k*f_p)/(n*(n-1)) + (2*k*(k-1))/(n^2*(n-1)^2) ]

But wait, no. There are m friend pairs, each contributing their own term.

Hence, S = sum_{p=1 to m} [ (2*k*f_p)/(n*(n-1)) + (2*k*(k-1))/(n^2*(n-1)^2) ]

But actually, the second term does not depend on p, so it's the same for all m friend pairs.

Wait, no, the second term does not depend on f_p, only on k, n, and m.

Hence, S = sum_{p=1 to m} [ (2*k*f_p)/(n*(n-1)) ] + sum_{p=1 to m} [ (2*k*(k-1))/(n^2*(n-1)^2) ]

The first sum is (2*k)/(n*(n-1)) * sum_{p=1 to m} f_p

The second sum is m * (2*k*(k-1))/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

Hence, S = (2*k)/(n*(n-1)) * sum_{p=1 to m} f_p + (2*k*(k-1)*m)/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

Now, this seems manageable.

Let me denote sum_{p=1 to m} f_p as F.

Hence, S = (2*k*F)/(n*(n-1)) + (2*k*(k-1)*m)/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

Now, this is the expected sum of friendship values over k excursions, considering the dynamic increase in friendship values.

But the problem mentions that for pairs who are not friends, their friendship value is 0 and does not change.

However, since only friend pairs have their friendship values increase, and non-friend pairs always contribute 0, we don't need to consider them in the sum.

Wait, but in the excursions, the teacher chooses any pair randomly, including non-friend pairs.

But their contribution is 0, and remains 0, so they don't affect the sum.

Hence, only the m friend pairs contribute to the sum.

Hence, the expression above should be the total expected sum.

Now, the problem says to output p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 +7), where p/q is the reduced form of the expected value.

Hence, I need to compute S as p/q, reduce it to lowest terms, and then compute p * q^{-1} mod 10^9+7.

But, since S is a fraction, I need to represent it in terms of p and q.

Wait, actually, S is already a fraction, but I need to compute it modulo 10^9+7 after expressing it as p * q^{-1}.

Hence, I need to compute S = (numerator)/(denominator), then find numerator * denominator^{-1} mod 10^9+7.

So, I need to express S in terms of numerator and denominator.

Looking back at S:

S = (2*k*F)/(n*(n-1)) + (2*k*(k-1)*m)/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

Let me find a common denominator for these two terms.

The denominators are n*(n-1) and n^2*(n-1)^2.

Hence, the least common denominator is n^2*(n-1)^2.

Hence, S = [ (2*k*F)*n*(n-1) + (2*k*(k-1)*m) ] / (n^2*(n-1)^2)

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, first term is (2*k*F)/(n*(n-1)), second is (2*k*(k-1)*m)/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

So, to have a common denominator of n^2*(n-1)^2, I need to write the first term as (2*k*F)*(n*(n-1)) / (n^2*(n-1)^2)

Wait, no, to make the denominator n^2*(n-1)^2, I need to multiply numerator and denominator of the first term by n*(n-1).

Hence, first term becomes (2*k*F * n*(n-1)) / (n^2*(n-1)^2)

Second term is already (2*k*(k-1)*m) / (n^2*(n-1)^2)

Hence, S = [2*k*F*n*(n-1) + 2*k*(k-1)*m] / (n^2*(n-1)^2)

Now, I can factor out 2*k:

S = 2*k [ F*n*(n-1) + (k-1)*m ] / (n^2*(n-1)^2)

Hence, numerator is 2*k*( F*n*(n-1) + (k-1)*m )

Denominator is n^2*(n-1)^2

Hence, S = [2*k*( F*n*(n-1) + (k-1)*m )] / [n^2*(n-1)^2]

Now, I need to compute this fraction modulo 10^9+7, after reducing it to lowest terms.

Given that n and m can be up to 1e5, and k up to 2e5, and F can be up to m*1e9, which is 1e14, I need to handle large numbers.

Also, since t can be up to 5e4, and sum of n and m over all test cases is up to 1e5 and sum of k up to 2e5, I need an efficient solution.

Now, to compute S, I need to compute the numerator and denominator, then reduce them modulo 10^9+7, and compute the modular inverse of the denominator.

But since 10^9+7 is a prime, I can use Fermat's Little Theorem to compute the inverse.

But, I need to ensure that the denominator is coprime with 10^9+7. Since 10^9+7 is prime, as long as n and (n-1) are not multiples of 10^9+7, which they aren't in this context, since n can be up to 1e5, which is less than 10^9+7.

Hence, I can safely compute the inverse.

Now, in code, I need to compute:

numerator = 2 * k * ( F * n * (n-1) + (k-1) * m )

denominator = n * n * (n-1) * (n-1)

Then, S = numerator / denominator

Then, S mod 10^9+7 is (numerator * denominator^{-1}) mod 10^9+7

I need to compute this for each test case.

Given the constraints, I need to make sure that the computations are efficient and handle large numbers correctly, using modular arithmetic.

Also, since F can be up to 1e14, and other terms are up to 1e5, their products can be very large, so I need to compute them modulo 10^9+7 directly.

But, since I'm dealing with fractions, I need to ensure that the division is correctly handled.

Hence, I need to compute numerator * denominator^{-1} mod 10^9+7

To do this, I need to compute:

- Compute numerator modulo 10^9+7

- Compute denominator^{-1} modulo 10^9+7

- Multiply them together modulo 10^9+7

But, to compute numerator, which is 2 * k * ( F * n * (n-1) + (k-1) * m ), I need to handle large numbers.

Given that F can be up to 1e14, and n and
