Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two arrays, a and b, with lengths n and m respectively, and there's an even number k. I need to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to k are included among the chosen elements.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. The arrays a and b can have duplicates, since the problem mentions arrays with integers, and the example shows duplicates. The value of k is even and ranges from 2 up to twice the minimum of n and m. So, k can be up to the size of the smaller array, but since k is even, it's always an even number.

The task is not to find how to choose the elements but just to determine whether it's possible to choose them in such a way that all integers from 1 to k are included among the chosen elements.

Looking at the examples:

In the first example:

a = [2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5]

b = [1, 3, 4, 10, 5]

k = 6

We can choose from a: 2, 3, 6

From b: 1, 4, 5

And this covers all numbers from 1 to 6.

In the second example:

a = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5]

b = [1, 3, 8, 10, 3]

k = 6

It's stated that it's not possible. So, I need to figure out why.

I think the key here is to look at the unique elements in each array and see if we can cover all numbers from 1 to k by selecting k/2 elements from each array.

First step: Identify the unique elements in each array that are within the range 1 to k.

For array a, find elements where 1 <= element <= k, and same for array b.

Then, find the intersection and the unique elements in each array.

Let me think in terms of sets.

Let me denote:

- Only in a: elements that are in a but not in b, within 1 to k.

- Only in b: elements that are in b but not in a, within 1 to k.

- In both: elements that are in both a and b, within 1 to k.

Now, to cover all numbers from 1 to k, we need to make sure that:

- The total unique elements from both arrays cover all numbers from 1 to k.

- We can select k/2 elements from each array such that all numbers from 1 to k are included.

Wait, but we might have some numbers that are only in a or only in b, and some that are in both.

If a number is only in a, we must select it from a.

Similarly, if a number is only in b, we must select it from b.

For numbers that are in both, we can choose from either array.

So, the constraints are:

- The number of elements to choose from a is k/2.

- The number of elements to choose from b is k/2.

- All numbers from 1 to k must be chosen.

Let me formalize this.

Letâ€™s define:

- only_a: elements only in a within 1 to k.

- only_b: elements only in b within 1 to k.

- both: elements in both a and b within 1 to k.

Then, to cover all numbers from 1 to k, we need:

- all elements in only_a must be chosen from a.

- all elements in only_b must be chosen from b.

- for elements in both, we can choose to take them from a or b.

Now, the number of elements we need to choose from a is k/2, and from b is k/2.

So, the number of elements that must be chosen from a is the size of only_a, and from b is the size of only_b.

Then, the remaining elements to reach k/2 can be chosen from both.

So, the condition is:

- The size of only_a must be less than or equal to k/2.

- The size of only_b must be less than or equal to k/2.

- The total distinct elements from both arrays must be at least k.

Because we need to cover all numbers from 1 to k.

Wait, but in the first example:

only_a = {2, 3, 6}

only_b = {1,4,5}

both = {}

total distinct = 6, which is equal to k=6.

In the second example:

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5]

b = [1,3,8,10,3]

only_a = {2,4,5,6}

only_b = {1}

both = {3}

total distinct = 6, which is equal to k=6.

But it's said it's not possible. So, there must be more to it.

Wait, perhaps the number of times we can choose from each array is limited to k/2.

So, in the second example, only_a has 4 elements {2,4,5,6}, but we can only choose k/2=3 elements from a.

Similarly, only_b has 1 element {1}, and we can choose up to 3 from b.

But, only_a has 4 elements that must be chosen from a, but we can only choose 3 from a. So, it's impossible.

Ah, that makes sense.

So, the condition should be:

- The size of only_a must be less than or equal to k/2.

- The size of only_b must be less than or equal to k/2.

- The total distinct elements from both arrays must be at least k.

Because:

- If only_a > k/2, we can't choose enough elements from a to cover only_a.

- Similarly for only_b.

- And we need to have at least k distinct elements to cover 1 to k.

So, in the second example, only_a has 4 elements, but k/2=3, so it's impossible.

In the first example, only_a has 3, only_b has 3, and total distinct is 6, which matches k=6.

So, the conditions are satisfied.

Another example in the problem:

Third test case:

a = [1,3,5]

b = [2,4,6]

k=4

only_a = {1,3}

only_b = {2,4}

both = {}

total distinct = 4, which is equal to k=4.

So, only_a has 2, which is <= k/2=2.

only_b has 2, which is <= k/2=2.

Total distinct is 4, which is equal to k.

So, it's possible.

Fourth test case:

n=2, m=5, k=4

a=[1,4]

b=[7,3,4,4,2]

only_a = {1}

only_b = {2,3}

both = {4}

total distinct = 5, which is greater than or equal to k=4.

only_a size=1 <=2

only_b size=2 <=2

So, possible.

Fifth test case:

n=1, m=4, k=4

a=[2]

b=[6,4,2,1]

only_a = {2}

only_b = {1,4}

both = {}

total distinct = 4, which is equal to k=4.

only_a size=1 <=2

only_b size=2 <=2

So, possible.

Wait, but the output is "NO". So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, n=1, m=4, k=4

a=[2]

b=[6,4,2,1]

only_a = {2}

only_b = {1,4}

both = {}

total distinct = 4, which is equal to k=4.

only_a size=1 <=2

only_b size=2 <=2

But, we need to choose k/2=2 elements from each array.

From a, we can only choose 1 element, which is 2.

From b, we can choose 2 elements, say 1 and 4.

But, we need to cover all numbers from 1 to 4.

We have chosen 2 from a and 1 and 4 from b.

But, number 3 is missing.

So, even though total distinct is 4, the actual chosen elements might not cover all from 1 to k.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, total distinct is 4, which is equal to k=4, and only_a and only_b sizes are within limits.

But, in practice, we can't cover all numbers from 1 to k because 3 is missing.

So, perhaps my condition is not sufficient.

I need to ensure that the union of the chosen elements from both arrays covers all numbers from 1 to k.

In this case, even though total distinct is 4, which includes 1,2,4 from b and a, but 3 is missing in the chosen elements.

Wait, but 3 is in b, but in my earlier logic, only_b includes 1 and 4, and both is empty.

Wait, b has 6,4,2,1, so only_b is {1,4,6,2}, but 6 is greater than k=4, so only_b is {1,2,4}.

Wait, a has [2], b has [6,4,2,1], so within 1 to k=4, a has {2}, b has {1,2,4}.

So, only_a = {2}

only_b = {1,4}

both = {}

Wait, but 2 is in both a and b, so both = {2}

only_a = empty

only_b = {1,4}

Then, total distinct is 3: 1,2,4

But k=4, so missing 3.

So, total distinct is less than k.

Wait, but in my earlier logic, I had total distinct as 4, which was incorrect.

Wait, a has [2], b has [6,4,2,1]

relevant a: {2}

relevant b: {1,2,4}

both: {2}

only_a: empty

only_b: {1,4}

total distinct: only_a + only_b + both = 0 + 2 +1 =3 <k=4

So, in this case, total distinct is 3, which is less than k=4.

So, it's "NO"

But in my earlier analysis, I thought total distinct was 4, but actually, it's 3.

So, my mistake was in calculating total distinct.

So, the condition should be:

- The sum of sizes of only_a, only_b, and both should be at least k.

But in this case, only_a=0, only_b=2, both=1, total=3 <4.

Hence, "NO"

So, my earlier mistake was miscounting the total distinct.

So, the condition is correct: only_a + only_b + both >=k

And only_a <=k/2 and only_b <=k/2

In this case, only_a=0 <=2

only_b=2 <=2

total=3 <4

Hence, "NO"

Another test case:

n=1, m=4, k=4

a=[2]

b=[6,4,2,1]

only_a: empty

only_b: {1,4}

both: {2}

total distinct: 3 <4

Hence, "NO"

Another test case:

n=2, m=5, k=4

a=[1,4]

b=[7,3,4,4,2]

only_a: {1}

only_b: {2,3}

both: {4}

total distinct: 4 >=4

only_a=1 <=2

only_b=2 <=2

Hence, "YES"

But in this case, we choose 1 and 4 from a, and 2 and 3 from b.

So, all numbers from 1 to 4 are covered.

Another test case:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a=[1,3,5]

b=[2,4,6]

only_a: {1,3}

only_b: {2,4}

both: empty

total distinct:4 >=4

only_a=2 <=2

only_b=2 <=2

Hence, "YES"

Another test case:

n=6, m=5, k=6

a=[2,3,8,5,6,5]

b=[1,3,4,10,5]

only_a: {2,3,5,6}

only_b: {1,4,5}

both: empty

Wait, no.

Wait, a has [2,3,8,5,6,5], relevant a: {2,3,5,6}

b has [1,3,4,10,5], relevant b: {1,3,4,5}

So, both: {3,5}

only_a: {2,6}

only_b: {1,4}

total distinct: only_a + only_b + both =2 +2 +2=6 >=6

only_a=2 <=3

only_b=2 <=3

Hence, "YES"

Another test case:

n=6, m=5, k=6

a=[2,3,4,5,6,5]

b=[1,3,8,10,3]

only_a: {2,4,5,6}

only_b: {1,3}

both: empty

Wait, no.

a has [2,3,4,5,6,5], relevant a: {2,3,4,5,6}

b has [1,3,8,10,3], relevant b: {1,3}

So, both: {3}

only_a: {2,4,5,6}

only_b: {1}

total distinct:4 +1 +1=6 >=6

only_a=4 >3

Hence, "NO"

Because only_a=4 >k/2=3

So, the condition holds.

Hence, the logic seems correct.

So, in the program, for each test case, we need to:

- Find unique elements in a and b within 1 to k.

- Compute only_a, only_b, and both.

- Check if only_a <=k/2 and only_b <=k/2 and only_a + only_b + both >=k

- If yes, "YES", else "NO"

Looking at the given program:

def func_1(t, cases):

results = []

for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:

unique_a = set(a)

unique_b = set(b)

relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}

relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}

only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b

only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a

both = relevant_a & relevant_b

if len(only_a) > k // 2:

results.append('NO')

continue

if len(only_b) > k // 2:

results.append('NO')

continue

total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)

if total_distinct < k:

results.append('NO')

continue

results.append('YES')

return results

This seems to match the logic I just described.

So, I think the program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of two given arrays such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements. 

## Approach

1. **Input Parsing:** Read the input for multiple test cases.
2. **Set Operations:** For each test case, identify unique elements in each array that are within the range [1, k].
3. **Set Differences and Intersections:**
   - Calculate elements unique to array `a` (`only_a`).
   - Calculate elements unique to array `b` (`only_b`).
   - Calculate elements common to both arrays (`both`).
4. **Feasibility Checks:**
   - Ensure the number of unique elements to be chosen from each array does not exceed \( \frac{k}{2} \).
   - Ensure the total unique elements from both arrays cover all numbers from 1 to \( k \).

## Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cases.append((n, m, k, a, b))
results = func_1(t, cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        unique_b = set(b)
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        results.append('YES')
    return
