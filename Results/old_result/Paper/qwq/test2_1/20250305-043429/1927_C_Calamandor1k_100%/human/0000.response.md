Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two arrays, a and b, with lengths n and m respectively, and there's an even number k. I need to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to k are included among the chosen elements.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. The arrays a and b can have duplicates, since the problem mentions arrays with integers, and the example shows duplicates. The value of k is even and ranges from 2 up to twice the minimum of n and m. The input consists of multiple test cases, and for each test case, I need to output "YES" or "NO" based on whether it's possible to choose the elements as specified.

Looking at the examples provided:

In the first test case:

n=6, m=5, k=6

a = [2,3,8,5,6,5]

b = [1,3,4,10,5]

It's possible to choose 2,3,6 from a and 1,4,5 from b, covering all numbers from 1 to 6.

In the second test case:

n=6, m=5, k=6

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5]

b = [1,3,8,10,3]

It's not possible to choose elements such that all numbers from 1 to 6 are covered.

So, the task is to check if it's possible to select k/2 elements from each array such that the union of these selected elements contains all integers from 1 to k.

I need to think about how to approach this efficiently, especially considering the constraints: t ≤ 10^4 and n, m ≤ 2*10^5, with the total sum of n and m over all test cases not exceeding 4*10^5. This suggests that the solution should be O(n + m) per test case, or possibly O(n log n) at worst, but we need to be careful with time constraints.

Let me think about the key aspects:

1. We need to choose k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b, totaling k elements.

2. Among these k elements, every integer from 1 to k must be present.

This means that the union of the chosen elements from a and b should cover the set {1, 2, ..., k}.

First idea: We need to ensure that all numbers from 1 to k are covered by either a or b, but since we have to choose exactly k/2 from each, there might be some constraints on how we distribute the selections.

Wait, but actually, we can have some numbers chosen from both arrays, as long as we choose exactly k/2 from each array.

Wait no, we're choosing elements based on their values, not their positions in the arrays. So, if a number appears multiple times in an array, we can choose it multiple times, but since we're dealing with integers from 1 to k, and the problem seems to imply that we're considering the values themselves, not their positions.

Wait, but the problem says "every integer from 1 to k is included among the chosen elements", not necessarily that we choose k distinct elements. But, given that k is even and we're choosing k/2 from each array, it's likely that we need to choose k distinct elements, covering all from 1 to k.

Looking back at the examples, in the first test case, they choose 2,3,6 from a and 1,4,5 from b, which are all distinct and cover 1 to 6.

In the second test case, it's not possible, presumably because some numbers are missing or cannot be covered due to insufficient occurrences.

Wait, in the second test case, a = [2,3,4,5,6,5], b = [1,3,8,10,3]. If I try to choose numbers from a and b, I need to cover 1 to 6.

From a: 2,3,4,5,6

From b: 1,3

So, if I choose 2,3,6 from a and 1,3,5 from b, but 4 is already in a, so maybe choosing 2,4,6 from a and 1,3,5 from b would cover all from 1 to 6. But the problem says it's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says "it is not possible to choose elements in the required way". So, perhaps there is some constraint that I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps because in b, 5 appears only once, and if I need to choose 5 from b, but it's only present once, and I need to choose k/2=3 elements from b, which include 1,3,5, but 5 is only once. Wait, but in a, 5 appears twice, so maybe I can choose 5 from a and not from b. But overall, as long as 5 is chosen from either a or b, it should be fine.

Wait, perhaps there's a dependency on the counts of each number in a and b.

I need to think differently. Maybe I need to look at the coverage of numbers from 1 to k by a and b.

Let me consider the numbers from 1 to k and see in which arrays they appear.

Define:

- only_a: numbers from 1 to k that appear only in a

- only_b: numbers from 1 to k that appear only in b

- both: numbers from 1 to k that appear in both a and b

Then, to cover all numbers from 1 to k, I need to choose all numbers in only_a from a, and all numbers in only_b from b. For numbers in both, I can choose them from either a or b.

But I have to choose exactly k/2 from a and k/2 from b.

So, the minimal number of elements I need to choose from a is the number of elements in only_a, and similarly, from b, it's the number of elements in only_b.

If the number of elements in only_a is greater than k/2, or the number of elements in only_b is greater than k/2, then it's impossible, because I can't choose more than k/2 from each array.

Also, the total number of distinct elements from 1 to k should be at least k.

Wait, no, it should be exactly k, but since k is even, and we need to choose k/2 from each array, ensuring that all k elements are covered.

Wait, but the problem says "every integer from 1 to k is included among the chosen elements", which implies that all k elements are covered, and k is even.

So, to summarize:

- Let only_a be the set of numbers from 1 to k that appear only in a

- Let only_b be the set of numbers from 1 to k that appear only in b

- Let both be the set of numbers from 1 to k that appear in both a and b

Then, to cover all k elements:

- I must choose all elements in only_a from a

- I must choose all elements in only_b from b

- For elements in both, I can choose them from either a or b

Let's denote:

- count_only_a = len(only_a)

- count_only_b = len(only_b)

- count_both = len(both)

Then, the total number of distinct elements from 1 to k is count_only_a + count_only_b + count_both.

If count_only_a + count_only_b + count_both < k, then it's impossible to cover all k elements, so the answer is "NO".

Otherwise, I need to check if it's possible to choose k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b, such that:

- all only_a are chosen from a

- all only_b are chosen from b

- the remaining selections from a and b cover the both set appropriately.

Specifically:

- The number of elements chosen from a should be k/2, which includes all only_a and some from both.

- Similarly, the number of elements chosen from b should be k/2, which includes all only_b and some from both.

So, the number of elements that need to be chosen from a is count_only_a + x, where x is the number of both elements chosen from a.

Similarly, the number of elements chosen from b is count_only_b + y, where y is the number of both elements chosen from b.

And we have:

count_only_a + x = k/2

count_only_b + y = k/2

And x + y >= count_both (since we need to cover all both elements from either a or b).

Also, x and y cannot exceed the number of times the elements in both appear in a and b, respectively.

Wait, but since we're choosing elements by value, and the arrays may have duplicates, but we're only concerned with choosing the numbers from 1 to k, regardless of how many times they appear in the arrays, as long as they appear at least once.

Wait, no, actually, since the problem says "choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays", and "among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included", it seems that we're choosing the values, not considering duplicates beyond their presence.

In other words, for the purpose of choosing the k elements, we only care if a number is present in a or b, not how many times.

So, perhaps I can consider the sets of unique elements in a and b.

Let me redefine:

- unique_a = set of unique elements in a

- unique_b = set of unique elements in b

- only_a = unique_a intersected with 1 to k, minus unique_b

- only_b = unique_b intersected with 1 to k, minus unique_a

- both = unique_a intersected with unique_b intersected with 1 to k

Then, as before:

- I must choose all only_a from a

- I must choose all only_b from b

- For both, I can choose them from either a or b

Now, the number of elements I need to choose from a is count_only_a + x, where x is the number of both elements chosen from a.

Similarly, the number of elements to choose from b is count_only_b + y, where y is the number of both elements chosen from b.

With x + y >= count_both, and x >= 0, y >= 0.

And count_only_a + x = k/2

count_only_b + y = k/2

So, x = k/2 - count_only_a

y = k/2 - count_only_b

Then, x + y = k - (count_only_a + count_only_b)

And we need x + y >= count_both

So, k - (count_only_a + count_only_b) >= count_both

But since count_only_a + count_only_b + count_both = total distinct in 1 to k

And we have total distinct >=k (from earlier)

Wait, no, total distinct could be less than k, but if total distinct <k, then it's impossible to cover all k elements.

So, assuming total distinct >=k, which is one of the conditions.

Wait, no, actually, total distinct must be >=k, otherwise, it's impossible.

So, if count_only_a + count_only_b + count_both <k, then "NO"

Otherwise, we need to ensure that x = k/2 - count_only_a >=0

And y = k/2 - count_only_b >=0

And x + y >= count_both

If these conditions are satisfied, then it's possible.

So, in code, for each test case, I need to:

1. Read n, m, k

2. Read array a and b

3. Compute unique_a = set(a) & set(range(1,k+1))

4. Compute unique_b = set(b) & set(range(1,k+1))

5. Compute only_a = unique_a - unique_b

6. Compute only_b = unique_b - unique_a

7. Compute both = unique_a & unique_b

8. count_only_a = len(only_a)

9. count_only_b = len(only_b)

10. count_both = len(both)

11. If count_only_a + count_only_b + count_both <k, then "NO"

12. Else, if count_only_a > k/2 or count_only_b >k/2, then "NO"

13. Else, "YES"

Wait, why is step 12 necessary?

Because if count_only_a > k/2, but we need to choose exactly k/2 from a, and count_only_a elements must be chosen from a, but k/2 < count_only_a, which is impossible.

Similarly, if count_only_b >k/2, same issue.

And in step 11, if total distinct <k, it's impossible to cover all k elements.

Is there any other condition I'm missing?

Let me think about the earlier example where it's "NO".

n=6, m=5, k=6

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5]

b = [1,3,8,10,3]

unique_a = {2,3,4,5,6}

unique_b = {1,3,8,10}

only_a = {2,4,5,6}

only_b = {1}

both = {3}

total distinct = 4 +1 +1 =6, which is equal to k=6

count_only_a =4

count_only_b=1

k/2=3

count_only_a=4 >3, so step 12 would catch this and return "NO", which matches the example.

Another test case:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a=[1,3,5]

b=[2,4,6]

unique_a={1,3,5}

unique_b={2,4,6}

only_a={1,3,5} - {2,4,6} = {1,3,5}

only_b={2,4,6} - {1,3,5} = {2,4,6}

both= empty set

total distinct =3+3+0=6 >=4

count_only_a=3 >2 (k/2=2), so "NO"

Wait, but the sample output is "YES" for this case.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the logic.

Wait, in this case, only_a={1,3,5}, only_b={2,4,6}, both=empty

But k=4, so numbers from 1 to 4.

But only_a has 1,3,5, but only numbers up to 4 are considered, so only_a={1,3}

only_b={2,4}

both=empty

Wait, I think I need to intersect with range(1,k+1)

So, unique_a = {1,3,5} intersect {1,2,3,4} = {1,3}

unique_b = {2,4,6} intersect {1,2,3,4} = {2,4}

only_a={1,3} - {2,4} = {1,3}

only_b={2,4} - {1,3} = {2,4}

both= empty

count_only_a=2

count_only_b=2

k/2=2

So, count_only_a <=k/2 and count_only_b <=k/2, and total distinct=4 >=k=4

So, "YES"

In my earlier incorrect reasoning, I had count_only_a=3, but that's wrong because 5 is outside of 1 to k=4.

So, I need to be careful to intersect with range(1,k+1)

Another test case:

n=2, m=5, k=4

a=[1,4]

b=[7,3,4,4,2]

unique_a={1,4}

unique_b={2,3,4,7} intersect {1,2,3,4} = {2,3,4}

only_a={1}

only_b={2,3}

both={4}

count_only_a=1

count_only_b=2

k/2=2

x = k/2 - count_only_a =2-1=1

y=2-2=0

x+y=1 >= count_both=1

So, it's possible.

Another test case:

n=1, m=4, k=4

a=[1]

b=[4,2,4,2]

unique_a={1}

unique_b={2,4}

only_a={1}

only_b={2,4}

both=empty

count_only_a=1 <=2

count_only_b=2 <=2

total distinct=3 <4

So, "NO"

But the sample input doesn't have this case.

Wait, the sample input has t=6, but only 6 lines of input, which seems odd.

Wait, checking the sample input:

6

6 5 6

2 3 8 5 6 5

1 3 4 10 5

6 5 6

2 3 4 5 6 5

1 3 8 10 3

3 3 4

1 3 5

2 4 6

2 5 4

1 4

7 3 4 4 2

1 4 2

3

2 2 1 4 3

Wait, this seems to be t=6, but the following lines are n, m, k, a, b repeated for each test case.

But in the code, it's reading t, then reading t sets of n, m, k, a, b.

Then, calling func_1(t, cases), which processes the cases and returns results.

In func_1, for each case, it computes unique_a and unique_b intersected with 1 to k, then only_a, only_b, both, and applies the conditions:

- if count_only_a >k/2 or count_only_b >k/2: "NO"

- elif total_distinct <k: "NO"

- else: "YES"

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

Sample Input:

6

6 5 6

2 3 8 5 6 5

1 3 4 10 5

6 5 6

2 3 4 5 6 5

2 4 6

2 5 4

1 4

7 3 4 4 2

1 4 2

3

2 2 1 4 3

Sample Output:

YES

NO

YES

YES

NO

NO

Let's verify the third test case:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a=[1,3,5]

b=[2,4,6]

unique_a={1,3}

unique_b={2,4}

only_a={1,3}

only_b={2,4}

both=empty

count_only_a=2 <=2

count_only_b=2 <=2

total_distinct=4 >=4

Hence, "YES"

Fourth test case:

n=2, m=5, k=4

a=[1,4]

b=[7,3,4,4,2]

unique_a={1,4}

unique_b={2,3,4}

only_a={1}

only_b={2,3}

both={4}

count_only_a=1 <=2

count_only_b=2 <=2

total_distinct=4 >=4

Hence, "YES"

Fifth test case:

n=1, m=4, k=4

a=[1]

b=[
