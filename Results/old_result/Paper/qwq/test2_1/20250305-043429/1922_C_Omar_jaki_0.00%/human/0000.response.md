Alright, I have this problem to solve. There are n cities located on a number line, each with a unique coordinate. I need to handle multiple queries, each asking for the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another, given specific movement rules.

First, I need to understand the movement options:

1. I can travel directly from city x to any other city y, paying the absolute difference in their coordinates, which is |a_x - a_y| coins.

2. Or, I can travel to the closest city to x, paying just 1 coin.

The problem states that for each city, there's a uniquely determined closest city, so no ambiguity there.

Given that the cities are sorted in increasing order of their coordinates, i.e., a1 < a2 < ... < an, I can leverage this ordering to optimize my solution.

Let's consider the example provided:

Cities: [0, 8, 12, 15, 20]

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0) -> City 2 (8)

- City 2 (8) -> City 3 (12)

- City 3 (12) -> City 4 (15)

- City 4 (15) -> City 3 (12)

- City 5 (20) -> City 4 (15)

Queries:

1. From city 1 to city 4:

- Go from 1 to 2 (closest, 1 coin)

- Go from 2 to 3 (closest, 1 coin)

- Go from 3 to 4 (closest, 1 coin)

- Total: 3 coins

2. From city 1 to city 5:

- Go from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5, which would cost 4 coins, but the direct path from 1 to 5 costs |20 - 0| = 20 coins, which is worse. However, the example says 8 coins, which must be achieved through a different sequence.

Wait, in the example output, it's 3,8,1,4,14. So for the first query, it's 3 coins, which matches the sequence above. For the second query, it's 8 coins, which is less than the direct 20 coins, so there must be a better path.

Let's think about how to model this problem efficiently, especially considering the constraints: n can be up to 10^5, and m up to 10^5, with the sum of n and m across all test cases up to 10^5 each. So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n + m) time per test case.

I need to find the minimum cost to travel from city x to city y, using the options to either go directly to any city or move to the closest city for 1 coin.

One way to approach this is to model the cities as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1, and edges to all other cities with weights equal to the absolute difference in their coordinates.

However, building such a graph explicitly would be too slow for the given constraints. I need a smarter way to compute the minimum cost without explicitly building the graph.

Let me think about the properties of the movement options:

- Moving to the closest city is cheap (1 coin), but it's only to one specific city.

- Moving directly to any city is more expensive, but it's faster.

I need to balance between using the cheap moves to get closer and then making a direct move when it's beneficial.

Given that the cities are on a number line, and they're sorted, I can think of the number line as a straight line with cities at specific points.

Let's consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step towards a neighboring city, but sometimes it might be better to make a bigger jump directly.

Wait, but the closest city can be either to the left or to the right, depending on the positions.

Wait, no, since the cities are sorted, for city i, the closest city is either i-1 or i+1, whichever is closer.

Wait, no, not necessarily, because the difference between consecutive cities can vary.

For example, in the sample input:

Cities: 0,8,12,15,20

- City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (8), since 8-0=8, and city 3 is 12-0=12, which is larger.

- City 2 (8): closest is city 3 (12), since 12-8=4, and city 1 is 8, city 4 is 15-8=7.

- City 3 (12): closest is city 4 (15), since 15-12=3, city 2 is 4, city 5 is 20-12=8.

- City 4 (15): closest is city 3 (12), since 15-12=3, city 5 is 20-15=5.

- City 5 (20): closest is city 4 (15), since 20-15=5.

So, the closest city is not always the immediate neighbor, but sometimes further away, depending on the differences in coordinates.

Wait, in this example, city 1's closest is city 2 (difference 8), but city 2's closest is city 3 (difference 4), which is smaller than city 1's difference to city 2.

This suggests that moving to the closest city can skip over some cities.

Now, to find the minimum cost path from city x to city y, I need to consider sequences of moves where I can either move directly to y or make a series of moves to the closest city and then maybe make a direct move.

This seems similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, where I can prioritize cheaper moves first, but again, with m up to 10^5 per test case, I need something faster.

Let me think differently. Since the cities are on a number line and sorted, perhaps I can compute some precomputed distances or cumulative sums that allow me to calculate the minimum cost between any two cities quickly.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving towards the center of some cluster of cities, and then from there, I can make a direct move to the target city.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1, and also edges to all other cities with weights equal to their direct distance.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

However, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, building such a graph is impractical due to time and space constraints.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is always cheaper than moving directly, especially since it costs only 1 coin.

So, in an optimal path, I would prefer to move to the closest city repeatedly until I get close enough to the target city, and then make a direct move.

But I need to formalize this idea.

Let me consider that the sequence of moves to the closest city forms a path that can be thought of as a chain, and I can precompute some distances along these chains.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city the distance to the "root" of its chain, where the root is a city that is its own closest city.

But in this problem, since the closest city is unique and not necessarily forming a tree, I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, since each city has exactly one closest city, this forms a graph where each node has outdegree 1, which forms a collection of trees or cycles.

But given that the cities are on a number line and the coordinates are strictly increasing, I doubt there are cycles, so it should form a tree with multiple roots.

Wait, but in the sample input, city 3's closest is city 4, and city 4's closest is city 3, which could form a cycle if both point to each other.

But the problem states that for every city, the closest city is unique, so there are no ties.

Wait, but in the sample input, city 3's closest is city 4, and city 4's closest is city 3, so it's possible to have mutual closest cities.

This could form a cycle in the graph, which might complicate things.

But in this case, it's just a cycle of two cities pointing to each other.

In such a case, moving between them would cost 1 coin each way, which is cheaper than the direct distance.

Wait, in the sample input, city 3 and city 4 have a distance of 3, but moving via closest cities would cost 1+1=2 coins, which is less than 3.

But in reality, in the sample input, city 3's closest is city 4, and city 4's closest is city 3.

So, to move from city 3 to city 4, it's cheaper to move to the closest city (city 4) for 1 coin.

Similarly, moving from city 4 to city 3 is also 1 coin.

So, in such cycles of two cities, moving between them costs 1 coin.

But what if I have longer cycles?

For example, city A -> city B -> city C -> city A.

In this case, moving from A to B costs 1 coin, B to C costs 1 coin, and C back to A costs 1 coin.

So, the cost to traverse the cycle is equal to the number of steps in the cycle.

But in terms of finding the shortest path between two cities in this graph, I need to consider both the direct edges and the edges to closest cities.

This seems complicated to handle directly, especially with the constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving upwards in a tree towards some root, and then from there, moving downwards to the target city.

But given that the graph might have cycles, it's not a tree.

Wait, perhaps I can detect the cycles and contract them, turning the graph into a tree.

But this might be too time-consuming for the given constraints.

Another idea: Since moving to the closest city costs only 1 coin, I can think of it as moving along the graph with edges of weight 1 to the closest city, and also having direct edges to any city with weight equal to their distance.

Then, the shortest path would be the minimum over all possible paths using these edges.

But again, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way to compute the minimum cost between any two cities without explicitly computing all possible paths.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimum over all sequences of moves that include moving to the closest city for 1 coin and moving directly for the distance cost.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that moving to the closest city repeatedly will eventually lead me to a city that is its own closest city, or to a cycle.

Then, for any two cities, if they share the same "root" city, then the minimal cost to move between them is the sum of the costs to move to the root plus the cost to move from the root to the target.

But in the presence of cycles, this might not directly apply.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city the sequence of moves to its "root" city, and precompute the cost to reach the root.

Then, to move from x to y, I can go from x to root_x, then from root_x to root_y, and then from root_y to y.

But this might not be optimal, especially if there are cycles.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Given that the cities are on a number line and sorted, perhaps I can use the fact that the minimal cost path respects the ordering in some way.

Wait, here's an idea: Since the cities are sorted by their coordinates, I can think of them as being arranged in order on the number line.

Then, moving from one city to another can be thought of as moving left or right on this line.

If I can find a way to move left or right using the closest city moves efficiently, I might be able to compute the minimal cost.

But I'm not sure yet.

Let me consider dynamic programming or some cumulative sum approach.

Suppose I precompute for each city the minimal cost to reach all cities to its left and to its right separately.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem as a graph where cities are connected in a tree-like structure based on their closest city relationships, and then compute some kind of distance in this tree.

But again, with cycles, it's not a tree.

Wait, perhaps I can decompose the graph into its strongly connected components and then compute distances between components.

But this seems too involved for the time constraints.

Let me consider that in the graph formed by the closest city edges, moving along these edges is cheap (1 coin each), while moving directly to any city is more expensive but faster.

So, it's beneficial to move along the cheap edges as much as possible before making a direct move to the target.

In other words, I can think of it as moving along the cheap edges to get as close as possible to the target, and then make a direct move to the target.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to formalize the minimal cost.

Let cost(x, y) be the minimal cost to move from x to y.

Then, cost(x, y) = min(

|a_x - a_y|, # direct move

1 + cost(closest_x, y) # move to closest city and then to y

)

This recurrence suggests that I can compute the cost dynamically.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, this is not feasible directly.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can precompute for each city the minimal cost to reach all other cities in a certain way.

Wait, maybe I can observe that moving along the closest city edges forms paths that can be traversed cheaply, and then make a direct jump when necessary.

But I need a better structure.

Let me consider that the graph formed by the closest city edges is a collection of trees or cycles.

In such a case, I can compute the minimal cost between two nodes by considering their paths in the graph.

But again, with the constraints, I need something faster.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimal over all sequences of moves that include moving to the closest city and moving directly.

Perhaps I can find a way to compute this using the difference in coordinates and the number of cheap moves I can make.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city the minimal number of cheap moves needed to reach a certain position, and then use that to compute the minimal cost.

This is getting too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the target city y and try to find the minimal cost from x to y for all x.

But that still seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that moving to the closest city is like moving towards y in some way, but I need to formalize this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1 and edges to all other cities with weight equal to their distance, and then run Dijkstra's algorithm for each query.

But again, with m up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimal over all possible numbers of cheap moves, k, of (k * 1 + distance from x to y after k cheap moves).

But I'm not sure how to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of cheap moves to get within a certain distance of y, and then make a direct move.

But I need to make this precise.

Let me consider that for each city x, I can move to its closest city for 1 coin, and repeat this process, accumulating the cost.

At each step, I can choose to stop and make a direct move to y.

So, the total cost would be the number of cheap moves plus the direct distance from the current city to y.

I need to choose the minimal such cost over all possible numbers of cheap moves.

This sounds similar to iterating through the path from x to its root in the closest city graph and choosing the point where switching to a direct move minimizes the total cost.

But again, with the constraints, I need a way to compute this without iterating through each possible path.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city the sequence of moves to its root and the cumulative cost, and then use that to compute the minimal cost between any two cities.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city repeatedly forms a path, and I can precompute for each city the sequence of moves to reach a certain city in the path, along with the cumulative cost.

Then, for any two cities, I can find their paths and find a common point where switching to a direct move minimizes the total cost.

This still seems too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimal over all possible sequences of cheap moves to get to some city z, and then make a direct move from z to y.

So, cost(x, y) = min over z of (number of cheap moves from x to z + direct distance from z to y)

But computing this directly is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compute this using dynamic programming or some precomputed values.

Let me consider that for each city x, I can compute the minimal cost to reach y by considering the minimal number of cheap moves to get to a city that is close enough to y, and then make a direct move.

But I need to formalize "close enough."

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the minimal number of cheap moves needed to reach a city whose direct distance to y is less than some threshold.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a graph, and the direct move is like a shortcut edge to any city.

Then, the minimal cost is the shortest path in this graph.

But again, with the constraints, I need something faster.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that the minimal cost is equal to the direct distance between x and y minus twice the maximum distance saved by moving to the closest city.

But I'm not sure.

This isn't helping.

Let me look for a different approach.

Given that the cities are sorted on a number line, maybe I can use the fact that moving to the closest city is moving towards a certain direction, and then use some kind of prefix sum to compute the minimal cost.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city the minimal cost to reach all cities to its left and to its right separately, using the cheap moves.

But I need to think differently.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving to a certain neighbor that is closer to the target.

But in reality, the closest city might not necessarily be in the direction of the target.

For example, in the sample input, city 1's closest is city 2, which is in the direction of city 4, but city 5 is further to the right.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city and also direct edges to all other cities, and then find the minimal cost path using Dijkstra's algorithm.

But with m up to 1e5 and n up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for any two cities x and y, the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimal over all possible paths of the sum of the costs of the moves.

Given that moving to the closest city is cheap (1 coin), and moving directly is more expensive but faster, I should prefer using the cheap moves to get as close as possible to y, and then make a direct move.

So, I can think of it as moving from x to its closest city, then to the closest city of that city, and so on, until I'm "close enough" to y, and then make a direct move to y.

But I need to define what "close enough" means.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the minimal number of cheap moves needed to reach a city that is closer to y than the direct move cost.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the minimal over all k of (k + |a_y - a_z|), where z is the city reached after k cheap moves from x.

I need to minimize k + |a_y - a_z| over all possible z reachable from x in k cheap moves.

But with n up to 1e5, I can't compute this for each query.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city repeatedly will eventually lead me to y if y is on the path, or to a city from which y is directly reachable at a lower cost.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1, and also an edge to y with weight |a_y - a_x|.

Then, the minimal cost is the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But again, with m up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the minimal over all sequences of cheap moves followed by a direct move.

So, for each x, I can consider moving to its closest city, then to the closest city of that city, and so on, and for each such move, I can compute the total cost if I make a direct move to y from that city.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimal such total cost over all possible numbers of cheap moves.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the city and the cost reached after k cheap moves, for k up to log n.

Then, use something similar to binary lifting to find the minimal cost.

But this seems too involved and time-consuming for the constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step towards y, but sometimes it might not be directly towards y.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the minimal cost as the direct distance minus the maximum savings I can get by moving to the closest city multiple times.

But I'm not sure.

This isn't working.

Let me consider that for any two cities x and y, the minimal cost is the minimal over all paths of the sum of the costs of the moves.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to compute this using the difference in coordinates and the number of cheap moves.

But I need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that moving to the closest city is always better than moving directly, unless the direct move is cheaper.

Wait, no, sometimes moving directly is cheaper.

For example, in the sample input, moving from city 1 to city 5 directly costs |20 - 0| = 20 coins, but moving via closest cities costs 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins, which is cheaper.

So, moving via closest cities can be cheaper.

Hence, I need to find the minimal cost between moving directly or moving via closest cities.

But how?

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the minimal over all possible sequences of cheap moves followed by a direct move.

So, for each x, I can consider moving to its closest city, then to the closest city of that city, and so on, and for each such move, I can compute the total cost if I make a direct move to y from that city.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimal such total cost over all possible sequences.

But again, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by moving via its closest city.

Something like dp[x] = min(dp[closest[x]] + 1, |a_y - a_x|)

But with overlapping subproblems, this might not be efficient.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a chain, and I can precompute the minimal cost to reach y from each city in the chain.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the direct distance minus the maximal savings I can get by moving via the closest city.

The savings would be the difference between the direct move and the cheap move.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the difference in distances.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city and then moving to y can save me some cost compared to moving directly from x to y.

But I need to quantify this.

Wait, perhaps I can use the triangle inequality or some geometric properties.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the minimal over all possible sequences of moves, which can be modeled as the shortest path in a graph.

But again, with the constraints, this is not feasible.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step towards y, but sometimes it might not be directly towards y.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of the difference in coordinates.

But I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that moving to the closest city is cheaper than moving directly, so I should prefer moving via the closest city unless the direct move is cheaper.

So, for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y is the minimum between |a_y - a_x| and 1 + minimal cost from the closest city to y.

But this leads to a recursive definition, which is too slow to compute for each query.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the minimal cost from x to y is the minimal over all possible paths of the sum of the costs.

Given that, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by moving via its closest city, and store this in a table.

But with m up to 1e5, this is still too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the direct distance minus the maximal savings I can get by moving via the closest city.

The savings would be the difference between the direct move and the cheap move.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by moving to its closest city and accumulating the cost, and then choose the minimal among these.

But again, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the direct distance minus the minimal distance saved by moving via the closest city.

But I need to make this precise.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by moving to its closest city and then to y, and choose the minimal among the direct move and the cheap move via the closest city.

So, cost(x, y) = min(|a_y - a_x|, 1 + cost(closest[x], y))

But computing this recursively is too slow.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can compute this using memoization or dynamic programming.

Let me try to precompute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y.

I can iterate from the farthest cities to y and compute the minimal cost step by step.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that for the city y itself, cost(y, y) = 0.

For other cities, cost(x, y) = min(|a_y - a_x|, 1 + cost(closest[x], y))

I can try to compute this iteratively, starting from cities that are closest to y and moving outward.

But with n up to 1e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the cities in order and compute the minimal cost to y based on the minimal cost of their closest cities.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that the closest city relation forms a tree or a forest, and I can perform a tree traversal to compute the minimal costs.

But with cycles possible, it's not a tree.

This complicates things.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a graph, and I can model the minimal cost using BFS or some other graph traversal.

But with cycles, BFS might not be directly applicable.

This is getting too involved for the time constraints.

Let me consider that for any city x, moving to its closest city and accumulating the cost until I reach y or a city from which y is directly reachable at a lower cost.

But again, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the direct distance minus the minimal distance saved by moving via the closest city.

The minimal distance saved would be the minimal difference between the direct move and the cheap move.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y as the minimal over all z of (cost(x, z) + |a_z - a_y|), where z is any city.

But this is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step towards y, reducing the distance by a certain amount.

But in reality, moving to the closest city might not necessarily reduce the distance to y.

For example, in the sample input, moving from city 3 to city 4 reduces the distance to city 5 from 8 to 5, which is helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by moving to its closest city and accumulating the cost, until I find a city z where |a_z - a_y| < |a_x - a_y| - steps, where steps is the number of cheap moves.

But I'm getting too vague.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the direct distance minus the number of cheap moves I can make in the direction towards y.

But I need to make this precise.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y as the minimal over k of (k + |a_y - a_z|), where z is the city reached after k cheap moves from x.

Then, I can precompute for each x, the sequence of cities reached by repeatedly moving to the closest city, and precompute the minimal such cost.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a graph with weight 1, and moving directly is like having a direct edge with weight equal to the distance.

Then, the minimal cost is the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

Given that, perhaps I can precompute some distances or find a way to compute the shortest path efficiently.

But again, with the constraints, I need something faster.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the direct distance minus the maximal reduction I can get by moving via the closest city.

The maximal reduction would be the minimal direct distance from any city z to y minus the cost to reach z from x via cheap moves.

So, reduction = |a_y - a_z| - (number of cheap moves from x to z)

Then, minimal cost = |a_y - a_x| - max(reduction over all z)

But I need to make this precise.

This seems too involved.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a graph with weight 1, and moving directly is like a shortcut with weight equal to the distance.

Then, the minimal cost is the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

Given that, perhaps I can model this graph and find a way to compute the shortest paths efficiently.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for any two cities x and y, the minimal cost is the minimal over all possible paths of the sum of the costs.

Given that, perhaps I can find a mathematical formula to compute this directly based on the coordinates and the closest city relations.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step towards y, reducing the distance by a certain amount.

But in reality, moving to the closest city might not necessarily reduce the distance to y.

For example, in the sample input, moving from city 3 to city 4 reduces the distance to city 5 from 8 to 5, which is helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by moving to its closest city and accumulating the cost, until I reach a city that is closer to y than x.

Then, the minimal cost would be the number of cheap moves plus the direct distance to y from the final city.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that for each city x, I can move to its closest city, and keep moving via closest cities until I reach a city z where |a_z - a_y| < |a_x - a_y| - k, where k is the number of cheap moves.

Then, the minimal cost would be k + |a_z - a_y|.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

This seems too slow for the constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a graph with weight 1, and moving directly is like having a direct edge with weight equal to the distance.

Then, the minimal cost is the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1 and edges to all other cities with weights equal to their direct distances.

Then, the minimal cost is the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, building such a graph is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the direct distance minus the minimal distance saved by moving via the closest city.

The minimal distance saved would be the minimal difference between the direct move and the cheap move.

But I need to make this precise.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y as the minimal over all z of (1 + cost(z, y)), where z is the closest city to x.

But again, this leads to a recursive definition that is too slow to compute for each query.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step towards y, and I can model the movement as a sequence of cheap moves followed by a direct move.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimal over all k of (k + |a_y - a_z|), where z is the city reached after k cheap moves from x.

I need to find the minimal such sum.

But
