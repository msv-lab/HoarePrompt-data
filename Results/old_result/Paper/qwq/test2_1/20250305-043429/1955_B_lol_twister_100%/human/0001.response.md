Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's something called a "progressive square" which is an n x n matrix. Maxim chooses three integers: a_{1,1}, c, and d, and constructs this square based on some rules. From the example, when n=3, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, and d=3, the square looks like this:

But wait, the actual matrix isn't shown here. Maybe I need to figure out the rules for constructing the square.

Looking back at the problem, it seems like the elements of the square are generated using a_{1,1}, c, and d, but the exact rule isn't directly stated. However, from the example, I can try to deduce the pattern.

Given that it's a square matrix, each element can be identified by its row and column indices, say i and j, starting from 1.

Perhaps the general formula for the element at position (i, j) is a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d.

Let me test this with the example provided:

For n=3, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, d=3.

So,

a_{1,1} = 1 + 0*2 + 0*3 = 1

a_{1,2} = 1 + 0*2 + 1*3 = 4

a_{1,3} = 1 + 0*2 + 2*3 = 7

a_{2,1} = 1 + 1*2 + 0*3 = 3

a_{2,2} = 1 + 1*2 + 1*3 = 6

a_{2,3} = 1 + 1*2 + 2*3 = 9

a_{3,1} = 1 + 2*2 + 0*3 = 5

a_{3,2} = 1 + 2*2 + 1*3 = 8

a_{3,3} = 1 + 2*2 + 2*3 = 11

So the square should look like:

1, 4, 7

3, 6, 9

5, 8, 11

Now, comparing this with the first test case:

Input:

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

So, n=3, c=2, d=3, and the array is [3,9,6,5,7,1,10,4,8]

If I sort this array: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

And the progressive square elements sorted would be: [1,3,5,4,6,8,7,9,11]

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the square elements are: [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11], which sorted is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

But the input array sorted is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

So, the elements don't match because 10 is in the input but 11 is in the square.

Hence, it should be "NO", which matches the first output in the example.

In the second test case:

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8

Sorted: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

Which matches the progressive square elements, so "YES".

In the third test case:

2 100 100

400 300 400 500

Sorted: [300,400,400,500]

If a_{1,1}=x, c=100, d=100, then the square would be:

x, x+100

x+100, x+200

So, elements: x, x+100, x+100, x+200

Sorted: [x, x+100, x+100, x+200]

Comparing with [300,400,400,500], it seems x=300.

So, 300, 400, 400, 500 matches, so "YES".

Fourth test case:

3 2 3

3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8

Sorted: [1,3,4,5,6,6,8,9,11]

But the progressive square elements should be [1,3,5,4,6,8,7,9,11], sorted as [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

So, the input has two 6's but the square has one 6 and one 7, so doesn't match, "NO".

Fifth test case:

4 4 4

15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15

Sorted: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27]

If n=4, c=4, d=4, then the square would be:

a, a+4, a+8, a+12

a+4, a+8, a+12, a+16

a+8, a+12, a+16, a+20

a+12, a+16, a+20, a+24

So elements: a, a+4, a+8, a+12, a+4, a+8, a+12, a+16, a+8, a+12, a+16, a+20, a+12, a+16, a+20, a+24

Sorted: [a, a+4, a+4, a+8, a+8, a+8, a+12, a+12, a+12, a+12, a+16, a+16, a+16, a+20, a+20, a+24]

Comparing with [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27]

Assuming a=3, then the square elements would be:

3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27

Sorted: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27]

Which matches the input, so should be "YES". But in the example output, it's "NO". Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, if a=3, then:

First row: 3, 3+4=7, 7+4=11, 11+4=15 → 3,7,11,15

Second row: 3+4=7, 7+4=11, 11+4=15, 15+4=19 → 7,11,15,19

Third row: 3+8=11, 11+4=15, 15+4=19, 19+4=23 → 11,15,19,23

Fourth row: 3+12=15, 15+4=19, 19+4=23, 23+4=27 → 15,19,23,27

So all elements: 3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27

Sorted: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,23,27]

Which matches the input array, so it should be "YES". But in the example, it's "NO". Maybe there's a mistake in the example or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps there's a uniqueness constraint I'm missing. The problem says that for any values of n, a_{1,1}, c, d, there exists exactly one progressive square. But maybe there are constraints on the values that make the square valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements must be distinct, but in this case, they are not.

Wait, looking back, in the third test case, n=2, c=100, d=100, with array [400,300,400,500], which corresponds to a=300, and elements are [300,400,400,500], which matches, so "YES".

In the fifth test case, even with duplicates, it should be "YES", but the example output is "NO". So perhaps my understanding is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps the progressive square cannot have duplicate elements unless the formula dictates it. But in this case, with c=4 and d=4, duplicates can occur only if a + c*i + d*j are equal for different i,j.

In the fifth test case, with c=d=4, that would happen if c and d are multiples, leading to duplicates.

Wait, in the fourth row, a+12, a+16, a+20, a+24, and in the third row, a+12, a+16, a+20, so a+12 appears in multiple places.

But in the input array, the frequency of each number must match the frequency in the square.

In the fifth test case, a=3, so elements are:

3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27

So frequencies:

3:1

7:2

11:3

15:4

19:3

23:3

27:1

And the input array has:

3:1

7:2

11:3

15:4

19:2

23:3

27:1

Wait, 19 appears twice in the input, but in the square, it should appear three times. Hence, it's a mismatch, so "NO".

I missed that in my earlier analysis. So, even though the elements mostly match, the frequency of 19 is less in the input array than required by the square, hence "NO".

Okay, that makes sense now.

So, to solve this problem, I need to:

1. For each test case, given n, c, d, and an array of n^2 integers.

2. Determine if the array contains exactly the elements of the progressive square defined by a_{1,1}, c, d, where a_{1,1} is the minimum element in the square.

Wait, how do I find a_{1,1}? From the example, it seems a_{1,1} is the minimum element in the square.

Because in the first test case, a_{1,1}=1, which is the smallest element in the square.

Similarly, in the third test case, a_{1,1}=300, which is the smallest element.

So, I can find a_{1,1} as the minimum element in the input array, assuming that it's the smallest element in the square.

Then, generate all elements of the progressive square using the formula a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, for i,j from 1 to n.

Collect all these elements in a list, sort both the generated list and the input array, and check if they match.

But in the fifth test case, even with frequency matching, since the input array had only two 19's but the square requires three, it should be "NO".

Hence, I need to ensure that the frequencies of all elements match between the input array and the generated square.

Implementing this in code:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, c, d.

- Read the array of n^2 integers.

- Find a_{1,1} as the minimum element in the array.

- Generate the progressive square elements using a_{1,1}, c, d.

- Sort both the generated elements and the input array.

- Compare if they are equal.

- Output "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

But in the fifth test case, since the frequencies don't match, it's "NO", which matches the example output.

So, this approach seems correct.

Edge cases to consider:

- n=2, c=1, d=1, array=[1,2,2,3]. Here, a_{1,1}=1, generated square elements: [1,2,2,3], which matches the array, so "YES".

- n=2, c=1, d=1, array=[1,2,3,4]. Here, a_{1,1}=1, generated square elements: [1,2,2,3], which doesn't match the array, so "NO".

- n=2, c=0, d=0, array=[1,1,1,1]. Then a_{1,1}=1, generated square elements: [1,1,1,1], matches, "YES".

- n=2, c=0, d=0, array=[1,1,1,2]. Doesn't match, "NO".

- n=1, but according to constraints, n >=2, so no need to handle n=1.

- All elements in the array are the same, and match the generated square.

- Negative numbers: According to constraints, b_i >=1, c and d >=1, so no negatives to worry about.

- Large values: b_i up to 1e9, c and d up to 1e6, so need to ensure no integer overflows, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.

- Duplicate elements: As shown in the fifth test case, need to ensure frequencies match.

Implementing this in code:

- Read t.

- Loop t times:

- Read n, c, d.

- Read the array of n^2 elements.

- Find a_{1,1} as min(l).

- Generate the progressive square elements: a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d for i in 0 to n-1 and j in 0 to n-1.

- Sort both lists and compare.

- Output "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

In the provided code snippet:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):

a = min(l)

li = []

for k in range(0, n):

for h in range(0, n):

li.append(a + k * c + d * h)

li.sort()

l.sort()

if l == li:

return 'yes'

return 'no'

This seems to match my approach.

But in the example, for the fifth test case, it should return "NO", which it does, as per the frequency mismatch.

Hence, the program seems correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given array of numbers can form a "progressive square" based on the provided parameters. A progressive square is an n x n matrix constructed using specific rules involving the constants c and d, and an initial value a_{1,1}.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Progressive Square:**
   - The progressive square is generated using the formula: a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d for each element in the n x n matrix.
   - The value of a_{1,1} is determined as the minimum value in the provided array since it corresponds to the smallest element in the square.

2. **Steps for Each Test Case:**
   - Read the values of n, c, d, and the array.
   - Determine a_{1,1} as the minimum value in the array.
   - Generate the expected progressive square elements using the formula.
   - Sort both the generated elements and the provided array.
   - Compare the sorted arrays to check if they match.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + h * d)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases t.
   - For each test case, read n, c, d, and the array l.

2. **Generating the Progressive Square:**
   - Calculate a_{1,1} as the minimum value in l.
   - Use nested loops to generate the elements of the progressive square using the formula a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i)*c + (j)*d for i, j from 0 to n-1.

3. **Comparing Arrays:**
   - Sort both the generated list li and the input list l.
   - Compare the sorted lists to determine if they match. If they do, output "YES"; otherwise, output "NO".

This approach ensures that we correctly identify whether the given array can form the specified progressive square for each test case.
