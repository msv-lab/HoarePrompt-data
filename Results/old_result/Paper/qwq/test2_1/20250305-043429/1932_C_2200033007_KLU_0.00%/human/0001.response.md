Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array `a` of length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and a string `s` of commands, where each command is either 'L' or 'R'. For each command in the string `s`, I need to perform two actions:

1. Output the remainder of the product of all elements in the array `a` when divided by `m`.

2. Remove the leftmost element if the command is 'L', or the rightmost element if the command is 'R'.

And I have to do this for multiple test cases, with the guarantee that the total sum of `n` across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

First, I need to understand what the problem is really asking for. For each command in the string `s`, I need to output a number (the product modulo `m`) and then modify the array by removing an element from the left or right accordingly.

So, for each command, the array gets smaller by one element, and I need to compute the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` each time.

Looking at the example:

Input:

4

4 6

3 1 4 2

LRRL

...

Output:

0 2 4 1

...

In the first test case:

- Initial array: [3, 1, 4, 2], m=6

- First command 'L': product=3*1*4*2=24, 24 mod 6=0; then remove the leftmost element 3; array becomes [1,4,2]

- Second command 'R': product=1*4*2=8, 8 mod 6=2; remove the rightmost element 2; array becomes [1,4]

- Third command 'R': product=1*4=4, 4 mod 6=4; remove the rightmost element 4; array becomes [1]

- Fourth command 'L': product=1 mod 6=1; remove the leftmost element 1; array is empty

So, the output is 0 2 4 1, which matches the example.

Now, I need to think about how to implement this efficiently, especially considering that `n` can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, and the total sum of `n` across all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

A naive approach would be, for each command, to calculate the product of the current array modulo `m` and then remove the appropriate element. However, calculating the product from scratch each time would be too slow, as it would be O(n^2) time complexity, which is not acceptable for n=2*10^5.

I need a smarter way to compute the product modulo `m` each time, taking into account that the array is being reduced by one element at each step, either from the left or the right.

One idea is to precompute the product of the entire array, then, depending on the command, divide the product by the element being removed and take modulo `m`. However, division in modular arithmetic is not straightforward, especially since `m` could be any positive integer, not necessarily prime.

Wait, in modular arithmetic, division by a number `x` is equivalent to multiplying by the modular inverse of `x`, provided that `x` and `m` are coprime. But in this problem, `m` can be any positive integer up to 10^4, and the elements of the array can be up to 10^4, so there might be cases where elements and `m` are not coprime, making it impossible to compute the inverse.

Therefore, directly dividing in modular arithmetic might not always be possible.

Another approach is to maintain two separate products: one from the left and one from the right, and use them to compute the product of the remaining array at each step.

Wait, actually, since we're removing elements from either end, the remaining product can be thought of as a sliding window where elements are removed from one end or the other.

Let me think about this differently. Suppose I simulate the process of removing elements from either end, keeping track of the current product modulo `m`, and outputting it at each step.

But again, if I do it step by step, it might be too slow for large n.

Looking back at the example, perhaps there's a way to reorder the computations to make it more efficient.

Let's consider that the sequence of removals defines an order in which elements are removed from the array. If I can determine the order in which elements are removed, then the product at any step is the product of the elements that haven't been removed yet.

But computing the product of remaining elements directly would still be too slow if done naively.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the prefix and suffix products modulo `m`, and then use them to compute the product of the remaining array at each step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's compute:

- `prefix[i]`: product of the first `i` elements modulo `m`

- `suffix[i]`: product of the last `i` elements modulo `m`

Then, at each step, depending on whether I'm removing from the left or the right, I can compute the product of the remaining array by dividing the current product by the removed element, but again, division is tricky in modular arithmetic.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep track of the product of all remaining elements by multiplying the prefix and suffix products appropriately.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let's consider that the final product is the product of all elements except those that have been removed so far. If I can compute this efficiently, that would be great.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the array as being reduced step by step, and keep track of the product of the remaining elements.

But again, without efficient division, this seems challenging.

Let me consider another approach. Since the array is being reduced by removing elements from either end, perhaps I can simulate the process using two pointers: one for the left end and one for the right end.

Let's define:

- `left`: the current left pointer

- `right`: the current right pointer

Initially, `left = 0` and `right = n-1`.

At each step, depending on the command:

- If 'L', remove the element at `left` and increment `left`

- If 'R', remove the element at `right` and decrement `right`

Meanwhile, I need to compute the product of the elements from `left` to `right` inclusive, modulo `m`.

Computing this product directly at each step is too slow for large `n`.

Is there a way to compute this product efficiently?

One idea is to precompute the prefix products and suffix products modulo `m`, and then at each step, the product of the remaining array is `prefix[right] * suffix[left]` modulo `m`, divided by the product of elements from `left` to `right`, but that seems circular.

Wait, actually, prefix and suffix products overlap in the middle, so maybe that's not helpful.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can process the commands in reverse order.

Suppose I start with an empty array and add elements according to the reverse of the removal sequence.

That is, I can think of building the array back from empty to full, adding elements either to the left or to the right, in the reverse order of removal.

This might allow me to compute the product incrementally.

Let's try this.

If I reverse the sequence of commands, I can simulate adding elements back to the array, either to the left or to the right, and keep track of the product of the array at each step.

Then, the products I need to output are in reverse order as well.

So, the plan is:

1. Reverse the string `s` to get the addition sequence.

2. Initialize an empty array and a product variable, say `p`, set to 1.

3. Iterate through the reversed command sequence:

a. For each command:

i. Add the corresponding element to the array.

ii. Update the product `p` by multiplying with the added element, modulo `m`.

iii. Append `p` to a list.

4. Finally, reverse the list of products to get the correct order and output them.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic. Let's verify with the first example.

In the first test case:

Original commands: LRRL

Reversed commands: LRRL

Elements to add back: 2, then 4, then 1, then 3

Initialize empty array, p=1

- First command 'L': add 2 to the left, array=[2], p=1*2=2 mod 6=2

- Second command 'R': add 4 to the right, array=[2,4], p=2*4=8 mod 6=2

- Third command 'R': add 1 to the right, array=[2,4,1], p=2*1=2 mod 6=2

- Fourth command 'L': add 3 to the left, array=[3,2,4,1], p=2*3=6 mod 6=0

So, the list of p is [2,2,2,0], which reversed is [0,2,2,2]. But in the example, it's [0,2,4,1]. So, this approach is not giving the correct products.

Hmm, seems like this approach is flawed because the product is not being calculated correctly when adding elements back.

Let me think again.

Another idea: Since the operations are removing from either end, perhaps I can use a deque (double-ended queue) to simulate the removal process, and keep track of the product modulo `m` at each step.

But again, computing the product each time would be too slow.

Wait, maybe I can precompute the product of all elements, and then divide by the removed elements, but as I thought earlier, division is problematic in modular arithmetic when elements and `m` are not coprime.

Is there a way to handle the division in modular arithmetic even when the elements and `m` are not coprime?

Actually, in some cases, we can perform division by computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) and simplifying, but it's getting complicated.

Let me consider another angle. Since `m` can be up to 10^4 and `n` up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to handle the computations without exceeding time limits.

Perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements, and then for each step, divide by the removed element if possible, but as mentioned, division is tricky.

Wait, maybe I can compute the product modulo `m` incrementally, keeping track of the product and updating it as elements are removed.

But removing an element affects the product, and without efficient division, it's hard to update the product correctly.

Let me consider the fact that the array is being reduced step by step, and perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array in a smarter way.

Another idea: Since we're dealing with removals from either end, the remaining array at each step is always a subarray that is a prefix and a suffix.

Wait, no, that's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of segment trees or prefix/suffix products in a different way.

Let me consider precomputing the product of the entire array, and then keeping track of the product of removed elements.

But again, without division, it's hard to see how this helps.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all removed elements and then compute the product of the remaining array as (product of all elements) / (product of removed elements). But again, division is problematic.

Another idea: Since the array is being reduced by removing elements from either end, perhaps I can represent the remaining array as the intersection of the prefix and suffix.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion could be applied here, but it's getting too convoluted.

Let me think about the constraints again. `n` can be up to 2*10^5, and `m` up to 10^4. Time constraints are tight, so I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

Perhaps I can accept that computing the product modulo `m` at each step directly is unavoidable, and look for optimizations.

Wait, maybe I can precompute the product of all elements, and then, for each step, keep track of the product divided by the removed element, if possible.

But again, division is tricky.

Let me consider that in modular arithmetic, if `x` and `m` are coprime, then `x` has an inverse modulo `m`, and division by `x` is equivalent to multiplication by the inverse.

So, if `x` and `m` are coprime, I can compute `p / x mod m` as `p * inv(x) mod m`, where `inv(x)` is the modular inverse of `x` modulo `m`.

However, if `x` and `m` are not coprime, then `x` does not have an inverse modulo `m`, and division is not defined.

In such cases, I need to handle them differently.

Given that `m` can be up to 10^4 and `x` up to 10^4, it's possible that `x` and `m` are not coprime.

So, perhaps I can factor `m` into its prime factors and handle each prime factor separately, but this seems too complicated for the time constraints.

Is there a better way?

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the product and the greatest common divisor (GCD) with `m`, and adjust accordingly.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for each removal, if the removed element `x` and `m` are coprime, I can divide the current product by `x` (by multiplying with the inverse of `x` modulo `m`).

If `x` and `m` are not coprime, then I need to handle it differently.

In such cases, perhaps I can keep track of the product divided by the GCD of `x` and `m`, but this is getting too involved.

I think I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that since `m` is up to 10^4, which is manageable, perhaps I can compute the product modulo `m` in a way that avoids division altogether.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array directly without dividing, but in O(1) time per step.

How can I achieve that?

Another idea: Since the array is being reduced by removing elements from either end, perhaps I can represent the product of the remaining array as (product of all elements) divided by the product of removed elements, but again, division is problematic.

Wait, perhaps instead of dividing, I can compute the product of removed elements and then compute the product of the remaining array as (product of all elements) times (product of removed elements)^(-1) modulo `m`, but only if the product of removed elements is coprime with `m`.

But in general, it's not guaranteed that the product of removed elements is coprime with `m`.

This seems too risky.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can process the commands in reverse order, building the array back from empty to full, and keeping track of the product at each step.

Wait, I tried that earlier, but it didn't give the correct results.

In the first example, reversing the commands gave me [2,2,2,0], which is not matching the expected [0,2,4,1].

So, that approach is incorrect.

Let me consider simulating the process step by step, but finding a way to compute the product efficiently.

Given that `n` can be up to 2*10^5, and we have multiple test cases, I need an O(n) solution.

Perhaps I can collect all the removal commands first and determine the order in which elements are removed, and then compute the product of the remaining elements accordingly.

But again, computing the product of remaining elements directly is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products, and then for each step, determine which prefix and suffix products to multiply to get the product of the remaining array.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define:

- `prefix[i]`: product of the first `i` elements modulo `m`

- `suffix[i]`: product of the last `i` elements modulo `m`

Then, at any step, if I have removed `k` elements so far, the remaining array is from index `left` to `right`, and the product is `prefix[right+1] * suffix[left]` divided by `prefix[left] * suffix[right+1]`, but this seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the remaining array being a subarray from `left` to `right`, and compute its product using prefix products.

Actually, prefix products can be used to compute the product of any subarray, but in this case, since we're removing elements from either end, the remaining array is a subarray that changes dynamically.

But computing the product of a subarray using prefix products requires division, which again brings us back to the same problem.

I'm starting to think that there's no way around handling the division in modular arithmetic, even when elements and `m` are not coprime.

This seems quite involved, and I'm not sure how to handle it efficiently within the time constraints.

Maybe I need to accept that my initial approach is too slow and look for a different way to solve the problem.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to output the product modulo `m` at each step, and then remove an element.

Perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then, for each step, divide by the removed element if possible, otherwise set the product to zero or handle it differently.

But again, without proper division, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of all elements, and then, for each removed element, divide the product by that element if it's possible (i.e., if the element and `m` are coprime), otherwise set the product to zero.

But this might not always be correct, as there could be cases where the product is still defined even if elements and `m` are not coprime.

This is getting too complicated for my current understanding of modular arithmetic.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to compute the product modulo `m` at each step, and since `m` can be up to 10^4, perhaps I can handle the product computations efficiently by keeping track of the exponents of the prime factors of `m`.

In other words, factor `m` into its prime factors, and then keep track of the exponents of these primes in the product of the array.

But this seems too time-consuming, especially since `m` can have multiple prime factors, and `n` is large.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that once the product becomes zero modulo `m`, it will stay zero, because if any element is zero modulo `m`, the entire product will be zero.

But in the example, the product is not always zero, so that's not the case.

Looking back at the example:

n=4, m=6, a=[3,1,4,2], s=LRRL

- First product: 3*1*4*2=24, 24 mod 6=0

- Remove 'L': remove 3, array=[1,4,2]

- Second product:1*4*2=8, 8 mod 6=2

- Remove 'R': remove 2, array=[1,4]

- Third product:1*4=4, 4 mod 6=4

- Remove 'R': remove 4, array=[1]

- Fourth product:1 mod 6=1

So, the output is 0 2 4 1

In this case, the product modulo m changes at each step.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Another idea: Since the array is being reduced by removing elements from either end, perhaps I can represent the remaining array as a slice of the original array, and precompute the product of all possible slices.

But precomputing all possible slices would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

Wait, perhaps not all possible slices, but only the slices that correspond to the sequence of removals.

But I'm not sure how to implement that efficiently.

Let me consider that the sequence of removals defines a specific order in which elements are removed, so the remaining array at each step is uniquely determined.

Perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array at each step by keeping track of the product of the elements that haven't been removed yet.

But again, without efficient division, I don't see a straightforward way to do this.

Maybe I need to accept that my initial approach is too slow and look for a different way to solve the problem.

Let me consider that for each step, I need to output the product of the current array modulo m, and then remove an element.

Perhaps I can compute the product modulo m incrementally, by dividing out the removed element if possible.

But as I thought earlier, division is problematic when the removed element and m are not coprime.

Wait, perhaps I can handle the division in cases where the removed element and m are coprime, and set the product to zero otherwise.

But in the example, the product is not always zero, so that can't be right.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I compute the product of all elements modulo m, and then, for each step, I remove an element and update the product accordingly.

If the removed element is x, and the current product is p, then the new product should be p / x modulo m, if x and m are coprime.

If x and m are not coprime, then p / x modulo m is not defined, and I need to handle it differently.

In such cases, perhaps I can set the new product to zero.

But in the example, the product is not always zero, so this approach might not work.

Wait, in the first step, product is 24 mod 6=0, then remove 3, which is not coprime with 6, so set product to zero? But in the example, the next product is 8 mod 6=2, not zero.

So, this approach is incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that in modular arithmetic, if p is divisible by x, then p / x mod m is well-defined, even if x and m are not coprime.

In other words, if x divides p, then p / x is an integer, and we can take its modulo m.

So, perhaps I can check if p is divisible by x, and if so, set the new p to (p / x) mod m; otherwise, set p to zero.

But in the example, p=0, which is always divisible by x, since 0 divided by any x is 0.

Wait, but in the first step, p=0, remove x=3, 0 is divisible by 3, so p becomes 0 / 3 = 0 mod 6 = 0, but in the next step, p should be 8 mod 6=2, not zero.

So, this approach is incorrect.

I must be missing something.

Let me think again.

In the first step, p=24 mod 6=0, remove x=3.

Now, the remaining array is [1,4,2], whose product is 8, which is 2 mod 6.

But according to the approach of dividing p by x, p / x = 0 / 3 = 0, which is not matching the expected 2.

So, this approach doesn't work.

Perhaps I need to abandon this idea altogether.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be any positive integer up to 10^4, and the elements can be up to 10^4.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array directly, without trying to divide.

But for n=2*10^5, this would be too slow if done naively.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements, and then, for each step, compute the product of the remaining array by multiplying the precomputed products of certain subarrays.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that since m is up to 10^4, and n is up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to handle the computations.

Perhaps I can use the concept of modular multiplicative inverses only when possible, and handle the cases where inverses don't exist separately.

But this seems too involved for the time constraints.

Let me consider that in the problem, the product can be very large, up to (10^4)^(2*10^5), which is way beyond standard data types.

So, I need to compute the product modulo m at each step, but in a way that's efficient and handles the removal of elements correctly.

Given that, perhaps I can accept that my initial approach is too slow and look for a different way to solve the problem.

Wait, perhaps I can process the commands in reverse order, building the array back from empty to full, and keeping track of the product at each step.

Wait, I tried that earlier, but it didn't give the correct results.

In the first example, reversing the commands gave me [2,2,2,0], but the expected output is [0,2,4,1].

So, that approach is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can model the remaining array as a subarray defined by two pointers, left and right, and keep track of the product of elements between them.

But as I thought earlier, computing the product of a subarray at each step is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix products and suffix products modulo m, and then, for each step, determine which elements are remaining and compute their product using the prefix and suffix products.

But again, this seems too slow and prone to errors.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to output the product modulo m at each step, and then remove an element.

Perhaps I can simulate this process using a deque or two stacks, but I don't see an immediate way to make this efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can use a sliding window approach, where the window size decreases by one at each step, but I'm not sure.

Let me consider that in each step, the remaining array is either the previous remaining array minus the leftmost element or minus the rightmost element, depending on the command.

So, perhaps I can keep track of the product of the remaining array by dividing out the removed element if possible.

But again, division is problematic.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the problem expects us to compute the product modulo m at each step without worrying about the division issues, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array directly, by multiplying the elements that haven't been removed yet, but that would be too slow for large n.

Another idea: Since the array is being reduced step by step, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array using the Chinese Remainder Theorem by factoring m into its prime factors and computing the product modulo each prime power separately.

But this seems too complicated and time-consuming for the time constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that m can be up to 10^4, which is small, so perhaps I can compute the product modulo m directly at each step without trying to optimize it further.

But for n=2*10^5, this would still be too slow if done naively.

I need to find a way to compute the product of the remaining array efficiently, perhaps in O(1) time per step.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements, and then, for each step, divide out the removed element if it's possible, otherwise set the product to zero.

But as I saw in the example, this doesn't work because it doesn't match the expected output.

Wait, maybe I need to handle the cases where the removed element and m are not coprime differently.

In such cases, perhaps I can compute the GCD of the removed element and m, and adjust the product accordingly.

For example, divide both the product and m by the GCD, and then proceed.

But this seems too involved and error-prone.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be up to 10^4, which is small, so perhaps I can compute the product modulo m directly in O(1) time per step, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product of the remaining array by multiplying the elements as I go, but I need a way to remove elements efficiently.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the product of the remaining array by maintaining a list of the remaining elements and computing their product modulo m at each step.

But for n=2*10^5, this would be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the problem is designed to be solved in a certain way, and perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Maybe there's a simple observation that I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that in each step, the remaining array is a subarray defined by the removal sequence, and perhaps there's a pattern or formula that allows me to compute the product modulo m efficiently.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that since m is small (up to 10^4), and n is up to 2*10^5, perhaps I can handle the product computations in a way that takes advantage of m being small.

But I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array using logarithms, but in modular arithmetic, that's not straightforward.

This is getting too complicated.

So, that approach is incorrect.

Let me consider that the problem might require a different mathematical approach or observation.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the product of the remaining array at each step is equal to the product of all elements divided by the product of removed elements, but again, division is problematic.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product of the remaining array by multiplying the prefix and suffix products in a certain way, but I'm not sure.

Given that time is limited, perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach is too slow and look for a different way to solve the problem.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the product of the remaining array can be computed using the formula:

product_remaining = (product_all * inverse(product_removed)) mod m

But again, computing the inverse is only possible if product_removed and m are coprime, which may not always be the case.

In such cases, perhaps I can set the product to zero, but as we've seen, that doesn't match the expected output.

Given that, perhaps I need to abandon this approach altogether.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be up to 10^4, which is small, and n is up to 2*10^5, so perhaps I can handle the product computations efficiently by keeping track of the exponents of the prime factors of m.

Another idea: Since the array is being reduced by removing elements from either end, perhaps I can represent the remaining array as a combination of prefix and suffix products, and compute the product accordingly.

But I'm not sure how to make this work.

Given that, perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach is too slow and look for a different way to solve the problem.

Wait, perhaps I can process the commands in reverse order and build the array back from empty to full, keeping track of the product at each step.

But earlier, this didn't give the correct results.

In the first example, it gave me [2,2,2,0], but the expected output is [0,2,4,1], which doesn't match.

So, that approach is incorrect.

Let me consider that perhaps the problem can be solved by computing the product of the remaining array using logarithms, but in modular arithmetic, that's not straightforward.

This is getting too complicated.

I need to find a simpler way.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach is too slow and look for a different way to solve the problem.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the product of the remaining array at each step can be computed using the formula:

product_remaining = (product_all * inverse(product_removed)) mod m

But again, computing the inverse is only possible if product_removed and m are coprime, which may not always be the case.

In such cases, perhaps I can set the product to zero, but in the example, that doesn't match the expected output.

Given that, perhaps I need to abandon this approach altogether.

Let me consider that in the problem, m can be up to 10^4, which is small, and n is up to 2*10^5, so perhaps I can handle the product computations efficiently by keeping track of the exponents of the prime factors of m.

In other words, factor m into its prime factors and keep track of the exponents of these primes in the product of the array.

But this seems too time-consuming and complex for the time constraints.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can accept that the problem is designed to be solved in a certain way, and perhaps I'm missing a key observation.

Let me consider that since m is small, I can compute the product of the remaining array directly modulo m at each step without trying to optimize it further.
