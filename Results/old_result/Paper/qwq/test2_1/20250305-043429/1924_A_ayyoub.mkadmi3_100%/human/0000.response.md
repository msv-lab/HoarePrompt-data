Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. I need to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I have to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete 'e' and 'd' to get "abc".

Now, the problem is asking me to check if all possible strings of length n using the first k letters of the alphabet are subsequences of s. The alphabet here is the first k lowercase English letters, so for k=2, it's 'a' and 'b'; for k=3, it's 'a', 'b', and 'c', and so on.

Given that n can be up to 26 and m up to 1000, and the total sum of m and n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^6, I need to make sure my solution is efficient.

Let me look at the example provided to understand better.

In the first test case:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

Possible strings of length 2 using 'a' and 'b': "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

I need to check if all of these are subsequences of "abba".

- "aa": positions 1 and 3 (s[1]='a', s[3]='a')

- "ab": positions 1 and 2 (s[1]='a', s[2]='b')

- "ba": positions 2 and 3 (s[2]='b', s[3]='a')

- "bb": positions 2 and 4 (s[2]='b', s[4]='b')

All of them are present, so the answer is YES.

In the second test case:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

Possible strings: same as above, "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

- "aa": positions 1 and 3 (s[1]='a', s[3]='b') – wait, s[3]='b', so no "aa"

So, "aa" is not a subsequence, hence NO, and then "aa" is provided.

In the third test case:

n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

Possible strings: all combinations of 'a', 'b', 'c' of length 3, like "aaa", "aab", "abc", etc., total 3^3=27 strings.

I need to check if all these 27 are subsequences of "aabbccabab". Apparently, "ccc" is not present, hence NO, and "ccc" is provided.

So, the task is to check for all possible n-length strings from the first k letters and see if they are subsequences of s. If any is missing, return NO and that string.

But generating all possible strings and checking each one would be too slow because k^n can be up to 26^26, which is way too big.

I need a smarter way to check this.

Let me think about it differently. Instead of generating all possible strings, maybe I can analyze the string s and see if it contains enough variations to cover all possible subsequences of length n.

One approach could be to model this as a graph where each node represents a state of the subsequence being built. This sounds like a dynamic programming problem.

Let's consider building the subsequence step by step. For each position in s, I can decide whether to include it in the subsequence or not, as long as the order is maintained.

But even with DP, checking for all possible subsequences directly isn't feasible due to time constraints.

I need to find a way to determine if s contains all possible n-length subsequences from the first k letters.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can think about the minimal requirements for s to contain all possible subsequences.

For example, for n=1, s must contain all k letters at least once.

For n=2, s must contain all possible pairs of the k letters, in order.

For n=3, all possible triplets, and so on.

But checking this directly is still too slow.

Another idea: For s to contain all possible n-length subsequences from k letters, it must be rich enough in variations of these letters.

Perhaps I can calculate the number of distinct subsequences of length n in s and see if it matches k^n.

But calculating the number of distinct subsequences of length n in s is also computationally intensive for large m and n.

I need a more efficient way.

Let's consider the following approach:

- Precompute the positions of each character in s.

- For each possible n-length string, check if there exists a subsequence in s that matches it.

But again, this would be too slow for large n and k.

Alternative idea:

- Use a sliding window approach to keep track of the possible subsequences.

- Maintain a DP array where dp[i][j] represents whether we can form the first i characters of the target string using the first j characters of s.

But this still seems too slow for the given constraints.

I need to find a smarter way to handle this.

Let me consider the properties of the string s.

If s contains all possible n-length subsequences from the first k letters, then for any sequence of n letters from the first k, there should be positions in s where these letters appear in that order.

To check this efficiently, perhaps I can precompute for each character how many times it appears in s, and ensure that there are enough repetitions to cover all possible combinations.

But I think this is still not precise enough.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each character needs to appear in s to cover all possible combinations.

For example, for n=2 and k=2, s must contain at least two 'a's and two 'b's to cover "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

But in the first test case, "abba" has two 'a's and two 'b's, which is sufficient.

In the second test case, "abb" has one 'a' and two 'b's, which is insufficient for "aa".

But wait, "aa" requires two 'a's at different positions, but there's only one 'a' in "abb", so it's impossible.

So, perhaps the number of times each character appears in s needs to be at least n for all characters.

But that can't be right, because for n=2, k=2, s="aabb" would suffice, but in the first test case, s="abba" also works with two 'a's and two 'b's.

Wait, but in "abb", there's only one 'a', so it can't form "aa".

So, maybe for each character, the number of occurrences in s needs to be at least the number of times it appears in the target subsequence.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the positions where each character appears in s.

Then, for a given target subsequence, I need to find positions in s that match the target in order.

To check if all possible n-length sequences are present, I need to ensure that s is rich enough in variations.

But this is still not concrete enough.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal string that contains all possible n-length subsequences.

This sounds similar to a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of a certain length appears exactly once.

But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using automata or graph theory, where nodes represent states of the subsequence being built, and edges represent the addition of a character.

This sounds like a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) where each path represents a possible subsequence.

But I need to find a way to check if all possible paths of length n are covered in s.

This seems complicated.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand how it approaches the problem.

Looking at the given program:

t = int(input())

OUT = []

for _ in range(t):

(n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())

s = input()

(b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)

if not b:

OUT.append('No')

i = 97

while i <= k + 97:

if chr(i) not in s1:

break

i += 1

be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))

OUT.append(s2 + be9i)

else:

OUT.append('Yes')

for i in OUT:

print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):

s1 = ''

s2 = ''

alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}

for i in s:

if i in alphabet:

if len(alphabet) != 1:

alphabet.remove(i)

else:

s2 += i

alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}

s1 += i

r = len(s1) // k

return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)

Okay, so there's a function func_1 that processes the string s, and based on its output, it decides whether to print YES or NO, and if NO, it constructs a string that's missing.

Let me try to understand func_1.

It initializes s1 and s2 as empty strings and creates a set alphabet containing the first k lowercase letters.

Then, it iterates through each character in s:

- If the character is in alphabet:

- If the alphabet has more than one character, it removes the character from the alphabet.

- If the alphabet has only one character, it appends the character to s2 and resets the alphabet to the full set of first k letters.

- In either case, it appends the character to s1.

After processing the string, it calculates r as the integer division of the length of s1 by k.

Then, it returns a tuple: (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)

So, the main check is whether len(s1) is at least n * k.

If it is, it's considered correct; otherwise, it's incorrect, and it constructs a missing string.

In the case of incorrect, it finds the smallest available character not in s1 and constructs a string of length n using that character.

Wait, but in the example where n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb", it should return NO and "aa".

In this case, s1 would be "abb" processed as follows:

- s1 starts empty.

- 'a': in alphabet {'a','b'}, len(alphabet) !=1, so remove 'a', s1='a', alphabet={'b'}

- 'b': in alphabet {'b'}, len(alphabet)==1, so append 'b' to s2, reset alphabet to {'a','b'}, s1='ab'

- 'b': in alphabet {'a','b'}, len(alphabet)!=1, remove 'b', s1='ab'b, alphabet={'a'}

So, s1='abb', s2='b'

r = len(s1)//k = 3//2=1

So, return (len(s1)>=2*2, s1[2:], s2) => (3>=4, 'b', 'b') => (False, 'b', 'b')

Then, it appends 'No', and tries to find a character from 'a' to 'b' not in s1='abb'.

' a' is in s1, 'b' is in s1, so it can't find any, but according to the note, "aa" is missing.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

In the line:

i = 97

while i <= k + 97:

if chr(i) not in s1:

break

i += 1

be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))

OUT.append(s2 + be9i)

So, for k=2, it loops from 'a' (97) to 'b' (98).

Checks if 'a' is not in s1='abb' – 'a' is present.

Then i=98, 'b' is in s1.

Then it seems it should proceed to i=99, which is 'c', but k=2, so it stops at 'b'.

Then be9i = 'c' * (2 - len('b')) = 'c' * 1 = 'c'

Then OUT.append('b' + 'c') => 'bc'

But in the example, it should be 'aa'.

This doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the logic.

Let me look again.

Wait, be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))

In this case, n=2, len(s2)=1, so be9i = 'c' * 1 = 'c'

Then, OUT.append(s2 + be9i) = 'b' + 'c' = 'bc'

But in the example, it should be 'aa'.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to see the full execution.

Let me try another example.

Take the third test case:

n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

Process func_1:

s1='', s2='', alphabet={'a','b','c'}

- 'a': in alphabet, len(alphabet)!=1, remove 'a', s1='a', alphabet={'b','c'}

- 'a': 'a' not in alphabet={'b','c'}, so skip

- 'b': in alphabet={'b','c'}, len(alphabet)!=1, remove 'b', s1='ab', alphabet={'c'}

- 'b': 'b' not in alphabet={'c'}, skip

- 'c': in alphabet={'c'}, len(alphabet)==1, append 'c' to s2, reset alphabet={'a','b','c'}, s1='ab'+'c'='abc'

- 'c': in alphabet={'a','b','c'}, len(alphabet)!=1, remove 'c', s1='abc'+'c'='abcc', alphabet={'a','b'}

- 'a': in alphabet={'a','b'}, len(alphabet)!=1, remove 'a', s1='abcc'+'a'='abcca', alphabet={'b'}

- 'b': in alphabet={'b'}, len(alphabet)==1, append 'b' to s2, reset alphabet={'a','b','c'}, s1='abcca'+'b'='abccab'

- 'a': in alphabet={'a','b','c'}, len(alphabet)!=1, remove 'a', s1='abccab'+'a'='abccaba', alphabet={'b','c'}

- 'b': in alphabet={'b','c'}, len(alphabet)!=1, remove 'b', s1='abccaba'+'b'='abccabab', alphabet={'c'}

So, s1='abccabab', s2='c'+'b'='cb'

r = len(s1)//k = 8//3=2

So, s1[r*k:] = s1[6:] = 'abab'

Return (len(s1)>=3*3, s1[6:], s2) => (8>=9, 'abab', 'cb') => (False, 'abab', 'cb')

Then, it appends 'No', and tries to find a character from 'a' to 'c' not in s1='abccabab'.

' a' is in s1, 'b' is in s1, 'c' is in s1, so i=100, which is 'd', but k=3, so it stops at 'c'.

Then be9i = 'd' * (3 - len('cb')) = 'd' * 1 = 'd'

Then OUT.append('cb' + 'd') = 'cb' + 'd' = 'cbbd'

But in the example, it should be 'ccc'.

Again, doesn't match.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Looking back at the problem, it says "the first k lowercase English alphabets", so for k=3, it's 'a','b','c'.

In the third test case, "aabbccabab", which contains 'a','b','c', but "ccc" is missing.

But according to the function, s1='abccabab', which contains 'c's, but it's considering the entire sequence.

I think the logic in func_1 is flawed.

Let me see what the function is trying to do.

It seems to be trying to build s1 by removing characters from the alphabet set until only one remains, then resetting the set.

But this doesn't directly relate to checking for all possible subsequences.

I think the approach is incorrect, hence the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
