Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. That means it's a complete graph with n nodes, right? So, the number of bridges is n*(n-1)/2, which makes sense.

Everule lives on island 1 and wants to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach. Our job is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, given that Dominater acts optimally.

First, I need to understand what it means for Dominater to act optimally. Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, so he should try to cut off as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying bridges.

In graph terms, I think this is about disconnecting islands from island 1 by removing bridges (edges). The goal is to find the smallest connected component that includes island 1 after removing up to k bridges.

Let me think about how to approach this. In a complete graph, every island is directly connected to every other island. So, to isolate island 1 from other islands, Dominater would need to remove all bridges connected to island 1.

Wait, no. Actually, to isolate island 1, Dominater would need to remove all bridges connected to island 1. Since island 1 is connected to n-1 other islands, there are n-1 bridges connected to it. So, if Dominater removes all these n-1 bridges, Everule can only stay on island 1.

But the problem allows Dominater to remove at most k bridges. So, if k is at least n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 completely. Otherwise, Everule can still reach at least some other islands.

Wait, but the problem says "minimize the number of islands that Everule can reach". So, Dominater wants to make the connected component containing island 1 as small as possible.

In a complete graph, to minimize the size of the connected component containing island 1, Dominater can try to separate off other islands by removing bridges.

Let me consider that in a complete graph, any subset of islands can be separated from island 1 by removing certain bridges.

Suppose Dominater wants to separate m islands from island 1. To do that, he needs to remove all bridges between those m islands and island 1. Since each of those m islands has a direct bridge to island 1, he needs to remove m bridges.

Additionally, since the graph is complete, there are bridges between these m islands themselves, but those don't directly affect island 1's connection to them.

So, to separate m islands from island 1, Dominater needs to remove m bridges (the ones connecting those m islands to island 1).

Therefore, with k bridges to remove, the maximum number of islands he can separate is k, because each separated island requires one bridge to be removed (the one directly connecting it to island 1).

Wait, but that seems too simplistic. Let me think again.

If Dominater removes k bridges, each of which is connected to island 1, he can separate k islands from island 1. But actually, in a complete graph, removing one bridge only breaks one connection, but since there are multiple paths, Everule might still reach those islands through other paths.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

In a complete graph, to separate a set of islands from island 1, Dominater needs to remove all bridges connecting those islands to island 1.

Suppose Dominater wants to separate s islands from island 1. Each of these s islands is connected to island 1 by a bridge, so he needs to remove s bridges to achieve this.

If k >= s, he can separate s islands by removing s bridges. But he might be able to separate more islands by removing bridges in a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps there's a better strategy.

Let's consider that in a complete graph, any subset of islands is fully connected among themselves. So, even if Dominater removes some bridges, the remaining islands are still fully connected.

Therefore, the only way to disconnect islands from island 1 is to remove bridges connecting them directly to island 1.

So, to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, Dominater should try to isolate as many islands as possible by removing bridges connected to island 1.

Given that, the minimal number of islands Everule can reach is 1 plus the number of islands that cannot be separated due to the bridge limit k.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the complement: the number of islands that can be separated by removing k bridges.

Each island can be separated by removing one bridge (the direct connection to island 1). So, with k bridges to remove, Dominater can separate at most k islands.

Therefore, the minimal number of islands Everule can reach is (n - k), because k islands are separated, and Everule can reach the remaining n - k islands including island 1.

But looking back at the example, in the second test case, n=2 and k=1, the output is 1, meaning only island 1 is reachable.

According to the above logic, n - k = 1, which matches the example.

In the third test case, n=4 and k=1, the output is 4, meaning all islands are reachable.

According to n - k = 3, but the output is 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Looking back, in the third test case, n=4 and k=1.

According to the explanation in the note, even if Dominater destroys one bridge, say between islands 1 and 2, Everule can still reach island 2 via island 3.

So, in a complete graph, removing one bridge doesn't disconnect any island; there are always multiple paths.

Therefore, my previous assumption that removing k bridges can separate k islands is incorrect.

In fact, in a complete graph, removing up to n-1 bridges doesn't disconnect the graph. The graph remains connected unless Dominater removes all n-1 bridges connected to island 1.

Wait, but in a complete graph with n islands, removing any n-1 bridges doesn't necessarily disconnect the graph, because there are multiple paths between islands.

Actually, in a complete graph, the graph remains connected unless all bridges connected to a particular island are removed.

So, to disconnect island 1 from the rest, Dominater needs to remove all n-1 bridges connected to island 1.

If k < n-1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, and Everule can reach all other islands.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 by removing n-1 bridges, and then Everule can only stay on island 1.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=4 and k=1, and n-1=3, since k=1 < 3, Everule can reach all islands, which matches the output of 4.

In the fourth test case, n=5 and k=10, which is more than n-1=4, so Everule can only stay on island 1, which matches the output of 1.

In the fifth test case, n=5 and k=3, which is less than n-1=4, so Everule can reach all islands, which matches the output of 5.

Wait, but in the sixth test case, n=4 and k=4, which is greater than n-1=3, so Everule can only stay on island 1, which matches the output of 1.

So, the general rule seems to be:

- If k >= n-1, Everule can only stay on island 1.

- Otherwise, Everule can reach all n islands.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=2 and k=1, n-1=1, so k >= n-1, and Everule can only stay on island 1, which matches the output of 1.

In the first test case, n=2 and k=0, k < n-1=1, so Everule can reach all islands, which is 2.

This seems consistent.

So, the minimal number of islands Everule can reach is:

- 1, if k >= n-1

- n, otherwise

This seems to match all the test cases.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

- Calculate n-1, which is the number of bridges connected to island 1.

- If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 by removing all its connections, so Everule can only stay on island 1.

- If k < n-1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, so Everule can reach all islands.

Hence, the minimal number of islands Everule can reach is:

1 if k >= n-1 else n

Looking back at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)

Wait, this seems to be checking if n - k <= 1, then print 1, else print n.

But according to my reasoning, it should be:

print(1 if k >= n-1 else n)

Which is equivalent to:

print(n if k < n-1 else 1)

But the given code is:

print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)

Is this equivalent?

Let's see:

n - k <= 1 is equivalent to k >= n - 1.

Because n - k <= 1 => -k <= 1 - n => k >= n - 1

Yes, that's correct.

So, the given code is:

print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1)

Wait, no, wait:

n - k <= 1 is equivalent to k >= n - 1.

So, print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1)

Wait, but in the code, it's print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1), which is the same as print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1).

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be print(1 if k >= n - 1 else n)

So, there seems to be a discrepancy here.

Wait, no, actually, print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1) is the same as print(1 if k < n - 1 else n), which is not the same as my earlier conclusion.

Wait, I think I made a mistake.

I said that if k >= n - 1, print 1, else print n.

But the code is printing n if k >= n - 1 else 1.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought.

Wait, no, let's see:

n - k <= 1 is equivalent to k >= n - 1.

So, print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1)

But according to my reasoning, when k >= n - 1, print 1, else print n.

So, the code is doing the opposite.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading it.

Wait, in the code:

print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)

n - k <= 1 is equivalent to k >= n - 1.

So, print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1)

But according to my earlier reasoning, when k >= n - 1, Everule can only stay on island 1, so should print 1.

When k < n - 1, Everule can reach all n islands, so print n.

But the code is printing n when k >= n - 1, which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check this.

In the second test case, n=2, k=1.

n - 1 = 1, k >= n - 1, so print 1, which matches the expected output of 1.

In the first test case, n=2, k=0.

k < n - 1, so print n=2, which matches the expected output of 2.

In the third test case, n=4, k=1.

k < n - 1=3, so print n=4, which matches the expected output of 4.

In the fourth test case, n=5, k=10.

k >= n - 1=4, so print 1, which matches the expected output of 1.

In the fifth test case, n=5, k=3.

k < n - 1=4, so print n=5, which matches the expected output of 5.

In the sixth test case, n=4, k=4.

k >= n - 1=3, so print 1, which matches the expected output of 1.

Wait, but according to this, the code is doing it correctly.

Wait, in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10.

n - 1=4, k=10 >=4, so print 1.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=4, k=1, k=1 < 3, so print 4.

This seems correct.

But according to my earlier reasoning, I thought it should be print(1 if k >= n - 1 else n)

But the code is print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1)

Wait, no, that's not what the code says.

Wait, the code says:

print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)

n - k <= 1 is equivalent to k >= n - 1.

So, print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1)

But according to the examples, when k >= n - 1, print 1, else print n.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10, which is k >= n - 1=4, so print 1.

In the fifth test case, n=5, k=3, k < n - 1=4, so print 5.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=4, k=1, k < n - 1=3, so print 4.

Second test case, n=2, k=1, k >= n - 1=1, so print 1.

First test case, n=2, k=0, k < n - 1=1, so print 2.

Sixth test case, n=4, k=4, k >= n - 1=3, so print 1.

All of these match the expected outputs.

So, the code is correct.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be print(1 if k >= n - 1 else n)

But the code is print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1), which is the opposite.

But according to the test cases, it's still producing the correct output.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I misread the condition.

Let me rephrase:

If k >= n - 1, then print 1, else print n.

But the code is print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1), which is equivalent to print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1), which matches my reasoning.

Wait, but in the code, it's n - k <= 1, which is equivalent to k >= n - 1.

So, it's correctly implementing print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1)

But according to the test cases, this is producing the correct outputs.

Wait, but logically, if k >= n - 1, Everule can only stay on island 1, so should print 1.

If k < n - 1, Everule can reach all islands, so print n.

Therefore, the correct implementation should be print(1 if k >= n - 1 else n)

But the code is print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1), which is the opposite.

Wait, no, in code, it's print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1), which is equivalent to print(n if k >= n - 1 else 1)

Wait, that's not matching my logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect.

Let me take an example.

Take n=4, k=1.

n - k = 3, which is not <=1, so print 1, but according to the expected output, it should be 4.

Wait, no, in the third test case, n=4, k=1, output is 4.

But according to the code, n - k =3 <=1? No, so print 1, but expected is 4.

Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the code.

Wait, the code says n - k <=1, which for n=4, k=1, 4 -1=3 <=1? No, so print 1, but expected is 4.

So, it's wrong.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was correct, but according to this, it's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the condition.

Wait, maybe it's a mistake in the code.

Let me think again.

If k >= n -1, Dominater can isolate island 1, so Everule can only stay on island 1.

If k < n -1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1, so Everule can reach all n islands.

Therefore, the correct implementation should be:

if k >= n -1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

But the code is:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which is equivalent to:

if n - k <=1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

But n - k <=1 is equivalent to k >= n -1.

So, it's actually:

if k >= n -1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

Which is the opposite of what it should be.

But according to the test cases, it's producing the correct outputs.

Wait, in the third test case, n=4, k=1, k < n-1=3, so should print n=4, which it does.

In the fourth test case, n=5, k=10, k >= n-1=4, so should print 1, which matches the output of 1.

Wait, but according to the code, when k >= n-1, it prints n, but according to the correct logic, it should print 1.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, let's see:

n - k <=1 is equivalent to k >= n -1.

So, if k >= n -1, print n, else print 1.

But according to the correct logic, if k >= n -1, print 1, else print n.

So, the code is incorrect.

But in the test cases, it's producing the correct outputs.

Wait, in the third test case, n=4, k=1, k < n-1=3, so should print n=4, and the code prints 4.

In the fourth test case, n=5, k=10, k >= n-1=4, so should print 1, and the code prints n=5, but the expected output is 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was matching, but actually, in the fourth test case, the code would print n=5, but the expected output is 1.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in my earlier interpretation.

Wait, looking back at the test cases:

Input:

6

2 0

2 1

4 1

5 10

5 3

4 4

Output:

2

1

4

1

5

1

Now, for n=5, k=10, which is k=10 >= n-1=4, so according to the correct logic, should print 1, and according to the code, it would print n=5, but in the test case output, it's 1.

Wait, but according to the note in the problem, in the fourth test case, when n=5 and k=10, which is k=10 >= n-1=4, Everule can only stay on island 1, so output should be 1.

But according to the code, it's printing n=5, which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the test case output, it's 1, not 5.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the test case explanation.

Wait, in the note for the fourth test case, it says "Everule always has a way of reaching all islands despite what Dominater does", but in reality, if k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1.

Wait, perhaps the note is incorrect or I misread it.

Wait, in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10, which is k=10 >= n-1=4, so Dominater can isolate island 1 by removing 4 bridges, and the remaining 6 bridges don't affect the isolation.

So, Everule can only stay on island 1.

Hence, the correct output should be 1.

But according to the code, it's print(n if k >= n-1 else 1), which would print n=5 if k >= n-1, which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the test case output, it's 1, which suggests that the code is actually correct, but my earlier analysis was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the code again.

The code is:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which is equivalent to:

if n - k <=1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

Which is the same as:

if k >= n -1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

But according to the correct logic, it should be:

if k >= n -1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

So, the code seems incorrect.

But in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10, n - k =5 -10=-5 <=1, so print n=5, but expected output is 1.

Wait, but according to the test case output, it's 1, not 5.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the test case output I recalled.

Wait, looking back at the original problem, in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10, output is 1.

But according to the code, it should print n=5, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there is an error in the code.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the code.

Wait, the code is:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

But n - k <=1 is equivalent to k >= n -1.

So, if k >= n -1, print n, else print 1.

But according to the correct logic, it should be print 1 if k >= n -1, else print n.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

However, in the fourth test case, the output is 1, which suggests that perhaps the code is being run differently.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem's test case output.

Wait, no, in the problem's test case output for the fourth case, it's 1, which contradicts the code's output.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the condition.

Wait, perhaps in the code, it's a typo, and it should be print(n if k < n -1 else 1)

But it's written as print(n if n - k <=1 else 1), which is equivalent to print(n if k >= n -1 else 1), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit, given that Dominater can destroy at most \( k \) bridges in a fully connected graph of \( n \) islands.

### Approach
