Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins.

My task is to determine if it's possible for Bob to set up the stalls and set their prices in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices. If not, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. Alice will always buy jewels from the stalls in the order they're set up, buying as many as she can at each stall before moving to the next one. So, the sequence of stall prices matters because it affects how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall.

Given that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, and each stall can have a different price, I need to find a combination of stall prices that leads Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

Let me think about some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

3

7 3

6 4

255 8

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

NO

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

In the first test case, with n=7 coins and k=3 jewels, the output suggests setting up 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11 coins per jewel. Alice would buy 3 jewels in total.

Let's simulate this:

- Stall 1: price = 2 coins/jewel

Alice can buy 7 // 2 = 3 jewels, spending 6 coins. She has 1 coin left.

- Since she has only 1 coin left, she can't buy any jewels from the remaining stalls.

Total jewels bought: 3, which matches k=3.

In the third test case, n=255 coins and k=8 jewels.

The output suggests setting up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 coins per jewel.

Let's simulate this:

- Stall 1: price = 128 coins/jewel

Alice can buy 255 // 128 = 1 jewel, spending 128 coins. She has 127 coins left.

- Stall 2: price = 64 coins/jewel

Buy 127 // 64 = 1 jewel, spending 64 coins. Left with 63 coins.

- Stall 3: 32 coins/jewel

Buy 63 // 32 = 1 jewel, spending 32 coins. Left with 31 coins.

- Stall 4: 16 coins/jewel

Buy 31 // 16 = 1 jewel, spending 16 coins. Left with 15 coins.

- Stall 5: 8 coins/jewel

Buy 15 // 8 = 1 jewel, spending 8 coins. Left with 7 coins.

- Stall 6: 4 coins/jewel

Buy 7 // 4 = 1 jewel, spending 4 coins. Left with 3 coins.

- Stall 7: 2 coins/jewel

Buy 3 // 2 = 1 jewel, spending 2 coins. Left with 1 coin.

- Stall 8: 1 coin/jewel

Buy 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, spending 1 coin. Left with 0 coins.

Total jewels bought: 8, which matches k=8.

Now, in the second test case, n=6 coins and k=4 jewels, the output is "NO", meaning it's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels.

I need to think about why that is.

If I try to set up stalls with prices like 2, 2, 2, 2:

- Stall 1: 2 coins/jewel

Alice buys 6 // 2 = 3 jewels, spending 6 coins. She has 0 coins left.

- Can't buy from other stalls.

Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Alternatively, set up stalls with prices 1,1,1,1:

- Stall 1: 1 coin/jewel

Buy 6 // 1 = 6 jewels, spending 6 coins.

- Already bought more than 4 jewels.

No way to get exactly 4 jewels.

Another attempt: prices 1,2,3,4

- Stall 1: 1 coin/jewel

Buy 6 // 1 = 6 jewels, spending 6 coins.

- Again, too many jewels.

Seems like it's impossible to get exactly 4 jewels with any setup of stalls, hence "NO".

From these examples, I can see that the key is to control how many jewels Alice buys at each stall by setting appropriate prices.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func_1(n, k):

if n == k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(1)

return

if n < k:

print('NO')

return

costs = [n - k + 1, 1]

h = 0

for i in costs:

curr = n // i

h += curr

n -= i * curr

if h < k:

print('NO')

else:

print(2)

print('YES')

print(*costs)

Wait, this seems incomplete or incorrect.

First, it checks if n == k. If so, it sets up one stall with price 1, which makes Alice buy n jewels, which equals k. That part seems correct.

If n < k, it's impossible since Alice can't buy more jewels than the number of coins she has if each jewel costs at least 1 coin. So, "NO" is correct in this case.

Then, it sets up costs = [n - k + 1, 1]. So, two stalls: one with price p1 = n - k + 1 and another with p2 = 1.

Then, it calculates how many jewels Alice can buy:

- From stall 1: curr = n // p1

- Buy curr jewels, spend p1 * curr coins

- Update n -= p1 * curr

- Then, from stall 2: curr = n // p2, but since p2 = 1, she can buy up to n jewels.

- Total jewels h = curr (from stall 1) + curr (from stall 2)

If h < k, print "NO", else print "YES" and the prices [p1, p2]

Wait, but in the first example, k=3, n=7, p1=7-3+1=5, p2=1

- Stall 1: 7 // 5 = 1 jewel, spend 5 coins, left with 2 coins

- Stall 2: 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, spend 2 coins, left with 0 coins

- Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3

In the third example, n=255, k=8, p1=255-8+1=248, p2=1

- Stall 1: 255 // 248 = 1 jewel, spend 248 coins, left with 7 coins

- Stall 2: 7 // 1 = 7 jewels, spend 7 coins, left with 0 coins

- Total jewels: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k=8

In the second example, n=6, k=4, p1=6-4+1=3, p2=1

- Stall 1: 6 // 3 = 2 jewels, spend 6 coins, left with 0 coins

- Stall 2: 0 // 1 = 0 jewels

- Total jewels: 2 + 0 = 2, which is less than k=4, so "NO"

This seems to work for these cases.

But is this approach always correct?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=10, k=5

p1=10-5+1=6, p2=1

- Stall 1: 10 // 6 = 1 jewel, spend 6 coins, left with 4 coins

- Stall 2: 4 // 1 = 4 jewels, spend 4 coins, left with 0 coins

- Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k=5

Another example: n=5, k=2

p1=5-2+1=4, p2=1

- Stall 1: 5 // 4 = 1 jewel, spend 4 coins, left with 1 coin

- Stall 2: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, spend 1 coin, left with 0 coins

- Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k=2

Seems correct.

Another example: n=1, k=1

p1=1-1+1=1, p2=1

- Stall 1: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, spend 1 coin, left with 0 coins

- Stall 2: 0 // 1 = 0 jewels

- Total jewels: 1 + 0 = 1, which matches k=1

Good.

Edge case: n=1, k=1

Already covered.

Another edge case: n=1, k=0

But k is a positive integer, as per the problem statement.

Wait, k is a positive integer, so k >=1.

Another edge case: n=1, k=1

Already covered.

Another case: n=10^18, k=1

p1=10^18 -1 +1 =10^18, p2=1

- Stall 1: 10^18 //10^18 =1 jewel, spend 10^18 coins, left with 0 coins

- Stall 2: 0 //1 =0 jewels

- Total jewels:1 +0=1, which matches k=1

Good.

Another case: n=100, k=10

p1=100-10+1=91, p2=1

- Stall 1:100//91=1 jewel, spend 91 coins, left with9 coins

- Stall 2:9//1=9 jewels, spend9 coins, left with0 coins

- Total jewels:1+9=10, which matches k=10

Seems consistent.

Wait, but in the provided code, it seems like it's printing "YES" and then the number of stalls and their prices only if h >=k, but according to the problem, it should be exactly k.

But in the examples provided, it seems that h exactly matches k in the cases where it's "YES".

In the first example, h=3, k=3

Third example, h=8, k=8

Second example, h=2 <4, so "NO"

So, it seems like it's correct.

But wait, in the code, it's checking if h <k, print "NO", else print "YES" and the prices.

But according to the problem, it should be exactly k, not h >=k.

Wait, but in the simulation, h always equals k in the "YES" cases.

Is there a possibility that h >k?

Let's see.

Suppose n=10, k=3

p1=10-3+1=8, p2=1

- Stall 1:10//8=1 jewel, spend8 coins, left with2 coins

- Stall 2:2//1=2 jewels, spend2 coins, left with0 coins

- Total jewels:1+2=3, which matches k=3

Another case: n=10, k=4

p1=10-4+1=7, p2=1

- Stall 1:10//7=1 jewel, spend7 coins, left with3 coins

- Stall 2:3//1=3 jewels, spend3 coins, left with0 coins

- Total jewels:1+3=4, which matches k=4

Another case: n=10, k=5

p1=10-5+1=6, p2=1

- Stall 1:10//6=1 jewel, spend6 coins, left with4 coins

- Stall 2:4//1=4 jewels, spend4 coins, left with0 coins

- Total jewels:1+4=5, which matches k=5

Seems consistent.

Wait, but what if n=10, k=6

p1=10-6+1=5, p2=1

- Stall 1:10//5=2 jewels, spend10 coins, left with0 coins

- Stall 2:0//1=0 jewels

- Total jewels:2+0=2 <6, so "NO"

Correct.

Another case: n=10, k=2

p1=10-2+1=9, p2=1

- Stall 1:10//9=1 jewel, spend9 coins, left with1 coin

- Stall 2:1//1=1 jewel, spend1 coin, left with0 coins

- Total jewels:1+1=2, which matches k=2

Good.

Seems like this approach works for these cases.

Is there any case where h >k?

Let me think.

Suppose n=10, k=4

As above, h=4

No.

n=10, k=3

h=3

n=10, k=5

h=5

n=10, k=2

h=2

n=10, k=6

h=2 <6, "NO"

Seems like h never exceeds k in these setups.

So, in the code, it's checking if h <k, print "NO", else print "YES".

But according to the simulations, h is either equal to k or less than k, but not greater than k.

So, it seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's think about the general case.

Let me try to generalize.

Given n coins and k jewels to buy.

Set up two stalls: p1 = n - k +1, p2 =1

Then, jewels bought:

- From stall 1: floor(n / p1)

- From stall 2: floor((n - floor(n / p1) * p1) / p2)

Total jewels: floor(n / p1) + floor((n - floor(n / p1) * p1) / p2)

We need this to be equal to k.

Let me denote:

q = floor(n / p1)

r = n - q * p1

Then, total jewels h = q + floor(r / p2)

Given p2 =1, floor(r /1) = r

So, h = q + r

But q = floor(n / p1)

p1 = n - k +1

So, p1 = n - k +1

Then, q = floor(n / (n - k +1))

Similarly, r = n - q * (n - k +1)

We need h = q + r = k

Let me see if this holds.

Let me express r in terms of q:

r = n - q * (n - k +1)

Then, h = q + r = q + n - q * (n - k +1) = n + q * (1 - (n - k +1)) = n + q * (1 - n + k -1) = n + q * (k - n)

Wait, this seems messy.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that h = q + r, and r = n - q * p1

So, h = q + (n - q * p1) = q + n - q * p1 = n + q * (1 - p1)

But p1 = n - k +1

So, h = n + q * (1 - (n - k +1)) = n + q * (1 - n + k -1) = n + q * (k - n)

This still seems complicated.

Maybe I should consider specific values.

Let me take n=10, k=3

p1=10-3+1=8

q=floor(10/8)=1

r=10-1*8=2

h=1+2=3, which matches k=3

Another case: n=10, k=4

p1=10-4+1=7

q=floor(10/7)=1

r=10-1*7=3

h=1+3=4, which matches k=4

Another case: n=10, k=5

p1=10-5+1=6

q=floor(10/6)=1

r=10-1*6=4

h=1+4=5, which matches k=5

Another case: n=10, k=2

p1=10-2+1=9

q=floor(10/9)=1

r=10-1*9=1

h=1+1=2, which matches k=2

Another case: n=10, k=6

p1=10-6+1=5

q=floor(10/5)=2

r=10-2*5=0

h=2+0=2 <6, which is less than k, so "NO"

Seems like when h <k, it's "NO", and when h >=k, it's "YES", but in practice, h never exceeds k in these setups.

Wait, in all the cases where h >=k, h actually equals k.

So, perhaps h cannot be greater than k with this setup.

Hence, the condition h <k implies "NO", and h >=k implies "YES", but since h cannot be greater than k, it's effectively h ==k when h >=k.

Therefore, the approach seems correct.

But to be absolutely sure, let's think about the general case.

Given p1 = n - k +1, p2 =1

Then, q = floor(n / p1)

r = n - q * p1

h = q + r

We need h ==k

Let me see if h ==k always holds when h >=k.

From the earlier cases, it seems to hold.

But perhaps there are cases where h >k.

Let me try to find such a case.

Suppose n=100, k=10

p1=100-10+1=91

q=floor(100/91)=1

r=100-1*91=9

h=1+9=10, which matches k=10

Another case: n=100, k=11

p1=100-11+1=90

q=floor(100/90)=1

r=100-1*90=10

h=1+10=11, which matches k=11

Another case: n=100, k=50

p1=100-50+1=51

q=floor(100/51)=1

r=100-1*51=49

h=1+49=50, which matches k=50

Seems consistent.

Another case: n=100, k=100

p1=100-100+1=1

q=floor(100/1)=100

r=100-100*1=0

h=100+0=100, which matches k=100

Edge case: n=1, k=1

p1=1-1+1=1

q=floor(1/1)=1

r=1-1*1=0

h=1+0=1, which matches k=1

Another edge case: n=2, k=1

p1=2-1+1=2

q=floor(2/2)=1

r=2-1*2=0

h=1+0=1, which matches k=1

Another case: n=2, k=2

p1=2-2+1=1

q=floor(2/1)=2

r=2-2*1=0

h=2+0=2, which matches k=2

Seems like in all these cases, h ==k when h >=k.

Hence, the approach is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
