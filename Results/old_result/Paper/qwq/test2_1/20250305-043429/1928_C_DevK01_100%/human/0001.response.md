Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and getting assigned positions based on some parameter k. The way the positions are assigned is a bit tricky. It says that the first k people get numbers 1 through k, and then the next k-2 people get numbers k-1 down to 2, and this pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.

I need to help Vasya figure out how many natural numbers k (greater than 1) fit the constraints based on his position n and the number x he received during the settling.

First, I need to understand the pattern of how numbers are assigned. Let's look at the example in the problem:

For k=2:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Numbers:   1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2

For k=3:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Numbers:   1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2

For k=5:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Numbers:   1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 2

For k=6:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Numbers:   1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2

From these examples, I can see that for each k, the pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions. So, for k=3, the pattern is 1,2,3,2 and repeats every 4 positions.

My task is, given n (Vasya's position) and x (the number he received), to find how many k's satisfy the condition that at position n, the number assigned is x.

Constraints:

- k > 1

- 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9

- t (number of test cases) is up to 100

Given the large constraints, especially n up to 10^9, I need an efficient way to compute the answer for each test case.

Let me try to find a mathematical relationship between n, x, and k.

First, observe the pattern:

- For k=2: the sequence is 1,2,1,2,...

- For k=3: 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,...

- For k=5: 1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,...

- For k=6: 1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,...

I notice that each cycle has a length of 2k-2.

Within each cycle:

- The first k positions are 1 to k.

- The next k-2 positions are k-1 down to 2.

So, positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k.

Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 down to 2.

And this repeats.

Given that, I need to find all k >1 such that at position n, the number assigned is x.

First, I need to find the position n within its cycle.

Let cycle_length = 2k -2

Then, the cycle that n falls into is floor((n-1)/(cycle_length))

And the position within the cycle is (n-1) % cycle_length +1

Wait, actually, positions are 1-based, so:

cycle_length = 2k -2

cycle_num = floor((n-1)/(cycle_length))

position_in_cycle = n - cycle_num * cycle_length

Then, within the cycle, positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 down to 2

So, if position_in_cycle <= k:

number = position_in_cycle

else:

number = 2k - position_in_cycle

So, number = position_in_cycle if position_in_cycle <=k else 2k - position_in_cycle

Given that at position n, the number is x, so:

x = position_in_cycle if position_in_cycle <=k else 2k - position_in_cycle

I need to solve for k.

So, x = position_in_cycle if position_in_cycle <=k else 2k - position_in_cycle

Let me denote p = position_in_cycle = n - cycle_num * (2k -2)

But cycle_num is floor((n-1)/(2k-2))

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the sequence repeats every 2k-2 positions.

So, for any n, the number assigned depends only on its position within its cycle.

So, let's compute n_mod = n mod (2k -2)

If n_mod <= k, then number = n_mod

Else, number = 2k - n_mod

But n_mod could be 0, which corresponds to the last position in the cycle.

Wait, in Python, modulo operation with positive numbers is fine, but in general, when dealing with positions, it's better to handle it carefully.

Let me make sure.

Given n, cycle_length = 2k -2

Compute n_mod = n mod cycle_length

If n_mod <= k, number = n_mod

Else, number = 2k - n_mod

But n_mod could be 0, which means n is exactly at the end of a cycle.

In that case, n_mod = cycle_length

So, n_mod = n mod cycle_length

If n_mod == 0, then n_mod = cycle_length

Then, if n_mod <= k, number = n_mod

Else, number = 2k - n_mod

But I need to make sure that this correctly maps to the intended number.

Given that, I need to find k such that the above equation holds for given n and x.

So, x = n_mod if n_mod <=k else 2k - n_mod

I need to solve for k.

Let me consider two cases:

1. n_mod <= k: x = n_mod

2. n_mod > k: x = 2k - n_mod

In the first case, x = n_mod <= k

So, k >= x

In the second case, x = 2k - n_mod, with n_mod > k

So, x = 2k - n_mod, and n_mod > k

From x = 2k - n_mod, we can write n_mod = 2k - x

But since n_mod > k, we have 2k - x > k => k > x

So, in this case, k > x

Wait, but x < n, and n can be up to 1e9, so x can be up to 1e9 -1

But k can be from 2 to some value less than or equal to n.

Wait, but in the second case, k > x, but x < n, so k can be up to n.

But I need to find all k >1 that satisfy either:

- n_mod <= k and x = n_mod

- n_mod > k and x = 2k - n_mod

Given that cycle_length = 2k -2, and n_mod = n mod cycle_length

If n_mod =0, n_mod = cycle_length

So, n_mod can be from 1 to 2k-2

Let me consider the first case: n_mod <=k and x = n_mod

So, n_mod = x, and x <=k

Also, n_mod = n mod cycle_length, and if n_mod =0, n_mod = cycle_length

So, n mod cycle_length is either x or cycle_length

So, n mod (2k -2) is x or (2k -2)

But 2k -2 = cycle_length

So, n mod (2k -2) is either x or (2k -2)

If n mod (2k -2) =x, and x <=k

Then, x = n_mod <=k

So, one possibility is n mod (2k -2) =x and x <=k

Similarly, if n mod (2k -2) =2k -2, then n_mod =2k -2

But in this case, if 2k -2 <=k, which implies k <=2

But for k >1, when k=2, 2k -2=2, which is <=k=2

Wait, for k >=3, 2k -2 >k

So, for k >=3, 2k -2 >k

But for k=2, 2k -2=2=k

For k=1, 2k -2=0, but k>1

So, for k >=2, 2k -2 >=k

Wait, for k=2, 2k -2=2=k

For k=3, 2k -2=4>k=3

For k=4, 2k -2=6>k=4, etc.

So, in general, for k >=2, 2k -2 >=k

Therefore, n_mod can be x or 2k -2

But in the second case, when n_mod >k, x=2k -n_mod

So, x=2k -n_mod, and n_mod >k

But n_mod <=2k -2

So, 2k -n_mod <k

Wait, but x=2k -n_mod, and n_mod >k, so x <k

But x <k, but in this case, x=2k -n_mod, and n_mod=2k -x

But since n_mod >k, then 2k -x >k => k >x

So, k >x

Therefore, in this case, k >x

In the first case, x <=k

So, overall, k >=x in the first case, and k >x in the second case

But I need to consider both cases.

Wait, but in the problem, x <n

So, k can be from 2 to n-1, since k >1 and k <=n-1 (since x <n)

Wait, actually, k can be up to n, but since x <n, and in the second case, k >x, so k can be up to n

But n can be up to 1e9, so I need an efficient way to find all k that satisfy the conditions.

Let me try to formalize the conditions.

Given n and x, find all integers k >1 such that:

Either:

1. n mod (2k -2) =x and x <=k

Or

2. n mod (2k -2) =2k -2 and x=2k -(2k -2)=2

Wait, in the second case, if n_mod=2k -2, then x=2k -(2k -2)=2

So, in this case, x=2

But in the problem, x can be up to n-1, which can be up to 1e9 -1

So, this seems too restrictive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me re-examine the second case.

Given that n_mod=2k -2, and x=2k -n_mod=2k -(2k -2)=2

So, x=2

But in the problem, x can be any value from 1 to n-1

So, in the second case, x is always 2, which is a special case.

Therefore, for x !=2, only the first case applies, where n mod (2k -2)=x and x <=k

For x=2, there's an additional possibility where n mod (2k -2)=2k -2 and x=2

So, for x !=2:

- Find all k >1 such that n mod (2k -2)=x and x <=k

For x=2:

- Find all k >1 such that n mod (2k -2)=x and x <=k

- Plus all k >2 such that n mod (2k -2)=2k -2 and x=2

Wait, but in the second case for x=2, n mod (2k -2)=2k -2, which implies n is a multiple of (2k -2)

Because n mod (2k -2)=2k -2 => n=(m*(2k -2)) + (2k -2) => n=(m+1)*(2k -2)

So, n is a multiple of (2k -2)

And x=2

So, for x=2, there are two possibilities:

1. n mod (2k -2)=x=2 and 2 <=k

2. n is a multiple of (2k -2) and x=2

But in the first case, n mod (2k -2)=2 and 2 <=k

So, for x=2, it's a bit special.

But in general, for x !=2, only the first case applies.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle x=2 separately.

But maybe there's a better way to generalize this.

Let me consider the general condition:

x = n_mod if n_mod <=k else 2k -n_mod

And n_mod = n mod (2k -2)

So, x = n_mod if n_mod <=k else 2k -n_mod

I need to solve for k.

Let me consider that n_mod = n mod (2k -2)

So, n_mod can be from 1 to 2k -2

But in the pattern, for positions 1 to k, number = position

For positions k+1 to 2k -2, number = 2k - position

So, for a given n and x, I need to find k such that:

If position_in_cycle <=k, then x=position_in_cycle

Else, x=2k -position_in_cycle

Where position_in_cycle = n_mod

So, x = position_in_cycle if position_in_cycle <=k else 2k -position_in_cycle

Therefore, x = position_in_cycle when position_in_cycle <=k

Or x = 2k - position_in_cycle when position_in_cycle >k

So, to find k, I need to consider both possibilities.

But this seems a bit convoluted.

Maybe I can rearrange the equations to solve for k.

Case 1: position_in_cycle <=k

Then, x = position_in_cycle

So, position_in_cycle =x

Therefore, n mod (2k -2) =x

And x <=k

So, k >=x

Case 2: position_in_cycle >k

Then, x = 2k - position_in_cycle

So, position_in_cycle = 2k -x

But position_in_cycle >k, so 2k -x >k => k >x

Also, position_in_cycle <=2k -2, so 2k -x <=2k -2 => -x <= -2 => x >=2

Wait, x >=2

So, for case 2 to be possible, x >=2

Therefore, for x >=2, there's an additional case where k >x and n mod (2k -2) =2k -x

Wait, position_in_cycle =2k -x

And n mod (2k -2) =2k -x

So, n mod (2k -2) =2k -x

And k >x

So, for x >=2, there are two possibilities:

1. n mod (2k -2) =x and x <=k

2. n mod (2k -2) =2k -x and k >x

For x=1, only the first case applies, since in the second case, x >=2

For x=2, both cases apply.

So, in general, for any x, the possible k's are those that satisfy:

- Either n mod (2k -2) =x and x <=k

- Or (for x >=2) n mod (2k -2) =2k -x and k >x

But I need to find all such k's efficiently, given that n can be up to 1e9.

I need to find all integers k >1 that satisfy one of these conditions.

Let me try to rearrange the equations to solve for k.

First case: n mod (2k -2) =x and x <=k

So, n ≡ x mod (2k -2)

Which means n -x is divisible by (2k -2)

So, n -x = m*(2k -2) for some integer m >=0

Then, n -x = m*(2k -2)

Solve for k:

n -x = m*(2k -2)

n -x = 2m*k - 2m

2m*k = n -x + 2m

k = (n -x + 2m)/(2m)

But this seems messy.

Alternatively, let’s denote c = 2k -2

Then, n ≡ x mod c

And x <= (c +2)/2

Wait, c =2k -2 => k=(c +2)/2

So, x <= (c +2)/2

So, x <= (c +2)/2

Which is x <= (2k -2 +2)/2 = k

So, x <=k

Similarly, in the second case, x=2k - position_in_cycle, with position_in_cycle >k

position_in_cycle =2k -x >k => 2k -x >k => k >x

So, k >x

Therefore, for each c=2k -2, which is c=2k -2, k=(c +2)/2

So, for each possible c, which must be even since k is integer.

Wait, k must be integer, so c must be even.

Wait, k can be any integer >1.

Given that, c=2k -2, which for k=2, c=2; k=3, c=4; k=4, c=6, etc.

So, c is even and >=2.

So, for each even c >=2, k=(c +2)/2

Now, n ≡x mod c

And, for the first case, x <=k=(c +2)/2

For the second case, x=2k -(c)=2*(c +2)/2 - c = c +2 -c =2

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, in the second case, x=2k - position_in_cycle, and position_in_cycle=2k -x

But position_in_cycle = n mod c

So, n mod c =2k -x

But 2k=c +2

So, n mod c =c +2 -x

But c +2 -x ≡ c +2 -x -c =2 -x mod c

Wait, this seems confusing.

Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Let’s consider that c=2k -2, and k=(c +2)/2

Then, for the first case, n mod c =x and x <=k=(c +2)/2

For the second case, n mod c =c and x=2

Wait, in the second case, n mod c =c, which is equivalent to n mod c=0

But in the earlier analysis, when n mod c =c, position_in_cycle=c, which corresponds to x=2

So, for x=2, there's an additional case where n is a multiple of c.

Therefore, for x=2, there are two possibilities:

1. n mod c =x=2 and x <=k=(c +2)/2

2. n mod c =0 and x=2

For x !=2, only the first case applies.

So, to generalize, for any x, find c such that:

- n ≡x mod c

- x <= (c +2)/2

And for x=2, also consider:

- n ≡0 mod c

Wait, but c=2k -2, and k=(c +2)/2

So, c must be even, since k is integer.

Therefore, c is even, c >=2

So, for x !=2:

Find even c >=2 such that:

n ≡x mod c

And x <= (c +2)/2

For x=2:

Also include c such that n ≡0 mod c

And k=(c +2)/2 >x=2, so c >=2

Wait, k=(c +2)/2 >2 => c +2 >4 => c >2 => c >=4

So, for x=2, the second case includes c >=4 where n ≡0 mod c

So, overall:

For x !=2:

Find even c >=2 such that n ≡x mod c and x <= (c +2)/2

For x=2:

- Find even c >=2 such that n ≡2 mod c and 2 <= (c +2)/2

- Plus find even c >=4 such that n ≡0 mod c

Now, (c +2)/2 >=2 when c >=2, which it is.

So, for x=2, the first part is same as x !=2 case, plus additional c >=4 where n ≡0 mod c

Now, c=2k -2, and k=(c +2)/2

So, to find k, I need to find all even c >=2 that satisfy the above conditions, then k=(c +2)/2

So, the problem reduces to finding all even divisors c of (n -x) such that c >=x and c >=2*(x <=k)

Wait, that seems unclear.

Let me think differently.

Given that n ≡x mod c, which means c divides n -x

So, c divides n -x

Similarly, for the second case when x=2, n ≡0 mod c, which means c divides n

So, for x !=2:

Find even c >=2 such that c divides n -x and x <= (c +2)/2

For x=2:

- Find even c >=2 such that c divides n -2 and 2 <= (c +2)/2

- Plus find even c >=4 such that c divides n and x=2

But (c +2)/2 >=2 when c >=2, which is always true for c >=2

So, for x=2, it's just:

- Find even c >=2 such that c divides n -2

- Plus find even c >=4 such that c divides n

Then, k=(c +2)/2 for each such c

Now, I need to find all even c >=2 that divide n -x for x !=2, and for x=2, also include c >=4 that divide n

Then, k=(c +2)/2

But c must be even, so c +2 is even, and k is integer.

So, the task is to find all even divisors c of (n -x) for x !=2, and for x=2, also consider even divisors c >=4 of n

Then, k=(c +2)/2

But I need to make sure that k >1

Which, since c >=2, k >=2

So, k >1 is satisfied.

Now, to implement this efficiently, given that n and x can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to find all even divisors of (n -x) and n.

But finding all divisors of a number up to 1e9 is feasible if done efficiently, as the number of divisors is small (up to around 100 for numbers up to 1e9).

So, here's a plan:

- For each test case:

- Read n and x

- If x ==2:

- Find all even c >=2 that divide n -2

- Find all even c >=4 that divide n

- For each c, compute k=(c +2)/2

- Ensure k >1, which is already satisfied

- For x !=2:

- Find all even c >=2 that divide n -x

- Compute k=(c +2)/2 for each such c

- Output the number of such k's

But wait, in the code provided, there's a function func_1(q, x) that seems to be finding some values based on q and x.

Let me look at the provided code:

import math

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

L = list(map(int, input().split()))

n = L[0]

x = L[1]

ans = 0

y = n + x

if y % 2 !=0:

print(0)

continue

else:

L1 = func_1((y -2)//2, x)

if n >=3*x -2:

L1 += func_1((n -x)//2, x)

L1 = list(set(L1))

print(len(L1))

continue

def func_1(q, x):

M = []

w = math.sqrt(q)

if w == w //1 and w >=x -1:

M += [w]

i =1

while i <w:

if q %i ==0:

if i >=x -1:

M += [i]

if q //i >=x -1:

M += [q //i]

i +=1

return M

So, the code is doing the following:

- Read t test cases

- For each test case, read n and x

- Compute y = n +x

- If y is odd, output 0

- Else, compute q = (y -2)//2

- Call func_1(q, x) and store the result in L1

- If n >=3*x -2, compute q2=(n -x)//2 and call func_1(q2, x), append the result to L1

- Remove duplicates from L1 and print the length

Now, func_1(q, x) seems to find divisors of q that are >=x-1

It also includes the square root of q if it's an integer and >=x-1

Then, it iterates from 1 to sqrt(q), inclusive, and adds divisors i and q//i if they are >=x-1

So, it's collecting divisors of q that are >=x-1

But I need to understand how this relates to the problem.

Let me try to relate this to my earlier analysis.

Recall that c divides n -x for x !=2, and c divides n for x=2 in the second case.

But in the code, it's computing y =n +x, and q=(y -2)//2

Let me see what y =n +x represents.

Wait, y =n +x

Then, y -2 =n +x -2

q=(y -2)//2=(n +x -2)//2

Similarly, in the second part, q2=(n -x)//2

I need to see how these relate to c or k.

Wait, let's see:

c=2k -2

So, k=(c +2)/2

So, perhaps q is related to c or k.

Wait, let's see:

From c=2k -2, then c +2=2k

So, k=(c +2)/2

Now, let's see what q=(n +x -2)//2 represents.

I need to find a relationship between q and c or k.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is finding q such that q=(n +x -2)//2, and then finding divisors of q that are >=x-1.

Then, k is related to these divisors.

Wait, perhaps in the code, they are considering q=(n +x -2)//2, and then finding divisors of q that are >=x-1, and mapping them to k.

Similarly, for the second part, q2=(n -x)//2, and finding divisors of q2 that are >=x-1.

Then, combining these and removing duplicates to get the list of possible k's.

But I need to verify if this is correct.

Let me consider the first test case:

n=10, x=2

Compute y=10+2=12, which is even

q=(12 -2)//2=10//2=5

Then, func_1(5,2)

So, q=5, x=2

w=sqrt(5)=2.236, which is not integer, so M=[]

Then, i from 1 to 2

i=1, 5%1==0, 1 >=1, so M+=[1], 5//1=5 >=1, so M+=[5], M=[1,5]

i=2, 5%2=1 !=0, skip

So, M=[1,5]

Now, check if n >=3*x -2 =>10 >=6 -2 =>10 >=4, which is true

So, q2=(10 -2)//2=8//2=4

func_1(4,2)

q=4, x=2

w=sqrt(4)=2.0, which is integer and >=1, so M+=[2]

Then, i=1, 4%1==0, 1 >=1, so M+=[1], 4//1=4 >=1, so M+=[4]

i=2, 4%2==0, 2 >=1, so M+=[2], 4//2=2 >=1, so M+=[2]

So, M=[1,5,1,4,2,2]

Remove duplicates, so [1,5,4,2]

Then, k=(c +2)/2, where c is even >=2

But c=2k -2 => k=(c +2)/2

So, for c=1, k=1.5, which is not integer, so invalid

For c=5, k=3.5, invalid

For c=4, k=3

For c=2, k=2

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, c must be even >=2

But in func_1, it's including odd c's as well, which would give non-integer k

So, perhaps the code is incorrect in including odd c's

Wait, but in the first func_1 call, M=[1,5], and in the second, M=[1,5,1,4,2,2], combined and unique are [1,5,4,2]

But only c=2 and c=4 are even, which give k=2 and k=3, which are valid

But according to the example, k=2,3,5,6 are valid

Wait, but c=2k -2, so for k=2, c=2; k=3, c=4; k=5, c=8; k=6, c=10

So, in the first func_1 call with q=5, it gives c=5 (invalid, since c must be even), c=1 (invalid), c=4 (valid, k=3), c=2 (valid, k=2)

Wait, but c=5 is invalid, so only c=2 and c=4 are valid, giving k=2 and k=3

But according to the example, k=2,3,5,6 are valid

Wait, for k=5, c=8, which should be included

But in the second func_1 call with q=4, M=[1,4,2]

But c=8 is not in M, so perhaps there's an error.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how q relates to c.

Let me try to find a relationship between q and c.

From q=(n +x -2)//2

And c=2k -2

Let me see if q is related to c in some way.

Wait, perhaps q is related to c via some equation.

Alternatively, perhaps q=c/2

Wait, c=2k -2 => c/2 =k -1 => k=c/2 +1

But q=(n +x -2)//2

I need to see if there's a direct relationship between q and c.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is finding divisors of q, and using them to compute possible c's.

But it's not clear to me yet.

Let me look at the second func_1 call with q2=(n -x)//2=(10 -2)//2=4

So, func_1(4,2)

Which gives M=[1,4,2]

But c=8 is not directly obtained from here.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Looking back at the example, for n=10, x=2, k=2,3,5,6 are valid.

But according to the code, it only finds k=2 and k=3 from the first func_1 call, and possibly k=3 and k=5 from the second func_1 call, but it's not clear.

Wait, perhaps I need to map c to k correctly.

Given that c=2k -2, then k=(c +2)/2

So, for c=2, k=2

c=4, k=3

c=8, k=5

c=10, k=6

So, in the first func_1 call with q=5, it returns [1,5]

Then, k=(1+2)/2=1.5 (invalid), and k=(5+2)/2=3.5 (invalid)

Wait, but in the earlier step, it had M=[1,5,1,4,2,2]

Wait, no, in the first func_1 call with q=5, M=[1,5]

In the second func_1 call with q2=4, M=[1,4,2]

Then, combined unique M=[1,5,4,2]

Then, k=(1+2)/2=1.5 (invalid), k=(5+2)/2=3.5 (invalid), k=(4+2)/2=3, k=(2+2)/2=2

So, only k=3 and k=2 are considered valid

But according to the example, k=5 and k=6 are also valid

So, perhaps the code is incorrect

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back, the code computes L1=func_1((y -2)//2, x)

Then, if n >=3*x -2, L1 += func_1((n -x)//2, x)

Then, it takes the set of L1 and prints its length

In the first func_1 call, q=(y -2)//2=(n +x -2)//2

In the second func_1 call, q2=(n -x)//2

Then, func_1(q, x) finds divisors of q that are >=x-1

Similarly for q2

Then, c is set to these divisors

But c should be even, but the code doesn't enforce that

So, perhaps the code is incorrect in including odd c's

Wait, but in the example, k=5 and k=6 are valid, which correspond to c=8 and c=10

Which are even, so they should be included

But according to the code, for q=5, it includes c=5 (invalid, since it's odd), and c=1 (invalid)

For q2=4, it includes c=4 and c=2 (both even, valid)

So, perhaps the code needs to filter only even c's

But it doesn't do that

So, perhaps it's a mistake

Wait, in the code, it seems to be including odd c's, which would lead to non-integer k's

So, perhaps the code is incorrect in that aspect

Alternatively, maybe there's a different relationship.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that c divides n -x for x !=2, and c divides n for x=2 in the second case

But in the code, it's computing q=(n +x -2)//2, and finding divisors of q

I need to see how q relates to c

Wait, perhaps q=c/2

Then, c=2q

Given that c=2k -2, so 2q=2k -2 => q=k -1 => k=q +1

So, k=q +1

But q=(n +x -2)//2

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent

Wait, if q=c/2, and c=2k -2, then q=k -1

So, k=q +1

But q=(n +x -2)//2

So, k=(n +x -2)//2 +1

But this seems too direct, and doesn't match the example

Wait, in the example, n=10, x=2

q=(10 +2 -2)//2=10//2=5

Then, k=5 +1=6, which is one of the valid k's

Similarly, for q=4, k=4 +1=5, which is also valid

But according to the code, it considers q=5 and q=4, leading to k=6 and k=5

But in the earlier step, it had c=2 and c=4 from the divisors, leading to k=2 and k=3

This is confusing

Perhaps I need to look at the problem differently.

Let me consider that c divides n -x, so c is a divisor of n -x

Given that c=2k -2, which is even, so c must be even

Therefore, I need to find all even c's that divide n -x, and satisfy x <=k=(c +2)/2

Similarly, for x=2, also consider c's that divide n and c >=4

So, in the code, it seems to be finding divisors of q=(n +x -2)//2, but I'm not sure why

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code

Let me consider that c divides n -x, so c divides n -x

Then, c divides n -x => n -x = m*c for some integer m >=1

Similarly, c=2k -2

So, n -x = m*(2k -2)

But k=(c +2)/2, so n -x = m*(c)

Therefore, c divides n -x

So, c is a divisor of n -x

Similarly, for x=2, there's an additional case where c divides n and c >=4

So, to find all even c's that divide n -x for x !=2, and for x=2, also include even c's >=4 that divide n

Then, k=(c +2)/2

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to find all even divisors of n -x for x !=2, and for x=2, all even divisors of n that are >=4

Then, compute k=(c +2)/2 for each such c

But in the code, it's computing q=(n +x -2)//2, and finding divisors of q

Similarly, q2=(n -x)//2

I need to see how q relates to c

Wait, if q=(n -x)/c, then perhaps q*c =n -x

But I'm not sure

Wait, perhaps q=c/2, so c=2q

Then, c=2q divides n -x => 2q divides n -x => q divides (n -x)/2

But this is getting too convoluted

Alternatively, perhaps q=(n -x)/c

Then, c=(n -x)/q

But I'm not sure

Let me try to think differently

Suppose c=2k -2

Then, c=2(k -1)

So, c is even, and c >=2 for k >=2

Now, c divides n -x

So, n -x is divisible by c

Therefore, n -x = m*c for some integer m >=1

But c=2(k -1), so n -x = m*2(k -1)

So, n -x = 2m(k -1)

Similarly, for x=2, there's an additional case where c divides n and c >=4

So, for x !=2:

Find even c >=2 that divide n -x, and x <=k=(c +2)/2

For x=2:

- Find even c >=2 that divide n -2

- Plus find even c >=4 that divide n

Then, k=(c +2)/2 for each such c

Now, to implement this, I need to find all even divisors of n -x for x !=2, and for x=2, all even divisors of n -2 and n with c >=4

But in the code, it's computing q=(n +x -2)//2, and finding divisors of q

This seems inconsistent with my analysis

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis

Let me try to see if there's a relationship between n -x and n +x

Wait, n -x = m*c

n +x = m*c +2x -2x = m*c +2x -2x

Wait, not helpful

Alternatively, perhaps the code is considering c divides n -x and c divides n +x -2

Wait, if c divides n -x and c divides n +x -2, then c divides their sum and difference

Sum: (n -x) + (n +x -2) = 2n -2

Difference: (n +x -2) - (n -x) = 2x -2

So, c divides 2n -2 and c divides 2x -2

But c=2k -2, which is even, so c divides 2n -2 and 2x -2

But this seems too vague

Alternatively, perhaps the code is considering c divides y
