Alright, I have this problem to solve. I need to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. The program is supposed to construct a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even and k â‰¤ n. The definition of a k-level permutation is that among all the sums of continuous segments of length k, any two sums differ by no more than 1.

First, I need to make sure I understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation of length 5.

Now, the task is to create a permutation where the sums of all consecutive segments of length k differ by at most 1. This sounds tricky, but the problem assures me that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Looking at the program, it seems there are two functions: func_1 and func_2. The main function calls func_2, which in turn calls func_1 for each test case. The variable t represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, func_1 is called.

In func_1, the inputs n and k are read, and a permutation of length n is constructed. The permutation is built by iterating from 0 to k-1, and for each i in this range, it calculates multiples of k plus i and assigns consecutive values starting from 1 to these positions in the permutation array.

Let me try to understand this construction. It seems like it's distributing the numbers from 1 to n into the permutation array in a specific order based on the value of k.

Let's take an example from the problem:

Input:

5

2 2

3 2

10 4

13 4

7 4

Output:

2 1

1 3 2

1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6

4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7

1 6 3 7 2 5 4

Looking at the first test case, n=2, k=2:

Permutation: 2 1

Sum of the only segment of length 2: 2 + 1 = 3

So, there's only one sum, which trivially satisfies the condition.

Second test case, n=3, k=2:

Permutation: 1 3 2

Sums:

1 + 3 = 4

3 + 2 = 5

Maximum sum is 5, minimum is 4, difference is 1, which satisfies the condition.

Third test case, n=10, k=4:

Permutation: 1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6

Sums:

1+8+4+10 = 23

8+4+10+2 = 24

4+10+2+7 = 23

10+2+7+5 = 24

2+7+5+9 = 23

7+5+9+3 = 24

5+9+3+6 = 23

Maximum sum is 24, minimum is 23, difference is 1.

This seems correct.

Fourth test case, n=13, k=4:

Permutation: 4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7

Sums:

4+10+1+13 = 28

10+1+13+5 = 29

1+13+5+9 = 28

13+5+9+2 = 29

5+9+2+12 = 28

9+2+12+6 = 29

2+12+6+8 = 28

12+6+8+3 = 29

6+8+3+11 = 28

8+3+11+7 = 29

Maximum sum is 29, minimum is 28, difference is 1.

Again, correct.

Fifth test case, n=7, k=4:

Permutation: 1 6 3 7 2 5 4

Sums:

1+6+3+7 = 17

6+3+7+2 = 18

3+7+2+5 = 17

7+2+5+4 = 18

Maximum sum is 18, minimum is 17, difference is 1.

All test cases seem to satisfy the condition.

Now, looking back at the program, func_1 seems to be constructing the permutation based on some logic involving multiples of k plus i.

Let me try to understand this logic.

In func_1:

permutation = [0] * n

idx = 0

idx_v = 1

curr_v = 1

for i in range(k):

multiples_of_k_plus_i = i

while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):

permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v

curr_v += 1

multiples_of_k_plus_i += k

So, for each i from 0 to k-1, it's setting permutation[i + j*k] = curr_v, where j starts from 0 and increments until i + j*k >= n.

This seems like it's filling the permutation array in a strided manner, with stride k.

For example, take n=10, k=4:

i=0: positions 0,4,8: 1,5,9

i=1: positions 1,5,9: 2,6,10

i=2: positions 2,6: 3,7

i=3: positions 3,7: 4,8

Wait, but in the example output, the permutation is 1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6.

But according to this logic, it should be 1 at position 0, 2 at position 1, 3 at position 2, 4 at position 3, 5 at position 4, 6 at position 5, 7 at position 6, 8 at position 7, 9 at position 8, 10 at position 9.

But that would be: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

But in the example, it's 1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6.

This doesn't match the simple stride filling.

So maybe my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, in the code, it's setting permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v, where multiples_of_k_plus_i starts from i and increments by k each time.

So for n=10, k=4:

i=0: positions 0,4,8: assigned 1,2,3

Wait, curr_v starts at 1 and increments each time.

So:

i=0:

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 0

permutation[0] = 1

curr_v = 2

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 4

permutation[4] = 2

curr_v = 3

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 8

permutation[8] = 3

curr_v = 4

i=1:

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 1

permutation[1] = 4

curr_v = 5

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 5

permutation[5] = 5

curr_v = 6

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 9

permutation[9] = 6

curr_v = 7

i=2:

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 2

permutation[2] = 7

curr_v = 8

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 6

permutation[6] = 8

curr_v = 9

i=3:

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 3

permutation[3] = 9

curr_v = 10

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 7

permutation[7] = 10

curr_v = 11

So the permutation would be: 1,4,7,9,2,5,8,10,3,6

But in the example, it's 1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6.

These don't match. So either the code is different from what's provided, or there's a mistake in the example.

Wait, perhaps the code is different. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, in the problem, the output for n=10, k=4 is 1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6.

But according to the code's logic, it should be 1,4,7,9,2,5,8,10,3,6.

So there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe the code provided is not the same as what was used to generate the example output.

This could be a problem. Maybe the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there are multiple correct permutations, and the example shows one while the code generates another.

But in any case, I need to verify if the code's generated permutation satisfies the condition.

Let's take n=10, k=4.

According to the code's logic, the permutation should be 1,4,7,9,2,5,8,10,3,6.

Now, let's compute the sums of consecutive segments of length 4:

1+4+7+9 = 21

4+7+9+2 = 22

7+9+2+5 = 23

9+2+5+8 = 24

2+5+8+10 = 25

5+8+10+3 = 26

8+10+3+6 = 27

10+3+6+0 = ? Wait, n=10, so last segment is 8+10+3+6 = 27.

Wait, n=10, k=4, so n - k +1 = 7 segments.

Wait, no, n=10, k=4: 10-4+1=7 segments.

But in the earlier example, there were 7 sums: 23,24,23,24,23,24,23.

But according to the code's permutation, the sums are 21,22,23,24,25,26,27.

The difference between max and min is 27-21=6, which is greater than 1.

This violates the condition.

So, the code's permutation does not satisfy the condition.

But in the example, the permutation is 1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6, and their sums are 23,24,23,24,23,24,23, which satisfies the condition.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it generates a different permutation that doesn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, but perhaps the code is different from what's provided.

Looking back, perhaps the code provided is incomplete or incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the code.

Wait, let's check the code again.

In func_1:

permutation = [0] * n

idx = 0

idx_v = 1

curr_v = 1

for i in range(k):

multiples_of_k_plus_i = i

while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):

permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v

curr_v += 1

multiples_of_k_plus_i += k

So, it's filling the permutation array by stepping through the array in steps of k, starting from i.

This seems like it's filling the array in a strided order.

But in the example, the permutation is 1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6, which doesn't match the pattern I thought.

Wait, maybe the code is different from what's provided.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the code provided is incorrect, and I need to find a correct approach.

Given that the code's permutation doesn't satisfy the condition, I need to find a correct way to generate a k-level permutation.

Let me think about how to construct such a permutation.

Given that k is even, perhaps there's a way to arrange the numbers so that the sums of any k consecutive elements differ by at most 1.

One approach could be to arrange the numbers in a way that the differences in sums are minimized.

Perhaps arranging the numbers in a specific order, like alternating high and low numbers.

Wait, let's consider the example for n=10, k=4:

Permutation: 1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6

Sums:

1+8+4+10=23

8+4+10+2=24

4+10+2+7=23

10+2+7+5=24

2+7+5+9=23

7+5+9+3=24

5+9+3+6=23

So, sums alternate between 23 and 24.

This suggests that the permutation is constructed in a way that the sums alternate by 1.

How can I achieve this in general?

Perhaps by arranging the numbers in a specific pattern where high and low numbers are placed in a way that the sums of k consecutive numbers differ by at most 1.

Another idea is to use a specific ordering based on the value of k being even.

Given that k is even, perhaps I can pair high and low numbers in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps I can interleave two sequences: one ascending and one descending.

For example, for n=10, k=4:

Ascending: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Descending: 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1

Interleave them in a specific way to achieve the desired property.

But I need a more systematic approach.

Let me consider the sum of any k consecutive elements.

To make the sums differ by at most 1, the differences between overlapping sums should be controlled.

When moving the window by one position, the sum changes by subtracting the element that's no longer in the window and adding the new element.

So, the difference in sums is equal to the new element minus the old element.

To keep the difference between any two sums at most 1, the difference between any two such window sums should be at most 1.

This implies that the difference between any two elements that are k positions apart should be controlled.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the difference between elements that are k positions apart is minimized.

But I need a clearer approach.

Let me consider the total sum s of the permutation.

The average sum of k consecutive elements would be s/k.

To make the sums of any k consecutive elements differ by at most 1, they should be floor(s/k) or ceil(s/k).

But I need to ensure that the difference between any two such sums is at most 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to focus on the differences between consecutive sums.

When shifting the window by one position, the sum changes by p[i+k] - p[i].

To keep the difference between any two sums small, these differences should be controlled.

Given that k is even, perhaps there's a way to pair elements to balance the sums.

Alternatively, perhaps I can arrange the permutation in a way that the sum of every k consecutive elements is as equal as possible.

Given that k is even, maybe there's a specific pattern or formula to generate such a permutation.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to be trying to distribute the numbers in a specific order based on their positions in the permutation array.

But as we saw, it doesn't generate a permutation that satisfies the condition.

Therefore, I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider the following strategy:

1. Start by placing the smallest available number in the first position.

2. For the next position, place a number that helps keep the sum of the first k elements close to the desired average.

3. Continue this process, ensuring that the sums of overlapping k-windows differ by at most 1.

However, this seems too vague and may not lead to an efficient solution, especially considering the constraints (n up to 2e5, sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5).

I need a more efficient and systematic way to construct the permutation.

Wait, perhaps I can use a specific ordering based on the value of k.

Given that k is even, maybe I can arrange the permutation in a way that every k/2 positions, I alternate between high and low numbers.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me divide the permutation into blocks of size k/2.

In each block, I can place the smallest available numbers in the first half and the largest available numbers in the second half, or vice versa, to balance the sums.

Wait, perhaps I can use a specific ordering where I arrange the numbers in increasing order for the first k/2 positions, and then in decreasing order for the next k/2 positions, and repeat this pattern.

Let me try this for n=10, k=4:

k/2 = 2.

So, in each block of 4 positions:

- First 2 positions: increasing order.

- Next 2 positions: decreasing order.

Assign numbers in order: 1,2,4,3,5,6,8,7,9,10.

Let's check the sums:

1+2+4+3=10

2+4+3+5=14

4+3+5+6=18

3+5+6+8=22

5+6+8+7=26

6+8+7+9=30

8+7+9+10=34

The differences are larger than 1.

This doesn't satisfy the condition.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Alternative idea:

Perhaps I need to arrange the numbers in a way that the sum of every k consecutive elements is as equal as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can distribute the high and low numbers evenly across the permutation.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the numbers in a specific sequence where the sum of every k consecutive elements is balanced.

Another idea is to arrange the numbers in a specific pattern that repeats every k positions.

But I need to ensure that the sums of any k consecutive elements differ by at most 1.

This seems challenging.

Let me look back at the example provided:

For n=10, k=4:

Permutation: 1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6

Sums:

1+8+4+10=23

8+4+10+2=24

4+10+2+7=23

10+2+7+5=24

2+7+5+9=23

7+5+9+3=24

5+9+3+6=23

So, sums alternate between 23 and 24.

Looking at this pattern, it seems that the sums oscillate by 1.

How is this achieved?

Looking at the permutation: 1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6

Let's see the pattern:

Position 1: 1 (low)

Position 2: 8 (high)

Position 3: 4 (medium)

Position 4: 10 (high)

Position 5: 2 (low)

Position 6: 7 (high)

Position 7: 5 (medium)

Position 8: 9 (high)

Position 9: 3 (low)

Position 10: 6 (medium)

It seems like there's a pattern of alternating between low, high, medium values.

Perhaps the idea is to arrange the permutation in a way that the sum of every k consecutive elements is either floor(total_sum / (n - k + 1)) or ceil(total_sum / (n - k + 1)).

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that for k being even, perhaps pairing high and low numbers in a specific way can balance the sums.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the permutation in a way that for every k positions, the sum is as balanced as possible.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Divide the numbers from 1 to n into two groups: low half and high half.

- Arrange these numbers in a specific pattern to balance the sums of k consecutive elements.

But I need to think of a general algorithm that works for any n and k (with k even and k <= n).

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a standard algorithm or a known strategy for constructing such permutations.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical property or formula that can be used to generate such permutations efficiently.

Given that k is even, maybe there's a way to pair elements to balance the sums.

Wait, perhaps I can use a specific ordering based on the residue classes modulo k.

Given that k is even, perhaps arranging the numbers in a specific order based on their positions modulo k can help balance the sums.

For example, in the code provided, it's filling the permutation array by stepping through the array in steps of k, starting from i=0 to i=k-1.

But as we saw, this doesn't necessarily generate a permutation that satisfies the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to arrange the permutation in a specific order, such as in a "snake" pattern or some other pattern that balances the sums.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that the provided code is incorrect and look for an alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and I made a mistake in understanding it.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back at func_1:

permutation = [0] * n

idx = 0

idx_v = 1

curr_v = 1

for i in range(k):

multiples_of_k_plus_i = i

while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):

permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v

curr_v += 1

multiples_of_k_plus_i += k

So, it's filling the permutation array by iterating over i from 0 to k-1, and for each i, it sets permutation[i + j*k] = curr_v, where j starts from 0 and increments until i + j*k >= n.

This is similar to arranging the numbers in a specific order based on their positions in the array.

But as I saw earlier, this doesn't generate the permutation shown in the example, which does satisfy the condition.

Therefore, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the code.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct, and I miscalculated the permutation it generates.

Let me try again with n=10, k=4.

Initialize permutation = [0]*10

i=0:

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 0

permutation[0] = 1

curr_v = 2

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 4

permutation[4] = 2

curr_v = 3

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 8

permutation[8] = 3

curr_v = 4

i=1:

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 1

permutation[1] = 4

curr_v = 5

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 5

permutation[5] = 5

curr_v = 6

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 9

permutation[9] = 6

curr_v = 7

i=2:

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 2

permutation[2] = 7

curr_v = 8

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 6

permutation[6] = 8

curr_v = 9

i=3:

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 3

permutation[3] = 9

curr_v = 10

multiples_of_k_plus_i = 7

permutation[7] = 10

curr_v = 11

So, permutation = [1,4,7,9,2,5,8,10,3,6]

But earlier, I calculated the sums:

1+4+7+9=21

4+7+9+2=22

7+9+2+5=23

9+2+5+8=24

2+5+8+10=25

5+8+10+3=26

8+10+3+6=27

Difference between max and min sums: 27-21=6 >1

But in the example, with permutation [1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6], sums are 23,24,23,24,23,24,23.

So, the code's permutation doesn't satisfy the condition, while the example permutation does.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
