Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this concept of a "good" array, which is defined based on certain conditions involving another array B. The problem gives me an array C of length N, and I have to answer Q queries about whether a subarray of C is "good" or not.

First, I need to understand what makes an array "good." According to the description, an array A is good if there exists another array B of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in A is equal to the sum of elements in B.

2. For every index i, A[i] is not equal to B[i].

3. All elements in B are positive integers.

So, for a given subarray of C, from index L to R, I need to check if there exists an array B satisfying these three conditions.

Let me try to rephrase this in simpler terms. The sum of A and B must be equal, but their elements must all be different, and B must consist of positive integers only.

I need to find out, for each query, whether such a B exists for the specified subarray.

Let me think about what this implies.

First, since the sums must be equal, and A and B are different at every position, with B being positive, there must be some relationship between the elements of A and B.

Let me consider small examples to get a better understanding.

Suppose A has only one element. Say A = [3]. Then, I need B to have one element that is not equal to 3 but still sums up to 3. But B must have positive integers, so the smallest positive integer is 1. If B = [1], the sum is 1, which is not equal to 3. If B = [2], sum is 2, not 3. If B = [4], sum is 4, not 3. So, no B satisfies the conditions for a single-element A. Therefore, single-element arrays are not good.

Wait, but according to the sample input, sometimes single-element subarrays are not good, but in the sample output, some queries result in "YES" and others in "NO". Hmm, maybe I need to look at the sample input again.

Looking back at the sample input:

1

5 4

1 2 1 4 5

1 5

4 4

3 4

1 3

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

So, for the entire array (1 to 5), it's YES; for just the 4th element (4), it's NO; for the subarray from 3 to 4 (1 and 4), it's YES; and for the first three elements (1,2,1), it's NO.

From this, it seems that subarrays with more than one element can be good, while single-element subarrays are not.

Is that always the case? Let me think about it.

If A has two elements, say A = [1, 2], sum is 3. I need B = [x, y], where x != 1, y != 2, and x + y = 3, with x and y being positive integers.

Possible B:

- If x = 2, y = 1: sums to 3, x != 1, y != 2. Valid.

- If x = 1, y = 2: sums to 3, but x == 1, which is not allowed.

- If x = 3, y = 0: y is not positive.

- If x = 4, y = -1: y is not positive.

So, only B = [2, 1] works in this case.

Therefore, for A = [1, 2], there exists a B satisfying the conditions, so it's a good array.

Another example: A = [2, 2], sum is 4.

Possible B:

- [1, 3]: sums to 4, 1 != 2, 3 != 2. Valid.

- [3, 1]: sums to 4, 3 != 2, 1 != 2. Valid.

- [4, 0]: invalid, 0 is not positive.

- [5, -1]: invalid, negative.

So, multiple B satisfy the conditions.

Now, consider A = [1], as before. No B satisfies the conditions, so it's not good.

And A = [1, 1], sum is 2.

Possible B:

- [2, 0]: invalid, 0 is not positive.

- [1, 1]: invalid, because A[i] == B[i] for both indices.

- [0, 2]: invalid, 0 is not positive.

- [3, -1]: invalid, negative.

So, no B satisfies the conditions for A = [1, 1]. Therefore, subarrays with identical elements are not good, even if they have more than one element.

Wait, but in the sample input, the subarray from 3 to 4 is [1, 4], which is YES, and from 1 to 3 is [1,2,1], which is NO.

So, [1,4] is good because:

Possible B: [2,3], sums to 5, which matches A's sum, and neither B element equals A's corresponding element.

Similarly, [1,2,1], sum is 4.

Possible B:

- [2,1,1]: sums to 4, but B[1] == A[1], invalid.

- [1,3,0]: invalid, 0 is not positive.

- [2,3,-1]: invalid, negative.

- [3,1,0]: invalid, 0 is not positive.

- [2,2,0]: invalid, 0 is not positive.

- [1,1,2]: sums to 4, but A[1] == B[1], invalid.

- [3,2,-1]: invalid, negative.

Seems like no valid B exists for [1,2,1], so it's not good.

Wait, but [2,1,1] seems invalid because B[1] == A[1], which violates the condition that A[i] != B[i] for all i.

So, in this case, it's impossible to find such a B for [1,2,1].

Another example: A = [1,2,3], sum is 6.

Possible B:

- [2,1,3]: sums to 6, but B[3] == A[3], invalid.

- [2,3,1]: sums to 6, and all B[i] != A[i]. Valid.

So, [1,2,3] is good.

Wait, but in the sample input, [1,2,1] is not good, while [1,2,3] is good.

Seems like having duplicate elements in A can make it not good.

Wait, but in [1,4], there are no duplicates, and it's good.

In [1,2,1], there are duplicates, and it's not good.

In [1,2,3], no duplicates, good.

So, perhaps, if there are duplicates in A, it's not good.

But wait, what about A = [1,1,2], sum is 4.

Possible B:

- [2,2,0]: invalid, 0 is not positive.

- [2,1,1]: invalid, B[1] == A[1].

- [3,1,0]: invalid, 0 is not positive.

- [1,3,0]: invalid, 0 is not positive.

- [2,3,-1]: invalid, negative.

- [1,2,1]: invalid, B[1] == A[1].

- [3,2,-1]: invalid, negative.

Seems like no valid B exists for [1,1,2] either.

Wait, but what if A = [1,2,2], sum is 5.

Possible B:

- [2,1,2]: invalid, B[3] == A[3].

- [2,3,0]: invalid, 0 is not positive.

- [3,1,1]: sums to 5, and all B[i] != A[i]. Valid.

So, [1,2,2] is good.

Wait, but in the sample input, [1,2,1] is not good, while [1,2,2] is good.

So, it's not just about duplicates; there must be another condition.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider the minimal possible sum of B.

Since all B[i] must be positive integers and B[i] != A[i], the minimal possible B[i] is either A[i]-1 (if A[i] > 1) or A[i]+1 (if A[i] == 1).

Wait, but B[i] must be positive, so if A[i] == 1, B[i] cannot be 1, so it must be at least 2.

If A[i] > 1, B[i] can be A[i]-1, which is positive.

So, for each A[i], the minimal possible B[i] is:

- If A[i] == 1, B[i] >= 2

- If A[i] > 1, B[i] >= 1 (but B[i] != A[i]), so B[i] can be A[i]-1 if A[i] > 1.

Wait, but if A[i] > 1, B[i] can be A[i]-1, which is positive as long as A[i] >= 2.

So, for A[i] == 1, B[i] >= 2

For A[i] >= 2, B[i] >= 1, but B[i] != A[i].

So, the minimal sum of B is:

Sum over i of minimal B[i]

Which is:

For each A[i]:

if A[i] == 1, minimal B[i] = 2

if A[i] > 1, minimal B[i] = A[i] - 1

So, minimal sum of B is:

sum_{i=1 to m} (2 if A[i]==1 else A[i]-1)

Now, for B to have the same sum as A, we need:

sum(B) = sum(A)

But sum(B) >= minimal sum of B, as defined above.

So, if sum(A) >= minimal sum of B, and sum(A) == sum(B), then it's possible to have such a B.

But we also need to ensure that it's possible to assign B[i] such that all B[i] != A[i], and B[i] >= minimal B[i].

Wait, but if sum(A) == sum of minimal B, and we set B[i] to minimal B[i] for all i, then as long as B[i] != A[i], it should be okay.

Wait, but in some cases, even if sum(A) == minimal sum of B, it might still not be possible because of specific constraints on individual elements.

For example, in A = [1,2,1], sum is 4.

Minimal sum of B is:

For A[i]=1: B[i]=2

For A[i]=2: B[i]=1

So, minimal sum of B is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

But sum(A) = 4 < 5, so it's impossible to have such a B.

Hence, in this case, it's not good.

In another example, A = [1,4], sum is 5.

Minimal sum of B is 2 + 3 = 5, which equals sum(A). And setting B = [2,3] satisfies B[i] != A[i].

Hence, it's good.

Another example, A = [1,1,2], sum is 4.

Minimal sum of B is 2 + 2 + 1 = 5, which is greater than sum(A) = 4. So, not good.

A = [1,2,2], sum is 5.

Minimal sum of B is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, which is less than sum(A) = 5.

Is it possible to have B such that sum(B) = 5, B[i] != A[i], and B[i] >= minimal B[i]?

For example, B = [2,1,2], sum is 5, B[1] != A[1], B[2] != A[2], B[3] != A[3]. So, it's good.

Wait, but in this case, B[3] = 2, which is equal to A[3]. Oh, wait, that's not allowed.

Wait, B[3] must not equal A[3]. So, B[3] cannot be 2.

So, B = [2,1,2] is invalid because B[3] == A[3].

So, need to choose B[3] != 2, but minimal B[3] is 1.

So, B[3] must be at least 1 and not equal to 2, so B[3] >= 1 and B[3] != 2.

If A[3] = 2, then B[3] >=1 and B[3] !=2.

So, B[3] can be 1, but in that case, for A = [1,2,2], sum is 5.

If B = [2,1,2], sum is 5, but B[3] == A[3], which is invalid.

Wait, but A[3] = 2, B[3] =2, which is invalid.

So, B[3] must be at least 1 and not equal to 2, so B[3] >=1 and B[3] !=2.

Hence, B[3] must be at least 1 and not equal to 2, so B[3] >=1 and B[3] !=2.

So, B[3] can be 1,3,4,... but in this case, if B[3] =1, then sum of B is 2 +1 +1 =4, which is less than sum(A)=5.

If B[3] =3, then sum is 2 +1 +3 =6, which is more than sum(A)=5.

So, in this case, it's impossible to have sum(B)=5 with B[i] !=A[i] and B[i] >= minimal B[i].

Wait, but earlier I thought [3,2,-1] could work, but negative values are invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps in this case, it's impossible.

But according to my earlier thought, for A=[1,2,2], sum=5, minimal sum of B=2+1+1=4, which is less than sum(A)=5.

But in reality, to have sum(B)=5, with B[i] !=A[i], and B[i] >= minimal B[i], it seems impossible because:

- B[1] >=2, B[2] >=1, B[3] >=1, and B[i] !=A[i].

- A[1]=1, so B[1]>=2

- A[2]=2, so B[2]>=1 and B[2]!=2

- A[3]=2, so B[3]>=1 and B[3]!=2

So, B[1]=2, B[2]=1, B[3]=1: sum=4, which is less than 5.

To increase sum to 5, I need to increase some B[i].

If I increase B[1] to 3, then B=[3,1,1], sum=5, and all B[i] !=A[i]. This seems valid.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was impossible, but actually, B=[3,1,1] works.

So, yes, for A=[1,2,2], it's possible.

Wait, but in the sample input, [1,2,1] is not good, while [1,2,2] is good.

So, perhaps, in addition to sum(A) >= minimal sum of B, there is another condition to ensure that it's possible to adjust B[i] to match sum(A) without violating B[i] !=A[i].

Let me try to generalize this.

Let me define:

minimal_sum_B = sum over i of (2 if A[i]==1 else A[i]-1)

If sum(A) < minimal_sum_B, then it's impossible to have such a B.

If sum(A) >= minimal_sum_B, then it might be possible, but we need to ensure that we can adjust B[i] to match sum(A) without violating B[i] !=A[i].

Wait, but in the case of A=[1,2,1], sum(A)=4, minimal_sum_B=2+1+2=5, which is greater than sum(A), so it's impossible.

In A=[1,2,2], sum(A)=5, minimal_sum_B=2+1+1=4, which is less than sum(A)=5, and it's possible to set B=[3,1,1], sum=5.

In A=[1,4], sum=5, minimal_sum_B=2+3=5, which equals sum(A)=5, and B=[2,3] works.

In A=[4], sum=4, minimal_sum_B=3 (since A[1]=4, minimal B[1]=3), which is less than sum(A)=4, but in this case, B=[3], sum=3, which is less than 4. So, it's impossible to have sum(B)=4 with minimal_sum_B=3, but B[i] !=A[i].

Wait, but A=[4], sum=4, minimal_sum_B=3.

To have sum(B)=4, with B[1] >=3 and B[1] !=4.

So, B[1]=3 is possible, sum=3, which is less than 4.

To make sum=4, I need B[1]=4, but B[1] !=A[1]=4, so invalid.

Or B[1]=5, sum=5, which is more than 4.

So, no B satisfies sum(B)=4 with B[1] !=4 and B[1] >=3.

Hence, single-element arrays are not good, as per the sample input.

Wait, in the sample input, subarray of length 1 (query 2: 4 4, which is just c[4]=4, output is NO), which matches this conclusion.

So, in summary:

- If the subarray has only one element, it's not good.

- If the subarray has two or more elements, and sum(A) >= minimal_sum_B, then it's good.

But wait, in the case of A=[1,2,1], sum=4, minimal_sum_B=5, which is greater than sum(A), so it's not good.

In A=[1,2,2], sum=5, minimal_sum_B=4, which is less than sum(A)=5, and it's good.

In A=[1,4], sum=5, minimal_sum_B=5, which equals sum(A)=5, and it's good.

In A=[4], sum=4, minimal_sum_B=3, which is less than sum(A)=4, but it's not good.

Wait, so there's an exception here.

Wait, perhaps there's an additional condition.

Let me think about the difference between sum(A) and minimal_sum_B.

In the good cases:

- For A=[1,2,2], sum(A)=5, minimal_sum_B=4, difference=1

- For A=[1,4], sum(A)=5, minimal_sum_B=5, difference=0

In the not good cases:

- For A=[1,2,1], sum(A)=4, minimal_sum_B=5, difference=-1

- For A=[4], sum(A)=4, minimal_sum_B=3, difference=1, but it's not good.

Wait, so in A=[4], sum(A)=4, minimal_sum_B=3, difference=1, but it's not good.

But in A=[1,2,2], sum(A)=5, minimal_sum_B=4, difference=1, and it's good.

What's the difference?

Ah, perhaps it has to do with the number of times sum(A) - minimal_sum_B is distributed among the elements.

Wait, in A=[1,2,2], sum(A)=5, minimal_sum_B=4, difference=1.

I can assign this extra 1 to any B[i], as long as it doesn't make B[i] equal to A[i].

In this case, B=[3,1,1], where B[1]=3 (A[1]=1), B[2]=1 (A[2]=2), B[3]=1 (A[3]=2). So, it's valid.

In A=[4], sum(A)=4, minimal_sum_B=3, difference=1.

If I set B=[4], but B[1]=4 == A[1]=4, which is invalid.

Or B=[3], sum=3, which is less than 4.

Or B=[5], sum=5, which is more than 4, but B[1]=5 != A[1]=4.

But in this case, sum(B)=5 != sum(A)=4.

So, it's impossible.

Hence, for single-element subarrays, it's impossible.

For multi-element subarrays, it's possible if sum(A) >= minimal_sum_B.

Wait, but in A=[1,2,1], sum(A)=4, minimal_sum_B=5, which is greater than sum(A), so it's not good.

In A=[1,2,2], sum(A)=5, minimal_sum_B=4, which is less than sum(A)=5, and it's good.

In A=[1,4], sum(A)=5, minimal_sum_B=5, which is equal, and it's good.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If the subarray has only one element, it's not good.

- If the subarray has two or more elements, and sum(A) >= minimal_sum_B, then it's good.

- Otherwise, it's not good.

Let me test this hypothesis with the sample input.

Sample input:

n=5, q=4

c=[1,2,1,4,5]

Queries:

1. 1 to 5: subarray [1,2,1,4,5], sum=13

minimal_sum_B = 2 +1 +2 +3 +4 =12

sum(A)=13 >=12, so good. (YES)

2. 4 to 4: subarray [4], sum=4

minimal_sum_B=3

sum(A)=4 >=3, but single element, not good. (NO)

3. 3 to 4: subarray [1,4], sum=5

minimal_sum_B=2+3=5

sum(A)=5 >=5, so good. (YES)

4. 1 to 3: subarray [1,2,1], sum=4

minimal_sum_B=2+1+2=5

sum(A)=4 <5, so not good. (NO)

This matches the sample output.

Hence, the condition is:

- If the subarray has only one element, it's not good.

- If the subarray has two or more elements, and sum(A) >= minimal_sum_B, then it's good.

- Otherwise, it's
