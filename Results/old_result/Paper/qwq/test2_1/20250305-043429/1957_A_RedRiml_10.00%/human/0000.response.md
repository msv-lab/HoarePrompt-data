Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have a number of sticks with different lengths. I need to figure out the maximum number of regular polygons I can make from these sticks, where each polygon is made up of sticks of the same length, and no stick is used in more than one polygon. Also, sticks can't be broken, so I have to use them as they are.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all angles equal. So, for example, an equilateral triangle has three sides of the same length, a square has four sides of the same length, and so on. So, to form a regular polygon, I need at least 3 sticks of the same length because the smallest polygon is a triangle.

Looking at the problem, it seems like I need to count how many distinct side lengths I have, and for each side length, check if I have at least 3 sticks of that length. If I do, I can form at least one polygon with that side length. If I have more than 3 sticks of the same length, I might be able to form multiple polygons, but the problem seems to suggest that I can only use each stick in one polygon. So, I need to maximize the number of polygons, not necessarily use all sticks.

Wait, actually, the problem says to find the maximum number of regular polygons I can construct simultaneously, with each side formed by exactly one stick and no stick used in more than one polygon. So, for each polygon, I need a certain number of sticks of the same length, depending on the number of sides of the polygon.

But the problem doesn't specify the number of sides for the polygons; it just says "regular polygons," which means they can have any number of sides as long as it's at least 3.

So, to maximize the number of polygons, I should try to make as many small polygons as possible because smaller polygons require fewer sticks. For example, triangles require 3 sticks each, squares require 4, and so on.

Wait, but the problem allows me to choose polygons with different numbers of sides, as long as each polygon has all sides the same length and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

Looking back at the example:

In the third test case, with sticks of lengths 2,2,3,3,3,3, the output is 1, which corresponds to making one square with side length 3 using four sticks of length 3.

In the fourth test case, with sticks of lengths 4,2,2,2,2,4,2,4,4, the output is 2, which corresponds to making one pentagon with side length 2 (using five sticks of length 2) and one square with side length 4 (using four sticks of length 4).

Wait, but in the fourth test case, there are nine sticks: four of length 4 and five of length 2. So, I can make one polygon with side length 4 using four sticks, and one polygon with side length 2 using five sticks.

But in the third test case, there are six sticks: two of length 2 and four of length 3. So, I can make one polygon with side length 3 using four sticks, and I have two sticks of length 2 left, which aren't enough to form another polygon since I need at least three sticks for a polygon.

In the second test case, with two sticks of length 1 each, I can't form any polygon because I need at least three sticks of the same length.

In the first test case, with only one stick, obviously no polygon can be formed.

So, from this, it seems like the approach is to count the frequency of each stick length and then, for each frequency, determine how many polygons I can make with that stick length.

But the problem is to maximize the number of polygons formed simultaneously, without reusing sticks.

So, I need to assign sticks to polygons in such a way that I create as many polygons as possible, each using sticks of the same length.

One way to approach this is to consider each unique stick length separately and see how many polygons I can make from that length's sticks.

But wait, polygons with different numbers of sides can be made from the same stick length. For example, with sticks of length 3, I could make triangles (3 sides), squares (4 sides), pentagons (5 sides), etc., depending on how many sticks I have.

But to maximize the number of polygons, I should make as many small polygons as possible because they require fewer sticks.

So, for each stick length, I should make as many triangles as possible, since triangles require the fewest sticks (3 per triangle).

Wait, but in the example, in the third test case, they made a square instead of a triangle with the sticks of length 3.

Wait, let's think about it differently.

If I have k sticks of the same length, I can make floor(k/3) polygons, but these polygons could have 3, 4, 5, ... sides, depending on how I choose to use the sticks.

But since I want to maximize the number of polygons, I should make as many 3-sided polygons (triangles) as possible, because each triangle only consumes 3 sticks.

For example, if I have 6 sticks of the same length, I can make two triangles, or one square and one triangle, or one hexagon. But making two triangles allows me to create more polygons than the other options.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, they made one pentagon and one square, which uses 5 + 4 = 9 sticks, which is all the sticks they had. But if they had made three triangles instead, that would be 3 * 3 = 9 sticks, which would also use all the sticks, but that would be three polygons instead of two. So why is the answer 2?

Wait, maybe I misread the example.

Wait, in the fourth test case, they have nine sticks: four of length 4 and five of length 2. If I make one square with side length 4 (using four sticks) and one pentagon with side length 2 (using five sticks), that uses all nine sticks and creates two polygons.

If I try to make triangles, I could make two triangles with side length 2 (using six sticks) and one triangle with side length 4 (using three sticks), totaling three polygons, which seems better than the example's two polygons.

But according to the example, the output is 2, which suggests that the maximum number of polygons is 2, not 3.

Wait, perhaps I can't mix different stick lengths in this way because each polygon must have all sides of the same length, and no stick can be used in more than one polygon.

Wait, but in my proposed solution, I'm using all sticks of the same length for each polygon, and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

So why is the answer 2 in the example?

Wait, perhaps there is a constraint that I'm missing.

Looking back at the problem statement: "each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. No stick is used in more than one polygon."

So, I think the issue is that I can't have two polygons sharing sticks of the same length, but in my previous thought, I was proposing to make multiple polygons from the same stick length, which isn't allowed because each stick length can only be used to form one polygon.

Wait, no, the problem allows using multiple stick lengths to form multiple polygons, as long as no stick is used in more than one polygon.

But in the fourth test case, I have sticks of lengths 2 and 4. So, I can make one polygon with sticks of length 2 and another with sticks of length 4.

In the example, they made one pentagon with side length 2 and one square with side length 4, totaling two polygons.

But I could also make three triangles: two with side length 2 and one with side length 4.

Using sticks: for the two triangles with side length 2, that would use 6 sticks of length 2, and one triangle with side length 4 would use 3 sticks of length 4. But in the test case, there are only five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4.

Wait, in the fourth test case, there are nine sticks: four of length 4 and five of length 2.

So, if I make two triangles with side length 2 (using 6 sticks of length 2) and one triangle with side length 4 (using 3 sticks of length 4), but I only have five sticks of length 2, which isn't enough for two triangles (which would require six sticks of length 2). So, I can only make one triangle with side length 2 (using three sticks of length 2) and one triangle with side length 4 (using three sticks of length 4), totaling two polygons, with two sticks of length 2 left over.

Alternatively, I could make one pentagon with side length 2 (using five sticks of length 2) and one square with side length 4 (using four sticks of length 4), but that would require nine sticks, which I have, but according to my previous calculation, I can only make two polygons.

Wait, but in the example, they made one pentagon and one square, totaling two polygons.

So, perhaps making larger polygons isn't the way to maximize the number of polygons; in fact, making smaller polygons allows for more polygons.

But in this case, making two triangles (one with side length 2 and one with side length 4) would use three sticks of each, totaling six sticks, but I have nine sticks, so I could potentially make three triangles: two with side length 2 and one with side length 4.

But as I realized, I only have five sticks of length 2, which isn't enough for two triangles (which would require six sticks of length 2). So, I can only make one triangle with side length 2 and one triangle with side length 4, totaling two polygons, which matches the example's output of 2.

So, the key is to maximize the number of polygons by making as many small polygons as possible, but constrained by the available sticks for each length.

So, for each stick length, I need to determine how many polygons I can make from that length's sticks, and then sum up the number of polygons across all stick lengths.

In other words, for each unique stick length, I can make floor(frequency / sides) polygons, where sides is the number of sides for the polygon.

But to maximize the total number of polygons, I should make as many triangles as possible because triangles require the fewest sticks.

Wait, but I need to consider that for a given stick length, I can only make one polygon, since all sides must be of that length.

Wait, no, actually, I can make multiple polygons from the same stick length, as long as I have enough sticks.

For example, if I have 6 sticks of the same length, I can make two triangles, which are two separate polygons.

But in the previous test case, I had only five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4, which allowed for one triangle with side length 2 and one triangle with side length 4, totaling two polygons.

So, in general, for each unique stick length, I can make floor(frequency / 3) polygons, since triangles require the fewest sticks.

But, in the third test case, they made one square with side length 3 using four sticks, even though they could have made one triangle with three sticks and have one stick left over.

But according to my approach, floor(4 / 3) = 1 polygon, which matches making one triangle, but in the example, they made one square.

Wait, but in the example, they made one square, which is also one polygon.

So, in that case, making a square instead of a triangle doesn't change the number of polygons.

But if I have more sticks, making smaller polygons would allow for more polygons.

For example, with seven sticks of the same length, I could make two triangles (using six sticks) and have one stick left over, or make one square and one triangle (using four + three = seven sticks), but that would only be two polygons as well.

Wait, but in that case, making two triangles would use six sticks and leave one stick unused, whereas making one square and one triangle would use all seven sticks.

But the number of polygons is the same: two.

So, perhaps it's optimal to make as many triangles as possible.

But in the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 2, I can make one triangle with three sticks and have two sticks left over, which aren't enough for another polygon.

Similarly, with four sticks of length 4, I can make one triangle with three sticks and have one stick left over.

But in the example, they made one pentagon with five sticks of length 2 and one square with four sticks of length 4, using all nine sticks.

But according to my earlier calculation, that would be two polygons, which matches the example's output.

So, perhaps the approach is to make one polygon per stick length, choosing the largest possible polygon for each stick length, but that doesn't seem to maximize the number of polygons.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, making one pentagon with five sticks of length 2 and one square with four sticks of length 4 gives two polygons, which is the same as making one triangle with three sticks of length 2 and one triangle with three sticks of length 4, with two sticks of length 2 left over.

So, in that case, both approaches give two polygons.

But if I have, say, six sticks of one length, I could make two triangles, which would be two polygons, or one hexagon, which would be one polygon.

So, making smaller polygons allows for more polygons.

Hence, to maximize the number of polygons, I should aim to make as many triangles as possible.

But in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, making one square is just one polygon, same as making one triangle and having one stick left over.

So, in that case, it's the same number of polygons.

But with six sticks of length 3, I could make two triangles or one hexagon, but two triangles would be better in terms of maximizing the number of polygons.

So, perhaps the strategy is, for each stick length, to make as many triangles as possible, since triangles allow for the maximum number of polygons per stick.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 2, I can make one triangle and have two sticks left over.

But in the example, they made one pentagon, which is still one polygon.

So, in that case, making one triangle and leaving two sticks unused still gives one polygon, but in the example, they made two polygons by using all sticks.

Wait, no, in the fourth test case, they made one pentagon and one square, totaling two polygons.

But according to my earlier calculation, I can only make one triangle with three sticks of length 2 and one triangle with three sticks of length 4, but I only have five sticks of length 2, which isn't enough for two triangles of length 2; I'd need six sticks for two triangles.

Wait, I have five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4.

So, for length 2:

- floor(5 / 3) = 1 triangle, with two sticks left over.

For length 4:

- floor(4 / 3) = 1 triangle, with one stick left over.

Total polygons: 2.

Which matches the example's output of 2.

So, perhaps the approach is to calculate, for each unique stick length, floor(frequency / 3), since triangles require three sticks each.

Then, sum up these values for all stick lengths to get the total number of polygons.

This seems consistent with the example.

In the third test case, with four sticks of length 3:

- floor(4 / 3) = 1 polygon, which matches making one square.

In the fourth test case:

- floor(5 / 3) = 1 (for length 2)

- floor(4 / 3) = 1 (for length 4)

- Total: 2 polygons.

So, it seems that this approach works.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

w = int(input())

for _ in range(w):

ln = int(input())

palka = list(map(int, input().split()))

pl = []

d = {}

for i in palka:

if d.get(i) == None:

d[i] = 1

else:

d[i] += 1

if i not in pl:

pl.append(i)

shapes = 0

for j in pl:

if d[j] >= 3:

shapes += 1

print(shapes)

So, the function reads the number of test cases, w.

For each test case, it reads the number of sticks, ln, and the list of stick lengths, palka.

Then, it initializes an empty list pl and a dictionary d.

It iterates through the stick lengths, counting the frequency of each length using the dictionary d, and also collecting unique lengths in pl.

Then, it initializes shapes to 0.

For each unique length in pl, if the frequency in d is >= 3, it increments shapes by 1.

Finally, it prints the number of shapes.

Wait a minute, this seems different from what I thought.

According to this code, for each unique stick length, if there are at least 3 sticks of that length, it counts one polygon, regardless of how many sticks there are.

So, in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, it would count one polygon.

In the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4, it would count one polygon for each length, totaling two polygons.

Which matches the example's output.

But according to my earlier reasoning, this seems too simplistic.

Because, for a given stick length, if I have more sticks, I could make more polygons.

But the code only counts one polygon per stick length if there are at least three sticks.

Wait, but in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, making one square is acceptable, and according to the example, that's correct.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, making one pentagon and one square is acceptable.

But, if I had, say, six sticks of one length, according to this code, it would still count only one polygon for that length, but according to my earlier reasoning, I could make two triangles.

But, in that case, making two triangles would be better than making one hexagon, as it increases the number of polygons.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, with five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4, the output is 2, which matches the code's approach.

But according to my earlier thought, with five sticks of length 2, I could make one triangle and have two sticks left over, which is one polygon, or make one pentagon, which is one polygon.

So, in that case, it's the same.

But with six sticks of one length, the code would count one polygon, but I could make two triangles, which would be two polygons.

So, in that case, the code would be incorrect.

Wait, but the problem constraints specify that n ≤ 100, and the number of test cases t ≤ 100, but I don't think that affects this logic.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks available."

So, in the case where I have six sticks of one length, I can make two triangles, which are two separate polygons.

But according to the code, it would only count one polygon for that length.

Hence, the code seems incorrect in that scenario.

But in the provided examples, it seems to work.

Wait, but perhaps the problem intends to allow only one polygon per stick length.

Looking back at the problem statement, it doesn't specify any restriction on the number of polygons per stick length.

It only says that each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick, and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

So, multiple polygons can be made from the same stick length, as long as you have enough sticks.

For example, with six sticks of one length, I can make two triangles, which are two polygons.

Hence, the code seems incorrect because it only counts one polygon per stick length, regardless of how many sticks are available.

Wait, but in the example, with five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4, the output is 2, which matches the code's approach.

But according to my earlier thought, with five sticks of length 2, I could make one triangle and have two sticks left over, which would be one polygon, and with four sticks of length 4, make one triangle and have one stick left over, totaling two polygons.

Which matches the code's output.

But if I had six sticks of one length, according to the code, it would count one polygon, but I could make two triangles, which would be two polygons.

Hence, the code seems incorrect.

So, perhaps the problem expects only one polygon per stick length.

But in that case, in the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4, making one pentagon and one square would be acceptable, giving two polygons, which matches the code's output.

But according to my earlier thought, making two triangles would also be acceptable, but that would require six sticks of one length, which isn't the case in the fourth test case.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, there are five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4, totaling nine sticks.

Making one pentagon with five sticks of length 2 and one square with four sticks of length 4 uses all nine sticks and creates two polygons.

Alternatively, making one triangle with three sticks of length 2 and one triangle with three sticks of length 4 uses six sticks and leaves three sticks unused, which would still be two polygons.

But according to the problem, the maximum number of polygons is two, which matches the code's output.

Hence, perhaps the code is correct.

But in the scenario where I have six sticks of one length, the code would count one polygon, but I could make two triangles, which would be two polygons.

So, in that case, the code would be incorrect.

But perhaps such a test case isn't considered in the problem's examples.

Hence, I need to consider whether the problem allows making multiple polygons from the same stick length or not.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says "each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. No stick is used in more than one polygon."

This implies that sticks of the same length can be used in different polygons, as long as they aren't shared between polygons.

Hence, if I have multiple polygons, each can have sides of the same length, as long as the sticks are distinct.

So, with six sticks of one length, I can make two triangles, each using three distinct sticks.

Hence, the code seems incorrect because it only counts one polygon per stick length, even if more polygons can be made.

Wait, but perhaps the code is correct because for each stick length, it checks if there are at least three sticks, and counts one polygon per stick length.

But according to the problem, I can make multiple polygons from the same stick length, as long as I have enough sticks.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to, for each stick length, calculate floor(frequency / 3), since each triangle requires three sticks.

Then, sum up these values for all stick lengths.

This would give the maximum number of triangles I can make, which should be the maximum number of polygons, since triangles require the fewest sticks.

Hence, in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, floor(4 / 3) = 1 polygon.

In the fourth test case, floor(5 / 3) + floor(4 / 3) = 1 + 1 = 2 polygons.

Which matches the example's output.

In the first test case, with one stick, floor(1 / 3) = 0 polygons.

In the second test case, with two sticks, floor(2 / 3) = 0 polygons.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

So, the provided code is actually correct, because it's counting floor(frequency / 3) for each stick length, which is equivalent to counting how many times 3 divides into the frequency.

But looking back at the code, it seems like it's only checking if the frequency is >= 3 and incrementing shapes by 1 if it is.

Wait, that's not the same as floor(frequency / 3).

Wait, the code is:

for j in pl:

if d[j] >= 3:

shapes += 1

So, for each stick length, if there are at least 3 sticks, it increments shapes by 1.

Hence, it's counting one polygon per stick length if there are at least 3 sticks.

But earlier, I thought that floor(frequency / 3) would give the number of polygons per stick length.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

In the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, floor(4 / 3) = 1 polygon, which matches the code's approach.

In the fourth test case, floor(5 / 3) + floor(4 / 3) = 1 + 1 = 2 polygons, which again matches the code's approach.

Wait, but earlier I thought that floor(frequency / 3) gives the maximum number of triangles I can make from that stick length.

But in reality, for each stick length, making one polygon that uses as many sticks as possible might be more efficient in some cases.

Wait, but in the third test case, making one square uses four sticks, which is more than making one triangle with three sticks and leaving one stick unused.

But in terms of the number of polygons, it's the same: one polygon.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, making one pentagon with five sticks and one square with four sticks uses all nine sticks and creates two polygons, which is the same as making one triangle with three sticks of length 2 and one triangle with three sticks of length 4, using six sticks and leaving three sticks unused, but still only two polygons.

Hence, perhaps the number of polygons is the same regardless of the approach.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

But in the scenario where I have six sticks of one length, floor(6 / 3) = 2 polygons, which matches making two triangles.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Wait, but in the code, it's only counting one polygon per stick length if there are at least three sticks.

Wait, that's not what the code is doing.

Wait, actually, looking back at the code:

for j in pl:

if d[j] >= 3:

shapes += 1

So, for each unique stick length, if there are at least three sticks, it counts one polygon.

Hence, in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, it counts one polygon.

In the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4, it counts one polygon for each length, totaling two polygons.

But according to floor(frequency / 3), for six sticks of one length, it should be two polygons, which matches making two triangles.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Wait, but for six sticks of one length, according to the code, it would count only one polygon, but floor(6 / 3) = 2, which suggests that it should count two polygons.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back:

for j in pl:

if d[j] >= 3:

shapes += 1

So, for each unique stick length with at least three sticks, it increments shapes by one.

Hence, for six sticks of one length, it would count one polygon, but according to floor(6 / 3) = 2, it should be two polygons.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier test cases, it seems to work.

But in this hypothetical test case with six sticks of one length, the code would be incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the correct approach should be to calculate floor(frequency / 3) for each stick length and sum them up.

Hence, the code should be:

for j in pl:

shapes += floor(d[j] / 3)

Then, print shapes.

But in the provided code, it's only checking if d[j] >= 3 and incrementing shapes by one if it is.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the examples, it seems to produce the correct output.

But according to my reasoning, it's incorrect.

Perhaps the problem expects only one polygon per stick length.

But in that case, it's suboptimal because I could make more polygons.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, "Find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously, such that:

Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick.

No stick is used in more than one polygon."

Hence, the goal is to maximize the number of polygons, not necessarily to use all sticks.

Hence, making smaller polygons allows for more polygons.

Hence, the correct approach is to make as many triangles as possible, since triangles require the fewest sticks.

Hence, for each stick length, calculate floor(frequency / 3), and sum these values across all stick lengths.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect because it only counts one polygon per stick length if there are at least three sticks.

So, in conclusion, the provided code is incorrect.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from given sticks of various lengths, ensuring that each polygon has sides of the same length and no stick is reused.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - Each polygon must have all sides of equal length.
   - Each stick can only be used in one polygon.
   - We aim to maximize the number of such polygons.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize the number of polygons, we should prefer forming smaller polygons (triangles) because they require fewer sticks.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each unique stick length, calculate how many triangles (3 sides) can be formed.
   - Use the formula `floor(frequency / 3)` to determine the number of triangles that can be formed with that stick length.
   - Sum these values across all unique stick lengths to get the total number of polygons.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
        freq = {}
        for stick in sticks:
            freq[stick] = freq.get(stick, 0) + 1
        polygons = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            polygons += count // 3  # Equivalent to floor division by 3
        print(polygons)

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the number of sticks `n` and the list of their lengths.

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each stick length.

3. **Calculate Polygons**:
   - For each frequency count, compute how many triangles can be formed using integer division `count // 3`.
   - Sum these values to get the total number of polygons.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the total number of polygons for each test case.

This approach ensures that we maximize the number of polygons by forming as many triangles as possible from the available sticks for each length.
