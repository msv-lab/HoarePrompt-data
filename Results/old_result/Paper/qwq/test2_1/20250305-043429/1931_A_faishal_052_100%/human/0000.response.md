Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Nikita has a word consisting of exactly three lowercase Latin letters. Each letter corresponds to a number from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, up to 'z' is 26. He encodes the word by summing up the positions of these letters. For example, "cat" is 3 + 1 + 20 = 24. But this encoding is ambiguous because different words can have the same sum, like "ava" also sums to 24.

My task is to, given the sum, find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded to that sum. So, for each test case with a given sum, I need to output the smallest possible word made of three letters that add up to that sum.

First, I need to understand what lexicographical order means. It's basically dictionary order. So, "a" comes before "b", "ab" comes before "ac", and so on. For three-letter words, the first letter is most significant, then the second, then the third.

So, to find the smallest word, I should minimize the first letter, then the second, and then the third.

Given that, I should try to assign the smallest possible value to the first letter, then to the second, and finally to the third, while ensuring that their sum is equal to the given number.

Each letter can be from 1 to 26, inclusive.

Let's think about how to approach this.

One way is to iterate through possible values of the first letter starting from 1 up to 26, and for each value of the first letter, iterate through possible values of the second letter from 1 to 26, and then set the third letter to be the remaining sum minus the first and second letters, as long as it's between 1 and 26.

But this approach could be inefficient, especially since t can be up to 100 and n can be up to 78. But since n is only up to 78 and the number of possible combinations is small (26^3 = 17,576), it's manageable. However, I should look for a smarter way to directly compute the smallest word without iterating through all possibilities.

Let's consider that to make the word lexicographically smallest, I should minimize the first letter as much as possible, then the second, and then the third.

So, I should set the first letter to the smallest possible value, which is 1, and then set the second letter to the smallest possible value, which is 1, and then set the third letter to be the remaining sum minus 2, as long as it's between 1 and 26.

If the remaining sum after setting the first two letters to 1 is less than 1, that means it's not possible to have first two letters as 1, so I need to increase one of the previous letters.

Wait, but since the sum is at least 3 (1+1+1), and n can be up to 78 (26+26+26), it's within range.

Let me try to formalize this.

Letâ€™s denote the three letters as a, b, c, where each is between 1 and 26 inclusive, and a + b + c = n.

I need to find the smallest (a, b, c) in lexicographical order such that a + b + c = n.

To minimize a, I should set a to the smallest possible value, which is 1, and then minimize b, and then c.

So, set a = 1.

Then, set b = 1, and set c = n - 2.

But c must be between 1 and 26.

So, if n - 2 <= 26 and n - 2 >= 1, then a = 1, b = 1, c = n - 2 is a valid word.

If n - 2 > 26, then c would be greater than 26, which is invalid. So, I need to increase b.

Set b = 1 + k, where k is the minimum number such that c = n - 1 - (1 + k) = n - 2 - k <= 26.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to set a = 1, and then set b to the smallest possible value such that c = n - 1 - b is between 1 and 26.

So, for a = 1, b should be between 1 and 26, and c = n - 1 - b should also be between 1 and 26.

So, b should satisfy:

1 <= n - 1 - b <= 26

Which simplifies to:

n - 27 <= b <= n - 2

But since b must also be between 1 and 26, the actual range for b is:

max(1, n - 27) <= b <= min(26, n - 2)

So, for a = 1, b can be from max(1, n - 27) to min(26, n - 2).

Then, c = n - 1 - b.

This would give me the smallest possible a, and within that, the smallest possible b, and then c is determined.

But I need to make sure that for a = 1, there exists a b in that range.

If n - 2 <= 26, which is n <= 28, then b can be from 1 to n - 2.

If n - 27 >= 1, which is n >= 28, then b can be from n - 27 to 26.

Wait, let's think about n = 24 as in the example.

For n = 24, a = 1, b can be from max(1, 24 - 27) = max(1, -3) = 1 to min(26, 24 - 2) = min(26, 22) = 22.

So, b can be from 1 to 22.

Then c = 24 - 1 - b = 23 - b.

For b = 1, c = 22.

So, the word would be a + a + v, which is "aav".

That matches the first example.

Another example is n = 3.

For n = 3, a = 1, b = max(1, 3 - 27) = 1 to min(26, 3 - 2) = min(26, 1) = 1.

So, b = 1, c = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1.

So, "aaa", which is correct.

Another example is n = 78.

a = 1, b = max(1, 78 - 27) = max(1, 51) = 51, but b cannot exceed 26, so b = 26, c = 78 - 1 - 26 = 51, which is invalid since c > 26.

So, a = 1 doesn't work here.

Then, increase a to 2.

Now, b can be from max(1, 78 - 27) = 1 to min(26, 78 - 2) = 26.

But c = 78 - 2 - b = 76 - b.

To have c <= 26, 76 - b <= 26 => b >= 50, but b <= 26, so no solution with a = 2.

Wait, but 78 is 26 + 26 + 26, so a = 26, b = 26, c = 26, which is "zzz".

But "rzz" is the expected output for n = 70.

Wait, but for n = 78, it should be "zzz".

But in the example output, for n = 70, it's "rzz".

Wait, let's check the example input and output again.

Input:

5

24

70

3

55

48

Output:

aav

rzz

aaa

czz

auz

Wait, for n = 70, it's "rzz".

So, 70 = 18 + 26 + 26.

'r' is the 18th letter.

So, a = 18, b = 26, c = 26.

This is "rzz".

Similarly, for n = 55, it's "czz", which is 3 + 26 + 26 = 55.

For n = 48, it's "auz", which is 1 + 21 + 26 = 48.

So, the general approach seems to be setting a as small as possible, then b as small as possible, and c as large as possible.

Wait, but in n = 70, a = 18 is not the smallest possible.

Wait, why not a = 1, b = 26, c = 43, but c > 26, invalid.

Then a = 2, b = 26, c = 42, still invalid.

Continue increasing a until c <= 26.

So, a = 70 - 26 - 26 = 18.

So, a = 18, b = 26, c = 26.

Hence, "rzz".

This seems to confirm the approach.

So, to generalize:

To make the word lexicographically smallest, minimize a, then minimize b, given a, then c is determined as n - a - b.

But, c must be between 1 and 26.

So, for given a, b should be as small as possible such that c = n - a - b is between 1 and 26.

If for a given a, there exists no b such that 1 <= n - a - b <= 26, then increment a and try again.

Otherwise, set b to the smallest possible value where c = n - a - b <= 26 and c >= 1.

So, b should be as small as possible, but not smaller than n - a - 26.

Because c = n - a - b <= 26 => b >= n - a - 26.

Also, b >= 1.

So, b should be at least max(1, n - a - 26).

And b should be at most min(26, n - a - 1).

Because c >=1 => b <= n - a -1.

So, for given a, b should be in [max(1, n - a - 26), min(26, n - a -1)].

If this interval is non-empty, then set b to the smallest possible value in this interval, which is max(1, n - a - 26).

Then, c = n - a - b.

This should give the lexicographically smallest word.

Let's test this with n = 24.

a = 1, b = max(1, 24 -1 -26) = max(1, -23) =1, b <= min(26,24-1-1)=min(26,22)=22.

So, b =1, c=24-1-1=22 => "aav".

n=3: a=1, b=max(1,3-1-26)=max(1,-24)=1, b<=min(26,3-1-1)=min(26,1)=1 => b=1, c=1 => "aaa".

n=70: a=1, b=max(1,70-1-26)=max(1,43)=43, which is >26, so no solution.

a=2, b=max(1,70-2-26)=max(1,42)=42 >26, no.

...

a=18, b=max(1,70-18-26)=max(1,26)=26.

So, b=26, c=70-18-26=26 => "rzz".

n=55: a=3, b=max(1,55-3-26)=max(1,26)=26, c=55-3-26=26 => "czz".

n=48: a=1, b=max(1,48-1-26)=max(1,21)=21, c=48-1-21=26 => "auz".

Yes, this seems correct.

So, in code, for each test case, I need to iterate a from 1 to 26, and for each a, compute b = max(1, n - a -26), and check if b <= min(26, n - a -1).

If b <= min(26, n - a -1), then set b = max(1, n - a -26), and c = n - a - b.

If b > min(26, n - a -1), then try the next a.

Once I find such a, b, c, then that's the smallest word.

Alternatively, since a is increasing, and b is minimized for each a, this should give the lex smallest word.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see what it's doing.

def func():

cases = int(input())

info = []

for i in range(cases):

arr = []

lex = int(input())

for j in range(2):

if lex < 28:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex - 1

elif lex < 52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex - 26

elif lex <= 78:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex - 26

arr.append(lex)

arr.sort()

info.append(arr)

for i in range(cases):

temp = ''

for j in range(3):

temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)

print(temp)

So, it reads the number of cases, then for each case, reads n, then in a loop for j in range(2), it appends either 1 or 26 to arr depending on the value of lex.

If lex < 28, append 1 and set lex = lex -1.

elif lex <52, append 26 and set lex = lex -26.

elif lex <=78, append 26 and set lex = lex -26.

Then, append lex to arr, sort arr, and then convert to letters and print.

Wait, but lex is the sum to encode, and arr is supposed to be the three letters.

But the logic seems flawed.

For example, for n=24, according to the example, it should output "aav".

But according to this code:

For n=24, lex=24.

j=0:

24 <28, so append 1, lex=23.

j=1:

23 <28, so append 1, lex=22.

Then append 22.

So, arr=[1,1,22], sorted as [1,1,22], which is "aav", which matches the example.

For n=70:

j=0:

70 <28? No.

70 <52? No.

70 <=78, append 26, lex=44.

j=1:

44 <28? No.

44 <52? No.

44 <=78, append 26, lex=18.

Then append 18.

So, arr=[18,26,26], sorted to [18,26,26], which is "rzz", matching the example.

For n=3:

j=0:

3 <28, append 1, lex=2.

j=1:

2 <28, append 1, lex=1.

Then append 1.

arr=[1,1,1], sorted as [1,1,1], which is "aaa", correct.

For n=55:

j=0:

55 <28? No.

55 <52? No.

55 <=78, append 26, lex=29.

j=1:

29 <28? No.

29 <52? Yes, append 26, lex=3.

Then append 3.

arr=[3,26,26], sorted to [3,26,26], which is "czz", correct.

For n=48:

j=0:

48 <28? No.

48 <52? No.

48 <=78, append 26, lex=22.

j=1:

22 <28, append 1, lex=21.

Then append 21.

arr=[1,21,26], sorted to [1,21,26], which is "auz", correct.

So, in these examples, it seems to work.

But is this approach generally correct?

Let's consider what the code is doing.

It's processing the sum in two steps, and in each step, it decides to append either 1 or 26 based on the remaining sum.

Specifically:

- If the remaining sum is less than 28, it appends 1 and subtracts 1.

- If the remaining sum is less than 52, it appends 26 and subtracts 26.

- If the remaining sum is up to 78, it appends 26 and subtracts 26.

Then, it appends the remaining sum and sorts the array.

In the examples above, it seems to produce the correct result.

But is this a general solution?

Let me try to see if this always gives the lex smallest word.

Take n=27.

According to the code:

j=0:

27 <28, append 1, lex=26.

j=1:

26 <28? No, 26 <52? Yes, append 26, lex=0.

Then append 0, but lex should be >=1, so maybe there's an error.

Wait, but lex is supposed to be the remaining sum to reach n.

Wait, in the code, it appends lex even if it's 0, but letter values are from 1 to 26.

In the earlier cases, lex was at least 1, but in this case, lex=0, which is invalid.

But according to the problem, n >=3, and with three letters, each at least 1, n >=3, so lex should not reach 0.

Wait, in this case, n=27.

Following the approach:

a=1, b=1, c=25. Which is "a y z".

But according to the code:

arr=[1,26,0], which is invalid, but since it sorts [1,26,0], and then converts to letters, but 0 is invalid.

Wait, in Python, chr(0 +96) = chr(96), which is '`', which is invalid.

So, this is a problem.

But in the problem, n >=3, and with a=1, b=1, c=25=27-1-1=25, which is valid.

So, the code is incorrect here.

Another test case: n=28.

According to the code:

j=0:

28 <28? No.

28 <52? Yes, append 26, lex=2.

j=1:

2 <28, append 1, lex=1.

Then append 1.

arr=[1,1,26], sorted to [1,1,26], which is "a a z".

But the correct smallest word should be "a a z", which is correct.

Wait, but in n=27, it gives [1,26,0], which is invalid.

Wait, but n=27 should be a=1, b=1, c=25, which is "a y z".

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given value `n`, where each letter corresponds to a number from 1 to 26 in the alphabet.

### Approach
1. **Understand Lexicographical Order**: To get the smallest word, we should minimize the first letter, then the second, and finally the third.
2. **Constraints**: Each letter must be between 'a' (1) and 'z' (26), and their sum should be equal to `n`.
3. **Algorithm**:
   - Iterate through possible values for the first letter (`a`) starting from 1 to 26.
   - For each value of `a`, iterate through possible values for the second letter (`b`) starting from 1 to 26.
   - Calculate the third letter (`c`) as `n - a - b`.
   - Check if `c` is between 1 and 26.
   - Among all valid combinations, choose the one that is lexicographically smallest.

### Solution Code
```python
def find_smallest_word(n):
    for a in range(1, 27):
        for b in range(1, 27):
            c = n - a - b
            if 1 <= c <= 26:
                return chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
    return ""  # In case no valid combination is found

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(data[i+1])
        print(find_smallest_word(n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **find_smallest_word Function**:
   - Iterates `a` from 1 to 26.
   - For each `a`, iterates `b` from 1 to 26.
   - Computes `c` as `n - a - b`.
   - If `c` is between 1 and 26, it forms the word and returns it.
   - This ensures that we get the smallest possible word in lexicographical order.

2. **main Function**:
   - Reads input values.
   - Processes each test case by calling `find_smallest_word` and prints the result.

This approach ensures that we find the smallest possible word for each test case efficiently, adhering to the constraints provided.
