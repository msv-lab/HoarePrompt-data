Alright, I have this problem to solve. I need to determine whether a given binary grid forms a square or a triangle based on the placement of '1's. The grid is square, with size n x n, and n can be from 2 to 10. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have to output either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the shape formed by the '1's.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a square and a triangle in this context.

A square is defined as k consecutive rows, each containing k '1's, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge. So, for a square, the '1's should form a perfect square block somewhere in the grid.

A triangle is defined as k consecutive rows, where the i-th row has 2*i - 1 '1's, and they are centered in one column. An upside-down triangle is also valid. So, for a triangle, the '1's should form a pyramid shape, either right side up or inverted.

Given that the grid contains exactly one shape, either a square or a triangle, and it's guaranteed that the shape size is greater than 1 (meaning at least 2 '1's), I need to analyze the grid to determine which shape is present.

Looking at the provided code:

```python

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for i in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        a = 0

        b = ''

        for j in range(n):

            s = input()

            if s.count('1') == 1:

                a = 'TRIANGLE'

            elif s.count('1') > 1:

                b = 'SQUARE'

        if a != 0:

            print(a)

        else:

            print(b)

```

This code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and then n lines of the grid. It counts the number of '1's in each row and based on that, sets variables a and b to 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' respectively.

The logic seems straightforward: if a row has exactly one '1', it's a triangle; if a row has more than one '1', it's a square.

But I need to verify if this logic is sufficient to distinguish between squares and triangles as defined.

Let's consider some examples.

Example 1:

Input:

3

000

011

011

Output:

SQUARE

In this 3x3 grid:

Row 1: 000 → 0 '1's

Row 2: 011 → 2 '1's

Row 3: 011 → 2 '1's

According to the code, since rows 2 and 3 have more than one '1', b is set to 'SQUARE', and since a is not set, it prints 'SQUARE'. This matches the expected output.

Example 2:

Input:

4

0000

0000

0100

1110

Output:

TRIANGLE

Grid:

Row 1: 0000 → 0 '1's

Row 2: 0000 → 0 '1's

Row 3: 0100 → 1 '1'

Row 4: 1110 → 3 '1's

According to the code, row 3 has 1 '1', so a is set to 'TRIANGLE', and row 4 has more than one '1', so b is set to 'SQUARE'. But since a is set, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. This seems correct because the '1's form a triangle.

Wait, but according to the problem, the output is "TRIANGLE", which matches the code's output.

Another example:

Input:

2

11

11

Output:

SQUARE

Grid:

Row 1: 11 → 2 '1's

Row 2: 11 → 2 '1's

So, b is set to 'SQUARE', and since a is not set, it prints 'SQUARE'. Correct.

Another example:

Input:

5

00111

00010

00000

00000

00000

Output:

TRIANGLE

Grid:

Row 1: 00111 → 3 '1's

Row 2: 00010 → 1 '1'

Row 3: 00000 → 0 '1's

Row 4: 00000 → 0 '1's

Row 5: 00000 → 0 '1's

Here, row 1 has 3 '1's, row 2 has 1 '1', so a is set to 'TRIANGLE' and b is set to 'SQUARE'. But since a is set, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. Correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, this should be a triangle, which matches the code's output.

Another example:

Input:

10

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

1111111110

0111111100

0011111000

0001110000

0000100000

Output:

TRIANGLE

Grid:

Row 1 to 5: all 0's

Row 6: 1111111110 → 9 '1's

Row 7: 0111111100 → 7 '1's

Row 8: 0011111000 → 5 '1's

Row 9: 0001110000 → 3 '1's

Row 10: 0000100000 → 1 '1'

So, rows 6 to 10 have 9,7,5,3,1 '1's respectively, which forms a triangle. According to the code, rows with more than one '1' set b to 'SQUARE', and rows with one '1' set a to 'TRIANGLE'. Since a is set, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. Correct.

Last example:

Input:

3

111

111

111

Output:

SQUARE

Grid:

Row 1: 111 → 3 '1's

Row 2: 111 → 3 '1's

Row 3: 111 → 3 '1's

So, b is set to 'SQUARE', and since a is not set, it prints 'SQUARE'. This should be a square, but wait, is this a square or a triangle?

According to the problem, a square is k rows with k '1's each, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge. Here, each row has 3 '1's, and they are aligned, so it's a square.

But could this be interpreted as a triangle? Well, in the problem's triangle definition, it's about consecutive rows with increasing or decreasing number of '1's, centered in one column. Here, all rows have the same number of '1's, so it's definitely a square.

So, the code correctly identifies it as a square.

Now, I need to think if there are any cases where this logic might fail.

Consider a square that is not aligned to the left edge, but is shifted to the right. For example:

n=3

Row 1: 011

Row 2: 011

Row 3: 011

According to the code, each row has 2 '1's, so b is set to 'SQUARE', and a is not set, so it prints 'SQUARE'. But visually, this is a square shifted to the right. Does the problem allow squares to be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge? The problem says "the i-th row has k consecutive characters '1', which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge." So, in this case, the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge, which is 1 in each row. So, this should be considered a square.

Another case:

n=4

Row 1: 0011

Row 2: 0011

Row 3: 0011

Row 4: 0011

This should be a square, and the code would correctly identify it as such.

Now, for triangles.

A triangle has k rows, with the i-th row having 2*i - 1 '1's, centered in one column.

For example, k=3:

Row 1:   1

Row 2:  111

Row 3: 11111

Centered in one column.

But in the grid, it's a bit tricky because the grid is n x n, and the triangle could be placed anywhere.

Wait, but according to the problem, the triangle has central 1s located in one column, meaning that all rows have their '1's centered around a single column.

So, in the grid, the '1's should be aligned in a column, with the number of '1's in each row increasing or decreasing by 2 each time.

Wait, no. For a triangle, it's k consecutive rows with 2*i - 1 '1's, centered in one column.

So, for k=3:

Row a: 2*1 -1 = 1 '1'

Row b: 2*2 -1 = 3 '1's

Row c: 2*3 -1 = 5 '1's

All centered in the same column.

So, in the grid, these '1's should be aligned in a column, with the number of '1's in each row increasing by 2 each time.

Similarly, an upside-down triangle would have rows with decreasing number of '1's by 2 each time.

So, for an upside-down triangle with k=3:

Row a: 5 '1's

Row b: 3 '1's

Row c: 1 '1'

Again, centered in one column.

Now, the code simply checks the number of '1's in each row:

- If a row has exactly one '1', it sets a to 'TRIANGLE'

- If a row has more than one '1', it sets b to 'SQUARE'

Then, if a is set, it prints 'TRIANGLE', else it prints 'SQUARE'.

Is this sufficient?

Wait, in the example above where n=3 and all rows have 3 '1's, it correctly identifies it as a square.

Another example:

n=4

Row 1: 0000

Row 2: 0100

Row 3: 1110

Row 4: 1110

Here, rows with '1's have 1 '1' and 3 '1's.

According to the code, row 2 has 1 '1', so a='TRIANGLE', row 3 and 4 have more than one '1', so b='SQUARE'. Since a is set, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

But visually, this seems like a triangle.

Wait, but according to the problem, the triangle must have consecutive rows with increasing or decreasing number of '1's, centered in one column.

In this case, row 2 has 1 '1', row 3 has 3 '1's, row 4 has 3 '1's. This doesn't form a proper triangle as per the definition because the number of '1's shouldn't remain the same in consecutive rows for a triangle.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "k consecutive rows, where the i-th row has 2*i -1 '1's". So, for k=2, rows would have 1 and 3 '1's. For k=3, rows would have 1,3,5 '1's, and so on.

So, in the above example, rows 2,3,4 have 1,3,3 '1's. This doesn't match the triangle definition because row 3 and 4 both have 3 '1's, which violates the 2*i -1 pattern.

But according to the code, since there's a row with 1 '1', it sets a='TRIANGLE', and since there are rows with more than one '1', b='SQUARE', and since a is set, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

But in reality, this doesn't match the triangle definition, so the code might be incorrect in this case.

Wait, but the problem states that the grid contains exactly one shape, either a square or a triangle, and it's guaranteed that the shape size is greater than 1.

So, in this case, if the '1's don't form a proper triangle or square, but according to the code, it's printing 'TRIANGLE' based on the presence of a row with a single '1'.

This seems flawed because the shape might not actually be a triangle.

Wait, but according to the problem's guarantee, the grid contains exactly one shape, either a square or a triangle, and it's guaranteed that the size is greater than 1.

So, I don't need to handle cases where the shape is invalid; I just need to determine whether it's a square or a triangle based on the given definition.

Given that, perhaps the code's logic is sufficient.

Another way to look at it is:

- If any row has exactly one '1', it's a triangle.

- If all rows with '1's have more than one '1', it's a square.

This seems to be the logic implemented.

But in the earlier example, where rows have 1,3,3 '1's, it's identified as a triangle, but according to the definition, it's not a proper triangle.

Wait, but perhaps in the problem's context, as long as there's at least one row with exactly one '1', it's considered a triangle.

And if all rows with '1's have more than one '1', it's a square.

Given that, the code seems correct.

Looking back at the problem statement:

- A triangle is defined as k consecutive rows with 2*i -1 '1's, centered in one column.

- A square is defined as k consecutive rows with k '1's, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

Given that, in practice, a triangle will have at least one row with exactly one '1' (when i=1), and a square will have multiple rows with the same number of '1's.

So, if any row has exactly one '1', it must be a triangle.

And if all rows with '1's have more than one '1', it must be a square.

This seems to hold true for the given examples.

Therefore, the code's logic appears to be correct.

Hence, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
