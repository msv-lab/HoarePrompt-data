Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck of 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. So, there are two cards for each integer.

In the beginning, the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, one by one, for a total of 2n turns. I go first, then Nene, and so on, alternating turns.

On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand and places it on the table. If there's already a card with the same number on the table, the player gets a point. Otherwise, they get no points.

Nene is really smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

Okay, let's try to understand this step by step.

First, I need to know what cards I have and what cards Nene has. But I only know my cards; Nene's cards are unknown to me. Wait, no, the problem says that the cards are already distributed, and I know what cards I have. So, I know my cards, and I can infer what cards Nene has based on what I have.

Wait, no. Actually, the problem says: "the description of test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, …, an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) — the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1, a2, …, an at most 2 times."

So, I have n cards, each with an integer from 1 to n, and each integer appears at most twice in my hand. Since there are 2n cards in total, and each integer appears exactly twice in the entire deck, that means that for each integer that appears once in my hand, Nene has the other one, and for integers that appear twice in my hand, Nene has none of those.

Wait, no. If each integer appears exactly twice in the entire deck, and I have some of them, then Nene has the remaining ones.

Let me formalize this.

Let S be the set of integers on my cards. So, S = {a1, a2, ..., an}.

For each integer x from 1 to n:

- If x appears once in my hand, then Nene has one card with x.

- If x appears twice in my hand, then Nene has zero cards with x.

- If x doesn't appear in my hand, then Nene has two cards with x.

Wait, but the problem says "each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most twice." So, for each x from 1 to n:

- If x appears twice in my hand, then Nene has zero cards with x.

- If x appears once in my hand, then Nene has one card with x.

- If x appears zero times in my hand, then Nene has two cards with x.

But, since the total number of cards is 2n, and I have n cards, Nene also has n cards.

Okay, now, the game proceeds with me and Nene taking turns, me starting, each selecting one card from our hands per turn, and placing it on the table. If there's already a card with the same number on the table, the player gets a point.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to find the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally.

This seems like a game theory problem where both players are playing optimally, and I need to find the outcome.

Let me try to think about how the game progresses.

First, I need to consider the state of the game at each turn, which includes:

- The cards that have been played so far.

- The cards that are still in each player's hand.

But tracking the entire state seems too complex, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way to model this.

Let me think about the properties of the game.

Each integer can appear at most twice in the entire deck, once or twice in my hand, and the rest in Nene's hand.

Wait, for each integer x:

- If x appears twice in my hand, then Nene has none.

- If x appears once in my hand, Nene has one.

- If x appears zero times in my hand, Nene has two.

In terms of scoring:

- A player gets a point if they play a card with a number that's already on the table.

So, to maximize my points, I want to play cards that have already been played, preferably ones that I have multiple of.

But I have to consider Nene's moves as well, since she's playing optimally against me.

Let me consider some small examples to get an intuition.

Example 1 from the problem:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

As per the explanation, the game can proceed as:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 1 and get a point (since 1 is already on the table)

4. Nene plays 4 and gets a point

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 2 and gets a point

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 3 and gets a point

So, I get 1 point, Nene gets 3 points.

Is there a better way for me to play?

Let me try different sequences.

Suppose I play 2 first:

1. I play 2

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 1

4. Nene plays 4 and gets a point

5. I play 1 and get a point

6. Nene plays 3

7. I play 3 and get a point

8. Nene plays nothing, but she has no more cards.

Wait, Nene has cards 4,4,2,3.

Wait, no, Nene has 2,3,4,4.

So, in this sequence:

1. I play 2

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 1

4. Nene plays 4 and gets a point

5. I play 1 and get a point

6. Nene plays 3

7. I play 3 and get a point

So, I get 2 points, Nene gets 1 point.

Wait, but according to the problem, in the first test case, the answer is 1, meaning I can get at most 1 point.

But in this sequence, I got 2 points.

Is this possible?

Wait, maybe Nene wouldn't play suboptimally in step 2. She should play optimally to maximize her score.

In step 2, Nene should play a card that maximizes her points.

If I played 2 in step 1, and Nene has 2,3,4,4.

She can play 2,3, or 4.

If she plays 2:

1. I play 2

2. Nene plays 2 and gets a point

3. I play 1

4. Nene plays 4

5. I play 1 and get a point

6. Nene plays 4 and gets a point

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 3 and gets a point

So, I get 1 point, Nene gets 3 points.

If she plays 3:

1. I play 2

2. Nene plays 3

3. I play 1

4. Nene plays 4

5. I play 1 and get a point

6. Nene plays 4 and gets a point

7. I play 3 and get a point

8. Nene plays 2 and gets a point

So, I get 2 points, Nene gets 2 points.

But Nene would prefer to maximize her points, so she would choose to play 2 in step 2 to get a point.

Wait, but in the second scenario, she gets 2 points instead of 3.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the second scenario:

1. I play 2

2. Nene plays 3

3. I play 1

4. Nene plays 4

5. I play 1 and get a point

6. Nene plays 4 and gets a point

7. I play 3 and get a point

8. Nene plays 2 and gets a point

So, I have 2 points, Nene has 2 points.

But if Nene plays 2 in step 2:

1. I play 2

2. Nene plays 2 and gets a point

3. I play 1

4. Nene plays 4

5. I play 1 and get a point

6. Nene plays 4 and gets a point

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 3 and gets a point

So, I have 1 point, Nene has 3 points.

Comparing the two, Nene can choose to play 2 in step 2 to maximize her points.

Hence, in the first test case, I can get at most 1 point.

So, the answer is 1.

Hence, the initial sequence provided in the note is one where I get 1 point, and it's the maximum I can get.

Okay, so in this example, I see that Nene's choice affects my score.

I need a way to model this for general n.

Let me think about the structure of the game.

Each integer can have 0,1, or 2 cards in my hand.

- If I have 2 cards of the same integer, Nene has none.

- If I have 1 card of an integer, Nene has one.

- If I have 0 cards of an integer, Nene has two.

My goal is to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing to maximize her points and minimize mine.

I need to find a strategy that, given Nene's optimal play, maximizes my points.

This sounds like a zero-sum game, and perhaps I can model it as such.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of pairs.

Wait, for each integer, if I have two cards, that's a pair, and Nene has none.

If I have one card, Nene has one card.

If I have zero cards, Nene has two cards.

In terms of scoring, a player gets a point if they play a card that's already on the table.

So, to get a point, a player needs to play a second card of a number that's already been played.

Hence, pairs can be useful.

But since Nene is playing optimally against me, I need to consider how she responds to my moves.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Identify the numbers that I have two cards of. These are my pairs.

- For each pair, I can potentially get one point by playing the second card after the first one is played.

- However, Nene can interfere by playing a card of the same number before I play the second one.

But wait, if I have two cards of the same number, Nene has none, so she can't play a card of that number.

Hence, for the numbers that I have two cards, I can always play them in such a way that I get a point from the second one.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no.

If I have two cards of the same number, Nene has none.

So, when I play the first card of that number, there's no card on the table with that number, so I get no point.

Then, when I play the second card of that number, there is already one on the table, so I get a point.

Hence, for each pair that I have, I can get one point, provided that I play the two cards in sequence.

But Nene can interfere by playing her cards in between.

Wait, but Nene doesn't have any cards of the numbers that I have two of, so she can't play a card of that number.

Hence, if I have two cards of a number, I can play them in such a way that I get one point from the second card.

Hence, the number of pairs that I have corresponds to the number of points I can get.

But in the first example, I have two 1's, but I could only get one point.

Wait, but in that example, I have two 1's, and Nene has none.

So, I can play the first 1, no point, then play the second 1 and get a point.

Hence, one point from the pair of 1's.

Similarly, for the numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, I can't guarantee getting a point from them, because Nene can play her card before I play mine, and get a point instead.

Hence, for the numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, it's a contest between me and Nene.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Hence, for these numbers, I need to consider how Nene will play.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as follows:

- For each number, if I have two cards, I can get one point.

- For each number where I have one card and Nene has one card, it's a contest.

- In the contest, Nene will try to either get a point herself or prevent me from getting a point.

I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that for numbers where I have two cards, I can get one point.

For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, it's a contest.

In the contest, Nene will try to play her card in such a way that she gets a point or prevents me from getting a point.

Given that, perhaps for each contest, I can get a point only if Nene doesn't play her card before I play mine.

But Nene will play optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Hence, in the contest, Nene will play her card before I play mine, to either get a point herself or prevent me from getting a point.

Hence, in the contest, I can't get a point.

Hence, the total points I can get are equal to the number of pairs that I have.

Wait, but in the first example, I have one pair (two 1's), and I can get one point, which matches the sample output.

In the third example, n=8, my cards are 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

So, frequencies: 4 appears twice, others appear once.

Hence, I have one pair (4's), so I can get one point.

But the sample output is 1, which matches.

In the second example, n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

Frequencies: 8 appears twice, 5 appears twice, 4 appears once, 1 appears once, 2 appears once, 7 appears once.

Hence, I have two pairs (8 and 5), so I can get two points.

Sample output is 2, which matches.

In the third example, n=8, my cards are 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

As above, one pair (4's), output is 1.

In the fourth example, n=3, my cards are 1,2,3.

No pairs, output is 0.

In the fifth example, n=1, my cards are 1 (assuming one 1, but since there are two 1's in the deck, Nene has the other one).

Hence, no pairs, output is 0.

Hence, it seems that the number of pairs that I have corresponds to the number of points I can get.

Hence, the solution is to count the number of integers that appear exactly twice in my hand, as those are the pairs that I can use to get points.

Wait, but in the first example, I have two 1's, which is a pair, and I get one point.

Similarly, in the second example, I have two 8's and two 5's, which are two pairs, and I get two points.

In the third example, I have two 4's, which is one pair, and I get one point.

In the fourth and fifth examples, I have no pairs, and I get zero points.

Hence, it seems that the number of pairs that I have corresponds to the number of points I can get.

But wait, in the first example, I have two 1's, which is a pair, and I get one point.

But in the sequence where I play 2 first, and Nene plays 3, then I play 1, then Nene plays 4, then I play 1 and get a point, then Nene plays 4 and gets a point, then I play 3 and get a point, then Nene plays 2 and gets a point.

In this sequence, I get two points.

But according to this approach, I should only get one point from the pair of 1's.

Hence, there must be something wrong with this approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for pairs, I can get one point per pair, but for the contest numbers, I might get some points depending on Nene's play.

But in the first example, I have one pair, and I can get one point, but in some sequences, I can get more points.

However, according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Hence, in the first example, Nene will play in such a way that I get only one point.

Hence, the maximum I can get is one point.

Hence, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, and for the contest numbers, I can't get any points.

Hence, the answer is the number of pairs I have.

But in the sequence where I play 2 first, and Nene plays 3, then I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 1 and get a point, Nene plays 4 and gets a point, I play 3 and get a point, Nene plays 2 and gets a point.

In this sequence, I get two points.

But according to this approach, I should only get one point from the pair of 1's.

Hence, perhaps there is more to it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for the contest numbers, if Nene plays her card before I play mine, she gets a point, and I don't get a point.

But in the above sequence, I got two points, which includes one point from the pair of 1's and one point from playing 3 after Nene plays 3.

Wait, no, in that sequence, I play 3, and Nene plays 3, but I play 3 after Nene plays 3, so I get a point.

But in that case, Nene could have played 2 instead of 3, to prevent me from getting that point.

Hence, perhaps in optimal play, Nene would choose to play in a way that minimizes my points.

Hence, in the first example, I can get at most one point, from the pair of 1's.

Hence, perhaps the answer is indeed the number of pairs I have.

Let me check the other examples.

Second example: n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

Pairs: two 8's and two 5's.

Hence, two pairs, so I can get two points.

Sample output is 2.

Third example: n=8, my cards are 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

Pairs: two 4's.

Hence, one pair, output is 1.

Fourth example: n=3, my cards are 1,2,3.

No pairs, output is 0.

Fifth example: n=1, my cards are 1.

Assuming n=1, so two cards in the deck, both 1's.

If I have one 1, then Nene has the other 1.

Hence, no pairs, output is 0.

Hence, in all the sample inputs, the output matches the number of pairs I have.

Hence, perhaps the answer is the number of pairs I have.

But in the first example, I could get two points in a certain sequence, but according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Hence, in that case, she would prevent me from getting more than one point.

Hence, the answer is the number of pairs I have.

Hence, to solve the problem, I need to count the number of integers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

Wait, but in the first example, I have two 1's, which is a pair, and I get one point.

Hence, the answer is the number of pairs.

Hence, in the program provided, it seems to be counting something related to the frequency of elements.

Let's look at the program:

def func():

for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:

elements = line.split()

print(sum((elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements})))

Wait, this is reading every second line starting from the third line, which seems incorrect.

Wait, the input format is:

- First line: number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- First line: n

- Second line: n integers, my cards.

Hence, the program is reading, for each test case, the line with my cards, splitting it into elements, and then for each unique element, counting how many times it appears in the list and dividing by 3, then summing these up.

Wait, this seems off.

Wait, in the first example, n=4, my cards: 1 1 2 3

So, elements = ['1', '1', '2', '3']

Unique elements: {'1','2','3'}

For '1', elements.count('1') = 2, 2 // 3 = 0

For '2', elements.count('2') = 1, 1 // 3 = 0

For '3', elements.count('3') = 1, 1 // 3 = 0

Sum = 0

But the sample output is 1, not 0.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Wait, the program is sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements})

In the first example, for '1', count=2, 2//3=0

For '2', count=1, 1//3=0

For '3', count=1, 1//3=0

Sum is 0, but sample output is 1.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the author intended to count the number of elements that appear exactly twice.

But in that case, for the first example, '1' appears twice, so the number of pairs is 1, which matches the sample output.

But the program is sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements})

Which in this case would be (2//3) + (1//3) + (1//3) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, but the sample output is 1.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be elements.count(item) == 2.

But in the program, it's elements.count(item) // 3.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points you can get in a card game against Nene, given optimal play from both sides.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - You and Nene have cards with integers from 1 to n.
   - Each integer appears exactly twice in the entire deck.
   - You need to maximize your points by strategically playing your cards, considering Nene's optimal counterplay.

2. **Insight**:
   - For integers where you have two cards, Nene has none. You can always get one point from such pairs.
   - For integers where you have one card and Nene has one, Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The maximum points you can get are equal to the number of integers for which you have two cards (pairs).
   - This is because Nene will prevent you from getting points from the integers where you have only one card.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Count the frequency of each integer in your hand.
   - Count how many integers appear exactly twice in your hand. This count is the number of pairs you have.
   - The number of pairs corresponds to the maximum points you can achieve.

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(data[2*i + 1])
        a = data[2*i + 2].split()
        freq = {}
        for num in a:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        pairs = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count == 2)
        print(pairs)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the value of n and the list of integers in your hand.

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each integer in your hand.

3. **Counting Pairs**:
   - Count how many integers appear exactly twice in your hand.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - For each test case, print the number of pairs, which represents the maximum points you can get.

This approach ensures that you are maximizing your points based on the optimal play strategy, achieving the desired result efficiently.
