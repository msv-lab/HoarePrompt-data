Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n+1. He doesn't like waiting, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue after some series of swaps. Each swap has a cost associated with it, and he wants to minimize that cost.

First, I need to understand the rules of swapping. If Kirill is at position i, he can choose any position j that is before him (j < i) and swap places with that person. The cost for this swap is a_j coins to the person at position j, and for every person between j and i (that is, for each k such that j < k < i), he has to pay b_k coins to each of them.

Kirill can perform this operation any number of times, and he wants to end up in one of the first m positions with the least possible cost.

Okay, so my task is to find the minimum cost Kirill needs to pay to reach one of the first m positions in the queue.

Let's consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to be in position 1 or 2.

Let's think about how Kirill can move forward in the queue.

Option 1: Move to position 1.

To move from position 5 (since n=4, positions are 1 to 4, Kirill is at 5) to position 1, he needs to swap with position 1, but according to the rules, he can only swap with positions before him, meaning positions 1 to i-1.

Wait, but initially, Kirill is at position n+1, which is 5 in this case. But in the code, it seems like the array indices start from 0, so a[0] is position 1, a[1] is position 2, etc.

Wait, the problem says "the n-th person", and Kirill is after the n-th person, so in the array, he's at position n, but in 0-based indexing, that would be a[n-1] being the n-th person, and Kirill is at position n.

But in the code, it's a bit confusing because the function func_1 takes n, k, a, b, where a and b are lists of length n.

Wait, in Python, lists are 0-based, so a[0] corresponds to the first person, a[1] to the second, and so on, up to a[n-1] being the n-th person.

Kirill is at position n+1, but in the code, it's handled as if he's at position n.

But in the function func_1, it seems like it's considering a[i] as the cost to swap with position i, where i ranges from 0 to n-1.

Wait, perhaps I need to map the positions correctly.

Let me try to rephrase:

- Position 1: a[0], b[0]

- Position 2: a[1], b[1]

- ...

- Position n: a[n-1], b[n-1]

- Kirill is at position n+1, which isn't explicitly in the array, but his initial position is considered after a[n-1].

He wants to be in one of the first m positions, meaning positions 1 to m.

To do this, he can perform swaps with people ahead of him, i.e., people in positions j < i, where i is his current position.

Each swap from position i to position j (j < i) costs a_j plus the sum of b_k for all k between j and i (j < k < i).

Kirill can perform this operation any number of times, and he wants the minimum cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

Now, looking at the code provided:

def func_1(n, k, a, b):

c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]

suff = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]

ans = float('inf')

for i in range(k):

ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])

print(ans)

So, it defines c as the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for each i from 0 to n-1.

Then, it computes a suffix sum array suff, where suff[i] is the sum of c[j] for j from i+1 to n-1.

Then, it iterates over the first k positions (from 0 to k-1), and for each i in this range, it calculates a[i] + suff[i+1], and takes the minimum of these values as the answer.

I need to verify if this approach correctly solves the problem.

Let's think about what this code is doing.

First, c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

Then, suff[i] is the sum of c[j] from j=i+1 to n-1.

Then, for each target position i from 0 to k-1, it calculates a[i] + suff[i+1], and takes the minimum of these.

Wait, why a[i] + suff[i+1]?

Let's see.

If Kirill wants to reach position i (1-based), he needs to swap past all the people from his current position to position i.

Wait, but in the code, i is from 0 to k-1, which corresponds to positions 1 to k.

He needs to calculate the cost to move from position n+1 to position i+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to map the positions correctly.

In the code, i ranges from 0 to k-1, corresponding to positions 1 to k.

For each such i, it calculates a[i] + suff[i+1].

What does a[i] represent? It's the cost to swap with position i.

But according to the problem, when swapping from position i to position j, the cost is a_j plus the sum of b_k for j < k < i.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the code is considering a certain optimization.

Let me consider the example:

n=4, k=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

c = [min(7,4), min(3,3), min(6,8), min(9,5)] = [4,3,6,5]

suff = [4+3+6+5=18, 3+6+5=14, 6+5=11, 5=5, 0]

Then, for i in range(k=2):

i=0: a[0]=7 + suff[1]=14 → 21

i=1: a[1]=3 + suff[2]=11 → 14

So, ans = min(21,14) = 14, which matches the first output in the example.

Another example:

6 2

a = [6,9,7,1,8,3]

b = [5,8,8,1,4,1]

c = [5,8,7,1,4,1]

suff = [5+8+7+1+4+1=26, 8+7+1+4+1=21, 7+1+4+1=13, 1+4+1=6, 4+1=5, 1=1, 0]

Then, for i in range(2):

i=0: a[0]=6 + suff[1]=21 → 27

i=1: a[1]=9 + suff[2]=13 → 22

ans = min(27,22) = 22, which matches the second output.

Another example:

7 7

a = [7,2,9,2,6,5,9]

b = [9,1,10,7,1,4,9]

c = [7,1,9,2,1,4,9]

suff = [7+1+9+2+1+4+9=33, 1+9+2+1+4+9=26, 9+2+1+4+9=25, 2+1+4+9=16, 1+4+9=14, 4+9=13, 9=9, 0]

Then, for i in range(7):

i=0: a[0]=7 + suff[1]=26 → 33

i=1: a[1]=2 + suff[2]=25 → 27

i=2: a[2]=9 + suff[3]=16 → 25

i=3: a[3]=2 + suff[4]=14 → 16

i=4: a[4]=6 + suff[5]=13 → 19

i=5: a[5]=5 + suff[6]=9 → 14

i=6: a[6]=9 + suff[7]=0 → 9

ans = min(33,27,25,16,19,14,9) = 9, matches the third output.

Last example:

2 1

a = [2,3]

b = [1,1]

c = [1,1]

suff = [1+1=2, 1=1, 0]

Then, for i in range(1):

i=0: a[0]=2 + suff[1]=1 → 3, which matches the fourth output.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for the examples provided.

But I need to understand why this approach works.

Let's try to model the problem more formally.

We can model the queue as positions from 1 to n+1, with people 1 to n in positions 1 to n, and Kirill in position n+1.

Kirill wants to be in one of the first m positions.

He can perform swaps: from position i to any position j < i, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k for j < k < i.

He can perform this operation multiple times, and he wants the minimum total cost.

This sounds like a graph where positions are nodes, and there are directed edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

He wants to go from position n+1 to any position from 1 to m, with minimum total cost.

But constructing such a graph explicitly is not feasible due to the constraints (n can be up to 2e5).

So, we need a smarter way to compute the minimum cost.

Let me think about the cost to go from position n+1 to position i (1 <= i <= m).

To reach position i, Kirill can choose a sequence of swaps that moves him from n+1 to some position j1 < n+1, then to j2 < j1, and so on, until he reaches position i.

But this seems too vague. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the cost to move from position n+1 to position i directly, or through some intermediate positions, but in an optimized way.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as a shortest path problem in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where positions are nodes, and there are edges from i to j for j < i with the corresponding costs.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, we need an efficient way to compute the shortest paths.

In such cases, often there is a way to compute the shortest paths in O(n) or O(n log n) time.

Let me consider the properties of the problem.

First, the queue is a linear structure, and swaps are only allowed to positions before him, so the graph is a DAG.

In a DAG, shortest paths can be found using dynamic programming, processing nodes in topological order.

But in this case, positions are from n+1 to 1, so we can process them from n+1 down to 1.

Wait, but in the code, it's iterating from 0 to k-1, which corresponds to positions 1 to k.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Kirill starts at position n+1 and wants to reach position i (1 <= i <= m).

The cost to go directly from n+1 to i would be a_i plus the sum of b_j for i < j < n+1.

But wait, according to the problem, when swapping from i to j, j < i, the cost is a_j plus sum of b_k for j < k < i.

So, in this case, if Kirill is at position n+1 and wants to swap to position j < n+1, the cost would be a_j plus sum of b_k from k=j+1 to n.

But this seems too simplistic. Maybe I need to consider multiple swaps.

Wait, perhaps there is a way to reach position i through a series of swaps that is equivalent to swapping directly from n+1 to i with some adjusted cost.

Alternatively, maybe there is a way to compute the minimal cost to reach position i by considering all possible paths of swaps.

But this seems too time-consuming. Let's think about the code provided.

In the code, c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

Then, suff[i] is the sum of c[j] for j from i+1 to n-1.

Then, for each target position i from 0 to k-1, it computes a[i] + suff[i+1]

And takes the minimum of these values.

I need to understand why this is correct.

Let me consider what suff[i+1] represents.

suff[i+1] is the sum of c[j] for j from i+1 to n-1.

c[j] = min(a[j], b[j])

So, suff[i+1] is the sum of min(a[j], b[j]) from j=i+1 to n-1.

Now, a[i] is the cost to swap with position i.

But according to the problem, swapping from position i to j costs a_j plus sum of b_k for j < k < i.

Wait, but in the code, it's adding a[i] + suff[i+1]

This seems inconsistent with the problem's swap definition.

Maybe I need to think about the total cost Kirill needs to pay to reach position i.

Perhaps the code is considering that to reach position i, Kirill needs to pay a[i] to swap with position i, and then pay the sum of c[j] for j from i+1 to n, which is suff[i+1].

But what does c[j] = min(a[j], b[j]) represent?

Maybe c[j] represents the minimal cost to "remove" or "skip" position j.

So, if Kirill wants to move past position j, he can either:

- Swap with position j, paying a_j, or

- Pay b_j to someone between j and his current position.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's considering that to move from position n+1 to position i, Kirill needs to "bypass" all positions from i+1 to n, and pay the minimal cost for each of them, which is min(a[j], b[j]), and then pay a[i] to swap with position i.

So, the total cost would be a[i] + sum of min(a[j], b[j]) for j from i+1 to n.

This seems plausible.

But let's verify this with the first example.

n=4, k=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

c = [4,3,6,5]

suff = [4+3+6+5=18, 3+6+5=14, 6+5=11, 5=5, 0]

Then, for i=0 (position 1):

cost = a[0] + suff[1] = 7 + 14 = 21

For i=1 (position 2):

cost = a[1] + suff[2] = 3 + 11 = 14

The minimum is 14.

But is this the actual minimal cost?

Let's see.

If Kirill wants to reach position 2, he can perform swaps to go from position 5 to position 2.

Option 1: Swap directly from 5 to 2.

According to the problem, swapping from 5 to 2 would cost a_2 plus sum of b_k for k=2+1 to 5-1, which is b_3 + b_4.

So, cost = a[2] + b[3] + b[4] = 6 + 8 + 5 = 19

But according to the code, it's calculating 3 + 11 = 14, which is less than 19.

So, perhaps there is a better sequence of swaps.

Option 2: Swap from 5 to 4, then from 4 to 2.

Swap 5 to 4: cost = a[4] + sum of b_k from k=4 to 4 (since j=4, i=5) → a[4] + b[4] = 8 + 5 = 13

Then, swap 4 to 2: cost = a[2] + sum of b_k from k=2 to 4 → a[2] + b[3] + b[4] = 6 + 8 + 5 = 19

Total cost: 13 + 19 = 32, which is higher than 19.

Wait, that's worse.

Option 3: Swap from 5 to 3, then from 3 to 2.

Swap 5 to 3: a[3] + sum of b_k from k=3 to 4 → a[3] + b[3] + b[4] = 9 + 8 + 5 = 22

Then, swap 3 to 2: a[2] + sum of b_k from k=2 to 2 → a[2] + b[2] = 6 + 8 = 14

Total cost: 22 + 14 = 36, worse.

Option 4: Swap from 5 to 4, then from 4 to 3, then from 3 to 2.

Swap 5 to 4: a[4] + b[4] = 8 + 5 = 13

Swap 4 to 3: a[3] + b[3] = 9 + 8 = 17

Swap 3 to 2: a[2] + b[2] = 6 + 8 = 14

Total cost: 13 + 17 + 14 = 44, worse.

So, the minimal cost among these options is 19, but the code outputs 14, which is less than 19.

So, perhaps the code is considering a different sequence of swaps that achieves a lower cost.

But according to the problem, Kirill can perform any number of swaps, not just one.

Wait, perhaps there is a sequence of swaps that allows a lower cost.

Let's think differently.

Suppose Kirill first swaps with position 3, paying a[3] + b[3] + b[4] = 9 + 8 + 5 = 22

Then, swaps with position 1, paying a[1] + b[1] + b[2] + b[3] = 3 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 22

Total cost: 22 + 22 = 44, which is worse.

Wait, maybe swapping with position 3 first isn't the best idea.

Alternatively, maybe swap with position 4 first, paying a[4] + b[4] = 8 + 5 = 13

Then, swap with position 3, paying a[3] + b[3] = 9 + 8 = 17

Then, swap with position 2, paying a[2] + b[2] = 6 + 8 = 14

Total: 13 + 17 + 14 = 44, same as before.

Wait, maybe there's a better sequence.

Let's consider swapping directly from 5 to 1.

Cost: a[1] + sum of b_k from k=1 to 4 = a[1] + b[2] + b[3] + b[4] = 3 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 19

Which is the same as the first option.

Seems like 19 is the minimal possible, but the code outputs 14.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me check the code again.

c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]

suff = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]

ans = float('inf')

for i in range(k):

ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])

print(ans)

In the first example:

c = [4,3,6,5]

suff = [18,14,11,5,0]

Then, for i=0: a[0] + suff[1] = 7 + 14 = 21

for i=1: a[1] + suff[2] = 3 + 11 = 14

So, ans = 14

But according to my earlier calculation, the minimal cost should be 19.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let's read the problem statement again.

"he can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j. In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k."

So, when swapping from i to j, he pays a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

Wait, in the first example, positions are 1 to 4, Kirill is at position 5.

Wait, but in the code, a and b are for positions 1 to n, and Kirill is at n+1.

But in the problem, n=4, m=2, a=[7,3,6,9], b=[4,3,8,5]

So, positions 1 to 4 have a and b values, and Kirill is at position 5.

But in the code, a and b are indexed from 0 to n-1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Kirill can perform multiple swaps, each time moving to a position j < i, paying a_j + sum of b_k for j < k < i.

He can do this multiple times, starting from i=n+1, and ending with i <= m.

I need to find the minimal total cost.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem.

Let me define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from position n+1.

Then, dp[i] = a[j] + sum of b_k for j < k < n+1> for some j < i.

Wait, perhaps I need to define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from position n+1.

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a[i] + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1)

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps dp[i] = min(dp[j] + cost to swap from j to i) for all j > i.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think of it in terms of graph where positions are nodes, and there are directed edges from i to j for j < i, with cost a_j + sum of b_k from j < k < i.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from n+1 to any of the first m positions.

But constructing such a graph is not feasible due to the large n.

So, perhaps there is a way to compute dp[i] efficiently.

Let me consider that sum of b_k from j < k < i is equal to prefix_sum_b[i-1] - prefix_sum_b[j].

Where prefix_sum_b[k] is sum of b[1] to b[k].

Wait, perhaps I need to precompute prefix sums of b.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1] to b[i]

Then, sum of b_k from j < k < i = prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

Therefore, cost[i][j] = a[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

Wait, but this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to find a better way to model this.

Let me consider that Kirill starts at position n+1 and wants to reach position i, where 1 <= i <= m.

He can perform a series of swaps, each time moving to a position j < current position.

Each swap from i to j costs a_j + sum of b_k from j < k < i.

I need to find the minimal total cost to reach position i.

This sounds like a DAG shortest path problem, where positions are nodes, and edges are from i to j for j < i, with edge weights a_j + sum of b_k from j < k < i.

Given that it's a DAG (directed acyclic graph), I can compute the shortest paths using dynamic programming.

Let me try to define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from position n+1.

Then, dp[i] = min over j > i (dp[j] + a[i] + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1)

Wait, perhaps I need to think of it differently.

Wait, perhaps dp[i] should be the minimal cost to reach position i from position n+1, considering all possible paths.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that to reach position i, Kirill can come from any position j where j > i.

So, dp[i] = min over j > i (dp[j] + a[i] + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1)

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2e5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1 is prefix_b[j-1] - prefix_b[i]

So, if I precompute prefix_b, I can compute this sum quickly.

But still, iterating over all j > i is too slow.

I need to find a way to compute dp[i] efficiently.

Perhaps I can process the positions in decreasing order, from n to 1, and maintain some kind of data structure to efficiently find the minimal dp[j] + sum of b_k from i+1 to j-1 for j > i.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of sliding windows or some prefix computations.

Let me consider defining dp[i] = minimal cost to reach position i from position n+1.

Then, dp[n] = a[n] + sum of b_k from k=n to n (which is just b[n])

Wait, but position n is a[3]=9, b[3]=5

Wait, position n is a[n-1], b[n-1] in 0-based indexing.

Wait, I need to be careful with indexing.

Let me consider positions from 1 to n+1.

Define dp[i] for i from 1 to n+1, where dp[n+1] = 0 (starting position)

Then, dp[i] = min over j > i (dp[j] + a[j] + sum of b_k from k=j to i+1)

Wait, I'm getting tangled up.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform any number of swaps, each time moving to a position j < i, paying a_j + sum of b_k from j < k < i.

I need to find the minimal total cost to reach one of the first m positions.

Perhaps I can model this as choosing a subset of positions to swap through, in a way that minimizes the total cost.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the code provided again.

It computes c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

Then, suff[i] = sum of c[j] from j=i+1 to n-1

Then, for each target position i from 0 to k-1, it computes a[i] + suff[i+1], and takes the minimum.

In the first example, this gives 14, but according to my earlier calculation, the minimal cost should be 19.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Let me try to see if there's a sequence of swaps that can achieve a cost of 14.

Perhaps there is a way to interpret the code's calculation.

Let's consider that c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

So, c[i] represents the minimal cost to "skip" position i.

Then, suff[i] is the total cost to skip all positions from i+1 to n-1.

So, if Kirill wants to reach position i, he needs to pay a[i] to swap with position i, and then pay the cost to skip all positions from i+1 to n-1, which is suff[i+1].

Hence, total cost is a[i] + suff[i+1]

Then, among all possible i from 0 to k-1, he chooses the one with the minimal total cost.

In the first example, i=1 gives a[1]=3 + suff[2]=11 =14, which is the minimal.

But how can this be achieved in terms of swaps?

Let's see.

If Kirill wants to reach position 2 (i=1 in 0-based indexing), he pays a[1]=3, and then pays suff[2]=c[2] + c[3]=6+5=11

So, total cost is 3 + 11 =14

But how does this correspond to actual swaps?

Maybe it's considering that to reach position 2, he swaps with position 2, paying a[1]=3, and then "skips" positions 3 and 4 by paying c[2]=6 and c[3]=5.

So, total cost is a[1] + c[2] + c[3] =3+6+5=14

But how does this correspond to the swap operations defined in the problem?

Wait, perhaps it's modeling that Kirill first swaps with position 2, paying a[1]=3, and then somehow "bypasses" positions 3 and 4 by paying the minimal costs associated with them.

But according to the problem, when he swaps from i to j, he pays a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

So, in this case, swapping from 5 to 2 would involve paying a[1]=3 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 4, which is b[1]+b[2]+b[3}=3+8+5=16, total cost 3+16=19, which is different from 14.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence of swaps.

Perhaps Kirill can perform multiple swaps in a way that the total cost is less than swapping directly.

Let's consider another sequence.

Option: Swap from 5 to 3, paying a[2]=6 and sum of b_k from k=3 to 4, which is b[2]+b[3}=8+5=13, total 6+13=19

Then swap from 3 to 2, paying a[1]=3 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 2, which is b[1]=3, total 3+3=6

Total cost:19+6=25, which is worse.

Another option: Swap from 5 to 4, paying a[3]=9 and sum of b_k from k=4 to 4, which is b[3}=5, total 9+5=14

Then swap from 4 to 2, paying a[1]=3 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 3, which is b[1]+b[2}=3+8=11, total 3+11=14

Total cost:14+14=28, worse.

Wait, still worse than 19.

Seems like 19 is the minimal possible.

But according to the code, it's 14.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the code is considering a different interpretation of the problem.

Let me check the other examples.

Second example:

6 2

a = [6,9,7,1,8,3]

b = [5,8,8,1,4,1]

c = [5,8,7,1,4,1]

suff = [5+8+7+1+4+1=26, 8+7+1+4+1=21, 7+1+4+1=13, 1+4+1=6, 4+1=5, 1=1, 0]

Then, for i in range(2):

i=0: a[0]=6 + suff[1}=21 →27

i=1: a[1}=9 + suff[2}=13 →22

So, ans=22

But is there a sequence of swaps that achieves 22?

Option: Swap from 7 to 6, paying a[5}=3 and sum of b_k from k=6 to 6, which is b[5}=1, total 3+1=4

Then swap from 6 to 2, paying a[1}=9 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 5, which is b[1}+b[2}+b[3}+b[4}=8+8+1+4=21

Total cost:4+21=25, which is higher than 22.

Another option: Swap from 7 to 5, paying a[4}=8 and sum of b_k from k=5 to 6, which is b[4}+b[5}=4+1=5, total 8+5=13

Then swap from 5 to 2, paying a[1}=9 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 4, which is b[1}+b[2}+b[3}=8+8+1=17, total 9+17=26

Total cost:13+26=39, worse.

Another option: Swap from 7 to 4, paying a[3}=1 and sum of b_k from k=4 to 6, which is b[3}+b[4}+b[5}=1+4+1=6, total 1+6=7

Then swap from 4 to 2, paying a[1}=9 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 3, which is b[1}+b[2}=8+8=16, total 9+16=25

Total cost:7+25=32, worse.

Seems like 25 is the minimal possible, but the code outputs 22.

So, again, the code gives a lower value than what seems achievable.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a better sequence of swaps.

Let's try swapping from 7 to 5, paying a[4}=8 and sum of b_k from k=5 to 6, which is b[4}+b[5}=4+1=5, total 8+5=13

Then swap from 5 to 3, paying a[2}=7 and sum of b_k from k=3 to 4, which is b[2}+b[3}=8+1=9, total 7+9=16

Then swap from 3 to 2, paying a[1}=9 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 2, which is b[1}=8, total 9+8=17

Total cost:13+16+17=46, worse.

Seems like 25 is still better.

Wait, maybe there's another way.

Option: Swap from 7 to 6, paying a[5}=3 and sum of b_k from k=6 to 6, which is b[5}=1, total 3+1=4

Then swap from 6 to 3, paying a[2}=7 and sum of b_k from k=3 to 5, which is b[2}+b[3}+b[4}=8+1+4=13, total 7+13=20

Then swap from 3 to 2, paying a[1}=9 and sum of b_k from k=2 to 2, which is b[1}=8, total 9+8=17

Total cost:4+20+17=41, still worse.

So, perhaps 25 is the minimal possible, but the code says 22.

So, maybe the code is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the code is considering a different interpretation of the problem.

Let me check the third example:

7 7

a = [7,2,9,2,6,5,9]

b = [9,1,10,7,1,4,9]

c = [7,1,9,2,1,4,9]

suff = [7+1+9+2+1+4+9=33,1+9+2+1+4+9=26,9+2+1+4+9=25,2+1+4+9=16,1+4+9=14,4+9=13,9=9,0]

Then, for i in range(7):

i=0: a[0}=7 + suff[1}=26 →33

i=1: a[1}=2 + suff[2}=25 →27

i=2: a[2}=9 + suff[3}=16 →25

i=3: a[3}=2 + suff[4}=14 →16

i=4: a[4}=6 + suff[5}=13 →19

i=5: a[5}=5 + suff[6}=9 →14

i=6: a[6}=9 + suff[7}=0 →9

So, ans=9

Is there a sequence of swaps that achieves 9?

Option: Swap from 8 to 7, paying a[6}=9 and sum of b_k from k=7 to 7, which is b[6}=9, total 9+9=18

Then swap from 7 to 1, paying a[0}=7 and sum of b_k from k=1 to 6, which is b[0}+...+b[5}=9+1+10+7+1+4=32

Total cost:18+32=50, worse.

Another option: Swap from 8 to 7, paying a[6}=9 and b[6}=9, total 18

Swap from 7 to 4, paying a[3}=2 and sum of b_k from k=4 to 6, which is b[3}+b[4}+b[5}=7+1+4=12, total 2+12=14

Swap from 4 to 1, paying a[0}=7 and sum of b_k from k=1 to 3, which is b[0}+b[1}+b[2}=9+1+10=20, total 7+20=27

Total cost:18+14+27=59, worse.

Seems like higher than 9.

Wait, perhaps there's a direct swap from 8 to 1, paying a[0}=7 and sum of b_k from k=1 to 7, which is b[0}+...+b[6}=9+1+10+7+1+4+9=41

Total cost:7+41=48, worse.

So, how can the minimal cost be 9?

Maybe the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me check the last example:

2 1

a = [2,3]

b = [1,1]

c = [1,1]

suff = [1+1=2,1=1,0]

Then, for i in range(1):

i=0: a[0}=2 + suff[1}=1 →3

Which matches the output.

So, in this case, it's correct.

But in the previous examples, it seems to give values that are lower than what seems achievable.

Perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the code is computing the minimal cost by considering that to reach position i, Kirill pays a[i] to swap with position i, and then pays the minimal costs to skip all positions from i+1 to n, which is sum of c[j] from j=i+1 to n-1.

But according to the problem, skipping positions involves paying b_k for each position between j and i.

I need to find a way to relate c[j]=min(a[j], b[j]) to the actual costs involved in swapping.

Perhaps c[j] represents the minimal cost to remove position j from consideration.

If c[j]=min(a[j], b[j]), it means that to eliminate position j, Kirill can either pay a[j] to swap with j and accept the sum of b_k for k between j and i, or pay b[j] directly.

Wait, perhaps it's considering that to skip a position j, Kirill can either:

- Swap with j, paying a[j] + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1

- Or pay b[j] to someone else, effectively skipping j without swapping.

But according to the problem, the only operation allowed is swapping with a position j < i, paying a_j + sum of b_k from j < k < i.

There is no direct option to pay b[j] without swapping.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect in considering c[j]=min(a[j], b[j])

Wait, maybe there's a way to interpret paying b[j] as moving past position j without swapping, but according to the problem, the only operation is swapping with position j, which involves paying a_j and sum of b_k from j < k < i.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to model this problem using the minimal of a[j] and b[j], but I'm not seeing it right now.

Given that in the first example, the code gives 14, but according to my calculations, 19 is the minimal possible, which is higher, I think the code is incorrect.

However, in the last example, it gives 3, which seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct, and my understanding of the problem is wrong.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose that to reach position i, Kirill can perform a series of swaps that effectively allow him to pay less than the direct swap cost.

Perhaps there's a way to optimize the swaps to achieve a lower total cost.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform multiple swaps in a way that the sum of their costs is less than swapping directly.

But in the first example, I couldn't find such a sequence.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me consider that when Kirill swaps from i to j, he pays a_j + sum of b_k from j < k < i.

After the swap, he is now at position j, and can perform another swap from j to some position l < j, paying a_l + sum of b_k from l < k < j.

But in this process, the sum of b_k from l < k < j includes
