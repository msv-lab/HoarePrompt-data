Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a set of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

Let me think about an example to grasp this better. Take the first test case: n=1, and the numbers are 2 and 3. So, I have to choose one pair, which is (2,3), and add the minimum, which is 2, to my score. That's straightforward.

The second test case: n=2, numbers are 1,1,2,1. I need to form two pairs from these four numbers, and add the minimum of each pair to my score. One way to do it is to pair (1,1) and (2,1), adding 1 + 1 = 2 to the score. Another way could be pairing (1,2) and (1,1), which would give min(1,2)=1 and min(1,1)=1, total score 2 again. Seems like 2 is the best I can get.

The third test case: n=3, all numbers are 1. So, pairing any way will give me min=1 for each pair, total score 3.

From these examples, it seems like pairing the smallest numbers together is a good strategy because that way, the minimum in each pair is as large as possible given the constraints.

Wait, but in the second test case, I have three 1's and one 2. If I pair two 1's together, I get min=1, and then pair the remaining 1 and 2, again min=1, total 2. If I tried to pair a 1 with a 2, I get min=1, and then pair the remaining two 1's, min=1 again, total still 2. So, it seems like no matter how I pair them, I get the same score.

But is that always the case? Let me think of another example. Suppose n=2, and the numbers are 1,2,3,4. If I pair (1,2) and (3,4), score is 1 + 3 = 4. If I pair (1,3) and (2,4), score is 1 + 2 = 3. If I pair (1,4) and (2,3), score is 1 + 2 = 3. So, pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives the highest score of 4.

Wait a minute, in this case, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives a higher score than other pairings.

Let me see another example. Suppose n=3, numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6. If I pair (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), score is 1+3+5=9. If I pair (1,3), (2,4), (5,6), score is 1+2+5=8. If I pair (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), score is 1+2+3=6. So, again, pairing smallest with next smallest gives the highest score.

This seems consistent. So, the strategy is to sort the numbers in ascending order and pair them consecutively, then take the first of each pair (which is the smaller one) and sum them up.

Wait, but in the second test case, all the optimal pairings give the same score, so maybe in cases where there are duplicates, the strategy still holds.

Let me think about why this works. If I sort the numbers, the smallest numbers are grouped together. By pairing them consecutively, I ensure that the smaller numbers are paired with the next smallest possible numbers, maximizing the minimum in each pair.

Is there a mathematical justification for this? Yes, consider that to maximize the sum of minimums, I want to maximize each individual minimum in the pairs. To do that, I should pair each number with the closest possible larger number, so that the minimum is as large as possible.

Alternatively, think of it as sorting the array and then summing every other element starting from the first.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

n = int(input())

A = list(map(int, input().split()))

A.sort()

print(sum(A[::2]))

t = t - 1

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, reads 2n integers, sorts them, and sums every other element starting from the first.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, this should work.

Wait, but in Python, A[::2] means start from index 0 and take every second element.

So, if A is sorted in ascending order, A[::2] will be the smallest, then the third smallest, then the fifth smallest, and so on.

But in the pairing strategy I thought of, I pair the smallest with the next smallest, and take the smaller one, which is the smallest.

Wait, in the first pair, min(x,y) is the smallest, in the second pair, min(x,y) is the next smallest, and so on.

So, summing A[::2] should give the sum of the smallest, the third smallest, the fifth smallest, etc.

But in reality, when you pair them consecutively after sorting, the pairs are (A[0], A[1]), (A[2], A[3]), ..., and sum of mins is A[0] + A[2] + A[4] + ..., which is exactly A[::2].

So, yes, this seems correct.

Wait, but let's verify with the second test case.

Second test case: n=2, numbers are 1,1,2,1.

Sorting them: 1,1,1,2.

Pairing them as (1,1) and (1,2), sum of mins is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the expected output.

Similarly, in the third test case: n=3, all 1's. Sorting: 1,1,1,1,1,1. Pairing (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), sum of mins is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which matches the expected output.

In the first test case: n=1, numbers 2 and 3. Sorting: 2,3. Sum of A[::2] is 2, which is correct.

So, it seems to work for these cases.

Is there any case where this approach fails? Let me think.

Suppose n=2, numbers are 1,2,3,4, as I thought earlier. Sorting: 1,2,3,4. Sum of A[::2] is 1 + 3 = 4, which is the correct maximum score.

Another case: n=3, numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Sum of A[::2] is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is correct.

What if there are duplicates? Like n=2, numbers are 2,2,2,2. Sorting: 2,2,2,2. Sum of A[::2] is 2 + 2 = 4, which is correct.

What if n=1, numbers are 1,1. Sum of A[::2] is 1, which is correct.

Seems consistent.

Is there a case where pairing differently could give a higher sum?

Let me try n=2, numbers 1,3,4,5.

Pairing (1,3) and (4,5), sum is 1 + 4 = 5.

Pairing (1,4) and (3,5), sum is 1 + 3 = 4.

Pairing (1,5) and (3,4), sum is 1 + 3 = 4.

So, pairing (1,3) and (4,5) gives the highest sum of 5, which matches sum of A[::2] after sorting: 1,3,4,5 => 1 + 4 = 5.

Another case: n=3, numbers 1,3,4,5,6,7.

Sorting: 1,3,4,5,6,7.

Sum of A[::2]: 1 + 4 + 6 = 11.

Alternative pairings:

Pair (1,3), (4,5), (6,7): sum 1 + 4 + 6 = 11.

Pair (1,4), (3,5), (6,7): sum 1 + 3 + 6 = 10.

Pair (1,5), (3,4), (6,7): sum 1 + 3 + 6 = 10.

Pair (1,6), (3,5), (4,7): sum 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.

So, again, sum of A[::2] gives the maximum sum.

It seems consistent across different cases, including those with duplicates and those without.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
