Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are n integers in a sequence, each integer is at most 4. Alice and Bob play a game where Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve is the judge and removes one number at a time from the sequence, and they play multiple games with decreasing sequence lengths until the sequence is empty. Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

First, I need to understand the winning condition. The XOR of all numbers is non-zero for Alice to win. So, for Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.

Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers. So, for each step, from n numbers down to 1 number, Eve chooses which number to remove, aiming to maximize Bob's wins.

Wait, but the problem says Eve removes one number from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers, then Eve removes another number, and they play with n-2, and so on, until the sequence is empty.

So, in each step, Eve removes one number, and then Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers. Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

I need to find, for each step, whether the XOR of the current sequence is zero or not, depending on Eve's choice of which number to remove.

But, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize Bob's wins.

Given that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, or 4, and we're given the counts of each in the initial sequence.

Wait, the input is four integers p0 to p3, representing the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. Wait, no, it says p_i is the number of integers i in the sequence, but i can be from 0 to 4? Wait, no, in the problem statement, it says "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game."

So, input is four integers p1, p2, p3, p4, representing the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence.

Wait, but in the example, the input is "1 1 1 0", which likely means one 1, one 2, one 3, and zero 4s.

So, the sequence initially has one 1, one 2, one 3, and no 4s. So, the sequence is [1,2,3].

We need to find out how many times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

First, let's understand the XOR of the sequence.

XOR is associative and commutative.

So, the XOR of the sequence is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0.

So, in the initial sequence, XOR is 0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence becomes [2,3], XOR is 2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 2, sequence becomes [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins only once.

Similarly, if Eve removes 2 first, sequence becomes [1,3], XOR is 1 XOR 3 = 2, Alice wins.

Then, remove 1, sequence [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Alternatively, remove 3 first, sequence [1,2], XOR is 1 XOR 2 = 3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 1, sequence [2], XOR is 2, Alice wins.

So, in all cases, Bob wins only once.

Similarly, in the second example, "1 0 1 2", which is one 1, zero 2s, one 3, and two 4s.

So, the sequence is [1,3,4,4].

XOR is 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 3 = 2, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number.

If Eve removes one 1, sequence is [3,4,4], XOR is 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 3 XOR 0 = 3, Alice wins.

If Eve removes one 3, sequence is [1,4,4], XOR is 1 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 0 = 1, Alice wins.

If Eve removes one 4, sequence is [1,3,4], XOR is 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 6, Alice wins.

So, in this case, Bob doesn't win in the first removal.

Wait, but the output is 1, meaning Bob wins once in this case.

Wait, maybe in one of the steps Bob can win.

Wait, initially, XOR is 2, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence is [3,4,4], XOR is 3.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 3, sequence is [4,4], XOR is 0, so Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins once.

Similarly, if Eve removes 4 first, sequence is [1,3,4], XOR is 6.

Then, remove 1, sequence [3,4], XOR is 7, Alice wins.

Remove 3, sequence [1,4], XOR is 5, Alice wins.

Remove 4, sequence [1,3], XOR is 2, Alice wins.

So, only if Eve removes 1 and then 3, Bob wins once.

So, Eve can arrange to have one Bob win.

I need to generalize this.

So, for each test case, I need to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Given that Eve can choose which number to remove at each step, she wants to maximize the number of times the XOR becomes zero.

Given that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, 4, and their XOR values are:

1: 1

2: 10

3: 11

4: 100

I need to keep track of the XOR of the current sequence and see which removal leads to XOR zero.

This seems complicated, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Let's think about the properties of XOR.

The XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the number of set bits in each position is even.

Given that the numbers are small (up to 4), we can consider the binary representations:

1: 001

2: 010

3: 011

4: 100

So, in binary, each number contributes to specific bits.

To have XOR zero, the parity of each bit should be even.

So, perhaps I can model this as a system of equations modulo 2.

But that might be too slow for t=10^4 test cases.

Wait, maybe I can look at the counts of each number and see how they contribute to the overall XOR.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the frequency of each number and find a way to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

Looking at the provided program:

It reads t test cases, and for each test case, it reads four integers a0 to a3 (counts of 1,2,3,4).

Then, it initializes cnt=0.

Then, it checks if a[0]%2 == a[1]%2 == a[2]%2 ==1, and if so, cnt +=1.

Then, for each a[i], it adds floor(a[i]/2) to cnt.

Finally, it prints cnt.

Wait, in the first example, a=[1,1,1,0], so a[0]=1, a[1]=1, a[2]=1, a[3]=0.

Then, a[0]%2 ==1, a[1]%2 ==1, a[2]%2 ==1, so cnt=1.

Then, floor(1/2)=0 for each a[i], so cnt remains 1, which matches the first output.

In the second example, a=[1,0,1,2], so a[0]=1, a[1]=0, a[2]=1, a[3]=2.

a[0]%2 ==1, a[1]%2 ==0, a[2]%2 ==1, a[3]%2 ==0, so the condition is not met, so cnt=0.

Then, floor(1/2)=0, floor(0/2)=0, floor(1/2)=0, floor(2/2)=1, so cnt=1, which matches the second output.

In the third example, a=[2,2,2,0], so a[0]=2, a[1]=2, a[2]=2, a[3]=0.

a[0]%2 ==0, a[1]%2 ==0, a[2]%2 ==0, so condition not met, cnt=0.

Then, floor(2/2)=1 for each a[i], so cnt=1+1+1+0=3, which matches the third output.

Similarly, for the fourth example, a=[3,3,2,0], a[0]%2==1, a[1]%2==1, a[2]%2==0, so condition not met, cnt=0.

Then, floor(3/2)=1, floor(3/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, floor(0/2)=0, so cnt=1+1+1+0=3, which matches the fourth output.

For the fifth example, a=[0,9,9,9], a[0]%2==0, a[1]%2==1, a[2]%2==1, a[3]%2==1, condition not met, cnt=0.

Then, floor(0/2)=0, floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/2)=4, so cnt=0+4+4+4=12, which matches the fifth output.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for the given examples.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let's try to understand the logic.

First, cnt is initialized to 0.

Then, it checks if a[0]%2 == a[1]%2 == a[2]%2 ==1, and if so, cnt +=1.

Then, for each a[i], it adds floor(a[i]/2) to cnt.

So, it's adding floor(a[i]/2) for each i, which is like counting the number of pairs in each a[i].

Additionally, it checks if the counts of 1,2,3 are all odd, and if so, adds 1 to cnt.

I need to see if this corresponds to the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Let me think about the XOR of the sequence.

The XOR of the sequence is the XOR of all the numbers present.

We need to find, for different subsets of the sequence (by removing one number, then another, and so on), how many times the XOR of the subset is zero.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

Given that the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, which in binary are 001, 010, 011, 100 respectively.

So, in terms of bits, we have:

1: bit 0 set

2: bit 1 set

3: bits 0 and 1 set

4: bit 2 set

So, the XOR of the sequence depends on the parity of the number of times each bit is set.

Specifically:

- bit 0: number of 1's and 3's

- bit 1: number of 2's and 3's

- bit 2: number of 4's

So, the XOR is zero if and only if:

- the number of 1's and 3's is even

- the number of 2's and 3's is even

- the number of 4's is even

Because XOR is zero if and only if each bit position has an even number of 1's.

Wait, actually, XOR is zero if and only if each bit position has an even number of 1's.

So, for the three bit positions (since the numbers are up to 4, which is 100 in binary), we have bits 0,1,2.

Let me denote:

- c0: total number of numbers with bit 0 set (i.e., number of 1's and 3's)

- c1: total number of numbers with bit 1 set (i.e., number of 2's and 3's)

- c2: total number of numbers with bit 2 set (i.e., number of 4's)

Then, XOR is zero if and only if c0 is even, c1 is even, and c2 is even.

So, in terms of the counts:

Let a = number of 1's

b = number of 2's

c = number of 3's

d = number of 4's

Then:

c0 = a + c

c1 = b + c

c2 = d

So, XOR is zero if and only if a + c is even, b + c is even, and d is even.

Now, we need to consider subsets of the sequence obtained by removing some numbers, and count how many times the XOR of the subset is zero.

Eve wants to maximize this count.

Given that Eve can choose which number to remove at each step, she can strategically remove numbers to maximize the number of times the remaining subset has XOR zero.

This seems quite involved, but perhaps there's a smarter way to count the number of subsets with XOR zero.

Wait, but the problem is not just about counting the number of subsets with XOR zero.

It's about playing a game where Eve removes one number at a time, and at each step, Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, across all steps.

Given that Eve chooses which number to remove at each step, she can choose to remove a number that leads to a subset with XOR zero.

But it's not just about choosing one removal; it's about choosing a sequence of removals that maximizes the number of times the XOR is zero.

This seems complex, but perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute it.

Let me consider the total number of times Bob can win, i.e., the number of subsets with XOR zero, and see how Eve can maximize the number of times she can reach such a subset through her removals.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Looking back at the program, it seems to be adding floor(a[i]/2) for each i, which is like counting the number of pairs in each a[i], and additionally, if a[0], a[1], a[2] are all odd, it adds 1.

I need to see if this corresponds to the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of pairs in each count plus one if the counts of 1,2,3 are all odd.

Wait, but in the first example, a=[1,1,1,0], cnt=1 (from the condition a[0]%2==1, a[1]%2==1, a[2]%2==1), plus floor(1/2)=0 for each a[i], so cnt=1, which matches the first output.

In the second example, a=[1,0,1,2], cnt=0 (since a[1]=0 is even), plus floor(1/2)=0, floor(0/2)=0, floor(1/2)=0, floor(2/2)=1, so cnt=1, which matches the second output.

In the third example, a=[2,2,2,0], cnt=0 (since a[0]=2 even), plus floor(2/2)=1 for each a[i], so cnt=1+1+1+0=3, which matches the third output.

In the fourth example, a=[3,3,2,0], cnt=0 (since a[2]=2 is even), plus floor(3/2)=1 for each a[i], so cnt=1+1+1+0=3, which matches the fourth output.

In the fifth example, a=[0,9,9,9], cnt=0 (since a[0]=0 even), plus floor(0/2)=0, floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/2)=4, so cnt=0+4+4+4=12, which matches the fifth output.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for the given examples.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me try to think about it.

First, the condition cnt +=1 if a[0]%2 == a[1]%2 == a[2]%2 ==1.

This seems to correspond to some specific case where all counts of 1,2,3 are odd.

Perhaps this is related to the parity of the counts.

Given that XOR is zero when all bit counts are even, perhaps this condition is checking for a specific configuration where the XOR is zero.

But, in the first example, a=[1,1,1,0], which corresponds to one 1, one 2, one 3, and zero 4's.

The XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, so Bob wins initially.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence becomes [2,3], XOR=2 XOR 3=1, Alice wins.

Then, remove 2, sequence [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, sequence empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Wait, but the sequence becomes empty only after removing all numbers, but in this case, n=3, so steps are n=3, n=2, n=1, n=0.

Initially, n=3, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, n=2, XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then, remove another, n=1, XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then, remove the last one, n=0, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins twice.

But according to the program, cnt=1 (from the condition) + floor(1/2)=0 for each a[i], so cnt=1, which doesn't match my count.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the first step, n=3, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, n=2, XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then, removes another, n=1, XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then, removes the last one, n=0, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice.

But the program outputs cnt=1 for this case, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

The problem says: "Eve removes one number from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, then Alice and Bob play with n-2 numbers, and so on, until the sequence is empty."

So, in each step, Eve removes one number, and then Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers.

So, for n=3:

- Step 1: Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining [2,3], XOR=1, Alice wins.

- Step 2: Eve removes one number, say 2, remaining [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

- Step 3: Eve removes 3, remaining empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins only once in this sequence.

Similarly, in the program, cnt=1, which matches.

I must have miscounted earlier.

So, the program seems correct for this case.

Let me check another case.

Take a=[2,2,2,0], which is two 1's, two 2's, two 3's, and zero 4's.

So, n=6.

Initially, XOR=1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining [1,2,2,3,3], XOR=1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, Bob wins.

Then, remove another 1, remaining [2,2,3,3], XOR=2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

Then, remove 2, remaining [2,3,3], XOR=2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

Then, remove 2, remaining [3,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, remove 3, remaining [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, sequence empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins three times.

But according to the program, cnt=0 (since a[0]=2 even) + floor(2/2)=1 for each a[i], so cnt=1+1+1+0=3, which matches.

Another case: a=[0,9,9,9], which is zero 1's, nine 2's, nine 3's, nine 4's.

So, n=27.

Initially, XOR=2 XOR 2 XOR ... (nine times) XOR 3 XOR 3 XOR ... (nine times) XOR 4 XOR 4 XOR ... (nine times).

Since XOR is associative and commutative, and XOR of equal numbers cancels out.

Wait, 2 XOR 2 is 0, and so on.

Wait, but 2 appears nine times, which is an odd number, so XOR is 2.

Similarly, 3 appears nine times, XOR is 3.

4 appears nine times, XOR is 4.

So, total XOR is 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 7, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 2, remaining eight 2's, nine 3's, nine 4's.

XOR is 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 7, Alice wins.

Wait, no, eight 2's XOR to 0, nine 3's XOR to 3, nine 4's XOR to 4.

So, total XOR is 0 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 7, Alice wins.

Continuing this way seems tedious.

But according to the program, cnt=0 (since a[0]=0 even) + floor(9/2)=4 for each a[i], so cnt=0+4+4+4=12, which is the output.

So, it seems correct for this case as well.

I need to find a general way to see why this program works.

Looking at the program, it seems to be counting the number of pairs in each count, and adding one if the counts of 1,2,3 are all odd.

Wait, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of pairs in each count plus one if the total XOR is zero initially.

But in the first example, a=[1,1,1,0], cnt=1 (from the condition) +0+0+0=1, which matches the output.

But earlier, I thought Bob wins twice, but actually, in the sequence of removals, Bob wins only once.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times we can pair up the numbers, plus one if the total XOR is zero initially.

But I need to think more carefully.

Perhaps it's related to the number of times the XOR can be zero, which happens when the counts of bits are even.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times we can have even counts in each bit position.

Given that, perhaps it's equal to the number of subsets with XOR zero.

But counting the number of subsets with XOR zero is not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps it's equal to the number of times the XOR is zero across all possible steps.

But Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize Bob's wins.

So, Eve wants to choose removals that lead to subsets with XOR zero as often as possible.

This seems tricky.

Looking back at the program, it seems to be adding floor(a[i]/2) for each i, which is the number of pairs in each count.

Additionally, if a[0], a[1], a[2] are all odd, it adds one more.

This seems to correspond to the number of times we can have even counts in the subsets.

Wait, perhaps it's because pairing up the numbers ensures that the counts are even.

For example, for each pair of identical numbers, removing them doesn't change the XOR.

So, for each pair, we can remove them and maintain the XOR.

But since XOR is zero when all bit counts are even, pairing up numbers helps in maintaining even counts.

Hence, floor(a[i]/2) for each i gives the number of pairs in each count.

Adding these up gives the total number of times we can have even counts by removing pairs.

Additionally, if the remaining counts after removing pairs are all even, and the initial XOR is zero, then we can have one more Bob win.

Wait, in the first example, a=[1,1,1,0], floor(1/2)=0 for each, and since all a[i] are odd, cnt +=1, so cnt=1.

Similarly, in the third example, a=[2,2,2,0], floor(2/2)=1 for each, and a[0],a[1],a[2] are all even, so cnt=0 +1+1+1+0=3.

This seems consistent.

So, perhaps the logic is:

- For each count a[i], floor(a[i]/2) gives the number of pairs, which can be removed while maintaining even counts.

- Additionally, if after removing these pairs, the remaining counts are all odd for a[0],a[1],a[2], then there is one more subset with XOR zero.

Hence, cnt is the sum of floor(a[i]/2) for all i, plus one if a[0]%2 == a[1]%2 == a[2]%2 ==1.

This seems to make sense.

Therefore, the program seems to be correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See explanation}} \]
