Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n players standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. They pass a ball around the circle based on some rules, and I need to figure out who could have the ball after m throws, given some information about the directions of those throws.

First, I need to understand the setup. The players are in a circle, so the concept of distance between players makes sense in terms of clockwise and counterclockwise directions. For example, in a circle of 6 players, the clockwise distance from player 1 to player 3 is 2, and the counterclockwise distance would be 4.

The ball starts with player x, and then there are m throws. Each throw has a distance r_i and a direction c_i, which can be '0' for clockwise, '1' for counterclockwise, or '?' meaning unknown direction.

My task is to determine all possible players who could have the ball after m throws, based on the given distances and directions.

Let me think about how to model this.

Since the players are in a circle, the positions wrap around. So, if I have n players and a player throws the ball clockwise by r positions, the new position would be (current_position + r) modulo n. Similarly, throwing counterclockwise by r positions would be (current_position - r) modulo n.

But there's a catch: in modulo n, position 0 corresponds to player n, since players are numbered from 1 to n. So, I need to be careful with that mapping.

Let me consider an example to make sure I understand.

Take the first sample input:

6 3 2

Each of the three throws has r=2 and c='?'

So, starting from player 2, each throw can go either clockwise or counterclockwise by 2 positions.

Let's simulate the first throw:

From 2, clockwise by 2: 2 -> 4 -> 6

From 2, counterclockwise by 2: 2 -> 1 -> 5

So after the first throw, the ball could be with players 6 or 5.

Wait, actually, in a circle of 6:

- Clockwise from 2: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1

- Counterclockwise from 2: 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3

So, from 2, +2 clockwise: 2 -> 4

From 4, +2 clockwise: 4 -> 6

From 6, +2 clockwise: 6 -> 1 -> 3 (wait, no, +2 from 6: 6 -> 1 -> 2, but that's not right. Let's think again.

Wait, in modulo n, adding r positions clockwise: (current + r) % n

But since player n is position n, and position 0 is player n.

Wait, in Python, modulo operation with positive numbers works as expected.

So, for n=6:

- From 2, +2: (2 + 2) % 6 = 4

- From 4, +2: (4 + 2) % 6 = 0, which corresponds to player 6

- From 6, +2: (6 + 2) % 6 = 8 % 6 = 2

Wait, but player 6 is position 6, and 6 % 6 = 0, which should correspond to player 6.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify: in a circle of n players numbered 1 to n, the positions can be considered as 1, 2, 3, ..., n.

When moving clockwise by r steps from position p, the new position is (p + r - 1) % n + 1

Similarly, counterclockwise: (p - r - 1) % n + 1

Wait, maybe it's better to map player numbers to 0 to n-1 for easier modulo operations, and then map back.

Let me adjust my approach.

Let's map player 1 to 0, player 2 to 1, ..., player n to n-1.

Then, moving clockwise by r steps: (current + r) % n

Moving counterclockwise by r steps: (current - r) % n

At the end, map back to player numbers: (position + 1)

Is this a better way?

Let me try with n=6, x=2.

Map player 2 to position 1.

First throw, r=2, c='?'

So, from position 1, can go to (1 + 2) % 6 = 3, or (1 - 2) % 6 = 5

So, positions 3 and 5.

Map back to players: 3+1=4, 5+1=6

So, after first throw, possible players are 4 and 6.

Second throw, r=2, c='?'

From player 4: position 3

- Clockwise: (3 + 2) % 6 = 5

- Counterclockwise: (3 - 2) % 6 = 1

From player 6: position 5

- Clockwise: (5 + 2) % 6 = 1

- Counterclockwise: (5 - 2) % 6 = 3

So, possible positions: 1, 3, 5

Map to players: 2, 4, 6

Third throw, r=2, c='?'

From player 2: position 1

- Clockwise: (1 + 2) % 6 = 3

- Counterclockwise: (1 - 2) % 6 = 5

From player 4: position 3

- Clockwise: (3 + 2) % 6 = 5

- Counterclockwise: (3 - 2) % 6 = 1

From player 6: position 5

- Clockwise: (5 + 2) % 6 = 1

- Counterclockwise: (5 - 2) % 6 = 3

So, possible positions: 1, 3, 5

Map to players: 2, 4, 6

But according to the sample output, it's 2,4,6.

Wait, but the sample output shows:

3

2 4 6

Which matches what I just computed.

So, my mapping seems correct.

Wait, but in the code provided, it's using (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n directly on player numbers, assuming player numbers are from 1 to n.

I need to check if that works correctly.

Let's see:

In Python, (a - b) % n works correctly even if a < b.

For example, (2 - 3) % 6 = (-1) % 6 = 5, which corresponds to player 6.

Similarly, (2 + 3) % 6 = 5, which is player 6.

Wait, but in the first step, starting from player 2, r=2, c='?'

So, (2 + 2) % 6 = 4, which is player 4.

(2 - 2) % 6 = 0, which is player 6.

So, after first throw, possible players are 4 and 6.

Second throw, from 4: (4 + 2) % 6 = 0 (player 6), (4 - 2) % 6 = 2 (player 2)

From 6: (6 + 2) % 6 = 2 (player 2), (6 - 2) % 6 = 4 (player 4)

So, possible players: 2,4,6

Third throw:

From 2: (2 + 2) % 6 = 4, (2 - 2) % 6 = 0 (6)

From 4: (4 + 2) % 6 = 0 (6), (4 - 2) % 6 = 2 (2)

From 6: (6 + 2) % 6 = 2, (6 - 2) % 6 = 4

So, again, possible players: 2,4,6

Which matches the sample output.

So, the code seems to handle the modulo correctly.

But in the code, there's a line:

if 0 in ans:

ans.discard(0)

ans.add(n)

This is because, in the modulo operation, 0 corresponds to player n.

So, it's converting position 0 back to player n.

That makes sense.

Now, let's look at another sample input to verify.

Take the second sample input:

12 1 2

Throw: r=3, c='1' (counterclockwise)

So, starting from player 2, moving counterclockwise by 3.

In modulo terms: (2 - 3) % 12 = -1 % 12 = 11, which is player 11.

So, only player 11 can have the ball.

Which matches the sample output:

1

11

Good.

Another sample input:

10 7 4

Throws:

2 ?

9 1

4 ?

7 0

2 0

8 1

5 ?

I need to simulate this step by step.

Start with player 4.

First throw: r=2, c='?'

So, can go clockwise to (4 + 2) % 10 = 6 or counterclockwise to (4 - 2) % 10 = 2

So, possible players: 2,6

Second throw: r=9, c='1' (counterclockwise)

From 2: (2 - 9) % 10 = -7 % 10 = 3

From 6: (6 - 9) % 10 = -3 % 10 = 7

So, possible players: 3,7

Third throw: r=4, c='?'

From 3: can go to (3 + 4) % 10 = 7 or (3 - 4) % 10 = -1 % 10 = 9

From 7: can go to (7 + 4) % 10 = 1 or (7 - 4) % 10 = 3

So, possible players: 1,3,7,9

Fourth throw: r=7, c='0' (clockwise)

From 1: (1 + 7) % 10 = 8

From 3: (3 + 7) % 10 = 0 -> 10

From 7: (7 + 7) % 10 = 4

From 9: (9 + 7) % 10 = 6

So, possible players: 4,6,8,10

Fifth throw: r=2, c='0' (clockwise)

From 4: (4 + 2) % 10 = 6

From 6: (6 + 2) % 10 = 8

From 8: (8 + 2) % 10 = 0 -> 10

From 10: (10 + 2) % 10 = 2

So, possible players: 2,6,8,10

Sixth throw: r=8, c='1' (counterclockwise)

From 2: (2 - 8) % 10 = -6 % 10 = 4

From 6: (6 - 8) % 10 = -2 % 10 = 8

From 8: (8 - 8) % 10 = 0 -> 10

From 10: (10 - 8) % 10 = 2

So, possible players: 2,4,8,10

Seventh throw: r=5, c='?'

From 2: can go to (2 + 5) % 10 = 7 or (2 - 5) % 10 = -3 % 10 = 7

Wait, both directions lead to the same player.

Wait, (2 + 5) % 10 = 7

(2 - 5) % 10 = -3 % 10 = 7

So, only 7

From 4: (4 + 5) % 10 = 9, (4 - 5) % 10 = -1 % 10 = 9

Only 9

From 8: (8 + 5) % 10 = 13 % 10 = 3, (8 - 5) % 10 = 3

Only 3

From 10: (10 + 5) % 10 = 15 % 10 = 5, (10 - 5) % 10 = 5

Only 5

So, possible players: 3,5,7,9

Which matches the sample output:

4

3 5 7 9

Great.

Now, looking at the code, it seems to handle these cases correctly.

It initializes ans with the starting player x.

Then, for each throw, it creates a temporary set temp and adds possible new positions based on the throw's direction and distance.

Finally, it updates ans to be temp and repeats for m throws.

At the end, if 0 is in ans, it replaces it with n, as player n corresponds to position 0.

Then, it prints the number of possible players and the sorted list of those players.

This seems correct based on the simulation I just did.

Another thing to note is that the code uses sets to keep track of possible positions, which is efficient and handles duplicates automatically.

Also, using modulo operations ensures that the positions wrap around correctly in the circle.

Given that the code matches the expected output for the provided samples and my manual simulations align with the code's logic, I can conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
