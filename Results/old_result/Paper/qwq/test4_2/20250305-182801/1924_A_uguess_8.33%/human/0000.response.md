Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. The task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I need to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if s is "abcde", then "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Now, I need to generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase letters. Since there are k choices for each position in the string, and the string is of length n, the total number of possible strings is k^n. That can be a large number if n and k are big, so I need to be efficient here.

The problem says that m can be up to 1000 per test case, and the sum of m over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^6. Similarly, n can be up to 26, and k up to 26. So, I need an approach that can handle these constraints efficiently.

Let me think about how to check if a given string of length n is a subsequence of s. A straightforward way is to iterate through s and try to match the characters of the string in order. But doing this for all k^n strings would be too slow, especially since t can be up to 10^5.

I need a smarter approach. Maybe I can think about the problem differently. Instead of generating all possible strings and checking each one, perhaps I can analyze s to see if it contains all possible combinations of length n from the first k letters.

One idea is to consider the positions of each of the first k letters in s. For example, if k=2 and s="abba", then 'a' appears at positions 0 and 3, and 'b' appears at positions 1, 2, and 3.

To form a subsequence of length n, I need to choose n positions in s such that the characters at those positions match the desired string and the positions are in increasing order.

This seems complicated to check for all possible strings. Maybe I can look for the minimal set of characters needed to cover all possible strings.

Wait, another approach: if s has enough repetitions of each character, and the order allows for any sequence, then all possible strings should be subsequences.

But that's too vague. Let's consider that for a string to not be a subsequence, there must be some sequence of characters that cannot be found in order in s.

I need a way to find if there's any string of length n that cannot be formed from s as a subsequence.

Let me think about the properties of s that would ensure that all possible strings of length n are subsequences.

Suppose that for every set of n positions, the characters in s cover all possible combinations. That seems too broad.

Alternatively, think about the number of times each character appears in s. If any character appears fewer than a certain number of times, maybe some strings can't be formed.

But that doesn't seem directly applicable, because the positions matter.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent characters, and edges represent possible transitions from one character to another in s.

But that might be overcomplicating things.

Let me look at the example provided:

First test case:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

All of these are subsequences of "abba", as shown in the explanation.

Second test case:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

Here, "aa" is not a subsequence.

So, I need to find if there's any string of length n that is not a subsequence of s.

I need an efficient way to determine this.

An idea: perhaps I can find the minimal number of occurrences required for each character to form all possible strings.

But again, it's tricky.

Another thought: the problem allows multiple test cases with constraints on the sum of m and n, so I need an approach that's efficient in terms of time complexity.

Let me consider the frequency of each character in s.

If any character appears less than the required number of times to form all possible strings, then there are strings that can't be formed.

But I'm not sure about the exact calculation for the required number of times each character should appear.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times we can reset the subsequence matching.

For example, to form multiple non-overlapping subsequences, I need enough occurrences of each character.

But I'm still not getting a clear formula.

Let me consider the problem in terms of state machines.

Each possible prefix of the strings of length up to n can be considered a state.

But that would involve dynamic programming over subsets, which might be too slow.

Another idea: use the concept of sliding windows or some greedy approach to match the strings.

But I'm getting stuck on the details.

Let me look at the provided program and try to understand what it's doing.

The program reads t, the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads n, k, m, and s.

Then, it initializes cnt and cur to 0.

It iterates through each character in s, converts it to its corresponding index (0 to k-1), and checks if that character has appeared before in the current sequence.

If not, it sets the bit for that character in cur.

If cur becomes equal to (1 << k) - 1, which means all k characters have appeared at least once in some order, it increments cnt and resets cur to 0.

After processing s, it checks if cnt is greater than or equal to n. If yes, it prints "YES"; else, it prints "NO" and constructs a string that doesn't appear as a subsequence.

Wait, this seems related to counting how many full cycles of all k characters appear in s.

But I'm not sure if this directly solves the problem.

Let me think about what the problem is asking.

I need to check if every possible string of length n using the first k letters is a subsequence of s.

The provided program seems to be checking how many times all k characters appear in s in some order, and if that count is at least n, it says "YES".

But I'm not convinced this is correct.

Take the second example:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

According to the program:

- Iterate through s:

- 'a': cur = 1 (binary 001)

- 'b': cur = 3 (binary 011)

- 'b': cur remains 3

- cnt remains 0 since cur never reaches 3 (which is (1<<2)-1 = 3)

- Since cnt (0) < n (2), it should print "NO"

But in the example, it's printing "NO" and then "aa" as a missing subsequence.

So, in this case, it seems to work.

Another example:

n=1, k=2, m=1, s="a"

- 'a': cur = 1

- cnt remains 0

- "NO"

But "a" is a subsequence of "a", and "b" is not.

Wait, but according to the program, it would say "NO" and provide "b" as the missing string, which is correct.

Another test case:

n=1, k=1, m=1, s="a"

- 'a': cur = 1

- cnt = 1 (since 1 == (1<<1)-1 = 1)

- cnt >= n (1 >=1), so "YES"

Which is correct.

Another test case:

n=3, k=1, m=3, s="aaa"

- 'a': cur =1

- 'a': cur=1

- 'a': cur=1

- cnt=1 (since cur reaches 1, which is (1<<1)-1=1)

- cnt >=3 ? No, cnt=1 <3, so "NO"

But actually, "aaa" is a subsequence of "aaa", so it should be "YES".

Wait, but according to the program, it would say "NO" because cnt=1 <3.

So, it's incorrect in this case.

Hence, the program is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the logic.

Let me look again.

In the program, for each test case:

- Read n, k, m

- Read s

- Initialize cnt=0, cur=0

- For each character in s:

- Get its index cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')

- If cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0, set cur += 1 << cur_ss

- If cur == (1 << k) -1, set cnt +=1 and cur=0

- If cnt >=n, print "YES", else "NO"

- If "NO", construct a missing string

In the case where k=1, n=3, s="aaa", m=3

- Iterate through s:

- 'a': cur=1

- 'a': cur already has 1, so no change

- 'a': cur already has 1, so no change

- cnt=1 (since cur reached 1, which is (1<<1)-1=1)

- cnt=1 < n=3, so "NO"

But in reality, "aaa" is a subsequence of "aaa", so it should be "YES".

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

So, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: False}} \]
