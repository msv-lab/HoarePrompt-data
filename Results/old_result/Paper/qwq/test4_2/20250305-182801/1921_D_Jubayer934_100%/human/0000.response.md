Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a larger array of m integers. The goal is to make Vasya's array as different as possible from Petya's array, measured by the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what exactly needs to be done. We have multiple test cases, each with values n and m, where n is the number of elements in Petya's array and Vasya's array, and m is the number of elements available to Vasya to choose from for his array. The constraints are that m is at least as large as n, and the sum of m across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, which suggests that the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n log n) or better per test case.

So, for each test case, I need to:

1. Read n and m.

2. Read Petya's array of n integers.

3. Read Vasya's array of m integers.

4. Select n integers from Vasya's array (in some order) to maximize the sum of absolute differences with Petya's array.

My task is to determine if the given Python function correctly solves this problem.

Let's look at the provided code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

temp = -1

ans = []

a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]

b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]

for i in range(n):

if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):

temp = i

break

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))

if temp != -1:

for i in range(temp, n):

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))

print(sum(ans))

There are a few things to unpack here.

First, the function reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.

It reads n and m, then reads Petya's array a and Vasya's array b.

It sorts a in ascending order and b in descending order.

Then, it tries to compare for each i from 0 to n-1, whether it's better to pair a[i] with b[-(n - i)] or b[i], based on which gives a larger absolute difference.

If it finds an i where pairing with b[-(n - i)] gives a larger difference, it switches to pairing the remaining elements with b[-(n - i)].

Finally, it sums up these differences and prints the result.

Wait a minute, this seems a bit convoluted. Let's think about the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of absolute differences.

To maximize the sum of |a[i] - c[i]|, where c is a permutation of n elements chosen from Vasya's m elements, we need to choose c[i] for each a[i] such that |a[i] - c[i]| is as large as possible.

Intuitively, for each a[i], we should pair it with the largest possible c[j] if a[i] is small, or the smallest possible c[j] if a[i] is large. This is similar to matching opposite ends of sorted arrays to maximize differences.

So, one standard approach is to sort both arrays and then pair the smallest a[i] with the largest b[j], the second smallest a[i] with the second largest b[j], and so on. This way, the differences are maximized.

Wait, but looking back at the code, it sorts a in ascending order and b in descending order, which aligns with this strategy.

Then, it seems to have a condition where it checks if pairing a[i] with b[-(n - i)] gives a larger difference than pairing with b[i], and if so, switches to that pairing for the remaining elements.

However, this seems unnecessary because in the standard approach, we just pair sorted a with reversed sorted b directly.

Let me consider if there are cases where this switching logic is needed.

Suppose a is sorted ascending: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an

And b is sorted descending: b1 >= b2 >= ... >= bm

Then, the optimal pairing should be a1 with b1, a2 with b2, ..., an with bn.

But the code seems to consider an alternative pairing where for some i, it pairs a[i] with b[m - n + i] instead of b[i].

I need to verify if this alternative pairing could lead to a larger sum in some cases.

Looking at the first example in the problem:

n=4, m=6

a: 6 1 2 4 -> sorted a: 1,2,4,6

b: 3,5,1,7,2,3 -> sorted descending b: 7,5,3,3,2,1

Standard pairing: a[0]=1 with b[0]=7 -> |1-7|=6

a[1]=2 with b[1]=5 -> |2-5|=3

a[2]=4 with b[2]=3 -> |4-3|=1

a[3]=6 with b[3]=3 -> |6-3|=3

Total: 6+3+1+3=13

But in the example, the output is 16, achieved by pairing (1,5), (2,7), (4,2), (6,1):

|1-5|=4, |2-7|=5, |4-2|=2, |6-1|=5 -> total 4+5+2+5=16

So, the standard pairing gives 13, but a different pairing gives 16.

This suggests that the standard pairing may not always give the optimal result.

Hence, perhaps a more sophisticated approach is needed.

Maybe we need to consider all possible pairings and choose the one with the maximum sum.

But since n can be up to 2*10^5, we need an efficient algorithm, preferably O(n log n).

Wait, perhaps we can sort both arrays and then consider pairing the smallest a with the largest b or the smallest b, and choose whichever gives the larger difference, and similarly for other elements.

Let's think about it.

For each a[i], we have two options: pair with the largest available b or the smallest available b.

We need to choose for each a[i] which b[j] to pair with to maximize the total sum.

This sounds like a matching problem where we need to maximize the sum of differences.

I recall that in assignment problems, the Hungarian algorithm can be used, but it's too slow for this scale.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with absolute differences, maybe we can find a way to pair smallest a with largest or smallest b, depending on which gives a larger difference.

Wait, perhaps we can sort both arrays and then for each a[i], choose the b[j] that maximizes |a[i] - b[j]|, considering the choices available.

But we need to ensure that each b[j] is used only once.

This seems tricky.

Looking back at the provided code, it sorts a in ascending order and b in descending order.

Then, it iterates through i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, it compares |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| with |a[i] - b[i]|, and if the former is larger, it switches to using b[-(n - i)] for the remaining elements.

Wait, b[-(n - i)] means b[m - n + i], assuming b is indexed from 0 to m-1.

So, b[-(n - i)] is b[m - n + i].

Let's see what this means.

Given that b is sorted descending, b[0] is the largest, b[1] is the second largest, ..., b[m-1] is the smallest.

So, b[m - n + i] is somewhat in the middle, depending on n and m.

This seems arbitrary.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider the example again.

a: [1,2,4,6]

b: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Standard pairing: a[0]=1 with b[0]=7 -> 6

a[1]=2 with b[1]=5 -> 3

a[2]=4 with b[2]=3 ->1

a[3]=6 with b[3]=3 ->3

Total: 13

But the optimal pairing is:

a[0]=1 with b[1]=5 ->4

a[1]=2 with b[0]=7 ->5

a[2]=4 with b[4]=2 ->2

a[3]=6 with b[5]=1 ->5

Total: 16

So, in this case, not pairing a[i] with b[i], but rather mixing pairings, leads to a higher sum.

Is there a systematic way to achieve this?

I think we can consider the following approach:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in descending order.

- Then, for each a[i], choose to pair with either b[j] or b[k], where j and k are indices that haven't been used yet, in a way that maximizes the sum.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative approach is to consider that for each a[i], the maximum possible |a[i] - b[j]| is max(|a[i] - b_min|, |a[i] - b_max|).

But since we have to choose n elements from m, and assign them to a[i], it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps we can use a two-pointer approach.

Let's sort a in ascending order and b in descending order.

Then, have two pointers: one at the start of b (largest) and one at the end of b (smallest).

For each a[i], choose the b[j] that gives the largest |a[i] - b[j]|.

But it's not clear how to efficiently choose the best b[j] for each a[i].

Another idea: for each a[i], consider the potential differences with all b[j], and select n differences such that no two differences share the same b[j].

This sounds like selecting n elements from b to pair with a[i], maximizing the sum of |a[i] - c[i]|.

This is similar to the assignment problem, which can be solved using the Hungarian algorithm, but it's too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a faster approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort a and b in ascending order.

Then, for each a[i], the possible c[i] are the elements in b.

To maximize |a[i] - c[i]|, for each a[i], the best c[i] would be either the largest or the smallest in b, depending on a[i].

But since we have to assign distinct c[i], this becomes tricky.

Wait, perhaps we can consider the following greedy approach:

- For the smallest a[i], pair it with the largest available b[j] if it gives a larger difference, else with the smallest b[j].

- Similarly, for the largest a[i], pair it with the smallest available b[j] if it gives a larger difference, else with the largest b[j].

- Continue this process, always choosing the b[j] that maximizes |a[i] - b[j]| for the current a[i].

But I need to ensure that each b[j] is used only once.

This seems complicated.

Let's look for a better way.

I found that in some similar problems, the optimal pairing can be found by sorting a and selecting elements from b in a specific order.

Wait, perhaps we can sort a and sort b, and then decide for each a[i] whether to pair it with b[j] or b[k] in a way that maximizes the sum.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let's consider that b is sorted in descending order.

Then, the largest elements in b are at the beginning, and the smallest are at the end.

We can try to pair the smallest a[i] with the largest b[j], and the largest a[i] with the smallest b[j], if it increases the sum.

Wait, in the first example, pairing a[0]=1 with b[1]=5 gives 4, which is better than pairing with b[0]=7 giving 6.

But in that case, pairing a[1]=2 with b[0]=7 gives 5, which is better than pairing with b[2]=3 giving 1.

So, sometimes pairing with the "opposite" end gives a better result.

This suggests that a greedy approach might not suffice, and we need a more careful selection.

Perhaps we can use dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][j] as the maximum sum of differences for the first i elements of a and the first j elements of b.

But with n up to 2*10^5, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the properties of the absolute difference.

|a - b| is maximized when b is as far away from a as possible, either significantly larger or significantly smaller.

Given that, for each a[i], the best c[i] would be the largest or smallest b[j] available.

But since we have to assign n distinct c[i], we need to choose which b[j] to assign to which a[i] to maximize the sum.

This seems like we need to select a subset of b of size n and arrange them to maximize the sum of |a[i] - c[i]|.

An efficient way to do this is to sort both a and b, and then for each a[i], choose the c[i] from b that maximizes |a[i] - c[i]|, ensuring that each c[i] is unique.

But how?

Wait, perhaps we can consider the following approach:

1. Sort a in ascending order.

2. Sort b in descending order.

3. For each a[i], consider pairing with b[j], where j is from 0 to m-1, and keep track of the maximum sum without reusing b[j].

This still seems too slow.

An optimized approach is to use the fact that to maximize the sum of absolute differences, we should pair smaller a[i] with larger b[j] and larger a[i] with smaller b[j], up to certain points.

Wait, perhaps we can find a split point k, where for the first k elements of a, we pair them with the first k elements of b (largest in b), and for the remaining n - k elements of a, we pair them with the last n - k elements of b (smallest in b).

Then, we can choose the k that maximizes the sum of differences.

This seems promising.

Let's formalize this.

Sort a in ascending order: a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-1]

Sort b in descending order: b[0] >= b[1] >= ... >= b[m-1]

Then, for each possible k from 0 to n, pair:

- a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], ..., a[k-1] with b[k-1]

- a[k] with b[m - n + k], a[k+1] with b[m - n + k + 1], ..., a[n-1] with b[m - n + n - 1]

Then, compute the sum of |a[i] - b[i]| for i from 0 to k-1, and |a[i] - b[m - n + i - k]| for i from k to n-1.

Finally, choose the k that maximizes this sum.

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, we can iterate through k from 0 to n, and compute the sum for each k, then pick the maximum sum.

Given that m can be up to 2*10^5 and n up to m, this should be efficient enough.

Now, looking back at the provided code, it seems to be attempting something similar, but not exactly.

In the code:

a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]

b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]

Then, it iterates through i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, it compares |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| with |a[i] - b[i]|.

If for some i, |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| > |a[i] - b[i]|, it sets temp = i and breaks.

Then, it appends |a[i] - b[i]| for i from 0 to temp-1, and |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| for i from temp to n-1.

This seems similar to choosing a split point k = temp, and pairing a[0] to a[k-1] with b[0] to b[k-1], and a[k] to a[n-1] with b[m - n + k] to b[m - n + n - 1].

But it's not clear why it breaks at the first i where |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| > |a[i] - b[i]|.

Maybe it's an optimization to find the best k quickly.

However, this might not always give the correct result.

Let me check with an example.

Take the first example:

a: [1,2,4,6]

b: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

sorted a: [1,2,4,6]

sorted b descending: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

For k=0:

Pair a[0]=1 with b[6-4+0]=b[2]=3 -> |1-3|=2

a[1]=2 with b[3]=3 -> |2-3|=1

a[2]=4 with b[4]=2 -> |4-2|=2

a[3]=6 with b[5]=1 -> |6-1|=5

Sum: 2+1+2+5=10

For k=1:

Pair a[0]=1 with b[0]=7 -> |1-7|=6

a[1]=2 with b[3]=3 -> |2-3|=1

a[2]=4 with b[4]=2 -> |4-2|=2

a[3]=6 with b[5]=1 -> |6-1|=5

Sum: 6+1+2+5=14

For k=2:

Pair a[0]=1 with b[0]=7 -> |1-7|=6

a[1]=2 with b[1]=5 -> |2-5|=3

a[2]=4 with b[4]=2 -> |4-2|=2

a[3]=6 with b[5]=1 -> |6-1|=5

Sum: 6+3+2+5=16

For k=3:

Pair a[0]=1 with b[0]=7 -> |1-7|=6

a[1]=2 with b[1]=5 -> |2-5|=3

a[2]=4 with b[2]=3 -> |4-3|=1

a[3]=6 with b[5]=1 -> |6-1|=5

Sum: 6+3+1+5=15

For k=4:

Pair a[0]=1 with b[0]=7 -> |1-7|=6

a[1]=2 with b[1]=5 -> |2-5|=3

a[2]=4 with b[2]=3 -> |4-3|=1

a[3]=6 with b[3]=3 -> |6-3|=3

Sum: 6+3+1+3=13

So, the maximum sum is 16, achieved with k=2.

Now, see how the provided code would handle this.

It sorts a: [1,2,4,6]

sorts b descending: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Then, for i from 0 to 3:

i=0:

|1 - b[-(4 - 0)]| = |1 - b[-4]| = |1 - b[2]| = |1 - 3| = 2

|1 - b[0]| = |1 - 7| = 6

Since 2 < 6, temp remains -1

Append |1 - 7| = 6

i=1:

|2 - b[-(4 - 1)]| = |2 - b[-3]| = |2 - b[3]| = |2 - 3| =1

|2 - b[1]| = |2 - 5| = 3

Since 1 < 3, temp remains -1

Append |2 - 5| = 3

i=2:

|4 - b[-(4 - 2)]| = |4 - b[-2]| = |4 - b[4]| = |4 - 2| =2

|4 - b[2]| = |4 - 3| =1

Since 2 >1, set temp=2 and break

Then, for i from temp=2 to 3:

Append |4 - b[-(4 - 2)]| = |4 - b[4]| = |4 - 2| =2

Append |6 - b[-(4 - 3)]| = |6 - b[5]| = |6 -1|=5

Total sum: 6 + 3 + 2 + 5 =16, which matches the optimal sum.

So, in this case, it works.

Let's check another example.

Third example:

n=5, m=5

a:1,2,3,4,5

b:1,2,3,4,5

sorted a:1,2,3,4,5

sorted b descending:5,4,3,2,1

Possible pairings:

Standard pairing: a[i] with b[i]

|1-5|=4, |2-4|=2, |3-3|=0, |4-2|=2, |5-1|=4 -> sum=12

Is this the maximum?

Alternative pairing: a[0]=1 with b[0]=5 ->4

a[1]=2 with b[1]=4 ->2

a[2]=3 with b[2]=3 ->0

a[3]=4 with b[3]=2 ->2

a[4]=5 with b[4]=1 ->4

Sum:4+2+0+2+4=12

Another pairing: a[0]=1 with b[4]=1 ->0

a[1]=2 with b[3]=2 ->0

a[2]=3 with b[2]=3 ->0

a[3]=4 with b[1]=4 ->0

a[4]=5 with b[0]=5 ->0

Sum:0

So, 12 is the maximum.

Now, see what the code does.

It sorts a:1,2,3,4,5

sorts b descending:5,4,3,2,1

Then, for i from 0 to 4:

i=0:

|1 - b[-(5 - 0)]| = |1 - b[-5]| = |1 -5|=4

|1 - b[0]|=|1-5|=4

4 ==4, so temp remains -1

Append 4

i=1:

|2 - b[-(5 -1)]| = |2 - b[-4]| = |2 -4|=2

|2 - b[1]|=|2-4|=2

2 ==2, temp remains -1

Append 2

i=2:

|3 - b[-(5 -2)]| = |3 - b[-3]| = |3 -3|=0

|3 - b[2]|=|3-3|=0

0 ==0, temp remains -1

Append 0

i=3:

|4 - b[-(5 -3)]| = |4 - b[-2]| = |4 -2|=2

|4 - b[3]|=|4-2|=2

2 ==2, temp remains -1

Append 2

i=4:

|5 - b[-(5 -4)]| = |5 - b[-1]| = |5 -1|=4

|5 - b[4]|=|5-1|=4

4 ==4, temp remains -1

Sum:4+2+0+2+4=12, which is correct.

So, in this case, it also works.

Another example:

n=2, m=6

a:5,8

b:8,7,5,8,2,10

sorted a:5,8

sorted b descending:10,8,8,7,5,2

Possible pairings:

Standard: a[0]=5 with b[0]=10 ->5

a[1]=8 with b[1]=8 ->0

Sum:5+0=5

Alternative: a[0]=5 with b[0]=10 ->5

a[1]=8 with b[2]=8 ->0

Sum:5+0=5

Another: a[0]=5 with b[3]=7 ->2

a[1]=8 with b[0]=10 ->2

Sum:2+2=4

Another: a[0]=5 with b[4]=5 ->0

a[1]=8 with b[1]=8 ->0

Sum:0

Another: a[0]=5 with b[5]=2 ->3

a[1]=8 with b[0]=10 ->2

Sum:3+2=5

So, the maximum is 5.

Now, see what the code does.

sorted a:5,8

sorted b descending:10,8,8,7,5,2

For i from 0 to 1:

i=0:

|5 - b[-(2 -0)]| = |5 - b[-2]| = |5 -7|=2

|5 - b[0]|=|5-10|=5

2 <5, temp remains -1

Append 5

i=1:

|8 - b[-(2 -1)]| = |8 - b[-1]| = |8 -2|=6

|8 - b[1]|=|8-8|=0

6 >0, set temp=1 and break

Then, for i from 1 to 1:

Append |8 - b[-(2 -1)]| = |8 -2|=6

Total sum:5 +6=11, which is higher than any possible sum in my earlier calculations.

Wait, but in my earlier calculations, the maximum was 5, but the code gives 11.

Is there a mistake in my earlier calculations?

Wait, perhaps I missed a possible pairing.

Let's check:

If c is [10,2], then sum of differences is |5-10|=5 + |8-2|=6 -> total 11.

Ah, yes, that's possible.

So, the code correctly gives 11, while I mistakenly thought the maximum was 5.

So, the code is correct here.

Another example:

n=1, m=6

a:3

b:2,7,10,1,1,5

sorted a:3

sorted b descending:10,7,5,2,1,1

Then, for i=0:

|3 - b[-(1 -0)]| = |3 - b[-1]| = |3 -1|=2

|3 - b[0]|=|3-10|=7

2 <7, temp remains -1

Append 7

Sum:7, which is correct.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Another example:

n=4, m=6

a:8,10,6,4

b:3,10,6,1,8,9

sorted a:4,6,8,10

sorted b descending:10,9,8,6,3,1

Possible pairings:

Standard: a[0]=4 with b[0]=10 ->6

a[1]=6 with b[1]=9 ->3

a[2]=8 with b[2]=8 ->0

a[3]=10 with b[3]=6 ->4

Sum:6+3+0+4=13

Alternative: a[0]=4 with b[5]=1 ->3

a[1]=6 with b[4]=3 ->3

a[2]=8 with b[3]=6 ->2

a[3]=10 with b[2]=8 ->2

Sum:3+3+2+2=10

Another: a[0]=4 with b[0]=10 ->6

a[1]=6 with b[1]=9 ->3

a[2]=8 with b[4]=3 ->5

a[3]=10 with b[5]=1 ->9

Sum:6+3+5+9=23

Another: a[0]=4 with b[2]=8 ->4

a[1]=6 with b[3]=6 ->0

a[2]=8 with b[1]=9 ->1

a[3]=10 with b[0]=10 ->0

Sum:4+0+1+0=5

So, the maximum is 23.

Now, see what the code does.

sorted a:4,6,8,10

sorted b descending:10,9,8,6,3,1

For i from 0 to 3:

i=0:

|4 - b[-(4 -0)]| = |4 - b[-4]| = |4 -8|=4

|4 - b[0]|=|4-10|=6

4 <6, temp remains -1

Append 6

i=1:

|6 - b[-(4 -1)]| = |6 - b[-3]| = |6 -6|=0

|6 - b[1]|=|6-9|=3

0 <3, temp remains -1

Append 3

i=2:

|8 - b[-(4 -2)]| = |8 - b[-2]| = |8 -3|=5

|8 - b[2]|=|8-8|=0

5 >0, set temp=2 and break

Then, for i from 2 to 3:

Append |8 - b[-(4 -2)]| = |8 -3|=5

Append |10 - b[-(4 -3)]| = |10 -1|=9

Sum:6 +3 +5 +9=23, which matches the optimal sum.

So, again, the code gives the correct result.

One more example:

n=3, m=5

a:6,5,2

b:1,7,9,7,2

sorted a:2,5,6

sorted b descending:9,7,7,2,1

Possible pairings:

Standard: a[0]=2 with b[0]=9 ->7

a[1]=5 with b[1]=7 ->2

a[2]=6 with b[2]=7 ->1

Sum:7+2+1=10

Alternative: a[0]=2 with b[0]=9 ->7

a[1]=5 with b[3]=2 ->3

a[2]=6 with b[4]=1 ->5

Sum:7+3+5=15

Another: a[0]=2 with b[4]=1 ->1

a[1]=5 with b[3]=2 ->3

a[2]=6 with b[2]=7 ->1

Sum:1+3+1=5

Another: a[0]=2 with b[1]=7 ->5

a[1]=5 with b[2]=7 ->2

a[2]=6 with b[0]=9 ->3

Sum:5+2+3=10

So, the maximum is 15.

See what the code does.

sorted a:2,5,6

sorted b descending:9,7,7,2,1

For i from 0 to 2:

i=0:

|2 - b[-(3 -0)]| = |2 - b[-3]| = |2 -7|=5

|2 - b[0]|=|2-9|=7

5 <7, temp remains -1

Append 7

i=1:

|5 - b[-(3 -1)]| = |5 - b[-2]| = |5 -2|=3

|5 - b[1]|=|5-7|=2

3 >2, set temp=1 and break

Then, for i from 1 to 2:

Append |5 - b[-(3 -1)]| = |5 -2|=3

Append |6 - b[-(3 -2)]| = |6 -1|=5

Sum:7 +3 +5=15, which matches the optimal sum.

Hence, the code seems to be working correctly for these examples.

Now, let's try to understand the logic behind the code.

The code sorts a in ascending order and b in descending order.

Then, it iterates through i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, it compares |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| with |a[i] - b[i]|.

If |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| > |a[i] - b[i]|, it sets temp = i and breaks.

After that, it appends |a[i] - b[i]| for i from 0 to temp-1, and |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| for i from temp to n-1.

In the examples above, this seems to correctly identify the split point k = temp, and computes the sum accordingly.

But is this always correct?

Let me try to find a case where it might fail.

Suppose n=3, m=4

a:1,2,3

b:4,5,6,7

sorted a:1,2,3

sorted b descending:7,6,5,4

Possible pairings:

Standard: a[0]=1 with b[0]=7 ->6

a[1]=2 with b[1]=6 ->4

a[2]=3 with b[2]=5 ->2

Sum:6+4+2=12

Alternative: a[0]=1 with b[0]=7 ->6

a[1]=2 with b[3]=4 ->2

a[2]=3 with b[2]=5 ->2

Sum:6+2+2=10

Another: a[0]=1 with b[1]=6 ->5

a[1]=2 with b[2]=5 ->3

a[2]=3 with b[3]=4 ->1

Sum:5+3+1=9

Another: a[0]=1 with b[3]=4 ->3

a[1]=2 with b[2]=5 ->3

a[2]=3 with b[1]=6 ->3

Sum:3+3+3=9

So, the maximum is 12.

Now, see what the code does.

sorted a:1,2,3

sorted b descending:7,6,5,4

For i from 0 to 2:

i=0:

|1 - b[-(3 -0)]| = |1 - b[-3]| = |1 -5|=4

|1 - b[0]|=|1-7|=6

4 <6, temp remains -1

Append 6

i=1:

|2 - b[-(3 -1)]| = |2 - b[-2]| = |2 -4|=2

|2 - b[1]|=|2-6|=4

2 <4, temp remains -1

Append 4

i=2:

|3 - b[-(3 -2)]| = |3 - b[-1]| = |3 -4|=1

|3 - b[2]|=|3-5|=2

1 <2, temp remains -1

Append 2

Sum:6+4+2=12, which is correct.

Another case:

n=3, m=3

a:1,1,1

b:1,1,1

sorted a:1,1,1

sorted b descending:1,1,1

Possible pairings:

Only one pairing: a[i] with b[j] all 1's

Sum: |1-1| + |1-1| + |1-1| = 0

The code would do:

For i from 0 to 2:

i=0:

|1 - b[-(3 -0)]| = |1 - b[-3]| = |1 -1|=0

|1 - b[0]|=|1-1|=0

0 ==0, temp remains -1

Append 0

i=1:

|1 - b[-(3 -1)]| = |1 - b[-2]| = |1 -1|=0

|1 - b[1]|=|1-1|=0

0 ==0, temp remains -1

Append 0

i=2:

|1 - b[-(3 -2)]| = |1 - b[-1]| = |1 -1|=0

|1 - b[2]|=|1-1|=0

0 ==0, temp remains -1

Sum:0+0+0=0, which is correct.

Seems fine.

Another case:

n=2, m=4

a:1,2

b:3,4,5,6

sorted a:1,2

sorted b descending:6,5,4,3

Possible pairings:

Standard: a[0]=1 with b[0]=6 ->5

a[1]=2 with b[1]=5 ->3

Sum:5+3=8

Alternative: a[0]=1 with b[1]=5 ->4

a[1]=2 with b[0]=6 ->4

Sum:4+4=8

Another: a[0]=1 with b[3]=3 ->2

a[1]=2 with b[2]=4 ->2

Sum:2+2=4

So, the maximum is 8.

See what the code does.

For i from 0 to 1:

i=0:

|1 - b[-(2 -0)]| = |1 - b[-2]| = |1 -4|=3

|1 - b[0]|=|1-6|=5

3 <5, temp remains -1

Append 5

i=1:

|2 - b[-(2 -1)]| = |2 - b[-1]| = |2 -3|=1

|2 - b[1]|=|2-5|=3

1 <3, temp remains -1

Append 3

Sum:5+3=8, which is correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct.

But I need to ensure that this logic works in all cases.

Let me consider a case where the split point k is not at the beginning.

Suppose n=4, m=6

a:1,2,3,4

b:10,9,8,7,6,5

sorted a:1,2,3,4

sorted b descending:10,9,8,7,6,5

Possible pairings:

Standard: a[0]=1 with b[0]=10 ->9

a[1]=2 with b[1]=9 ->7

a[2]=3 with b[2]=8 ->5

a[3]=4 with b[3]=7 ->3

Sum:9+7+5+3=24

Alternative: a[0]=1 with b[0]=10 ->9

a[1]=2 with b[1]=9 ->7

a[2]=3 with b[4]=6 ->3

a[3]=4 with b[5]=5 ->1

Sum:9+7+3+1=20

Another: a[0]=1 with b[3]=7 ->6

a[1]=2 with b[4]=6 ->4

a[2]=3 with b[5]=5 ->2

a[3]=4 with b[2]=8 ->4

Sum:6+4+2+4=16

Another: a[0]=1 with b[5]=5 ->4

a[1]=2 with b[4]=6 ->4

a[2]=3 with b[3]=7 ->4

a[3]=4 with b[2]=8 ->4

Sum:4+4+4+4=16

So, the standard pairing gives the maximum sum of 24.

Now, see what the code does.

For i from 0 to 3:

i=0:

|1 - b[-(4 -0)]| = |1 - b[-4]| = |1 -7|=6

|1 - b[0]|=|1-10|=9

6 <9, temp remains -1

Append 9

i=1:

|2 - b[-(4 -1)]| = |2 - b[-3]| = |2 -6|=4

|2 - b[1]|=|2-9|=7

4 <7, temp remains -1

Append 7

i=2:

|3 - b[-(4 -2)]| = |3 - b[-2]| = |3 -5|=2

|3 - b[2]|=|3-8|=5

2 <5, temp remains -1

Append 5

i=3:

|4 - b[-(4 -3)]| = |4 - b[-1]| = |4 -5|=1

|4 - b[3]|=|4-7|=3

1 <3, temp remains -1

Append 3

Sum:9+7+5+3=24, which is correct.

Seems consistent.

Another case:

n=3, m=5

a:1,2,3

b:1,2,3,4,5

sorted a:1,2,3

sorted b descending:5,4,3,2,1

Possible pairings:

Standard: a[0]=1 with b[0]=5 ->4

a[1]=2 with b[1]=4 ->2

a[2]=3 with b[2]=3 ->0

Sum:4+2+0=6

Alternative: a[0]=1 with b[4]=1 ->0

a[1]=2 with b[3]=2 ->0

a[2]=3 with b[2]=3 ->0

Sum:0

Another: a[0]=1 with b[2]=3 ->2

a[1]=2 with b[1]=4 ->2

a[2]=3 with b[0]=5 ->2

Sum:2+2+2=6

So, the maximum is 6.

See what the code does.

For i from 0 to 2:

i=0:

|1 - b[-(3 -0)]| = |1 - b[-3]| = |1 -3|=2

|1 - b[0]|=|1-5|=4

2 <4, temp remains -1

Append 4

i=1:

|2 - b[-(3 -1)]| = |2 - b[-2]| = |2 -2|=0

|2 - b[1]|=|2-4|=2

0 <2, temp remains -1

Append 2

i=2:

|3 - b[-(3 -2)]| = |3 - b[-1]| = |3 -1|=2

|3 - b[2]|=|3-3|=0

2 >0, set temp=2 and break

Then, for i from 2 to 2:

Append |3 - b[-(3 -2)]| = |3 -1|=2

Sum:4 +2 +2=8, which is higher than the possible sum of 6.

Wait, but in reality, is there a pairing that gives a sum of 8?

Let's check:

If c is [5,4,1], then sum
