Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are three friends playing chess, and in each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if such a scenario isn't possible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what constitutes a valid set of games leading to these scores.

Each game can have one of two outcomes:

1. One player wins and the other loses: 2 points to the winner, 0 to the loser.

2. The game is a draw: 1 point to each player.

Given that, for any pair of players, they could have played any number of games against each other, including zero.

Since there are three players, there are three possible pairs:

- Player 1 vs Player 2

- Player 1 vs Player 3

- Player 2 vs Player 3

Each pair can have multiple games between them.

Let's denote:

- n12: number of games between Player 1 and Player 2

- n13: number of games between Player 1 and Player 3

- n23: number of games between Player 2 and Player 3

For each pair, in each game, either there is a winner and a loser, or a draw.

Let's define:

- For pair 1 vs 2:

- d12: number of draws

- w12: number of times Player 1 won

- l12: number of times Player 2 won

Similarly for other pairs.

Note that:

n12 = d12 + w12 + l12

n13 = d13 + w13 + l13

n23 = d23 + w23 + l23

Now, the total points for each player:

p1 = 2*(w12 + w13) + 1*(d12 + d13)

p2 = 2*(w23 + l12) + 1*(d12 + d23)

p3 = 2*(l13 + l23) + 1*(d13 + d23)

Our goal is, given p1, p2, p3, to find the maximum possible total draws, which is d12 + d13 + d23, or determine if no valid set of games can lead to these scores.

First, I need to check if such a set of games exists. If not, I should return -1.

To maximize the total draws, I need to maximize d12 + d13 + d23, given the constraints imposed by the points.

Let me consider the total points:

Total points = p1 + p2 + p3

In each game, regardless of outcome, the total points distributed are:

- If there is a winner and a loser: 2 points total

- If it's a draw: 2 points total (1 + 1)

So, in all cases, each game contributes exactly 2 points to the total points.

Therefore, the total number of games played, n, is:

n = (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2

But n must be an integer, so p1 + p2 + p3 must be even. If it's odd, it's impossible, and we should return -1.

So, first check:

if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:

print(-1)

else:

# proceed

This seems correct.

Now, assuming that p1 + p2 + p3 is even, I need to find a valid distribution of wins and draws that leads to the given points.

I need to maximize the total draws, d12 + d13 + d23.

To maximize draws, I should maximize the number of games that ended in a draw, while satisfying the point constraints.

Let me think about the possible ranges for d12, d13, d23.

Each d12, d13, d23 can be from 0 to n12, n13, n23 respectively.

But n12, n13, n23 are not directly given; they are determined by the number of games played between each pair.

I need to find non-negative integers n12, n13, n23, d12, d13, d23, w12, l12, w13, l23, such that:

n12 = d12 + w12 + l12

n13 = d13 + w13 + l13

n23 = d23 + w23 + l23

p1 = 2*(w12 + w13) + 1*(d12 + d13)

p2 = 2*(w23 + l12) + 1*(d12 + d23)

p3 = 2*(l13 + l23) + 1*(d13 + d23)

And I want to maximize d12 + d13 + d23.

This seems quite involved. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the total points again.

Total points = p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*(number of games) = 2*(n12 + n13 + n23)

So, n12 + n13 + n23 = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Our goal is to maximize the total draws, d12 + d13 + d23, given the above constraints.

I need to find a way to express d12, d13, d23 in terms of the points.

Alternatively, maybe I can find expressions for the number of wins and losses.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of wins for each player.

Let me define:

w1: number of games Player 1 won

w2: number of games Player 2 won

w3: number of games Player 3 won

d1: number of draws involving Player 1

d2: number of draws involving Player 2

d3: number of draws involving Player 3

Then:

p1 = 2*w1 + d1

p2 = 2*w2 + d2

p3 = 2*w3 + d3

Also, the total number of draws is (d1 + d2 + d3)/2, since each draw involves two players.

Wait, actually, each draw is counted in d1, d2, and d3 for the two players involved.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each draw game contributes 1 point to each player involved.

Each win contributes 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.

So, the total points can be expressed in terms of the number of wins and draws.

Let me denote:

Let’s define:

- Let d be the total number of draws across all games.

- Let w be the total number of wins (and hence losses, since each win corresponds to one loss).

We have:

Total points = 2*w + d

But total points = p1 + p2 + p3

Also, total games = w + d

But from above, total games = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

So, w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

And 2*w + d = p1 + p2 + p3

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

But w can't be more than the total games, which is also (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

So, w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

And d = total games - w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w = 0

Wait, that would imply that the maximum number of draws is zero, which can't be right.

That suggests I'm making a mistake in assuming that w = total games.

Wait, no, w is the number of wins, and total games is w + d.

Wait, but from the earlier equations:

w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

And 2*w + d = p1 + p2 + p3

Subtracting the first from the second:

w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Then d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w = 0

This suggests that the only solution is d = 0, which can't be right because in some cases, draws are possible.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that w is not the total number of wins, but the total number of games where there was a winner (i.e., not a draw).

Wait, no, w is the total number of wins, and each win corresponds to one game.

Each game is either a win (for one player) or a draw.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total number of wins and draws.

Let me let w be the total number of games that had a winner, and d be the total number of draws.

Then, total games = w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Total points = 2*w + d = p1 + p2 + p3

Then, from these two equations:

w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

2*w + d = p1 + p2 + p3

Subtract the first equation from the second:

w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Then d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w = 0

This again suggests d = 0, which can't be right because draws are possible.

I must be missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that w is not the total number of wins, but the number of games where one player won.

Wait, in each win, one player wins and the other loses, so w should be the number of games with a winner.

Similarly, d is the number of games that ended in a draw.

So, total games = w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Total points = 2*w + d = p1 + p2 + p3

From these, w = p1 + p2 + p3 - (w + d) = p1 + p2 + p3 - (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Thus, d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 = 0

This suggests that d must be zero, which contradicts the problem statement that draws are possible.

I must be making a mistake in assuming that w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Wait, no, according to the equations, that seems correct.

But clearly, in reality, draws are possible, so what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that w is not necessarily equal to (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Wait, let's solve the equations again.

We have:

w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

2*w + d = p1 + p2 + p3

Subtract the first equation from the second:

w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Then d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w = 0

This suggests that d must be zero, which can't be right.

But in the sample input, there are cases where draws are present.

For example, in the second test case:

0 1 1

The output is 1, meaning one draw occurred.

But according to this, d should be zero, which contradicts.

So, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that w represents only the number of games with a winner, and in that case, the total points would be 2*w + d, but with the constraints of how points are distributed among players.

Maybe I need to consider the distribution of wins and draws among the players.

Let me try to think differently.

Let’s consider that the total points are p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*(number of games)

So, number of games = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Our goal is to maximize the number of draws, which is equivalent to maximizing d, the number of draw games.

From the earlier equations:

w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

2*w + d = p1 + p2 + p3

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Then d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w = 0

This again suggests d = 0, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps there is a different way to approach this by considering the individual players' points.

Let me think about the possible ways the points can be achieved.

Given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and all p_i are integers between 0 and 30.

I need to find a way to distribute the wins and draws among the pairs to achieve these points.

Maybe I can consider the minimal number of wins required to achieve these points, and the rest can be draws.

Wait, but I need to maximize draws, so perhaps I need to minimize wins.

Wait, but according to the earlier equations, d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w

And 2*w + d = p1 + p2 + p3

So, d = p1 + p2 + p3 - 2*w

But w is the number of games with a winner, so w must be at least enough to account for the points that can't be achieved through draws.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the minimal number of wins required.

Each win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, while a draw contributes 1 point to each.

So, to maximize draws, I need to minimize the number of wins.

But from the earlier equations, w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, which seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the sum of individual points must satisfy certain conditions based on the possible pairings.

Let me consider that the sum of points is equal to twice the number of games, which is equal to the number of games played.

Wait, no, each game contributes 2 points, whether it's a win or a draw.

So, total points = 2 * number of games.

Hence, number of games = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Our goal is to maximize the number of draws, which is equivalent to maximizing d, the number of draw games.

But according to the earlier equations, d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w, and w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, which would imply d = 0.

But in reality, d can be higher.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that w is not necessarily equal to (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Wait, no, according to the equations, w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

But in the sample input, there are cases where d > 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the individual player points impose additional constraints.

Let me consider the possible point distributions.

Let’s consider that each player's points come from wins and draws in their respective games.

For example, Player 1's points come from wins against Player 2 and Player 3, and draws with them.

Similarly for the other players.

So, p1 = 2*(number of wins against Player 2 and Player 3) + 1*(number of draws with Player 2 and Player 3)

Similarly for p2 and p3.

I need to maximize the sum of draws between all pairs, i.e., d12 + d13 + d23.

Subject to:

p1 = 2*(w12 + w13) + 1*(d12 + d13)

p2 = 2*(w23 + l12) + 1*(d12 + d23)

p3 = 2*(l13 + l23) + 1*(d13 + d23)

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of wins and losses for each player.

Let me define:

For Player 1:

w1: number of wins in games involving Player 1

l1: number of losses in games involving Player 1

d1: number of draws in games involving Player 1

Similarly for Player 2 and Player 3.

Then:

p1 = 2*w1 + 1*d1

p2 = 2*w2 + 1*d2

p3 = 2*w3 + 1*d3

Also, in games between Player 1 and Player 2:

- w12: number of times Player 1 won

- l12: number of times Player 2 won

- d12: number of draws

Similarly for other pairs.

Then:

w1 = w12 + w13

w2 = w23 + l12

w3 = l13 + l23

d1 = d12 + d13

d2 = d12 + d23

d3 = d13 + d23

Our goal is to maximize d12 + d13 + d23, subject to the above equations and the constraints that all variables are non-negative integers.

This seems like a system of linear equations with integer variables.

I need to find non-negative integers w12, w13, w23, d12, d13, d23 such that:

w1 = w12 + w13

w2 = w23 + l12

w3 = l13 + l23

d1 = d12 + d13

d2 = d12 + d23

d3 = d13 + d23

And p1 = 2*w1 + d1

p2 = 2*w2 + d2

p3 = 2*w3 + d3

Our goal is to maximize d12 + d13 + d23.

This seems complicated. Maybe I can find a way to express d12, d13, d23 in terms of the p's.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find bounds on d12, d13, d23 based on the p's.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many games as possible end in a draw, while still achieving the given points.

So, to maximize draws, I need to minimize the number of wins.

Given that, I need to find the minimal number of wins required to achieve the points, and the rest can be draws.

Wait, but according to the earlier equations, w is fixed as (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, which would imply that d is zero.

But that can't be right because sample inputs show that d can be greater than zero.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that w is not necessarily equal to (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Wait, according to the equations:

w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

And 2*w + d = p1 + p2 + p3

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Then d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w = 0

This suggests that d must be zero, which contradicts the sample inputs.

I must be missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that w is not necessarily equal to (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Wait, no, according to the equations, it is.

But in the sample input, for the second test case:

0 1 1

Total points: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

Number of games: 1

Total draws: 1 (as per the sample output)

But according to the equations:

w + d = 1

2*w + d = 2

Subtracting: w = 1

Then d = 0

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the points can't be achieved with w = 1 and d = 0 in this case.

Wait, let's see:

If w = 1 and d = 0, then points would be 2*1 + 0 = 2, which matches the total points.

But how are the points distributed?

If one game is played between Player 2 and Player 3, and it's a draw, then p2 and p3 each get 1 point, matching the sample input: 0,1,1.

So in this case, d = 1, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that d = 0.

So, perhaps d can be greater than zero even if w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2.

Wait, in this case, w + d = 1, and 2*w + d = 2.

If w = 0, then d = 1, and 2*0 + 1 = 1, which doesn't match total points.

So, w must be 1, and d = 0, but the sample output shows d = 1.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps w represents only the number of games with a winner, and d the number of draws.

But in the sample input, when output is 1, it means there was one draw.

But according to the equations, if d = 1, then w = (2 - 1) = 1, but 2*1 + 1 = 3, which doesn't match total points of 2.

Wait, that can't be right.

I must be misunderstanding something fundamental here.

Let me try to think differently.

Let’s consider that in each game, if it's a draw, both players get 1 point, contributing 2 points to the total.

If there is a winner, the winner gets 2 points, and the loser gets 0, again contributing 2 points to the total.

Therefore, total points = 2 * number of games

Hence, number of games = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Our goal is to maximize the number of draws, which is the number of games that ended in a draw.

But according to the earlier equations, if w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, then d = 0

But in reality, d can be greater than zero, as shown in the sample input.

So, perhaps the equations are incomplete.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the points assigned to each player impose additional constraints.

Let’s consider that the sum of points is equal to 2 times the number of games, but also, the individual points must be achievable through some combination of wins and draws in the games they played.

So, perhaps I need to find a distribution where the points are consistent with some number of wins and draws in the games between the pairs.

Let’s consider that for each pair, the total points they have from their games should be equal to twice the number of games they played, minus the number of wins one has over the other.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many games as possible end in a draw.

To maximize draws, I need to minimize the number of wins.

Given that, I need to find the minimal number of wins required to achieve the points.

So, for each player, their points come from 2*w_i + d_i, where w_i is the number of wins for that player and d_i is the number of draws involving that player.

Given that, for each player, p_i = 2*w_i + d_i

Summing over all players:

p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*(w1 + w2 + w3) + (d1 + d2 + d3)

But d1 + d2 + d3 = 2*(number of draws), since each draw involves two players.

Let’s denote d = number of draws.

Then, d1 + d2 + d3 = 2*d

Similarly, w1 + w2 + w3 = number of wins, w.

So, p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*w + 2*d = 2*(w + d)

But total games = w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Which is consistent with earlier.

Our goal is to maximize d, the number of draws.

To maximize d, we need to minimize w.

What's the minimal number of wins required to achieve the points?

Each win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.

Each draw contributes 1 point to each player.

So, to minimize wins, we need to maximize draws, which aligns with our goal.

But we need to ensure that the points can be achieved with the given number of wins and draws.

Let’s consider that the minimal number of wins is the ceiling of (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 minus the number of draws.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate to find the minimal w that satisfies all individual p_i.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the minimal number of wins is the maximum of (p1 - d1)/2, (p2 - d2)/2, (p3 - d3)/2, but this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for each player, p_i >= d_i, since each draw contributes only 1 point.

Also, p_i must be <= 2*w_i + d_i

Wait, p_i = 2*w_i + d_i, as per earlier.

Given that, and d_i = number of draws involving player i.

Our goal is to maximize d = d12 + d13 + d23, where d12 is the number of draws between player 1 and 2, and so on.

Given that d1 = d12 + d13

d2 = d12 + d23

d3 = d13 + d23

So, d = d12 + d13 + d23 = (d1 + d2 + d3)/2

Because d1 + d2 + d3 = 2*(d12 + d13 + d23)

Wait, that's interesting.

So, d = (d1 + d2 + d3)/2

But d1 = number of draws involving player 1, which is d12 + d13

Similarly for d2 and d3.

Hence, d = d12 + d13 + d23

Which is consistent with earlier.

Now, p1 = 2*w1 + d1

p2 = 2*w2 + d2

p3 = 2*w3 + d3

Also, w1 + w2 + w3 = w

And d1 + d2 + d3 = 2*d

Our goal is to maximize d, given that w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

From p1 = 2*w1 + d1, we can express d1 = p1 - 2*w1

Similarly, d2 = p2 - 2*w2

d3 = p3 - 2*w3

Then, d = (d1 + d2 + d3)/2 = (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2*(w1 + w2 + w3))/2 = (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2*w)/2 = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w

But earlier, w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

So, d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w

Which is consistent.

Now, to maximize d, we need to minimize w.

What's the minimal possible w?

Well, w must be at least the maximum of (p1 - d1)/2, (p2 - d2)/2, (p3 - d3)/2, but since d1, d2, d3 are related, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider flow networks or something similar, but that might be too complicated for this problem.

Let me consider specific cases to see if I can find a pattern.

Case 1: p1 = p2 = p3 = 0

Total points: 0, so no games were played. Hence, draws = 0

Case 2: p1 = 0, p2 = 1, p3 = 1

Total points: 2, so one game was played.

If one game was played and it ended in a draw, p2 and p3 each get 1 point, matching the input.

Hence, draws = 1

Case 3: p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1

Total points: 3, which is odd, so invalid. But according to the sample input, output is -1, which matches.

Case 4: p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 2

Total points: 4, so two games were played.

Is it possible to have draws leading to these points?

If both games are draws, then p1, p2, p3 would each have 1 point from each draw, but that would require specifying which pairs drew.

Wait, if two games are played between different pairs, for example:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw → p1 = 1, p2 = 1

- Game 2: Player 1 vs Player 3, draw → p1 = 2, p3 = 1

But that would make p1 = 2, p2 = 1, p3 = 1, which doesn't match the input.

Wait, the input is p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 2

So, perhaps:

- Game 1: Player 2 vs Player 3, draw → p2 = 1, p3 = 1

- Game 2: Player 1 vs Player 3, draw → p1 = 1, p3 = 2

Total draws: 2, which matches the sample output.

Case 5: p1 = 3, p2 = 3, p3 = 3

Total points: 9, which is odd, so invalid. Sample output is -1.

Case 6: p1 = 3, p2 = 4, p3 = 5

Total points: 12, so 6 games were played.

Is it possible to have draws leading to these points?

Let’s see:

If all games are draws, each player gets points equal to the number of games they played.

But in this case, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps some games have winners.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, to maximize draws, you need to minimize wins, and you can set up inequalities to find the minimal number of wins required.

Given that, perhaps I can set up the problem to minimize w, and then d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w

Then, maximize d by minimizing w.

But I need to find the minimal w that satisfies all p_i = 2*w_i + d_i, with w_i <= number of games player i participated in.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal number of wins is the sum of p_i minus the maximal possible d_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that d_i <= the number of games player i participated in.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that the sum of p_i is equal to 2*w + 2*d, where w is the number of wins and d is the number of draws.

Wait, no, total points is 2*w + d, since each win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, and each draw contributes 1 point to each player.

Wait, hold on, earlier I thought that total points is 2*w + d, but actually, each draw contributes 1 point to each player, so 2 points per draw.

Hence, total points = 2*w + 2*d

Then, number of games = w + d

Hence, 2*w + 2*d = p1 + p2 + p3

And w + d = number of games

From 2*w + 2*d = p1 + p2 + p3, and w + d = number of games, these are consistent.

Wait, but then w + d = number of games = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

And 2*w + 2*d = p1 + p2 + p3

Hence, w + d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

And 2*w + 2*d = p1 + p2 + p3

These are consistent.

Now, to maximize d, I need to minimize w.

What's the minimal w required to achieve the points?

I need to ensure that for each player, p_i <= 2*w_i + d_i

But d_i = number of draws involving player i.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that the minimal w is the maximum of (p1 - d1)/2, (p2 - d2)/2, (p3 - d3)/2

But d1, d2, d3 are related through d12, d13, d23.

This seems too tangled.

Perhaps I should look for an upper bound on d.

Given that d = (d1 + d2 + d3)/2, and d_i <= p_i, since each draw contributes 1 point to a player.

Also, d_i <= number of games player i participated in.

But number of games player i participated in is sum of n12, n13, etc.

This is getting too involved.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2, since p1 <= p2 <= p3.

Wait, in the sample input, for p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, output is 2

Similarly, for p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, output is 6

Wait, 3 + 4 = 7, but output is 6, which is less than 7.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2, but in this case, p1 + p2 = 3 + 4 = 7, but output is 6.

So, maybe it's min(p1 + p2, p1 + p3, p2 + p3)

Wait, p1 + p2 = 3 + 4 =7

p1 + p3 = 3 + 5 =8

p2 + p3 =4 +5=9

But output is 6, which is less than the minimum of these, which is 7.

So, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's p1 + p2 + p3 - p3 = p1 + p2

But again, in this case, p1 + p2 =7, but output is 6.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2 if p3 <= p1 + p2, else p1 + p2 + p3 - 2*p3

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2 if p3 <= p1 + p2, else -1

But in this case, p3=5, p1 + p2=7, which is greater, so output should be p1 + p2=7, but sample output is 6.

So, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's p1 + p2 + p3 - 2*p3 = p1 + p2 - p3

But in this case, p1 + p2 - p3 =3 +4 -5=2, which doesn't match the sample output of 6.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2 + p3 - 2*max(p1, p2, p3) = p1 + p2 + p3 -2*p3 =3 +4 +5 -10=2, which again doesn't match.

This is not working.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider that the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many games as possible end in a draw, while still achieving the given points.

So, to maximize draws, I need to minimize the number of wins.

Given that, I need to find the minimal number of wins required to achieve the points.

Each win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.

Each draw contributes 1 point to each player.

So, to minimize wins, I need to maximize the points achieved through draws.

But each draw contributes 1 point to each player involved.

Given that, the maximum points that can be achieved through draws is limited by the number of draws and the players involved.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider that the sum of points is equal to 2*w + 2*d, and I need to maximize d.

Given that, d = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w

To maximize d, I need to minimize w.

What's the minimal w required?

Well, w must be at least the maximum of (p1 - d1)/2, (p2 - d2)/2, (p3 - d3)/2

But d1, d2, d3 are related through d12, d13, d23.

This seems too complicated.

Let me consider that for the minimal w, it's the sum of p_i divided by 2 minus d, but again, it's circular.

Perhaps I need to consider that the minimal w is such that w >= (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2*d)/2

But this doesn't help much.

Let me consider that p1 <= p2 <= p3

If p1 + p2 >= p3, then it's possible, and the maximum draws are p1 + p2 - p3

Wait, in sample input 4: p1=1, p2=1, p3=2

p1 + p2 =2 >= p3=2, so draws = p1 + p2 - p3 =0, but sample output is 2

So, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2

But in this case, p1 + p2 =2, but sample output is 2, which matches.

Wait, in sample input 6: p1=3, p2=4, p3=5

p1 + p2 =7, but sample output is 6

Wait, 7 - (5 -3) =5, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2 if p3 <= p1 + p2, else -1

But in sample input 5: p1=3, p2=3, p3=3

p1 + p2 =6 >= p3=3, but output is -1

So, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2 if p3 <= p1 + p2 and p1 + p2 + p3 is even, else -1

But in sample input 6: p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, p1 + p2 + p3 =12, which is even, and p3 <= p1 + p2, but output is 6, which is p1 + p2 =7, but sample output is 6

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2 - (p3 - p1 - p2 + p3)/2

Wait, that seems too convoluted.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2, but in sample input 6, p1 + p2 =7, but output is 6.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2 - x, where x is some value.

In sample input 6, x=1, but I don't know.

This is too vague.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2, but in sample input 6, p1 + p2 =7, but output is 6.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2 - floor((p3 - p1 - p2)/2)

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of wins required for p3.

If p3 > p1 + p2, then it's impossible, so -1

Otherwise, the maximum draws are p1 + p2 - p3

But in sample input 4: p1=1, p2=1, p3=2

p1 + p2 =2 >= p3=2, so draws =0, but sample output is 2

So, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2

But in sample input 5: p1=3, p2=3, p3=3

p1 + p2 =6, but it's impossible, so output is -1

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2 if p3 <= p1 + p2 and p1 + p2 + p3 is even, else -1

But in sample input 6: p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, p3=5 <= p1 + p2=7, and p1 + p2 + p3=12 is even, but output is 6, which is p1 + p2 =7, but sample output is 6

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's p1 + p2 - y, where y is the number of wins needed for p3

But I'm stuck.

Let me look at the provided code and see what it's doing.

The code is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())

if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:

print(-1)

continue

if p3 >= p1 + p2:

print(p1 + p2)

else:

x = 0

y = p3

while y >= x:

if p1 - x <= p2 - y:

print(p1 - x + p3)

break

else:

x += 1

y -= 1

else:

print(p3)

First, it checks if the sum of p1, p2, p3 is even. If not, prints -1.

Then, if p3 >= p1 + p2, prints p1 + p2

Else, it enters a loop where it tries to find x and y such that x <= y, and p1 - x <= p2 - y, then prints p1 - x + p3

If no such x and y are found, it prints p3

Wait, in sample input 4: p1=1, p2=1, p3=2

p3 =2 >= p1 + p2 =2, so it prints p1 + p2 =2, which matches sample output.

In sample input 6: p1=3, p2=4, p3=5

p3=5 < p1 + p2=7, so it enters the else clause.

It sets x=0, y=5

checks if 3 -0 <=4 -5, which is 3 <= -1, which is false

then x=1, y=4

3 -1 <=4 -4 → 2 <=0, false

x=2, y=3

3 -2 <=4 -3 →1 <=1, which is true

Then prints p1 -x + p3 =3 -2 +5=6, which matches sample output.

In sample input 5: p1=3, p2=3, p3=3

p3=3 < p1 + p2=6, so enters else clause

x=0, y=3

3 -0 <=3 -3 →3 <=0, false

x=1, y=2

3 -1 <=3 -2 →2 <=1, false

x=2, y=1

3 -2 <=3 -1 →1 <=2, true

Then prints p1 -x + p3 =3 -2 +3=4, but sample output is -1, which doesn't match.

Wait, in sample input 5, output is -1, but according to this code, it would print 4, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is wrong in this case.

Wait, but the problem says that for p1=p2=p3=3, it's impossible, so should print -1, but the code prints p1 -x + p3 =
