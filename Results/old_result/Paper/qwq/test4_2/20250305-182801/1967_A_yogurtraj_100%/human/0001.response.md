Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have some cards with numbers from 1 to n, and I have a_i cards for each number i. I can buy k new cards, and each new card can have any number from 1 to n. After buying the new cards, I need to arrange all my cards in a line and count the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n]. I need to maximize this count.

First, I need to understand what a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] means in this context. It means that in any sequence of n cards, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once. So, in a line of cards, I'm looking for windows of size n where all numbers are unique and cover the entire range from 1 to n.

My goal is to arrange all my cards (after buying k new ones) in such a way that there are as many such windows as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I have t test cases, and for each test case, I have n, k, and a list of a_i's.

Constraints are:

- t ≤ 100

- n can be up to 2*10^5

- k can be up to 10^12

- a_i can be up to 10^12

And the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5*10^5.

Given these constraints, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n log n) per test case or better.

Let me consider what affects the number of valid windows.

In a sequence of cards, a window of size n is a subset of n consecutive cards. For it to be a permutation of [1,2,...,n], each number from 1 to n must appear exactly once in that window.

So, to maximize the number of such windows, I need to maximize the number of positions where such a permutation can be formed.

I need to think about how to arrange the cards to maximize these occurrences.

One way to think about this is to make the sequence as "dense" as possible with all numbers appearing frequently.

But I need to be more precise.

Let me consider the minimal number of times each number appears in the sequence.

For a window of size n to be a permutation, each number must appear at least once in that window.

So, if I have some number that appears very rarely, it will limit the number of windows where that number is present.

Hence, to maximize the number of permutation windows, I need to balance the frequencies of the numbers.

Ideally, I would like all numbers to have the same frequency, so that every window can potentially contain one of each number.

But since I can have different initial counts a_i and can buy k more cards, I need to adjust the frequencies accordingly.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote the final count of cards for each number i as b_i = a_i + c_i, where c_i is the number of new cards I buy for number i, and sum of c_i over all i is <= k.

I need to choose c_i such that the arrangement of all sum(b_i) cards maximizes the number of permutation windows.

Now, how to arrange the cards to maximize the number of permutation windows?

One effective way is to arrange the cards in a periodic manner, where each period is a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

For example, if n=3, I can arrange the cards as [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...]

In this arrangement, every window of size n is a permutation.

But in reality, I might not have exactly multiples of n cards, and the counts of each number might differ.

So, I need to adjust the periods accordingly.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the minimum frequency of any number.

If I have numbers with very low frequencies, they will limit the number of windows where all numbers are present.

Hence, I should try to equalize the frequencies as much as possible, by buying cards for the numbers with lower counts.

Let me consider the minimal frequency among all numbers.

If I can make all frequencies at least m, then I can have m overlapping windows where each window is a permutation.

But it's not that simple, because even if all frequencies are at least m, it doesn't guarantee that I can form m such windows.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the minimal count.

Let me consider that to have a window of size n that is a permutation, I need to have at least one of each number in every n consecutive positions.

But arranging them optimally, I can maximize the number of such windows.

I think a better way is to consider the minimal frequency among all numbers, and then see how many complete sets of n cards I can form.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the minimal number of times any number appears, and then based on that, determine how many windows I can have.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=1, k=10

a=[1]

So, I have one card with number 1, and I can buy 10 new cards, each of which can be 1.

So, I can have a total of 11 cards, all with 1.

The only possible window is of size 1, and since n=1, any single card is a permutation of [1], so there are 11 such windows.

Hence, the output is 11.

In the second test case:

n=2, k=4

a=[8,4]

So, I have 8 cards with 1 and 4 cards with 2.

I can buy 4 new cards, which can be any combination of 1 and 2.

I need to arrange all cards in a line and count the number of windows of size 2 that are permutations of [1,2].

In the explanation, it says to buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2, making the counts [8,8].

Then, arrange them as [1,2,1,2,...] 16 times.

In this arrangement, every pair [1,2] is a permutation, and there are 15 such windows in 16 cards.

But the explanation says there are 8 subarrays [1,2] and 7 subarrays [2,1], totaling 15.

Wait, but in the arrangement [1,2,1,2,...], the windows are all [1,2], not [2,1].

Unless the arrangement alternates in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2], which is 16 cards.

In this arrangement, every consecutive pair is [1,2], and there are 15 such pairs.

So, 15 windows are permutations of [1,2].

I think I get it.

So, in this case, by making sure that I have equal numbers of 1 and 2, I can arrange them in a way that every window of size 2 is a permutation.

Hence, the number of such windows is sum - n + 1, where sum is the total number of cards.

But I need to maximize sum - n + 1, subject to the constraints on a_i and k.

Wait, but in this case, sum is a[0] + a[1] + c_0 + c_1, where c_0 and c_1 are the number of new cards bought for 1 and 2 respectively.

But I need to maximize sum - n + 1, which is equivalent to maximizing sum.

But there's a constraint that c_0 + c_1 <= k, and c_i >= 0.

So, to maximize sum, I need to set c_i such that sum is maximized, but there might be other constraints.

Wait, no, sum is directly maximized by setting c_i = k, but I need to distribute k among c_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to balance the c_i to make sure that no number becomes a bottleneck.

Wait, perhaps I need to make all a_i + c_i as equal as possible.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a multiset of cards with counts b_i = a_i + c_i for each i.

I need to arrange these cards in a sequence where as many windows of size n are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

To maximize this, I need to maximize the number of positions where the window contains one of each number.

This is similar to maximizing the number of positions where all numbers from 1 to n are represented in the next n positions.

I think the way to maximize this is to arrange the cards in a way that the sequence is as balanced as possible, meaning that each number appears as uniformly as possible throughout the sequence.

In other words, I should try to make the frequencies of each number as equal as possible.

So, I should distribute the new cards to the numbers that have lower counts initially, to make the counts as equal as possible.

Once I have the final counts b_i for each i, the total number of cards is sum(b_i).

The number of windows of size n is sum(b_i) - n + 1.

But not all of these windows will be permutations; only those where each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in the window will be permutations.

To maximize the number of such windows, I need to maximize the number of positions where the window contains one of each number.

Given that, I think the maximum number of such windows is equal to (sum(b_i) - n + 1) minus the number of positions where at least one number is missing in the window.

But minimizing the number of positions where at least one number is missing is equivalent to maximizing the number of positions where all numbers are present.

This seems tricky to compute directly.

Perhaps there's a better way to think about this.

Let me consider the minimal frequency among all numbers.

If I have the minimal frequency m, then I can have at most m windows where each window contains one of each number.

But I'm not sure if this is tight.

Wait, actually, it's possible to have more than m windows even if one number has frequency m.

For example, suppose n=2, a=[2,1], and k=0.

So, b=[2,1].

I can arrange them as [1,2,1].

Then, the windows are [1,2] and [2,1], both of which are permutations.

So, even though one number has frequency 1, I can have 2 windows.

Hence, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

So, perhaps the minimal frequency is not the直接限制因素.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have b_i for each i.

I need to arrange the cards in a sequence where the number of windows of size n that contain exactly one of each number is maximized.

This seems similar to arranging the cards to maximize the number of times a sliding window of size n contains one of each number.

I recall that in streaming algorithms, there are concepts related to counting the number of distinct elements in a sliding window.

But I need an algorithmic way to think about this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent the positions, and edges represent the constraints.

But that might be too complicated.

Let me consider the total number of possible windows: sum(b_i) - n + 1.

Out of these, some will be valid permutations, and some won't.

I need to maximize the number of valid ones.

To maximize the number of valid windows, I need to arrange the cards such that as many windows as possible contain one of each number.

One way to achieve this is to arrange the cards in a way that repeats a permutation of [1,2,...,n] as many times as possible.

For example, if n=3 and I have enough cards, I can arrange them as [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...].

In this arrangement, every window of size 3 is a permutation.

So, the number of valid windows is sum(b_i) - n + 1.

But in practice, I might be limited by the counts of certain numbers.

So, I need to find the maximum number of such repeating permutations I can form given the counts b_i.

Let me define m as the minimal value such that b_i >= m for all i.

Then, I can form m complete permutations, each contributing n windows.

Wait, no.

Actually, in m complete permutations, each permutation is of size n, so arranging them consecutively would give (m*n - n + 1) windows that are permutations.

Wait, no.

Wait, in m complete permutations arranged consecutively, like [p1, p2, ..., pm], where each p_j is a permutation of [1,2,...,n], then the number of windows of size n that are permutations would be (m*n - n + 1).

But in reality, some overlaps might not be permutations.

Wait, let's think about m=2 and n=2.

If m=2, and n=2, then arranging two permutations: [1,2,1,2].

Here, the windows are [1,2], [2,1], both of which are permutations.

So, the number of valid windows is m*n - n + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.

But in this case, there are 2*2 - 2 + 1 = 3 windows, but actually, there are 3 windows: [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], all of which are permutations.

Wait, but for n=2, any two different numbers in a window form a permutation.

So, in this case, all windows are permutations.

But if there are duplicates, that's a different story.

Wait, in the earlier example with n=2 and a=[2,1], arranging as [1,2,1], we have three windows: [1,2], [2,1], [1,1].

Only the first two are permutations, since the last one has two 1's.

Hence, the number of valid windows is 2.

So, in general, to maximize the number of valid windows, I need to arrange the cards such that as many windows as possible contain one of each number.

This can be achieved by arranging the cards in a way that minimizes the overlaps where duplicates occur.

One way to do this is to arrange the cards in a periodic manner, with a period of n, where each period is a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

In such an arrangement, every window of size n would be a permutation.

But to do this, I need to have b_i >= ceil(sum(b_i)/n) for each i.

Wait, no.

Actually, in such an arrangement, each number should appear once every n positions.

So, for each number i, the count b_i should be at least the number of times it appears in the periodic sequence.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the minimal frequency.

Let me consider that in a periodic sequence with period n, each number appears exactly once per period.

Hence, to sustain m full periods, I need b_i >= m for each i.

And possibly, I can have some extra cards after m full periods.

So, the maximum number of full periods I can have is m = min(b_i for all i).

Then, the number of windows in m full periods is m*(n - n + 1) = m*1 = m.

Wait, no.

Wait, in m full periods of n cards each, the total number of windows of size n is m*(n - n + 1) = m*1 = m.

But actually, in m periods of n cards, the total number of windows of size n is m*(n - n + 1) = m.

But I think I'm missing something.

Wait, in a sequence of m*n cards, arranged in m periods of n cards each, where each period is a permutation, the number of windows of size n is (m*n - n + 1).

And in this arrangement, each window is a permutation.

Hence, the number of valid windows is (m*n - n + 1).

But to sustain m full periods, I need b_i >= m for all i.

Hence, m = min(b_i for all i).

So, the maximum number of full periods is m = min(b_i for all i).

Then, the number of valid windows is m*(n - n + 1) = m*1 = m.

Wait, but in reality, in m full periods, the number of windows is m*n - n + 1.

Wait, let's take an example.

Suppose n=2, m=3.

Then, sequence is [1,2,1,2,1,2].

Total windows: [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,1], [1,2].

So, 5 windows, which is 3*2 - 2 + 1 = 5.

Hence, the number of windows is m*n - n + 1.

So, in general, if I can arrange m full periods, the number of windows is m*n - n + 1.

And to have m full periods, I need b_i >= m for all i.

Hence, m = min(b_i for all i).

Then, the maximum number of windows is m*n - n + 1.

But I can have extra cards beyond the m full periods.

Suppose I have some b_i > m, then I can extend the sequence beyond the m full periods.

But I need to ensure that the additional cards are arranged in a way that maximizes the number of valid windows.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps there is a better way to model this.

Let me consider that the minimal b_i determines the number of full periods I can have, and each full period contributes (n - n + 1) = 1 window.

Wait, no, as seen in the earlier example, m full periods contribute m*n - n + 1 windows.

Wait, in m periods of n cards each, the total number of windows of size n is m*n - n + 1.

Hence, it's m*n - n + 1.

But I need to maximize this.

Given that m = floor(min(b_i)), and sum(b_i) >= m*n.

Wait, but I can have sum(b_i) > m*n, meaning some extra cards beyond the full periods.

I need to see how these extra cards can be used to create additional windows.

Suppose I have m full periods, contributing m*n - n + 1 windows.

Then, if I have extra cards, I can extend the sequence, potentially creating additional windows.

But I need to ensure that these extra cards are arranged in a way that maximizes the number of valid windows.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps instead of thinking in terms of full periods, I should think in terms of the minimal b_i and the total sum.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of valid windows is sum(b_i) - n + 1, provided that b_i >= sum(b_i)-n+1 for all i.

But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal b_i and see how many windows I can form based on that.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the idea of the minimal b_i to determine the number of full periods and then add the extra windows from the remaining cards.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let m = floor(min(b_i)).

Then, I can have m full periods, contributing m*n - n + 1 windows.

Then, the remaining cards for each i are b_i - m.

Let s = sum(b_i - m) for all i.

Then, I can extend the sequence by s cards.

In this extension, I need to arrange the remaining cards in a way that maximizes the number of valid windows.

Each additional card can potentially add one more window, but I need to ensure that the window contains one of each number.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better mathematical approach.

Let me consider that in order to have a window of size n being a permutation, I need to have each number appearing exactly once in that window.

Hence, for each position i from 1 to sum(b_i) - n + 1, the window from i to i+n-1 should contain exactly one of each number.

To maximize the number of such windows, I need to maximize the number of positions i where this condition holds.

This seems akin to maximizing the number of positions where the multiset of the window is exactly one of each number.

This is equivalent to minimizing the number of positions where the window does not contain one of the numbers.

I think this is similar to the problem of covering the sequence with the constraints that each window must contain one of each number.

But I need a more direct approach.

Let me consider the following formula:

The maximum number of valid windows is sum(b_i) - n + 1 - (n - 1)*max(b_i - m),

where m = floor(min(b_i)).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the minimal limiting factor.

Let me consider that the minimal b_i determines the number of full periods I can have, and then the remaining cards can be arranged to extend the sequence and create additional windows.

Hence, the total number of windows would be m*(n - 1) + sum(b_i) - m*n,

where m = floor(min(b_i)).

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look at another example.

Take n=3, a=[6,1,8], k=9.

After buying k=9 cards, suppose I buy c=[3,8,0], so b=[9,9,8].

Then, I can arrange them in a sequence like [1,2,3,1,2,3,...], but since b_2=9 and b_3=8, I need to see how many full periods I can have.

Wait, m = min(b_i) = 8.

So, I can have 8 full periods of [1,2,3], contributing 8 windows.

But sum(b_i) = 9+9+8=26.

So, the number of windows is 26 - 3 + 1 = 24.

But in the full periods, I have 8 windows.

Wait, no.

Wait, in 8 periods of 3 cards each, I have total cards = 24.

But sum(b_i)=26, so I have 2 extra cards.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, if m = 8, and sum(b_i)=26, then I can have 8 full periods contributing 8*(3 - 3 +1)=8 windows.

Then, with the remaining 2 cards, I can add them to the sequence, but they might not form complete windows.

Hence, the total number of windows is 8 + something.

But in reality, it's more complicated.

I think I need to find a better way to calculate this.

Perhaps I should look for the minimal b_i and see how many full windows I can have based on that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum(b_i) - n*max(0, sum(b_i)-n*m) + n*m - n +1.

Wait, I'm getting lost.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I set b_i = a_i + c_i for all i, with sum(c_i) <=k.

I need to maximize the number of windows where the multiset of the window is a permutation.

This is equivalent to maximizing the number of positions i where the window from i to i+n-1 contains exactly one of each number.

This can be reformulated as maximizing the number of i where, for all j from 1 to n, the frequency of j in the window is exactly one.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I should consider the dual problem: minimizing the number of windows that are not permutations.

But that doesn't seem helpful.

Let me consider that in order to have a window being a permutation, I need to have each number appearing exactly once in the window.

Hence, for a window to be invalid, at least one number is missing or has duplicate.

To maximize the number of valid windows, I need to arrange the cards such that as many windows as possible have exactly one of each number.

This seems similar to maximizing the number of times the multiset condition is met.

I think I need to find a way to maximize sum over i of [window i is a permutation].

This seems too abstract.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can model this problem using the idea of sliding windows and frequency counts.

If I fix the arrangement of cards, I can compute the number of valid windows.

But I need to choose the arrangement that maximizes this count.

Given that, perhaps I can find a formula based on the frequencies b_i.

Let me consider that in the optimal arrangement, the sequence is constructed by repeating a permutation as much as possible.

Hence, the number of valid windows would be the number of full permutations minus some overlap issues.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look at the formula provided in the code.

In the given code:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Initialize r = a[0].

- Compute r based on some conditions involving k and i.

- Finally, print (r -1)*n +1 + something.

I need to understand what this formula represents.

Given that, perhaps the formula is (r -1)*n +1 + rem + y.

I need to see what r, rem, and y represent in this context.

From the code:

- a is sorted.

- r is initialized to a[0].

- Then, for each i from 0 to n-2, it checks if (i+1)*(a[i+1]-a[i]) > k.

- If yes, set r = a[i] + k//(i+1), rem = k %(i+1), y = n-1 -i, and break.

- If k is still not zero after the loop, set r = a[n-1] + k//n, and print (r-
