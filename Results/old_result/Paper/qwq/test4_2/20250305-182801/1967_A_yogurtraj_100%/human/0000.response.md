Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, I have some cards, each with an integer from 1 to n, and I have a_i cards of each type i. I can buy k new cards, and each new card can be any integer from 1 to n. After buying, I arrange all my cards in a line, and I need to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

First, I need to understand what a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] means in this context. It means that in any subarray of length n, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

So, my goal is to arrange all my cards (after buying k new ones) in such a way that the number of these special subarrays is maximized.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I recall that in array problems, especially those involving subarrays with specific properties, sliding window techniques are often useful. Maybe I can apply something similar here.

But before jumping into algorithms, I need to understand what constraints I'm working with.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^12, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) at worst, since t, the number of test cases, can be up to 100, and the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 5*10^5.

First, I need to think about how buying k new cards can help me maximize the number of these special subarrays.

I should consider that the more flexible I am in choosing the cards, the better I can arrange them to have more of these subarrays.

Wait, but I have to buy k cards, each can be any number from 1 to n, and then arrange all the cards in a single line.

I need to maximize the number of subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

Hmm.

Let me try to rephrase the problem.

I have a multiset of cards, with a_i cards of each type i, and I can add k more cards, each of any type from 1 to n.

Then, I arrange all these cards in a line and count the number of positions where the subarray of length n starting at that position is a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n].

I need to maximize this count.

I need to maximize the number of positions where, in the next n cards, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

I need to think about how to arrange the cards to maximize such positions.

One way to think about it is to maximize the number of positions where the multiset of the next n cards is exactly one of each number from 1 to n.

But arranging the cards optimally to maximize this count sounds tricky.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of sliding window and count the number of valid windows.

But before that, I need to decide which cards to buy and how to arrange all the cards.

Wait a minute, the problem allows me to buy k cards and arrange all the cards in any order.

So, I can choose to buy k cards of any types, and then arrange all the cards in any order.

I need to maximize the number of subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

I think the key here is to maximize the number of times the multiset {1,2,...,n} appears in windows of length n.

I need to think about how to arrange the cards to maximize the number of such windows.

Perhaps I can arrange the cards in such a way that as many n-length segments as possible contain each number exactly once.

But arranging the cards optimally seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can think about the maximum possible number of such windows given the frequencies of the cards.

Let me consider that in any arrangement, the number of such windows is limited by the card that appears the least number of times, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, actually, in order for a window to be a permutation of [1,2,...,n], each number must appear exactly once in that window.

So, the limiting factor might be the card that appears the fewest times, but I need to think more carefully.

I recall that in some sliding window problems, we maintain a frequency map and move the window, adjusting counts.

But here, since I can arrange the cards in any order, it's different.

I can arrange the cards in any order, so perhaps I can arrange them in a way that the multiset condition is satisfied as much as possible.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of times the multiset {1,2,...,n} can fit into the overall multiset of cards I have after buying k cards.

But that might not directly give me the number of contiguous subarrays.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about creating runs of n cards that are permutations, and see how many such runs I can pack into the entire array.

But I need to maximize the number of overlapping runs.

Wait, subarrays of length n overlapping by n-1 elements.

I need to think about how these subarrays overlap.

Wait, no, subarrays are contiguous and of length n, so the number of such subarrays in an array of length L is L - n + 1.

But I need to maximize how many of these L - n + 1 subarrays are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

But arranging the array to maximize this count seems tricky.

Perhaps I need to look for a pattern that repeats the permutation as much as possible.

Wait, maybe I can think of the array as being divided into blocks of size n, and try to make as many of these blocks as possible be permutations.

But overlapping blocks can share elements, so perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as trying to cover the array with as many n-length windows that are permutations as possible.

But I need to maximize the number of such windows.

I need to find the maximum number of windows where each window is a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

Given that I can arrange the cards in any order, I need to arrange them to maximize the number of such windows.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the frequencies.

Suppose I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fn for each card type after buying k cards.

I need to arrange these cards in a sequence where as many n-length windows as possible have each fi >=1.

Wait, no, each window must have exactly one of each type.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times I can place a window of n distinct types.

But I need to maximize the number of such windows in the arrangement.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I should look for a formula or a mathematical way to compute this without explicitly arranging the cards.

I need to find a way to compute the maximum number of n-length subarrays that are permutations of [1,2,...,n], given that I can arrange the cards in any order after buying k cards.

Let me consider the initial number of cards I have: a1, a2, ..., an.

After buying k cards, the total number of cards I have is s = sum(a_i) + k.

The number of possible windows is s - n + 1.

I need to maximize how many of these windows are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

But arranging the cards to maximize this count seems non-trivial.

Perhaps I can think about arranging the cards in a way that groups of n cards have each number exactly once.

Wait, maybe I can arrange the cards in a sequence where I repeat the pattern [1,2,...,n] as much as possible.

But I need to consider the frequencies of each card.

If I have enough cards of each type, I can repeat the pattern [1,2,...,n] multiple times.

But if some cards are limited, I need to adjust accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can compute how many complete blocks of [1,2,...,n] I can form, given the frequencies.

Let me define b_i = floor(a_i / 1), since each block needs exactly one of each.

But since I can buy k additional cards, I can increase the a_i's before taking floor.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimum of a_i's after adding k cards distributed optimally.

Wait, no.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I distribute the k additional cards to maximize the number of complete blocks.

Each block requires one of each type.

So, the number of complete blocks I can form is limited by the smallest a_i after adding the k cards.

Wait, not exactly.

Because I can distribute the k cards to increase the a_i's, and I should distribute them to balance the a_i's.

Wait, perhaps I should distribute the k cards to maximize the minimum a_i.

Because the number of complete blocks is limited by the smallest a_i.

So, if I can make all a_i's as equal as possible, then the number of complete blocks would be floor(min(a_i)).

Wait, but I can arrange the cards in a way that the blocks are packed tightly.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximum x such that, after buying k cards, all a_i >= x.

Then, the number of complete blocks would be x, and the number of windows would be x.

But actually, in an arrangement where I have x complete blocks, I can have overlapping windows.

Wait, no, in a sequence like [1,2,3,...,n,1,2,3,...,n,...], each block is non-overlapping.

But in this problem, the subarrays are contiguous and of length n, so overlapping subarrays share elements.

Wait, no, in an array of length L, the number of subarrays of length n is L - n + 1.

If I have a sequence that is a concatenation of b blocks of [1,2,3,...,n], then the number of windows that are permutations is b, because each block contributes one window.

But actually, in such a sequence, there are overlapping windows that are also permutations.

Wait, in a sequence like [1,2,3,1,2,3], for n=3, the windows are:

[1,2,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2]

Each of these is a permutation of [1,2,3].

So, in this case, with b=2 blocks, I have 4 windows that are permutations.

Wait, no, in this sequence of length 5, for n=3, there are 5-3+1=3 windows, all of which are permutations.

So, with b=2 blocks, I can have more than b windows that are permutations.

Hence, my initial assumption is incorrect.

So, perhaps arranging the sequence in a way that the blocks overlap by n-1 elements can maximize the number of windows.

Wait, for example, in a sequence like [1,2,3,2,3,1,3,1,2], for n=3, the windows are:

[1,2,3], [2,3,2], [3,2,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [1,2,3]

Here, some of these are permutations, some are not.

So, perhaps arranging the sequence in a way that maximizes the number of windows that are permutations.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the total number of possible windows, which is s - n + 1, where s is the total number of cards after buying k cards.

I need to maximize the number of these windows that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

To maximize this, I need to arrange the cards in a way that as many n-length segments as possible have each number from 1 to n exactly once.

But arranging the cards optimally to maximize this count is not straightforward.

Perhaps I can model this problem using the frequencies of the cards.

Suppose I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fn for each card type after buying k cards.

Then, the maximum number of windows that are permutations is limited by the smallest frequency, because each window consumes one of each type.

But actually, since windows overlap, one card can be part of multiple windows.

So, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times I can place a window without reusing any card more than its frequency allows.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let’s define that each card can be used in multiple windows, but not more times than its frequency allows.

So, for each card, the number of windows it can be part of is floor((s - n + 1) / (s - f_i)), but I'm not sure.

This seems too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, to maximize the number of overlapping subarrays that satisfy a condition, we can use the pigeonhole principle or something similar.

But here, I need to maximize the number of subarrays of length n that are permutations, given that I can arrange the cards optimally.

Wait, perhaps I can think about arranging the cards in a way that the sequence contains as many n-length segments as possible that are permutations, by maximizing the repetition of such patterns.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that each permutation of [1,2,...,n] can be used multiple times in the sequence, arranged in a way that maximizes overlaps.

For example, for n=3, if I arrange the sequence as [1,2,3,2,3,1,3,1,2], then I have multiple windows that are permutations.

But I need to generalize this.

Perhaps I can arrange the sequence in a cyclic manner, where each block overlaps with the next by n-1 elements.

But I need to ensure that the frequencies of the cards allow for this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a de Bruijn sequence or something similar, but that might be overkill.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that in order to have as many windows as possible that are permutations, I need to maximize the number of positions where the next n cards form a permutation.

To do this, I need to arrange the cards so that as much as possible, every n-length segment has each number from 1 to n exactly once.

Given that I can arrange the cards in any order and I can buy up to k additional cards, I need to maximize this count.

I need to find a way to compute this maximum count efficiently.

Perhaps I can think about the problem in terms of the least frequent card.

The number of windows that can be formed is limited by the card that appears the fewest times.

But since windows overlap, it's not just the minimum frequency.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the minimum frequency minus the number of times it's used in the windows.

But I need a better way.

Let me consider that each window uses one of each card.

So, the total number of windows is limited by the sum over (f_i - (L - n + 1)) for each i, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the critical cards, i.e., the cards that limit the number of possible windows.

I need to maximize the number of windows, which is equivalent to arranging the cards to have as many n-length segments as possible that are permutations.

This seems similar to covering the array with as many n-length permutation windows as possible.

But I need a better approach.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the second test case:

n=2, k=4

a=[8,4]

One possible arrangement is [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]

Which has 8 subarrays [1,2] and 7 subarrays [2,1], totaling 15.

So, in this case, they bought 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2, making a total of 8 type 1 and 8 type 2 cards.

Then, arranged them in an alternating pattern to maximize the number of permutation windows.

In this arrangement, every window of length 2 is either [1,2] or [2,1], both of which are permutations.

Hence, the number of such windows is L - n + 1 = 16 - 2 + 1 = 15, which matches the output.

So, in this case, they arranged the cards in a way that every possible window is a permutation.

So, perhaps the maximum number of such windows is L - n + 1, provided that the frequencies allow it.

But in this case, they had enough cards to arrange them in such a way.

So, perhaps the maximum number of such windows is min(L - n + 1, sum_fi - n + 1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximum L such that L - n + 1 is maximized, given that the frequencies allow arranging the cards in a way that every window of length n is a permutation.

But I need to consider the frequencies.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximum L where L = sum_fi, and arrange the cards in a way that as many windows as possible are permutations.

Given that, perhaps I need to maximize L - n + 1, which is the number of possible windows, subject to the frequencies allowing it.

But I need to find a way to compute the maximum number of windows that can be permutations.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in order to have a window of n cards being a permutation, each number from 1 to n must appear exactly once in that window.

So, for a window to be a permutation, it must contain one of each number.

Hence, the total number of such windows is limited by the card that appears the fewest number of times.

But since windows overlap, it's not just the minimum frequency.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of sliding window and frequency counts.

But since I can arrange the cards in any order, I need to arrange them optimally to maximize the number of valid windows.

Let me consider that if I arrange the cards in a way that the sequence is a repetition of the permutation [1,2,...,n], then the number of valid windows would be floor(s / n).

But in the example, they arranged it in an alternating pattern to have more overlapping windows.

Wait, in the second test case, n=2, and they arranged [1,2,1,2,...] sixteen times, resulting in 15 windows, all of which are permutations.

So, in this case, they maximized the number of windows by arranging the cards in an alternating pattern.

Hence, perhaps the key is to arrange the cards in a way that the sequence is as "dense" as possible with permutations.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as arranging the cards in a way that minimizes the number of invalid windows.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in order to have as many windows as possible being permutations, I need to maximize the number of positions where the next n cards are a permutation.

This can be achieved by arranging the cards in a way that the sequence is a repetition of a permutation pattern with maximal overlap.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the sequence in such a way that each new window differs from the previous one by only one element, ensuring that as many windows as possible are permutations.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of times each card appears.

Suppose I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fn.

Then, the total number of windows is limited by the sum of frequencies minus n +1, but again, that's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal frequency and see how many complete sets of [1,2,...,n] I can form.

But in the second test case, minimal frequency after buying cards was 8, and they arranged 16 cards, resulting in 15 windows, all being permutations.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of windows is sum_fi - n +1, provided that the frequencies are balanced enough.

But I need to consider that some frequencies might be lower, limiting the number of windows.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal frequency after distributing the k cards to maximize the minimal frequency.

Then, the number of windows would be minimal_frequency -1 * n +1.

Wait, not sure.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, to maximize the number of subarrays with certain properties, we can use a sliding window approach.

But in this case, since I can arrange the cards in any order, I need to choose an arrangement that maximizes the count.

Perhaps I should look for a mathematical formula that relates the frequencies to the maximum number of windows.

Let me consider that in order to have a window being a permutation, each card in the window must be unique.

Hence, for each window, I need to have one of each card.

So, the total number of such windows is limited by the card that appears the fewest number of times.

But since windows overlap, one card can be part of multiple windows.

Hence, the actual limit is higher.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total possible windows, which is sum_fi -n +1, but constrained by the frequencies.

But I need a better way to think about this.

Let me consider that each window consumes one of each card in it.

But since windows overlap, some cards are reused in multiple windows.

Hence, the frequencies need to support the arrangement.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I should look for a formula that directly computes the maximum number of windows based on the frequencies.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as trying to cover the array with as many n-length permutation windows as possible, with overlaps.

But I need a way to compute this.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have a sequence of length L, and I place a window at the beginning that is a permutation.

Then, the next window overlaps by n-1 elements.

So, if the next window also needs to be a permutation, I need to ensure that the new element is different from the previous n-1 elements.

This seems too involved.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in order to maximize the number of permutation windows, I need to maximize the number of positions where the next n cards are a permutation.

Hence, I need to arrange the cards in a way that as many n-length segments as possible have each number exactly once.

This seems similar to arranging the cards in a way that minimizes the repetition of the same numbers in close proximity.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that if I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fn, and I arrange the cards in a sequence where the frequencies are distributed as evenly as possible, then I can maximize the number of permutation windows.

This sounds promising.

So, perhaps I need to distribute the cards as uniformly as possible.

In that case, the number of permutation windows would be limited by the card that appears the fewest number of times, but adjusted for the overlaps.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal frequency after distributing the k cards.

Let me try to find the minimal frequency among all a_i after adding k cards optimally.

Then, the number of permutation windows would be roughly minimal_frequency -1 *n +1, but I'm not sure.

This seems unclear.

Let me consider that if I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fn, and I arrange the cards in a sequence where the cards are distributed as uniformly as possible, then the number of permutation windows would be sum_fi -n +1, but limited by the minimal frequency.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the minimal frequency after adding k cards, and then the number of permutation windows would be minimal_frequency + floor((sum_fi - minimal_frequency)/n).

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the frequencies in ascending order: a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-1]

Then, I need to make sure that the minimal frequency is as high as possible.

Because the number of permutation windows is limited by the minimal frequency.

Wait, but with overlapping windows, it's not just the minimal frequency.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal a_i and see how many times I can place a window where all a_i are at least the number of windows.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximal x such that, for all i, a_i >= x.

Then, x would be the number of permutation windows.

But again, with overlapping windows, this might not hold.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximal x such that, for all i, a_i >= ceil(x / n).

Because each window consumes one of each card, and with overlaps, each additional window might only consume one additional card.

But I need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximal x such that, for all i, a_i >= ceil(x / n).

Because each window requires one of each card, but with overlaps, some cards are reused.

Hence, the frequency of each card must be at least ceil(x / n), because each card is used in ceil(x / n) windows.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me consider that each card is used in ceil(x / n) windows.

Hence, to have x windows, each card must appear at least ceil(x / n) times.

So, the minimal frequency should be at least ceil(x / n).

Hence, x <= n * floor(min_a_i).

But this seems too restrictive.

Wait, let's see.

If min_a_i = floor(x / n), then x <= n * min_a_i.

But I need to maximize x.

Wait, perhaps x <= n * min_a_i.

But in the second test case, min_a_i =8, n=2, so x <= 16, which matches the arrangement they made.

But in that case, L=16, and L -n +1=15, which is the number of windows.

Hence, perhaps x = L -n +1.

Wait, but x is the number of permutation windows.

So, x = L -n +1.

Hence, x <= n * min_a_i.

But in the second test case, L=16, n=2, min_a_i=8, so x=15 <=16.

Wait, but 15 <= 16 holds.

But I need to maximize x, which is L -n +1, subject to L <= sum_fi, and min_a_i >= ceil(x / n).

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize x such that min_a_i >= ceil((x + n -1)/n).

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize x such that for all i, a_i >= ceil((x + n -1)/n).

Because each card must appear at least ceil((x + n -1)/n) times.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize x such that min_a_i >= ceil((x + n -1)/n).

Then, x <= min_a_i *n -n +1.

Wait, let's see.

If min_a_i >= ceil((x + n -1)/n), then x <= min_a_i *n -n +1.

Hence, x = min_a_i *n -n +1.

Wait, in the second test case, min_a_i=8, n=2, so x=8*2 -2 +1=15, which matches the output.

Similarly, in the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1], so after buying k cards, a=[11], min_a_i=11, x=11*1 -1 +1=11, which matches the output.

Another test case: n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8]

After sorting, a=[1,6,8]

We can add k=4 to the minimal a_i, so a=[5,6,8], min_a_i=5, x=5*3 -3 +1=15, which matches the output.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, a=[7,6,2], after sorting a=[2,6,7], adding k=9 to the minimal a_i, a=[11,6,7], min_a_i=6, x=6*3 -3 +1=16, but the output is 22, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in that case, a=[7,6,2], sum_a=15, k=9, total cards=24.

Then, L=24, x=L -n +1=24 -3 +1=22, which matches the output.

But according to the earlier formula, min_a_i=2 +9=11, x=11*3 -3 +1=31, but the output is 22, which is less than 31.

Hence, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to cap x at L -n +1.

Because even if min_a_i allows for more windows, the actual number of windows is limited by L -n +1.

But in this case, L=24, x=22, which is less than 31, and matches the output.

Hence, perhaps x = min(L -n +1, n * min_a_i -n +1).

But in the second test case, L=16, n=2, min_a_i=8, n*min_a_i -n +1=16 -2 +1=15, which matches the output.

In another test case, n=5, k=3, a=[6,6,7,4,6], sum_a=30, k=3, total L=33, x=33-5 +1=29.

But according to the output, it's 28, which is less than 29.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, in that case, min_a_i=4 +3=7, n=5, x=7*5 -5 +1=31, but L=33, so x=min(33-5 +1=29,31)=29, but output is 28.

Hence, perhaps my formula is still incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after adding k cards to the minimal a_i, the minimal a_i becomes min_a_i + k.

But in the case where k is distributed optimally, it might not be just adding k to the minimal a_i.

Perhaps I need to distribute k cards to maximize the minimal a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to perform a process where I distribute k cards to maximize the minimal a_i.

This sounds like a classic optimization problem.

Hence, perhaps I can perform a binary search on the minimal a_i after adding k cards, and find the maximal x such that min_a_i >= ceil((x + n -1)/n).

Wait, but in practice, I need to find the minimal a_i after adding k cards optimally.

To maximize the minimal a_i, I can distribute the k cards to the a_i with the smallest values.

This is similar to the problem of distributing items to maximize the minimal value.

Hence, I can sort the a_i in ascending order, and then try to make the a_i as equal as possible by distributing the k cards.

Then, the minimal a_i would be a[0] + floor(k / n), plus some remainder.

Wait, more precisely, I can add floor(k / n) to each a_i, and then distribute the remaining k % n to the first k % n a_i's.

Hence, the minimal a_i would be a[0] + floor(k / n).

But wait, in the second test case, n=2, k=4, a=[8,4], after adding floor(4/2)=2 to each, a becomes [10,6], min_a_i=6.

Then, x=6*2 -2 +1=11, but the output is 15.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to add floor(k / n) to each a_i, and then see how many permutation windows I can form.

But in this case, a=[10,6], min_a_i=6, x=6*2 -2 +1=11, but the output is 15.

Hence, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that after adding k cards, the total number of cards is s = sum_a_i +k.

Then, the maximum number of permutation windows is s -n +1.

But I need to ensure that the frequencies allow it.

Hence, perhaps x = min(s -n +1, n * min_a_i -n +1).

In the second test case, s=8+4+0=12, k=4, total s=16, x=min(16-2 +1=15, 2*8 -2 +1=15), which matches the output.

In another test case, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8], sum_a=15, s=19, x=min(19-3 +1=17, 3*5 -3 +1=17), but the output is 15.

Wait, but earlier I thought min_a_i=5, but let's see.

a=[6,1,8], sort to [1,6,8], add k=4, distribute to make a=[5,6,8], min_a_i=5, x=5*3 -3 +1=15, which matches the output.

Hence, perhaps x = n * min_a_i -n +1.

But in the previous test case, n=2, k=4, a=[8,4], sum_a=12, s=16, x=min(16-2 +1=15, 2*8 -2 +1=15), which matches.

In another test case, n=3, k=9, a=[7,6,2], sum_a=15, s=24, x=min(24-3 +1=22, 3*6 -3 +1=22), which matches the output 22.

In another test case, n=5, k=3, a=[6,6,7,4,6], sum_a=30, s=33, x=min(33-5 +1=29,5*7 -5 +1=31), but output is 28.

Wait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, in this case, a=[4,6,6,6,7], after sorting.

To maximize min_a_i, distribute k=3 to the smallest a_i's.

So, a becomes [7,6,6,6,7], min_a_i=6, x=6*5 -5 +1=26, but output is 28.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute x = s -n +1, but limited by the minimal a_i.

Wait, in this case, s=33, x=33-5 +1=29, but output is 28.

Hence, perhaps x = min(s -n +1, n * floor((sum_a_i +k)/n) -n +1).

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the average frequency.

But this is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the maximum number of permutation windows is limited by the minimal a_i, but adjusted for overlaps.

Hence, perhaps x = min_a_i + floor((sum_a_i - min_a_i)/n).

Wait, in the test case where a=[7,6,6,6,7], sum_a_i=32, k=3, s=35, min_a_i=6, x=6 + floor((35 -6)/5)=6 + floor(29/5)=6 +5=11, which is less than the output 28.

Hence, this formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each additional window beyond min_a_i requires consuming one additional card from each type.

Hence, the number of additional windows is limited by the sum of the excess frequencies over min_a_i.

Wait, perhaps x = min_a_i + floor((sum_a_i - n * min_a_i)/(n -1))

But in the test case, a=[7,6,6,6,7], sum_a_i=32, n=5, min_a_i=6, sum_a_i - n * min_a_i=32 -30=2, floor(2/(5-1))=0, so x=6+0=6, which is less than the output 28.

Hence, this is also incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that in order to have x permutation windows, I need to have for each i, a_i >= ceil(x / n).

Because each window consumes one of each card, and with overlaps, each additional window beyond floor(x / n) requires an additional card.

Hence, a_i >= ceil(x / n).

Hence, x <= floor(min_a_i * n -n +1).

Wait, in the test case a=[7,6,6,6,7], min_a_i=6, n=5, x <= floor(6*5 -5 +1)=floor(30 -5 +1)=26, but the output is 28.

Hence, this is still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that x <= min(s -n +1, n * floor((sum_a_i +k)/n) -n +1).

Wait, in this case, sum_a_i=32, k=3, sum_a_i +k=35, floor(35/5)=7, x=7*5 -5 +1=31, but output is 28.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that x <= sum_a_i +k -n +1, but in this case, x<=35-5 +1=31, which is more than 28.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider that x <= min_a_i *n -n +1.

But in this case, min_a_i=7, n=5, x<=35-5 +1=31, but output is 28.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that x <= sum_a_i +k -n +1 - (n -1) * (floor((sum_a_i +k -n +1)/n) -1)

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the a_i in ascending order.

Then, I can add k cards to the smallest a_i's to maximize the minimal a_i.

Hence, the minimal a_i after adding k cards would be a[0] + floor(k / n).

Then, the number of permutation windows x is limited by the minimal a_i.

But as seen in earlier test cases, x = minimal_a_i *n -n +1.

But this doesn't match all the test cases.

Wait, perhaps I need to perform a binary search on x, and check if it's possible to have x permutation windows given the frequencies.

This might be a way to approach it.

Hence, I can perform a binary search on x, from 0 to sum_a_i +k -n +1.

For each x, I need to check if it's possible to have x permutation windows, given the frequencies.

To check if x permutation windows are possible, each a_i must be >= ceil(x / n).

Hence, x <= min_a_i *n -n +1.

Wait, perhaps x <= min_a_i *n -n +1.

But as seen in earlier test cases, this doesn't always hold.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me consider that for x permutation windows, each a_i must be at least ceil(x / n).

Hence, x <= floor(min_a_i *n).

But in the test case where min_a_i=6, n=5, x<=30, but output is 28.

Wait, perhaps x <= min_a_i *n -n +1.

In this case, x<=30 -5 +1=26, but output is 28.

Hence, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that x <= sum_a_i +k -n +1, and x <= min_a_i *n.

But in the test case, sum_a_i +k -n +1=35-5 +1=31, and min_a_i *n=35, which is more than 28.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider x <= min(sum_a_i +k -n +1, min_a_i *n).

But in this case, x<=min(31,35)=31, but output is 28.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that x <= sum_a_i +k -n +1, and x <= min_a_i *n -n +1.

In this case, x<=min(31,26)=26, but output is 28.

Still not matching.

Hence, my formula is incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that in order to have x permutation windows, I need to have at least x occurrences of each card.

Because each window requires one of each card.

Hence, for each card, a_i >= ceil(x / n).

Hence, x <= floor(min_a_i *n).

But in the test case, min_a_i=6, n=5, x<=30, but output is 28.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that x <= floor(min_a_i *n - (n -1))

In this case, x<=30 -4=26, which matches the output 28.

Wait, no, 30 -4=26, which is less than 28.

Hence, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps x <= min_a_i *n -n +1.

In this case, x<=30 -5 +1=26, but output is 28.

Still not matching.

Hence, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have s = sum_a_i +k total cards.

The maximum possible number of permutation windows is s -n +1.

But I need to ensure that the frequencies allow it.

Hence, perhaps x = s -n +1 - invalid_windows.

But I need to compute the maximal x such that it's possible to arrange the cards to have x permutation windows.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that in order to maximize x, I need to maximize the minimal a_i, and then compute x based on that.

Hence, I can sort a_i in ascending order, and then add k cards to the smallest a_i's to maximize the minimal a_i.

Hence, the minimal a_i after adding k cards would be a[0] + floor(k / n).

Then, x = minimal_a_i *n -n +1.

But as seen in earlier test cases, this doesn't always hold.

Wait, perhaps x = minimal_a_i + floor((sum_a_i +k - minimal_a_i)/n).

In the test case
