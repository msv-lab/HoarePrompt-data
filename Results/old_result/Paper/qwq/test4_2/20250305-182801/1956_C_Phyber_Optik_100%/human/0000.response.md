Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n by n matrix, initially all zeros, and I can perform two types of operations. Each operation allows me to set a whole row or a whole column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix, and I need to do this with no more than 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. A type 1 operation lets me choose a row and set its elements to any permutation of 1 to n. Similarly, a type 2 operation lets me choose a column and set its elements to any permutation of 1 to n.

Since I can choose any permutation for a row or a column, I can essentially set any value from 1 to n in any cell, but with the constraint that in a row or column, each number appears only once because it's a permutation.

Wait, actually, no. If I set a row, I can choose any permutation for that row, but if I set a column later, it might overwrite some of the values I set in the row.

This seems a bit tricky. I need to think about how these operations interact with each other.

Let me consider a small value of n, say n=2, to get a better understanding.

For n=2, the matrix is 2x2, all zeros initially.

Operation 1: Choose a row and set it to a permutation of [1,2].

Operation 2: Choose a column and set it to a permutation of [1,2].

I can perform up to 4 operations (2n=4).

Let's see what the example in the problem does for n=2.

In the example, they perform 3 operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [1,2]

After these operations, the matrix looks like:

Column 1: [1,2] (set by type 2 operation on column 1)

Column 2: [2,2] (set by type 1 operations on rows 1 and 2)

So the matrix is:

1 2

2 2

Sum is 1+2+2+2 = 7.

The problem says this is the maximum sum achievable.

Now, is there a way to get a higher sum with at most 4 operations?

Let's try.

Option 1: Perform type 1 on both rows and type 2 on both columns.

But I need to see the order because operations can overwrite each other.

Option 2: Maybe set columns first and then rows.

Let's try:

1. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [2,1]

2. Type 2 on column 2: set column 2 to [2,1]

Now the matrix is:

2 2

1 1

Sum is 2+2+1+1=6, which is less than 7.

Not better.

Another try:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [2,1]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [2,1]

4. Type 2 on column 2: set column 2 to [1,2]

After these operations:

From type 1 operations:

Row 1: [2,1]

Row 2: [2,1]

Then type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [2,1], which overwrites row 1, column 1 to 2 and row 2, column 1 to 1.

Then type 2 on column 2: set column 2 to [1,2], which overwrites row 1, column 2 to 1 and row 2, column 2 to 2.

So the final matrix is:

2 1

1 2

Sum is 2+1+1+2=6, which is less than 7.

Another try:

1. Type 1 on row 1: [2,1]

2. Type 2 on column 1: [2,1]

3. Type 2 on column 2: [2,1]

Result:

Row 1: [2,1]

Row 2: [1,1]

Sum: 2+1+1+1=5, worse.

Another approach: Maybe I can get higher values in the matrix by strategic ordering.

Wait, but in n=2, the highest I can get is 2 in any cell. So, sum 7 seems optimal.

Wait, but in the first try, I had [1,2;2,2], sum 7.

Is there a way to get [2,2;2,2], sum 8?

Let's see.

If I set row 1 to [2,1], then set column 2 to [2,2], then set row 1 again to [2,1], then set column 1 to [2,1].

Wait, but operations are applied in sequence, and each operation overwrites the previous values in the row or column.

So, for example:

Start with all zeros.

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [2,1]

Matrix:

2 1

0 0

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 2: set column 2 to [2,2]

Matrix:

2 2

0 2

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [2,1]

Matrix:

2 2

2 1

Sum: 2+2+2+1=7

Same as before.

Seems like 7 is the maximum.

So, for n=2, sum=7 with 3 operations.

The program provided outputs sum=7 and 4 operations, which is acceptable since m<=2n=4.

Now, for n=1, it's straightforward. Only one cell, set to 1 with one operation.

Now, generalizing to any n.

I need to maximize the sum of the matrix, with operations that set entire rows or columns to permutations of 1 to n.

Each operation overwrites the entire row or column.

So, the key is to maximize the values in the matrix, given that operations can overwrite each other.

I need to think about the order of operations to maximize the highest values in the matrix.

Let me consider that higher values should be placed in as many cells as possible, but constrained by the permutations.

Wait, in a permutation, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in a row or column.

So, in a row, I can have each number from 1 to n exactly once.

Similarly for a column.

But since operations can overwrite each other, I need to think carefully.

Let me think of it as assigning values to rows and columns in a way that the maximum possible values are achieved in the cells.

I recall that in matrix terms, the cell values are determined by the last operation that set that row or that column.

Wait, actually, each operation sets entire rows or columns, so the cell value is the last operation that set that row or column.

Wait, no. When I set a row, I set all its cells at once, and similarly for a column.

So, if I set a row and then set a column, the cell at the intersection will be set by the last operation.

So, the cell value is determined by the last operation that set that row or column.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to arrange operations such that higher values are set in as many cells as possible.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the rows and columns I'm going to operate on, and the order of operations.

Then, for each cell, its final value will be the value set by the last operation that set its row or column.

So, I need to choose permutations for rows and columns in such a way that the maximum possible values are achieved in the cells based on the last operation that set them.

This sounds complicated.

Maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to calculate the maximum sum.

Looking back at the example for n=2, sum=7.

For n=1, sum=1.

For n=3, what would be the maximum sum?

Let's try n=3.

If I perform type 1 operations on all three rows and type 2 operations on all three columns, that's 6 operations, which is 2n.

But I need to see what sum I can achieve.

Let's try setting rows first:

Set row 1 to [3,2,1]

Set row 2 to [3,2,1]

Set row 3 to [3,2,1]

Then set column 1 to [3,2,1]

Set column 2 to [3,2,1]

Set column 3 to [3,2,1]

Now, let's see what the matrix looks like.

After setting rows:

Matrix:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Then set column 1 to [3,2,1], which overwrites the first column:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Then set column 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Then set column 3 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 2 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+2+1 = 3*3 + 2*3 + 1*3 = 9 + 6 + 3 = 18.

Is this the maximum?

Alternatively, maybe there's a better arrangement.

Another approach: Set columns first.

Set column 1 to [3,2,1]

Set column 2 to [3,2,1]

Set column 3 to [3,2,1]

Then set row 1 to [3,2,1]

Set row 2 to [3,2,1]

Set row 3 to [3,2,1]

After setting columns:

Matrix:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Then set row 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

2 2 2

1 1 1

Then set row 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 1 1

Then set row 3 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum: 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 3*6 = 18.

Same sum as before.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

Let's try a different order.

Set row 1 to [3,2,1]

Set column 1 to [3,2,1]

Set row 2 to [3,2,1]

Set column 2 to [3,2,1]

Set row 3 to [3,2,1]

Set column 3 to [3,2,1]

After set row 1: [3,2,1]

Set column 1: [3,2,1], overwriting row 1, column 1 to 3:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Set row 2: [3,2,1], overwriting row 2:

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 2 1

Set column 2: [3,2,1], overwriting column 2:

3 3 1

3 2 1

1 2 1

Set row 3: [3,2,1], overwriting row 3:

3 3 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Set column 3: [3,2,1], overwriting column 3:

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 3+2+2 + 3+2+1 = 9 + 7 + 6 = 22.

Better than 18.

Is this the maximum?

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

Let me see.

Another order:

Set column 1: [3,2,1]

Set row 1: [3,2,1]

Set column 2: [3,2,1]

Set row 2: [3,2,1]

Set column 3: [3,2,1]

Set row 3: [3,2,1]

After set column 1: [3,0,0]

Set row 1: [3,2,1]

Set column 2: [3,2,1], overwriting column 2:

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Set row 2: [3,2,1], overwriting row 2:

3 3 1

3 2 1

1 2 1

Set column 3: [3,2,1], overwriting column 3:

3 3 3

3 2 2

1 2 1

Set row 3: [3,2,1], overwriting row 3:

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 3+2+2 + 3+2+1 = 9 + 7 + 6 = 22.

Same as before.

Seems consistent.

Is 22 the maximum?

Let me see if I can get higher.

Try to set rows and columns alternately, but with different permutations.

Set row 1: [3,2,1]

Set column 1: [3,2,1]

Set row 2: [1,3,2]

Set column 2: [1,3,2]

Set row 3: [2,1,3]

Set column 3: [2,1,3]

After set row 1: [3,2,1]

Set column 1: [3,2,1], overwriting column 1:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Set row 2: [1,3,2], overwriting row 2:

3 2 1

1 3 2

1 2 1

Set column 2: [1,3,2], overwriting column 2:

3 1 1

1 3 2

1 2 1

Set row 3: [2,1,3], overwriting row 3:

3 1 1

1 3 2

2 1 3

Set column 3: [2,1,3], overwriting column 3:

3 1 2

1 3 1

2 1 3

Sum: 3+1+2 + 1+3+1 + 2+1+3 = 6 + 5 + 6 = 17, which is less than 22.

So, previous approach is better.

Another try:

Set column 1: [3,2,1]

Set column 2: [3,2,1]

Set column 3: [3,2,1]

Set row 1: [3,2,1]

Set row 2: [3,2,1]

Set row 3: [3,2,1]

After set columns:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Set row 1: [3,2,1], overwriting row 1:

3 2 1

2 2 2

1 1 1

Set row 2: [3,2,1], overwriting row 2:

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 1 1

Set row 3: [3,2,1], overwriting row 3:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum: 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 6*3 = 18, which is less than 22.

So, the earlier approach is better.

Seems like 22 is the maximum for n=3.

But let's see if we can get higher.

Wait, is there a way to arrange operations to get higher sum?

Let me try a different strategy.

Suppose I set columns first with higher values on top, and then set rows with higher values on the left.

Wait, but operations overwrite, so need to think carefully.

Alternative approach: Think in terms of which operations affect which cells last.

Each cell will be set by the last operation that set its row or column.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to arrange operations such that higher values are set in cells where possible.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can think in terms of how many operations set a particular row or column.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for a pattern or formula.

Looking back at n=2, sum=7.

For n=3, sum=22.

Let's see if there's a pattern.

For n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: sum=22

Let's see the differences:

1 to 7: difference of 6

7 to 22: difference of 15

6 is 2*3, 15 is 3*5.

Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at n=2: 7 = 2*2*2 -1

Wait, not sure.

Another way: n=1: 1

n=2: 7

n=3: 22

Looking for a formula that fits these sums.

Wait, perhaps sum = n*n + (n-1)*n + (n-2)*n + ... + 1*n

Wait, for n=2: 2*2 + 1*2 = 4 + 2 = 6, but example shows 7.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps sum = n^3 / 2 or something, but for n=2, 4, which is not 7.

Wait, maybe something else.

Let me think differently.

Each operation sets a row or column to a permutation of 1 to n.

The sum of a permutation is sum from 1 to n, which is n(n+1)/2.

So, for each operation, I'm adding n(n+1)/2 to the sum, but operations overlap.

Wait, but operations overwrite, so it's not just adding up.

So, perhaps, the sum is equal to the number of operations times n(n+1)/2 minus the overlaps.

This seems too vague.

Another idea: Think about the number of operations that set each cell.

Each cell is set by the last operation that sets its row or column.

So, for each cell, its value is determined by the last operation that sets its row or column.

To maximize the sum, we need to maximize the value in each cell.

Given that, perhaps we should arrange operations so that higher values are set in cells where possible.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of the maximum value each cell can have based on the operations.

But it's getting complicated.

Looking back at the program provided, it calculates the sum as follows:

sum = 1

for i in range(2, n + 1):

sum += (i*i - (i-1)*(i-1)) * i

Let's see what this sum is for n=2 and n=3.

For n=1: sum=1, matches n=1 case.

For n=2:

sum = 1 + (4 - 1)*2 = 1 + 3*2 = 1 + 6 = 7, matches the example.

For n=3:

sum = 1 + (4 - 1)*2 + (9 - 4)*3 = 1 + 6 + 15 = 22, matches my n=3 calculation.

So, the formula seems correct.

Now, let's see what this formula represents.

sum = 1 + sum from i=2 to n of (i^2 - (i-1)^2)*i

Simplify (i^2 - (i-1)^2) = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i +1) = 2i -1

So, (2i -1)*i = 2i^2 - i

Therefore, sum = 1 + sum from i=2 to n of (2i^2 - i)

Sum from i=2 to n of 2i^2 - i = 2*sum(i^2 from 2 to n) - sum(i from 2 to n)

Sum(i^2 from 1 to n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

Sum(i from 1 to n) = n(n+1)/2

So, sum from i=2 to n of i^2 = sum from 1 to n minus 1^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 -1

Sum from i=2 to n of i = n(n+1)/2 -1

Therefore, sum = 1 + 2*(n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 -1) - (n(n+1)/2 -1)

Simplify:

= 1 + (2/3)n(n+1)(2n+1) - 2 - (n(n+1)/2 -1)

= 1 -2 +1 + (2/3)n(n+1)(2n+1) - n(n+1)/2

= 0 + n(n+1)(4n+2)/6 - n(n+1)/2

= n(n+1)/6 * (4n+2 - 3)

= n(n+1)/6 * (4n -1)

Wait, that seems messy. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler formula for the sum.

Looking back, for n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: sum=22

n=4: according to the program, sum=1 + (4-1)*2 + (9-4)*3 + (16-9)*4 = 1 + 6 + 15 + 28 = 50

Is there a pattern here?

Let's see:

n=1: 1

n=2: 7

n=3: 22

n=4: 50

Looking for a formula that fits these sums.

Wait, perhaps sum = n^3 - n + 1

For n=1: 1 -1 +1 =1, matches

n=2: 8 -2 +1=7, matches

n=3: 27 -3 +1=25, but should be 22, doesn't match.

Alternatively, sum = (n(n+1)(2n+1))/6 * something?

Wait, perhaps think in terms of the matrix sum based on operations.

Each operation adds n(n+1)/2 to the sum, but operations overlap.

Wait, perhaps think about inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the number of operations that affect each cell.

But this seems too vague.

Given that the program's formula seems to work for n=2 and n=3, and n=4, perhaps it's correct.

Now, for the operations, the program outputs n + n = 2n operations.

Specifically, it performs n type 1 operations and n type 2 operations.

Wait, looking at the code:

for j in range(1, n + 1):

print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))

print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))

So, it performs n type 1 operations and n type 2 operations, total 2n operations.

Each type 1 operation sets a row to [1,2,3,...,n]

Each type 2 operation sets a column to [1,2,3,...,n]

But in the example for n=2, they performed only 3 operations: two type 1 and one type 2, achieving sum=7.

But the program performs 4 operations for n=2: two type 1 and two type 2.

Which also achieves sum=7, as per the example.

So, it's acceptable, since m <= 2n.

Now, is this the optimal way?

In the n=2 example, they achieved sum=7 with 3 operations, but the program uses 4 operations to achieve the same sum.

Is there a problem with that?

No, because the problem allows up to 2n operations, and m <= 2n is satisfied.

Now, for n=1, the program outputs sum=1 and 1 operation, which is correct.

For n=2, sum=7 and 4 operations, which matches the example's sum and is within the limit.

For n=3, sum=22 and 6 operations, which should be correct based on my earlier calculations.

So, the program seems to be correct.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of elements in an n x n matrix using at most 2n operations, where each operation allows us to set a row or a column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Operations**:
   - Type 1 operation: Set a entire row to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - Type 2 operation: Set a entire column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   
2. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to strategically set rows and columns such that higher values are placed in as many cells as possible.
   - We can achieve this by performing operations in a specific sequence to ensure that higher values are retained in the matrix.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - We calculate the maximum possible sum using a formula derived from the pattern observed in the operations.
   - For each n, the sum is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression inside the sum:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = 2i - 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]

4. **Operations Sequence**:
   - Perform n type 1 operations (setting rows) and n type 2 operations (setting columns).
   - For each operation, use the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n].

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Explanation

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - For each test case, calculate the sum using the derived formula.
  - Print the sum and the number of operations (2n).

- **Operations**:
  - For each row and column, perform operations in a specific order to maximize the sum.
  - Use permutations [1, 2, 3, ..., n] for both row and column operations.

- **Optimal Operations**:
  - Although the example uses fewer operations to achieve the sum, using 2n operations is acceptable as per the problem constraints.

By following this approach, we ensure that the sum is maximized within the allowed operations for each test case.
