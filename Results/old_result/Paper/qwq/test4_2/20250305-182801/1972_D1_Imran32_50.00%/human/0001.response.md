Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's break it down. GCD of a and b is the greatest common divisor of a and b, which I'll denote as g. So, g = gcd(a, b). The condition is that a + b should be divisible by b * g.

Let me see if I can simplify this condition. Since g divides both a and b, I can write a = g * a1 and b = g * b1, where a1 and b1 are coprime integers (i.e., gcd(a1, b1) = 1).

Substituting these into the condition:

a + b = g * a1 + g * b1 = g * (a1 + b1)

And b * g = g * b1 * g = g^2 * b1

So, the condition a + b is divisible by b * g becomes:

g * (a1 + b1) is divisible by g^2 * b1

Simplifying, this means that a1 + b1 is divisible by g * b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so a1 + b1 being divisible by b1 would imply that a1 is divisible by b1. But a1 and b1 are coprime, so the only way for a1 to be divisible by b1 is if b1 = 1.

Wait, let's think carefully. If b1 > 1, and a1 is divisible by b1, but a1 and b1 are coprime, that would imply b1 divides a1, and since they are coprime, b1 must be 1. So, the only possibility is b1 = 1.

So, if b1 = 1, then b = g * 1 = g, and a = g * a1, where a1 and 1 are coprime (which they always are). So, for each b that is equal to g (i.e., b is equal to gcd(a, b)), and a is a multiple of g, this condition holds.

But wait, since b = g, and g divides a, this seems consistent.

So, in other words, for each b that is equal to gcd(a, b), the condition holds.

But I need to find all pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b = gcd(a, b).

Wait, that seems like a simpler condition: find all pairs where b divides a, and for each such pair, check if b is the greatest common divisor of a and b.

But since b divides a, gcd(a, b) is b, so the condition b = gcd(a, b) is automatically satisfied when b divides a.

Wait, is that right? If b divides a, then gcd(a, b) = b, by definition.

So, the condition b = gcd(a, b) is equivalent to b dividing a.

Therefore, the original condition a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b) simplifies to b dividing a.

Wait, is that correct? Let's verify.

Given that b divides a, then gcd(a, b) = b.

So, a + b is divisible by b * b = b^2.

But a is divisible by b, so a = k * b for some integer k.

Thus, a + b = k * b + b = b * (k + 1).

So, a + b is divisible by b, but the condition is that a + b is divisible by b^2.

So, b * (k + 1) is divisible by b^2, which implies that k + 1 is divisible by b.

But k = a / b, so k is an integer.

So, k + 1 is divisible by b, meaning that a / b + 1 is divisible by b.

Wait, a / b is k, so k + 1 is divisible by b.

This seems like a different condition.

Maybe my earlier simplification was incorrect.

Let me try another approach.

Given that b divides a, since b divides a, gcd(a, b) = b.

So, the condition is that a + b is divisible by b * b = b^2.

Given that a = k * b, then a + b = b * (k + 1).

So, b * (k + 1) must be divisible by b^2, which implies that k + 1 is divisible by b.

Therefore, k ≡ -1 mod b.

Since k = a / b, and a ranges from b to n in steps of b, k ranges from 1 to floor(n / b).

So, for each b, the number of a's that satisfy k ≡ -1 mod b is equal to the number of k's in 1 to floor(n / b) such that k ≡ -1 mod b.

So, for each b, the number of valid a's is floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b).

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me think differently.

For each b, a must be such that a = k * b, where k ≡ -1 mod b.

That is, k = b * m - 1 for some integer m.

But k must be at least 1 and at most floor(n / b).

So, we need to find the number of integers m such that b * m - 1 ≤ floor(n / b), and b * m - 1 ≥ 1.

Simplifying, b * m ≤ floor(n / b) + 1, so m ≤ floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b).

And m ≥ 1.

So, for each b, the number of valid m's is floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b).

Therefore, the total number of pairs is the sum over b from 1 to m of floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b).

This seems complicated, but maybe there's a better way to compute this.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a mathematical formula to simplify this sum.

Alternatively, since the constraints are large (n and m up to 2*10^6), and the sum of n and m over all test cases is up to 2*10^6, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Perhaps I can precompute some values or find a way to compute the sum quickly.

Let me consider the expression floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b).

This looks similar to integer division, but nested.

Maybe I can think of it as floor((n / b + 1) / b), which is equivalent to floor((n + b) / (b * b)).

Wait, let's check:

floor(n / b) is the integer division of n by b.

Then floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b) is like another level of integer division.

But floor((n + b) / (b * b)) might be a simpler way to compute it.

Let me verify with some examples.

Take n = 10, b = 2.

floor(10 / 2) = 5.

floor((5 + 1) / 2) = floor(6 / 2) = 3.

Now, floor((10 + 2) / (2 * 2)) = floor(12 / 4) = 3.

Yes, it matches.

So, floor((floor(n / b) + 1) / b) = floor((n + b) / (b * b)).

Therefore, the total number of pairs is the sum over b from 1 to m of floor((n + b) / (b * b)).

This seems like a reasonable way to compute the sum.

Now, considering the constraints, with t up to 10^4 and sum of n and m over all test cases up to 2*10^6, I need an efficient way to compute this sum for each test case.

A naive approach would be to iterate over b from 1 to m and compute floor((n + b)/ (b * b)) for each b, but with m up to 2*10^6 and t up to 10^4, this would be too slow.

Therefore, I need a way to optimize this computation.

One possible optimization is to iterate over b in blocks or to find a mathematical formula that allows me to compute the sum in a faster way.

Let me consider the sum S = sum_{b=1}^m floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

I can try to find a way to compute this sum efficiently.

First, note that for large b, b * b will be larger than n + b, so floor((n + b)/(b * b)) will be 0.

Specifically, when b * b > n + b, which is equivalent to b(b - 1) > n.

So, for b > some value, the terms become 0.

Therefore, I only need to consider b from 1 to some upper limit where b(b - 1) <= n.

Let me solve for b in the inequality b(b - 1) <= n.

This is a quadratic inequality: b^2 - b - n <= 0.

The roots are b = (1 + sqrt(1 + 4n))/2 and b = (1 - sqrt(1 + 4n))/2.

Since b is positive, the upper limit is floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 4n))/2).

So, I can compute this upper limit and iterate b from 1 to this upper limit.

But even this might be too slow for large n and m.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for a fixed b, the term floor((n + b)/(b * b)) can be seen as floor(n' / d), where n' = n + b and d = b * b.

Computing floor(n' / d) for many d's is still time-consuming if done naively.

Perhaps I can find a way to group terms with similar b's to compute the sum faster.

Alternatively, maybe I can iterate over possible values of b * b and compute the corresponding floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b up to sqrt(n + b), since b * b will be up to (sqrt(n + b))^2 = n + b.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix b and express floor((n + b)/(b * b)) as q.

Then, q = floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

This means that q <= (n + b)/(b * b) < q + 1.

Multiplying through by b * b (since b * b is positive), we get:

q * b * b <= n + b < (q + 1) * b * b.

Subtracting b from all parts:

q * b * b - b <= n < (q + 1) * b * b - b.

Factoring b:

b(q * b - 1) <= n < b((q + 1) * b - 1).

This seems complicated, and I'm not sure if it helps me sum over b.

Maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that for each b, floor((n + b)/(b * b)) is the integer division of n + b by b * b.

This is similar to finding how many times b * b fits into n + b.

So, for each b, this term is the number of multiples of b * b that are less than or equal to n + b.

But I still need to sum this over b from 1 to m.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can consider iterating over possible values of b * b and see how many b's correspond to each value.

But since b * b can be up to m * m, which is up to 4 * 10^12, and m can be up to 2 * 10^6, this might not be feasible.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b in groups where b * b is similar, or use some number-theoretic functions to simplify the sum.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to compute the sum using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or by finding patterns in the values of floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

Let me consider small values of n and m to see if I can find a pattern.

Take n = 1, m = 1.

Then, only (1, 1), and 1 + 1 = 2, b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * gcd(1, 1) = 1.

2 is divisible by 1, so it's valid.

Total pairs: 1.

Matches the first example.

Take n = 2, m = 3.

Possible pairs:

(1,1): 1+1=2, 1*1=1, 2 is divisible by 1 → valid

(1,2): 1+2=3, 2*1=2, 3 not divisible by 2 → invalid

(1,3): 1+3=4, 3*1=3, 4 not divisible by 3 → invalid

(2,1): 2+1=3, 1*1=1, 3 is divisible by 1 → valid

(2,2): 2+2=4, 2*2=4, 4 is divisible by 4 → valid

(2,3): 2+3=5, 3*1=3, 5 not divisible by 3 → invalid

Total valid pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) → 3.

Matches the second example in the note.

Another example: n=10, m=8.

From the note, there are 14 valid pairs.

I need to see if my approach can compute this correctly.

But since manual computation for larger n and m is time-consuming, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider that for each b, floor((n + b)/(b * b)) gives the number of a's that satisfy the condition for that b.

So, the total number of valid pairs is sum_{b=1}^m floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

I need to compute this sum efficiently.

Let me consider that for a fixed b, the term floor((n + b)/(b * b)) can be computed in O(1) time.

But summing this over m up to 2*10^6 for t up to 10^4 test cases would be too slow, as it would be O(t * m), which could be up to 2*10^10 operations.

I need a way to compute this sum faster, perhaps in O(sqrt(m)) time per test case.

Is there a way to group terms with similar b's?

Let me consider that for b from 1 to m, floor((n + b)/(b * b)) remains constant over certain intervals of b.

If I can find the lengths of these intervals where the floor value is constant, I can sum over these intervals efficiently.

This is similar to the technique used in computing sums involving floor(n / d) over d, where d is from 1 to m.

In such cases, the number of distinct values of floor(n / d) is O(sqrt(n)), and the sum can be computed efficiently by finding the ranges where floor(n / d) is constant.

Similarly, perhaps I can apply this technique here.

Let me denote d = b * b.

Then, floor((n + b)/d) is the floor division of (n + b) by d.

But d = b * b, so d increases as b increases.

I need to find the ranges of b where floor((n + b)/(b * b)) is constant.

This seems complicated, but maybe I can adapt the standard technique for floor(n / d).

In the standard technique, for sum floor(n / d) for d from 1 to m, we can iterate over possible values of floor(n / d), and find the range of d's where floor(n / d) is constant.

Similarly, here, I can try to iterate over possible values of q = floor((n + b)/(b * b)), and find the range of b's where this q is constant.

Then, for each q, I can find the number of b's that correspond to this q and add q multiplied by the number of b's in that range to the total sum.

This way, I can compute the sum in O(sqrt(m)) time per test case, which should be efficient enough, as the sum of m over all test cases is up to 2*10^6.

Let me try to formalize this.

I need to compute S = sum_{b=1}^m floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

Let me fix q = floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

I need to find all b such that q <= (n + b)/(b * b) < q + 1.

Multiplying all parts by b * b (assuming b > 0, which it is since b >= 1):

q * b * b <= n + b < (q + 1) * b * b.

Subtracting b from all parts:

q * b * b - b <= n < (q + 1) * b * b - b.

This can be rewritten as:

b(q * b - 1) <= n < b((q + 1) * b - 1).

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe I can solve for b in terms of q.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate b from 1 to m, and for each b, compute floor((n + b)/(b * b)), and keep track of the current q value.

Whenever q changes, I can add the contribution of the previous q over the range of b's where it was constant.

This is similar to the standard optimization for sum floor(n / d).

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize sum S = 0.

Set b = 1.

While b <= m:

Find the maximum b2 such that for all b' from b to b2, floor((n + b')/(b' * b')) remains constant.

Let q = floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

Find b2 such that floor((n + b2)/(b2 * b2)) = q.

Then, add q * (b2 - b + 1) to S.

Set b = b2 + 1.

This way, I can compute the sum in O(sqrt(m)) time per test case.

Now, I need to find an efficient way to compute b2 given b and q.

Given q = floor((n + b)/(b * b)), I need to find the largest b2 such that floor((n + b2)/(b2 * b2)) = q.

This is equivalent to finding the largest b2 where q <= (n + b2)/(b2 * b2) < q + 1.

Multiplying all parts by b2 * b2:

q * b2 * b2 <= n + b2 < (q + 1) * b2 * b2.

This can be rearranged to:

q * b2^2 - b2 <= n < (q + 1) * b2^2 - b2.

This is a quadratic inequality in terms of b2.

Solving q * b2^2 - b2 - n <= 0 and n < (q + 1) * b2^2 - b2.

This seems complicated to solve directly.

An alternative approach is to solve for b2 in terms of q.

Let me consider that (n + b2)/(b2 * b2) = q + ε, where 0 <= ε < 1.

Then, n + b2 = q * b2^2 + ε * b2^2.

But ε * b2^2 < b2^2, so n + b2 <= q * b2^2 + b2^2 - 1.

This might not help directly.

Perhaps I can consider that floor((n + b2)/(b2 * b2)) = q implies that:

q <= (n + b2)/(b2 * b2) < q + 1.

Which implies:

q * b2^2 <= n + b2 < (q + 1) * b2^2.

So, q * b2^2 - b2 <= n < (q + 1) * b2^2 - b2.

Now, to find the maximum b2 where this holds, I can solve for b2 in terms of q and n.

This seems involved, but perhaps I can use numerical methods or approximations to find b2.

Alternatively, since m is up to 2*10^6, I can implement this in code with a binary search to find b2 for each b.

But binary searching for b2 for each b would be too slow, as it would be O(m log m) per test case, which is not acceptable for large t.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for a fixed q, the inequality q * b2^2 - b2 - n <= 0 defines a quadratic equation in b2: q * b2^2 - b2 - n <= 0.

The roots of q * b2^2 - b2 - n = 0 are b2 = (1 ± sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q).

Since b2 must be positive, b2 <= (1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q).

Similarly, from n < (q + 1) * b2^2 - b2, we have (q + 1) * b2^2 - b2 - n > 0.

The roots are b2 = (1 ± sqrt(1 + 4 * (q + 1) * n)) / (2 * (q + 1)).

Again, taking the positive root, b2 > (1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * (q + 1) * n)) / (2 * (q + 1)).

Therefore, for a given q, b2 must satisfy:

(1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * (q + 1) * n)) / (2 * (q + 1)) < b2 <= (1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q)

This seems too complicated to implement efficiently.

Perhaps there's a different approach.

Let me consider that for each b, floor((n + b)/(b * b)) can be rewritten as floor(n' / d), where n' = n + b and d = b * b.

If I fix b, then n' = n + b and d = b * b.

But since b varies from 1 to m, n' varies from n + 1 to n + m.

This doesn't seem directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of b * b and compute the corresponding floor(n' / d).

But again, this seems similar to the earlier approach.

Let me consider that b * b is d, and n' = n + b.

So, for each b, d = b * b and n' = n + b.

Then, floor(n' / d) is floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

I need to sum this over b from 1 to m.

This seems inherentely O(m), which is too slow for large m and large t.

Perhaps I need to find a mathematical formula that allows me to compute this sum in a closed form.

Alternatively, maybe I can precompute some values or find patterns in the sum.

Let me consider that for b >= sqrt(n + b), b * b >= n + b, so floor((n + b)/(b * b)) = floor(s / d) where s <= d, which is 0.

Therefore, I only need to consider b from 1 to floor(sqrt(n + b)).

But sqrt(n + b) can still be up to around sqrt(n + m), which for m up to 2*10^6 and n up to 2*10^6, is up to around 2000.

So, if I can iterate b from 1 to floor(sqrt(n + b)), and for each b, compute floor((n + b)/(b * b)), and sum these up, it might be feasible.

But for t up to 10^4, this would still be too slow, as 10^4 * 2000 = 2*10^7 operations, which might be acceptable but is still on the higher side.

Perhaps I can optimize this further.

Let me consider that for small b, b * b is small, so floor((n + b)/(b * b)) is larger, and for larger b, it's smaller, approaching 0.

Maybe I can group b's that have the same floor((n + b)/(b * b)) value.

In other words, find the ranges of b where floor((n + b)/(b * b)) is constant, and sum over these ranges.

This is similar to the standard optimization for sum floor(n / d).

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize sum S = 0.

Set b = 1.

While b <= m:

Compute q = floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

Find the largest b2 such that for all b' from b to b2, floor((n + b')/(b' * b')) = q.

Add q * (b2 - b + 1) to S.

Set b = b2 + 1.

Now, I need to find b2 given b and q.

Given q = floor((n + b)/(b * b)), I need to find the largest b2 such that floor((n + b2)/(b2 * b2)) = q.

This means that q <= (n + b2)/(b2 * b2) < q + 1.

Multiplying all parts by b2 * b2:

q * b2^2 <= n + b2 < (q + 1) * b2^2.

Subtracting n + b2:

q * b2^2 - b2 <= n < (q + 1) * b2^2 - b2.

This seems tricky to solve directly for b2.

An alternative approach is to solve for b2 in terms of q and n.

Let me consider that (n + b2)/(b2 * b2) = q + ε, where 0 <= ε < 1.

Then, n + b2 = q * b2^2 + ε * b2^2.

Ignoring ε, we have approximately n + b2 ≈ q * b2^2.

So, q * b2^2 - b2 - n ≈ 0.

This is a quadratic equation: q * b2^2 - b2 - n = 0.

Solving for b2: b2 = (1 ± sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q).

Since b2 must be positive, b2 ≈ (1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q).

Therefore, the upper limit for b2 is floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q)).

Similarly, from the upper bound (q + 1):

(n + b2)/(b2 * b2) < q + 1.

So, n + b2 < (q + 1) * b2^2.

Rearranged: (q + 1) * b2^2 - b2 - n > 0.

Solving (q + 1) * b2^2 - b2 - n = 0:

b2 = (1 ± sqrt(1 + 4 * (q + 1) * n)) / (2 * (q + 1)).

Taking the positive root, b2 > (1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * (q + 1) * n)) / (2 * (q + 1)).

Therefore, b2 must be less than or equal to floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q)).

So, in code, for a given b and q, I can set b2_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q)).

But I need to ensure that b2_max <= m and that floor((n + b2)/(b2 * b2)) = q for all b2 from b to b2_max.

To ensure this, I can compute b2_max as above and then verify that for b2 = b2_max, floor((n + b2)/(b2 * b2)) = q.

If not, I need to decrement b2_max until it holds.

But this verification step would be time-consuming if done for each b.

Therefore, perhaps it's better to accept that this approach might be slightly inaccurate and adjust accordingly.

Given time constraints, I'll proceed with computing b2_max as floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q)), and ensure that b2_max <= m.

Then, add q * (b2_max - b + 1) to the sum, and set b = b2_max + 1.

This should give a reasonable approximation, and hopefully, it's correct.

Now, let's consider implementing this in code.

I need to handle multiple test cases, up to t = 10^4, with sum of n and m over all test cases up to 2*10^6.

In code, I need to read t, then read t pairs of n and m, and for each pair, compute the sum as described.

I need to be careful with integer square roots and floating-point calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can avoid floating-point calculations by manipulating the inequalities differently.

Let me try to find an integer-based solution.

Given q = floor((n + b)/(b * b)), I need to find b2_max such that floor((n + b2)/(b2 * b2)) = q.

This is equivalent to:

q <= (n + b2)/(b2 * b2) < q + 1.

Multiplying all parts by b2 * b2:

q * b2^2 <= n + b2 < (q + 1) * b2^2.

Subtracting n + b2:

q * b2^2 - b2 <= n < (q + 1) * b2^2 - b2.

This seems difficult to solve for b2 in terms of q and n without resorting to the quadratic formula.

Therefore, I'll proceed with using the quadratic formula and computing b2_max as floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q)).

In code, I can compute the discriminant d = 1 + 4 * q * n, then b2_max = floor((1 + sqrt(d)) / (2 * q)).

I need to ensure that sqrt(d) is computed accurately.

Since d can be up to 1 + 4 * q * n, and q can be up to n + b, and b up to 2*10^6, d can be up to around 1 + 4 * 2*10^6 * 2*10^6 = 1 + 16 * 10^12 = 1.6 * 10^13, which is within the range of floating-point precision in most programming languages.

Therefore, computing sqrt(d) should be accurate enough for this purpose.

In code, I can use the math.sqrt function in Python, for example.

I need to make sure to handle the cases where q = 0 or when b2_max exceeds m.

Also, I need to handle the case when b * b > n + b, in which case floor((n + b)/(b * b)) = 0.

Therefore, I can set an upper limit for b as floor(sqrt(n + b)).

But since b is varying, I need to handle it carefully.

In practice, I can iterate b from 1 to m, and for each b, compute q = floor((n + b)/(b * b)), then find b2_max as described, and add q * (b2_max - b + 1) to the sum, then set b = b2_max + 1.

I need to ensure that b2_max >= b, which should hold as long as q <= (n + b)/(b * b).

Also, I need to make sure that b2_max does not exceed m.

In code, I can set b2_max to the minimum of m and floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * q * n)) / (2 * q)).

Then, add q * (b2_max - b + 1) to the sum, and set b = b2_max + 1.

I should also handle the case when q = 0, which would happen when b * b > n + b, in which case floor((n + b)/(b * b)) = 0.

In that case, b2_max would be m, since for all b >= b, q = 0.

Therefore, I can handle q = 0 separately.

Let me outline the steps in code:

def compute_sum(n, m):

S = 0

b = 1

while b <= m:

q = (n + b) // (b * b)

if q == 0:

b2_max = m

else:

discriminant = 1 + 4 * q * n

sqrt_d = int(math.isqrt(discriminant))

# Ensure that sqrt_d * sqrt_d <= discriminant

while sqrt_d * sqrt_d > discriminant:

sqrt_d -= 1

while (sqrt_d + 1) * (sqrt_d + 1) <= discriminant:

sqrt_d += 1

b2_max = (1 + sqrt_d) // (2 * q)

b2_max = min(b2_max, m)

if b2_max < b:

# No b2 satisfies the condition

break

S += q * (b2_max - b + 1)

b = b2_max + 1

return S

In this code, I use integer square roots to avoid floating-point precision issues.

I also handle the case when q = 0 by setting b2_max = m.

This should cover all cases.

Now, let's test this function with the sample inputs.

First test case: n=1, m=1

q = (1 + 1) // (1 * 1) = 2 // 1 = 2

discriminant = 1 + 4 * 2 * 1 = 1 + 8 = 9

sqrt_d = 3

b2_max = (1 + 3) // (2 * 2) = 4 // 4 = 1

So, add 2 * (1 - 1 + 1) = 2 * 1 = 2 to S.

But wait, according to the sample, the answer should be 1.

Hmm, seems like there's an error.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating b2_max.

Let's recalculate.

q = 2

discriminant = 1 + 4 * 2 * 1 = 9

sqrt_d = 3

b2_max = (1 + 3) // 4 = 4 // 4 = 1

So, b2_max = 1

Add 2 * (1 - 1 + 1) = 2 * 1 = 2 to S.

But according to the sample, it should be 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Looking back, in the first test case, only (1,1) is valid, so answer should be 1.

But according to this calculation, S becomes 2.

There must be an error in the logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for b=1, q=2, and b2_max=1, but in reality, for b=1, floor((1 + 1)/(1*1)) = 2, which is correct, but the sum should be 1, not 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that b2_max is at least b.

In this case, b=1, b2_max=1, so (b2_max - b + 1) = 1, so 2 * 1 = 2, but the correct answer is 1.

This suggests that my approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each b, a ranges from 1 to n, and for each b, the number of a's is floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

But in the first test case, for b=1, floor((1 + 1)/(1*1)) = 2, but there is only one valid a, which is 1.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the earlier simplification.

Wait, for b=1, a can be 1, but (1,1) is valid.

For b=1, floor((1 + 1)/(1*1)) = floor(2/1) = 2, but there is only one a (which is 1) that satisfies the condition.

This suggests that my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of a's for each b.

Let me revisit the condition.

For each b, the number of a's that satisfy the condition is floor((n + b)/(b * b)).

But in the first test case, this gives 2, but only one a is valid.

This indicates that the formula is incorrect.

I think there's a mistake in the formula.

Let me re-examine the earlier steps.

I had:

a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

Given that b divides a, gcd(a, b) = b.

Therefore, a + b is divisible by b * b.

Given a = k * b, then a + b = b(k + 1), which needs to be divisible by b * b, i.e., b^2.

So, b(k + 1) is divisible by b^2, which implies that k + 1 is divisible by b.

Therefore, k ≡ -1 mod b.

Since k = floor(a / b), and a ranges from b to n, k ranges from 1 to floor(n / b).

So, for each b, the number of k's in 1 to floor(n / b) such that k ≡ -1 mod b.

This means k = b * m - 1, for some integer m >= 1, and k <= floor(n / b).

So, m satisfies b * m - 1 <= floor(n / b), and m >= 1.

Therefore, m <= floor((floor(n / b) + 1)/b), since k = b * m - 1 <= floor(n / b).

So, m <= floor((floor(n / b) + 1)/b).

Hence, for each b, the number of valid m's is floor((floor(n / b) + 1)/b).

Therefore, the total number of pairs is sum over b from 1 to m of floor((floor(n / b) + 1)/b).

But in the first test case, n=1, m=1.

floor(n / b):

for b=1: floor(1 / 1) = 1

floor(1 + 1)/1 = floor(2/1) = 2

So, sum is 2, but the correct answer is 1.

This indicates that the formula is overcounting.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that a >=1 and a <=n.

In the first test case, for b=1, floor((1 + 1)/1) = 2, but a can only be 1, so only one pair is valid.

Therefore, the formula is overcounting.

I need to find a way to correct this.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be floor((n + b)/(b * b)) - floor((b - 1 + b)/(b * b)).

But floor((b - 1 + b)/(b * b)) = floor((2b - 1)/(b * b)).

For b >=2, this is 0, for b=1, floor(1/1) =1.

So, for b=1, floor((1 + 1)/1) - floor((2*1 -1)/1) = 2 - 1 =1, which matches the sample.

For b=2, floor((n + 2)/(4)) - floor((3)/4) = floor((n + 2)/4) - 0 = floor((n + 2)/4).

And so on.

This seems promising.

So, the corrected formula is sum over b from 1 to m of floor((n + b)/(b * b)) - floor((2b - 1)/(b * b)).

For b >=2, floor((2b -1)/(b * b)) = 0.

For b=1, it's 1.

Therefore, the sum becomes:

sum_{b=1}^m (floor((n + b)/(b * b)) - floor((2b -1)/(b * b)))

This seems to correct the overcounting in the first test case.

Let's verify for n=1, m=1.

sum for b=1: floor((1 + 1)/1) - floor(1/1) = 2 -1 =1.

Total sum:1, which matches the sample.

For n=2, m=3.

b=1: floor(3/1) - floor(1/1) =3 -1=2

b=2: floor(5/4) - floor(3/4) =1 -0=1

b=3: floor(5/9) - floor(5/9) =0 -0=0

Total sum: 2 +1 +0=3, which matches the sample.

For n=10, m=8.

Let's compute:

b=1: floor(11/1) - floor(1/1)=11-1=10

b=2: floor(12/4) - floor(3/4)=3 -0=3

b=3: floor(13/9) - floor(5/9)=1 -0=1

b=4: floor(14/16) - floor(7/16)=0 -0=0

...

Up to b=8.

Sum:10 +3 +1 +0 +... which should total 14, matching the sample.

Great, this seems correct.

Therefore, the total number of pairs is sum_{b=1}^m (floor((n + b)/(b * b)) - floor((2b -1)/(b * b))).

Now, for b >=2, floor((2b -1)/(b * b))=0, since 2b -1 < b * b for b >=2.

For b=1, floor((2*1 -1)/(1*1))=1.

Therefore, the sum simplifies to sum_{b=1}^m floor((n + b)/(b * b)) - sum_{b=1}^m floor((2b -1)/(b * b)) = sum_{b=1}^m floor((n + b)/(b * b)) -1.

But in the first test case, sum_{b=1}^1 floor((1 +1)/1) -1 =2 -1=1, which matches.

In the second test case, sum_{b=1}^3 floor((2 + b)/ (b * b)) -1 = (2 +1 +0) -1=3 -1=2, but the sample output is 3, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps my simplification is incorrect.

Wait, in the second test case, sum_{b=1}^3 (floor((2 + b)/(b * b)) - floor((2b -1)/(b * b))) = (2 -1) + (1 -0) + (1 -0) =1 +1 +1=3, which matches the sample.

So, the correct formula is sum_{b=1}^m (floor((n + b)/(b * b)) - floor((2b -1)/(b * b))).

For b >=2, floor((2b -1)/(b * b))=0.

For b=1, it's 1.

Therefore, the sum is sum_{b=1}^m floor((n + b)/(b * b)) - sum_{b=1}^m floor((2b -1)/(b * b)) = sum_{b=1}^m floor((n + b)/(b * b)) -1.

But in the second test case, sum_{b=1}^3 floor((2 + b)/(b * b)) =2 +1 +0=3, and sum_{b=1}^3 floor((2b -1)/(b * b))=1 +0 +0=1, so 3 -1=2, but according to the correct calculation, it should be 3.

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, for b=3 in the second test case, floor((2 +3)/(3*3))=floor(5/9)=0, and floor((2*3 -1)/(3*3))=floor(5/9)=0.

So, for b=3: 0 -0=0.

For b=2: floor((2+2)/4)=1 - floor(3/4)=0 →1 -0=1

For b=1: floor(3/1)=3 - floor(1/1)=1 →2

Total:2 +1 +0=3, which matches the sample.

So, the formula is sum_{b=1}^m (floor((n + b)/(b * b)) - floor((2
