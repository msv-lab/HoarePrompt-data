Alright, I have this problem to solve. Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The goal is to determine if he can form a different rectangle from the original one, considering that rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. So, Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He makes one cut parallel to one of its sides, say parallel to the width (b), which would give him two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), where c is some integer between 1 and b-1. Alternatively, he could cut parallel to the height (a), resulting in two rectangles of size c x b and (a - c) x b.

After cutting, he has two smaller rectangles, and he can rotate and move these pieces to form a new rectangle. The question is whether he can form a rectangle that is different from the original one, where "different" means not the same as the original rectangle even after rotation.

The problem also mentions that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same. For example, a 6x4 rectangle is the same as a 4x6 rectangle.

Looking at the examples provided:

- For a 1x1 rectangle, it can't be cut into two smaller rectangles because a or b would have to be at least 2 to make a cut.

- For a 2x1 rectangle, cutting it results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

- For a 2x6 rectangle, cutting it into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

- For a 3x2 rectangle, cutting it into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.

- For a 2x2 rectangle, cutting it into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

- For a 2x4 rectangle, cutting it into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

- For a 6x3 rectangle, cutting it into two 3x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

From these examples, it seems that in some cases, you can form a different rectangle, and in some cases, you can't.

Now, I need to generalize this. Given any a and b, can I determine if it's possible to form a different rectangle after making one cut and rearranging the pieces?

Let me think about the process step by step.

1. **Cutting the rectangle:**

- Bob can cut the rectangle either parallel to the width or parallel to the height.

- If he cuts parallel to the width (b), he gets two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), where c is an integer between 1 and b-1.

- If he cuts parallel to the height (a), he gets two rectangles of size c x b and (a - c) x b, where c is an integer between 1 and a-1.

2. **Forming a new rectangle:**

- From the two smaller rectangles, Bob can rotate and move them to form a new rectangle.

- The new rectangle must have an area equal to the original rectangle's area, since no area is lost or added.

- So, the area of the new rectangle is a * b.

- The new rectangle's dimensions must be integers.

- Also, since rotations are considered the same, we only need to consider the rectangle with the smaller dimension first. For example, a 2x6 and a 6x2 are considered the same.

3. **Condition for a different rectangle:**

- The new rectangle is different from the original if its dimensions are not equal to the original dimensions or their rotation.

- In other words, if the new rectangle has dimensions c x d, it's different from the original if (c, d) != (a, b) and (c, d) != (b, a).

Given that, I need to find out if there exists a way to cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle with dimensions different from the original.

Let me consider the possible ways to cut the rectangle:

- **Cut parallel to the width (b):**

- Resulting rectangles: a x c and a x (b - c)

- Total area: a * c + a * (b - c) = a * b

- To form a new rectangle, we need to combine these two pieces.

- We can place them horizontally or vertically.

- If we place them horizontally, the new rectangle would have height a and width c + (b - c) = b, which is the same as the original.

- If we place them vertically, the new rectangle would have height a + a = 2a and width c or (b - c).

- But we can rotate the pieces.

- Similarly, if we cut parallel to the height (a), we get two rectangles of size c x b and (a - c) x b.

- Similarly, placing them vertically would give height c + (a - c) = a and width b, which is the same as the original.

- Placing them horizontally would give height c or (a - c) and width 2b.

Wait, in the example with 2x6, cutting parallel to the width:

- Cut into two 2x3 rectangles.

- Placing them horizontally: 2x(3+3)=2x6, same as original.

- Placing them vertically: (2+2)x3=4x3, which is different from the original 2x6.

- So, in this case, we can form a different rectangle.

Similarly, for 3x2:

- Cut into two 3x1 rectangles.

- Placing them horizontally: 3x(1+1)=3x2, same as original.

- Placing them vertically: (3+3)x1=6x1, which is different from the original 3x2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says for 3x2, you can form a different rectangle.

But 6x1 is different from 3x2, so yes.

Similarly, for 2x2:

- Cut into two 1x2 rectangles.

- Placing them horizontally: 1x(2+2)=1x4, which is different from the original 2x2.

- Placing them vertically: (1+1)x2=2x2, same as original.

So, in this case, you can form a different rectangle.

For 2x4:

- Cut into two 2x2 rectangles.

- Placing them horizontally: 2x(2+2)=2x4, same as original.

- Placing them vertically: (2+2)x2=4x2, which is the same as 2x4 after rotation.

So, no different rectangle is formed.

For 6x3:

- Cut into two 3x3 rectangles.

- Placing them horizontally: 3x(3+3)=3x6, same as original.

- Placing them vertically: (3+3)x3=6x3, same as original.

So, no different rectangle is formed.

From these observations, it seems that whether you can form a different rectangle depends on the dimensions after cutting and rearranging.

I need to find a general condition based on a and b.

Let me think about the possible new dimensions after rearranging the two smaller rectangles.

Suppose we cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles of sizes a x c and a x (b - c), by cutting parallel to the width.

Then, we can arrange these two rectangles in two ways:

1. Place them horizontally: forming a rectangle of size a x (c + b - c) = a x b, same as the original.

2. Place them vertically: forming a rectangle of size (a + a) x c = 2a x c.

Similarly, if we cut parallel to the height, resulting in two rectangles of size c x b and (a - c) x b, then arranging them:

1. Place them vertically: forming a rectangle of size (c + a - c) x b = a x b, same as the original.

2. Place them horizontally: forming a rectangle of size c x 2b.

Now, we need to check if any of these new rectangles (2a x c or c x 2b) are different from the original a x b, considering that rectangles that differ only by rotation are considered the same.

So, for the new rectangle to be different, it must not be equal to a x b or b x a.

Let's consider the possible new dimensions:

- 2a x c

- c x 2b

We need to check if either of these is different from a x b and b x a.

But c can be any integer from 1 to b-1 when cutting parallel to the width, or from 1 to a-1 when cutting parallel to the height.

Wait, but in the example with 2x6, cutting parallel to the width into two 2x3 rectangles, then placing them vertically gives 4x3, which is different from 2x6.

Similarly, for 3x2, cutting into two 3x1 rectangles and placing them vertically gives 6x1, which is different from 3x2.

For 2x2, cutting into two 1x2 rectangles and placing them horizontally gives 1x4, which is different from 2x2.

For 2x4, cutting into two 2x2 rectangles and placing them vertically gives 4x2, which is the same as 2x4 after rotation.

For 6x3, cutting into two 3x3 rectangles and placing them vertically gives 6x3, same as original.

So, in cases where a or b is even, we might be able to form a different rectangle, but not always.

Wait, in the 2x4 case, a=2, b=4, which are both even, but it's considered "No" in the sample output, meaning you can't form a different rectangle, but according to my earlier reasoning, cutting into two 2x2 and placing them vertically gives 4x2, which is the same as 2x4 after rotation.

Wait, but 4x2 is the same as 2x4 after rotation, so it's not different.

Hence, in this case, you can't form a different rectangle.

Similarly, for 6x3, cutting into two 3x3 and placing them vertically gives 6x3, same as original.

But for 2x6, cutting into two 2x3 and placing them vertically gives 4x3, which is different from 2x6.

So, what's the difference?

Let me see.

In the 2x6 case:

- Original rectangle: 2x6

- Cut into two 2x3 rectangles

- Placing them vertically: 4x3

- 4x3 is different from 2x6 and 6x2.

Similarly, for 3x2:

- Original rectangle: 3x2

- Cut into two 3x1 rectangles

- Placing them vertically: 6x1

- 6x1 is different from 3x2 and 2x3.

For 2x2:

- Original rectangle: 2x2

- Cut into two 1x2 rectangles

- Placing them horizontally: 1x4

- 1x4 is different from 2x2 and 2x2.

Wait, but in the sample output for 2x2, it's "Yes", meaning you can form a different rectangle.

Wait, but 1x4 is different from 2x2.

Wait, but in the sample input, for 2x2, it's "Yes".

Wait, looking back at the sample input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

So, for 2x2, it's "Yes", meaning you can form a different rectangle.

But in my earlier thought, placing the two 1x2 rectangles horizontally gives 1x4, which is different from 2x2.

Similarly, placing them vertically gives 2x2, which is the same as the original.

Hence, since 1x4 is different, it's "Yes".

Similarly, for 2x4:

- Cut into two 2x2 rectangles

- Placing them horizontally: 2x4, same as original

- Placing them vertically: 4x2, which is the same as 2x4 after rotation.

Hence, no different rectangle is formed, so "No".

For 6x3:

- Cut into two 3x3 rectangles

- Placing them horizontally: 3x6, same as original

- Placing them vertically: 6x3, same as original

Hence, "No".

For 3x2:

- Cut into two 3x1 rectangles

- Placing them horizontally: 3x2, same as original

- Placing them vertically: 6x1, which is different from 3x2

Hence, "Yes".

For 2x6:

- Cut into two 2x3 rectangles

- Placing them horizontally: 2x6, same as original

- Placing them vertically: 4x3, which is different from 2x6

Hence, "Yes".

For 1x1:

- Can't be cut, hence "No".

For 2x1:

- Cut into two 1x1 rectangles

- Placing them horizontally: 1x2

- Placing them vertically: 2x1

- Both are the same as the original, hence "No".

So, from these observations, it seems that if either a or b is even, and the rectangle can be cut in such a way that the new arrangement doesn't match the original or its rotation, then "Yes". Otherwise, "No".

But wait, in the 2x4 case, both a and b are even, but the answer is "Yes", but according to the sample output, it's "Yes", but according to my earlier thought, it should be "No". Wait, no, the sample output for 2x4 is "Yes", but according to my earlier thought, it should be "No". Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when you have a=2, b=4, cutting into two 2x2 rectangles, and placing them horizontally gives 2x4, same as original, and placing them vertically gives 4x2, which is the same as 2x4 after rotation. Hence, no different rectangle is formed. But according to the sample output, it's "Yes". So, perhaps there's another way to cut and arrange.

Wait, maybe cutting parallel to the other side.

If I cut the 2x4 rectangle parallel to the height (a=2), then:

- Cut into two c x 4 and (2 - c) x 4 rectangles.

- Placing them vertically: (c + 2 - c) x 4 = 2x4, same as original.

- Placing them horizontally: c x 8 and (2 - c) x 8, but that doesn't make sense because you have two separate rectangles.

Wait, no. When you cut parallel to the height, you get two rectangles of size c x b and (a - c) x b.

Then, when arranging them, you can place them either vertically or horizontally.

- Vertically: (c + a - c) x b = a x b, same as original.

- Horizontally: max(c, a - c) x 2b.

Wait, but in the 2x4 case, cutting parallel to the height (a=2):

- Cut into two c x 4 and (2 - c) x 4.

- Placing them vertically: 2x4, same as original.

- Placing them horizontally: max(c, 2 - c) x 8.

- If c=1, then it's 1x8.

- But 1x8 is different from 2x4 and 4x2.

Hence, in this case, you can form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4, so it should be "Yes".

But in the sample input, for a=2, b=4, the output is "Yes".

Wait, but earlier I thought it was "No", but according to the sample output, it's "Yes".

So, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier thought.

So, for a=2, b=4:

- Cut parallel to width: two 2x2 rectangles, placing vertically gives 4x2, which is the same as 2x4 after rotation.

- Cut parallel to height: two 1x4 rectangles, placing horizontally gives 1x8, which is different from 2x4.

Hence, "Yes".

Similarly, for a=6, b=3:

- Cut parallel to width: two 6x1.5, but since dimensions are integers, it's two 6x1 and 6x2, but wait, dimensions are integers, so c must be integer.

Wait, a=6, b=3, cutting parallel to width (b=3):

- Cut into two 6x1 and 6x2.

- Placing them vertically: 6x3, same as original.

- Placing them horizontally: 6x3, same as original.

Wait, no.

Wait, placing them horizontally: 6x(1+2)=6x3, same as original.

Placing them vertically: (6+6)x1 or (6+6)x2, which is 12x1 or 12x2.

- 12x1 is different from 6x3 and 3x6.

- 12x2 is different from 6x3 and 3x6.

But according to the sample input, for a=6, b=3, the output is "No".

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the problem statement, for a=6, b=3, it's "No".

But according to my earlier thought, cutting parallel to the width into two 6x1 and 6x2, and placing them vertically gives 12x1 or 12x2, which are different from 6x3.

But the sample output is "No", meaning you can't form a different rectangle.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the two pieces must be used together to form a new rectangle.

So, when you have two pieces of 6x1 and 6x2, you can't combine them to form a rectangle of 12x1 or 12x2 directly. You need to arrange them in such a way that they form a single rectangle.

But 6x1 and 6x2 have areas of 6 and 12, respectively, and together their area is 18, which is the same as the original 6x3=18.

But to form a rectangle from these two pieces, you need to arrange them in a way that their combined shape forms a rectangle.

But in this case, you can't arrange a 6x1 and a 6x2 to form a 12x1 or 12x2 rectangle.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me try to visualize it.

If I have a 6x1 rectangle and a 6x2 rectangle, and I place them side by side horizontally, I get a shape that is 6x3, same as the original.

If I place them vertically, I get a shape that is 12x1.

But a 12x1 rectangle would require the two pieces to be stacked on top of each other, but their widths are different, so they won't form a perfect rectangle.

Wait, no. If I have a 6x1 and a 6x2, and I place them vertically, one on top of the other, the total height would be 6+6=12, and the width would be max(1,2)=2, so it would be a 12x2 rectangle.

But wait, the 6x1 piece would only cover part of the width, and the 6x2 piece would cover more. So, the combined shape wouldn't be a rectangle unless the widths match.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

If I have two rectangles of different widths, I can't simply stack them vertically to form a rectangle unless their widths are the same.

Similarly, placing them horizontally would require their heights to be the same.

So, in this case, with a 6x1 and a 6x2, I can't form a rectangle that is 12x1 or 12x2, because the widths don't match.

Hence, you can't form a new rectangle from these two pieces.

Therefore, for a=6, b=3, it's "No".

Similarly, for a=2, b=4:

- Cutting parallel to width: two 2x2 rectangles, which can be placed vertically to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x4 after rotation.

- Cutting parallel to height: two 1x4 rectangles, which can be placed vertically to form a 2x4, same as original, or horizontally to form a 1x8, which is different from the original.

Wait, but can two 1x4 rectangles form a 1x8 rectangle?

Yes, by placing them horizontally side by side.

Hence, in this case, you can form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4, so it's "Yes".

But in the a=6, b=3 case, cutting into two 6x1 and 6x2, you can't form a new rectangle, so it's "No".

Hence, the general approach seems to be:

- After cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles, check if there's a way to arrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering rotations.

- To form a new rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must be arrangeable (either by placing them horizontally or vertically) to form a rectangle with integer dimensions, and this new rectangle should not be the same as the original or its rotation.

Now, to generalize this, I need to find a condition based on a and b that allows me to determine if such an arrangement is possible.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- 1 1: No

- 2 1: No

- 2 6: Yes

- 3 2: Yes

- 2 2: Yes

- 2 4: Yes

- 6 3: No

Looking for a pattern:

Looking at a and b:

- If both a and b are odd: No

- If one is even and the other is odd: No

- If both are even: Yes

Wait, but in the sample input, for a=2, b=2: Yes

a=2, b=4: Yes

a=2, b=6: Yes

a=3, b=2: Yes

a=6, b=3: No

a=2, b=1: No

a=1, b=1: No

So, it's not just about both being even.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is greater than 1.

Wait, for a=2, b=2: GCD=2, Yes

a=2, b=4: GCD=2, Yes

a=2, b=6: GCD=2, Yes

a=3, b=2: GCD=1, Yes

a=6, b=3: GCD=3, No

a=2, b=1: GCD=1, No

a=1, b=1: GCD=1, No

Hmm, doesn't seem consistent.

Wait, maybe it's about whether a*b is divisible by 4.

- a=2, b=2: 4, Yes

- a=2, b=4: 8, Yes

- a=2, b=6: 12, Yes

- a=3, b=2: 6, No

- a=6, b=3: 18, No

- a=2, b=1: 2, No

- a=1, b=1: 1, No

But according to the sample input, for a=3, b=2, it's "Yes", but according to this, it's "No".

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a or b is even.

- If at least one of a or b is even: Yes

- If both are odd: No

But in the sample input, for a=3, b=2: Yes (a is odd, b is even)

a=6, b=3: No (a is even, b is odd)

a=2, b=1: No (a is even, b is odd)

a=1, b=1: No (both odd)

a=2, b=2: Yes (both even)

a=2, b=4: Yes (both even)

a=2, b=6: Yes (both even)

Wait, this doesn't match the sample input.

Wait, in the sample input, for a=3, b=2: Yes (a is odd, b is even)

a=6, b=3: No (a is even, b is odd)

So, it's not just about whether at least one is even.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2, but not both being odd.

But in the sample input, for a=3, b=2: Yes

a=6, b=3: No

So, maybe it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2, but not both being odd, but there are exceptions.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2 and a*b is divisible by 4.

- a=3, b=2: a*b=6, not divisible by 4, but sample output is "Yes"

- a=6, b=3: a*b=18, not divisible by 4, sample output is "No"

Wait, inconsistent again.

Wait, maybe it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2, and a != b.

But a=2, b=2: a=b, both even, output is "Yes"

a=2, b=1: a != b, a is even, b is odd, output is "No"

Wait, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a and b have different parities.

- a=3, b=2: different parities, output "Yes"

- a=6, b=3: different parities, output "No"

- a=2, b=1: different parities, output "No"

- a=1, b=1: both odd, output "No"

- a=2, b=2: both even, output "Yes"

- a=2, b=4: both even, output "Yes"

- a=2, b=6: both even, output "Yes"

So, perhaps it's "Yes" if both are even, or if one is even and the other is odd, but not both odd.

But in the sample input, for a=3, b=2: one even, one odd, output "Yes"

for a=6, b=3: one even, one odd, output "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both even, or one is even and the other is odd, but a is not a multiple of b or vice versa.

But a=3, b=2: one even, one odd, and neither is a multiple of the other, output "Yes"

a=6, b=3: one even, one odd, and a is a multiple of b, output "No"

So, perhaps if one dimension is a multiple of the other and one is even, then "No"

Wait, in a=6, b=3: a is a multiple of b, and a is even, output "No"

a=3, b=2: a is not a multiple of b, and b is even, output "Yes"

a=2, b=1: a is a multiple of b, and a is even, output "No"

a=1, b=1: both odd, output "No"

a=2, b=2: a is a multiple of b, both even, output "Yes"

a=2, b=4: a is a multiple of b, both even, output "Yes"

a=2, b=6: a is a multiple of b, both even, output "Yes"

Wait, this seems to suggest that if a is a multiple of b or b is a multiple of a, then:

- If a and b are both even, output "Yes"

- If one is even and the other is odd, output "No"

But in the a=2, b=2 case, a is a multiple of b, both even, output "Yes"

a=2, b=4: a is a multiple of b, both even, output "Yes"

a=2, b=6: a is a multiple of b, both even, output "Yes"

a=6, b=3: a is a multiple of b, a is even, b is odd, output "No"

a=3, b=2: a is not a multiple of b, a is odd, b is even, output "Yes"

a=2, b=1: a is a multiple of b, a is even, b is odd, output "No"

a=1, b=1: both odd, output "No"

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If both a and b are even, then "Yes"

- Else, if one is even and the other is odd, and a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

But in the a=3, b=2 case, one is even, one is odd, and a is not a multiple of b, output "Yes"

In the a=2, b=1 case, one is even, one is odd, and a is a multiple of b, output "No"

So, perhaps more precisely:

- If both a and b are even, "Yes"

- Else, if one is even and the other is odd, and the even one is not a multiple of the odd one, "Yes"

- Else, "No"

Let me test this with the sample inputs:

- a=1, b=1: both odd, "No"

- a=2, b=1: one even, one odd, but a is a multiple of b, "No"

- a=2, b=6: both even, "Yes"

- a=3, b=2: one even, one odd, and a is not a multiple of b, "Yes"

- a=2, b=2: both even, "Yes"

- a=2, b=4: both even, "Yes"

- a=6, b=3: one even, one odd, and a is a multiple of b, "No"

This matches the sample outputs.

Hence, this seems to be a correct condition.

So, the condition for "Yes" is:

- Both a and b are even, or

- One is even and the other is odd, and the even one is not a multiple of the odd one.

Otherwise, "No"

Wait, but in the a=3, b=2 case, 2 is even, 3 is odd, and 2 is not a multiple of 3, so "Yes"

In the a=2, b=1 case, 2 is even, 1 is odd, and 2 is a multiple of 1, so "No"

In the a=6, b=3 case, 6 is even, 3 is odd, and 6 is a multiple of 3, so "No"

In the a=2, b=2 case, both even, "Yes"

In the a=2, b=4 case, both even, "Yes"

In the a=2, b=6 case, both even, "Yes"

In the a=1, b=1 case, both odd, "No"

This matches the sample outputs.

Hence, this condition seems correct.

Now, to implement this in code, I need to check:

- If both a and b are even, output "Yes"

- Else, if one is even and the other is odd, and the even one is not a multiple of the odd one, output "Yes"

- Else, output "No"

But in the code provided, it seems to have a different condition.

Looking at the given code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:

print('NO')

elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

So, the code checks:

- If both a and b are odd, print 'NO'

- Else, if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a, print 'NO'

- Else, print 'YES'

Now, comparing this with the condition I derived:

- Both a and b are even: 'Yes'

- One is even, one is odd, and the even one is not a multiple of the odd one: 'Yes'

- Else: 'No'

In the code:

- If both are odd: 'NO' (matches)

- Else, if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a: 'NO'

- Else: 'YES'

So, the condition a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a corresponds to the case where one dimension is twice the other dimension.

In other words, when a = 2b or b = 2a.

Now, in the sample inputs:

- a=6, b=3: a = 2b, so 'NO'

- a=3, b=2: neither a = 2b nor b = 2a, so 'YES'

- a=2, b=1: a = 2b, so 'NO'

- a=2, b=2: neither a = 2b nor b = 2a, so 'YES'

- a=2, b=4: a = 2b, so 'NO'

- a=2, b=6: b = 3a, which is not 2a, so 'YES'

Wait, but according to the sample input, for a=2, b=4: output is "Yes", but according to this condition, a = 2b, so 'NO'

Wait, but in the sample input, for a=2, b=4: output is "Yes"

But according to this code, it should be 'NO', which contradicts the sample output.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Looking back:

Sample Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Sample Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

So, for a=2, b=4: output is "Yes", but according to the code, it would be 'NO' because a / 2 == b (2 / 2 == 1 != 4), wait, no.

Wait, a=2, b=4:

a / 2 = 1 != b=4

b / 2 = 2 == a=2, so b / 2 == a, so 'NO'

But according to the sample output, it's "Yes"

Hence, the code seems to be incorrect for this case.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, for a=2, b=4:

- Both even, so 'Yes'

But according to the code:

- Both even, but since b / 2 == a, it prints 'NO'

Which contradicts the sample output.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier reasoning, I thought that for both even, it should be 'Yes', unless a is a multiple of b or vice versa, but in this case, a=2, b=4, a is a multiple of b, so perhaps 'No'

Wait, hold on.

In my earlier condition, I had:

- Both a and b are even: 'Yes'

- One is even, one is odd, and the even one is not a multiple of the odd one: 'Yes'

- Else: 'No'

But in the a=2, b=4 case, both are even, so it should be 'Yes', but according to the code, since b / 2 == a, it prints 'NO'

But according to the sample output, it's "Yes"

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to revisit my condition.

Wait, perhaps for both even, and one is a multiple of the other, it's 'No'

Wait, in a=2, b=4: both even, and a is a multiple of b, so 'No'

a=2, b=6: both even, a is a multiple of b, but according to sample output, "Yes"

Wait, hold on.

Wait, a=2, b=6: a is a multiple of b? No, b is a multiple of a.

Wait, a=2, b=6: b is a multiple of a, since 6 is a multiple of 2.

Wait, perhaps if one is a multiple of the other, and both are even, it's 'No'

Wait, but in the sample input, for a=2, b=6: "Yes"

a=2, b=4: "Yes"

a=6, b=3: "No"

Wait, perhaps it's 'Yes' if both are even and neither is a multiple of the other.

Wait, a=2, b=6: 6 is a multiple of 2, so 'No'

a=2, b=4: 4 is a multiple of 2, so 'No'

a=2, b=2: neither is a multiple of the other (since multiples are considered only if one is strictly larger), so 'Yes'

But in the sample input, for a=2, b=4: "Yes"

Wait, maybe my condition is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps it's 'Yes' unless:

- Both are even and a = 2b or b = 2a

- Or both are odd

- Or one is even, one is odd, and a is a multiple of b or b is a multiple of a

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- a=1, b=1: both odd, "No"

- a=2, b=1: one even, one odd, a is a multiple of b, "No"

- a=2, b=6: both even, b is a multiple of a, "Yes"

- a=3, b=2: one even, one odd, a is not a multiple of b, "Yes"

- a=2, b=2: both even, "Yes"

- a=2, b=4: both even, b is a multiple of a, "Yes"

- a=6, b=3: one even, one odd, a is a multiple of b, "No"

Wait, so in the a=2, b=6 case, both even, b is a multiple of a, but output is "Yes"

a=2, b=4: both even, b is a multiple of a, output is "Yes"

a=6, b=3: one even, one odd, a is a multiple of b, output is "No"

a=2, b=1: one even, one odd, a is a multiple of b, output is "No"

a=1, b=1: both odd, output is "No"

a=2, b=2: both even, "Yes"

a=3, b=2: one even, one odd, a is not a multiple of b, "Yes"

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If both are even, "Yes"

- Else, if one is even and the other is odd, and a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, "Yes"

- Else, "No"

In the a=2, b=4 case, both even, "Yes"

In the a=6, b=3 case, one even, one odd, and a is a multiple of b, "No"

In the a=3, b=2 case, one even, one odd, a is not a multiple of b, "Yes"

In the a=2, b=1 case, one even, one odd, a is a multiple of b, "No"

In the a=1, b=1 case, both odd, "No"

In the a=2, b=2 case, both even, "Yes"

In the a=2, b=6 case, both even, "Yes"

Hence, this condition seems to match the sample outputs.

Now, in the given code:

- If both are odd: 'NO'

- Else, if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a: 'NO'

- Else: 'YES'

So, in the a=2, b=4 case:

- Both even, but b / 2 == a, so 'NO'

But according to the condition above, it should be 'Yes'

Hence, the code is incorrect for this case.

Wait, but according to the sample output for a=2, b=4: "Yes", but the code would output 'NO', which is incorrect.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
