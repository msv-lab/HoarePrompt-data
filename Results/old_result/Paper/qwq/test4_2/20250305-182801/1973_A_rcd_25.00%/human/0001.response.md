Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are three friends playing chess together, and in each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if such a scenario is impossible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's possible in terms of points distribution. Each game can either have a winner and a loser, or it can be a draw. So, in each game, the total points awarded are either 2 (if one player wins) or 2 (if it's a draw, 1+1=2). So, regardless of whether a game is won or drawn, 2 points are added to the total pool of points.

Given that, the sum of p1 + p2 + p3 must be even because each game contributes 2 points to the total. So, if p1 + p2 + p3 is odd, it's impossible, and we should return -1. That makes sense.

Looking at the first test case: 0 0 0. No games were played, so no draws, which matches the output of 0.

Second test case: 0 1 1. The sum is 2, which is even. The output is 1, meaning there was one draw between two players.

Third test case: 1 1 1. The sum is 3, which is odd, so it's impossible, hence -1.

Fourth test case: 1 1 2. Sum is 4, which is even. Output is 2, which suggests two draws or a combination of wins and draws.

Fifth test case: 3 3 3. Sum is 9, which is odd, so impossible, output -1.

Sixth test case: 3 4 5. Sum is 12, which is even. Output is 6, which seems high, but maybe there were multiple draws.

Seventh test case: 1 1 10. Sum is 12, which is even. Output is 2.

So, the program needs to calculate the maximum number of draws possible given the constraints.

Let's think about how to approach this.

First, as established, if the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd, it's impossible, so return -1.

Assuming the sum is even, we need to maximize the number of draws.

Each draw involves two players and adds 1 point to each player's score.

Each win involves two players and adds 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.

Given that, to maximize draws, we should minimize the number of wins.

But we have to reach the given scores.

Let's consider that the total number of games played is equal to half the sum of points, since each game adds 2 points to the total pool.

So, total games = (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

Out of these games, some are draws and some are wins.

Let’s denote:

- d = number of draws

- w = number of wins

Then, d + w = total games.

And the points distributed would be:

- For each draw: both players get 1 point, so total points from draws: 2d

- For each win: winner gets 2 points, loser gets 0, so total points from wins: 2w

So, total points: 2d + 2w = 2(d + w) = p1 + p2 + p3, which checks out.

But this doesn't directly help me maximize d.

I need to consider how the points are distributed among the three players.

Let me consider the possible pairs of players who can play against each other.

There are three possible pairs:

- Player 1 vs Player 2

- Player 1 vs Player 3

- Player 2 vs Player 3

Each pair can play multiple games, which can be wins or draws.

I need to assign a number of wins and draws to each pair in such a way that the total points for each player match p1, p2, and p3.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the maximum number of draws.

Each draw involves two players, and adds 1 point to each.

To maximize draws, I need to maximize the number of times two players draw against each other.

But I have to ensure that the total points for each player match p1, p2, and p3.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is limited by the smallest score among the players, since each draw adds 1 point to two players.

Wait, but if one player has a higher score, it might be because they have more wins.

Let me try to model this.

Let’s denote:

- d12: number of draws between player 1 and player 2

- d13: number of draws between player 1 and player 3

- d23: number of draws between player 2 and player 3

- w12: number of wins by player 1 over player 2

- w13: number of wins by player 1 over player 3

- w21: number of wins by player 2 over player 1

- w23: number of wins by player 2 over player 3

- w31: number of wins by player 3 over player 1

- w32: number of wins by player 3 over player 2

But this seems too many variables.

Maybe I can simplify.

Since the players' scores are ordered p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, perhaps I can make some assumptions based on that.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider that the total points from draws is 2d, since each draw adds 2 points to the total pool.

The total points from wins is 2w, since each win adds 2 points to the winner.

So, p1 + p2 + p3 = 2(d + w)

Therefore, d + w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Our goal is to maximize d, so we need to minimize w.

But w is the number of wins, which are needed to account for the differences in scores.

In other words, wins are necessary when one player needs to gain more points than the other.

So, to minimize w, we need to maximize d, which means having as many draws as possible.

But we have to ensure that the individual scores are met.

Let’s consider that the sum of points is even, so it's possible.

Now, to maximize d, we need to have as many draws as possible, but we have to distribute the points correctly.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is the minimum of p1, p2, and p3, because each draw increases two players' scores by 1.

But that might not be accurate, because p3 could be higher.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the total points from draws are 2d, and the points from wins are 2w, with w being the number of wins.

But I need to relate this to the individual scores.

Let me consider that the difference between the highest and the lowest score is due to wins.

If p3 is much higher than p1, it must be because p3 has more wins over p1 and p2.

But I need a systematic way to calculate this.

Maybe I can think in terms of the total number of wins needed to account for the differences in scores.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the total points from wins is p3 - p1, assuming that p3 has won enough games to have p3 - p1 more points than p1.

But this seems too simplistic.

Let me look for invariants or necessary conditions.

One thing is that the sum of points must be even, as established.

Another is that no player can have negative points.

Also, since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, p3 cannot be less than p2 or p1.

Moreover, p3 cannot be more than p1 + p2, because otherwise, p3 would have more points than the other two could possibly give him through wins and draws.

Wait, actually, p3 could be up to p1 + p2 if all games involving p3 are wins for p3.

Wait, no, if p3 wins all games against p1 and p2, then p3 could have up to 2 times the number of games played against p1 and p2.

But this is getting complicated.

Let me think about the maximum possible draws.

If all games are draws, then each draw involves two players, and each player gets 1 point.

So, if there are d draws, then the total points would be 2d.

But in reality, the total points are p1 + p2 + p3, which must be equal to 2(d + w), as before.

But I need to maximize d, so I need to see what the maximum d can be such that the individual scores can be achieved.

Perhaps I can model this with equations.

Let’s denote:

- d12: number of draws between player 1 and player 2

- d13: number of draws between player 1 and player 3

- d23: number of draws between player 2 and player 3

- w12: number of wins by player 1 over player 2

- w13: number of wins by player 1 over player 3

- w23: number of wins by player 2 over player 3

Then, the points for each player are:

p1 = d12 + d13 + 2(w12 + w13)

p2 = d12 + d23 + 2(w23 + w21)

p3 = d13 + d23 + 2(w31 + w32)

Where w21 is the number of wins by player 2 over player 1, which is equal to w12, but actually, w21 is the number of times player 2 won against player 1, which is different from w12.

Wait, no, w12 is the number of times player 1 won against player 2, and w21 is the number of times player 2 won against player 1.

So, w12 + w21 is the number of wins between player 1 and player 2.

But this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I can consider that for each pair, the number of draws is d12, d13, d23, and the number of wins is w12, w13, w23 respectively.

Then, p1 = d12 + d13 + 2(w12 + w13)

p2 = d12 + d23 + 2(w23 + w21)

p3 = d13 + d23 + 2(w31 + w32)

But I don't know w21, w31, w32 in terms of the variables I have.

This seems messy.

Is there a better way to approach this?

Let me consider that the total number of draws is d = d12 + d13 + d23

And the total number of wins is w = w12 + w13 + w23

And we have p1 + p2 + p3 = 2(d + w)

As before.

Now, to maximize d, I need to maximize the number of draws, which means minimizing the number of wins.

So, I need to see what is the minimal number of wins required to achieve the given scores.

Let me think about the differences in scores.

Since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, the differences p2 - p1 and p3 - p2 represent how much higher p2 and p3 are compared to p1 and p2, respectively.

These differences must be achieved through wins.

Each win gives a difference of 2 points (winner gets 2, loser gets 0).

So, the minimal number of wins needed is ceil((p3 - p1)/2), because p3 needs to be at least p1 + 2*w, where w is the number of wins p3 has over p1 and p2.

Wait, but it's more complicated than that because p2 is in between.

Let me try to find expressions for the minimal number of wins.

Suppose that p3 has some wins over p1 and p2, and p2 has some wins over p1.

Let me denote:

- w3: number of wins p3 has over p1 and p2

- w2: number of wins p2 has over p1

- w1: number of wins p1 has over p2 and p3

Then, the points can be expressed as:

p1 = d12 + d13 + 2*w1

p2 = d12 + d23 + 2*w2

p3 = d13 + d23 + 2*w3

But this still seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let’s consider that the sum of points is 2(d + w), and we need to maximize d.

So, d_max = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w_min

Where w_min is the minimal number of wins needed to achieve the score differences.

So, I need to find w_min.

How can I find w_min?

w_min is determined by the differences in scores that must be achieved through wins.

Since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, p3 must have won some games against p1 and/or p2 to have a higher score.

Similarly, p2 may have won some games against p1.

So, the minimal number of wins is the number of times players had to win to account for the differences in scores.

Let me consider that the difference between p3 and p1 must be accounted for by wins, since draws don't create differences.

So, p3 - p1 must be equal to 2*w3, where w3 is the number of wins p3 has over p1 and p2.

Wait, but p3 can also have draws against p1 and p2, which would increase p3's score by 1 per draw.

Wait, no, draws involve two players, so a draw between p3 and p1 would increase both p3 and p1 by 1.

But p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, so p3 can have more wins over p1 and p2 to increase its score.

This is getting too tangled.

Maybe I should look for necessary conditions.

One necessary condition is that p3 ≤ p1 + p2, because p3 can only gain points from playing against p1 and p2.

If p3 > p1 + p2, it's impossible, so we should return -1 in that case.

Wait, is that always true?

Let me check.

Suppose p1 = 0, p2 = 0, p3 = 0. This is possible with 0 games, which is allowed.

p1 = 0, p2 = 0, p3 = 1. This is impossible because p3 cannot have points without p1 or p2 having some points from draws or losses.

Wait, but if p3 wins against p1, p3 gets 2 and p1 gets 0, so p1=0, p2=0, p3=2 is possible.

But in this case, p3 = 2 > p1 + p2 = 0, which violates p3 ≤ p1 + p2.

So, in this case, p3 cannot be greater than p1 + p2.

Wait, but in the earlier test case, p1=1, p2=1, p3=10, which sums to 12, which is even, but p3=10 > p1 + p2=2, which seems impossible.

But according to the example, the output is 2, which means it's possible.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that p3 can be up to p1 + p2 + 2*k, where k is the number of wins p3 has over p1 and p2.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look back at the example where p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

Sum is 12, which is even.

According to the output, it's possible with 2 draws.

So, perhaps p3 can have points from wins and draws.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that p3 can play against p1 and p2 separately.

Let’s assume p3 plays only against p1:

- Each win gives p3 +2 and p1 +0

- Each draw gives p3 +1 and p1 +1

Similarly, p3 plays only against p2:

- Each win gives p3 +2 and p2 +0

- Each draw gives p3 +1 and p2 +1

Similarly, p1 and p2 can play against each other:

- Each win: winner +2, loser +0

- Each draw: both +1

But this seems too vague to derive a general formula.

Maybe I need to consider the total points and the minimal number of wins required.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose that all games are draws.

Then, p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*d, where d is the number of draws.

But in reality, p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*(d + w), where w is the number of wins.

So, to maximize d, I need to minimize w.

The minimal w is the minimal number of wins needed to account for the differences in scores.

So, perhaps w_min is the sum of the differences between p3 and p2, and p2 and p1, divided by 2.

Wait, but that might not be accurate.

Let me consider that p3 can have wins over p1 and p2, and p2 can have wins over p1.

So, the differences p3 - p2 and p2 - p1 must be accounted for by wins.

But draws contribute equally to both players involved.

So, to maximize draws, I need to maximize the points that are achieved through draws, which add 1 to each player's score.

But p3 has the highest score, so it might have some wins.

Let me try to find expressions for the minimal number of wins.

Suppose that p3 has w3 wins over p1 and p2 combined, and p2 has w2 wins over p1.

Then:

p3 = d3 + 2*w3

p2 = d2 + 2*w2

p1 = d1 + 2*w1

But I need to relate d1, d2, d3 to the draws between the players.

This seems too abstract.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the total points from draws is d, where d is the sum of draws between all pairs.

Wait, but each draw involves two players, so it adds 1 to each player's score.

So, if there are d draws in total, then the total points from draws is 2*d.

Similarly, the points from wins are 2*w.

So, p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*(d + w)

Which is consistent with what I had before.

Now, to maximize d, I need to minimize w.

So, w_min = (p3 - p1)/2, assuming that p3 can have wins over p1 and p2 to make up the difference.

But this might not be accurate.

Let me consider that p3 can have wins over p1 and p2, and p2 can have wins over p1.

So, the minimal number of wins is the number of times p3 needs to win over p1 and p2 to make up p3 - p2, and p2 needs to win over p1 to make up p2 - p1.

So, w_min = ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2)

But since p3 - p2 and p2 - p1 are both non-negative, and points are integers, I can use integer division.

So, w_min = ceil((p3 - p2)/2) + ceil((p2 - p1)/2)

But in programming, to implement ceil division, I can use (a + b - 1) // b.

But since p3 - p2 and p2 - p1 are non-negative integers, I can write:

w_min = ((p3 - p2) + 1)//2 + ((p2 - p1) + 1)//2

Wait, but if p3 - p2 is even, ceil((p3 - p2)/2) = (p3 - p2)/2

If p3 - p2 is odd, ceil((p3 - p2)/2) = (p3 - p2 + 1)/2

Similarly for p2 - p1.

So, w_min = ((p3 - p2) + 1)//2 + ((p2 - p1) + 1)//2

Then, d_max = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - w_min

But I need to ensure that d_max is non-negative.

If d_max is negative, it's impossible.

Otherwise, d_max is the maximum number of draws.

But I need to verify this.

Let me test this with the example inputs.

First test case: 0 0 0

Sum is 0, which is even.

w_min = ((0 - 0) + 1)//2 + ((0 - 0) + 1)//2 = 0 + 0 = 0

d_max = (0 + 0 + 0)/2 - 0 = 0 - 0 = 0, which matches the output.

Second test case: 0 1 1

Sum is 2, which is even.

w_min = ((1 - 1) + 1)//2 + ((1 - 0) + 1)//2 = 0 + 1 = 1

d_max = (0 + 1 + 1)/2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0

But the output is 1, which doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.

Let me try another approach.

Let’s consider that the total number of draws is d, and the total number of wins is w, with d + w = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2.

Each draw increases two players' scores by 1, and each win increases one player's score by 2.

So, the sum of the scores is 2d + 2w.

But I need to maximize d, which is equivalent to minimizing w.

To minimize w, I need to maximize the points achieved through draws.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total sum and increases two players' scores by 1.

So, to maximize d, I need to make sure that the individual scores can be achieved with as many draws as possible.

Let’s consider that the minimal number of wins is determined by the differences in scores that cannot be achieved through draws.

So, the minimal number of wins is the sum of the differences between the highest and the lowest scores, divided by 2.

Wait, but that's not precise.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose that p3 has p3 points, p2 has p2 points, and p1 has p1 points.

To maximize draws, I need to have as many draws as possible.

But p3 cannot have more points than the sum of p1 and p2, because p3 can only gain points from playing against p1 and p2.

So, if p3 > p1 + p2, it's impossible.

Wait, but in the example, p1=1, p2=1, p3=10, sum is 12, which is even, and p3=10 > p1 + p2=2, but the output is 2, which suggests it's possible.

So, my earlier assumption that p3 ≤ p1 + p2 is necessary is incorrect.

Wait, maybe p3 can have wins over p1 and p2 separately.

Let’s see: if p3 plays against p1 and wins some games, and plays against p2 and wins some games, p3 can accumulate more points than p1 + p2.

Wait, no, because p1 and p2 can also play against each other and have draws or wins, which affects their points.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a formula or a way to calculate d_max directly.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to handle different cases.

Let me try to understand the code.

The function reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, reads p1, p2, p3.

First, it checks if the sum of p1, p2, p3 is odd. If so, it's impossible, so prints -1.

Then, if p3 >= p1 + p2, it prints p1 + p2.

Else, it calculates low and high based on p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and iterates to find the maximum number of draws.

This seems like a specific implementation, but I need to verify if it's correct.

Looking back at the examples:

Test case 4: 1 1 2

Sum is 4, which is even.

p3 = 2 >= p1 + p2 = 2, so it prints p1 + p2 = 2, which matches the output.

Test case 7: 1 1 10

Sum is 12, which is even.

p3 = 10 >= p1 + p2 = 2, so it prints p1 + p2 = 2, which matches the output.

But earlier I thought that p3 cannot be greater than p1 + p2, but in this approach, if p3 >= p1 + p2, it prints p1 + p2.

Is this correct?

Wait, if p3 >= p1 + p2, does that mean that p3 can have wins over p1 and p2 to accumulate up to p3 points, and the maximum draws are p1 + p2?

In the test case 1 1 2:

p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 2

Possible scenario:

- p3 plays against p1: p3 wins once, p1 loses: p3 = 2, p1 = 0

- p3 plays against p2: p3 wins once, p2 loses: p3 = 4, p2 = 0

But p1 and p2 have 0 points, which doesn't match the required p1=1, p2=1.

Wait, so maybe there need to be draws involved.

Alternative scenario:

- p3 plays against p1: draw once: p3 =1, p1=1

- p3 plays against p2: draw once: p3=2, p2=1

Total points: p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which matches the required scores.

In this case, there are two draws, which matches the output of 2.

Another test case: 1 1 10

Sum is 12, which is even.

p3 =10 >= p1 + p2 =2, so output is p1 + p2 =2.

Is this possible?

Scenario:

- p3 plays against p1: draw once: p3=1, p1=1

- p3 plays against p2: draw once: p3=2, p2=1

- p3 plays against p1: p3 wins once: p3=4, p1=1

- p3 plays against p2: p3 wins once: p3=6, p2=1

- p3 plays against p1: p3 wins once: p3=8, p1=1

- p3 plays against p2: p3 wins once: p3=10, p2=1

Total points: p1=1, p2=1, p3=10, with two draws.

This matches the output of 2.

So, in this case, the maximum number of draws is 2, which is p1 + p2.

Hence, when p3 >= p1 + p2, the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2.

Otherwise, we need another approach.

In the code, when p3 >= p1 + p2, it prints p1 + p2.

Else, it calculates low and high based on p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and iterates to find the maximum number of draws.

I need to verify this part.

Let me consider the test case where p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Sum is 12, which is even.

p3=5 < p1 + p2=7, so it goes to the else clause.

low = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) = min(5-3,5-4) = min(2,1)=1

high = max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) = max(2,1)=2

cur starts at low=1

Check if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)

3 -1 <=4 - (5 -1) => 2 <=4 -4=0 => 2 <=0, which is false.

So, cur +=1 => cur=2

Check again:

3-2 <=4 - (5-2) =>1 <=4 -3=1 =>1 <=1, which is true.

So, print p1 - cur + p3 =3-2 +5=6, which matches the output.

Another test case: p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which is p3 >=p1+p2, so prints p1+p2=2.

Wait, but in this case, p3=2 >= p1+p2=2, so it prints p1+p2=2.

Which matches the output.

Another test case: p1=3, p2=3, p3=3.

Sum is 9, which is odd, so prints -1.

Which matches the output.

Test case: p1=0, p2=0, p3=0.

Sum is 0, which is even, p3=0 >= p1+p2=0, so prints p1+p2=0.

Which matches the output.

Test case: p1=0, p2=1, p3=1.

Sum is 2, which is even, p3=1 >= p1+p2=1, so prints p1+p2=1.

Wait, but the output is 1, which matches.

Wait, but according to the code, if p3 >= p1 + p2, it prints p1 + p2.

But in this case, p1 + p2 =1, and p3=1, which is equal, so prints 1.

But in the earlier reasoning, in this case, there is one draw between p2 and p3, which matches the output of 1.

So, this seems correct.

Hence, the code seems to be implementing the correct logic.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correctness: True}}\]
