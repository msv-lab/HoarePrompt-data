Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to draw a square grid of size n by n, and he wants to color some cells in such a way that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The goal is to minimize the number of cells colored.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two types of diagonals: the main diagonals that go from top-left to bottom-right and the anti-diagonals that go from top-right to bottom-left.

For a grid of size n, the number of main diagonals is n, and the number of anti-diagonals is also n, but actually, it's 2n - 1 diagonals in total of both types combined. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Actually, in a square grid of size n, the number of diagonals going from top-left to bottom-right is 2n - 1, and similarly, the number of diagonals going from top-right to bottom-left is also 2n - 1. So, the total number of diagonals is 4n - 4. But wait, no, that can't be right because some diagonals are shared or something.

Wait, let's think differently. For an n x n grid, the number of diagonals in one direction is 2n - 1, and in the other direction, it's also 2n - 1, but some cells are shared between these diagonals. So, the total number of unique diagonals is 4n - 4, but I'm not sure.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says "the square grid of size n x n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals." So, it's 4n - 2 diagonals in total. That must include both main and anti-diagonals.

Okay, so we have 4n - 2 diagonals in total. Now, Sasha wants at least k of these diagonals to have at least one colored cell. We need to find the minimum number of cells he needs to color to satisfy this condition.

Let's consider some small values of n to get an idea.

Take n = 2. So, grid is 2x2 with 4 cells.

Number of diagonals: 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

But wait, in a 2x2 grid, how many diagonals are there?

Actually, in a 2x2 grid:

- Main diagonals: from (1,1) to (2,2) and from (1,2) to (2,1). So, 2 main diagonals.

- Similarly, anti-diagonals: from (1,2) to (2,1) and from (1,1) to (2,2). Wait, these seem to overlap with the main diagonals.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here.

Actually, in standard terminology:

- The main diagonals are those that run from the top-left to bottom-right.

- The anti-diagonals run from the top-right to bottom-left.

But in a 2x2 grid:

- There are 3 diagonals in total: two main ones and one anti-diagonal, but according to the problem, it's 4*2 - 2 = 6, which seems off.

Wait, maybe the problem counts both main and anti-diagonals separately, even if they overlap in some cells.

I need to clarify this.

Looking back at the sample input, when n=3 and k=4, the output is 2. Similarly, for n=3 and k=10, it's 6.

Wait, for n=3, total diagonals are 4*3 - 2 = 10, which matches the sample input.

So, for n=3, there are 10 diagonals in total.

Now, in a 3x3 grid:

- Main diagonals: from (1,1) to (3,3), and others like (1,2) to (2,3), etc.

- Anti-diagonals: from (1,3) to (3,1), and others.

So, there are multiple diagonals in both directions.

The problem is to select the minimal number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

This sounds like a set cover problem, where each cell covers some diagonals, and we need to select the minimal number of cells to cover at least k diagonals.

However, set cover is NP-hard, but given the constraints (n can be up to 1e8), it's impossible to solve it directly.

Therefore, there must be a smarter way to compute this.

Let's think about how many diagonals a single cell can cover.

Each cell lies on exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal, so two diagonals in total.

Wait, but in some cases, cells on the main diagonal lie on only one main diagonal.

Wait, no, each cell lies on exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

For example, in a 3x3 grid:

- Cell (1,1) is on main diagonal (1,1)-(3,3) and anti-diagonal (1,1)-(1,3).

Wait, no, anti-diagonals are from top-right to bottom-left.

Wait, in standard terms:

- Main diagonals: from top-left to bottom-right.

- Anti-diagonals: from top-right to bottom-left.

So, cell (i,j) lies on main diagonal where i-j is constant, and anti-diagonal where i+j is constant.

Hence, each cell lies on exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Therefore, each cell can cover two diagonals, except when the diagonals overlap, i.e., for the center cell in odd-sized grids.

But in general, each cell covers two diagonals.

Given that, to cover k diagonals with minimal cells, we can try to maximize the number of diagonals covered per cell.

If each cell covers two diagonals, then intuitively, we might think that the minimal number of cells needed is ceil(k/2).

But in the sample input, for n=3 and k=4, the output is 2, which matches ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3 and k=10, output is 6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but the sample output is 6, which doesn't match.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, for n=3, total diagonals are 10.

If k=10, meaning we need to cover all 10 diagonals.

If each cell can cover 2 diagonals, then ideally, we would need ceil(10/2)=5 cells.

But the sample output is 6.

So, my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there is overlap; some diagonals are covered by the same cells.

Maybe not all diagonals are independent in terms of the cells that cover them.

I need to think differently.

Let's consider that there are two sets of diagonals: main diagonals and anti-diagonals.

For n=3:

- Main diagonals: there are 3 main diagonals.

- Anti-diagonals: there are 3 anti-diagonals.

Wait, no. For n=3, the number of main diagonals is 5: 3 from top-left to bottom-right at different offsets, and 2 from top-right to bottom-left.

Wait, perhaps I need to recall the formula for the number of diagonals in a grid.

In a grid of size n x n:

- The number of diagonals from top-left to bottom-right is 2n - 1.

- The number of diagonals from top-right to bottom-left is also 2n - 1.

- So, total diagonals are 4n - 2.

Hence, for n=3, total diagonals are 4*3 - 2 = 10, which matches the sample.

Now, to minimize the number of cells needed to cover at least k diagonals, we need to select cells that cover as many diagonals as possible.

Each cell covers exactly two diagonals: one main and one anti-diagonal.

However, some diagonals may be covered by multiple cells.

So, to minimize the number of cells, we should select cells that cover unique diagonals as much as possible.

This sounds complicated, but perhaps there is a pattern or formula to compute this directly.

Looking at the sample inputs:

- For n=3 and k=4, output is 2.

- For n=3 and k=10, output is 6.

- For n=4 and k=7, output is 4.

- For n=7 and k=11, output is 6.

- For n=2 and k=3, output is 2.

I need to find a pattern or formula that can generate these outputs based on n and k.

Looking at n=3:

- For k=4, output=2.

- For k=10, output=6.

Similarly, for n=4 and k=7, output=4.

For n=7 and k=11, output=6.

For n=2 and k=3, output=2.

I need to find a general formula that can compute this.

Let me consider that in the worst case, when k is small, we can cover multiple diagonals with fewer cells.

But as k increases, we might need to cover more unique diagonals that don't overlap.

Wait, perhaps there is a threshold where covering additional diagonals requires more cells.

Let me consider that for n x n grid, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and same for anti-diagonals.

But in total, there are 4n - 2 diagonals.

Now, if k is less than or equal to 2n, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2).

But for k greater than 2n, maybe it's different.

Looking back at n=3 and k=4, output=2, which matches ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3 and k=10, output=6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but sample output is 6.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((k + 1)/2).

For k=4, floor((4+1)/2)=2.5, but since we need integers, ceil(k/2)=2.

For k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but sample output is 6.

So, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's min(n, ceil(k/2)).

For n=3 and k=4, ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3 and k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but sample output is 6, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's different.

Wait, maybe for k up to 2n, it's ceil(k/2), and for k > 2n, it's ceil(k/2) + (k - 2n).

Wait, let's think differently.

Looking at n=3 and k=10, output=6.

But 2n for n=3 is 6, so for k=10 > 6, perhaps it's ceil(2n) + ceil((k - 2n)/2).

Wait, for n=3, 2n=6.

k=10, so ceil(6/2) + ceil((10-6)/2)=3 + 2=5, but sample output is 6.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's more than that.

Alternatively, maybe it's the minimal number of cells needed to cover at least k diagonals, considering that some diagonals share cells.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in the grid, some diagonals share cells, and some don't.

If I can find a set of diagonals that are pairwise disjoint, meaning no two diagonals share a cell, then to cover each of these diagonals, I need at least one cell per diagonal.

But in reality, many diagonals share cells, so covering one cell can cover multiple diagonals.

Hence, the minimal number of cells needed is determined by the maximum number of pairwise disjoint diagonals that need to be covered.

But this sounds like finding a matching in a bipartite graph where one part is the cells and the other is the diagonals.

But this seems too complicated for the time constraints, especially since n can be up to 1e8.

Therefore, there must be a mathematical formula or a pattern that can be exploited.

Let me consider that each cell covers exactly two diagonals: one main and one anti-diagonal.

Hence, if I select a cell, I cover two diagonals.

But some diagonals may be covered by multiple cells.

So, to cover k diagonals, I need to select cells such that the union of the diagonals they cover has at least k diagonals.

This is similar to set cover, which is NP-hard, but perhaps there's a pattern here.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- For n=3 and k=4, output=2.

- For n=3 and k=10, output=6.

- For n=4 and k=7, output=4.

- For n=7 and k=11, output=6.

- For n=2 and k=3, output=2.

Let me try to find a formula that fits these samples.

Suppose the formula is:

if k <= 2*n:

min_cells = ceil(k / 2)

else:

min_cells = ceil((k + 1) / 2)

But for n=3 and k=10, ceil(11 / 2)=6, which matches the sample.

For n=4 and k=7, ceil(8 / 2)=4, which matches the sample.

For n=7 and k=11, ceil(12 / 2)=6, which matches.

For n=2 and k=3, ceil(4 / 2)=2, which matches.

For n=3 and k=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2, which matches.

So, perhaps the formula is:

if k <= 2*n:

min_cells = ceil(k / 2)

else:

min_cells = ceil((k + 1) / 2)

Wait, but in the else case, it's ceil((k + 1)/2).

Wait, for k=10 in n=3, ceil((10 + 1)/2)=6, which matches.

For k=7 in n=4, ceil((7 + 1)/2)=4, matches.

For k=11 in n=7, ceil((11 + 1)/2)=6, matches.

For k=3 in n=2, ceil((3 + 1)/2)=2, matches.

For k=4 in n=3, ceil((4 + 1)/2)=3, but sample output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps it's min(ceil(k / 2), n).

For n=3 and k=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2, which matches.

For n=3 and k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but sample output is 6, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2), but adjusted for the maximum number of cells needed, which is n for some cases.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have to cover k diagonals, and each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals.

Hence, the minimal number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2).

But in the sample where n=3 and k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but the sample output is 6.

So, this suggests that some diagonals cannot be covered simultaneously by the same cell.

Perhaps because some diagonals are parallel and don't intersect.

Wait, diagonals in one direction are parallel and don't intersect with each other, while diagonals in the other direction do intersect.

Wait, in a grid, main diagonals can intersect, but anti-diagonals can also intersect.

Wait, actually, in a grid, diagonals from different directions can intersect at cells.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered without overlapping.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is the ceiling of k divided by 2, but adjusted by the total number of available cells or something.

But in the sample, for n=3 and k=10, output is 6, which is more than ceil(10 / 2)=5.

So, perhaps there is an adjustment factor based on n.

Wait, maybe it's ceil(k / 2) + max(0, k - 2*n).

For n=3 and k=10, 2*n=6, so ceil(10 / 2)=5 + (10 - 6)=5 + 4=9, which is more than the sample output of 6.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - 2*n)/something).

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for another approach.

I recall that in bipartite graphs, the set cover problem can sometimes be optimized.

But again, with n up to 1e8, I need something efficient.

Perhaps I need to find a way to select cells such that they cover the required diagonals in the most efficient way.

Wait, maybe considering that the grid can be divided into layers or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is equal to the ceiling of k divided by 2, but with a lower bound of some value based on n.

Wait, in the sample where n=3 and k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but output is 6.

Wait, maybe it's the maximum of ceil(k / 2) and some other function of n.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least k diagonals, considering that some diagonals are independent and must be covered by separate cells.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider that for k up to 2n, ceil(k / 2) is sufficient, but for k greater than 2n, it's different.

Wait, for n=3, 2n=6.

For k=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches sample.

For k=10, which is greater than 2n=6, perhaps it's different.

Wait, maybe for k > 2n, it's ceil(k / 2) + (k - 2n).

For k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 + (10 - 6)=5 + 4=9, which doesn't match sample output of 6.

No, that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps for k > 2n, it's ceil(k / 2) + floor((k - 2n)/2).

For k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 + floor((10 - 6)/2)=5 + 2=7, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) + ceil((k - 2n)/2).

For k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5 + ceil((10 - 6)/2)=5 + 2=7, still not matching.

Hmm.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that in the grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is n.

Because, for example, coloring the main diagonal would cover n main diagonals and n anti-diagonals.

Wait, no, coloring the main diagonal would cover one main diagonal and multiple anti-diagonals.

This is getting too tangled.

Perhaps I should look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that each cell covers exactly two diagonals: one main and one anti-diagonal.

Hence, selecting a cell allows us to cover two diagonals.

Therefore, to cover k diagonals, we need at least ceil(k / 2) cells.

But in the sample where n=3 and k=10, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but the sample output is 6.

So, perhaps there is an additional constraint based on n.

Looking at n=3, total diagonals are 10.

To cover all 10 diagonals, we need 6 cells, which is more than ceil(10 / 2)=5.

Perhaps, for k > 2n - 1, the minimal number of cells needed is ceil((k + 1) / 2).

For k=10, ceil(11 / 2)=6, which matches the sample.

For k=7 in n=4, ceil(8 / 2)=4, matches sample.

For k=11 in n=7, ceil(12 / 2)=6, matches sample.

For k=3 in n=2, ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches sample.

For k=4 in n=3, ceil(5 / 2)=3, but sample output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, inconsistency again.

Wait, perhaps it's different.

Wait, maybe for k <= 2n - 1, it's ceil(k / 2), and for k >= 2n, it's ceil((k + 1)/2).

For n=3, 2n - 1=5.

For k=4 <=5, ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches sample.

For k=10 >=6, ceil(11 / 2)=6, matches sample.

For n=4, 2n -1=7.

For k=7 >=7, ceil(8 / 2)=4, matches sample.

For n=7, 2n -1=13.

For k=11 <13, but according to the rule, for k >=2n, which is 8, so ceil(12 / 2)=6, matches.

For n=2, 2n -1=3.

For k=3 >=3, ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches.

For n=3 and k=4 <=5, ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the formula seems to be:

if k <= 2n -1:

min_cells = ceil(k / 2)

else:

min_cells = ceil((k + 1) / 2)

Wait, but for n=3 and k=10, which is greater than 2n -1=5, it's ceil(11 / 2)=6, matches.

For n=3 and k=4, which is less than or equal to 2n -1=5, ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches.

For n=4 and k=7, which is equal to 2n -1=7, ceil(8 / 2)=4, matches.

For n=7 and k=11, which is greater than 2n -1=13, but according to the rule, for k >=2n, which is 14, but in this case, k=11 <14, so which rule to apply?

Wait, perhaps it's:

if k <= 2n -1:

min_cells = ceil(k / 2)

else:

min_cells = ceil((k + 1)/2)

But for n=7 and k=11, which is less than 2n=14, but greater than 2n -1=13, wait, no, 11 <13.

Wait, for n=7, 2n=14, 2n -1=13.

So, for k=11 <13, according to the rule, it should be ceil(k / 2)=6, which matches the sample.

Wait, but according to the initial thought, for k <=2n -1, use ceil(k / 2), else ceil((k +1)/2).

But in this case, for k=11 <2n -1=13, it's ceil(11 / 2)=6, matches.

For k=14, it would be ceil((14 +1)/2)=7.5, which is 8, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of k <=2n -1 and k >2n -1.

For k <=2n -1, min_cells = ceil(k / 2)

For k >2n -1, min_cells = ceil((k +1)/2)

But for n=7 and k=11, which is less than 2n -1=13, so min_cells=ceil(11 / 2)=6, matches.

For n=3 and k=10, which is greater than 2n -1=5, min_cells=ceil(11 / 2)=6, matches.

For n=4 and k=7, which is equal to 2n -1=7, min_cells=ceil(8 / 2)=4, matches.

For n=2 and k=3, which is equal to 2n -1=3, min_cells=ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches.

For n=3 and k=4, which is less than 2n -1=5, min_cells=ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches.

Hence, the formula seems to be:

if k <= 2n -1:

min_cells = ceil(k / 2)

else:

min_cells = ceil((k +1)/2)

Wait, but for n=3 and k=10, which is greater than 2n -1=5, ceil(11 / 2)=6, matches.

For n=4 and k=7, ceil(8 / 2)=4, matches.

For n=7 and k=11, ceil(12 / 2)=6, matches.

For n=2 and k=3, ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches.

For n=3 and k=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches.

So, this seems consistent.

Hence, the formula is:

if k <= 2n -1:

min_cells = ceil(k / 2)

else:

min_cells = ceil((k +1)/2)

But in the code provided, it's:

if k ==1:

print(1)

elif k <=2*n:

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 +1)

Wait, for k==1, it prints 1, which makes sense because you need at least one cell colored to cover at least one diagonal.

For k <=2*n, it's ceil(k / 2), which matches our formula for k <=2n -1, but in our formula, it's k <=2n -1.

But in the code, it's k <=2*n.

Wait, for n=3 and k=4, 4 <=6 (2*3), so ceil(4 / 2)=2, matches.

For n=3 and k=10, 10 >6, so k//2 +1=5+1=6, matches.

For n=4 and k=7, 7 <=8 (2*4), ceil(7 / 2)=4, wait, ceil(7 / 2)=3.5, which is 4, matches.

For n=7 and k=11, 11 <=14 (2*7), ceil(11 / 2)=6, matches.

For n=2 and k=3, 3 <=4 (2*2), ceil(3 / 2)=2, matches.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Wait, but according to our earlier thought, for k >2n -1, it should be ceil((k +1)/2), but in the code, it's k//2 +1, which for k=10, is 5+1=6, which is equal to ceil(11 / 2)=6.

For k=7, ceil(8 / 2)=4, which is equal to 7//2 +1=3 +1=4.

For k=11, ceil(12 / 2)=6, which is 11//2 +1=5 +1=6.

For k=3, ceil(4 / 2)=2, which is 3//2 +1=1 +1=2.

So, k//2 +1 is equivalent to ceil((k +1)/2).

Hence, the code is implementing the correct formula.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}
