Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. The operation I can perform is to choose any k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each with any number I choose. I need to find the minimum number of cards I can have in the end after performing this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any number. The goal is to minimize the number of cards I have in the end.

Let me think about what this operation allows me to do. Essentially, for every group of k identical cards, I can reduce the count by one, since I'm replacing k cards with k-1 cards. This seems like a way to compress the number of cards by removing one card for every k cards of the same number.

But I can perform this operation any number of times, and I can choose which groups to operate on each time. I need to find a strategy that minimizes the total number of cards.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

Input:

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

So, n=5, k=3, and the cards are [4,1,1,4,4].

From the example, they show a sequence of operations that results in 2 cards. I need to see if this is indeed the minimum.

Looking at the cards, I have three 4's and two 1's.

If I perform the operation on the three 4's, I can replace them with two cards of any number, say two 4's again. Then I have two 4's and two 1's. Now, I can't perform the operation again because I need three identical cards to perform the operation. So, I'm left with four cards, which is more than the example's result of 2. Hmm, seems like there's a better strategy.

Wait, in the operation, I can choose to replace the three 4's with two cards of any number, not necessarily the same number as the original cards. So, I could replace them with two different numbers, but since I can choose any number, maybe it's better to choose a number that I have multiple of.

But actually, the choice of the number for the new cards doesn't matter because I can always choose a number that I have enough of to perform more operations later if possible.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe I can perform operations in a way that creates new groups that allow further operations.

Let's think step by step.

Starting with [4,1,1,4,4]:

- Perform operation on three 4's: replace them with two cards of any number, say two 4's again. Now, I have [4,4,1,1].

- Now, I have two 4's and two 1's. I can't perform the operation again because I need three identical cards.

So, ending with four cards, which is more than the example's result of 2. That means there must be a better way.

Looking back at the example in the problem, they show a different sequence that results in two cards, but it's not provided here. Maybe I need to find a more optimal sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can perform the operation in a way that overlaps groups or something.

Let's try another approach.

I need to minimize the number of cards. Each operation allows me to reduce the number of cards by one in a group of k identical cards.

So, for each group of cards with the same number, I can perform operations to reduce the count.

Let me think in terms of dividing the count of each number by k and seeing how many operations I can perform.

But it's not straightforward because I can choose which groups to operate on and in what order.

Maybe I should consider the counts of each number and find a way to reduce them as much as possible.

Let me consider the counts of each number.

In the first example:

- 4 appears three times

- 1 appears two times

For the 4's, I can perform one operation: replace three 4's with two cards. Then I have two 4's and two 1's. No more operations can be performed.

Is there a way to perform another operation? Maybe if I choose to replace the two 4's with one card, but k is 3, so I can't perform an operation on only two cards.

So, seems like I'm stuck with four cards.

But the example says the answer is 2, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the three 4's with two cards of a different number, say two 1's.

Then, I would have two 1's and two 1's, totaling four 1's. Now, with four 1's and k=3, I can perform one operation: replace three 1's with two cards. Choose to replace them with two 1's again. Now, I have two 1's and one remaining 1, totaling three 1's. Still more than the example's 2.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace three 1's with two different numbers.

Wait, but I can choose any number for the new cards, so maybe I can choose a number that I have multiple of.

But I think I'm missing a key insight here.

Let me look at another example.

Third example:

7 2

4 2 1 100 5 2 3

So, n=7, k=2, and cards are [4,2,1,100,5,2,3]

In this case, I can perform operations on pairs of identical cards.

Looking at the counts:

- 2 appears twice

- 4,1,100,5,3 each appear once

So, I can perform one operation on the two 2's: replace them with one card of any number, say 2 again.

Now, I have [2,1,100,5,3]

No more operations can be performed because no group has two identical cards.

So, ending with five cards, but the output for this case is 1, which is different from my conclusion. So, clearly, I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I can perform operations in a way that creates new groups.

Wait, with k=2, I can replace any two identical cards with one card of any number.

So, perhaps I can chain operations in a way that reduces the total number further.

Wait, but in the above case, after replacing the two 2's with one 2, I have [2,1,100,5,3]. Now, I have only one 2, so no more operations can be performed.

But according to the output, the answer is 1, meaning it's possible to end up with only one card. So, there must be a better sequence of operations.

Maybe I need to choose the numbers for the new cards carefully to create further possibilities.

Let's try again.

Starting with [4,2,1,100,5,2,3]

- Perform operation on two 2's: replace them with one card, say choose to make it a 1.

Now, I have [4,1,100,5,1,3]

- Now, I have two 1's. Perform operation on these two 1's: replace them with one card, say choose to make it a 4.

Now, I have [4,100,5,4,3]

- Now, I have two 4's. Perform operation on these two 4's: replace them with one card, say choose to make it a 100.

Now, I have [100,5,100,3]

- Now, I have two 100's. Perform operation on these two 100's: replace them with one card, say choose to make it a 5.

Now, I have [5,3,5]

- Now, I have two 5's. Perform operation on these two 5's: replace them with one card, say choose to make it a 3.

Now, I have [3,3]

- Now, I have two 3's. Perform operation on these two 3's: replace them with one card, say choose to make it a 1.

Now, I have [1]

So, ending with one card. That matches the output.

Wow, so by carefully choosing the numbers for the new cards, I can create new groups that allow further operations.

So, the key is not only to reduce the counts but also to strategically choose the numbers for the new cards to create more groups for further operations.

That makes sense now.

So, in the first example, perhaps a similar strategy can be applied.

First example again:

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

Let's try to apply a similar strategy.

Starting with [4,1,1,4,4]

- Perform operation on three 4's: replace them with two cards, say choose to make them 1's.

Now, I have [1,1,1]

- Now, perform operation on three 1's: replace them with two cards, say choose to make them 1's again.

Now, I have [1,1]

- Can't perform any more operations.

Wait, but according to the output, the answer is 2, which matches this.

Wait, earlier I thought it was possible to get down to 2, but I was confused because I thought it was higher.

So, in this case, by choosing to make the new cards 1's, I was able to perform another operation on the resulting three 1's, reducing them to two 1's.

So, the minimal number is 2.

Another example:

10 4

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

So, n=10, k=4, and all cards are 1's.

- Perform operation on four 1's: replace them with three 1's.

Now, I have [1,1,1,1,1,1]

- Perform operation on four 1's again: replace them with three 1's.

Now, I have [1,1,1]

- Can't perform any more operations.

So, ending with three cards, which matches the output.

Alright, so the strategy seems to be to repeatedly perform operations on groups of k identical cards, reducing their count by one each time, and choosing the number for the new cards in a way that allows further operations if possible.

Now, I need to generalize this to find the minimal number of cards possible.

Looking at the operation: replacing k cards with k-1 cards.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by one.

So, the minimal number of cards is the total number minus the maximum number of operations I can perform.

Hence, I need to maximize the number of operations I can perform.

Each operation requires k identical cards.

So, for each unique number, I can perform floor(count / k) operations on them.

Wait, but it's not that simple because after each operation, I get new cards that can be used in future operations.

In the earlier example, I chose to make the new cards the same as existing ones to create new groups for further operations.

So, it's beneficial to choose the number for the new cards such that it allows more operations in the future.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to always choose the number for the new cards to be the one that has the highest remaining count after the operation, so that I can perform as many operations as possible in the future.

Wait, but it's a bit more involved than that.

Actually, since I can choose any number for the new cards, I can choose a number that is currently the most abundant to potentially create larger groups for future operations.

But this seems complicated to implement.

Is there a simpler way to approach this?

Let me think in terms of graph theory or some other mathematical model, but that might be overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a greedy algorithm where, at each step, I choose the largest group and perform operations on it.

But I need to find a way to compute the minimal number of cards without simulating the entire process step by step.

Is there a formula or a mathematical expression that can give me the minimal number directly?

Let me consider that each operation reduces the total number of cards by one, as I replace k cards with k-1 cards.

So, if I can perform m operations, the total reduction is m, and the minimal number of cards is n - m.

Now, the question is, what is the maximum number of operations m I can perform?

Well, m is limited by the number of groups of size at least k.

But since I can choose which groups to operate on, and the operations can create new groups, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum number of operations I can perform is determined by the counts of each unique number.

Let me consider that for each unique number, I can perform floor(count / k) operations on it, each reducing the count by one.

But actually, it's more nuanced because after performing an operation on a group, the new cards I add can be used in future operations.

So, it's like a cascading reduction.

This seems complex to handle directly.

Is there a better way to model this?

Wait a minute, perhaps I can think in terms of base-k representation or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can think recursively.

Let me consider that after performing an operation on a group of k identical cards, I replace them with k-1 cards.

Now, these k-1 cards can be used in future operations if I have enough of them.

But it's still tricky.

Wait, maybe I can model this using the concept of carrying over in division.

Let me consider each unique number separately.

For each unique number, I can group its cards into sets of k, and for each set, I replace them with k-1 cards.

But since I can choose the number for the new cards, I can assign them to any number I want, potentially creating new groups.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think about the total number of cards and how operations reduce them.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by one, as I replace k cards with k-1 cards.

So, the maximal number of operations I can perform is limited by the initial number of cards.

But I also need to consider that I can only perform operations on groups of k identical cards.

Hence, the number of operations I can perform is limited by the number of such groups I can form.

Wait, perhaps I can compute, for each unique number, how many times I can perform operations on its cards.

But again, the operations can be chained in a way that allows for more operations.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]

if max(p) >= k:

print(k - 1)

else:

print(n)

So, for each test case, it reads n, k, and the list of card numbers.

Then, it computes the count of each unique number in the list and stores these counts in p.

Then, if the maximum count in p is greater than or equal to k, it prints k-1, else it prints n.

Wait, that seems too simplistic.

In the first example:

n=5, k=3, counts are [3,2] (three 4's and two 1's). max(p)=3 >=3, so it prints k-1=2, which matches the example.

In the second example:

n=1, k=10, counts=[1]. max(p)=1 <10, so it prints n=1, which matches the output.

In the third example:

n=7, k=2, counts=[2,1,1,1,1,1]. max(p)=2 >=2, so it prints k-1=1, which matches the output.

In the fourth example:

n=10, k=4, counts=[10]. max(p)=10 >=4, so it prints k-1=3, which matches the output.

In the fifth example:

n=5, k=2, counts=[1,1,1,1,1]. max(p)=1 <2, so it prints n=5, which matches the output.

In the sixth example:

n=6, k=2, counts=[2,2,1,1]. max(p)=2 >=2, so it prints k-1=1, which matches the output.

In the seventh example:

n=6, k=3, counts=[2,2,2]. max(p)=2 <3, so it prints n=6, which matches the output.

So, in all the provided examples, this program gives the correct answer.

Is this just a coincidence, or is there a deeper reason why this works?

Wait, perhaps there is a pattern here that I'm missing.

Let me think about what this program is doing.

It's checking if any number appears at least k times. If yes, it prints k-1, else it prints n.

In the first example, since 4 appears three times and k=3, it prints 2.

In the third example, 2 appears twice and k=2, so it prints 1.

In the fourth example, 1 appears ten times and k=4, so it prints 3.

In the sixth example, there are two 10's and two 20's, so counts are [2,2,1,1], and k=2, so it prints 1.

In the seventh example, counts are [2,2,2], max count is 2 <3, so it prints 6.

So, it seems to be working correctly for these cases.

But is this always true?

Let me try to think of a case where this logic fails.

Suppose n=4, k=2, and counts are [2,2]. So, max(p)=2 >=2, so the program would print 1.

Is this correct?

Let's see:

Starting with [1,1,2,2]

- Perform operation on two 1's: replace them with one card, say 1.

Now, have [1,2,2]

- Can't perform any more operations.

So, ending with three cards, but according to the program, it would print 1, which is not matching.

Wait, but according to the program's logic, it would print k-1=1, but in reality, I can only get down to three cards.

So, this seems like a case where the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the examples provided, the program gives correct outputs, but in this hypothetical case, it seems to give an incorrect output.

Hence, perhaps the program is incorrect in general, even though it works for the provided examples.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in my reasoning.

Let me think again.

In the hypothetical case:

n=4, k=2, counts=[2,2]

According to the program, since max(p)=2 >=k=2, it prints k-1=1.

But in reality, as I simulated, I can only get down to three cards.

So, the program is giving an incorrect answer in this case.

Hence, the program is not always correct.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
