Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n by n matrix, initially all zeros, and I can perform two types of operations. Each operation allows me to set a whole row or a whole column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix, and I need to do this with no more than 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. Type 1 operation lets me choose a row and set each element in that row to a permutation of 1 to n. So, for example, if n is 3, I can set row 1 to be [2, 3, 1], row 2 to [1, 2, 3], etc. Similarly, Type 2 operation allows me to choose a column and set each element in that column to a permutation of 1 to n.

The key here is that I can choose any permutation for each operation, which means I can arrange the numbers in any order within the row or column I'm operating on. The challenge is to arrange these numbers in such a way that the sum of the entire matrix is maximized.

Now, I need to think about how these operations interact with each other. If I perform a Type 1 operation on a row, it sets all the elements in that row. Similarly, a Type 2 operation on a column sets all the elements in that column. If I perform both operations on the same row and column, there might be overlaps where a single element is being set multiple times.

Let's consider a small example to get a better understanding. Let's take n=2.

Initially, the matrix is:

0 0

0 0

If I perform a Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation [2,1], the matrix becomes:

2 1

0 0

Then, if I perform a Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation [2,1], it becomes:

2 1

2 1

Now, if I perform a Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation [2,1], it becomes:

2 1

2 1

Wait, but according to the Type 2 operation, it should set a_{j,1} = p_j, so for column 1, with p=[2,1], it should set a_{1,1}=2 and a_{2,1}=1. So the matrix should be:

2 1

1 1

Hmm, that's different from what I thought initially. So, Type 2 operation on column 1 with [2,1] sets the first column to 2 on top and 1 below.

Similarly, if I do another Type 2 operation on column 2 with [2,1], it should set a_{1,2}=2 and a_{2,2}=1, so the matrix becomes:

2 2

1 1

Now, the sum is 2+2+1+1=6.

But according to the example in the problem for n=2, they achieved a sum of 7 with 3 operations. So, I must be missing something.

Let me look back at the example provided in the problem.

In the second test case, n=2, and they achieved a sum of 7 with 3 operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with permutation [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with permutation [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with permutation [1,2]

Let's simulate that.

Start with:

0 0

0 0

After Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]:

1 2

0 0

Then, Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]:

1 2

1 2

Then, Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]:

1 2

2 2

Sum is 1+2+2+2=7.

Okay, so by performing both row and column operations, they managed to set some elements twice, allowing higher values to be placed in certain positions.

So, it seems that by performing both row and column operations, I can set some elements to higher values by overwriting them.

Now, I need to find a general strategy to maximize the sum for any n.

First, let's think about the maximum possible sum if I could set every element to n. That would be n^3, but I need to achieve this with no more than 2n operations.

However, since each operation sets an entire row or column, I need to find a way to cover the matrix effectively with these operations.

One idea is to perform Type 1 operations on all rows, setting each row to the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]. Then, perform Type 2 operations on all columns, also setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Wait, but in the example above, when I did that for n=2, I got:

First, set row 1 to [2,1], then row 2 to [2,1], resulting in:

2 1

2 1

Then, set column 1 to [2,1], and column 2 to [2,1], resulting in:

2 2

1 1

Sum is 2+2+1+1=6, which is less than the 7 achieved in the example.

Wait, but in the example, they only did 3 operations: two Type 1 and one Type 2.

So, maybe doing all Type 1 and all Type 2 is not optimal.

I need to think differently.

Another approach is to prioritize setting the highest values in positions that will be overwritten less.

Wait, that might not make sense.

Let me think in terms of the number of operations affecting a particular element.

Each element is at the intersection of one row and one column. So, if I perform a Type 1 operation on its row and a Type 2 operation on its column, the final value of the element will be the one set by the last operation affecting it.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to arrange the operations such that the highest possible values are set in the positions where they won't be overwritten by later operations with lower values.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should aim to set the higher values in positions that are affected by only one operation, and lower values in positions affected by two operations.

But that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, no. If an element is affected by both a row operation and a column operation, the last operation performed will set its value.

So, to maximize the sum, I should try to set the highest possible values in as many elements as possible, especially in positions where I can ensure they are not overwritten with lower values.

One possible strategy is to first perform all Type 1 operations to set all rows to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then perform Type 2 operations on specific columns to overwrite certain elements with higher values.

But I need to be careful about the order of operations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to perform all Type 1 operations first, and then perform Type 2 operations to overwrite certain columns with higher values.

Let me try this for n=2.

Perform Type 1 on row 1 with [2,1]:

2 1

0 0

Then, Type 1 on row 2 with [2,1]:

2 1

2 1

Now, perform Type 2 on column 1 with [2,1]:

2 1

1 1

Sum is 2+1+1+1=5, which is less than the example's 7.

Wait, in the example, they set row 1 to [1,2], row 2 to [1,2], and then column 1 to [1,2], resulting in:

1 2

2 2

Sum 7.

So, using [1,2] instead of [2,1].

Is there a reason for that?

Wait, perhaps the order of the permutation matters.

In the first case, setting row 1 to [2,1], row 2 to [2,1], and column 1 to [2,1], results in:

2 2

1 1

Sum 6.

Wait, different from before.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Let me redo this.

Start with:

0 0

0 0

Type 1 on row 1 with [2,1]:

2 1

0 0

Type 1 on row 2 with [2,1]:

2 1

2 1

Type 2 on column 1 with [2,1]:

2 1

1 1

Wait, but according to the example, if I set row 1 to [1,2], row 2 to [1,2], and column 1 to [1,2], I get:

1 2

2 2

Sum 7.

So, perhaps the order of the permutation matters.

If I set row 1 to [1,2], row 2 to [1,2], and then column 1 to [1,2], I get:

1 2

1 2

Then, setting column 1 to [1,2]:

1 2

2 2

Sum 7.

Okay, so by choosing the permutation [1,2] instead of [2,1], I can achieve a higher sum.

So, perhaps choosing the permutation in a certain order can lead to higher sums.

Wait, but in the first approach, when I chose [n, n-1, ..., 1], I got a lower sum compared to choosing [1,2].

This is confusing.

Wait, for n=2, [1,2] is equivalent to [2,1] in terms of the values, but the order matters because of the operations.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps, I should aim to set higher values in positions that will be overwritten by column operations.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the example, by setting row 1 to [1,2], row 2 to [1,2], and then column 1 to [1,2], the matrix becomes:

1 2

1 2

Then, applying column 1 with [1,2]:

1 2

2 2

So, the first element (1,1) was set to 1 by row 1 operation, then overwritten to 1 by column 1 operation.

The second element (1,2) was set to 2 by row 1 operation and not overwritten.

Third element (2,1) was set to 1 by row 2 operation, then overwritten to 2 by column 1 operation.

Fourth element (2,2) was set to 2 by row 2 operation and not overwritten.

So, the sum is 1+2+2+2=7.

If, instead, I set row 1 to [2,1], row 2 to [2,1], and column 1 to [2,1], the matrix would be:

2 1

2 1

Then, applying column 1 with [2,1]:

2 1

1 1

Sum 2+1+1+1=5, which is less than 7.

So, choosing [1,2] instead of [2,1] in the permutations leads to a higher sum.

Why is that?

Wait, perhaps because when I set rows with [1,2], and then overwrite column 1 with [1,2], the overwrites are setting some elements to higher values.

Wait, in this case, the overwrites are setting a_{2,1} from 1 to 2.

So, by choosing [1,2], I'm setting lower values initially, but then overwriting them to higher values in columns.

Wait, but in this specific case, it worked because I could overwrite a lower value in row 2, column 1, to a higher value.

But I need a general strategy.

Let me think about it differently.

Each element in the matrix can be set by either a row operation or a column operation, with the last operation determining its value.

So, for each element, I can choose whether to set it via a row operation or a column operation.

But since I have to perform operations on entire rows or columns, I need to find a way to maximize the sum across the whole matrix.

One way to approach this is to consider that each operation on a row or column allows me to set its elements to a permutation of 1 to n.

I need to maximize the sum, so I should aim to set as many high-value elements as possible.

But with permutations, I can't just set all elements to n; I have to arrange them in a way that respects the permutations.

Another idea: since I can perform up to 2n operations, I can do n row operations and n column operations.

If I do n row operations, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then n column operations, setting each column to [n, n-1, ..., 1], the final matrix will be determined by the last operations performed on each element.

Specifically, for element a_{i,j}, if the last operation affecting it is a row operation on row i, its value will be the j-th element of the permutation for row i. If the last operation affecting it is a column operation on column j, its value will be the i-th element of the permutation for column j.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to arrange the operations such that each element is set by the operation that can assign it the highest possible value.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider the maximum possible sum achievable.

If I could set each element to n, the sum would be n^3. But that's not possible with permutations.

Given that each row and each column can only contain each number from 1 to n once, the actual maximum sum is constrained by the fact that in any row or column, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

Wait, but since I can choose different permutations for each row and each column, perhaps I can arrange it so that the highest numbers are placed in positions where they won't conflict with each other.

Wait, but the operations overwrite each other, so it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I should look at it differently.

Suppose I perform all Type 1 operations first, setting each row to a certain permutation, and then perform all Type 2 operations, setting each column to a certain permutation.

In this case, the elements will be set by the last operation that affects them.

So, for example, if I do all Type 1 operations first, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then all Type 2 operations, setting each column to [n, n-1, ..., 1], then each element a_{i,j} will be set to p_j (from the column operation), since the column operation is the last one.

So, the matrix would be:

p11 p12 ... p1n

p21 p22 ... p2n

...

pn1 pn2 ... pnn

where pij is the value set by the column operation on column j, specifically pij = p_j for column j's permutation.

But since each column operation sets a_{j,i} = p_j, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in Type 2 operation, choosing column i and permutation p1, p2, ..., pn means setting a_{j,i} = p_j for all j.

So, for column i, the first row gets p1, second row gets p2, and so on.

So, if I perform all Type 2 operations, setting each column i to permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], then the matrix would be:

n (col1)  n (col2)  ...  n (col n)

n-1        n-1             n-1

...        ...     ...     ...

1          1       ...     1

So, each column is [n, n-1, ..., 1], meaning the matrix is:

n   n   ...  n

n-1 n-1 ... n-1

... ... ... ...

1   1   ... 1

The sum would be n*(1 + 2 + ... + n) = n*(n(n+1)/2) = n^2(n+1)/2.

Similarly, if I perform all Type 1 operations, setting each row i to [n, n-1, ..., 1], the matrix would be:

n   n-1  ...  1

n   n-1  ...  1

... ...  ... ...

n   n-1  ...  1

Sum would be n*(n + (n-1) + ... + 1) = n*(n(n+1)/2) = n^2(n+1)/2.

So, in both cases, the sum is the same.

But in the example, by performing a combination of Type 1 and Type 2 operations, they achieved a higher sum.

So, there must be a better way to combine these operations.

Let me think about mixing Type 1 and Type 2 operations.

Suppose I perform Type 1 operations on some rows and Type 2 operations on some columns.

Each element a_{i,j} will be set by the last operation that affects it.

So, if I perform Type 1 on row i with permutation p, then a_{i,j} = p_j.

If later I perform Type 2 on column j with permutation q, then a_{i,j} = q_i.

So, by choosing which operations to perform last on each element, I can control the values.

To maximize the sum, I need to maximize the value of each a_{i,j}.

Given that, perhaps I should aim to set as many a_{i,j} to n as possible, then to n-1, and so on.

But since each row and each column can only contain one of each number from 1 to n, I need to distribute the numbers appropriately.

Wait, but in this problem, since operations can overwrite each other, it's not directly constrained by the usual permutation matrix constraints.

Wait, actually, it is, because each row and each column must contain a permutation.

But in this problem, it's different because operations are setting entire rows or columns to permutations, and operations can overwrite each other.

Wait, no, actually, in this problem, operations don't constrain each other in terms of the values they set; it's just that the last operation on each element determines its value.

So, perhaps I can think of it as: I can perform operations in any order, and the last operation on each element determines its value.

So, to maximize the sum, I should aim to set as many elements as possible to n, then to n-1, and so on, within the constraints of the permutations.

But it's tricky because each operation sets a whole row or column to a permutation of 1 to n.

An alternative approach is to consider that each operation can set a row or column independently, and the final matrix is the result of overlapping these operations, with the last operation taking precedence.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of covering the matrix with row and column operations, where each operation sets its respective row or column to a permutation, and the intersections determine the final values.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a pattern or formula that can give me the maximum sum.

Looking back at the example for n=2, the maximum sum is 7.

For n=1, it's 1.

For n=2, it's 7.

Let me try to find a general formula for the sum.

For n=1: sum=1

For n=2: sum=7

For n=3: let's see.

If I follow the pattern from n=2, perhaps sum = n^3 - something.

Wait, n=1: 1 = 1

n=2: 7 = 8 -1

n=3: ?

If n=3, what would be the maximum sum?

Let's try to compute it.

If I perform Type 1 operations on all rows with [3,2,1], and Type 2 operations on all columns with [3,2,1], the matrix would be:

3 2 1

2 2 2

1 2 3

Wait, no.

Wait, if I do Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1], row 2 with [3,2,1], row 3 with [3,2,1], and then Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1], column 2 with [3,2,1], column 3 with [3,2,1], the final matrix would be:

3 2 1

2 2 2

1 2 3

Sum is 3+2+1 + 2+2+2 + 1+2+3 = 18.

But is this the maximum?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better arrangement.

If I do Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1], row 2 with [3,2,1], row 3 with [3,2,1], and then Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1], the matrix becomes:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum is 3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1 = 15.

If I do Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1], row 2 with [3,2,1], row 3 with [3,2,1], and Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1], column 2 with [3,2,1], and column 3 with [3,2,1], as before, sum is 18.

But perhaps I can do better.

Wait, maybe I need to choose different permutations.

For example, set rows with [1,2,3], and columns with [1,2,3].

Then, the matrix would be:

1 2 3

1 2 3

1 2 3

Sum is 1+2+3 +1+2+3 +1+2+3 = 18.

Same as before.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

Wait, but in the previous approach, I got sum=18.

Is there a way to get higher than that?

Let me see.

If I perform Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1], row 2 with [3,2,1], row 3 with [3,2,1], and then Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1], column 2 with [3,2,1], column 3 with [3,2,1], the matrix is:

3 2 1

2 2 2

1 2 3

Sum is 3+2+1 + 2+2+2 + 1+2+3 = 18.

Alternatively, if I perform Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1], row 2 with [3,2,1], row 3 with [3,2,1], and then Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1], column 2 with [3,2,1], column 3 with [3,2,1], same as above.

Wait, maybe I need to choose different permutations.

Suppose I set rows with [3,2,1], and columns with [1,2,3].

Then, the matrix would be:

1 2 3

2 2 3

3 2 3

Sum is 1+2+3 +2+2+3 +3+2+3 = 21.

Wait, that's higher than 18.

How did that happen?

Let me verify.

Perform Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1], row 2 with [3,2,1], row 3 with [3,2,1], setting the matrix to:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Then, perform Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2,3], column 2 with [1,2,3], column 3 with [1,2,3].

After column operations:

Column 1 set to [1,2,3], so a_{1,1}=1, a_{2,1}=2, a_{3,1}=3

Column 2 set to [1,2,3], so a_{1,2}=1, a_{2,2}=2, a_{3,2}=3

Column 3 set to [1,2,3], so a_{1,3}=1, a_{2,3}=2, a_{3,3}=3

So, the matrix becomes:

1 1 1

2 2 2

3 3 3

Sum is 1+1+1 +2+2+2 +3+3+3 = 18.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, no, in this case, it's 18.

But earlier, I thought of 21, but that was a mistake.

So, sum is 18.

Is there a way to get higher than 18?

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I perform Type 1 operations on the first n rows with [n, n-1, ..., 1], and Type 2 operations on the first n columns with [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Then, the matrix would be:

n n-1 ... 1

n n-1 ... 1

... ... ... ...

n n-1 ... 1

Then, perform Type 2 operations on columns to set them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

So, the final matrix would be:

n n-1 ... 1

n-1 n-2 ... 1

... ... ... ...

1 1 ... 1

Sum would be n*n + (n-1)*(n-1) + ... + 1*1 = sum from k=1 to n of k^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

For n=3, that would be 3*4*7/6 = 14.

But 14 is less than 18, so not better.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider the formula for the sum.

Each operation sets a row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, and the last operation on each element determines its value.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the number of high-value elements in the matrix.

Given that, perhaps I should aim to have as many n's as possible, then n-1's, and so on.

But since each row and column must be a permutation, there are constraints.

Wait, but in this problem, operations are independent except for the overwriting effect.

An alternative idea: perhaps the maximum sum is achieved when the matrix is filled with as many n's as possible, then n-1's, and so on, respecting the operation constraints.

But it's still not clear.

Let me look for a pattern in the sums for small n.

For n=1: sum=1

For n=2: sum=7

For n=3: sum=18

Is there a formula that fits these sums?

Let's see:

n=1: 1 = 1^3

n=2: 7 = 2^3 -1

n=3: 18 = 3^3 -9

Hmm, not obvious.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the first n squares: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

For n=1: 1

For n=2: 1+4=5

For n=3: 1+4+9=14

But in our case, for n=2, sum=7, which is less than 5, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe it's n*n*(n+1)/2.

For n=1: 1*1*2/2=1

For n=2: 2*2*3/2=6

For n=3: 3*3*4/2=18

For n=2, 6 is less than 7, but in the example, sum=7.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, n=1:1, n=2:7, n=3:18.

Let me see:

n=1: 1

n=2: 7

n=3:18

Looking for a formula that fits these.

Let me try n(n(n+1)/2).

For n=1:1*(1*2/2)=1

n=2:2*(2*3/2)=6

n=3:3*(3*4/2)=18

So, for n=2, it's 6, but in the example, sum=7, which is higher than 6.

Wait, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, maybe it's n*n*(n+1)/2 - some adjustment.

Wait, for n=2: 8 -1=7

For n=3:27 -9=18

For n=1:1 -0=1

So, n^3 - (n(n-1))/2

For n=2:8 -1=7

n=3:27 -9=18

n=1:1 -0=1

Yes, this seems to fit.

So, sum = n^3 - (n(n-1))/2

Wait, but for n=2:8 -1=7

n=3:27 -9=18

n=1:1 -0=1

This seems consistent.

So, the formula for the sum is n^3 - (n(n-1))/2

Wait, but let's verify for n=2: 8 -1=7, correct.

n=3:27 -9=18, correct.

n=1:1 -0=1, correct.

So, sum = n^3 - floor(n(n-1)/2)

Wait, but for n=2, floor(2*1/2)=1, so 8-1=7.

For n=3, floor(3*2/2)=3, 27-3=24, but earlier we had sum=18 for n=3.

Wait, inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - (n choose 2)*something.

Wait, n choose 2 is n(n-1)/2.

For n=2: 8 -1=7

For n=3:27 - (3*2/2)=27-3=24, but earlier we had sum=18 for n=3.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - (n choose 2)*n.

For n=2:8 - (1)*2=6, not matching 7.

Wait, not consistent.

Alternative idea: perhaps it's n*(n+1)*(4n-1)/6.

For n=1:1*2*3/6=1

n=2:2*3*7/6=7

n=3:3*4*11/6=22

But for n=3, earlier we had sum=18, which doesn't match 22.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe it's n*(n+1)*(2n-1)/6.

For n=1:1*2*1/6=0.333, not integer.

Wait, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's (n*(n+1)/2)*(2n-1)/2.

For n=1:(1*2/2)*(1)/2=0.5, not matching.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternative approach: perhaps think in terms of the sum being the sum of the maximum possible values in the matrix given the operation constraints.

Given that each operation sets a row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, and operations can overwrite each other, perhaps the sum can be expressed in terms of the number of operations and their interactions.

Wait, perhaps consider that each element can be set by at most two operations, and the last operation determines its value.

So, if an element is set by only one operation, its value is determined by that operation.

If it's set by two operations, its value is determined by the last operation performed.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the values set by the operations, considering that some elements might be set by two operations.

Perhaps, the optimal strategy is to perform n row operations and n column operations, arranging the permutations such that the maximum possible values are achieved in the matrix.

But how?

Wait, perhaps look at it from the perspective of the maximum possible sum achievable with the constraints.

Each row and each column must be a permutation of 1 to n, but since operations can overwrite each other, perhaps the constraints are different.

Wait, but in reality, operations set entire rows or columns to permutations, and the last operation on each element determines its value.

So, perhaps the matrix can have duplicates in rows and columns, unlike a standard permutation matrix.
