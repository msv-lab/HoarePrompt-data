Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n by n matrix, initially all zeros, and I can perform two types of operations. Each operation allows me to set a whole row or a whole column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix, and I need to do this with no more than 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. A type 1 operation lets me choose a row and set its elements to any permutation of 1 through n. Similarly, a type 2 operation lets me choose a column and set its elements to any permutation of 1 through n.

Since I can choose any permutation for a row or a column, I can essentially set any value from 1 to n in any position, but with the constraint that in a row or column, each number appears only once because it's a permutation.

Wait, no. Actually, when I set a row or a column, I'm setting all its elements at once to the chosen permutation. So, if I set row i to a permutation p, then a[i][j] = p[j] for all j. Similarly, if I set column j to a permutation p, then a[i][j] = p[i] for all i.

Now, the challenge is that performing operations on rows and columns can overwrite each other because a single element a[i][j] is part of both row i and column j.

I need to find a sequence of operations that maximizes the sum of a[i][j] over all i and j, with at most 2n operations.

Let me think about the maximum possible sum. If I could set every a[i][j] to n, the sum would be n * n * n = n^3. But is that possible with the given operations?

Well, since each row or column operation sets an entire row or column to a permutation of 1 through n, meaning each row or column can have each number from 1 to n exactly once, but not necessarily all n's in a single row or column.

Wait, no. A permutation of 1 through n means each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in the row or column. So, in a single row or column, the sum is always n*(n+1)/2. If I set all rows to permutations, the total sum would be n * [n*(n+1)/2] = n^2*(n+1)/2. Similarly, if I set all columns to permutations, the total sum would also be n^2*(n+1)/2.

But if I perform operations on both rows and columns, there might be overlaps, and the final value of a[i][j] would be set by the last operation that affects it.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to arrange the operations in such a way that the highest possible numbers are set in as many positions as possible, considering that each operation can overwrite previous operations.

This seems tricky. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the maximum possible sum again. If I could set every a[i][j] to n, the sum would be n^3, but is that achievable?

Given that each row or column operation sets a whole row or column to a permutation, meaning that in any single row or column, the numbers are spread out from 1 to n. So, it's impossible to have all n's in the matrix using these operations.

Wait, but maybe not all positions can be set to n, but perhaps I can set some positions to n, others to lower numbers in a way that maximizes the total sum.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula to calculate the maximum possible sum without worrying about the operations.

Let me try to think differently. Suppose I perform operations in such a way that I maximize the number of high values in the matrix.

One idea is to prioritize setting the highest values in positions that are least overwritten by subsequent operations.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to look for a pattern or a formula that directly gives me the maximum sum for a given n.

Looking back at the example provided, when n=1, the maximum sum is 1, and when n=2, it's 7. Let's see if there's a pattern here.

For n=1:

Maximum sum s=1, with 1 operation.

For n=2:

Maximum sum s=7, with 3 operations.

Let me try to find a general formula for the maximum sum.

Let's consider the sum s for general n.

If I perform operations in a certain way, what's the highest sum I can achieve?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula based on n that gives the maximum sum.

Looking at the example, for n=1, s=1; for n=2, s=7.

Let me see if I can find a pattern:

n=1: 1

n=2: 7

n=3: ?

n=4: ?

Wait, I don't know for n=3 and above, but perhaps I can try to compute s for n=3 and see if I can find a pattern.

If I have n=3, and I perform operations, what's the maximum sum?

Let's try to think about it.

If I perform operations to set rows and columns with permutations, aiming to have as many high numbers as possible in the matrix.

Suppose I set row 1 to [3,2,1], row 2 to [3,2,1], and row 3 to [3,2,1]. But wait, each row must be a permutation, so that's allowed, but then if I don't set any column operations, the matrix would be:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum would be 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 3*(3+2+1) = 18.

But maybe I can do better by setting some column operations.

Alternatively, if I set columns to [3,2,1], [3,2,1], [3,2,1], then the matrix would be:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Sum would be 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1 = 3*(3+2+1) = 18 again.

So, in both cases, sum is 18.

Is there a way to get a higher sum than 18 for n=3?

Wait, perhaps if I combine row and column operations.

For example, set row 1 to [3,2,1], then set column 1 to [3,2,1].

So, first set row 1 to [3,2,1], matrix is:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Then set column 1 to [3,2,1], so matrix becomes:

3 2 1

2 0 0

1 0 0

Sum is 3+2+1 + 2 + 1 = 9, which is less than 18. Not better.

Alternatively, set row 1 to [3,2,1], row 2 to [3,2,1], row 3 to [3,2,1], then set column 1 to [3,2,1].

Matrix becomes:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum is 3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1 = 15, which is less than 18.

Another attempt: set row 1 to [3,2,1], column 1 to [3,2,1], row 2 to [3,2,1], column 2 to [3,2,1], etc.

But this seems messy and doesn't necessarily lead to a higher sum.

Perhaps 18 is the maximum for n=3.

Wait, but for n=2, the maximum is 7, which is less than 2^3=8, but higher than n^2*(n+1)/2 = 4*3/2=6.

Similarly, for n=3, 18 is equal to 3*(3+1)/2 * 3 = 3*6=18.

Wait, n^2*(n+1)/2 = 9*4/2=18.

So, is the maximum sum n^2*(n+1)/2?

But in the example for n=2, 2^2*(2+1)/2=4*3/2=6, but the maximum is 7, which is higher.

Wait, that's interesting. So for n=2, n^2*(n+1)/2=6, but the maximum is 7.

That means my earlier assumption is wrong.

So, perhaps there is a better way to arrange the operations to get a higher sum.

Looking back at n=2 example:

Operations:

1 1 1 2 (set row 1 to [1,2])

1 2 1 2 (set row 2 to [1,2])

2 1 1 2 (set column 1 to [1,2])

Let's see what the matrix looks like after these operations.

Initially:

0 0

0 0

After op1: set row 1 to [1,2]

1 2

0 0

After op2: set row 2 to [1,2]

1 2

1 2

After op3: set column 1 to [1,2]

So, column 1 is set to [1,2], meaning a[1][1]=1, a[2][1]=2.

So, matrix becomes:

1 2

2 2

Sum is 1+2+2+2=7, which matches the example.

But according to my earlier approach, if I set all rows to [2,1], I get:

2 1

2 1

Sum=6, which is less than 7.

So, by setting rows and then adjusting columns, I can get a higher sum.

Similarly, for n=3, maybe I can get a sum higher than 18.

Wait, but in n=2, the maximum is 7, which is higher than n^2*(n+1)/2=6.

So, perhaps the formula is different.

Let me try to find a general formula for the maximum sum.

Looking back at n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: let's see, perhaps it's n*(n^2+1)/2.

Wait, for n=1: 1*(1+1)/2=1, matches.

n=2: 2*(8)/2=8, but example shows 7, so no.

Wait, perhaps it's n*n*(n+1)/2.

For n=1: 1*1*2/2=1, matches.

n=2: 2*2*3/2=6, but example shows 7, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n*(n^2+1)/2.

For n=1: 1*(1+1)/2=1, matches.

n=2: 2*(4+1)/2=5, which is less than 7.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n*n*(n+1)/2 - something.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Each operation sets a row or column to a permutation, and operations can overwrite each other.

I need to maximize the sum, so I want the highest possible numbers in as many positions as possible.

But since operations can overwrite each other, I need to arrange them in a way that minimizes the overwriting of higher numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to cover the matrix with row and column operations such that most positions get set to higher numbers.

Wait, perhaps thinking in terms of graph theory or something similar would help, but that might be overkill.

Let me look for a pattern in the example.

For n=2:

Operations:

1 1 1 2 (set row 1 to [1,2])

1 2 1 2 (set row 2 to [1,2])

2 1 1 2 (set column 1 to [1,2])

Resulting matrix:

1 2

2 2

Sum=7.

If I had set column 2 instead of column 1 in the last operation, what would happen?

Set column 2 to [1,2]:

After setting row 1 to [1,2], row 2 to [1,2], then set column 2 to [1,2]:

Matrix:

1 1

1 2

Sum=5, which is less than 7.

So, setting column 1 to [1,2] is better.

Alternatively, if I set column 1 to [2,1]:

After setting row 1 to [1,2], row 2 to [1,2], then set column 1 to [2,1]:

Matrix:

2 2

1 2

Sum=7, same as before.

So, choosing different permutations can give the same sum.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by setting rows and columns in a specific way to maximize the higher numbers in the matrix.

Maybe I can think of it as covering the matrix with row and column operations, prioritizing setting higher numbers in positions that are less likely to be overwritten.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of operations affecting each cell.

Each cell can be affected by at most one row operation and one column operation, with the last operation determining its value.

So, to maximize the sum, I should aim to set higher numbers in positions that are set by only one operation, or ensure that when a cell is set by both a row and a column operation, the higher value prevails.

Wait, but since the last operation overwrites previous ones, I need to ensure that the last operation sets a higher number.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that with 2n operations, I can set all rows and all columns.

But since n operations can set all rows, and another n operations can set all columns, but there will be overlaps.

Wait, but in reality, setting all rows and all columns may not be necessary, as some operations might be redundant.

Perhaps there's a way to cover the matrix with fewer operations.

But the problem allows up to 2n operations, and I need to use no more than that.

Given that, perhaps the optimal strategy is to set all rows to a specific permutation and then set specific columns to override certain cells to higher values.

Wait, but in the n=2 example, setting two rows and one column gives a sum of 7.

Similarly, for n=3, perhaps setting all rows and then setting some columns can achieve a higher sum.

Wait, perhaps there's a formula for the maximum sum.

Let me try to find a general formula.

Looking back at n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: ?

If I assume that for n=3, the maximum sum is 20, for example, but I need to verify.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I set all rows to [n, n-1, ..., 1], meaning the highest number in the first column, decreasing thereafter.

Then, the sum would be n * sum from 1 to n, which is n * n*(n+1)/2 = n^2*(n+1)/2.

But in the n=2 case, that would be 2*2*(3)/2=6, but the example shows 7, which is higher.

So, there must be a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps if I set some columns after setting rows, I can increase the sum.

Wait, in the n=2 example, by setting two rows and one column, the sum increases to 7.

Similarly, for n=3, perhaps setting all three rows and two columns can achieve a higher sum.

Let me try to calculate for n=3.

Set rows 1,2,3 to [3,2,1], then set columns 1 and 2 to [3,2,1].

Matrix after row operations:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Then set column 1 to [3,2,1]:

a[1][1]=3, a[2][1]=2, a[3][1]=1

Matrix:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum=3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1=15, which is less than 18.

Wait, but earlier, setting only rows gave me 18.

So perhaps setting columns after rows decreases the sum.

Alternatively, maybe setting columns first and then rows.

Set columns 1,2,3 to [3,2,1], then set rows 1 and 2 to [3,2,1].

After setting columns:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Then set row 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

2 2 2

1 1 1

Sum=3+2+1 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1=15, again less than 18.

Set rows 1 and 2 to [3,2,1], then set columns 1 and 2 to [3,2,1]:

After setting rows 1 and 2:

3 2 1

3 2 1

0 0 0

Then set columns 1 and 2 to [3,2,1]:

Set column 1 to [3,2,1]:

a[1][1]=3, a[2][1]=2, a[3][1]=1

Matrix:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 0 0

Then set column 2 to [3,2,1]:

a[1][2]=3, a[2][2]=2, a[3][2]=1

Matrix:

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 1 0

Sum=3+3+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+1+0=14, which is less than 18.

So, again, less than 18.

Therefore, perhaps 18 is the maximum sum for n=3.

Wait, but for n=2, the maximum is 7, which is higher than n^2*(n+1)/2=6.

Wait, no, in n=2, n^2*(n+1)/2=4*3/2=6, but the maximum is 7.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps if I set rows and columns in a specific order, I can get a higher sum.

Let me try for n=2.

First, set row 1 to [2,1]:

2 1

0 0

Then set column 1 to [2,1]:

2 1

1 0

Then set row 2 to [2,1]:

2 1

2 1

Sum=2+1+2+1=6, which is equal to n^2*(n+1)/2=6, but the example shows 7.

Wait, but in the example, they set rows 1 and 2 to [1,2], then set column 1 to [1,2], resulting in:

1 2

2 2

Sum=7.

So, by setting rows to [1,2] and column to [1,2], they get 7.

Wait, but if I set rows to [2,1] and column to [2,1], I get 6.

So, perhaps the order of the permutation matters.

Wait, in the example, they set rows to [1,2] and column to [1,2], getting 7.

If I set rows to [2,1] and column to [2,1], I get 6.

Is there a way to set permutations to get higher than 7?

Let me try setting row 1 to [2,1], row 2 to [1,2], and column 1 to [2,1].

After setting row 1 to [2,1]:

2 1

0 0

Set row 2 to [1,2]:

1 2

Then set column 1 to [2,1]:

2 1

1 2

Sum=2+1+1+2=6, which is less than 7.

Alternatively, set row 1 to [2,1], column 1 to [2,1], and column 2 to [2,1]:

After row 1: [2,1]

After column 1: [2,1]

Set column 2 to [2,1]:

2 2

1 1

Sum=2+2+1+1=6, still less than 7.

Wait, how does the example achieve 7?

In the example, operations are:

1 1 1 2 (set row 1 to [1,2])

1 2 1 2 (set row 2 to [1,2])

2 1 1 2 (set column 1 to [1,2])

After op1: row 1 = [1,2]

Matrix:

1 2

0 0

After op2: row 2 = [1,2]

Matrix:

1 2

1 2

After op3: column 1 = [1,2]

Matrix:

1 2

2 2

Sum=1+2+2+2=7.

So, by setting rows to [1,2] and then column 1 to [1,2], they overwrite a[2][1] from 1 to 2, increasing the sum by 1.

Similarly, perhaps for n=3, I can arrange operations to get a higher sum than 18.

Wait, but in n=3, 18 seems to be the maximum, as setting all rows to [3,2,1] gives sum=18, and any column operations seem to decrease the sum.

Wait, maybe for n=3, 18 is indeed the maximum, but for n=2, 7 is possible.

So perhaps for general n, the maximum sum is n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2).

Wait, for n=1: 1 + 0 =1

n=2: 6 +1=7

n=3: 18 +1=19, but earlier attempts only gave me 18.

Wait, perhaps for n=3, 19 is possible.

Let me try.

Set row 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Set row 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

0 0 0

Set column 1 to [3,3,1]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 0 0

Set column 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

3 2 1

1 1 0

Sum=3+3+1 +3+2+1 +1+1+0=15, which is less than 18.

Alternatively, set row 1 to [3,2,1], row 2 to [3,2,1], row 3 to [3,2,1], column 1 to [3,3,3]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

After setting column 1 to [3,3,3]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum=18.

Still the same.

Wait, perhaps 18 is indeed the maximum for n=3.

But for n=2, 7 is achievable, which is higher than 6.

So, perhaps for even n, the maximum sum is n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2), and for odd n, it's n^2*(n+1)/2.

Wait, for n=1 (odd): 1 +0=1

n=2 (even): 6 +1=7

n=3 (odd): 18 +0=18

But 18 is higher than 18 +0=18, so perhaps that's the maximum.

Wait, perhaps the formula is n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2).

For n=1: 1 +0=1

n=2: 6 +1=7

n=3: 18 +1=19

But in practice, for n=3, I couldn't get more than 18.

So perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2)*(ceil(n/2)).

For n=1: 1 +0=1

n=2: 6 +1=7

n=3: 18 +1*2=20

But again, in practice, I can't get more than 18.

So perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2).

For n=1: 1 +0=1

n=2: 6 +1=7

n=3: 18 +1=19

But again, in practice, 18 seems to be the maximum for n=3.

Wait, maybe the formula is n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2)^2.

For n=1: 1 +0=1

n=2: 6 +1=7

n=3: 18 +1=19

Still, can't achieve 19 for n=3.

Perhaps I need to accept that for n=3, 18 is the maximum sum.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is n^3 - floor(n/2).

For n=1: 1 -0=1

n=2: 8 -1=7

n=3: 27 -1=26, which is higher than 18, but I can't achieve 26.

So, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - ceil(n^2/2).

For n=1:1 -1=0, which is less than 1.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - floor(n^3/2).

For n=1:1 -0=1

n=2:8 -4=4, less than 7.

Not matching.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that for even n, the maximum sum is n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2), and for odd n, it's n^2*(n+1)/2.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, for n=4:

If n=4, n^2*(n+1)/2 = 16*5/2=40

Plus floor(4/2)=2, so 40+2=42.

But perhaps it's higher.

Wait, perhaps the general formula is n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2).

For n=1:1 +0=1

n=2:4*3/2 +1=6+1=7

n=3:9*4/2 +1=18+1=19

n=4:16*5/2 +2=40+2=42

But I need to verify if this is achievable.

Wait, perhaps there's a pattern based on the number of operations.

Given that I can perform up to 2n operations, and operations can be on rows or columns.

Perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by setting all rows to [n,n-1,...,1] and then setting floor(n/2) columns to [n,n-1,...,1].

Wait, for n=2:

Set rows 1 and 2 to [2,1], then set column 1 to [2,1], resulting in:

2 1

1 1

Sum=2+1+1+1=5, which is less than 7.

Wait, but earlier, setting rows 1 and 2 to [1,2], then column 1 to [1,2] gives 7.

So, perhaps the permutations should be chosen in a specific way.

Maybe choosing permutations that prioritize higher numbers in positions that are set by column operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose permutations where higher numbers are in positions that are less likely to be overwritten.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing permutations where higher numbers are in positions that are set by column operations.

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to accept that finding a general formula is difficult, and instead look for a pattern in the maximum sums for small n.

Given that for n=1, s=1; n=2, s=7.

Let me try to compute for n=3.

From earlier attempts, it seems that 18 is achievable, but perhaps 19 is possible.

Is there a way to get 19?

Let me try setting rows 1,2,3 to [3,2,1], then set column 1 to [3,2,1], and column 2 to [3,2,1].

Matrix:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum=3+2+1 +2+2+1 +1+2+1=15

Less than 18.

Alternatively, set rows 1 and 2 to [3,2,1], row 3 to [3,2,1], column 1 to [3,2,1], and column 2 to [3,2,1].

Same as above, sum=15.

Wait, perhaps there's no way to get higher than 18 for n=3.

So, perhaps for odd n, the maximum sum is n^2*(n+1)/2, and for even n, it's n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2).

For n=1:1

n=2:6+1=7

n=3:18

n=4:32 +2=34

But I need to verify for n=4.

If n=4, n^2*(n+1)/2=16*5/2=40

Plus floor(4/2)=2, so 42.

Is 42 achievable?

Let's try:

Set rows 1,2,3,4 to [4,3,2,1], then set columns 1 and 2 to [4,3,2,1].

Matrix after rows:

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

Sum=4+3+2+1 +4+3+2+1 +4+3+2+1 +4+3+2+1=4*10=40

Then set column 1 to [4,3,2,1]:

4 3 2 1

3 3 2 1

2 3 2 1

1 3 2 1

Sum=4+3+2+1 +3+3+2+1 +2+3+2+1 +1+3+2+1=4+12+10+7=33, which is less than 40.

Set column 2 to [4,3,2,1]:

4 4 2 1

3 3 2 1

2 2 2 1

1 1 2 1

Sum=4+4+2+1 +3+3+2+1 +2+2+2+1 +1+1+2+1=11+9+7+6=33, again less than 40.

So, perhaps 40 is the maximum for n=4.

Wait, but according to the formula, for even n, it should be n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2)=40+2=42.

But I can't achieve 42.

Perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps for even n, the maximum sum is n^2*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2).

But in practice, for n=2, it's 7, which is 6+1=7, and for n=4, it's 40, which is 40+0=40, but floor(4/2)=2, so 40+2=42, but I can't achieve 42.

So perhaps the formula is different.

This is getting too confusing.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that each operation sets a row or column to a permutation, and the sum is the sum of the maximum values that can be set without being overwritten.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by setting the highest possible values in as many positions as possible, considering the operations' overlaps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the number of operations performed on rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by setting all rows and all columns to the same permutation, but that seems similar to what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is n*(n^2 +1)/2.

For n=1:1

n=2:5

n=3:15

But for n=2, the example shows 7, which is higher than 5.

So, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n*n*(n+1)/2.

For n=1:1

n=2:6

n=3:18

But for n=2, the example shows 7, which is higher than 6.

So, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's n*n*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2).

For n=1:1 +0=1

n=2:6 +1=7

n=3:18 +1=19

n=4:32 +2=34

But for n=3, I can't achieve 19, only 18.

So, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n*n*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2)^2.

For n=1:1 +0=1

n=2:6 +1=7

n=3:18 +1=19

n=4:32 +4=36

But again, for n=3, I can't achieve 19.

Perhaps I need to accept that finding a general formula is difficult, and instead, accept that the maximum sum is n*n*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2).

For n=1:1

n=2:6 +1=7

n=3:18 +1=19

n=4:32 +2=34

And accept that for n=3, 19 might be achievable with a specific arrangement of operations.

Given that, perhaps the general formula is s = n*n*(n+1)/2 + floor(n/2).

Now, in the provided program, it calculates s as n*(n+1)*(4*n -1)/6.

Wait, let's compute that for n=1:1*(2)*(4-1)/6=1*2*3/6=6/6=1, matches.

n=2:2*3*7/6=42/6=7, matches.

n=3:3*4*11/6=132/6=22

Wait, but earlier, for n=3, I couldn't achieve more than 18, but according to this formula, it's 22.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify the formula.

n*(n+1)*(4n -1)/6

For n=1:1*2*3/6=6/6=1

n=2:2*3*7/6=42/6=7

n=3:3*4*11/6=132/6=22

n=4:4*5*15/6=300/6=50

But earlier, for n=2, s=7, which matches, but for n=3, 22 seems higher than what I can achieve.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, and I just haven't found the right sequence of operations to achieve 22 for n=3.

Let me try to see how to achieve 22 for n=3.

Given that n^2*(n+1)/2=18, and the formula gives 22, which is 18 +4.

So, perhaps there's a way to get 22.

Let me think about it.

If I set rows 1,2,3 to [3,2,1], sum=18.

Then, if I set column 1 to [3,2,1], it would change a[1][1] to 3, a[2][1] to 2, a[3][1] to 1, which are already set to 3,2,1 respectively, so no change.

Similarly, setting column 2 to [3,2,1] would change a[1][2] to 3, which was 2, so it increases by 1; a[2][2] to 2, which was 2, no change; a[3][2] to 1, which was 1, no change.

So, sum would be 3+3+1 +3+2+1 +1+1+1=14, which is less than 18.

Alternatively, set column 1 to [1,2,3]:

After setting rows to [3,2,1], set column 1 to [1,2,3]:

a[1][1]=1, a[2][1]=2, a[3][1]=3

Matrix:

1 2 1

2 2 1

3 2 1

Sum=1+2+1 +2+2+1 +3+2+1=13, less than 18.

Set column 2 to [1,2,3]:

a[1][2]=1, a[2][2]=2, a[3][2]=3

Matrix:

1 1 1

2 2 1

3 3 1

Sum=1+1+1 +2+2+1 +3+3+1=15, less than 18.

Wait, perhaps there's no way to get higher than 18.

Alternatively, maybe I need to set rows and columns differently.

Let me try setting row 1 to [3,2,1], row 2 to [3,2,1], row 3 to [3,2,1], column 1 to [3,2,1], column 2 to [3,2,1].

After setting rows:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

After setting column 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

After setting column 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum=3+3+1 +2+2+1 +1+2+1=16, still less than 18.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose different permutations.

Set row 1 to [3,2,1], row 2 to [3,2,1], row 3 to [3,2,1], column 1 to [1,2,3], column 2 to [1,2,3].

After setting rows:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Set column 1 to [1,2,3]:

1 2 1

2 2 1

3 2 1

Set column 2 to [1,2,3]:

1 1 1

2 2 1

3 3 1

Sum=1+1+1 +2+2+1 +3+3+1=14, less than 18.

Still less than 18.

So, perhaps 18 is the maximum achievable sum for n=3.

But according to the formula n*(n+1)*(4n-1)/6, for n=3, it's 3*4*11/6=132/6=22, which is higher than 18.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect, or I'm missing something in my approach.

Wait, maybe the formula is different.

Let me try to compute the formula for n=2: 2*3*7/6=42/6=7, matches the example.

For n=1:1, matches.

For n=3:22, but I can't achieve that.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Suppose that for each operation, I can set a row or column to a permutation, and the sum increases by the sum of that permutation.

But since operations can overwrite each other, the net sum is the sum of the final matrix values.

I need to maximize this sum with no more than 2n operations.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by covering as much of the matrix as possible with operations that set higher numbers.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by performing operations that set the highest possible numbers in the positions that are set by only one operation.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by performing operations that set rows and columns in a way that maximizes the number of positions set to n.

But again, I'm stuck.

Given that, perhaps I need to accept that for n=3, the maximum sum is 18, even though the formula suggests 22.

Wait, perhaps the formula is n*(n+1)*(4n -1)/6, but in practice, it's not achievable with the operations.

But in the example for n=2, it's achievable.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, and I'm just not performing operations optimally for n=3.

Let me try to see how to achieve 22 for n=3.

If I set row 1 to [3,2,1], row 2 to [3,2,1], row 3 to [3,2,1], column 1 to [3,2,1], column 2 to [3,2,1].

As before, sum=16.

Is there a different way?

What if I set row 1 to [3,2,1], column 1 to [3,2,1], row 2 to [3,2,1], column 2 to [3,2,1], row 3 to [3,2,1], column 3 to [3,2,1].

After setting row 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Set column 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

2 0 0

1 0 0

Set row 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 0 0

Set column 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

3 2 1

1 2 0

Set row 3 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Set column 3 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum=3+3+3 +3
