Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

Sasha has an array a1, a2, ..., an, and he wants to rearrange its elements to maximize the "beauty" of the array. The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

So, for example, if the array is [1, 2, 3], the beauty would be (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Another example in the problem: [69, 69, 69], beauty is 0, since (69-69) + (69-69) = 0 + 0 = 0.

And another one: [100, 54, 80, 43, 90], after rearranging, the beauty is 57.

I need to figure out the general way to maximize this beauty.

First, let's understand what this sum represents. It's the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearrangement.

Let's consider the general formula:

Beauty = Σ (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n

= (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1})

If we look closely, this is a telescoping sum, where most terms cancel out:

= an - a1

So, the beauty is simply an - a1, where an and a1 are the last and first elements in the rearranged array.

Wait, that seems too simple. Is that correct?

Let's verify with the examples.

First test case: [2,1,3]. If rearranged as [1,2,3], beauty is 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the example.

Second test case: [69,69,69]. No matter the order, an - a1 = 69 - 69 = 0.

Third test case: [100,54,80,43,90]. To get beauty 57, an - a1 should be 57.

Let's sort the array: [43,54,80,90,100]. If we arrange it as [43,54,80,90,100], beauty is 100 - 43 = 57, which matches.

Wait, but why not arrange it differently? Like [43,100,54,80,90]. Then beauty would be 100 - 43 + 54 - 100 + 80 - 54 + 90 - 80 = 57 -46 + 26 + 10 = 57 -46 = 11 + 26 = 37 + 10 = 47, which is less than 57.

So, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum beauty, which is an - a1.

Wait, but in the first test case, [1,2,3], beauty is 2, which is 3 - 1 = 2.

In the second test case, all elements are equal, so beauty is 0.

In the third test case, [43,54,80,90,100], beauty is 100 - 43 = 57.

So, it seems that arranging the array in ascending order maximizes the beauty, which is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

Wait, but is this always true?

Let me think of another arrangement for the third test case: [43,100,54,80,90].

Beauty: (100 - 43) + (54 - 100) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) = 57 -46 + 26 + 10 = 57 -46 = 11 + 26 = 37 + 10 = 47, which is less than 57.

Another arrangement: [54,80,90,100,43].

Beauty: (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) + (43 - 100) = 26 + 10 + 10 -57 = 46 -57 = -11, which is worse.

Another arrangement: [43,54,80,90,100], beauty = 100 - 43 = 57.

Seems like arranging in ascending order gives the maximum beauty.

Wait, but why not arrange in descending order?

Let's try [100,90,80,54,43].

Beauty: (90 - 100) + (80 - 90) + (54 - 80) + (43 - 54) = -10 -10 -26 -11 = -57, which is worse than 57.

So, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum beauty, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

Let me check with another example.

Test case: [3,4,3,3].

If arranged as [3,3,3,4], beauty = 4 - 3 = 1.

If arranged as [3,4,3,3], beauty = 4 - 3 + 3 - 4 + 3 - 3 = 1 -1 + 0 = 0.

If arranged as [4,3,3,3], beauty = 3 - 4 + 3 - 3 + 3 - 3 = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1.

So, the maximum beauty is 1, achieved by arranging in ascending order.

Another test case: [2,1].

Arranged as [1,2], beauty = 2 - 1 = 1.

Arranged as [2,1], beauty = 1 - 2 = -1.

So, maximum beauty is 1.

Hence, it seems that the maximum beauty is always the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

Therefore, to maximize the beauty, we just need to sort the array in ascending order and subtract the first element from the last element.

So, the beauty is max(a) - min(a).

Wait, but in the code provided, it sorts the array and prints the sorted array.

But according to the problem, we need to output the maximum beauty, which is max(a) - min(a).

But in the code, it's sorting the array and printing the sorted array.

Wait, let's look at the code again.

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))

print(' '.join(ar))

This code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, reads the array, sorts it, converts it to strings, and prints the sorted array.

But according to the problem, we need to output a single integer for each test case, which is the maximum beauty, i.e., max(a) - min(a).

But in the code, it's printing the sorted array.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something.

Let me check the problem statement again.

"output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array a that can be obtained."

But in the code, it's printing the sorted array.

This doesn't match.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Let me check the example again.

In the first test case, the sorted array is [1,2,3], and the beauty is 2, which is 3 - 1.

But the code prints "1 2 3", which is not the required output.

The required output should be "2", not "1 2 3".

Similarly, in the second test case, the sorted array is [69,69,69], and the beauty is 0.

But the code would print "69 69 69", but the required output is "0".

Hence, the code is incorrect.

It seems that the code is sorting the array and printing it, which is not what is asked.

The problem asks for the maximum beauty, which is max(a) - min(a), not the sorted array.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

To fix the code, it should compute max(a) - min(a) for each test case and print that.

Here's the corrected code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

ar = list(map(int, input().split()))

beauty = max(ar) - min(ar)

print(beauty)

This would correctly compute the maximum beauty for each test case.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
