Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have n disks in a plane, each with integer coordinates for their centers and positive integer radii. The key points are:

1. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but they can be tangent to each other.

2. I need to determine if it's possible to change the radii of these disks such that:

   a. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

   b. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.

   c. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

3. The new radii can be any positive real numbers, and the centers cannot be changed.

First, I need to understand what it means for disks to be tangent. If two disks are tangent, it means they touch at exactly one point. Mathematically, for two disks with centers at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and radii r1 and r2, respectively, they are tangent if the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii:

√((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) = r1 + r2

Given that, the problem allows me to adjust the radii as long as this condition is maintained for tangent disks, and no new overlaps are created.

My goal is to decrease the sum of all radii while satisfying these conditions.

I need to think about how the radii can be adjusted.

Let's consider that for tangent disks, their radii must sum to the fixed distance between their centers. So, if two disks are tangent, their radii are linked by this equation.

If I have a group of disks where some are tangent to each other, forming a connected component, then the radii within this component are interdependent.

Perhaps I can model this as a system of equations, where each tangency condition imposes an equality constraint on the sum of radii of the involved disks.

Then, I need to see if I can adjust the radii within these constraints to achieve a strictly smaller total sum.

I should also consider that the disks are given to be without positive area overlap, meaning that non-tangent disks are separated by a distance greater than the sum of their radii.

For such disks, their radii can be adjusted independently, as long as the new radii keep them non-overlapping.

But the problem is to adjust all radii together, potentially across different connected components.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the graph where disks are nodes, and edges connect tangent disks.

Then, each connected component in this graph represents a set of disks whose radii are interdependent through the tangency constraints.

Within a connected component, changing one radius may affect the others due to the constraints.

So, for each connected component, I need to see if I can adjust the radii to satisfy the conditions.

Let me consider a single connected component first.

Suppose I have a connected component with k disks.

I have k variables (the new radii), and for each tangency, I have an equation of the form r_i + r_j = d_ij, where d_ij is the distance between centers of disks i and j.

This system of equations can be represented in matrix form.

The question is whether I can find a solution to this system where the sum of the new radii is strictly less than the sum of the original radii, and all new radii are positive.

In other words, I need to check if the system has a solution with ∑r'_i < ∑r_i, and r'_i > 0 for all i.

First, I need to determine if the system of equations has a solution at all.

Given that the disks are initially non-overlapping and only tangent where specified, the system should be consistent.

Now, I need to see if I can adjust the radii within the constraints to decrease the total sum.

I recall that in systems of linear equations, if there are free variables, I can adjust them to achieve different sums.

Perhaps I can think in terms of degrees of freedom within each connected component.

If a connected component has k disks and e tangency constraints, then the number of independent variables (degrees of freedom) is k - e.

Wait, more precisely, each tangency constraint reduces the number of independent variables by 1.

So, the number of free variables is k - e, assuming the system is independent.

Then, for each connected component, I can adjust the radii by assigning values to these free variables, and the other radii are determined by the constraints.

My goal is to choose these free variables in a way that decreases the total sum of radii, while keeping all radii positive.

This seems manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a system where I set one radius and solve for the others.

Wait, maybe I can fix one radius in each connected component and solve for the others.

Then, I can see if I can choose the fixed radius small enough to decrease the total sum, without making any radius non-positive.

This might be a way to approach it.

Let me try to formalize this.

For each connected component, choose one disk as a reference and fix its radius, then solve for the others based on the tangency constraints.

Then, see if I can choose the reference radius small enough to decrease the total sum, without making any other radius non-positive.

But this might be too vague.

Let me consider a simple example.

Suppose I have two disks that are tangent to each other.

Then, r1 + r2 = d, where d is the distance between their centers.

If I want to decrease the sum r1 + r2, but it's already equal to d, the only way is to make r1 + r2 < d.

But that would mean the disks are no longer tangent and are actually separated, which violates the condition that tangent disks must remain tangent.

Wait, no. The problem says that disks that were tangent remain tangent, and no two disks overlap in a positive area.

So, for tangent disks, their new radii must still satisfy r1 + r2 = d.

For non-tangent disks, their new radii must satisfy r1 + r2 <= d, to avoid positive area overlap.

But the problem allows for no positive area overlap, meaning that non-tangent disks can be separated or just tangent.

But in this problem, we are to adjust radii such that tangent disks remain tangent, and non-tangent disks do not overlap.

So, for tangent disks, r1 + r2 = d.

For non-tangent disks, r1 + r2 <= d.

My goal is to decrease the sum of all radii while maintaining these conditions.

Now, if I look at a connected component of disks where disks are tangent to each other, forming a graph, within that component, the radii are interdependent through the tangency constraints.

For disks in different components, their radii can be adjusted independently, as they don't affect each other directly.

So, I need to consider each connected component separately.

Within a connected component, the system of equations from the tangency constraints may have a certain number of degrees of freedom.

I need to see if I can adjust the free variables to decrease the total sum of radii, while keeping all radii positive.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra.

Let's say I have a connected component with k disks and e tangency constraints.

I can set up e equations of the form r_i + r_j = d_ij.

This is a system of linear equations.

I need to solve for r_i's.

The number of independent equations is less than or equal to k-1, assuming the graph is connected.

Then, the number of free variables is k - (number of independent equations).

In a tree structure, number of independent equations is k-1, so one free variable.

In a cycle, it might be less.

Wait, actually, in a connected graph with k nodes and e edges, the number of independent equations is e - (k - 1), if there are cycles.

Wait, no. In linear algebra terms, the number of independent equations depends on the rank of the coefficient matrix.

This might be getting too complicated.

Perhaps a better approach is to consider that in a connected component, the radii are determined up to a certain freedom.

If I can find that in at least one connected component, I can adjust the radii to decrease the sum, then the answer is YES; otherwise, NO.

Now, how do I determine if such an adjustment is possible in a connected component?

Let me consider that in a connected component, the radii are related by the tangency constraints.

I can model this as a system of equations.

Let's consider assigning variables to the radii and setting up equations based on tangency.

Then, I can solve the system and see if there's a solution where the sum of radii is less than the original sum, and all radii are positive.

This seems involved.

Maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

I recall that in such systems, if there's a cycle in the graph, it might impose additional constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the graph formed by the tangent disks.

Each disk is a node, and a tangency is an edge.

Then, for each connected component, I can analyze the possibilities.

In particular, in a tree structure, there are no cycles, and I have more freedom to adjust radii.

In a cycle, the constraints might be more restrictive.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the concept of a "stress" in graph theory, where I assign values to vertices (radii) such that certain edge constraints are satisfied.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a connected component, I can adjust the radii by adding the same value to all radii, or something like that.

Wait, no, that wouldn't help because adding the same value would increase the sum.

I need to decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps I can adjust the radii by scaling them uniformly by a factor less than 1, but that might not preserve the tangency conditions.

No, that's not suitable.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a connected component with disks connected by tangency.

I can choose one disk and fix its radius, then solve for the others based on the tangency constraints.

Then, I can compute the total sum and see if I can choose the fixed radius small enough to decrease the sum, without making any radius non-positive.

This seems promising.

Let's formalize this.

Select one disk in the component and fix its new radius to some value r.

Then, using the tangency constraints, determine the new radii of the other disks in the component.

For example, if disk A is tangent to disk B, and I fix r_A, then r_B is determined as r_B = d_AB - r_A, where d_AB is the distance between centers of A and B.

Similarly, if disk B is tangent to disk C, then r_C = d_BC - r_B, and so on.

I need to propagate this throughout the connected component.

Now, I need to choose r_A such that, when I compute all other r_i's based on the tangency constraints, all r_i's are positive, and the total sum is less than the original sum.

This seems feasible.

I can try to choose r_A as small as possible, but I need to ensure that all other r_i's remain positive.

Wait, but how do I ensure that all r_i's remain positive?

I need to find the range of possible values for r_A such that all r_i's are positive.

Then, within that range, check if I can choose r_A such that the total sum decreases.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose I have three disks A, B, and C, connected in a line by tangency: A-B-C.

Let's say d_AB and d_BC are the distances between their centers.

If I fix r_A, then r_B = d_AB - r_A.

Then r_C = d_BC - r_B = d_BC - (d_AB - r_A) = d_BC - d_AB + r_A.

I need r_B > 0 and r_C > 0.

So:

d_AB - r_A > 0 ⇒ r_A < d_AB

d_BC - d_AB + r_A > 0 ⇒ r_A > d_AB - d_BC

Assuming d_AB > d_BC - d_AB + r_A, but I need to make sure all r_i's are positive.

Wait, I need:

r_A < d_AB

and

r_A > d_AB - d_BC

Assuming d_AB - d_BC < d_AB, which is true if d_BC > 0.

So, r_A can be chosen in the range (d_AB - d_BC, d_AB).

Then, the sum S = r_A + r_B + r_C = r_A + (d_AB - r_A) + (d_BC - d_AB + r_A) = d_AB - r_A + d_BC - d_AB + r_A = d_BC

Wait, that's interesting. The sum simplifies to d_BC, which is constant.

So, in this case, no matter what r_A I choose within the valid range, the total sum of radii remains constant.

That suggests that in this configuration, I cannot decrease the sum of radii.

Wait, but the problem allows for decreasing the sum strictly.

So, in this case, it's not possible.

But maybe in other configurations, it is possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to generalize this.

In a tree structure, the sum of radii might be fixed, as seen in the example above.

But what if there are cycles?

In a cycle, the constraints might be such that the sum can be adjusted.

Wait, in a cycle, the constraints might impose that the sum is fixed as well.

Let me consider a simple cycle of three disks: A-B-C-A.

Each pair is tangent: A and B, B and C, C and A.

Then, from A and B: r_A + r_B = d_AB

From B and C: r_B + r_C = d_BC

From C and A: r_C + r_A = d_CA

This is a system of three equations with three variables.

I can solve for r_A, r_B, r_C in terms of d_AB, d_BC, d_CA.

Adding all three equations: 2(r_A + r_B + r_C) = d_AB + d_BC + d_CA

So, r_A + r_B + r_C = (d_AB + d_BC + d_CA)/2

Thus, the sum of radii is fixed by the distances between centers.

Therefore, in this case, the sum cannot be decreased.

Wait, but maybe in some cases, it can be.

Wait, no. If the sum is fixed by the distances, then it cannot be changed.

So, in connected components that form cycles, the sum of radii is fixed.

In connected components that are trees, the sum might be fixed as well, as seen in the previous example.

Wait, in the previous tree example with three disks in a line, the sum was fixed to d_BC.

In the cycle example, the sum was (d_AB + d_BC + d_CA)/2.

So, in both cases, the sum is fixed by the distances between centers.

Therefore, in any connected component, the sum of radii is determined by the distances between centers and the structure of the connections.

Hence, it's not possible to decrease the sum of radii in any connected component without violating the tangency conditions or making some radii non-positive.

Wait, but the problem mentions that it's possible to change the radii in such a way that the sum decreases, under the given conditions.

But according to my reasoning, the sum is fixed by the constraints.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me think again.

Suppose I have two disks that are tangent: A and B, with d_AB = r_A + r_B.

If I decrease r_A by some amount, I have to increase r_B by the same amount to maintain the tangency.

In this case, the sum r_A + r_B remains the same.

Similarly, in larger connected components, adjusting one radius affects the others in such a way that the total sum remains constant.

Therefore, it seems impossible to decrease the sum of radii across any connected component.

But the problem says to print "YES" if it's possible to decrease the sum strictly, and "NO" otherwise.

Given my reasoning, it seems that the sum cannot be decreased in any connected component.

However, perhaps there is a way to decrease the sum by adjusting radii in different connected components in a coordinated way.

Wait, but each connected component is independent in terms of radius adjustments, as long as the constraints within each component are satisfied.

Therefore, for each connected component, the sum of radii is fixed by the constraints within that component.

Thus, the total sum of radii across all components is the sum of the fixed sums for each component.

Therefore, it seems that the total sum is fixed and cannot be decreased.

But the problem has examples where the answer is "YES" and "NO".

In the first sample input, there are five disks, and the answer is "YES", meaning it's possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining the conditions.

But according to my reasoning, the sum should be fixed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me look back at the first sample input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

Assuming that some of these disks are tangent to each other, forming connected components.

Perhaps there are multiple connected components, and within each, the sum is fixed, but overall, by adjusting radii across components, the total sum can be decreased.

Wait, but how?

If each component has a fixed sum, how can adjusting radii across components decrease the total sum?

I must be misunderstanding something.

Let me consider that non-tangent disks can have their radii adjusted independently, as long as they don't start overlapping.

But the problem requires that tangent disks remain tangent, and non-tangent disks do not overlap.

So, within a connected component, the radii are interdependent, but between components, they can be adjusted independently, as long as they don't start overlapping.

Wait, perhaps in some cases, adjusting radii in one component can allow for radii adjustments in another component.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have two separate connected components that are not connected to each other.

In each component, the sum of radii is fixed by the tangency constraints within that component.

Then, the total sum is just the sum of the fixed sums of each component.

In this case, I cannot decrease the total sum.

However, perhaps if there are overlapping or interacting components, there might be a way to adjust radii across components to decrease the total sum.

But according to the problem statement, disks from different components do not overlap and are not tangent.

Therefore, their radii can be adjusted independently, as long as they don't start overlapping.

But if they are not tangent and not overlapping initially, and I adjust their radii without making them tangent or overlapping, then the sums within each component are still fixed.

This is getting confusing.

Maybe I need to consider that in some configurations, there is some flexibility to decrease the radii without violating the conditions.

Let me consider a simple case with two disks that are not tangent.

Suppose I have two disks that are separated, not tangent.

Then, I can decrease their radii as long as they don't become tangent or overlap.

In this case, I can decrease both radii independently, as long as r1 + r2 < d, where d is the distance between centers.

Therefore, in this case, I can decrease the sum of radii.

But in the problem, it says that disks may be tangent or not, and tangent disks must remain tangent.

In the case where disks are not tangent, I can decrease their radii independently, as long as they don't start touching.

Therefore, for disconnected components, I can adjust their radii independently, as long as they remain non-overlapping.

So, if I have multiple connected components that are not connected to each other, I can decrease the radii in some components, as long as the sum decreases overall.

Wait, but in each connected component, the sum is fixed, as per the earlier reasoning.

Wait, no, in a connected component where disks are tangent, the sum is fixed.

In a connected component where disks are not tangent, meaning they are separated, their radii can be decreased independently, as long as they don't start overlapping.

Wait, but if they are not tangent and not overlapping, they are in separate connected components, and I can decrease their radii independently.

Therefore, for each connected component, if it's a single disk not tangent to any other, I can decrease its radius as long as it doesn't become zero or negative.

If it's a connected component with multiple disks tangent to each other, then the sum of radii is fixed, as per earlier reasoning.

Therefore, for single disks without any tangencies, I can decrease their radii, thus decreasing the total sum.

In such a case, the answer would be "YES", because I can decrease the radii of isolated disks.

However, in connected components with multiple tangent disks, the sum of radii is fixed, so I cannot decrease the sum for that component.

Therefore, if there exists at least one connected component that consists of a single disk, then I can decrease its radius, thus decreasing the total sum, and the answer is "YES".

If all connected components have multiple disks, then I cannot decrease the total sum, and the answer is "NO".

Wait, but in the first sample input, there are five disks, and the answer is "YES", which suggests that there is at least one connected component that is a single disk or can be adjusted to decrease the sum.

But according to the explanation, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disks by 0.5 and increase the second disk's radius by 0.5.

This way, the sum decreases by 0.5.

Wait, how does that work?

Let me look at the sample input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

Assuming that some of these disks are tangent.

From the explanation, it seems that the first and third disks are tangent to the second disk, and possibly others.

In this case, adjusting their radii in a way that the sum decreases requires that the sum of radii in the connected component can be decreased.

But according to my earlier reasoning, in a connected component, the sum is fixed.

However, in this sample, it's possible to decrease the sum.

Therefore, my earlier reasoning must be flawed.

Perhaps I need to consider that in some connected components, the sum is not necessarily fixed.

Let me consider the connected components in the first sample.

Suppose disks 1 and 2 are tangent, disks 2 and 3 are tangent, and disks 4 and 5 are tangent.

Then, there are two connected components: {1,2,3} and {4,5}.

In the explanation, they decrease the radii of disks 1 and 3 by 0.5 and increase the radius of disk 2 by 0.5.

This results in the sum decreasing by 0.5.

Wait, how is this possible if the sum in each connected component is fixed?

Let me calculate the sum for the first connected component: {1,2,3}.

Suppose initially, r1 + r2 + r3 = some value.

After adjustment, r1' = r1 - 0.5, r2' = r2 + 0.5, r3' = r3 - 0.5.

Then, the new sum is (r1 - 0.5) + r2' + (r3 - 0.5) = r1 + r2' + r3 -1.

But they claim that the sum decreases by 0.5, which suggests that r2' = r2 + 0.5.

Wait, but according to the tangency constraints, if disks 1 and 2 are tangent, then r1 + r2 = d12.

Similarly, disks 2 and 3 are tangent, so r2 + r3 = d23.

After adjustment, r1' + r2' = d12 and r2' + r3' = d23.

Given r1' = r1 - 0.5, r3' = r3 - 0.5, and r2' = r2 + 0.5.

Then:

(r1 - 0.5) + (r2 + 0.5) = r1 + r2 = d12

(r2 + 0.5) + (r3 - 0.5) = r2 + r3 = d23

So, the tangency conditions are maintained.

And the sum is (r1 - 0.5) + (r2 + 0.5) + (r3 - 0.5) = r1 + r2 + r3 - 0.5, which is indeed a decrease of 0.5.

So, in this case, even though the sum seemed fixed, it was possible to decrease it by adjusting the radii in this way.

This contradicts my earlier assumption that the sum is fixed in connected components.

Therefore, my understanding was incorrect.

Let me try to find a general approach.

Perhaps, in a connected component, the sum of radii is not necessarily fixed, and there is some flexibility to adjust it.

In the earlier example with three disks in a line, A-B-C, I thought the sum was fixed, but the sample shows that it's possible to decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps in that case, the sum is not fixed.

Let me consider the general case.

In a connected component with k disks and e tangency constraints, the system of equations is:

For each tangency, r_i + r_j = d_ij.

This is a system of linear equations.

The number of equations is e, and the number of variables is k.

The rank of the coefficient matrix is at most k, but depending on the structure, it could be less.

In particular, for a connected graph, the rank is k - 1, because the sum of all r_i is determined by the distances.

Wait, in a connected graph with k nodes, the system r_i + r_j = d_ij for each edge has rank k - 1, meaning that one variable can be chosen freely, and the others are determined accordingly.

Therefore, in a connected component with k disks and e edges, the sum of radii can be expressed as a linear function of one free variable.

Therefore, I can adjust that free variable to decrease the sum, as long as all radii remain positive.

Therefore, for each connected component, I can adjust the sum of radii by adjusting the free variable within its valid range.

If I can find a connected component where adjusting the free variable can lead to a decrease in the sum without making any radius non-positive, then the answer is "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Therefore, to solve the problem, I need to:

1. Build the graph where disks are nodes, and edges connect tangent disks.

2. Identify the connected components.

3. For each connected component, determine if it's possible to adjust the radii by varying one free variable to decrease the sum while keeping all radii positive.

4. If any connected component allows such an adjustment, output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Now, I need to implement this logic.

First, I need to build the graph.

I can represent the graph using adjacency lists.

Then, I can perform DFS or BFS to identify the connected components.

For each connected component, I need to model the system of equations and find if there's a way to decrease the sum.

But implementing a linear system
