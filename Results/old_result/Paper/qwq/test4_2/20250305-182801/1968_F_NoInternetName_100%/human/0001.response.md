Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array of numbers, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting subarray is one that can be divided into at least two parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR is. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is asking whether a subarray from index l to r can be split into at least two consecutive segments where each segment's XOR is equal.

I need to think about how to efficiently check this for multiple queries because n and q can be up to 2*10^5, which is quite large. So, any solution that's not efficient enough will not work.

Let me recall some properties of XOR:

1. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order of operations doesn't matter.

2. The XOR of a subarray from l to r can be calculated using prefix XOR arrays.

Let me define a prefix XOR array, where prefix[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i].

Then, the XOR of a subarray from l to r is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

Given that, the XOR of the entire subarray from l to r is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

Now, the problem is to split this subarray into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let's think about what this means.

Suppose we split the subarray into k parts, each with the same XOR value, say y.

Then, the total XOR from l to r should be y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times).

If k is even, then y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = 0.

If k is odd, then it's y.

But in our problem, k > 1, so:

- If k is even, total XOR should be 0.

- If k is odd, total XOR should be y.

But we don't know k in advance.

Wait, but in our subarray, the total XOR is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

If we can split it into k parts with the same XOR, then:

- If k is even, prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1] should be 0.

- If k is odd, prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1] should be y, where y is the XOR of each part.

But y is also the XOR of each part, which is the same for all parts.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the subarray from l to r.

I need to split it into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR.

Let's consider that the XOR of each part is y.

Then, the total XOR from l to r should be y XOR y XOR ... XOR y.

As I mentioned earlier, if k is even, it's 0, and if k is odd, it's y.

So, in our case, if prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1] = 0, then k can be even, and all parts have XOR y.

If prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1] = y, then k is odd, and each part has XOR y.

But in both cases, y must be equal for all parts.

Wait, but y is the XOR of each part, and we need to find if such a y exists that allows splitting into at least two parts.

This seems a bit confusing.

Let me try to find a different approach.

Maybe I can look for repeated XOR values in the subarray.

Let me consider the prefix XOR from the start of the subarray.

Define prefix_sub[l-1] = prefix[l-1], prefix_sub[l] = prefix[l], ..., prefix_sub[r] = prefix[r].

Then, the XOR of a segment from i to j in the subarray is prefix_sub[j] XOR prefix_sub[i-1].

We need to split the subarray into segments where each segment's XOR is equal.

So, if I fix the XOR value y, then I need to find positions where prefix_sub[i] XOR prefix_sub[i-1] = y for each segment.

But I don't know y in advance.

Wait, perhaps I can find y first.

Let me think about the possible values of y.

Suppose the total XOR from l to r is total_XOR = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

If I split the subarray into k parts with each part having XOR y, then:

- If k is even, total_XOR = 0.

- If k is odd, total_XOR = y.

So, depending on whether k is even or odd, total_XOR is either 0 or y.

But k > 1.

So, if total_XOR = 0, then k can be even.

If total_XOR = y, then k is odd.

But I need to ensure that such a y exists that allows splitting into at least two parts.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of times y appears in the prefix XOR.

Let me consider the prefix XOR values from l-1 to r.

Let me denote prefix_sub = [prefix[l-1], prefix[l], prefix[l+1], ..., prefix[r]].

Now, to split the subarray into parts with XOR y, I need to find positions where the difference between prefix_sub[i] and prefix_sub[i-1] is y.

But since XOR is involved, it's a bit different.

Wait, actually, the XOR of a segment from prefix_sub[i-1] to prefix_sub[j] is prefix_sub[j] XOR prefix_sub[i-1].

So, for each segment, prefix_sub[j] XOR prefix_sub[i-1] = y.

So, for fixed y, I need to find if there are indices i1, j1, i2, j2, ... such that for each segment [i_k, j_k], prefix_sub[j_k] XOR prefix_sub[i_k - 1] = y.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can look for y such that y is the XOR of some segment, and then see if other segments have the same XOR.

But this seems inefficient, especially with large n and q.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that if I can find at least two segments within the subarray that have the same XOR, then maybe I can split them accordingly.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if a value appears multiple times in the prefix XOR array, it indicates that the subarrays between those positions have XOR zero.

But in this problem, we need the XOR of segments to be equal to some y, not necessarily zero.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can fix y and see if the subarray can be split into parts with XOR y.

But iterating over all possible y is not feasible because a_i can be up to 2^30 - 1, which is too large.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that if I fix y, then the positions where prefix_sub[i] = prefix_sub[j] XOR y for some i and j, but this seems too vague.

Another idea: suppose I have the prefix XOR array for the entire array.

Then, for a subarray from l to r, the prefix_sub array is from prefix[l-1] to prefix[r].

Now, if I can find multiple occurrences of the same value in prefix_sub, it might indicate something useful.

Wait, if prefix_sub[i] = prefix_sub[j], then the XOR from i to j-1 is zero.

So, if I can find repeated prefix_sub values, it means there are zero XOR segments.

But in this problem, I need segments with the same XOR, not necessarily zero.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the subarray from l to r, keeping track of the prefix XOR as I go.

Let me denote prefix_XOR[i] as the XOR from l to i.

If I have two positions i and j where prefix_XOR[i] = prefix_XOR[j], then the XOR from i+1 to j is zero.

But I need the XOR from i+1 to j to be equal to some y.

Wait, if I have prefix_XOR[i] XOR prefix_XOR[j] = XOR from i+1 to j.

I need this to be equal to y.

So, prefix_XOR[i] XOR y = prefix_XOR[j].

Therefore, for a fixed y, I need to find if there are multiple pairs of prefix_XOR values that differ by y.

But again, iterating over all possible y is not practical.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that if the total XOR from l to r is y, and I can split the subarray into k parts each with XOR y, then the sum (in XOR sense) of these parts should equal the total XOR.

Wait, but XOR is not like regular addition.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if I can split the subarray into k parts with the same XOR y, then the total XOR is y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, if the total XOR is y and k is odd, or total XOR is 0 and k is even.

Therefore, for a given subarray, if the total XOR is 0, then k can be even, and if the total XOR is y, then k can be odd.

But I need to have at least two parts, so k >= 2.

So, for total XOR = 0, k can be even (2, 4, ...), and for total XOR = y, k can be odd (3, 5, ...).

But I need to ensure that such a k exists, meaning that the subarray can indeed be split into k parts with the same XOR y.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about an example.

Take the first example:

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

Queries:

1. l=1, r=5: subarray [1,1,2,3,0]

We can split it into [1], [1], [2,3,0], each with XOR 1.

So, y=1, and k=3 (which is odd), and total XOR should be y, which is 1.

Wait, but in this case, total XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1.

Yes, which matches y.

Another query:

l=2, r=4: subarray [1,2,3]

We can split it into [1,2],[3], each with XOR 3.

Wait, 1 XOR 2 is 3, and 3 is 3, so y=3, k=2 (even), total XOR should be 0.

Let's check: 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, which matches.

Another query:

l=3, r=5: [2,3,0]

We can't split it into at least two parts with the same XOR.

Total XOR is 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1.

If k is odd, total XOR should be y, which would be 1.

But can we split [2,3,0] into odd number of parts with each part's XOR=1?

Possible splits:

- [2], [3,0]: 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1, which doesn't match.

- [2,3], [0]: 2 XOR 3 = 1, and 0=0, which doesn't match.

- [2], [3], [0]: 2, 3, 0, which are not equal.

So, no.

Another query:

l=1, r=3: [1,1,2]

Possible splits:

- [1], [1,2]: 1, and 1 XOR 2=3, not equal.

- [1,1], [2]: 1 XOR 1=0, and 2=2, not equal.

- [1], [1], [2]: 1,1,2, not equal.

So, not possible.

Another query:

l=3, r=4: [2,3]

Possible splits:

- [2], [3]: 2 and 3, not equal.

So, not possible.

Okay, so in the first two queries, it was possible, and in the last three, it wasn't.

Now, I need a way to generalize this.

Let me think about the condition for a subarray to be interesting.

Given the subarray from l to r, with total XOR = total_XOR.

If total_XOR = 0, then k can be even.

If total_XOR = y, then k can be odd.

But I need to ensure that such a k exists, meaning that there are at least two parts.

So, for total_XOR = 0, k can be any even number >=2.

For total_XOR = y, k can be any odd number >=3.

But I need to confirm if such a split is possible.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there exists at least one index i in [l,r) such that the XOR from l to i is equal to the XOR from i+1 to r.

In other words, prefix[i] XOR prefix[l-1] = prefix[r] XOR prefix[i].

Let me denote prefix[l-1] = pl_minus_1, prefix[i] = pl_to_i, prefix[r] = pl_to_r.

So, pl_to_i XOR pl_minus_1 = pl_to_r XOR pl_to_i.

Simplify:

pl_to_i XOR pl_minus_1 = pl_to_r XOR pl_to_i

Apply XOR pl_to_i on both sides:

pl_minus_1 = pl_to_r XOR pl_to_i XOR pl_to_i

Since XOR is its own inverse:

pl_minus_1 = pl_to_r

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, pl_to_i XOR pl_minus_1 = pl_to_r XOR pl_to_i

So, pl_to_i XOR pl_minus_1 XOR pl_to_i = pl_to_r

Simplify:

(pl_to_i XOR pl_to_i) XOR pl_minus_1 = pl_to_r

0 XOR pl_minus_1 = pl_to_r

So, pl_minus_1 = pl_to_r

But that's not generally true, unless the total XOR is zero.

Wait, but in general, pl_to_r XOR pl_minus_1 is the total XOR of the subarray.

So, if pl_minus_1 = pl_to_r, then total XOR is zero.

But in the earlier example, for l=1 to r=5, total XOR is 1, which is not zero, but it was still possible to split into parts with equal XOR.

So, this approach isn't leading me anywhere.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if I can find at least two segments within the subarray that have the same XOR, then I can potentially split the subarray into parts with equal XOR.

But this is not sufficient, because those segments might not be consecutive or cover the entire subarray.

I need a way to check if there are multiple segments with the same XOR that cover the entire subarray.

Wait, perhaps I can look for repeated XOR values in the prefix array within the subarray.

Let me think about the prefix XOR array for the subarray from l-1 to r.

Let me denote prefix_sub = [prefix[l-1], prefix[l], ..., prefix[r]]

Now, if I can find indices i1, i2, ..., ik such that prefix_sub[ij] - prefix_sub[ij-1] = y for all j, and the last index is r.

Wait, but XOR isn't subtractive in the same way.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of differences.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the XOR from l-1 to i is equal to the XOR from i to j, and so on.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that in problems involving XOR, using properties of linear algebra over GF(2) can be helpful, but that might be too slow for large n and q.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix XOR array and then, for each query, compute the XOR of the subarray and then check if it can be split into parts with equal XOR.

But I still don't have a clear condition for when such a split is possible.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the frequency of prefix XOR values within the subarray.

Let me consider that if a prefix XOR value repeats, it indicates that the XOR of the elements between those repetitions is zero.

But in this problem, I need to find segments with the same XOR, not necessarily zero.

This is tricky.

Wait, maybe I can fix the XOR value y and then look for pairs of prefix XOR values that differ by y.

But again, iterating over all possible y is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that if the total XOR from l to r is y, and I can split the subarray into k parts each with XOR y, then the total XOR would be y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, for the subarray to be interesting, one of two conditions must hold:

1. The total XOR is 0, and it can be split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

2. The total XOR is y, and it can be split into an odd number of parts with XOR y.

But I need to ensure that such a split exists.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there exists a y such that y divides the subarray into parts with XOR y.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the frequency of prefix XOR values within the subarray.

If I have multiple indices with the same prefix XOR, that means there are subarrays with XOR zero between them.

But in this problem, I need subarrays with the same XOR, not necessarily zero.

This is confusing.

Let me consider that if I have two indices i and j where prefix[i] = prefix[j], then the XOR from i+1 to j is zero.

Similarly, if prefix[i] XOR prefix[j] = y, then the XOR from i+1 to j is y.

So, for a fixed y, I need to find if there are multiple pairs of indices where prefix[i] XOR prefix[j] = y.

But again, iterating over all possible y is not efficient.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can look for y such that y is the total XOR divided by some k.

But XOR doesn't divide in the same way as regular addition.

This isn't working.

Let me consider that if the subarray can be split into k parts with the same XOR, then the total XOR is y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, for a given subarray with total XOR t, if t = 0, then k must be even, and if t != 0, k must be odd.

But I need to have at least two parts, so k >= 2.

Therefore, for t = 0, k can be any even number >= 2, and for t != 0, k can be any odd number >= 3.

But I need to confirm if such a k exists for the given subarray.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there exists at least one split point where the XOR up to that point is equal to the remaining XOR divided by some k.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the frequency of prefix XOR values within the subarray.

Suppose I have a subarray from l to r.

I can compute the prefix XOR array for the entire array.

Then, for the subarray from l to r, the XOR is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

Now, if I can find multiple segments within the subarray that have the same XOR, then maybe I can split them accordingly.

But I need an efficient way to check this for each query.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute all possible XOR values for subarrays and store them in some data structure.

But with n up to 2*10^5, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r, if the total XOR is 0, then it can be split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

Similarly, if the total XOR is y, it can be split into an odd number of parts with XOR y.

But I need to ensure that such a split is possible.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there exists at least one split point where the XOR of the left part equals the XOR of the right part when k=2.

For k=2, it's straightforward: split into two parts with equal XOR.

If I can do that, then the subarray is interesting.

But the problem allows k > 1, so k can be greater than 2.

But if I can split it into two parts with equal XOR, then it's interesting.

Moreover, if I can split it into more than two parts with equal XOR, that's also fine.

So, perhaps I can check if there exists at least one split point where the XOR of the left part equals the XOR of the right part.

If I can find such a split point, then the subarray is interesting.

Wait, but in the first example, for l=1 to r=5, there is a split into three parts with equal XOR.

But there might not be a split into two parts with equal XOR.

Wait, in that case, total XOR is 1, and I need to split into an odd number of parts with XOR y=1.

So, for k=3, it's possible.

But how can I efficiently check for any k >=2 whether such a split exists?

This is tricky.

Let me consider that if I can find at least two segments within the subarray that have the same XOR, then I can potentially use those segments to form parts with equal XOR.

But I need to ensure that the entire subarray can be covered by such parts.

This seems too vague for an efficient implementation.

Let me try to think about the frequency of prefix XOR values within the subarray.

If I have the prefix XOR array for the subarray, and I look at the frequencies of each XOR value, perhaps I can derive something from that.

Wait, maybe I can check if there are multiple indices with the same prefix XOR value within the subarray.

If there are, that means there are subarrays with XOR zero between those indices.

But in this problem, I need subarrays with the same XOR, not necessarily zero.

This is not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if two subarrays have the same XOR, then their symmetric difference has XOR zero.

But I'm not sure how to apply that here.

I need to find a way to check if the subarray can be divided into at least two parts with equal XOR.

Let me consider that if I can find a split point where the XOR of the left part equals the XOR of the right part, then the subarray is interesting.

In other words, for some index i in [l, r), the XOR from l to i equals the XOR from i+1 to r.

If such an i exists, then k=2, and the subarray is interesting.

Moreover, if such split points exist multiple times, I can split into more parts.

So, perhaps checking for at least one such split point is sufficient.

Wait, but in the first example, for l=1 to r=5, there is no split point where XOR from l to i equals XOR from i+1 to r, but it's still interesting because it can be split into three parts with equal XOR.

So, this approach wouldn't catch that case.

Hence, it's not sufficient to check only for k=2.

I need to account for higher k as well.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the total XOR of the subarray, which is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

If the total XOR is 0, then I need to split it into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

If the total XOR is y, then I need to split it into an odd number of parts with each part's XOR equal to y.

So, for total XOR = 0, I need to find if there exists a y such that the subarray can be split into an even number of parts, each with XOR y.

But if total XOR is 0, then y must also be 0, because 0 XOR 0 XOR ... XOR 0 = 0 for even k.

Wait, but the problem allows k >1.

So, for total XOR =0, I can split into an even number of parts, each with XOR 0.

Similarly, for total XOR = y, I can split into an odd number of parts, each with XOR y.

But I need to ensure that such a split is possible.

Wait, perhaps I can check if all parts have XOR equal to y.

But I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider that if I can find at least two segments within the subarray that have XOR y, and the entire subarray's XOR is consistent with y and k being odd or even accordingly, then the subarray is interesting.

But this is still too vague.

I need a concrete plan.

Let me look at the code provided and see if I can understand the approach taken there.

Looking at the code:

- It reads t test cases.

- For each test case, it reads n, q, and the array a.

- It computes the prefix XOR array x, where x[0] = 0, and x[i] = x[i-1] XOR a[i-1] for i from 1 to n+1.

- It uses a dictionary (inds) to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

- For each query (l, r), it checks:

- If x[r] == x[l-1], then the subarray has total XOR 0, and it's possible to split it into an even number of parts with XOR 0, so output "Yes".

- Else, it tries to find if there's at least one index i in [l, r) where x[i] == x[r] and i > l-1, and x[i] != x[l-1].

- If such an i exists, then it's possible to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR, so output "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Wait, that's not exactly what the code does.

Looking closer:

- It uses some functions func_2, func_3, func_4 to binary search for indices in inds[x[r]] and inds[x[l-1]].

- It computes lower as the highest index less than l in inds[x[r]].

- It computes upper as the lowest index greater than or equal to l in inds[x[l-1]].

- If upper > lower, then output "Yes"; else, "No".

Wait, I need to understand this better.

Let me try to decipher this approach.

The prefix XOR array x is built such that x[i] is the XOR of the first i elements.

So, x[0] = 0, x[1] = a[0], x[2] = a[0] XOR a[1], and so on.

The dictionary inds maps each XOR value to the list of indices where that XOR value occurs.

For a query (l, r), the total XOR is x[r] XOR x[l-1].

If x[r] == x[l-1], then the total XOR is 0, and it's possible to split the subarray into an even number of parts with XOR 0.

Hence, "Yes".

If x[r] != x[l-1], then we need to check if there's at least one index i in [l, r) where x[i] == x[r] XOR y, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the code:

- It computes lower as the highest index < l in inds[x[r]].

- It computes upper as the lowest index >= l in inds[x[l-1]].

- If upper > lower, then "Yes"; else, "No".

I need to understand why this works.

Let me consider that inds[x[r]] contains indices where the prefix XOR equals x[r].

Similarly, inds[x[l-1]] contains indices where the prefix XOR equals x[l-1].

If there's an index i in [l, r) where x[i] == x[l-1], then the XOR from l to i is x[i] XOR x[l-1] = x[l-1] XOR x[l-1] = 0.

Similarly, if x[i] == x[r], then XOR from l to i is x[i] XOR x[l-1].

But x[r] XOR x[l-1] is the total XOR.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me consider that if there's an index i in [l, r] where x[i] == x[l-1], then the XOR from l to i is x[i] XOR x[l-1] = 0.

Similarly, if x[i] == x[r], then XOR from i to r is x[r] XOR x[i] = 0.

So, if there's an index i in [l, r) where x[i] == x[l-1], then the subarray from l to i has XOR 0, and from i+1 to r has XOR x[r] XOR x[l-1].

But in this case, for the subarray to be interesting, we need both parts to have the same XOR.

So, if the first part has XOR 0, then the second part must also have XOR 0, meaning x[r] XOR x[l-1] = 0, which is already covered in the first condition.

Similarly, if x[i] == x[r], then the XOR from l to i is x[i] XOR x[l-1] = x[r] XOR x[l-1], which is the total XOR.

So, if the total XOR is y, then the first part has XOR y, and the second part has XOR y.

Hence, if there exists an index i in [l, r) where x[i] XOR x[l-1] = y, which is x[i] = y XOR x[l-1].

But y is x[r] XOR x[l-1], so x[i] = (x[r] XOR x[l-1]) XOR x[l-1] = x[r].

So, x[i] = x[r].

Hence, if there exists an index i in [l, r) where x[i] = x[r], then we can split the subarray into two parts: from l to i and from i+1 to r, each with XOR y.

Therefore, in this case, the subarray is interesting.

Similarly, if there are multiple such i's, we can split into more parts.

Hence, the condition in the code checks if there's at least one such i in [l, r), which is equivalent to checking if there's an index in inds[x[r]] that is >=l and <r.

But in the code, it's using binary search to find the lower and upper bounds.

Wait, specifically:

- lower = highest index < l in inds[x[r]]

- upper = lowest index >= l in inds[x[l-1]]

- If upper > lower, then "Yes"; else, "No"

Wait, this seems a bit different.

Let me think about it.

Suppose we have inds[x[r]] and inds[x[l-1]].

If inds[x[r]] has an index i in [l, r), then we can split the subarray into two parts: [l, i) and [i, r), each with XOR y.

Similarly, if inds[x[l-1]] has an index j >=l, then x[j] = x[l-1], meaning the XOR from l to j is zero.

But I'm not sure how lower and upper are used here.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the specific functions used:

- func_4 seems to find the highest index < l in inds[x[r]]

- func_3 seems to find the lowest index >=l in inds[x[l-1]]

Then, if upper > lower, it means there's at least one index in inds[x[l-1]] that is greater than the highest index in inds[x[r]] that is less than l.

I'm getting lost here.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example:

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

prefix XOR:

x[0] = 0

x[1] = 1

x[2] = 1 XOR 1 = 0

x[3] = 0 XOR 2 = 2

x[4] = 2 XOR 3 = 1

x[5] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

So, inds[0] = [0,2]

inds[1] = [1,4,5]

inds[2] = [3]

Now, for query l=1, r=5: subarray from 1 to 5 is [1,1,2,3,0]

x[r] = x[5] = 1

x[l-1] = x[0] = 0

So, x[r] != x[l-1]

Then, lower = highest index < l in inds[x[r]] = highest index <1 in inds[1] = 1 (since 1 <1 is false, so no such index? Wait, inds[1] = [1,4,5], highest <1 is none, so lower is None or 0.

upper = lowest index >=l in inds[x[l-1]] = lowest index >=1 in inds[0] = 0 or 2? inds[0] = [0,2], lowest >=1 is 2.

If lower is None, then lower=0.

So, upper=2 > lower=0, so "Yes".

Which is correct.

Another query: l=3, r=5: subarray [2,3,0]

x[r]=x[5]=1

x[l-1]=x[2]=0

x[r] != x[l-1]

lower = highest index <3 in inds[1] = 1

upper = lowest index >=3 in inds[0] = 2

upper=2 > lower=1? No, 2 >1 is True, but in reality, it's "No".

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, it should be "No", but according to this, upper=2 > lower=1, which is True, so it would output "Yes", but in the example, it should be "No".

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the code, it's inds[x[r]] and inds[x[l-1]].

Wait, in this query, x[r]=1, x[l-1]=0.

So, inds[x[r]]=inds[1]=[1,4,5]

inds[x[l-1]]=inds[0]=[0,2]

lower = highest index <l in inds[x[r]]=highest index <3 in [1,4,5]=1

upper = lowest index >=l in inds[x[l-1]]=lowest index >=3 in [0,2]=2 (since 2 >=3 is False, so no such index, perhaps it returns None or len(inds[x[l-1]]).

Wait, need to check the functions.

Looking back at the code:

func_4(arr, predicate) finds the highest index < l where predicate is True.

func_3(arr, predicate) finds the lowest index >=l where predicate is True.

So, for inds[x[r]]= [1,4,5], predicate is arg < l=3.

So, func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0.

So, in this case, arg <3 in [1,4,5], so 1 is the highest index <3, so lower=1.

For inds[x[l-1]]= [0,2], func_3(inds[x[l-1]], lambda arg: arg <=r=5).

Wait, no, it's func_3(inds[x[l-1]], lambda arg: arg <=r).

But in the code, it's func_3(inds[x[l-1]], lambda arg: arg <=r).

Wait, no, in the code, it's:

upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]

Wait, I need to check the definition of func_3.

func_3 is func_2, which is binary search for the highest index where predicate is True.

Wait, no:

func_2 is binary search for the highest index where predicate is True.

func_3 is func_2.

func_4 is func_2 and then +1.

Wait, I need to look back.

Looking back at the code:

def func_2(arr, predicate):

(l, r) = (0, len(arr))

while l + 1 < r:

mid = (l + r) // 2

if predicate(arr[mid]):

l = mid

else:

r = mid

if predicate(arr[l]):

return l

return None

def func_3(arr, predicate):

return func_2(arr, predicate)

def func_4(arr, predicate):

result = func_2(arr, predicate)

if result is not None:

return result + 1

return None

So, func_2 is binary search to find the highest index where predicate is True.

func_3 is the same as func_2.

func_4 is func_2 plus 1 if found.

In the code:

lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]

upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]

So, for lower:

func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)

which is the highest index where arg < l, plus 1.

So, in the example, inds[x[r]]= [1,4,5], l=3.

So, arg <3: 1 is less than 3, 4 and 5 are not.

So, highest index where arg <3 is index 0 (value 1).

func_4 returns l+1 =1+1=2.

Then, inds[x[r]][2] would be inds[1][2]=5.

But inds[1] has only indices 1,4,5.

So, inds[x[r]][func_4(...)] would be inds[1][2]=5.

Wait, but l=3, r=5.

So, lower=5.

upper=inds[x[l-1]][func_3(inds[x[l-1]], lambda arg: arg <=r)]

inds[x[l-1]]=inds[0]=[0,2], predicate arg <=5.

So, func_2 finds the highest index where arg <=5.

inds[0][0]=0 <=5, inds[0][1]=2 <=5.

So, highest index where arg <=5 is index 1 (value 2).

So, upper=inds[0][1]=2.

Then, upper=2 > lower=5? No, 2 >5 is False, so "No".

Which matches the expected output.

Another query: l=1, r=5.

lower=inds[1][func_4(inds[1], lambda arg: arg <1) or 0]

inds[1]=[1,4,5], func_4 finds highest index where arg <1, which doesn't exist, so func_4 returns None, so use 0.

So, lower=inds[1][0]=1.

upper=inds[0][func_3(inds[0], lambda arg: arg <=5)]

inds[0]=[0,2], func_3 finds highest index where arg <=5, which is index 1 (value 2).

So, upper=inds[0][1]=2.

Then, upper=2 > lower=1? Yes, so "Yes".

Which is correct.

Another query: l=2, r=4.

x[r]=x[4]=1

x[l-1]=x[1]=1

So, x[r]==x[l-1], so "Yes".

Which is correct.

Another query: l=3, r=4.

x[r]=x[4]=1

x[l-1]=x[2]=0

x[r]!=x[l-1]

lower=inds[1][func_4(inds[1], lambda arg: arg <3) or 0]

inds[1]=[1,4,5], highest index where arg <3 is 1, index=0.

func_4 returns 0+1=1.

So, lower=inds[1][1]=4.

upper=inds[0][func_3(inds[0], lambda arg: arg <=4)]

inds[0]=[0,2], highest index where arg <=4 is index=1 (value=2).

So, upper=inds[0][1]=2.

upper=2 > lower=4? No, so "No".

Which matches the expected output.

So, this seems to work.

Hence, the approach in the code is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: True
