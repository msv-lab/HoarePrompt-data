Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array of numbers, and we need to handle multiple queries where each query gives us a range [l, r] in the array. We need to determine if the subarray from a_l to a_r is "interesting" based on a specific definition.

The definition of an "interesting" array is that we can split it into k > 1 parts, where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. So, for example, if we have an array [1,1,2,3,0], one possible split is [1], [1], [2,3,0], and the XOR of each part is 1, which is equal.

Okay, so my task is to process multiple queries efficiently because the constraints are quite large: n and q can be up to 2*10^5, and t, the number of test cases, is up to 10^4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is limited to 2*10^5.

First, I need to understand what makes a subarray "interesting." Let's think about the properties of XOR. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order of operations doesn't matter, and swapping operands doesn't change the result.

Given a subarray from l to r, I need to split it into k > 1 parts such that the XOR of each part is equal. Let's denote the XOR of the entire subarray as X = a_l XOR a_{l+1} XOR ... XOR a_r. If X is zero, then it's easy: I can split the array into any number of parts, and as long as each part has an even number of elements (if the elements are the same), their XOR would be zero. But actually, if X is zero, I can split it into two parts with equal XOR, each being zero.

Wait, no. If X is zero, I can split it into two parts where the XOR of each part is zero. But I need to ensure that k > 1. So, if X is zero, then it's possible to split it into two parts with equal XOR.

If X is not zero, then I need to see if there's a way to split the array into parts where each part has XOR equal to some value Y, and Y is not necessarily X.

Wait, but if X is the XOR of the entire array, and I split it into k parts with each part having XOR equal to Y, then X should be equal to Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times). If k is even, then X = 0, and if k is odd, then X = Y.

So, wait, let's think about this:

- If k is even, then X = 0.

- If k is odd, then X = Y.

Therefore, for X to be divisible into k > 1 parts with equal XOR:

- If X == 0, then k can be any even number.

- If X != 0, then k must be odd, and Y = X.

But in this problem, we need to check if such a split is possible for some k > 1.

So, for X == 0, it's always possible to split into an even number of parts with XOR 0.

For X != 0, it's possible only if there exists a split where each part has XOR equal to X, and k is odd.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me take an example.

Example 1:

Array: [1,1,2,3,0]

Query: [1,5]

Subarray: [1,1,2,3,0]

X = 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 1 = 0 XOR 2 = 2 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 0 = 1

So, X = 1

If k is odd, then Y = X = 1.

So, I need to split the array into an odd number of parts, each with XOR = 1.

Possible splits:

- [1], [1,2,3,0] -> XORs: 1, 0 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1. So, yes.

- [1,1], [2,3,0] -> XORs: 0, 1. Not equal.

- [1], [1], [2,3,0] -> XORs: 1,1,1. Yes.

So, it's possible.

Another query:

[2,4]

Subarray: [1,2,3]

X = 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0

So, X = 0

Possible to split into even number of parts with XOR 0.

Possible splits:

- [1], [2,3] -> XORs: 1, 1. Not equal.

- [1,2], [3] -> XORs: 3, 3. Yes.

So, it's possible.

Another query:

[3,5]

Subarray: [2,3,0]

X = 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1

Possible splits:

- [2], [3,0] -> XORs: 2, 1. Not equal.

- [2,3], [0] -> XORs: 1, 0. Not equal.

- [2], [3], [0] -> XORs: 2,3,0. Not equal.

So, not possible.

Hence, the output for these queries is YES, YES, NO, etc.

From this, I can see that when X == 0, I need to check if there's a way to split the array into an even number of parts with XOR 0.

When X != 0, I need to check if there's a way to split the array into an odd number of parts with XOR X.

But how to generalize this efficiently?

I need an efficient way to handle multiple queries per test case, and multiple test cases.

Let me think about the properties of XOR prefixes.

Let's define prefix XOR array P, where P[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i]

Then, the XOR of a[l...r] is P[r] XOR P[l-1]

So, for a given [l,r], X = P[r] XOR P[l-1]

Now, for X == 0, I need to check if there exists at least one position p, l <= p < r, such that P[p] XOR P[l-1] == 0, and P[r] XOR P[p] == 0.

Which simplifies to P[p] == P[l-1], and P[p] == P[r]

So, P[l-1] == P[r], and there exists p in [l, r-1] where P[p] == P[l-1]

Similarly, for X != 0, I need to check if there exists p in [l, r-1] where P[p] XOR P[l-1] == Y and P[r] XOR P[p] == Y, with Y == X.

But since X = P[r] XOR P[l-1], it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach.

I recall that for a subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, it's related to the number of times a certain XOR value appears in the prefix array.

Let me look for a standard approach for this problem.

After some research, I find that the problem is related to checking if the subarray has a non-empty proper subarray with XOR equal to the XOR of the whole subarray.

Wait, more carefully:

For a subarray a[l...r], with XOR X = P[r] XOR P[l-1], to be split into k >1 parts with equal XOR, it's equivalent to checking if there exists at least one split point p, l <= p < r, such that the XOR from l to p is equal to X, and the XOR from p+1 to r is also equal to X.

Given that, for X != 0, it's possible only if there exists p in [l, r-1] such that P[p] XOR P[l-1] == X, and P[r] XOR P[p] == X.

Which simplifies to P[p] == P[l-1] XOR X, and P[r] == P[p] XOR X.

But X = P[r] XOR P[l-1].

So, P[p] == P[l-1] XOR (P[r] XOR P[l-1]) == P[r].

And P[r] == P[p] XOR X == P[r] XOR X.

Wait, this seems confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

I found a standard approach for this type of problem.

The idea is to precompute the prefix XOR array P, where P[0] = 0, P[1] = a[1], P[2] = a[1] XOR a[2], and so on.

Then, for a query [l, r], the XOR of the subarray is P[r] XOR P[l-1].

Now, to check if this subarray can be split into k >1 parts with equal XOR, we need to see if there exists at least one split point p, l <= p < r, such that P[p] XOR P[l-1] == P[r] XOR P[p], which simplifies to P[l-1] == P[r], but that's only possible if X == 0.

Wait, no.

Wait, P[p] XOR P[l-1] should equal P[r] XOR P[p], if both parts have equal XOR.

But that implies P[l-1] == P[r], meaning X == 0.

So, if X == 0, then it's possible to split into two parts with equal XOR 0.

But in the general case, for X != 0, it's more complicated.

Actually, for X != 0, it's possible to split into k parts where k is odd, and each part has XOR X.

This seems tricky.

I need a better way.

Looking at the provided code, it seems to handle this by keeping track of indices where certain XOR values occur.

Let me try to understand the given code.

The code defines several functions: func_1 to read input, func_2 to perform a binary search, func_3 and func_4 which seem to be variations of binary search, and func_5 which processes each test case.

In func_5:

- Read n and q.

- Read the array a.

- Compute the prefix XOR array x, where x[0] = 0, x[1] = a[1], x[2] = a[1] XOR a[2], etc.

- Use a dictionary inds to store, for each XOR value, the list of indices where that XOR value occurs.

- For each query [l, r], compute X = x[r] XOR x[l-1].

- If X == 0, then it's "Yes" because we can split into two parts with XOR 0.

- Else, find if there exists an index p in [l, r-1] where x[p] == x[l-1].

- To do this efficiently, it uses binary search on the list of indices where x[p] == x[l-1], to check if there's any p in [l, r-1].

- If such a p exists, then it's "Yes", else "No".

Wait, is this correct?

Let's verify with the example.

Take the first test case:

n=5, q=5

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

Compute x:

x[0] = 0

x[1] = 0 XOR 1 = 1

x[2] = 1 XOR 1 = 0

x[3] = 0 XOR 2 = 2

x[4] = 2 XOR 3 = 1

x[5] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

inds:

0: [0,2]

1: [1,4,5]

2: [3]

Now, for query [1,5]:

l=1, r=5

X = x[5] XOR x[1-1] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

Check if there exists p in [1,4] where x[p] == x[0] == 0.

Looking at inds[0], which is [0,2], p=0 is less than l=1, p=2 is in [1,4].

So, yes, p=2 is in [1,4], so it's "Yes".

Correct, as per the explanation.

Another query [2,4]:

l=2, r=4

X = x[4] XOR x[2-1] = 1 XOR 1 = 0

So, directly "Yes".

Correct.

Another query [3,5]:

l=3, r=5

X = x[5] XOR x[3-1] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

Check if there exists p in [3,4] where x[p] == x[2] == 0.

inds[0] is [0,2], neither is in [3,4], so "No".

Correct.

Hence, the code seems to be working correctly for these examples.

So, the logic is:

- If X == 0, then "Yes".

- Else, check if there's any p in [l, r-1] where x[p] == x[l-1].

- If such a p exists, then "Yes", else "No".

This seems efficient because for each query, after preprocessing the prefix XOR and indexing, we can answer each query quickly using binary search.

The preprocessing involves computing the prefix XOR array in O(n), and building the dictionary of indices for each XOR value, which is O(n).

Then, for each query, we perform a binary search on the list of indices for x[l-1], which is O(log n).

Given that n and q can be up to 2*10^5, this should be efficient enough.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
