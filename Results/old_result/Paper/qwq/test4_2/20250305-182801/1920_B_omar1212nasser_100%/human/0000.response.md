Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are two players, Alice and Bob, who are playing a game with an array of numbers. The game has two steps: first, Alice can remove up to k elements from the array, and then Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final sum would be if both play optimally.

Okay, so first things first, I need to understand the inputs and what exactly is being asked. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with n (the number of elements in the array), k (the maximum number of elements Alice can remove), x (the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and then the array itself.

The constraints are that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t (the number of test cases) can be up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5. So, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient enough to handle this size of input.

Let me think about the problem step by step.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. She wants to maximize the sum of the remaining elements after Bob's move. So, she should remove the elements that are most harmful to the final sum. But, Bob will then try to minimize the sum by multiplying up to x elements by -1.

This seems like a two-player game where each player is trying to optimize their own goal. I need to find out what the optimal strategy is for both players and compute the resulting sum.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the input:

1

1 1 1

1

So, n=1, k=1, x=1, and the array is [1]. Alice can remove up to 1 element, which is the only element, so she removes it. Then, Bob has an empty array to work with, and he can't multiply any elements by -1. So, the sum is 0. That makes sense.

Another example:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Alice can remove up to 1 element, and Bob can multiply up to 1 element by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's move, so she should remove the element that would cause the biggest loss when Bob multiplies some element by -1.

If Alice removes the 1, the array becomes [3,2,4]. Bob can multiply one element by -1 to minimize the sum. He would choose to multiply the largest positive number by -1 to minimize the sum, so he multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in [3,2,-4], sum=1.

If Alice removes the 2, the array becomes [3,1,4]. Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in [3,1,-4], sum=0.

If Alice removes the 3, the array becomes [1,2,4]. Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in [1,2,-4], sum=-1.

If Alice removes the 4, the array becomes [3,1,2]. Bob multiplies 3 by -1, resulting in [-3,1,2], sum=0.

So, among these options, the maximum sum Alice can achieve is 1.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 2. Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Wait, maybe in the second case, if Alice doesn't remove any elements, the array remains [3,1,2,4]. Bob can multiply one element by -1. To minimize the sum, he would multiply the largest positive number by -1, which is 4, so [3,1,2,-4], sum=2. That's better than any of the options where Alice removes an element. So, in this case, it's better for Alice not to remove any elements.

Okay, so Alice has to decide whether to remove elements or not based on what Bob can do afterwards.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's try to think of a general strategy.

First, since Alice wants to maximize the sum and Bob wants to minimize it, I need to find a way to balance their moves.

One approach could be to consider that Bob will always choose to flip the largest possible positive numbers to negative, up to x times, to minimize the sum. So, Alice should try to remove elements that would allow Bob to flip less beneficial elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of sorting the array and considering the effects of removal and flipping.

Let's sort the array in ascending order. That might help in deciding which elements to remove or flip.

Let's consider that after Alice removes k elements, there are n - k elements left. Then, Bob can flip up to x of them to negative.

To maximize the sum, Alice wants to keep the largest possible elements and remove the smallest ones. But, Bob will flip up to x of the remaining elements to negative, preferring to flip the largest ones to minimize the sum.

So, perhaps Alice should remove the smallest k elements, and then Bob flips the largest x of the remaining elements to negative.

Wait, but that might not always be the case. Maybe there are scenarios where Alice should remove some larger elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice removes k elements, and then Bob flips up to x elements. To maximize the sum, Alice should remove the elements that Bob would most likely flip to negative, which are the largest positive elements.

Wait, but Bob can only flip up to x elements. So, if Alice removes the largest elements that Bob would want to flip, that might not be optimal.

This is confusing. Maybe I need to consider different scenarios.

Let me consider that the final sum is the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the elements that Bob flips to negative.

Because flipping an element to negative is equivalent to subtracting twice its value from the total sum.

So, sum_after_flips = sum_of_remaining - 2 * sum_of_flipped_elements.

Alice wants to maximize this sum, and Bob wants to minimize it.

Given that, Alice should choose which elements to remove to maximize the sum after Bob flips up to x of the remaining elements.

To maximize sum_after_flips, Alice should aim to keep as many positive elements as possible and remove negative elements, but in this problem, all elements are positive as per the input constraints (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).

Wait, actually, the problem states that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, so all elements are positive.

So, all elements are positive, and Bob can multiply up to x of them by -1.

So, Bob will always choose to flip the largest positive elements to negative to minimize the sum.

Therefore, to maximize the sum after Bob's move, Alice should try to remove some elements in such a way that the elements Bob flips are as small as possible.

Wait, but if Alice removes some of the smallest elements, then the remaining larger elements can be flipped by Bob, reducing the sum more.

Alternatively, if Alice removes some of the larger elements, then Bob has fewer large elements to flip, which might result in a higher sum.

But it's not straightforward.

Let me think in terms of choosing which elements to keep.

Suppose Alice decides to keep n - k elements. Then, Bob will flip up to x of them to negative.

To maximize the sum after Bob's flip, Alice should choose the n - k largest elements to keep, and Bob will flip the x largest among those to negative.

Wait, but is that always the case?

Let's consider that Alice wants to maximize the sum, which is sum of remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest elements among them.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of selecting which elements to remove and then seeing which x elements Bob will flip.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let S be the set of elements after Alice's removal, i.e., n - k elements.

Sum after Bob's flip: sum(S) - 2 * sum of the x largest elements in S.

Alice wants to maximize this sum.

To maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum_of_x_largest_in_S, Alice needs to choose S such that sum(S) is maximized and sum_of_x_largest_in_S is minimized.

These two objectives are somewhat conflicting because maximizing sum(S) would typically involve keeping larger elements, but minimizing sum_of_x_largest_in_S would involve keeping smaller elements.

So, it's a trade-off.

Perhaps the optimal strategy is to select the n - k elements with the smallest possible largest elements.

Wait, that sounds confusing.

Let me consider sorting the array in ascending order.

Let's sort the array a in ascending order: a[0] ≤ a[1] ≤ ... ≤ a[n-1].

Now, Alice can choose any k elements to remove, leaving n - k elements.

To maximize sum(S) - 2 * sum_of_x_largest_in_S, Alice should choose which elements to remove to make the sum of the remaining elements as large as possible while making the sum of the x largest elements in S as small as possible.

One possible approach is to consider removing the smallest k elements, so that the remaining elements are the largest n - k elements.

Then, Bob will flip the x largest elements among these n - k elements to negative.

So, the sum would be sum of the largest n - k elements minus twice the sum of the x largest elements among them.

But is this the best Alice can do?

Alternatively, maybe Alice should remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them to negative.

But, if she removes the largest elements, the sum of the remaining elements decreases, which is not favorable.

It's a trade-off between keeping the sum high and limiting the impact of Bob's flips.

Let me consider different possibilities.

Suppose Alice removes m elements from the smallest end and k - m elements from the largest end.

Then, the remaining elements would be a[s:m] where s is the starting index and m is the ending index.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of choosing a contiguous segment of n - k elements.

But the array is sorted, so any subset of n - k elements would be a contiguous segment in the sorted array.

Wait, no, subsets don't have to be contiguous, but in a sorted array, the sum is maximized by taking the largest n - k elements.

But in this case, Bob can flip the x largest elements among them to negative.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to take the largest n - k elements and let Bob flip the x largest among them.

Alternatively, maybe Alice can remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them, but that would reduce the sum of the remaining elements.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that Alice can remove up to k elements, and Bob can flip up to x elements.

I need to find the maximum possible sum after these operations.

Let me consider all possible numbers of elements Alice removes, from 0 to k.

For each possible number of removals, say Alice removes m elements, where m ranges from 0 to k.

Then, the remaining array has n - m elements.

Bob can flip up to x elements among these n - m elements.

To minimize the sum, Bob will flip the x largest elements among the remaining ones to negative.

So, the sum after Bob's flip is sum of the remaining n - m elements minus twice the sum of the x largest among them.

Alice needs to choose m (between 0 and k) to maximize this sum.

So, for each m from 0 to k, Alice can calculate the sum of the remaining n - m elements minus twice the sum of the x largest among them, and choose the m that maximizes this value.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to choose m (number of elements to remove) between 0 and k, such that the sum of the remaining n - m elements minus twice the sum of the x largest among them is maximized.

To implement this efficiently, I need an efficient way to compute this for each m.

Let's sort the array in ascending order.

Then, for a given m, the remaining elements are a[n - m - 1] to a[n - 1].

The x largest among them are a[n - m - 1 + x] to a[n - 1].

Wait, if the array is sorted in ascending order, a[n - 1] is the largest, a[n - m - 1] is the m+1 largest.

So, for m from 0 to k:

- Remaining elements are a[n - m - 1] to a[n - 1].

- The x largest among them are a[n - x - 1] to a[n - 1].

Wait, no.

If the array is sorted in ascending order, a[0] to a[n-1], with a[n-1] being the largest.

If Alice removes m elements, she can remove the smallest m elements, i.e., a[0] to a[m-1], leaving a[m] to a[n-1].

Then, Bob will flip the x largest among these remaining elements, which are a[n - 1] to a[n - x].

So, the sum after flipping is sum(a[m] to a[n - 1]) - 2 * sum(a[n - x] to a[n - 1]).

Wait, no.

Wait, if Alice removes m elements from the smallest end, the remaining elements are a[m] to a[n - 1].

Bob will flip the x largest among these, which are a[n - 1] to a[n - x].

So, the sum after flipping is sum(a[m] to a[n - x - 1]) + sum(-a[n - x] to -a[n - 1]).

Which is equal to sum(a[m] to a[n - x - 1]) - sum(a[n - x] to a[n - 1]).

Which is equal to sum(a[m] to a[n - 1]) - 2 * sum(a[n - x] to a[n - 1]).

Yes, that matches what I said earlier.

So, for each m from 0 to k, the sum after Bob's flip is sum(a[m] to a[n - 1]) - 2 * sum(a[n - x] to a[n - 1]).

Wait, but this seems independent of m and x, which can't be right.

Wait, no.

Wait, if m varies, then the remaining elements are a[m] to a[n - 1], and the x largest are a[n - 1] to a[n - x].

So, sum(a[m] to a[n - x - 1]) - sum(a[n - x] to a[n - 1]).

Wait, but this depends on m and x.

Wait, no, actually, if m is less than or equal to n - x, then the x largest are a[n - 1] to a[n - x], but if m > n - x, then the x largest are a[n - m - 1] to a[n - 1].

Wait, I think I made a mistake.

If m <= n - x, then the x largest elements among the remaining a[m] to a[n - 1] are a[n - 1] to a[n - x].

But if m > n - x, i.e., m >= n - x + 1, then the remaining elements are a[m] to a[n - 1], and since m > n - x, the number of remaining elements is less than x.

So, Bob can flip all the remaining elements to negative.

Wait, no.

Wait, if m > n - x, then the number of remaining elements is n - m < x.

So, Bob can flip all the remaining elements to negative.

Wait, no, Bob can flip up to x elements, but if there are only n - m elements left, he can flip all of them.

So, in this case, sum after flipping is -sum(a[m] to a[n - 1]).

Wait, yes.

So, to summarize:

For m from 0 to k:

- If m <= n - x, then sum = sum(a[m] to a[n - x - 1]) - sum(a[n - x] to a[n - 1])

- Else, sum = -sum(a[m] to a[n - 1])

And Alice chooses the m that maximizes this sum.

Wait, let's verify this.

If m <= n - x, then Bob flips the x largest elements, which are a[n - 1] to a[n - x], to negative.

So, the sum becomes sum(a[m] to a[n - x - 1]) - sum(a[n - x] to a[n - 1]).

If m > n - x, then the number of remaining elements is n - m < x.

So, Bob can flip all remaining elements to negative.

Thus, sum becomes -sum(a[m] to a[n - 1]).

Yes, that seems correct.

So, for each m from 0 to k:

- If m <= n - x, sum = sum(a[m] to a[n - x - 1]) - sum(a[n - x] to a[n - 1])

- Else, sum = -sum(a[m] to a[n - 1])

And Alice chooses the m that maximizes this sum.

Now, I need to compute this efficiently.

First, sort the array in ascending order.

Compute prefix sums for the array.

Let’s define prefix[m] = sum(a[0] to a[m - 1])

Then, sum(a[m] to a[p]) = prefix[p + 1] - prefix[m]

So, sum(a[m] to a[n - x - 1]) = prefix[n - x] - prefix[m]

sum(a[n - x] to a[n - 1]) = prefix[n] - prefix[n - x]

So, sum when m <= n - x is (prefix[n - x] - prefix[m]) - (prefix[n] - prefix[n - x]) = 2 * prefix[n - x] - prefix[m] - prefix[n]

And when m > n - x, sum = - (prefix[n] - prefix[m])

So, for each m from 0 to k, compute:

if m <= n - x:

sum = 2 * prefix[n - x] - prefix[m] - prefix[n]

else:

sum = - (prefix[n] - prefix[m])

Then, choose the maximum sum over m from 0 to k.

This seems efficient, as we can precompute the prefix sums.

Now, implement this logic.

Let me try to implement this in code.

First, read t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

Read n, k, x.

Read the array a of n elements.

Sort a in ascending order.

Compute prefix sums: prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1], ..., prefix[n] = sum of all elements.

Then, for m from 0 to k:

if m <= n - x:

sum = 2 * prefix[n - x] - prefix[m] - prefix[n]

else:

sum = - (prefix[n] - prefix[m])

Keep track of the maximum sum.

Finally, print the maximum sum.

Let me test this logic with the first sample input.

Sample Input:

8

1 1 1

1

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

...

Sample Output:

0

2

...

First test case: n=1, k=1, x=1, a=[1]

Sort a: [1]

prefix = [0, 1]

For m=0:

m <= 1 - 1: sum = 2*prefix[0] - prefix[0] - prefix[1] = 0 - 0 - 1 = -1

m=1:

sum = - (prefix[1] - prefix[1]) = -0 = 0

Maximum sum is 0, which matches the sample output.

Second test case: n=4, k=1, x=1, a=[3,1,2,4]

Sort a: [1,2,3,4]

prefix = [0,1,3,6,10]

For m=0:

m <= 4-1=3: sum=2*prefix[3]-prefix[0]-prefix[4]=2*6-0-10=2

m=1:

m <= 3: sum=2*prefix[3]-prefix[1]-prefix[4]=12-1-10=1

m=2:

m <= 3: sum=12-3-10=-1

m=3:

m <= 3: sum=12-6-10=-4

m=4:

m > 3: sum= - (10 - 10)=0

Maximum sum is 2, which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Let me check another sample input.

Input:

2 1 2

1 3

n=2, k=1, x=2, a=[1,3]

Sort a: [1,3]

prefix = [0,1,4]

For m=0:

m <= 2-2=0: sum=2*prefix[0]-prefix[0]-prefix[2]=0-0-4=-4

m=1:

m > 0: sum= - (4 - 1)= -3

m=2:

m > 0: sum= - (4 - 4)=0

Maximum sum is 0, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

2 1 2

1 3

Output: 0

Seems correct.

Another test case:

2 2 1

1 3

Output: -1

Wait, according to my logic:

n=2, k=2, x=1, a=[1,3]

prefix=[0,1,4]

For m=0:

m <= 2-1=1: sum=2*prefix[1]-prefix[0]-prefix[2]=2*1-0-4=-2

m=1:

m <=1: sum=2*prefix[1]-prefix[1]-prefix[2]=2-1-4=-3

m=2:

m >1: sum= - (4-4)=0

Maximum sum is 0, but the sample output is -1.

Wait, there must be a mistake in my logic.

Wait, in this case, the sample output is -1, but according to my calculation, it should be 0.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output.

Wait, let's check the sample input again.

The last two test cases:

2 2 1

4 3

Output: 0

And

2 1 2

1 3

Output: -1

Wait, in my previous calculation for 2 2 1, I got 0, but the sample output is 0, which matches.

Wait, no, for 2 1 2, I got 0, but sample output is -1.

Wait, perhaps I misread the input.

Wait, looking back:

Input:

8

1 1 1

1

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

6 6 3

1 4 3 2 5 6

6 6 1

2 2 1

4 3

2 1 2

1 3

Output:

0

-5

-9

0

-1

So, for the last test case: n=2, k=1, x=2, a=[1,3]

According to the sample output, it's -1.

But according to my logic, it should be 0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, let's re-examine the problem.

Alice can remove up to k elements, and Bob can flip up to x elements.

In this case, n=2, k=1, x=2.

Alice can remove up to 1 element.

If she removes 1 element:

- If she removes 1, the remaining is [3]. Bob can flip up to 2 elements, but there's only 1, so he flips it to -3. Sum is -3.

- If she removes 3, the remaining is [1]. Bob can flip up to 2 elements, but only 1, so he flips it to -1. Sum is -1.

- If she removes 0 elements, the array is [1,3]. Bob can flip up to 2 elements, so he flips both to -1 and -3. Sum is -4.

So, the maximum sum Alice can achieve is -1, which matches the sample output.

But according to my earlier logic, I considered m from 0 to k, and chose the maximum of sum(a[m] to a[n - x - 1]) - sum(a[n - x] to a[n - 1]) when m <= n - x, else -sum(a[m] to a[n - 1]).

For n=2, k=1, x=2:

sorted a=[1,3]

prefix=[0,1,4]

For m=0:

m <= 2-2=0: sum=2*prefix[0]-prefix[0]-prefix[2]=0-0-4=-4

m=1:

m <=0: no, so sum= - (4 -1)= -3

m=2:

m >0: sum= - (4 -4)=0

Maximum is 0, but sample output is -1.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Ah, I see the mistake.

In my earlier logic, for m=1, since m > n - x (1 > 0), sum = - (prefix[2] - prefix[1]) = - (4 -1) = -3

But according to the sample, the correct sum should be -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, n - x = 2 - 2 = 0

So, m <= 0: for m=0, sum=2*prefix[0]-prefix[0]-prefix[2]=-4

m=1: m >0, sum= - (4 -1)= -3

m=2: m >0, sum= - (4 -4)=0

But according to the actual possible sums:

- m=0: sum=-4

- m=1: sum=-3

- m=2: sum=0

But in the sample, the output is -1, which is not matching with any of these.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can flip up to x elements, not necessarily exactly x elements.

So, in the case where m=1, and the remaining array is [3], Bob can flip up to 2 elements, but there's only 1, so he flips it to -3, sum=-3.

But the sample output is -1, which suggests that Alice chooses to remove one element, say 3, leaving [1], and Bob flips it to -1, sum=-1, which is better than -3.

So, the maximum among -4, -3, and -1 is -1.

But in my earlier logic, for m=2, sum=0, which is better than -1, but according to the sample, it's -1.

Wait, no, m=2 means removing 2 elements, leaving an empty array, sum=0.

But according to the sample, it's -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if m = n, sum=0, but it's not necessarily the best choice.

Wait, in the sample explanation, for this test case, it's optimal for Alice to remove one element, either 1 or 3.

If she removes 1, remaining is [3], Bob flips it to -3, sum=-3.

If she removes 3, remaining is [1], Bob flips it to -1, sum=-1.

If she removes both, sum=0.

So, the maximum among -3, -1, and 0 is 0, but the sample output is -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my understanding.

Wait, maybe the problem specifies that Bob will flip exactly x elements, not up to x.

But the problem says "multiply at most x elements of the array by -1".

So, he can flip up to x elements.

In the sample explanation, it seems that Bob chooses to flip only one element when there's only one element left.

Wait, in the last test case, n=2, k=1, x=2, a=[1,3]

Alice can remove up to 1 element.

If she removes 1, remaining [3], Bob can flip up to 2 elements, but there's only 1, so he flips it to -3, sum=-3.

If she removes 3, remaining [1], Bob can flip up to 2 elements, but only 1, flips it to -1, sum=-1.

If she removes both, sum=0.

So, the maximum among -3, -1, and 0 is 0, but the sample output is -1.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, looking back at the sample output, it's -1 for this test case.

But according to the above, the maximum should be 0.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when m >= n - x, Bob can flip all remaining elements, but he can also choose to flip fewer.

Wait, in this case, n=2, x=2, m=1, remaining 1 element.

Bob can flip up to 2 elements, but there's only 1, so he flips it to -1.

Sum=-1.

If m=2, removing both, sum=0.

So, the maximum is max(-1, 0).

But according to the sample output, it's -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob will choose to flip fewer elements if it benefits him.

But the problem says "multiply at most x elements by -1", so Bob can choose to flip fewer elements.

In this case, if Alice removes both elements, sum=0.

If she removes one element, say 1, remaining [3], Bob flips it to -3, sum=-3.

If she removes 3, remaining [1], Bob flips it to -1, sum=-1.

So, the maximum among -3, -1, and 0 is -1.

Hence, the sample output is -1.

But in my earlier logic, for m=2, sum=0, which is better than -1.

Wait, perhaps my logic is incomplete.

In my earlier approach, for m >= n - x, sum = -sum(a[m:]).

But in reality, Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

So, in this case, when m=2, sum=0, which is better than -1.

But according to the sample, it's -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the logic for m >= n - x.

Wait, perhaps when m >= n - x, Bob can choose to flip any number of elements up to x, including zero.

So, in this case, when m=2, there are no elements left, sum=0.

When m=1, one element left, Bob can choose to flip it or not.

To minimize the sum, he will flip it only if it's positive.

So, in this case, a=[1,3], sorted [1,3].

For m=1, remaining [3], Bob can choose to flip it to -3 or keep it as 3.

To minimize the sum, he will flip it to -3.

For m=2, no elements left, sum=0.

So, the sums are:

m=0: sum=2*prefix[0]-prefix[0]-prefix[2]=-4

m=1: sum= - (prefix[2] - prefix[1])=-3

m=2: sum= - (prefix[2] - prefix[2])=0

But according to the actual possible sums:

- m=0: sum=-4

- m=1: sum=-3

- m=2: sum=0

But in reality, for m=1, sum=-3, for m=2, sum=0.

But according to the sample, the correct answer is -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

In the case where m=1, Bob can flip up to x=2 elements, but there's only 1, so he flips it to -3.

For m=2, no elements left, sum=0.

But according to the sample, it's -1, which suggests that Alice chooses m=1, removing 3, leaving [1], Bob flips it to -1.

So, sum=-1.

But according to my earlier logic, sum for m=1 is -3, which is worse than -1.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion.

Wait, in the sample explanation, for this test case, it's optimal for Alice to remove 3, leaving [1], and Bob flips it to -1, sum=-1, which is better than removing 1, leaving [3], which Bob flips to -3, sum=-3, or removing both, sum=0.

So, the maximum among -3, -1, and 0 is -1.

But according to my earlier logic, for m=1, sum=-3, and for m=2, sum=0.

Wait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula for m <= n -x.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when m >= n -x, Bob can choose to flip all remaining elements, but also he can choose to flip fewer.

In the earlier formula, for m >= n -x, sum = -sum(a[m:])

But in reality, Bob can choose to flip fewer elements.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

For m from 0 to k:

if m >= n -x, sum = sum(a[m:]) - 2 * sum(a[m: m + x])

else, sum = sum(a[m:]) - 2 * sum(a[n -x :])

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements, but he can choose to flip fewer.

But the problem says "multiply at most x elements by -1", so he can choose to flip any number from 0 to x.

In the earlier approach, I assumed that Bob will always flip the x largest elements, but in reality, he can choose to flip fewer.

So, in the case where m >= n -x, the remaining elements are fewer than x, so Bob can flip all of them, but in some cases, it might be better for him to flip fewer.

Wait, in the last test case, n=2, k=1, x=2, a=[1,3]

For m=1, remaining [3], Bob can flip it to -3 or keep it as 3.

To minimize the sum, he will flip it to -3.

For m=2, no elements left, sum=0.

So, the sums are -3 and 0.

Alice chooses the maximum, which is 0.

But the sample output is -1, which suggests that there's another possibility.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when m >= n -x, Bob can choose to flip fewer elements.

In this case, for m=1, remaining [3], Bob can flip up to x=2 elements, but there's only 1, so he flips it to -3.

For m=2, no elements left, sum=0.

So, Alice chooses the maximum among -3 and 0, which is 0.

But the sample output is -1.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"multiply at most x elements of the array by -1"

So, Bob can choose to flip any number from 0 to x elements.

In the case where m=1, remaining [1], Bob can choose to flip it to -1 or keep it as 1.

To minimize the sum, he will flip it to -1.

Similarly, for m=2, no elements left, sum=0.

So, sums are -1 and 0.

Alice chooses the maximum, which is 0.

But the sample output is -1.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Wait, the last two test cases are:

2 2 1

4 3

Output: 0

And

2 1 2

1 3

Output: -1

Wait, perhaps I confused the inputs.

Wait, for n=2, k=2, x=1, a=[4,3], output=0

For n=2, k=1, x=2, a=[1,3], output=-1

So, in the first case, n=2, k=2, x=1, a=[4,3]

Sorted a=[3,4]

For m=0:

m <=2-1=1: sum=2*prefix[1]-prefix[0]-prefix[2]=2*3-0-7=-1

m=1:

m <=1: sum=2*prefix[1]-prefix[1]-prefix[2]=6-3-7=-4

m=2:

m >1: sum= - (7-7)=0

Maximum is 0, which matches the sample output.

In the second case, n=2, k=1, x=2, a=[1,3]

Sorted a=[1,3]

For m=0:

m <=2-2=0: sum=2*prefix[0]-prefix[0]-prefix[2]=0-0-4=-4

m=1:

m <=0: no, so sum= - (4 -1)= -3

m=2:

m >0: sum= - (4 -4)=0

Maximum is 0, but sample output is -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to flip fewer elements.

In the case where m=1, remaining [3], Bob can choose to flip 0 or 1 elements.

If he flips 0, sum=3

If he flips 1, sum=-3

To minimize the sum, he chooses to flip to -3.

Similarly, for m=2, no elements, sum=0.

So, sums are -3 and 0.

Alice chooses the maximum, which is 0.

But the sample output is -1.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample explanation.

Wait, perhaps I misread the input.

Wait, checking the sample input again:

8

1 1 1

1

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

6 6 3

1 4 3 2 5 6

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

10 6 4

1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200

2 2 1

4 3

2 1 2

1 3

Output:

0

0

-5

-9

0

-1

So, the last two test cases are:

2 2 1

4 3

Output:0

And

2 1 2

1 3

Output:-1

So, for n=2, k=2, x=1, a=[4,3], output=0

For n=2, k=1, x=2, a=[1,3], output=-1

In the first one, as I calculated, maximum is 0, which matches.

In the second one, according to my earlier logic, maximum is 0, but sample output is -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when m >= n -x, Bob can choose to flip fewer elements.

In this case, n=2, x=2, m=1, n -x=0.

So, m >=0, which is always true.

Wait, no, in my earlier condition, for m >= n -x, use sum = -sum(a[m:])

But in reality, Bob can choose to flip fewer elements.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

For m from 0 to k:

if m >= n -x, sum = sum(a[m:]) - 2 * sum(a[m: m + x])

else, sum = sum(a[m:]) - 2 * sum(a[n -x :])

But need to handle the case when m + x > n.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements, but he can choose to flip fewer if it benefits him.

In the case where m >= n -x, the number of remaining elements is less than x, so Bob can flip all of them.

In the case where m < n -x, Bob can flip up to x elements, but there are more than x elements to choose from.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula to:

For m from 0 to k:

if m >= n -x, sum = -sum(a[m:])

else, sum = sum(a[m:]) - 2 * sum of the x largest elements in a[m:])

So, in the earlier case, for m=1, n=2, x=2, m >= 0, sum = -sum(a[1:])=-3

But in reality, Bob can choose to flip fewer elements.

Wait, but in this case, x=2, and only one element remains, so he has to flip that one.

So, sum=-3.

But according to the sample, the correct sum is -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when m >= n -x, Bob can choose to flip fewer elements.

Wait, n -x =0, m=1 >=0, but in reality, Bob can flip up to x=2 elements, but only one element remains, so he flips it to -3.

But according to the sample, the correct sum is -1, which suggests that Alice removes 3, leaving [1], and Bob flips it to -1.

So, sum=-1.

But according to my formula, sum = -sum(a[1:])=-3.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps when m >= n -x, sum = sum(a[m:]) - 2 * sum of the x-m elements.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Perhaps a better approach is to consider that Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements.

So, for m from 0 to k:

sum = sum(a[m:]) - 2 * sum of the x largest elements in a[m:])

Where the sum of the x largest elements is sum(a[-x:]) if m <= n -x, else sum(a[m:])

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, in the case where m <= n -x, the x largest elements are a[n -x:].

Else, the x largest elements are a[m: m + x].

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps it's better to precompute the sum of the x largest elements in the remaining array.

So, for m from 0 to k:

remaining = a[m:]

sum_remaining = sum(remaining)

sum_x_largest = sum of the x largest elements in remaining

sum_after_flipping = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_x_largest

Then, choose the maximum over m of sum_after_flipping.

To compute sum_x_largest efficiently, we can sort the remaining
