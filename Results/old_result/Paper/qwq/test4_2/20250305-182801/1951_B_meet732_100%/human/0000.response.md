Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position, and they're going to have a tournament. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between the cows in positions 1 and 2, and then each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line. The cow with the higher rating always wins.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets in the tournament. I have the option to swap my cow with another cow's position exactly once or choose not to swap at all. My goal is to find out the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve with this option.

First, I need to understand how the tournament works. Let's consider the matches step by step.

1. **Initial Match:** Position 1 vs. Position 2.

- The cow with the higher rating wins.

2. **Subsequent Matches:** The winner of the previous match faces the next cow in line.

- This continues until all cows have been included.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, the tournament essentially simulates a process where the highest-rated cow among the first few cows will eventually win all their matches until they face a higher-rated cow.

But in this problem, I can swap my cow with another one position, aiming to maximize my cow's wins.

Let me think about what affects the number of wins for my cow.

- The number of wins depends on how many cows my cow can defeat before losing to a higher-rated cow.

- If my cow has a higher rating than the cows it faces, it wins; otherwise, it loses.

- By swapping positions, I can change the sequence in which my cow faces other cows, potentially increasing the number of wins.

I need to find the optimal position to place my cow to maximize its wins.

Let's consider the original positions and the impact of swapping.

Suppose I don't swap my cow; it stays in position k. In the tournament, it will participate in matches based on the sequence defined.

But since the tournament structure is such that the winner continues to the next match, my cow's path to subsequent matches depends on who wins the previous matches.

This seems a bit complicated to track directly. Maybe there's a smarter way to model this.

Let's think about the tournament as a sequence of matches where the winner of each match proceeds to the next one.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, the cow with the highest rating among the first few cows will win all matches until it faces a higher-rated cow.

Wait, but in this problem, the matches are structured in a specific way: the first match is between position 1 and 2, then the winner faces position 3, and so on.

So, the tournament bracket is predetermined based on the positions.

Given this, I need to see how my cow can be positioned to face the weakest possible opponents to maximize its wins.

If I swap my cow with another position, I change its place in the sequence, which can alter the path it takes through the tournament.

I need to find the best position for my cow to maximize its wins.

Let me try to simulate a small example to understand better.

**Example 1:**

n = 6, k = 1

a = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

Original positions:

Pos 1: 12

Pos 2: 10

Pos 3: 14

Pos 4: 11

Pos 5: 8

Pos 6: 3

Matches:

1. Pos1 (12) vs Pos2 (10): 12 wins

2. Winner (12) vs Pos3 (14): 14 wins

3. Winner (14) vs Pos4 (11): 14 wins

4. Winner (14) vs Pos5 (8): 14 wins

5. Winner (14) vs Pos6 (3): 14 wins

My cow (Pos1) wins only once.

Is there a better position for my cow?

Let's try swapping Pos1 and Pos3:

Pos1: 14

Pos2: 10

Pos3: 12

Pos4: 11

Pos5: 8

Pos6: 3

Matches:

1. Pos1 (14) vs Pos2 (10): 14 wins

2. Winner (14) vs Pos3 (12): 14 wins

3. Winner (14) vs Pos4 (11): 14 wins

4. Winner (14) vs Pos5 (8): 14 wins

5. Winner (14) vs Pos6 (3): 14 wins

My cow (originally Pos1, now Pos3 with 12) doesn't participate in any matches because the highest-rated cow (14) wins all matches.

Wait, that's not helpful.

Another option: swap Pos1 and Pos4.

Pos1: 11

Pos2: 10

Pos3: 14

Pos4: 12

Pos5: 8

Pos6: 3

Matches:

1. Pos1 (11) vs Pos2 (10): 11 wins

2. Winner (11) vs Pos3 (14): 14 wins

3. Winner (14) vs Pos4 (12): 14 wins

4. Winner (14) vs Pos5 (8): 14 wins

5. Winner (14) vs Pos6 (3): 14 wins

My cow (originally Pos1, now Pos4 with 12) wins once.

Seems similar to the original.

Another swap: Pos1 and Pos5.

Pos1: 8

Pos2: 10

Pos3: 14

Pos4: 11

Pos5: 12

Pos6: 3

Matches:

1. Pos1 (8) vs Pos2 (10): 10 wins

2. Winner (10) vs Pos3 (14): 14 wins

3. Winner (14) vs Pos4 (11): 14 wins

4. Winner (14) vs Pos5 (12): 14 wins

5. Winner (14) vs Pos6 (3): 14 wins

My cow (originally Pos1, now Pos5 with 12) wins once.

Not better.

Another swap: Pos1 and Pos6.

Pos1: 3

Pos2: 10

Pos3: 14

Pos4: 11

Pos5: 8

Pos6: 12

Matches:

1. Pos1 (3) vs Pos2 (10): 10 wins

2. Winner (10) vs Pos3 (14): 14 wins

3. Winner (14) vs Pos4 (11): 14 wins

4. Winner (14) vs Pos5 (8): 14 wins

5. Winner (14) vs Pos6 (12): 14 wins

My cow (originally Pos1, now Pos6 with 12) doesn't participate.

Wait, in this case, my cow doesn't get to play at all because the highest-rated cow wins before reaching Pos6.

So, it's not beneficial.

From these trials, it seems that in the first example, the best is to do nothing and have my cow win once.

Now, let's look at the second example:

n = 6, k = 5

a = [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]

Original positions:

Pos1: 7

Pos2: 2

Pos3: 727

Pos4: 10

Pos5: 12

Pos6: 13

Matches:

1. Pos1 (7) vs Pos2 (2): 7 wins

2. Winner (7) vs Pos3 (727): 727 wins

3. Winner (727) vs Pos4 (10): 727 wins

4. Winner (727) vs Pos5 (12): 727 wins

5. Winner (727) vs Pos6 (13): 727 wins

My cow (Pos5, 12) wins zero matches.

Is there a better position for my cow?

Let's try swapping Pos5 and Pos3.

Pos1: 7

Pos2: 2

Pos3: 12

Pos4: 10

Pos5: 727

Pos6: 13

Matches:

1. Pos1 (7) vs Pos2 (2): 7 wins

2. Winner (7) vs Pos3 (12): 12 wins

3. Winner (12) vs Pos4 (10): 12 wins

4. Winner (12) vs Pos5 (727): 727 wins

5. Winner (727) vs Pos6 (13): 727 wins

My cow (originally Pos5, now Pos3 with 12) wins twice.

Seems better.

Another swap: Pos5 and Pos6.

Pos1: 7

Pos2: 2

Pos3: 727

Pos4: 10

Pos5: 13

Pos6: 12

Matches:

1. Pos1 (7) vs Pos2 (2): 7 wins

2. Winner (7) vs Pos3 (727): 727 wins

3. Winner (727) vs Pos4 (10): 727 wins

4. Winner (727) vs Pos5 (13): 727 wins

5. Winner (727) vs Pos6 (12): 727 wins

My cow (originally Pos5, now Pos6 with 12) doesn't participate.

Not better.

Another swap: Pos5 and Pos4.

Pos1: 7

Pos2: 2

Pos3: 727

Pos4: 12

Pos5: 10

Pos6: 13

Matches:

1. Pos1 (7) vs Pos2 (2): 7 wins

2. Winner (7) vs Pos3 (727): 727 wins

3. Winner (727) vs Pos4 (12): 727 wins

4. Winner (727) vs Pos5 (10): 727 wins

5. Winner (727) vs Pos6 (13): 727 wins

My cow (originally Pos5, now Pos4 with 12) wins once.

Not as good as swapping to Pos3.

So, in this case, swapping to Pos3 gives my cow 2 wins, which is better than the original 0 wins.

From these examples, it seems that to maximize the number of wins for my cow, I need to place it in a position where it can participate in as many matches as possible before facing a cow with a higher rating.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, I should place my cow in a position where it can win against the preceding cows and lose as late as possible to a higher-rated cow.

Let me try to generalize this.

First, if I don't swap, my cow stays in position k and will participate in matches based on the tournament sequence.

I need to find out how many wins my cow can get in the original sequence and compare it with the wins it can get if swapped to another position.

But checking all possible swap positions is inefficient, especially since n can be up to 10^5 per test case, and t can be up to 10^4.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the tournament process.

The tournament starts with match 1 between position 1 and 2.

The winner of match 1 then plays against position 3, and so on, until all cows have been included.

This is essentially a process where the winner accumulates wins by defeating the next cow in line.

Given that, my cow can only participate in matches if it is the winner of the previous match.

So, to maximize my cow's wins, I need to position it in such a way that it can participate in as many matches as possible, defeating the cows before it, and losing as late as possible.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, I need to place my cow in a position where the cows before it have lower ratings, allowing my cow to win those matches, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but the tournament structure is such that the winner continues to the next match, so the sequence matters.

Let me try to model this.

Suppose I place my cow at position p.

Then, in the tournament, my cow will participate in matches starting from match p-1 (since the first match is between 1 and 2, second between winner and 3, and so on).

I need to see how many consecutive wins my cow can get from position p, facing the cows in positions p-1, p-2, ..., until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, but the tournament structure is not exactly like that.

Actually, in the tournament, the matches are sequenced as follows:

- Match 1: Pos1 vs Pos2

- Match 2: Winner of Match1 vs Pos3

- Match 3: Winner of Match2 vs Pos4

- ...

- Match n-1: Winner of Match n-2 vs Pos n

So, if I place my cow at position p, it will face the winner of the previous match, which is the winner of match p-2 (if p >= 3).

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Maybe I should think in terms of how many cows my cow can defeat before being defeated.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, my cow can defeat all cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are positioned before it in the tournament sequence.

But in the tournament structure, the sequence is fixed: Pos1 vs Pos2, then winner vs Pos3, and so on.

So, my cow can only participate in matches if it is the winner of the previous match.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the position where my cow can be reached in the tournament sequence and has the maximum possible wins.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Find the position to place my cow such that there are as many cows with lower ratings before it as possible, and the first cow with a higher rating is as far as possible.

But I need to consider the tournament sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the tournament as a process where the winner accumulates wins by defeating lower-rated cows until facing a higher-rated cow.

So, if I place my cow in a position where the preceding cows have lower ratings, my cow can win more matches.

But I need to make sure that my cow is reached in the tournament sequence.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the path to my cow's position.

Let me consider that the tournament is like a linked list, where each match is a step from one cow to the next.

The first match is between Pos1 and Pos2.

The winner of the first match then faces Pos3, and so on.

So, the tournament progresses from the first positions to the last, with the winner accumulating wins.

If I place my cow in position p, I need to see how many wins it can achieve before being defeated.

But to be reached at position p, the winner of match p-2 (if p >=3) needs to be the winner up to that point.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to find a different angle.

Suppose I fix my cow's position to p.

Then, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are positioned before it in the tournament sequence, starting from position p.

Wait, but the tournament sequence is fixed: Pos1 vs Pos2, then winner vs Pos3, and so on.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to p - 1 minus the number of cows with higher ratings before it in positions 1 to p-1.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that my cow is placed at position p.

Then, to reach my cow, the winner of match p-2 (if p >=3) needs to be the winner up to that point.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I should consider the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it in the sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of cows with lower ratings that are to the left of my cow's position, but considering the tournament sequence.

This is still confusing.

Let me try to look for a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this efficiently.

Looking back at the examples:

In the first example:

n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

Original position: k=1, so my cow is Pos1 with rating 12.

It wins against Pos2 (10), then loses to Pos3 (14).

So, wins=1.

In the second example:

n=6, k=5, a=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

Original position: k=5, Pos5 with rating 12.

In original sequence, it doesn't win any matches.

But if swapped to Pos3, it wins two matches.

So, wins=2.

In the third example:

n=2, k=2, a=[1000000000,1]

Original position: k=2, Pos2 with rating 1.

It loses to Pos1 (1000000000).

Wins=0.

Cannot improve by swapping since there's only one other cow.

Now, I need to find a general way to compute the maximum number of wins for my cow, considering the option to swap once or not at all.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it in the tournament sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Given the tournament structure, the sequence is fixed: Pos1 vs Pos2, then winner vs Pos3, and so on.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to p - 1 minus the number of cows with higher ratings before it in positions 1 to p-1.

Wait, perhaps more precisely:

- If I place my cow at position p, it will face the winner of the previous match (match p-1).

- To reach position p, the winner up to position p-1 must have a lower rating than my cow to be defeated by it.

This seems too tangled.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix my cow's position to p.

Then, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows before it (positions 1 to p-1) that have lower ratings than my cow.

But in reality, it's not that simple because the winner accumulates wins by defeating the next cow in line.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider how many cows before it can be defeated in sequence.

But I'm still not getting it.

Let me try to look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that my cow needs to be placed in a position where the preceding cows have lower ratings, allowing it to win those matches, and the first higher-rated cow is as far as possible.

In other words, I need to maximize the number of cows with lower ratings before my cow's position.

But considering the tournament structure, it's not just about the number of lower-rated cows before it, but also about the sequence in which they are arranged.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the maximum number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it in the sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings in positions 1 to p-1, provided that all those cows have lower ratings than my cow.

But in reality, the tournament structure is such that the winner accumulates wins by defeating the next cow in line.

So, if I place my cow at position p, it will only get to play if it wins the previous matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of how many cows with higher ratings are before it.

If there are no cows with higher ratings before it, it can win all p-1 matches.

If there is one cow with a higher rating before it, it will lose to that cow, and so on.

Wait, maybe I can find the position p where the number of cows with higher ratings before p is minimized, and among those, choose the one with the maximum number of lower-rated cows before it.

This might be a way.

Let me formalize this.

Let me define:

- For a given position p, let left_higher[p] be the number of cows with higher ratings before position p.

- Let left_lower[p] be the number of cows with lower ratings before position p.

Then, the number of wins my cow can achieve if placed at position p is:

- If left_higher[p] == 0: left_lower[p]

- Else: left_lower[p] - left_higher[p]

But I'm not sure about this.

Wait, perhaps it's left_lower[p] minus the position where the first higher-rated cow is before p.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I place my cow at position p.

Then, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows before p that it can defeat, which are the cows with lower ratings, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, it's the number of consecutive cows with lower ratings before p, starting from position 1.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the tournament structure, the matches are sequenced such that the winner accumulates wins by defeating the next cow in line.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows before p that it can defeat, which depends on the sequence of matches.

This is too tangled.

Maybe I need to consider the tournament as a sequence of matches where the winner is determined step by step.

Let me try to simulate the tournament for a general case.

Suppose n=4, k=3, a=[5,2,8,6]

Original positions:

Pos1:5, Pos2:2, Pos3:8, Pos4:6

Matches:

1. Pos1 (5) vs Pos2 (2): 5 wins

2. Winner (5) vs Pos3 (8): 8 wins

3. Winner (8) vs Pos4 (6): 8 wins

My cow is Pos3 with 8, wins 2 matches.

Is this the maximum?

What if I swap Pos3 and Pos1?

Pos1:8, Pos2:2, Pos3:5, Pos4:6

Matches:

1. Pos1 (8) vs Pos2 (2): 8 wins

2. Winner (8) vs Pos3 (5): 8 wins

3. Winner (8) vs Pos4 (6): 8 wins

My cow (originally Pos3, now Pos1 with 8) wins 3 matches.

Wait, but in the original placement, it wins 2 matches.

So, swapping to Pos1 gives more wins.

Wait, but in this case, swapping to Pos1 gives 3 wins, which is better than the original 2.

But according to the problem, swapping should be used optimally, including the option to do nothing.

So, in this case, swapping to Pos1 gives the maximum wins.

But in the problem's example, swapping to Pos3 gives 2 wins, which is better than not swapping.

Wait, but in this new example I'm making, swapping to Pos1 gives 3 wins.

But perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing.

Wait, in the problem's second example, swapping to Pos3 gives 2 wins, which is better than not swapping.

But in this new example, swapping to Pos1 gives 3 wins.

Is there a general way to find the best position to place my cow?

I need to find the position p where the number of wins for my cow is maximized.

The number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings before p, provided that there are no cows with higher ratings before p that can defeat my cow.

Wait, perhaps the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings before p, minus the number of cows with higher ratings before p.

But that might not be accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I place my cow at position p.

Then, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings before p, provided that it can defeat them in sequence.

But in reality, it's more about the path to reach position p and defeating the previous winner.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that the number of wins for my cow at position p is equal to p - 1 - number of cows with higher ratings before p.

But in the tournament structure, it's not that straightforward.

Let me try to find another way.

Perhaps I can consider that the maximum number of wins for my cow is equal to the maximum number of consecutive lower-rated cows before it, until a higher-rated cow is encountered.

But again, considering the tournament structure, it's not directly applicable.

Maybe I need to accept that this problem requires a different perspective.

Let me look at the provided code and try to understand its logic.

Given code:

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

k -= 1

print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):

x = a[k]

ind = []

c = 0

for i in range(n):

if a[i] > x:

ind.append(i)

c += 1

if c == 2:

break

if ind == []:

return n - 1

if len(ind) == 1:

if ind[0] == 0:

return k - 1

if ind[0] > k:

return ind[0] - 1

return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)

if ind[0] == 0:

return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)

if k > ind[1]:

return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])

return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])

Wait, this code seems to have a function func_1 that takes list a, but n and k are defined outside.

But in the function, n is used without being passed as an argument.

This might cause an error because n is not defined within the function's scope.

Wait, in Python, if a variable is used in a function without being defined there, it looks for it in the outer scope.

So, if n is defined in the outer scope, it might work.

But it's generally bad practice.

Assuming that n is defined in the outer scope, let's see what the function does.

It seems that x = a[k], which is the rating of my cow.

Then, it finds the positions of cows with higher ratings than x, up to the first two occurrences.

It stores these positions in ind.

Then, based on the number of higher-rated cows found:

- If no higher-rated cows are found, return n - 1, meaning my cow can win all matches.

- If only one higher-rated cow is found:

- If that cow is at position 0, return k - 1.

- Else, if ind[0] > k, return ind[0] - 1.

- Else, return the maximum of (k - ind[0]) and (ind[0] - 1).

- If two higher-rated cows are found:

- If the first higher-rated cow is at position 0, return the minimum of (ind[1] - 1) and (k - 1).

- Else, if k > ind[1], return the maximum of (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]).

- Else, return the maximum of (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0]).

This seems like an attempt to calculate the maximum number of wins based on the positions of the higher-rated cows.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let's test it with the first example:

n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

x = a[0] = 12

Find positions with a[i] > 12:

- a[2] = 14 > 12, ind=[2], c=1

- a[3] = 11 < 12, skip

- a[4] = 8 < 12, skip

- a[5] = 3 < 12, skip

Since c < 2, ind=[2]

len(ind)==1, ind[0]=2 > k=0:

return ind[0] - 1 = 1

Which matches the first example's output of 1.

Good.

Second example:

n=6, k=5, a=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

x = a[4] = 12

Find positions with a[i] > 12:

- a[2] = 727 > 12, ind=[2], c=1

- a[5] = 13 > 12, ind=[2,5], c=2

len(ind)==2, ind[0]=2 !=0, k=4 < ind[1]=5:

return max(ind[0]-1, k - ind[0]) = max(1, 4-2)= max(1,2)=2

Which matches the second example's output of 2.

Third example:

n=2, k=2, a=[1000000000,1]

x = a[1]=1

Find positions with a[i] >1:

- a[0]=1000000000 >1, ind=[0], c=1

len(ind)==1, ind[0]=0 ==0:

return k -1 =1-1=0

Which matches the third example's output of 0.

Seems correct for these cases.

But I need to verify if this logic is generally correct.

Let me try another case.

Suppose n=4, k=3, a=[5,2,8,6]

x = a[2]=8

Find positions with a[i]>8:

- a[0]=5 <8, skip

- a[1]=2 <8, skip

- a[2]=8 ==8, but it's my cow, skip

- a[3]=6 <8, skip

ind=[]

So, return n-1=3

But in reality, if placed at pos3, it can win 2 matches.

But according to this, it returns 3.

Wait, but in reality, it can't win 3 matches because pos1 has 5, which is less than 8, but pos4 has 6, which is less than 8.

Wait, but in the tournament sequence:

- Match1: Pos1 (5) vs Pos2 (2): 5 wins

- Match2: Winner (5) vs Pos3 (8): 8 wins

- Match3: Winner (8) vs Pos4 (6): 8 wins

So, my cow at pos3 wins 2 matches.

But according to the code, it returns n-1=3.

Which is incorrect.

So, perhaps this code is flawed.

Wait, but in this case, there are no cows with higher ratings than my cow, so it should be able to win all matches, which is n-1=3.

But in reality, it wins 2 matches.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, in this setup, if my cow is at pos3, it wins 2 matches.

But according to the code, it would return n-1=3.

Which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is wrong in this case.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
