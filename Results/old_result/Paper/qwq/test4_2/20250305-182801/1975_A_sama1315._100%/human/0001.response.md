Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Mocha has an array of positive integers, and she can perform this specific operation on it any number of times. The operation is to split the array into two parts—a prefix and a suffix—and swap them. After doing this operation as many times as she wants, she wants to know if the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order.

First, I need to understand what exactly this operation allows her to do. Splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them means that she can rotate the array in a certain way. For example, if she has an array like [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], she can choose to split it into [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5], and then swap them to get [4, 1, 5, 3, 1]. Alternatively, she could split it into [3, 1, 4] and [1, 5], and swap them to get [1, 5, 3, 1, 4]. So, it's like she can perform rotations where she takes a prefix and moves it to the end, but in reverse order because of the swap.

Wait, actually, when she splits into x and y and then sets a := y + x, it's like she's rotating the array by moving the prefix to the end, but not in reverse; it's a standard rotation. For example, if she has [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and chooses x=[3, 1] and y=[4, 1, 5], then y + x = [4, 1, 5, 3, 1], which is like rotating the array by moving the first two elements to the end. So, it's similar to array rotation.

Given that, the problem reduces to checking if the array can be sorted by performing rotations. But in this case, it's specifically by swapping prefix and suffix, which is equivalent to rotation.

However, in the example provided, for the array [7, 9, 2, 2, 3], it shows that by performing two such operations, it can be sorted. Let's see:

First operation: split into x=[7] and y=[9, 2, 2, 3], then a becomes [9, 2, 2, 3, 7].

Second operation: split into x=[9] and y=[2, 2, 3, 7], then a becomes [2, 2, 3, 7, 9], which is sorted.

So, it's possible to sort the array by performing such operations.

Now, I need to generalize this. Given that the array can be rotated in this way any number of times, I need to check if it's possible to sort it in non-decreasing order.

One thing I know is that in a sorted array, the smallest element is at the beginning. So, perhaps I need to find the minimum element and see if rotating the array so that this element is at the beginning makes the array sorted.

But wait, that's not always true because there might be multiple instances of the same element. So, I need to be careful.

Another approach is to find all possible rotations and check if any of them is sorted. But given that n can be up to 50 and t can be up to 1000, this might not be efficient enough, although it's manageable since n is small.

But let's think smarter. Since each operation is a rotation, performing multiple rotations is equivalent to rotating the array by the sum of the rotation amounts, modulo n. Wait, but since each rotation is defined by splitting into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them, it's equivalent to rotating the array by the length of the prefix.

So, if I choose a prefix of length k, then the rotation is by k positions. So, by performing multiple such rotations, can I achieve any permutation of the array?

Well, in standard array rotation, performing rotations by different amounts allows you to achieve any rotation of the array. For example, in standard array rotation, rotating by 1 position multiple times allows you to reach any rotation.

But in this problem, the rotation amount is determined by the length of the prefix chosen each time. So, it's not entirely free; it's constrained by the possible prefix lengths.

Wait, actually, in this operation, the prefix can be of any length from 0 to n-1, since x can be empty or the entire array except the last element.

Given that, I can choose to rotate the array by any number of positions, from 0 to n-1, in a single operation. So, in one operation, I can rotate the array by any amount.

Therefore, by performing multiple operations, I can achieve any rotation of the array.

But, in the problem, the operation is to split into x and y and swap them, which is equivalent to rotating the array by the length of x.

So, if I can choose any x, from length 0 to n-1, then I can rotate the array by any amount from 0 to n-1 in a single operation.

Therefore, in one operation, I can achieve any rotation of the array.

Wait, that can't be right. Because rotating by k positions is equivalent to choosing x of length k and y of length n - k, then swapping them to get y + x, which is equivalent to rotating the array by k positions.

So, in one operation, I can rotate the array by any k, where 0 ≤ k < n.

Therefore, in one operation, I can reach any rotation of the array.

Therefore, the array can be sorted if there exists any rotation that is sorted.

So, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This is a standard problem in array rotation. To check if an array can be sorted by rotation, we can look for the number of times the array elements are decreasing. If the array is rotated from a sorted array, there should be at most one such decrease.

Wait, but in this problem, we can perform multiple operations, which correspond to multiple rotations. But since each operation can be any rotation, effectively, we can reach any rotation of the array.

Therefore, we just need to check if there exists any rotation of the array that is sorted.

So, to solve this, I can concatenate the array with itself and then check if the sorted array is a subarray of this concatenated array.

That is, if I concatenate a with itself, forming a new array of length 2n, then I can check if any subarray of length n is equal to the sorted array.

This is an efficient way to check all possible rotations.

Let me think about the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at func_1(a):

n = len(a)

sorted_a = sorted(a)

concatenated_a = a + a

for i in range(n):

if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:

return 'Yes'

return 'No'

This seems to be implementing exactly what I just thought. It sorts the array and then checks if this sorted array appears as a subarray in the concatenated array a + a. If it does, then there exists a rotation that is sorted, and it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'.

This seems correct.

Now, func_2 reads the input, processes each test case using func_1, and collects the results, which are then printed joined by newline.

This also seems correct.

Looking back at the example:

Test case 1: n=6, a=[1,1,4,5,1,4]

Sorted a=[1,1,4,4,5,1] (Wait, no, sorted a should be [1,1,4,4,5,5], but in the example, it's [1,1,4,5,1,4]. Wait, no, the sorted array should be [1,1,4,4,5,5], but in the example, it's said that it cannot be sorted, so perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, in the example, the output is "No", meaning that no rotation results in a sorted array.

According to the program, it would check if [1,1,4,5,1,4] or any rotation of it matches [1,1,4,4,5,5], which it doesn't, so it correctly returns 'No'.

Test case 2: n=5, a=[7,9,2,2,3]

Sorted a=[2,2,3,7,9]

Concatenated a=[7,9,2,2,3,7,9,2,2,3]

Checking substrings of length 5:

- [7,9,2,2,3] ≠ [2,2,3,7,9]

- [9,2,2,3,7] ≠ [2,2,3,7,9]

- [2,2,3,7,9] == [2,2,3,7,9]

So, it returns 'Yes', which matches the example.

Test case 3: n=3, a=[1,2,3]

Sorted a=[1,2,3]

Concatenated a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

Checking substrings of length 3:

- [1,2,3] == [1,2,3]

So, returns 'Yes', which matches the example.

Therefore, the program seems to be correct.

I don't see any flaws in this approach given the constraints.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
