Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a larger array of m integers, where m is at least n. Vasya wants to make his array as different as possible from Petya's array, measured by the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements.

So, the goal is to maximize the sum D = Σ |a_i - c_i|, where c is Vasya's array constructed from m integers.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

- There are multiple test cases, up to 100.

- For each test case:

- n and m are given, with 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2*10^5.

- Then, an array a of n integers, each between 1 and 10^9.

- Then, an array b of m integers, each between 1 and 10^9.

- It's guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

Given that m can be up to 2*10^5 and there can be up to 100 test cases, but the total sum of m is limited to 2*10^5, I need to make sure my solution is efficient, probably O(m log m) per test case at worst.

Now, thinking about how to maximize the sum of absolute differences. To maximize |a_i - c_i| for each a_i, I would ideally want to pair each a_i with either the smallest or the largest possible c_i from the available b's, depending on a_i's value.

Wait, but I need to choose n integers from b and arrange them in a specific order. So, I need to select n elements from b and assign them to positions corresponding to a's elements to maximize the sum of absolute differences.

Hmm, this sounds like I need to select n elements from b and pair them with a's elements in a way that maximizes the sum of absolute differences.

One approach that comes to mind is to sort both arrays and pair the elements in a way that maximizes the differences. But since the arrays could be of different sizes, and I need to choose only n elements from b, I need to be careful.

Let me think differently. Since I can choose any n elements from b and arrange them in any order, independent of their original order in b, I can treat b as a sorted list and pick elements from it to pair with a's elements.

Wait, perhaps I should sort b and then for each a_i, choose the element from b that maximizes |a_i - something|.

But I have to choose n elements from b without replacement, meaning once I choose an element from b for one a_i, I can't use it again for another a_j.

So, it's like assigning unique elements from b to a's elements to maximize the sum of differences.

This sounds similar to assignment problems in optimization, where you want to maximize the sum of pairwise differences.

In such cases, using a greedy approach might work, but I need to ensure that it's correct.

Let me consider sorting both arrays.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order.

Then, for each a_i, the potential candidates in b to maximize |a_i - b_j| would be either the smallest or the largest elements in b, depending on a_i.

Wait, actually, for each a_i, the maximum possible |a_i - b_j| would be either |a_i - min(b)| or |a_i - max(b)|.

But I need to choose n elements from b, without repetition, to pair with a's elements.

So, perhaps for each a_i, I can consider the two options: pairing with the smallest or the largest available element in b, and choose the one that gives the maximum difference, while ensuring that the elements chosen are unique.

This sounds a bit tricky because choosing an element for one a_i affects the choices for other a_i's.

Maybe I need to prioritize a_i's in a certain way.

Another idea: since I can arrange c in any order, the order of b's elements doesn't matter except for their values.

So, perhaps I can sort a and sort b, and then decide for each a_i which element from b to pair with, either from the start or the end of b.

Wait, perhaps a two-pointer approach would work.

Let me think about sorting both a and b.

If I sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order, then for each a_i, I can choose either the smallest or the largest available element in b to maximize |a_i - b_j|.

But I need to make sure that the elements chosen from b are unique.

So, maybe I can use a two-pointer approach where I have one pointer at the start of b and one at the end, and for each a_i, I choose the end that gives the maximum difference.

Wait, but I need to pair a_i's with b_j's in a way that maximizes the sum.

This sounds similar to matching a_i's with b_j's where for each a_i, I choose the b_j that maximizes |a_i - b_j|, but with the constraint that each b_j is used at most once.

This is starting to sound like a matching problem, possibly solvable with greedy algorithms.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Sort array b in ascending order.

2. For each a_i, calculate the potential differences with the smallest and largest elements in the remaining part of b.

3. Choose the end (smallest or largest) that gives the maximum difference for a_i.

4. Assign that b_j to a_i and remove it from b.

But I need to do this for all a_i's, and ensure that the total sum is maximized.

I think this can be implemented using a heap (priority queue) to keep track of the maximum differences available at each step.

Here's an idea:

- Sort b in ascending order.

- Initialize a max-heap where each element is the negative of the difference |a_i - b_j|, along with the indices or references to a_i and the position in b.

- For each a_i, push the negative of the differences with the smallest and largest elements in b into the heap.

- Then, for n times, pop the largest difference (smallest negative value) from the heap.

- Assign that b_j to a_i and remove b_j from consideration by updating the pointers for b.

Wait, but I need to ensure that each b_j is used only once.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand how it's implemented.

Looking at the provided code:

- It reads t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads n and m.

- Reads array a of n integers.

- Reads array b of m integers.

- Sorts b in ascending order.

- Initializes a max-heap.

- Initializes tp1 to 0 and tp2 to m-1.

- For each a_i, calculates the differences with b[0] and b[m-1], pushes the negative difference and the indices into the max-heap.

- Then, for n times, pops the element with the largest difference (smallest negative value).

- Checks if the b_j index is still available (i.e., not less than tp1 or greater than tp2).

- If it's not available, calculates the new differences with the current tp1 and tp2, assigns the difference, and moves tp1 or tp2 accordingly.

- If it's available, assigns the stored difference, and moves tp1 or tp2 accordingly.

- Finally, prints the accumulated sum.

This seems to be implementing the idea I was considering, using a heap to keep track of the best differences available.

Let me verify if this approach is correct.

First, sorting b is a good start.

Then, for each a_i, it calculates the potential differences with the smallest and largest elements in b, and stores them in a max-heap.

Then, it iteratively selects the largest available difference, assigning the corresponding b_j to a_i, and updates the pointers tp1 and tp2 to ensure that b_j is not used again.

This seems logically sound.

But I need to make sure that this indeed maximizes the total sum D.

An alternative approach I can think of is:

- Sort both a and b.

- Then, for each a_i, pair it with either b_j or b_k, where b_j is the smallest available and b_k is the largest available.

- Choose the one that gives the maximum difference and remove that b_j or b_k from future selections.

This is similar to the provided solution.

I think this approach is correct because for each a_i, you're giving priority to the maximum possible difference available at that step, ensuring that the total sum is maximized.

Moreover, by using a heap, you can efficiently get the maximum difference available in O(log n) time, and updating the available b_j's using tp1 and tp2 pointers maintains the efficiency.

Given that the sum of m over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, and n <= m, the time complexity should be acceptable.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.
