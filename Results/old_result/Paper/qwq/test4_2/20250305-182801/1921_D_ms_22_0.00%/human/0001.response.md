Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a larger array of m integers, where m is at least n. Vasya wants to make his array as different as possible from Petya's array, measured by the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements.

My goal is to help Vasya find the maximum possible total difference D.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what I'm supposed to do with them.

- There are multiple test cases, and the first line tells me how many test cases there are (t ≤ 100).

- For each test case:

- The first line has two integers, n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2*10^5).

- The second line has n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

- The third line has m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).

- It's guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.

- I need to output, for each test case, a single integer representing the maximum D that Vasya can achieve.

Okay, so the constraints are relatively large, which means I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n + m log m) or better per test case.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Vasya needs to select n integers from the m available and arrange them in a specific order to maximize the sum of absolute differences with Petya's array.

So, for each element in Petya's array a_i, I need to pair it with an element from Vasya's selected array c_i to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

To maximize the sum of absolute differences, I should pair each a_i with a c_i that is as far away from a_i as possible.

Given that Vasya can choose any n elements from the m available and arrange them in any order, I need to select c_i's such that the sum of |a_i - c_i| is maximized.

One way to think about this is to pair smaller a_i's with larger c_i's and larger a_i's with smaller c_i's, but I need to be careful about how I select and arrange the c_i's.

Let me consider sorting both arrays.

If I sort Petya's array a in ascending order and Vasya's array c in descending order, then pairing them would maximize the differences.

Wait, but Vasya can choose only n elements from m, so I need to select which elements to include in c.

Moreover, Vasya can arrange them in any order, so the order can be arranged to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

I need a strategy to select n elements from b and arrange them to maximize the sum of absolute differences with a.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Sort Petya's array a in ascending order.

2. Sort Vasya's array b in ascending order.

3. For each a_i, find the c_i in b that maximizes |a_i - c_i|, considering the selection of n elements from b.

But this seems too simplistic because I need to select n distinct elements from b and arrange them optimally against a.

Another idea: since Vasya can arrange the selected elements in any order, I can think of assigning the largest possible c_i to the smallest a_i and the smallest possible c_i to the largest a_i, to maximize the differences.

Wait, perhaps I should sort a in ascending order and select c_i's in a way that the smallest a_i is paired with the largest possible c_i, and the largest a_i is paired with the smallest possible c_i.

But I need to select only n elements from b, so I need to choose which elements to pick.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the elements that Vasya selects from b, and then arrange them to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|. To maximize this sum, I should pair each a_i with a c_j that is as far away as possible.

Given that, it might be beneficial to pair small a_i's with large c_j's and large a_i's with small c_j's.

But I need to select only n elements from b, so I need to choose which elements to pick to maximize this sum.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- Use two pointers to select elements from b that are either the smallest or the largest available, depending on which gives the maximum difference for each a_i.

Wait, perhaps a greedy approach where for each a_i, I choose the c_i from b that maximizes |a_i - c_i|, considering the remaining choices.

But since Vasya can arrange the selected c_i's in any order, I need to select n elements from b and then arrange them to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

This sounds like I need to select n elements from b and pair them with a_i's in a way that maximizes the sum of absolute differences.

Given that, perhaps I can use a matching algorithm that pairs a_i's with c_i's to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

But that sounds complicated, and with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient solution.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I fix a_i's and consider the possible c_i's.

For each a_i, the maximum possible |a_i - c_i| would be max(|a_i - b_min|, |a_i - b_max|), where b_min and b_max are the smallest and largest elements in b.

But since I need to select n elements from b, I need to choose which elements to use for each a_i.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- Use two pointers: one at the beginning of b (smallest element) and one at the end of b (largest element).

- For each a_i, choose the c_i that maximizes |a_i - c_i| from the available elements in b.

- To do this efficiently, keep track of which elements in b have been selected.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need something more efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can preselect n elements from b that will maximize the sum of differences when paired with a_i's.

But how?

Let me think about the overall sum D.

D = sum_{i=1 to n} |a_i - c_i|

I need to maximize D by choosing n elements c_i from b and arranging them appropriately.

I need to maximize the sum of absolute differences.

Given that, perhaps I can consider the maximum and minimum elements in b and pair them strategically with a_i's.

Wait, maybe I can consider the following:

- For each a_i, find the c_i in b that maximizes |a_i - c_i|.

- But since I need to select n distinct c_i's, I need to ensure that each c_i is used only once.

This sounds like an assignment problem, where I need to assign each a_i to a unique c_i to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

This can be modeled as a bipartite matching problem, but with n and m up to 2*10^5, it's too slow to use the Hungarian algorithm or any general assignment algorithm.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider sorting both arrays.

Sort a in ascending order: a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an

Sort b in ascending order: b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ... ≤ bm

Now, I need to select n elements from b and arrange them in some order to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

I need to choose c_i's such that the sum of |a_i - c_i| is maximized.

I need to think about how to pair a_i's with c_i's.

One idea is to pair the smallest a_i's with the largest possible c_i's and the largest a_i's with the smallest possible c_i's.

This way, the differences |a_i - c_i| are maximized.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define c as a permutation of n elements selected from b.

We want to maximize sum_{i=1 to n} |a_i - c_i|.

To maximize this sum, we can try to pair small a_i's with large c_i's and large a_i's with small c_i's.

So, one possible strategy is:

- Pair the smallest a_i with the largest available c_i.

- Pair the second smallest a_i with the second largest available c_i.

- And so on.

But I need to ensure that the c_i's are selected optimally.

Wait, perhaps I can select the n largest and n smallest elements from b and pair them accordingly.

But b can have duplicates, so I need to be careful.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example from the input:

n=4, m=6

a = [6,1,2,4]

b = [3,5,1,7,2,3]

After sorting:

a = [1,2,4,6]

b = [1,2,3,3,5,7]

To maximize D, pair the smallest a_i with the largest b_i, and the largest a_i with the smallest b_i.

So, pair 1 with 7: |1-7|=6

Pair 2 with 5: |2-5|=3

Pair 4 with 3: |4-3|=1

Pair 6 with 2: |6-2|=4

Total D = 6+3+1+4 = 14

But in the sample input, it says the output is 16. So, something's wrong with this approach.

Wait, in the note, it says that one possible array is (1,5,7,2), which gives D=5+4+5+2=16.

Wait, so my approach gave 14, but 16 is possible.

So, my initial strategy is not optimal.

I need a better way.

Let me think differently.

I need to select n elements from b and arrange them in any order to maximize sum |a_i - c_i|.

This sounds like I need to select c_i's and arrange them to maximize the differences.

Perhaps I can consider that for each a_i, the best c_i to pair with it is either the smallest possible c_i or the largest possible c_i, depending on which gives a larger difference.

But I need to select n distinct c_i's.

Wait, maybe I can use a greedy approach where I select for each a_i the c_i that gives the maximum difference, without reusing c_i's.

But that would be too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- Use two pointers: one at the start of b (smallest elements) and one at the end of b (largest elements).

- For each a_i, choose the c_i that gives the maximum difference without reusing c_i's.

But I need to decide for each a_i whether to pair it with the smallest remaining c_i or the largest remaining c_i.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, but n and m are too large for that.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the following observation:

For each a_i, the maximum possible |a_i - c_i| is max(|a_i - b_min|, |a_i - b_max|).

But since I need to select n distinct c_i's, I cannot simply choose b_max or b_min for each a_i.

I need to select a set of c_i's that maximizes the sum of their differences when paired optimally with a_i's.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about another perspective.

Suppose I fix the c_i's that Vasya selects from b, and then arrange them to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

To maximize this sum, I should pair each a_i with a c_j such that |a_i - c_j| is as large as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can select c_i's that are as different as possible from a_i's.

But I need a concrete plan.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- Use two pointers: one at the start of b and one at the end of b.

- For each a_i, choose the c_i that gives the maximum difference, either from the start or the end of b, without reusing c_i's.

This sounds similar to what I thought earlier, but perhaps I can implement it efficiently.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize:

- Sort a: a_sorted

- Sort b: b_sorted

- Initialize two pointers: left = 0, right = m-1

- Initialize ans = 0

- For each a_i in a_sorted:

- Choose c_i as b_sorted[left] or b_sorted[right], whichever gives the larger |a_i - c_i|

- Add |a_i - c_i| to ans

- Move the pointer accordingly: if c_i == b_sorted[left], left +=1; else right -=1

But wait, this might not be optimal, as seen in the first example.

In the first example:

a_sorted = [1,2,4,6]

b_sorted = [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Following this approach:

First a_i =1, choose c_i=7, |1-7|=6, ans=6, right=4

Next a_i=2, choose c_i=1, |2-1|=1, ans=7, left=1

Next a_i=4, choose c_i=5, |4-5|=1, ans=8, right=3

Next a_i=6, choose c_i=3, |6-3|=3, ans=11

Total D=11, but the sample output is 16.

So, this approach gives 11, but 16 is possible.

Hence, this approach is not correct.

I need a better strategy.

Let me think about maximizing the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

Since |a_i - c_i| is the absolute difference, it's always non-negative, so I want to maximize each term individually.

Given that, I need to select c_i's such that each |a_i - c_i| is as large as possible, and the c_i's are distinct and come from b.

This seems similar to assigning each a_i to the farthest available c_i.

But I need to be careful with the selection to maximize the overall sum.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that for each a_i, I have two options:

- Pair it with the smallest possible c_i

- Pair it with the largest possible c_i

But I need to select n distinct c_i's, so I need to choose which c_i's to use for each a_i without reusing them.

This sounds like I need to select a subset of c_i's that maximizes the sum of their differences when paired optimally with a_i's.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider the following idea:

- For each a_i, calculate the difference if paired with b_min and with b_max.

- Then, select n elements from b such that the sum of these differences is maximized.

But again, I need a way to implement this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can use a priority queue to select the best possible c_i for each a_i.

Let me try to think differently.

I recall that in some optimization problems, we can use the concept of matching in bipartite graphs, but that's too slow for this problem.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as selecting n elements from b and arranging them to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

Given that, maybe I can consider the differences and select the best possible assignments.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- For each a_i, calculate the difference with b[0] and b[m-1].

- Push these differences (with signs) into a max heap.

- Then, for each a_i, pop the maximum difference from the heap, and assign the corresponding c_i to a_i.

- Ensure that the same c_i is not assigned to multiple a_i's.

This sounds promising.

Let me try it with the first example.

a_sorted = [1,2,4,6]

b_sorted = [1,2,3,3,5,7]

For a_i=1:

diff with b[0]=0, with b[5]=6 → push (-6, a_i=1, index=5)

For a_i=2:

diff with b[0]=1, with b[5]=5 → push (-5, a_i=2, index=5)

For a_i=4:

diff with b[0]=3, with b[5]=3 → push (-3, a_i=4, index=5)

For a_i=6:

diff with b[0]=5, with b[5]=1 → push (-1, a_i=6, index=5)

Now, the max heap contains:

(-1,6,5), (-3,4,5), (-5,2,5), (-6,1,5)

First pop (-1,6,5):

Assign c_i=7 to a_i=6, D +=1, used_indices={5}

Next pop (-3,4,5):

But index=5 is used, so find the next best for a_i=4.

Look for the next highest difference for a_i=4, which would be diff with b[0]=3.

So, assign c_i=1 to a_i=4, D +=3, used_indices={5,0}

Next pop (-5,2,5):

Index=5 is used, so find next best for a_i=2.

Next best is diff with b[0]=1, but that's already used (index=0).

So, find the next available b_i.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

I need a better way to handle used indices.

Maybe instead of using indices, I can keep track of which b_i's are available.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way.

Perhaps I can use two pointers for the available b_i's.

Let me try to think differently.

I need to maximize sum |a_i - c_i|, where c_i are n distinct elements from b, arranged in any order.

I need to maximize the sum of absolute differences.

Let me consider that for each a_i, the best c_i to pair with is either the smallest b_j or the largest b_j, whichever gives the larger difference.

Given that, I can precompute for each a_i, the maximum difference possible with either b_min or b_max.

Then, I need to select n elements from b to assign to a_i's such that the sum of these maximum differences is maximized.

This sounds like I need to select n elements from b that maximize the sum of their assigned differences.

But I need to ensure that each c_i is used only once.

This seems similar to assigning a_i's to c_i's based on the maximum difference possible.

I need a way to select n elements from b and assign them to a_i's to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- Use two pointers: one at the start of b (smallest elements) and one at the end of b (largest elements).

- For each a_i, choose the c_i that gives the maximum difference without reusing c_i's.

- To do this, for each a_i, check if pairing with the current smallest b_j or the current largest b_j gives a larger difference, and choose accordingly.

- Move the pointer accordingly.

But in the first example, this approach gave me D=11, while the sample output is 16.

So, I need a better way.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

4 6

6 1 2 4

3 5 1 7 2 3

Sample Output:

16

In the note, it says that one possible array is (1,5,7,2), giving D=5+4+5+2=16.

So, c_i's selected are 1,5,7,2.

Wait, in my previous approach, I selected c_i's as 7,1,5,3, giving D=6+1+1+3=11, which is worse.

So, why is my approach not selecting the same c_i's as in the sample?

Perhaps I need to prioritize selecting the maximum difference available at each step.

Let me think about a different greedy strategy.

What if I always select the c_i that gives the maximum possible difference for any a_i at each step?

Here's how it would work:

- Find the a_i that can be paired with a c_j to give the maximum |a_i - c_j| among all possible pairs.

- Assign that pair and remove that c_j from further selection.

- Repeat until all a_i's are assigned.

This sounds similar to always picking the highest difference available.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to implement this.

This sounds like a greedy approach, and it might work.

Let me try it with the first example.

a_sorted = [1,2,4,6]

b_sorted = [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Find the pair with the maximum difference:

- a_i=1 with b_j=7: |1-7|=6

- a_i=2 with b_j=7: |2-7|=5

- a_i=4 with b_j=7: |4-7|=3

- a_i=6 with b_j=7: |6-7|=1

- a_i=1 with b_j=1: |1-1|=0

- a_i=2 with b_j=1: |2-1|=1

- a_i=4 with b_j=1: |4-1|=3

- a_i=6 with b_j=1: |6-1|=5

- Similarly for other b_j's.

The maximum difference is 6, which is a_i=1 with b_j=7.

Assign c_i=7 to a_i=1, D +=6, remove b_j=7.

Now, a_remaining = [2,4,6], b_remaining = [1,2,3,3,5]

Next, find the pair with the maximum difference among remaining a_i's and b_j's.

Possible differences:

- a_i=2 with b_j=5: |2-5|=3

- a_i=2 with b_j=1: |2-1|=1

- a_i=4 with b_j=5: |4-5|=1

- a_i=4 with b_j=1: |4-1|=3

- a_i=6 with b_j=5: |6-5|=1

- a_i=6 with b_j=1: |6-1|=5

The maximum is 5, which is a_i=6 with b_j=1.

Assign c_i=1 to a_i=6, D +=5, remove b_j=1.

Now, a_remaining = [2,4], b_remaining = [2,3,3,5]

Next, find the pair with the maximum difference among remaining a_i's and b_j's.

Possible differences:

- a_i=2 with b_j=5: |2-5|=3

- a_i=2 with b_j=2: |2-2|=0

- a_i=4 with b_j=5: |4-5|=1

- a_i=4 with b_j=2: |4-2|=2

- a_i=4 with b_j=3: |4-3|=1

The maximum is 3, which is a_i=2 with b_j=5.

Assign c_i=5 to a_i=2, D +=3, remove b_j=5.

Now, a_remaining = [4], b_remaining = [2,3,3]

Finally, assign a_i=4 with b_j=3, |4-3|=1, D +=1.

Total D=6+5+3+1=15, which is still less than the sample output of 16.

Hmm, so this approach gives D=15, but the sample output is 16.

So, perhaps even this greedy approach is not optimal.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that there can be multiple c_i's with the same value, as in the sample input where there are two 3's in b.

Maybe that's why my approach is missing out on a better pairing.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each a_i, I have two options: pair it with the smallest available c_i or the largest available c_i.

But I need to select n distinct c_i's, so I need to keep track of which c_i's are used.

This seems too time-consuming.

Let me consider another perspective.

I need to maximize sum |a_i - c_i|.

This can be seen as maximizing the sum of distances between a_i and c_i.

Perhaps I can consider the total possible sum of differences and subtract the minimum sum of differences.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the c_i's that Vasya selects from b, and then arrange them to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate over all possible subsets of b of size n and find the arrangement that maximizes the sum, but that's not feasible due to the large constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the following observation:

To maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, I should pair smaller a_i's with larger c_i's and larger a_i's with smaller c_i's.

This way, the differences are maximized.

Given that, perhaps I can sort a in ascending order and select c_i's in descending order, or vice versa.

Wait, in the first approach, I tried sorting a in ascending order and pairing with c_i's from both ends, but it didn't give the correct answer.

Let me try another example.

Take the second test case:

3 4

1 1 1

1 1 1 1

In this case, all a_i's are 1, and all b_i's are 1.

So, no matter what c_i's I choose, D = sum |1 - 1| = 0.

Which matches the sample output.

Third test case:

5 5

1 2 3 4 5

1 2 3 4 5

Here, if I pair each a_i with a c_i such that c_i is as far away as possible, I can pair:

a_i=1 with c_i=5: |1-5|=4

a_i=2 with c_i=4: |2-4|=2

a_i=3 with c_i=3: |3-3|=0

a_i=4 with c_i=2: |4-2|=2

a_i=5 with c_i=1: |5-1|=4

Total D=4+2+0+2+4=12, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, pairing a_i's with c_i's from the opposite ends gives the maximum D.

Similarly, in the first test case, pairing a_i=1 with c_i=7, a_i=2 with c_i=5, a_i=4 with c_i=3, a_i=6 with c_i=2 gives D=6+3+1+4=14, but the sample output is 16.

Wait, maybe there's a better pairing.

In the note, it says that c_i's can be (1,5,7,2), giving D=5+4+5+2=16.

So, a_i=1 with c_i=1: |1-1|=0

a_i=2 with c_i=5: |2-5|=3

a_i=4 with c_i=7: |4-7|=3

a_i=6 with c_i=2: |6-2|=4

Total D=0+3+3+4=10, which is different from the note's calculation.

Wait, in the note, it says c_i's are (1,5,7,2), and differences are |6-1|=5, |1-5|=4, |2-7|=5, |4-2|=2, sum=16.

Wait, but if c_i's are (1,5,7,2), and a_i's are (6,1,2,4), then:

|6-1|=5

|1-5|=4

|2-7|=5

|4-2|=2

Total D=5+4+5+2=16.

So, in this arrangement, c_i's are assigned in a specific order to a_i's to maximize D.

So, perhaps I need to select n c_i's and arrange them in a specific order to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

This suggests that the arrangement order matters.

Given that, perhaps I need to select n c_i's and then arrange them in a way that maximizes the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

This sounds like minimizing the sum of a_i * c_i in some way, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the sum of |a_i - c_i| as the sum of (a_i - c_i) when a_i > c_i, and (c_i - a_i) when c_i > a_i.

But I need to maximize this sum.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that the maximum possible D is achieved when each a_i is paired with the c_i that is as far away as possible from a_i.

Given that, perhaps I can select c_i's such that for each a_i, c_i is either the smallest or the largest possible from b, depending on which gives the larger difference.

But I need to ensure that each c_i is used only once.

This sounds like I need to select n c_i's that maximize the sum of their differences when paired optimally with a_i's.

This seems too abstract.

Let me think about the following plan:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- Use two pointers: left pointing to the smallest elements in b, and right pointing to the largest elements in b.

- For each a_i, choose the c_i that gives the maximum difference without reusing c_i's.

- To do this, compare the difference between a_i and b[left], and a_i and b[right], and choose the one with the larger difference.

- If I choose b[left], increment left; if I choose b[right], decrement right.

This is similar to my initial approach but seems to fail in the first test case.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust this approach.

Let me try implementing this approach step by step for the first test case.

a_sorted = [1,2,4,6]

b_sorted = [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Initialize left=0, right=5

First a_i=1:

diff_with_left = |1-1|=0

diff_with_right= |1-7|=6

Choose right, c_i=7, D +=6, right=4

Now, a_i=2:

diff_with_left=|2-1|=1

diff_with_right=|2-5|=3

Choose right, c_i=5, D +=3, right=3

Now, a_i=4:

diff_with_left=|4-1|=3

diff_with_right=|4-3|=1

Choose left, c_i=1, D +=3, left=1

Now, a_i=6:

diff_with_left=|6-2|=4

diff_with_right=|6-3|=3

Choose left, c_i=2, D +=4, left=2

Total D=6+3+3+4=16, which matches the sample output.

Wait a minute, in my earlier attempt, I got D=11, but following this step-by-step, I get D=16.

So, perhaps this approach works.

I must have made a mistake in my earlier implementation.

Let me try another test case to verify.

Third test case:

a_sorted = [1,2,3,4,5]

b_sorted = [1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize left=0, right=4

First a_i=1:

diff_with_left=0, diff_with_right=4 → choose right, c_i=5, D +=4, right=3

Next a_i=2:

diff_with_left=1, diff_with_right=3 → choose right, c_i=4, D +=3, right=2

Next a_i=3:

diff_with_left=2, diff_with_right=1 → choose left, c_i=1, D +=2, left=1

Next a_i=4:

diff_with_left=3, diff_with_right=3 → choose either, say left, c_i=2, D +=3, left=2

Next a_i=5:

diff_with_left=3, diff_with_right=3 → choose either, say left, c_i=3, D +=3, left=3

Total D=4+3+2+3+3=15, but the sample output is 12.

Wait, that's different from the sample output of 12.

In the sample explanation, they paired a_i=1 with c_i=5, a_i=2 with c_i=4, a_i=3 with c_i=3, a_i=4 with c_i=2, a_i=5 with c_i=1, giving D=4+2+0+2+4=12.

So, in this case, my approach gives D=15, which is better than the sample pairing that gives D=12.

But according to the sample output, it should be 12.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the differences.

Wait, in my approach:

- a_i=1 with c_i=5: |1-5|=4

- a_i=2 with c_i=4: |2-4|=2

- a_i=3 with c_i=1: |3-1|=2

- a_i=4 with c_i=2: |4-2|=2

- a_i=5 with c_i=3: |5-3|=2

Total D=4+2+2+2+2=12, which matches the sample output.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought D=15, but actually, it's 12.

So, this approach works for both the first and third test cases.

Let me check another test case.

Take the second test case:

a_sorted = [1,1,1]

b_sorted = [1,1,1,1]

Initialize left=0, right=3

First a_i=1:

diff_with_left=0, diff_with_right=0 → choose either, say left, c_i=1, D +=0, left=1

Next a_i=1:

diff_with_left=0, diff_with_right=0 → choose left, c_i=1, D +=0, left=2

Next a_i=1:

diff_with_left=0, diff_with_right=0 → choose left, c_i=1, D +=0, left=3

Total D=0, which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=2, m=6

a=[5,8]

b=[8,7,5,8,2,10]

Sort a: [5,8]

Sort b: [2,5,7,8,8,10]

Initialize left=0, right=5

First a_i=5:

diff_with_left=|5-2|=3

diff_with_right=|5-10|=5 → choose right, c_i=10, D +=5, right=4

Next a_i=8:

diff_with_left=|8-2|=6

diff_with_right=|8-8|=0 → choose left, c_i=2, D +=6, left=1

Total D=5+6=11, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case:

n=4, m=6

a=[8,10,6,4]

b=[3,10,6,1,8,9]

Sort a: [4,6,8,10]

Sort b: [1,3,6,8,9,10]

Initialize left=0, right=5

First a_i=4:

diff_with_left=|4-1|=3

diff_with_right=|4-10|=6 → choose right, c_i=10, D +=6, right=4

Next a_i=6:

diff_with_left=|6-1|=5

diff_with_right=|6-9|=3 → choose left, c_i=1, D +=5, left=1

Next a_i=8:

diff_with_left=|8-3|=5

diff_with_right=|8-9|=1 → choose left, c_i=3, D +=5, left=2

Next a_i=10:

diff_with_left=|10-6|=4

diff_with_right=|10-8|=2 → choose left, c_i=6, D +=4, left=3

Total D=6+5+5+4=20, but in the sample input, for this test case, the output is 25.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Wait, in the sample input, for this test case, the output is 25.

So, my approach gives D=20, which is less than the sample output of 25.

So, my approach is still not optimal.

Hmm, seems like I need to think differently.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

4 6

8 10 6 4

3 10 6 1 8 9

Sample Output:

25

In the note, it says that one possible array is (3,10,9,8), giving D=5+0+3+2=10, but that doesn't match the sample output.

Wait, perhaps I misread the note.

Wait, in the note, for the first test case, it shows a different pairing.

But for this test case, the sample output is 25, and my approach gives 20.

So, I need to find a better pairing.

Let me try to find a pairing that gives D=25.

Possible pairings:

a_i=4 with c_i=1: |4-1|=3

a_i=6 with c_i=3: |6-3|=3

a_i=8 with c_i=9: |8-9|=1

a_i=10 with c_i=10: |10-10|=0

Total D=3+3+1+0=7, which is less than 25.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

9

4 6

6 1 2 4

3 5 1 7 2 3

3 4

1 1 1

1 1 1 1

5 5

1 2 3 4 5

1 2 3 4 5

2 6

5 8

8 7 5 8 2 10

2 2

4 1

9 6

4 6

8 10 6 4

3 10 6 1 8 9

3 5

6 5 2

1 7 9 7 2

5 5

9 10 6 3 7

5 9 2 3 9

1 6

2 7 10 1 1 5

Output:

16

0

12

11

10

23

15

25

7

So, for the test case:

n=4, m=6

a=[8,10,6,4]

b=[3,10,6,1,8,9]

Output:25

I need to find a pairing that gives D=25.

Let me try different pairings.

Possible c_i's: [1,3,6,8,9,10]

a_i=4 can be paired with:

- 1: |4-1|=3

- 3: |4-3|=1

- 6: |4-6|=2

- 8: |4-8|=4

- 9: |4-9|=5

- 10: |4-10|=6

a_i=6 can be paired with:

- 1: |6-1|=5

- 3: |6-3|=3

- 6: |6-6|=0

- 8: |6-8|=2

- 9: |6-9|=3

- 10: |6-10|=4

a_i=8 can be paired with:

- 1: |8-1|=7

- 3: |8-3|=5

- 6: |8-6|=2

- 8: |8-8|=0

- 9: |8-9|=1

- 10: |8-10|=2

a_i=10 can be paired with:

- 1: |10-1|=9

- 3: |10-3|=7

- 6: |10-6|=4

- 8: |10-8|=2

- 9: |10-9|=1

- 10: |10-10|=0

Now, to maximize the sum, I need to select four different c_i's that maximize the sum of these differences.

One possible pairing:

- a_i=4 with c_i=10: |4-10|=6

- a_i=6 with c_i=1: |6-1|=5

- a_i=8 with c_i=3: |8-3|=5

- a_i=10 with c_i=9: |10-9|=1

Total D=6+5+5+1=17

Still less than 25.

Another pairing:

- a_i=4 with c_i=1: |4-1|=3

- a_i=6 with c_i=9: |6-9|=3

- a_i=8 with c_i=10: |8-10|=2

- a_i=10 with c_i=8: |10-8|=2

Total D=3+3+2+2=10

Worse.

Another pairing:

- a_i=4 with c_i=3: |4-3|=1

- a_i=6 with c_i=1: |6-1|=5

- a_i=8 with c_i=9: |8-9|=1

- a_i=10 with c_i=10: |10-10|=0
