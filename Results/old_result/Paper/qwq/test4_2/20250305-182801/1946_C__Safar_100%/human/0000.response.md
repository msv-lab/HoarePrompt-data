Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a tree with n vertices, and I need to remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that each of the resulting connected components has at least x vertices. My task is to find the maximum possible x that allows me to do this.

First, I need to understand what a tree is in graph theory terms. A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles and n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. That means any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.

The problem is asking for the largest x such that after removing exactly k edges, all resulting connected components have at least x vertices. So, I need to ensure that no component is smaller than x after the removal.

Let's think about the constraints. The number of test cases is up to 10^4, and for each test case, n can be up to 10^5, with the sum of n across all test cases not exceeding 10^5. That tells me that the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n) per test case or better.

Looking at the sample input and output, I see that for n=5 and k=1, the answer is 2. In the explanation, they remove the edge between 1 and 3, resulting in two components: one with vertices 1 and 2, and another with vertices 3, 4, and 5. Both have at least 2 vertices, and it's not possible to achieve x=3 in this case.

Another sample input is n=2 and k=1, with output 1. Removing the only edge results in two components, each with 1 vertex, which meets the minimum size of 1.

For n=6 and k=1, the output is 3. If I remove one edge, I should get two components, each with at least 3 vertices.

Wait a minute, in the first sample, n=5 and k=1, x=2; in the second, n=2 and k=1, x=1; third, n=6 and k=1, x=3. It seems like x is related to n and k in some way.

I need to find a general approach to determine the maximum x for any given n and k.

Let me consider the properties of a tree. Since it's a tree, removing any edge will increase the number of connected components by exactly one. So, removing k edges will result in k+1 connected components.

I need each of these k+1 components to have at least x vertices. Therefore, the total number of vertices should be at least x*(k+1). That gives me a lower bound for x: x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

But is this always achievable? In the first sample, n=5, k=1, so x <= 5/2 = 2, which matches the sample output. In the second sample, n=2, k=1, x <= 2/2 =1, which also matches. In the third sample, n=6, k=1, x <= 6/2=3, which matches.

So, it seems that x = floor(n / (k+1)) is achievable. But I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, so k+1 <= n.

Also, in the sample inputs, this formula seems to hold.

But I need to make sure that it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to use a binary search on x. I can binary search for the largest x such that it's possible to remove k edges and have all components have at least x vertices.

To check for a particular x, I need to verify if I can remove k edges and have all resulting components have at least x vertices.

How can I efficiently check this for a given x?

I recall that in trees, we can perform DFS and keep track of the sizes of subtrees.

Let me consider performing a DFS on the tree and compute the size of each subtree.

Then, I can decide which edges to remove based on these sizes.

I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

One idea is to remove edges that, when removed, split the tree into components where each component has at least x vertices.

But how do I decide which edges to remove?

Maybe I can think in terms of heavy-light decompositions or something similar, but that might be too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as partitioning the tree into k+1 subtrees, each with at least x vertices, by removing k edges.

This sounds similar to finding a way to split the tree into k+1 parts, each of size at least x, by removing k edges.

To maximize x, I need to make the parts as large as possible, which suggests that I should try to make the parts as balanced as possible in terms of size.

But since it's a tree, the sizes might not be perfectly balanced, so I need a way to find the optimal x.

Binary search seems like a good approach here.

I can set low = 1 and high = n // (k+1), since x cannot be larger than n/(k+1).

Then, for each candidate x, I need to check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

How do I perform this check efficiently?

I need an efficient way to count the number of edges I need to remove to partition the tree into components of at least x vertices.

I recall that in trees, we can use DFS to traverse the tree and keep track of subtree sizes.

Let me consider performing a DFS from the root and keep track of the size of each subtree.

Then, I can decide which edges to remove based on these sizes.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the tree and count the number of components that have at least x vertices.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, so I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as removing edges that connect components that are smaller than x.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform a DFS from a root and compute the size of each subtree.

Then, I can consider removing edges that connect a parent node to a child node if the child's subtree size is at least x.

In that case, removing that edge would separate the child's subtree into its own component.

But I need to ensure that the remaining tree also has at least x vertices.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove edges in such a way that both resulting components have at least x vertices.

But that might not be sufficient, because after removing multiple edges, I need all resulting components to have at least x vertices.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

In the code, there's a function func_1 that takes n, k, and edges as input.

It seems to be setting up a graph representation of the tree.

Then, it performs a binary search on x, with low =1 and high = n//k.

Wait, n//k, but earlier I thought high should be n//(k+1), since removing k edges results in k+1 components.

Wait, in the code, it's r = n//k, but according to my earlier reasoning, shouldn't it be n//(k+1)?

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Let me verify with the sample input.

In the first sample, n=5, k=1, so n//(k+1)=5//2=2, which matches the sample output of 2.

But according to the code, r = n//k =5//1=5, which is higher than what's achievable.

Wait, that suggests that the code might have a mistake.

In the second sample, n=2, k=1, n//k=2//1=2, but the sample output is 1.

According to my earlier reasoning, x should be floor(n/(k+1))= floor(2/2)=1, which matches the sample.

But in the code, r= n//k=2//1=2, which is higher than the achievable x.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Let me look at the check function.

In the check function, there's a DFS-like traversal using a stack.

It's keeping track of subtree sizes and counting the number of components with size at least A (which is the current x being tested).

It seems to be counting the number of components that have size at least A, and if the number of such components is less than or equal to k, and the remaining tree has size at least A, then it returns True.

Wait, I need to understand the check function more carefully.

Let's read the check function.

It initializes a stack with the root node, performs a DFS, keeps track of subtree sizes, and counts the number of subtrees with size at least A.

If the count is greater than k or (the remaining tree has size at least A and count equals k), it returns True.

Wait, this seems a bit confusing.

Let me try to understand what the check function is doing.

It starts a DFS from node 1, keeping track of parent nodes.

For each node, it calculates the subtree size including itself.

If a node's subtree size is at least A, it's considered as a separate component, and the counter r is incremented.

If the subtree size is less than A, its size is added to the parent's subtree size.

Finally, it checks if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k), then returns True.

Wait, d[1] is the size of the remaining tree after removing the components with size at least A.

I think the logic is to count how many components have size at least A, and see if the number of such components is less than or equal to k, and the remaining tree also has size at least A.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can use the idea that to have all components with at least x vertices after removing k edges, the number of components should be at most n/x.

But since removing k edges creates k+1 components, we need k+1 <= n/x.

So, x <= n/(k+1), which aligns with my earlier thought.

But in the code, r = n//k, which is different.

Wait, maybe there's a different approach.

Let me consider that after removing k edges, there are k+1 components.

Each component must have at least x vertices, so the total number of vertices is at least x*(k+1).

Therefore, x <= floor(n/(k+1)).

So, the maximum possible x is floor(n/(k+1)).

But in the code, r = n//k, which is higher than n/(k+1).

That suggests that the code might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Let me check with the sample input.

In the first sample, n=5, k=1.

According to my calculation, x <= 5//2=2, which matches the sample output of 2.

But according to the code, r=5//1=5.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back at the code:

In func_1, it sets l=1, r=n//k.

But in my earlier reasoning, it should be r=n//(k+1).

Wait, perhaps the code has a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me look at the binary search in func_1.

It performs a binary search between l=1 and r=n//k.

Then, in the check function, it seems to be counting the number of components with size at least A.

If the number of such components is greater than k, or if the remaining tree has size at least A and the number of components equals k, it returns True.

Wait, perhaps the logic is to find the largest A such that the number of components with size at least A is at most k, and the remaining tree has size at least A.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think of an alternative approach.

Given that removing k edges results in k+1 components, and I need each component to have at least x vertices.

So, the total number of vertices in these k+1 components should be n.

Therefore, x*(k+1) <= n.

Hence, x <= floor(n/(k+1)).

So, the maximum possible x is floor(n/(k+1)).

But is this always achievable?

In the first sample, x=2, which is floor(5/2)=2, and it's achievable by removing the edge between 1 and 3, resulting in components of size 2 and 3.

In the second sample, x=1, which is floor(2/2)=1, achievable by removing the only edge, resulting in two components of size 1.

In the third sample, x=3, which is floor(6/2)=3, achievable by removing one edge to split into components of size 3 and 3.

Seems consistent.

So, it seems that x = floor(n/(k+1)) is the correct answer.

But in the code, it sets r = n//k, which for n=5, k=1 would be 5//1=5, which is higher than the achievable x=2.

That suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps in Python, 5//1 is 5, but floor(5/2)=2.

Wait, no, 5//2 is 2 in Python.

But in the code, r = n//k, which for n=5, k=1 is 5.

Then, in the binary search, it sets l=1, r=5.

Then, it performs the binary search, checking for each A whether it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least A vertices.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should set r = n//(k+1).

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to interpret this.

Let me consider that after removing k edges, there are k+1 components.

I need to ensure that each component has at least x vertices.

So, the total number of vertices in these components is n.

Therefore, x*(k+1) <= n.

Hence, x <= floor(n/(k+1)).

So, the maximum possible x is floor(n/(k+1)).

Therefore, in the code, r should be set to n//(k+1).

But in the code, it's set to n//k.

That suggests a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something.

Let me look at the check function more carefully.

In the check function, it performs a DFS, keeping track of subtree sizes.

It counts the number of subtrees with size at least A.

If the number of such subtrees is greater than k, or if the number is equal to k and the remaining tree has size at least A, then it returns True.

Otherwise, it returns False.

Wait, perhaps the logic is to count the number of components that are at least A, and see if that count is less than or equal to k, meaning we can remove k edges to separate them.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I set x = floor(n/(k+1)).

Then, I need to remove k edges such that each of the k+1 components has at least x vertices.

This seems straightforward.

So, in the binary search, I should be searching for the largest x where the number of components with size at least x is less than or equal to k, and the remaining component has size at least x.

Wait, that seems a bit tangled.

Let me try to rephrase.

In the binary search:

- For a given x, I need to check if I can remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

- If I can, then try a larger x.

- If I can't, then try a smaller x.

So, in the check function, I need to verify if, by removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

To do this, I can compute the number of components that have at least x vertices.

If the number of such components is less than or equal to k, and the remaining component has at least x vertices, then it's possible.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me think.

If I have p components with size at least x, then I need to remove p-1 edges to separate them.

But I have to remove exactly k edges.

So, this seems inconsistent.

I need to rethink this approach.

Maybe I should consider that removing an edge separates a component.

So, to have c components, I need to remove c-1 edges.

Given that I remove k edges, I will have k+1 components.

Each of these k+1 components must have at least x vertices.

Therefore, x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

So, the maximum x is floor(n / (k+1)).

Hence, I can set r = floor(n / (k+1)) and perform a binary search between 1 and r.

Wait, but in the code, r = n//k, which is different.

That suggests that the code might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct and I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me look at the sample inputs again.

First sample: n=5, k=1.

According to my calculation, x <= 5//2=2, which matches the sample output of 2.

In the code, r=5//1=5.

Then, in the binary search, it will check x from 1 to 5.

For x=5, n=5, k=1.

Can I remove 1 edge such that all components have at least 5 vertices?

No, because after removing one edge, I get two components, one with less than 5 vertices.

So, x=5 is not achievable.

x=4: same issue.

x=3: can I remove one edge to get components with at least 3 vertices?

In the first sample, removing the edge between 1 and 3 gives components of size 2 and 3.

2 < 3, so x=3 is not achievable.

But according to the code, r=5//1=5, and the binary search will check x=5,4,3,2,1.

But according to the sample, x=2 is achievable, but x=3 is not.

So, the correct answer should be x=2.

But if the code sets r=5, and the binary search finds r=2, that matches the sample.

Wait, but how does the check function work for x=2 and x=3?

I need to understand the check function.

In the check function, it performs a DFS, keeping track of subtree sizes.

For x=2:

It counts the number of subtrees with size at least 2.

If that count is greater than k, or if the count equals k and the remaining tree has size at least x, then it returns True.

In the first sample, for x=2, k=1.

Suppose the DFS traversal order is 1,2,3,4,5.

Starting from node 1:

- Subtree sizes:

- Node 1: 5

- Node 2: 1

- Node 3: 3

- Node 4:1

- Node 5:1

In the check function, it seems to count the number of subtrees with size at least A.

In this case, for A=2:

- Node 1: subtree size 5 >=2

- Node 3: subtree size 3 >=2

- Nodes 2,4,5 have subtree size 1 <2

So, r=2 (count of subtrees with size >=2)

Now, check if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k)

Here, r=2 > k=1, so it returns True.

Which is correct, since x=2 is achievable.

For x=3:

A=3

- Node 1: subtree size 5 >=3

- Node 3: subtree size 3 >=3

- r=2

- r > k=1, so returns True.

But according to the sample, x=3 is not achievable.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

In the sample, x=3 is not achievable, but according to the check function, it returns True.

That suggests that the check function is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the check function.

Let me read the check function again.

In the check function:

- Perform a DFS, keep track of subtree sizes.

- For each node, if its subtree size >= A, count it as a separate component (r +=1)

- Else, add its subtree size to the parent's subtree size.

- Finally, check if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k)

In the case of x=3:

- r=2 (nodes 1 and 3 have subtree sizes >=3)

- r > k=1, so returns True.

But in reality, x=3 is not achievable because removing one edge cannot separate the tree into components both having at least 3 vertices.

So, the check function is flawed.

It should consider that removing k edges results in k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

But the current check function doesn't account for the number of edges removed; it just counts the number of subtrees with size >=A.

That's not sufficient.

I need to fix the check function.

Let me think of a better way to implement the check function.

Given x, I need to check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To do this, I can compute the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to achieve that all components have at least x vertices.

If this minimum number is less than or equal to k, then it's achievable.

So, in the check function, I need to compute the minimum number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices, and see if that number is <=k.

But how do I compute that efficiently?

I can perform a DFS and try to find the smallest number of edges to remove such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This sounds similar to finding a partition of the tree where each partition has at least x vertices, and the number of partitions is k+1.

But I need an efficient way to compute this.

An alternative approach is to consider the tree's diameters or centers, but that might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following:

- Perform a DFS and keep track of subtree sizes.

- For each subtree of size >=x, consider it as a separate component, which requires removing the edge connecting it to its parent.

- Count the number of such separations needed.

- If the number of edges to remove is <=k, and the remaining tree has at least x vertices, then it's achievable.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a function that, for a given x, computes the number of edges that need to be removed so that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To do this:

- Perform a DFS and for each node, compute the subtree size.

- If a subtree has size >=x, then consider separating it by removing the edge connecting it to its parent.

- Count how many such separations are needed.

- Also, ensure that the remaining tree has at least x vertices.

Wait, but in the first sample, for x=2:

- Subtrees with size >=2: node 1 (size 5) and node 3 (size 3).

- So, we need to separate node 3's subtree by removing the edge between 1 and 3.

- That's one edge removal.

- The remaining tree has node 1 with subtree size 2, which is >=2.

- So, it's achievable.

For x=3:

- Subtrees with size >=3: node 1 (size 5) and node 3 (size 3).

- So, we need to separate node 3's subtree by removing the edge between 1 and 3.

- That's one edge removal.

- The remaining tree has node 1 with subtree size 2, which is <3.

- So, it's not achievable.

Wait, but according to the check function in the code, it returns True for x=3, which is incorrect.

So, I need to adjust the check function to correctly account for the remaining tree's size.

In other words, after removing the edges corresponding to subtrees with size >=x, the remaining tree should have at least x vertices.

In the x=3 case:

- After removing the edge between 1 and 3, the remaining tree has node 1 with subtree size 2, which is <3.

- Hence, it's not achievable.

So, the check function should return False for x=3.

But in the code, it returns True, which is a mistake.

Therefore, the check function needs to be modified to ensure that the remaining tree has at least x vertices.

Let me adjust the check function accordingly.

Here's the revised plan:

- Perform a DFS to compute subtree sizes.

- Count the number of subtrees with size >=x (these will be separated by removing the edge connecting them to their parent).

- Let r be this count.

- The remaining tree will have size equal to the root's subtree size minus the sum of sizes of the separated subtrees.

- If r <=k and the remaining tree's size >=x, then it's achievable.

Wait, but in the x=3 case:

- r=2 (nodes 1 and 3 have subtree sizes >=3)

- But removing r=2 edges would result in three components: node 3's subtree (size 3), node 1's remaining subtree (size 2), and possibly another component.

Wait, actually, removing r=2 edges would separate node 3's subtree and another subtree, but in this case, node 1's remaining subtree has size 2, which is <3.

Hence, it's not achievable.

But according to the above plan, r=2 >k=1, so r >k, which would return True, but it's not achievable.

So, I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be r <=k and the remaining tree's size >=x.

In the x=3 case:

- r=2 >k=1, so it's not achievable.

- But according to the condition r <=k and remaining tree's size >=x, it's False.

Hence, it's correct.

In the x=2 case:

- r=2 >k=1, but according to the condition r <=k and remaining tree's size >=x, it's False.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that removing r edges separates r+1 components.

But I have to remove exactly k edges.

So, I need r <=k, and the remaining tree's size >=x.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I need to set r to be the number of components that need to be separated, which is the number of subtrees with size >=x.

Then, the number of edges to remove is r.

So, if r <=k, and the remaining tree has size >=x, then it's achievable.

In the x=2 case:

- r=2, which is >k=1, so it's not achievable according to this condition.

But in reality, for x=2, it's achievable by removing one edge.

Wait, there's confusion here.

I need to reconcile this.

Let me try to think again.

If I set r to be the number of subtrees with size >=x, then removing r edges would separate these subtrees into their own components.

But in reality, removing one edge can separate one subtree.

So, to separate r subtrees, I need to remove r edges.

But in the x=2 case, r=2, but removing one edge can separate one subtree, and the remaining tree might have size >=x.

Wait, it's getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of edges required to separate the tree into components where each has at least x vertices.

This minimal number should be less than or equal to k for x to be achievable.

To find this minimal number, I can perform a DFS and count the number of subtrees with size >=x, and the remaining tree should have size >=x.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate the DFS and accumulate the subtree sizes.

Here's an alternative approach for the check function:

- Perform a DFS and keep track of subtree sizes.

- For each subtree with size >=x, consider it as a separate component and remove the edge connecting it to its parent.

- Keep track of the number of such separations (edges removed).

- After removing these edges, check if the remaining tree has size >=x.

- If the number of edges removed is <=k and the remaining tree has size >=x, then it's achievable.

In the x=2 case:

- Subtrees with size >=2: node 1 (size 5) and node 3 (size 3).

- Removing the edge between 1 and 3 (one edge), resulting in two components: size 3 and size 2.

- The remaining tree (after removing one subtree) has size 2, which is >=2.

- So, it's achievable.

In the x=3 case:

- Subtrees with size >=3: node 1 (size 5) and node 3 (size 3).

- Removing the edge between 1 and 3 (one edge), resulting in two components: size 3 and size 2.

- The remaining tree has size 2, which is <3.

- So, it's not achievable.

Hence, the condition should be:

- Number of edges removed (r) <=k

- And the remaining tree's size >=x

In the x=2 case:

- r=1 <=k=1, and remaining tree size=2 >=2 → achievable

In the x=3 case:

- r=1 <=k=1, but remaining tree size=2 <3 → not achievable

Wait, but in the x=3 case, r=1, remaining tree size=2 <3 → not achievable

In the x=2 case, r=1, remaining tree size=2 >=2 → achievable

So, this seems correct.

But in the initial check function, it seems to count r as the number of subtrees with size >=A, which in the x=3 case would be r=2, which is >k=1, so it would return True, which is incorrect.

Hence, the check function needs to be adjusted.

I need to modify the check function to set r as the number of subtrees with size >=A, and ensure that r <=k and the remaining tree's size >=x.

Wait, in the x=2 case, r=2 >k=1, which would make it not achievable, but it is achievable.

Wait, there's confusion here.

Wait, perhaps I need to set r as the number of edges to remove to separate subtrees with size >=x.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me try a different approach.

I recall that in trees, the number of edges to remove to get c components is c-1.

So, if I want k+1 components, I need to remove k edges.

Each of these k+1 components must have at least x vertices, where x is the minimal size.

So, the minimal x is such that n - x*(k+1) <=0, meaning x >= ceil(n/(k+1)).

But we need the maximal x, so x <= floor(n/(k+1)).

Hence, the maximal x is floor(n/(k+1)).

So, perhaps I can set r = floor(n/(k+1)) and perform a binary search between 1 and r.

But earlier, in the sample input, for n=5, k=1, x=2 which is floor(5/2)=2.

For n=6, k=1, x=3 which is floor(6/2)=3.

For n=2, k=1, x=1 which is floor(2/2)=1.

So, it seems consistent.

Hence, the maximum x is floor(n/(k+1)).

Therefore, I can compute x = floor(n/(k+1)) and output it directly.

But let's confirm with another sample.

In the fourth sample, n=3, k=1, output=1.

floor(3/2)=1, which matches.

Fifth sample, n=8, k=2, output=1.

floor(8/3)=2, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the fifth sample, n=8, k=2, x=1.

According to my formula, floor(8/3)=2, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.

Looking back, in the fifth sample, n=8, k=2, output=1.

But floor(8/3)=2, but according to the sample, x=1.

Wait, perhaps x=2 is achievable.

If I remove two edges, I can have three components, each with at least x=1 vertices.

But the sample output is 1, suggesting that x=2 is not achievable.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize x such that after removing exactly k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

So, in the n=8, k=2 case, x=1 is achievable by removing any two edges, resulting in components with at least one vertex each.

But x=2 might not be achievable depending on the tree structure.

Hence, my earlier formula floor(n/(k+1)) might not always hold.

I need to consider the tree structure.

Therefore, I need an approach that considers the tree's structure.

Let me consider that for a given x, I need to find the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

To do this, I can perform a DFS and try to merge small subtrees.

But this seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to use binary search on x and, for each x, check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

To implement the check function efficiently, I need to:

- Perform a DFS to compute subtree sizes.

- Count the number of subtrees with size >=x.

- The number of edges to remove is the number of such subtrees.

- Ensure that the remaining tree has size >=x.

Wait, in the n=8, k=2 case:

- If x=2, suppose r=number of subtrees with size >=2.

- If r <=k and remaining tree size >=x, then it's achievable.

But according to the sample, x=1 is the answer, so x=2 might not be achievable.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose the tree is a straight line: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8.

If x=2, k=2.

I can remove edges between 1-2 and 3-4, resulting in components: 1,2; 3,4; 5,6,7,8.

But 5,6,7,8 is larger than x=2.

Wait, but I removed two edges, resulting in three components.

Each has at least two vertices.

So, x=2 should be achievable.

But according to the sample, x=1 is the answer.

Wait, perhaps the tree structure affects it.

Looking back at the fifth sample input:

8 2

1 2

1 3

2 4

2 5

3 6

3 7

3 8

So, the tree is:

1

├─2

│ ├─4

│ └─5

└─3

├─6

├─7

└─8

If I remove edges 1-2 and 1-3, I get three components: 1, 2-4-5, and 3-6-7-8, each with at least x=2 vertices.

So, x=2 should be achievable.

But according to the sample, x=1 is the answer.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

6

5 1

1 2

1 3

3 4

3 5

2 1

1 2

6 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5 6

3 1

1 2

1 3

8 2

1 2

1 3

2 4

2 5

3 6

3 7

3 8

6 2

1 2

2 3

1 4

4 5

5 6

And the output is:

2

1

3

1

1

2

So, for n=8, k=2, output=1.

But according to my earlier reasoning, x=2 should be achievable.

Perhaps the tree structure affects the achievable x.

Looking at the fifth sample's tree:

1

├─2

│ ├─4

│ └─5

└─3

├─6

├─7

└─8

If I remove edges 1-2 and 1-3, I get three components: 1, 2-4-5, and 3-6-7-8, each with sizes 1,3,4.

But 1 <2, so x=2 is not achievable.

Wait, that matches the sample output of 1.

So, in this case, x=2 is not achievable because one component has size 1.

Hence, x=1 is the maximum achievable x.

So, in the check function, for x=2, it should return False, and for x=1, it should return True.

Hence, the binary search should find the maximum x where the check function returns True.

Given this, I need to ensure that the check function correctly identifies whether it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

From this example, I need to adjust the check function accordingly.

Let me try to implement the check function properly.

Here's the plan:

- Perform a DFS to compute subtree sizes.

- Count the number of subtrees with size >=x.

- The number of edges to remove is the number of such subtrees.

- Ensure that after removing these edges, the remaining tree has size >=x.

Hence, in the check function:

- If the number of subtrees with size >=x is <=k, and the remaining tree's size >=x, then it's achievable.

In the n=8, k=2, x=2 case:

- Number of subtrees with size >=2 is, say, r.

- Remove r edges.

- Check if r <=k and remaining tree's size >=x.

In the earlier example, r=2 (subtrees with size >=2), k=2, remaining tree's size=1 <2 → not achievable.

Hence, x=2 is not achievable.

For x=1:

- r= number of subtrees with size >=1, which is all subtrees.

- But in this case, r would be the number of leaves or something, but it's complicated.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink this.

Let me consider that for x=1, any removal of k edges will result in components with at least 1 vertex, which is always true.

Hence, x=1 is always achievable.

For higher x, it depends on the tree structure.

Hence, the maximum x is the minimal x such that it's achievable.

Wait, no, I need the maximal x.

Given that, I need to find the maximal x where it's possible to remove k edges and have all components with at least x vertices.

Given the sample input, for n=8, k=2, x=1 is achievable, but x=2 is not always achievable depending on the tree structure.

Hence, the answer is 1.

So, in the check function, I need to accurately count the number of edges to remove and check the remaining tree's size.

I think the initial approach in the code is flawed, and I need to fix it.

Let me try to implement a corrected check function.

Define check(A):

- Perform a DFS to compute subtree sizes.

- Count the number of subtrees with size >=A.

- This count is the number of edges to remove.

- If the number of edges to remove <=k, and the remaining tree's size >=A, then return True.

- Else, return False.

In code:

def check(A):

    # Perform DFS to compute subtree sizes

    subtree_size = [0] * (n+1)

    def dfs(node, parent):

        subtree_size[node] = 1

        for child in g[node]:

            if child != parent:

                subtree_size[node] += dfs(child, node)

        return subtree_size[node]

    dfs(1, 0)

    # Count the number of subtrees with size >=A

    r = 0

    for i in range(1, n+1):

        if subtree_size[i] >= A:

            r +=1

    # The remaining tree's size is subtree_size[1] - sum of sizes of separated subtrees

    # But subtree_size[1] is n, since it's the root.

    # So, remaining tree's size = n - sum of sizes of separated subtrees.

    # But sum of sizes of separated subtrees is sum of sizes of subtrees with size >=A.

    # Wait, no.

    # Actually, when we separate a subtree, we remove the edge connecting it to its parent.

    # So, the remaining tree is the root's subtree minus the separated subtrees.

    # It's recursive.

    # This seems too involved.

    # Perhaps a better way is to consider that removing r edges separates r subtrees,

    # and the remaining tree is the root's subtree minus these r subtrees.

    # Hence, remaining tree's size = subtree_size[1] - sum of sizes of separated subtrees.

    separated_size = sum(subtree_size[i] for i in range(1, n+1) if subtree_size[i] >=A)

    remaining_size = subtree_size[1] - separated_size

    # If r <=k and remaining_size >=A, then return True

    if r <=k and remaining_size >=A:

        return True

    return False

In the n=8, k=2, x=2 case:

- Suppose r= number of subtrees with size >=2.

- separated_size = sum of sizes of subtrees with size >=2.

- remaining_size = n - separated_size.

- Check if r <=k and remaining_size >=2.

In the earlier example, r=2, separated_size=3+4=7, remaining_size=8-7=1 <2 → not achievable.

For x=1:

- r= number of subtrees with size >=1, which is all nodes.

- r=8.

- separated_size=sum of all subtree sizes, which is 8.

- remaining_size=0.

- But according to the condition, r <=k=2 is False.

- So, it returns False.

Wait, but x=1 should be achievable.

Wait, perhaps my approach is still incorrect.

I need to rethink this.

Let me look at the problem differently.

I need to remove exactly k edges such that each of the resulting k+1 components has at least x vertices.

To maximize x, I need to make the components as large as possible.

This suggests that I should remove edges that separate the smallest possible subtrees.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove edges that connect subtrees with minimal sizes greater than or equal to x.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure that all components have at least x vertices.

This minimal number should be less than or equal to k for x to be achievable.

Hence, in the check function, I need to compute the minimal number of
