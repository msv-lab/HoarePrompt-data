Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly X, where X can be up to 10^18. That's a really big number, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence where elements are strictly increasing, and they maintain their relative order in the array. Also, even empty subsequences are considered increasing. That's important to note.

So, for a given array, how do I calculate the number of increasing subsequences? Well, for each possible subsequence, I need to check if it's strictly increasing. But with X up to 10^18, it's clear that I can't generate all possible subsequences and count them directly; that would be way too slow.

I recall that the total number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the lengths of its increasing subsequences. Maybe there's a formula or a way to construct an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

Let me think about simple cases first. If the array is empty, it has only one increasing subsequence: the empty one. But the problem allows arrays with at least one element, since X starts from 2.

For an array of length 1, say [0], it has two increasing subsequences: the empty one and the one containing the single element. So, for any array of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is at least n+1 (for an array where all elements are in strictly increasing order).

Wait, is that always true? Let's see: for an array with all elements equal, like [1,1,1], the only increasing subsequences are the empty one and the single-element ones, so it's n+1. But for strictly increasing arrays, like [1,2,3], every subset is an increasing subsequence, so the total number is 2^n.

So, the number of increasing subsequences ranges from n+1 (for non-increasing arrays) to 2^n (for strictly increasing arrays).

But in this problem, X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60. So, for n=60, 2^n is about 10^18. That suggests that n can be up to around 60 to reach X=10^18.

But the problem allows arrays of length up to 200, which is more than enough since 2^60 is sufficient for X=10^18.

So, one straightforward approach is to create an array that is strictly increasing, with n elements, where 2^n is equal to X. But X can be any value up to 10^18, not necessarily a power of 2.

Hmm, so I need a way to construct an array where the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Let me think about how to combine different parts of the array to get the desired X.

I recall that the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum over all k from 0 to n of the number of strictly increasing subsequences of length k.

But that seems too general. Maybe I can think in terms of binary representations.

Since 2^n gives the total number of subsets for a strictly increasing array, maybe I can represent X in binary and construct the array accordingly.

Let's consider X in binary. Each bit in X's binary representation can correspond to including or excluding certain subsequences.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the minimal array that can achieve X increasing subsequences.

Let me consider building the array step by step, adding elements in a way that allows me to reach exactly X increasing subsequences.

First, I need a way to calculate the number of increasing subsequences for a given array. Maybe I can use dynamic programming for that.

Let's define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending with the i-th element.

Then, dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j] for all j < i where a[j] < a[i])

The total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of dp[i] for all i, plus one for the empty subsequence.

But again, this seems too slow for large X.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the problem in terms of binary representations.

Suppose I have an array that is strictly increasing up to a certain point, and then some elements that don't affect the strictly increasing property.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that an array with all elements equal has n+1 increasing subsequences, and an array that is strictly increasing has 2^n increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps I can mix these properties to reach any X between n+1 and 2^n.

Let me consider an array where the first k elements are strictly increasing, and the remaining elements are equal to the k-th element.

In that case, the number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of subsets of the first k elements (which is 2^k - 1, excluding the empty set), plus the subsequences that include elements from the remaining part.

Wait, maybe that's not the best way.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that for an array that is strictly increasing up to some point, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^k, where k is the length of that increasing part.

If I have an array like [1,2,3], it has 2^3 = 8 increasing subsequences (including the empty one).

If I add another element equal to one of the existing ones, say [1,2,3,3], then the new element can only be added to subsequences that don't already contain 3.

Wait, but in this case, the number of increasing subsequences would be 2^3 + 2^2 = 8 + 4 = 12, because the new 3 can be added to subsequences that end with 2 or less.

Wait, actually, no. If I have [1,2,3,3], then the total number of increasing subsequences is:

- Subsequences not including the last 3: 2^3 = 8

- Subsequences including the last 3: they must be appended to subsequences that end with a number less than 3, which are subsequences ending with 1 or 2.

- The number of such subsequences is dp[1] + dp[2], where dp[i] is the number of increasing subsequences ending with the i-th element.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the minimal array length needed to achieve X increasing subsequences.

Since for a strictly increasing array of length n, there are 2^n increasing subsequences (including the empty one).

So, if X is a power of 2, say X = 2^n, then I can just create a strictly increasing array of length n.

But X can be any integer between 2 and 10^18, not necessarily a power of 2.

So, maybe I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2.

Wait, but X includes the empty subsequence, so I need to consider that.

Actually, total increasing subsequences = sum over all non-empty increasing subsequences + 1 for the empty subsequence.

So, if I have a strictly increasing array of length n, total increasing subsequences = 2^n.

If I have an array that is not strictly increasing, the total number of increasing subsequences is less than 2^n.

So, perhaps I can decompose X into a sum of powers of 2, and construct corresponding array parts for each power.

Wait, but X includes the empty subsequence, so maybe I should consider X - 1 as the sum of non-empty increasing subsequences.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have an array where the first k elements are strictly increasing, and the remaining elements are less than or equal to the k-th element.

Then, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^k + something.

Wait, perhaps I can use the inclusion of elements after the k-th one in a way that adds specific numbers to the total count.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that in binary representation, any number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

Similarly, maybe I can construct the array by combining parts, each contributing a power of 2 to the total number of increasing subsequences.

For example, if I have parts that contribute 2^a, 2^b, ..., then the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of these contributions.

But I need to make sure that these contributions don't overlap in a way that affects the total count.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the contributions are additive.

So, if I can create disjoint sets of increasing subsequences, each set corresponding to a power of 2, then the total would be the sum of these powers.

To achieve this, perhaps I can create segments in the array where each segment contributes a specific power of 2 to the total count.

For instance, have segments that are strictly increasing, and their lengths correspond to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of X.

Wait, but I need to be careful with how these segments interact.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let X - 1 be represented in binary as a sum of distinct powers of 2: X - 1 = 2^{a1} + 2^{a2} + ... + 2^{ak}.

Then, the total number of non-empty increasing subsequences is X - 1.

I need to construct an array where the number of non-empty increasing subsequences is X - 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with an array that has a certain number of increasing subsequences.

- Add elements to the array in a way that increases the number of increasing subsequences by a known amount.

- Continue this process until the total number of increasing subsequences reaches X.

But I need a more systematic way.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have an array of length n, and I want to add an element to it.

How does the number of increasing subsequences change?

If I add an element that is larger than all existing elements, then it can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences, doubling the number of increasing subsequences (since for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or exclude the new element).

Wait, but that includes the empty subsequence, which remains the same.

Actually, for strictly increasing arrays, adding a new largest element does indeed double the number of increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

So, starting with an empty array (1 subsequence), adding a smaller element gives 2 subsequences (empty and the single element), adding a larger element gives 4 subsequences, and so on.

But in general, adding an element that is not larger than all previous elements will not double the number of increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of multiplying the current number of increasing subsequences by 2 when adding a new largest element.

This suggests that to reach X=2^n, I can have a strictly increasing array of length n.

But again, X is not necessarily a power of 2.

So, maybe I can represent X in binary, and construct corresponding segments in the array that contribute 2^a, 2^b, etc., to the total count.

But I need to ensure that these contributions are additive.

Wait, perhaps I can have separate increasing segments in the array that don't interfere with each other.

For example, if I have disjoint increasing subsequences, their contributions might be additive.

Wait, but in reality, since subsequences can include elements from different segments, their contributions may not be purely additive.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to look for a different perspective.

Suppose I fix the length of the array, n, and try to maximize or minimize the number of increasing subsequences.

As I saw earlier, for a strictly increasing array, it's 2^n, and for a non-increasing array, it's n+1.

But again, I need a way to hit exactly X.

Maybe I can think of the array as consisting of several strictly increasing segments, and calculate the total number of increasing subsequences based on these segments.

Wait, perhaps I can model the array as a sequence of increasing runs, and compute the total number of increasing subsequences accordingly.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider small values of X and see what arrays would correspond to them.

For X=2:

- The smallest array is of length 1, say [0], which has two increasing subsequences: empty and [0].

So, for X=2, array of length 1 suffices.

For X=3:

- If I have an array of length 2, say [0,1], which is strictly increasing, it has 4 increasing subsequences: empty, [0], [1], [0,1].

But I need only 3.

- Maybe [0,0], which has three increasing subsequences: empty, [0], [0].

Wait, no, according to the problem, different positions count as different subsequences, even if their values are the same.

So, [0,0] has three increasing subsequences: empty, [0] (first position), and [0] (second position).

Perfect, that works for X=3.

Wait, but in the sample input, for X=2, the output is an array of length 1, and for X=5, it's an array of length 3.

Let me check X=5.

Sample input for X=5 is:

3

0 1 0

Let's see: what are the increasing subsequences here?

- Empty

- [0] (first position)

- [1]

- [0] (third position)

- [0,1]

So, total of 5 increasing subsequences.

Yes, that matches.

Another sample for X=13:

5

2 2 3 4 2

Increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [2] (first)

- [2] (second)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2] (fifth)

- [2,3]

- [2,4]

- [2,3,4]

- [2,4]

- [2,3]

- [2,4]

- [2,3,4]

Wait, I'm getting more than 13 here. Maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps I need a better way to count them.

Let me list all possible increasing subsequences:

1. Empty

2. [2] (first)

3. [2] (second)

4. [3]

5. [4]

6. [2] (fifth)

7. [2,3]

8. [2,4]

9. [3,4]

10. [2,3,4]

11. [2,4] (from second 2 and 4)

12. [2,3] (from second 2 and 3)

13. [2,3,4] (from second 2, 3, and 4)

So, indeed, 13 subsequences.

Okay, this seems to work.

So, perhaps the approach is to build the array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences adds up to X.

But how to generalize this?

Looking back, for X=2, use length 1.

For X=3, use two equal elements.

For X=5, use [0,1,0], which has increasing subsequences as above.

For X=13, use [2,2,3,4,2], which also fits.

I need to find a pattern here.

Perhaps, I can represent X in binary, and for each set bit in X, add a corresponding structure to the array.

Wait, but I need to think about how to decompose X into a sum of values that correspond to certain array structures.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of building the array incrementally, adding elements in a way that increases the total number of increasing subsequences by a specific amount.

Let me consider starting with an empty array, which has one increasing subsequence (the empty one).

Then, adding an element increases the total to 2 (empty and the single element).

Adding another element that is larger than the first increases the total to 4 (empty, first element, second element, and the pair).

Adding another element that is larger than the second increases the total to 8, and so on.

But if I add an element that is not larger than the previous ones, it only adds its own single-element subsequence.

For example, adding an element equal to the previous one adds one to the total (its own single-element subsequence).

So, perhaps I can control the total number of increasing subsequences by choosing where to add larger elements or重复 elements.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote the current total number of increasing subsequences as S.

Starting with S=1 (empty array).

Adding an element larger than all previous ones:

- This new element can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences, doubling the total.

- So, S becomes 2*S.

Adding an element equal to one of the previous elements:

- This new element can only be taken as a single-element subsequence.

- So, S becomes S + 1.

Adding an element smaller than some previous elements but not equal to any:

- This is more complicated, as it can extend some subsequences but not others.

- Maybe it's better to avoid this to keep things simple.

So, with these two operations:

- Doubling S by adding a larger element.

- Incrementing S by 1 by adding an equal element.

I can try to reach X by starting from S=1 and applying these operations.

This seems similar to building X in binary, where each doubling corresponds to a shift left (multiplying by 2), and adding 1 corresponds to setting a bit to 1.

So, perhaps I can represent X-1 in binary, where each bit set to 1 corresponds to adding an equal element, and each shift left corresponds to adding a larger element.

Wait, but I need to be careful.

Let me try to see with X=5.

X=5, which is 101 in binary.

Starting with S=1.

- Add a larger element: S=2.

- Add an equal element: S=3.

- Add a larger element: S=6.

But 6 is more than 5, so this doesn't work.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the order.

Alternatively, perhaps I should target X-1, which is 4 for X=5.

So, 4 is 100 in binary.

Starting with S=1.

- Add a larger element: S=2.

- Add a larger element: S=4.

Then, the total is 4, which corresponds to X-1=4, so X=5.

But in the sample, for X=5, they used [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences.

In this approach, I would have [first element], [larger second element], [larger third element], totaling 4 increasing subsequences plus the empty one, which is 5.

Wait, but in my earlier counting, [0,1,0] has 5 increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps I can represent X-1 in binary, and for each bit set to 1, add a larger element, and for each 0, add an equal element.

Wait, no, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each time I add a larger element, it doubles the number of increasing subsequences.

Each time I add an equal element, it adds one to the total.

So, to build X, I can think of X as composed of these operations.

Let me try to represent X in terms of these operations.

Suppose I have a sequence of operations: double or add one.

Then, starting from S=1, applying these operations should lead to S=X.

This is similar to the binary representation, where each 'double' corresponds to a shift left, and 'add one' corresponds to setting a bit.

So, for X=5, which is 101 in binary:

- Start with S=1.

- Double: S=2.

- Double: S=4.

- Add one: S=5.

So, the operations are: double, double, add one.

Translating to array construction:

- Start with an empty array (S=1).

- Add a larger element (double): array becomes [a], S=2.

- Add a larger element (double): array becomes [a, b], S=4.

- Add an equal element (add one): array becomes [a, b, b], S=5.

But in the sample, for X=5, they used [0,1,0], which also gives S=5.

So, [0,1,0] can be seen as:

- Start with [0]: S=2.

- Add 1 (larger): S=4.

- Add 0 (smaller): S=5.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, adding a smaller element shouldn't simply add one.

Maybe my earlier assumption needs correction.

Alternatively, perhaps adding an element that is equal to some previous elements adds as many subsequences as the number of previous elements it can extend.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to formalize the dp approach to calculate the number of increasing subsequences.

Define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending with the i-th element.

Then, dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j] for all j < i where a[j] < a[i])

The total number of increasing subsequences is sum(dp[i]) for all i, plus one for the empty subsequence.

But this is too slow for large n and X.

I need a smarter way to construct the array.

Let me consider another approach: building the array from the largest possible contributions down to smaller ones.

Since 2^n can be too large, but I can combine smaller contributions.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation of X-1 to determine where to place equal or larger elements.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let Y = X - 1.

Represent Y in binary as Y = 2^{a1} + 2^{a2} + ... + 2^{ak}.

Then, construct an array that has segments corresponding to each 2^{ai}.

For example, for Y=5, which is 101 in binary (4 + 1), I can have two segments: one that contributes 4 and one that contributes 1.

To contribute 4, I can have a strictly increasing subarray of length 2 (since 2^2 = 4), and to contribute 1, I can add an equal element.

So, [0,1,1]: strictly increasing [0,1] contributes 4, and the additional 1 contributes 1, totaling 5.

But in the sample, they used [0,1,0], which also gives 5.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the same X.

This seems promising.

Let me try to generalize this.

Suppose Y = sum of 2^{ai}, where ai are the positions of 1s in the binary representation of Y.

Then, for each 2^{ai}, I need to add a segment to the array that contributes 2^{ai} to the total number of increasing subsequences.

To contribute 2^{ai}, I can have a strictly increasing subarray of length ai.

For example, for ai=2, a subarray of length 2 like [0,1] contributes 2^2=4.

Then, for ai=0, which is 2^0=1, I can add an element equal to the smallest existing element.

So, for Y=5=4+1, I can have [0,1,0], which gives 4 from [0,1] and 1 from the last 0.

Wait, but in reality, the total is 5, as per the sample.

So, this seems to work.

Similarly, for Y=12, which is 8+4=2^3 + 2^2, I can have a subarray of length 3 like [0,1,2] contributing 8, and a subarray of length 2 like [0,1] contributing 4, totaling 12.

But I need to make sure that the contributions don't overlap in a way that increases the total beyond the sum.

This might require careful construction to ensure that the contributions are additive.

Perhaps, to make the contributions additive, I need to ensure that the segments are constructed in a way that their increasing subsequences don't combine to create new increasing subsequences beyond the sum.

One way to do this is to have the segments be decreasing between them.

For example, have the first segment be strictly increasing, then the next segment is strictly less than the end of the previous segment, and so on.

This way, subsequences can't cross segments in a way that creates new increasing subsequences beyond the sum of each segment's contributions.

Let me try this with Y=5=4+1.

Have [0,1,-1].

- Subarrays:

- [0]: 1

- [1]: 1

- [0,1]: 1

- [-1]: 1

- [0,-1]: not increasing

- [1,-1]: not increasing

- Total: 3, plus empty: 4, which is not 5.

Wait, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, [0,1,0]:

- [0]: 2

- [1]: 1

- [0,1]: 1

- [0] (second 0): 1

- Total: 5, as in the sample.

So, in this case, it worked.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, adding an equal element should add one to the total.

In this case, adding the second 0 adds one to the total, making it 5.

So, perhaps the approach is:

- Start with a strictly increasing subarray of length k, contributing 2^k subsequences.

- Then, add elements that are equal to some previous elements, each adding one to the total.

- Ensure that no new increasing subsequences are created beyond the sum of these contributions.

This seems plausible.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let Y = X - 1 be the sum of non-empty increasing subsequences.

Represent Y in binary as Y = 2^{a1} + 2^{a2} + ... + 2^{ak}.

Then, construct the array as k segments:

- The first segment is a strictly increasing subarray of length a1, contributing 2^{a1}.

- The second segment is a strictly increasing subarray of length a2, but less than the previous segment, contributing 2^{a2}.

- And so on.

Wait, but if I have separate increasing segments that are decreasing between them, the total number of increasing subsequences should be the sum of each segment's contributions.

For example, [0,1,3,2,4], where [0,1,3] is one segment contributing 8, and [2,4] is another contributing 4, total 12.

But in reality, there are more increasing subsequences that span across segments, like [0,1,2,4], which is increasing.

So, this approach doesn't work because the contributions are not additive.

This is a problem.

I need a way to ensure that the contributions don't overlap in a way that creates additional increasing subsequences.

Perhaps, to prevent overlapping, I need to separate the segments in a way that no element from one segment can be part of an increasing subsequence with elements from another segment.

One way to do this is to ensure that all elements in one segment are less than all elements in the previous segments.

Wait, but that's what I tried earlier, and it didn't work because subsequences can span across segments.

Wait, no, if I ensure that the next segment starts with elements less than the previous segment's elements, then subsequences can't span across them in an increasing manner.

For example, [0,1,3,2,4]:

- [0,1,3]: strictly increasing, contributes 2^3 = 8.

- [2,4]: strictly increasing, contributes 2^2 = 4.

- But there are subsequences like [0,1,2,4], which is increasing and spans both segments.

So, the contributions are not additive.

Therefore, this approach won't work.

I need a different way.

Let me consider another idea: building the array in a way that each new element added contributes a specific number to the total count of increasing subsequences.

For example, adding an element that is larger than all previous elements doubles the total number of increasing subsequences.

Adding an element that is equal to a previous element increases the total by one.

Adding an element that is smaller than some previous elements but not equal to any complicates things.

Perhaps, I can limit the array to have only equal elements or strictly increasing segments separated by equal elements.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of "runs" in the array.

Define a run as a sequence of equal elements.

Then, between runs, have strictly increasing values.

For example, [0,0,1,1,2].

In this case:

- Runs: [0,0], [1,1], [2]

- The number of increasing subsequences can be calculated based on the number of choices from each run.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as choosing at most one element from each run, and the runs are ordered increasingly.

So, for [0,0,1,1,2]:

- Choose from the first run: 0 or 0 (two choices, but since they are equal, it's just one choice for the value.

- Choose from the second run: 1 or 1 (again, one choice for the value.

- Choose from the third run: 2.

- The total number of increasing subsequences is (number of choices from first run) * (number of choices from second run) * (number of choices from third run).

Wait, but this might not be accurate because you can choose to skip some runs.

Wait, actually, for each run, you can choose to take one element from it or none.

Since all elements in a run are equal, choosing any element from the run is the same.

So, for each run, you have two choices: take one element or take none.

Therefore, the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of (choices from each run).

But this includes the empty subsequence.

Wait, no, the empty subsequence is when you take none from all runs.

So, for [0,0,1,1,2]:

- Choices from first run: take 0 or none.

- Choices from second run: take 1 or none.

- Choices from third run: take 2 or none.

- Total increasing subsequences: 2 * 2 * 2 = 8, including the empty one.

But in reality, the array [0,0,1,1,2] has more than 8 increasing subsequences because you can choose different elements from the same run in different positions.

Wait, no, since elements within a run are equal, choosing different positions doesn't create new distinct subsequences in terms of values, but according to the problem, different positions count as different subsequences, even if their values are the same.

So, for [0,0,1,1,2]:

- Empty

- [0] (first 0)

- [0] (second 0)

- [1] (first 1)

- [1] (second 1)

- [2]

- [0,1] (various combinations of positions)

- [0,2]

- [1,2]

- [0,1,2]

And so on.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Therefore, the total number of increasing subsequences is more than just the product of choices from each run.

This approach seems invalid.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each run can be treated as a separate entity, and the ways they can combine to form increasing subsequences.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different strategy altogether.

Let me consider that for any array, the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over all i of the number of increasing subsequences ending at a[i].

And the number of increasing subsequences ending at a[i] is equal to the number of increasing subsequences ending at any a[j] where j < i and a[j] < a[i], plus one (for the single element subsequence [a[i]]).

This is the standard dp approach.

But again, for large n and X, this is not practical for construction.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in a strictly increasing array, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

I can think of this as each element either being included or not in the subsequence.

Similarly, in an array where some elements are equal, the number of increasing subsequences is less than 2^n, but still can be calculated based on the structure of the array.

Perhaps, I can represent X as a combination of powers of 2, each corresponding to a subset of elements in the array.

Wait, but this seems too vague.

Let me try to think in terms of binary decisions.

Each element in the array can be either included or not in a subsequence, as long as the subsequence is increasing.

In a strictly increasing array, these decisions are independent, hence 2^n.

In arrays with equal elements, some decisions are dependent.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to look for a different angle.

Suppose I fix the length of the array, n, and try to maximize or minimize the number of increasing subsequences.

As n increases, the maximum number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

The minimum is n+1 (all elements equal).

So, for a given n, I can represent any X between n+1 and 2^n.

But with n up to 200, and X up to 10^18, which is 2^60, I need a way to hit exactly X.

This seems challenging.

Wait, perhaps I can fix n to be the smallest possible to have 2^n >= X, and then adjust the array to reduce the number of increasing subsequences to exactly X.

For example, start with a strictly increasing array of length n, which has 2^n increasing subsequences, then modify some elements to reduce the total to X.

But how to do this systematically?

Let me consider that each element that is not strictly increasing reduces the total number of increasing subsequences.

But it's not clear by how much it reduces.

This seems too heuristic.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I represent X in binary, and for each bit set to 1 in X, associate it with a specific increasing subsequence.

But it's not clear how to map bits to subsequences.

This seems too abstract.

Let me consider that in a strictly increasing array of length n, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n.

If I want to have exactly X=2^n, I can just create a strictly increasing array of length n.

But X can be any number up to 2^n, not necessarily a power of 2.

So, perhaps I can remove some elements conditionally to reduce the total number of increasing subsequences.

But removing elements changes the structure of the array, which might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set some elements to be equal, thereby reducing the total number of distinct increasing subsequences.

But again, it's not clear how to control the exact number.

This is proving to be difficult.

Let me try to look back at the sample inputs and see if there's a pattern.

For X=2:

- Array: [0] -> subsequences: empty and [0]

For X=5:

- Array: [0,1,0] -> subsequences: empty, [0] (first), [1], [0] (second), [0,1]

For X=13:

- Array: [2,2,3,4,2] -> subsequences as listed earlier, totaling 13.

For X=37:

- Array: [-1,-1,0,0,2,3,-1] -> presumably gives 37 increasing subsequences.

Looking at these, it seems that using repeated elements allows controlling the total number of increasing subsequences.

Perhaps, by carefully choosing where to repeat elements, I can control the total count.

Let me consider that each time I add an element equal to a previous one, I'm adding exactly one new increasing subsequence: the subsequence consisting of just that element.

Is that accurate?

In the array [0,0], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [0] (first)

- [0] (second)

So, total of 3, which is 2^1 + 1 = 3.

Wait, 2^1 is from the strictly increasing part of length 1, and +1 from the equal element.

This seems similar to the earlier approach.

So, perhaps, for a segment of strictly increasing elements of length k, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^k.

Then, adding an equal element adds one more subsequence: the single element subsequence.

If I have multiple equal elements, each adds one.

So, for [0,0], it's 2^1 +1 = 3.

For [0,0,0], it would be 2^1 +2 = 4.

Similarly, for [0,1,0], it's 2^2 +1 = 5.

Wait, but in reality, [0,1,0] has 5 increasing subsequences, as per the sample.

Similarly, [2,2,3,4,2]:

- [2,2,3,4] is strictly increasing if we ignore duplicates.

- Wait, 2 is repeated.

- So, perhaps it's 2^4 (from [2,2,3,4]) plus some additional from the last 2.

But 2^4=16, which is more than 13, so maybe this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 2^3 (from [2,3,4]) plus 2^1 (from the two 2's).

But 8 + 2 = 10, which is not 13.

Wait, perhaps it's more complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I build the array by starting with a strictly increasing sequence of length k, which gives 2^k increasing subsequences.

Then, I add elements that are equal to some previous elements, each adding one to the total count.

So, for example, in [0,1,0]:

- [0,1]: strictly increasing, 2^2=4 subsequences.

- Add another 0: it's equal to the first 0, so adds one more subsequence.

- Total: 5.

This matches the sample.

Similarly, in [2,2,3,4,2]:

- [2,2,3,4]: strictly increasing part is [2,3,4], which gives 2^3=8 subsequences.

- Plus two equal 2's: adds two more subsequences.

- Total: 10.

But the sample says 13.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in [2,2,3,4,2], the strictly increasing part is [2,3,4], which gives 2^3=8.

Then, there are three 2's, so adding two more subsequences (one for each additional 2), totaling 10.

But the sample says 13.

So, perhaps this approach is incomplete.

Maybe there are more interactions between the equal elements and the increasing parts.

This is getting too tangled.

I need a different plan.

Let me consider that the total number of increasing subsequences is equal to the sum over all possible subsets that are strictly increasing.

I need to find an array where this sum is exactly X.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, and the array can have up to 200 elements, it's feasible, but I need an efficient way to construct such an array.

Perhaps, I can use the binary representation of X to determine the structure of the array.

Let me consider that each bit in X corresponds to including or excluding certain subsequences.

But I need a clearer connection.

Let me consider building the array incrementally, choosing each new element such that it adds a specific number of new increasing subsequences.

For example, adding a new largest element doubles the total number of increasing subsequences.

Adding an equal element adds one to the total.

Adding an element smaller than some previous elements adds some number between 1 and the number of elements it's larger than.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define:

- S: total number of increasing subsequences.

Start with S=1 (empty subsequence).

Add elements one by one, updating S based on the new element's value.

If the new element is larger than all previous elements:

- It can be appended to all existing increasing subsequences, doubling S.

- Set a new maximum value.

If the new element is equal to a previous element:

- It adds one new subsequence: the subsequence containing only this element.

- It cannot be appended to any existing increasing subsequences because it's not larger.

If the new element is smaller than some previous elements:

- It can be appended to subsequences that end with elements smaller than it.

- This would require tracking which subsequences it can extend.

This seems too complex for manual construction.

Perhaps I can limit the array to only have equal elements or strictly increasing segments, as I thought earlier.

Let me try to formalize this approach.

Construct the array as a sequence of segments, where each segment is a set of equal elements, and between segments, the elements are strictly increasing.

For example:

- [0,0,1,1,2]

In this case:

- The first segment has two 0's: contributes 2^1 +1 = 3 (from the strictly increasing part of length 1 plus one for the equal element).

- The second segment has two 1's: contributes 2^1 +1 = 3.

- The third segment has one 2: contributes 2^1 =2.

- Total: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8, but in reality, it's more due to combinations across segments.

Wait, this doesn't seem to work because subsequences can span across segments.

This is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to treat each segment as contributing independently, but that's not accurate because of the spanning subsequences.

This seems too difficult.

Let me consider a different strategy: start with a strictly increasing array of length n, which has 2^n increasing subsequences, and then modify it to reduce the total to exactly X.

For example, if X < 2^n, I can set some elements to be equal to previous elements, thereby reducing the total number of increasing subsequences.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me think about it in terms of binary representation again.

Let Y = X - 1.

I need to find a way to represent Y as a sum of distinct powers of 2, and construct the array accordingly.

Wait, but Y can be any number from 1 to 10^18 -1.

Perhaps, I can represent Y in binary, and for each bit set to 1, add a corresponding segment to the array.

For instance, for Y=5=101 in binary:

- The least significant bit (1) corresponds to adding an equal element.

- The third bit (1) corresponds to adding a strictly increasing segment of length 2.

So, starting with an empty array:

- Add a strictly increasing segment of length 2: [0,1], which gives 2^2=4 subsequences.

- Add an equal element: [0,1,0], which adds one more subsequence, totaling 5.

This matches the sample.

Similarly, for Y=12=1100 in binary:

- The second and third bits are set: 2^2 + 2^3 =4 +8=12.

- So, construct [0,1,2,3], which is strictly increasing with length 4, giving 2^4=16 subsequences.

- But I need 13, which is 16 -3.

Wait, this doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps this approach only works for sums of distinct powers of 2, but X can be any number.

I need a way to handle X that is not a sum of distinct powers of 2.

Wait, but X is any integer between 2 and 10^18, so I need a general approach.

Let me consider that for any X, I can represent it as Y +1, where Y is from 1 to 10^18 -1.

Then, represent Y in binary as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

Then, construct the array by adding segments that correspond to each power of 2 in the binary representation.

For example, for Y=5=101 in binary:

- Add a segment that contributes 4 (2^2).

- Add a segment that contributes 1 (2^0).

- Total: 5.

In terms of the array, this can be [0,1,0], as in the sample.

Similarly, for Y=12=1100 in binary:

- Add a segment that contributes 8 (2^3).

- Add a segment that contributes 4 (2^2).

- Total: 12.

This would be [0,1,2,3], which has 16 subsequences, but I need 13.

So, this approach doesn't directly
