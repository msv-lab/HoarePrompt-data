Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the array a_i. I can buy up to m tickets per day, and there's this rule that if I buy x tickets on a day, the price per ticket increases by x for all the subsequent days.

My goal is to buy exactly k tickets in total, spending the minimum amount of money possible. Okay, that sounds like an optimization problem. I need to decide how many tickets to buy on which days to minimize the total cost, considering that buying tickets on earlier days affects the prices on later days.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

- t is the number of test cases, and it can be up to 10^4.

- n can be up to 3*10^5 per test case, but the total sum of n across all test cases doesn't exceed 3*10^5.

- m can be up to 10^9, and k can be up to min(n*m, 10^9).

- The array a_i has n integers, each up to 10^9.

Given these constraints, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n log n) per test case or better, because O(n^2) would be too slow with n up to 3*10^5.

Let me think about the problem.

I have to buy k tickets, with a limit of m tickets per day, and the prices increase by the number of tickets bought each day for future days.

So, if I buy x tickets on day i, the price per ticket on day i is a_i, and for all days j > i, the price becomes a_j + x.

I need to minimize the total cost.

Hmm.

This seems like a problem that can be approached by considering the days in a certain order and deciding how many tickets to buy on each day.

But with the price increases affecting future days based on current purchases, it's a bit tricky.

Let me consider a smaller example to get some intuition.

Take the first example from the input:

4 2 3

8 6 4 2

So, n=4, m=2, k=3

Prices: 8,6,4,2

An optimal way is:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices for days 2-4 become [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices for days 3-4 become [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost = 1*4 = 4, prices for day 4 become [2 + 1 = 3]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 2*3 = 6

Total cost: 4 + 6 = 10

Another possible way:

- Buy 1 on day 1: cost = 1*8 = 8, prices for days 2-4 become [6+1=7, 4+1=5, 2+1=3]

- Buy 1 on day 2: cost = 1*7 = 7, prices for days 3-4 become [5+1=6, 3+1=4]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost = 1*6 = 6

Total cost: 8 + 7 + 6 = 21, which is worse.

So, buying later when prices are lower is better, but buying too late might increase the prices for earlier days if you buy too many later.

Wait, in the first approach, buying on day 3 and day 4 is better.

Let me see another example:

4 2 8

8 6 4 2

Only one way:

- Buy 2 on day 1: cost = 2*8 = 16, prices for days 2-4 become [6+2=8, 4+2=6, 2+2=4]

- Buy 2 on day 2: cost = 2*8 = 16, prices for days 3-4 become [6+2=8, 4+2=6]

- Buy 2 on day 3: cost = 2*8 = 16, prices for days 4 become [6+2=8]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 2*8 = 16

Total cost: 16*4 = 64

Seems like that's the only way since k=8 and m=2, so buying 2 each day.

Another example:

5 100 1

10000 1 100 10 1000

So, n=5, m=100, k=1

Prices: 10000,1,100,10,1000

An optimal way is to buy on the day with the lowest price, which is day 2 with price 1.

Total cost: 1

Makes sense.

Last example:

6 3 9

5 5 5 5 5 5

So, n=6, m=3, k=9

Prices: 5,5,5,5,5,5

Since m=3 and k=9, I can buy 3 tickets each day for 3 days.

Total cost: 3*5 + 3*5 + 3*5 = 45

But the output is 72, which is different. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, let's see.

If I buy 3 on day 1: cost = 3*5 = 15, prices for days 2-6 become [5+3=8,5+3=8,5+3=8,5+3=8,5+3=8]

Then buy 3 on day 2: cost = 3*8 = 24, prices for days 3-6 become [8+3=11,8+3=11,8+3=11,8+3=11]

Then buy 3 on day 3: cost = 3*11 = 33

Total cost: 15 + 24 + 33 = 72

Okay, that matches the sample output.

So, in this case, buying on the first three days with increasing prices due to the tickets bought earlier.

Now, I need to generalize this.

I need to find a way to choose which days to buy tickets and how many, to minimize the total cost.

Given that buying on a day increases the prices for future days, it seems beneficial to buy on days with lower original prices, but also considering that buying on later days might be better because the price increases are applied to fewer days.

Wait, maybe it's better to buy on the days with the lowest prices, but considering the impact on future days.

This seems like a problem that can be approached by sorting the days in increasing order of their prices and buying as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the constraints.

But I need to be careful because buying on a day affects the prices on all subsequent days.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the days on which I buy tickets, and then decide how many to buy on each day.

But with n up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient way.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of priority queues or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days by their base prices and decide how many tickets to buy on each in that order.

Let me consider sorting the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can consider buying as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the price increases for subsequent days.

But I need to make sure that the price increases are accounted for when buying on later days.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the price increases.

This seems complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and understand what it's doing.

The program reads t test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, m, k and the array M (which corresponds to a_i).

It sets m to be the minimum of m and k, which makes sense because you can't buy more tickets per day than m or than needed (k).

Then, it sorts the array M in ascending order.

Then, it calculates q as the ceiling of k divided by m, which is the minimum number of days needed to buy k tickets, given that you can buy up to m tickets per day.

Then, it takes the first q days with the lowest prices (since M is sorted).

Then, it checks if n*m*q equals k, but that seems off.

Wait, no, it checks if n*m equals k, but n is the number of days, m is the maximum tickets per day, and k is the total tickets to buy.

Wait, no, it's checking if n*m equals k, which would mean buying m tickets every day for n days to reach exactly k.

But in the example, n=4, m=2, k=3, which is not equal to n*m=8.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Looking back, in the code:

if n*m == k:

But in the example, n=4, m=2, k=3, which is not equal, so it goes to the else clause.

Wait, but in the code, it's n*m*q == k, but q is ceil(k/m), so n*m*ceil(k/m) == k.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand what n, m, q, and k represent here.

n is the number of days.

m is the maximum tickets per day.

k is the total tickets to buy.

q is the minimum number of days needed to buy k tickets, which is ceil(k/m).

Then, it takes the first q days with the lowest prices.

Then, if n*m*q == k, which seems unlikely in general, it calculates the cost one way, else another way.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let me try to think of the problem differently.

Suppose I decide to buy a certain number of tickets on certain days.

Each ticket bought on a day affects the prices of all subsequent days.

So, the total cost can be expressed as the sum over all tickets bought, of the price on the day they are bought, plus the increments due to previous purchases.

This seems complex to calculate directly.

Perhaps there's a way to model this as assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of choosing which days to buy tickets on, and how many, in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the price increases.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the number of tickets bought so far and the current price increment.

But with n up to 3*10^5, dynamic programming with n states would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be optimized by buying tickets on the days with the lowest prices, considering the price increments.

So, perhaps sorting the days by their base prices and buying as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, taking into account the price increments for subsequent days.

Wait, maybe I can sort the days in increasing order of their base prices and prioritize buying on the cheapest days first.

But buying on a cheap day increases the prices for subsequent days, which might offset the savings.

So, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the problem as assigning each ticket to a specific day, and calculating the cost for that assignment, then finding the assignment with the minimum total cost.

But with k up to 10^9, that's not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the following idea:

- Sort the days in increasing order of their base prices.

- Decide how many tickets to buy on each of the first q days, where q is the minimum number of days needed to buy k tickets (q = ceil(k/m)).

- Assign as many tickets as possible to the cheapest days, considering the price increments for subsequent days.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the total cost by considering the sum of the base prices for the tickets bought, plus the sum of the increments due to the tickets bought on earlier days.

But I need to find a way to calculate this efficiently.

Let me consider that if I buy x tickets on day i, then for all days j > i, the price increases by x.

So, the total cost can be expressed as:

sum over i from 1 to n of (a_i * number of tickets bought on day i) +

sum over i from 1 to n of (number of tickets bought on earlier days) * (number of tickets bought on day i)

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a schedule of how many tickets to buy on each day.

Let t_i be the number of tickets bought on day i.

Then, the total cost is:

sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of t_j)

Which is:

sum over i from 1 to n of (t_i * a_i) + (t_i * sum over j from 1 to i-1 of t_j)

This can be rewritten as:

sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * a_i + sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * (sum over j=1 to i-1 of t_j)

Which is:

sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * a_i + sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * (total tickets bought before day i)

Now, to minimize this total cost, I need to assign the t_i's in a way that minimizes this expression.

Given that, perhaps I should prioritize buying tickets on days with lower a_i, but also considering the impact of those purchases on future days.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that the cost of buying a ticket on day i is a_i plus the number of tickets bought on all previous days.

So, the cost per ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of t_j for j from 1 to i-1.

Therefore, the total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * (a_i + sum over j=1 to i-1 of t_j)

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Maybe I can rearrange the terms.

Let me denote s_i = sum over j=1 to i of t_j

Then, the total cost is:

sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Where s_0 = 0

Which is:

sum over i from 1 to n of (t_i * a_i) + (t_i * s_{i-1})

But s_{i-1} = s_i - t_i

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, since s_i is the cumulative sum of t_j up to i, maybe I can express the total cost in terms of s_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as:

sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * a_i + sum over j from 1 to n of t_j * sum over i=j+1 to n of t_i

Which is sum over i from 1 to n of t_i * a_i + sum over i=1 to n sum over j=i+1 to n of t_i * t_j

This seems like a sum of individual costs plus a sum of pairwise interactions.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me look back at the provided program.

It sorts the days in ascending order of their base prices.

Then, it calculates q as the ceiling of k/m.

Then, it takes the first q days with the lowest prices.

Then, it checks if n*m*q equals k, but that seems off.

Wait, n is the number of days, m is the maximum tickets per day, and q is the number of days needed to buy k tickets.

Wait, perhaps it's considering buying m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and the remaining on the q-th day.

Wait, let's see.

In the first example:

n=4, m=2, k=3

sorted M: [2,4,6,8]

q = ceil(3/2) = 2

So, take the first 2 days: [2,4]

Then, since 2*2 = 4 which is greater than k=3, it goes to the else clause.

In the else clause:

w = N.pop() = 4

mu = k - (n-1)*m = 3 - (2-1)*2 = 3 - 2 =1

cost = mu*w =1*4=4

n = len(N) =1

cost += m*sum(N) =2*2=4 + 2*2*(0) +1*2*1=4+0+2=6

Total cost:4+6=10, which matches the first sample.

In the second example:

n=4, m=2, k=8

sorted M: [2,4,6,8]

q = ceil(8/2)=4

Take first 4 days: [2,4,6,8]

n*m*q=4*2*4=32 which is not equal to k=8.

Wait, but k=8 and m=2, q=4, n=4, n*m*q=4*2*4=32, which is greater than k=8.

But in the if condition, it checks if n*m==k, which is 4*2=8==k=8.

Wait, in the code, it's checking if n*m*q ==k, but q=ceil(k/m), so n*m*ceil(k/m)==k.

In this case, n=4, m=2, k=8, q=4, n*m*q=4*2*4=32 !=8, so it goes to else clause.

But in the else clause:

w = N.pop()=8

mu =k - (n-1)*m=8 - (4-1)*2=8-6=2

cost =2*8=16

n=len(N)=3

cost +=2*(2+4+6)=2*12=24 + 3*2*2=12, total 24+12=36, plus previous 16 is 52, but sample output is 64.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, in the code, it's:

if n*m ==k:

cost = m*sum(N) + m*m*((n-1)*n//2)

else:

w = N.pop()

mu =k - (n-1)*m

cost = mu*w

n=len(N)

cost += m*sum(N) + m*m*((n-1)*(n-2)//2) + n*m*mu

In the second sample:

n=4, m=2, k=8

sorted M: [2,4,6,8]

q=4

N=[2,4,6,8]

n=4

mu=8 - (4-1)*2=8-6=2

cost=2*8=16

n=3

cost +=2*(2+4+6)=2*12=24 + 2*2*(3-1)*(3-2)//2=4*3*2/2=12 + 3*2*2=12

Total cost:16+24+12+12=64, which matches the sample.

Okay, so the code seems to be calculating it correctly for the samples.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me try to understand the logic behind the code.

It sorts the days by their base prices.

Then, it calculates q as the ceiling of k/m, which is the minimum number of days needed to buy k tickets.

Then, it takes the first q days with the lowest base prices.

Then, it considers two cases:

1. If n*m ==k, which would mean that buying m tickets on each of the n days gives exactly k tickets.

But in the code, it's checking if n*m*q ==k, which seems odd because n, m, q are related to the number of days, max tickets per day, and the number of days needed to buy k tickets.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in the variables.

In the code, n is the number of days, m is the max tickets per day, k is the total tickets to buy, and q is ceil(k/m), which is the minimum number of days needed to buy k tickets.

Then, it takes the first q days with the lowest base prices.

Then, if n*m ==k, which seems unrelated, because n*m is the total tickets that can be bought in n days buying m each day.

But k can be less than or equal to n*m.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be q*m ==k, which would mean that buying m tickets each day for q days gives exactly k tickets.

But in the code, it's checking if n*m ==k.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because n is the total number of days, m is the max tickets per day, and k is the total tickets to buy.

I think there's a confusion in the variables.

Perhaps the author intended to check if q*m ==k, meaning that buying m tickets each day for q days gives exactly k tickets.

In that case, the cost would be m*sum of the first q days' base prices plus m*m*sum of the first q-1 integers.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as buying m tickets on each of the first q-1 days, and k - (q-1)*m tickets on the q-th day.

Then, the cost would be sum over the first q-1 days of m*(a_i + sum of t_j for j <i) plus the q-th day's cost.

This seems complicated, but maybe that's what the code is doing.

In the if clause, when q*m ==k, it calculates cost as m*sum(N) + m*m*((n-1)*n//2)

But in the else clause, it pops the last element, calculates mu=k - (n-1)*m, and so on.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the days in sorted order and assign the maximum possible tickets to the cheapest days, considering the price increments for future days.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of their base prices.

Then, I assign as many tickets as possible to the cheapest days, up to m per day.

But since buying tickets on earlier days increases the prices for later days, I need to balance between buying on cheap days and not making the later days too expensive.

This seems like a trade-off.

Perhaps the optimal strategy is to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, but not more than necessary, to avoid increasing the prices for later days too much.

But I'm still not sure.

Let me consider that the increment per ticket bought on a day is applied to all subsequent days.

So, each ticket bought on day i increases the base price by 1 for all j >i.

Therefore, the total price per ticket on day j is a_j plus the sum of t_i for all i <j.

So, the total cost is sum over j from 1 to n of t_j * (a_j + sum over i=1 to j-1 of t_i)

This is the same as sum over j of (t_j * a_j) + (t_j * sum over i=1 to j-1 of t_i)

Which is sum over j of t_j * a_j + sum over i=1 to j-1 of t_i * t_j

So, sum over j of t_j * a_j + sum over all i <j of t_i * t_j

This seems like a sum of individual costs plus a sum of pairwise interactions.

This is similar to a quadratic form, where the cost matrix has certain properties.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to minimize this expression by choosing t_j's appropriately, under the constraints that sum of t_j's is k and t_j <=m for all j.

This seems complex.

Maybe I need to consider the dual problem or find some way to decompose this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the days are sorted by their base prices and find a way to assign tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

Let me consider that the incremental cost per ticket on day j is a_j plus the sum of t_i for i <j.

So, if I assign t_j tickets to day j, their cost would be t_j * (a_j + sum of t_i for i <j)

To minimize the total cost, I should prioritize days with lower a_j and lower sum of t_i for i <j.

But since sum of t_i for i <j increases as j increases, earlier days have lower sum of t_i.

Therefore, there's a trade-off between choosing days with lower a_j and choosing earlier days to minimize the sum of t_i for i <j.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look back at the provided code and see if I can make sense of its logic.

It sorts the days in ascending order of their base prices.

Then, it calculates q as ceil(k/m), which is the minimum number of days needed to buy k tickets.

Then, it takes the first q days with the lowest base prices.

Then, it checks if n*m ==k, but n is the number of days, m is the max tickets per day, and k is the total tickets to buy.

This seems off.

Wait, perhaps the author intended n to be q, the number of days used.

Wait, no, n is the total number of days.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in variable names.

Let me try to rename variables in my mind.

Let me call:

- d = number of days (n in the code)

- m = max tickets per day

- k = total tickets to buy

- p = array of base prices sorted in ascending order

Then, q = ceil(k/m), which is the minimum number of days needed to buy k tickets.

Then, take the first q days with the lowest base prices, p[0] to p[q-1]

Then, if q*m ==k, meaning that buying m tickets on each of the q days gives exactly k tickets.

In that case, cost is m*sum(p[0] to p[q-1]) + m*m*sum of (number of days before day i)

Wait, in the code, it's m*sum(N) + m*m*((n-1)*n//2)

But n is the number of days, which is d, not q.

Wait, no, in the code, n is set to q, the number of days used.

Wait, looking back at the code:

M = list of base prices

n = number of days

m = min(m, k)

M.sort()

q = ceil(k/m)

N = M[:q]

n = len(N)

Then, if n*m ==k:

cost = m*sum(N) + m*m*((n-1)*n//2)

else:

w = N.pop()

mu = k - (n-1)*m

cost = mu*w

n = len(N)

cost += m*sum(N) + m*m*((n-1)*(n-2)//2) + n*m*mu

Wait, perhaps the author is modeling the problem by assigning m tickets to each of the first q-1 days, and the remaining tickets to the q-th day.

Then, calculating the total cost based on that.

Let me consider that.

If q is the number of days needed, then:

- Buy m tickets on each of the first q-1 days

- Buy k - (q-1)*m tickets on the q-th day

Then, the cost would be:

For each of the first q-1 days:

- base price p_i + sum of t_j for j <i

Since t_j = m for j <i, sum of t_j for j <i is m*(i-1)

So, cost per ticket on day i is p_i + m*(i-1)

Total cost for day i: m * (p_i + m*(i-1))

For the q-th day:

- base price p_q + sum of t_j for j <q

- t_j = m for j from 1 to q-1, so sum of t_j = m*(q-1)

- number of tickets: mu = k - (q-1)*m

- total cost: mu * (p_q + m*(q-1))

So, total cost:

sum over i=1 to q-1 of m*(p_i + m*(i-1)) + mu*(p_q + m*(q-1))

Let's see if this matches the code's calculation.

In the if clause, when n*m ==k:

cost = m*sum(N) + m*m*((n-1)*n//2)

Which matches sum over i=1 to q-1 of m*(p_i + m*(i-1)) + m*(p_q + m*(q-1))

Wait, but in the code, n is q, and in the if clause, it's n*m ==k, which would be q*m ==k.

Wait, in the first sample, q=2, m=2, k=3, so q*m=4 !=3, so it goes to else clause.

In the else clause:

w = N.pop()=4

mu =k - (n-1)*m=3 -1*2=1

cost =1*4=4

n=len(N)=1

cost +=2*2 +2*2*(1-1)*(1-2)/2 +1*2*1=4 +0 +2=6

Total cost:4+6=10, which matches the first sample.

In the second sample:

q=4, m=2, k=8, q*m=8==k, so it should go to the if clause.

cost=2*sum([2,4,6,8]) +2*2*((4-1)*4//2)=2*20 +4*(3*4/2)=40 +4*6=40+24=64, which matches the second sample.

So, it seems the code is correctly calculating the total cost based on this logic.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
