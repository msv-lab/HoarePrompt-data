Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array of integers. Alice starts with an empty array c. They take turns, with Alice going first. On Alice's turn, she picks an element from the original array a, appends it to c, and deletes it from a. Bob, on his turn, picks an element from a, and just deletes it from a. The game ends when a is empty, and the score is the MEX of c, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in c. Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final score will be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX stands for minimum excludant, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example, for [2,2,1], MEX is 0; for [3,1,0,1], it's 2; and for [0,3,1,2], it's 4.

So, the game is about choosing elements to include in c (only Alice does that), and the final score is the MEX of c. Alice wants to maximize this MEX, meaning she wants c to have as many of the smaller integers as possible, up to a certain point. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including certain elements in c.

Let me think about how the game progresses. The total number of turns is equal to n, the size of the array. Since Alice starts, she will have ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob will have floor(n/2) turns. Wait, no. Let's think again. They alternate turns, with Alice starting. So, if n is even, both have n/2 turns. If n is odd, Alice has n/2 + 1 turns.

But actually, the number of turns each has isn't directly relevant, because Bob can delete elements that Alice might want, or that could affect the MEX.

I need to consider what elements are in the array and how many of each there are.

Let's consider that the array consists of integers from 0 to n-1, but not necessarily in that range, as per the problem statement, a_i can be from 0 to n-1.

Wait, no, looking back at the problem, a_i can be from 0 to n-1, as per the input constraints.

So, the array a contains n integers, each in the range [0, n-1].

I need to determine the final MEX of c when both play optimally.

Let me consider some small examples to get a feel for the problem.

Example 1:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

Let's see why.

First test case: n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

A possible game is:

- Alice picks 1, a becomes [0,0,1], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0, a becomes [0,1], c=[1]

- Alice picks 0, a becomes [1], c=[1,0]

- Bob picks 1, a becomes empty, c=[1,0]

MEX of c is 2, which matches the sample output.

Another possible game:

- Alice picks 0, a becomes [0,1,1], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1, a becomes [0,1], c=[0]

- Alice picks 1, a becomes [0], c=[0,1]

- Bob picks 0, a becomes empty, c=[0,1]

MEX is still 2.

Is there a way for Bob to force a lower MEX? Let's see.

- Alice picks 0, a=[0,1,1], c=[0]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,1], c=[0]

- Alice picks 1, a=[1], c=[0,1]

- Bob picks 1, a empty, c=[0,1]

Again, MEX is 2.

Or:

- Alice picks 1, a=[0,0,1], c=[1]

- Bob picks 1, a=[0,0], c=[1]

- Alice picks 0, a=[0], c=[1,0]

- Bob picks 0, a empty, c=[1,0]

MEX is 2.

It seems like MEX is always 2 in this case, no matter what Bob does.

Example 2:

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible game:

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[0,2]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[0,2]

MEX is 1.

Another game:

- Alice picks 1, a=[0,2,3], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3], c=[1]

- Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[1,2]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[1,2]

MEX is 0.

Another game:

- Alice picks 3, a=[0,1,2], c=[3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,2], c=[3]

- Alice picks 1, a=[2], c=[3,1]

- Bob picks 2, a empty, c=[3,1]

MEX is 0.

It seems that Bob can force the MEX to be 0 or 1, but in the sample output, it's 1. So, perhaps there's a better strategy where MEX is 1.

Wait, in the sample output, it's 1, but in my examples, I got MEX=0. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Alice can achieve MEX=1.

- Alice picks 0, a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 2, a=[3], c=[0,2]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[0,2]

MEX is 1.

Yes, that works. So, MEX can be 1.

Is there a way for Alice to get MEX=2? Let's see.

- Alice picks 2, a=[0,1,3], c=[2]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,3], c=[2]

- Alice picks 1, a=[3], c=[2,1]

- Bob picks 3, a empty, c=[2,1]

MEX is 0.

Not better.

Or:

- Alice picks 1, a=[0,2,3], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3], c=[1]

- Alice picks 3, a=[2], c=[1,3]

- Bob picks 2, a empty, c=[1,3]

MEX is 0.

So, in this case, the best Alice can do is MEX=1.

Example 3:

n=2, a=[1,1]

Possible game:

- Alice picks 1, a=[1], c=[1]

- Bob picks 1, a empty, c=[1]

MEX is 0.

Another game:

- Alice picks 1, a=[1], c=[1]

- Bob picks 1, a empty, c=[1]

MEX is 0.

So, MEX is always 0 in this case.

From these examples, it seems like the MEX depends on how Alice can include the smallest integers in c, while Bob tries to prevent that.

I need to find a general strategy for both players.

Let me think about the frequency of each number in the array.

Suppose I count the occurrences of each number from 0 to n-1 in the array.

Let's define a counter mpp where mpp[i] is the number of times i appears in a.

Now, both players will be choosing elements from a in turns, with Alice choosing what to include in c.

I need to simulate their optimal play to determine what c will look like at the end.

But simulating each move explicitly would be too slow, as n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 2e4, with the total sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5.

So, I need a smarter way to compute the MEX without simulating each move.

Let me think about what determines the MEX.

The MEX is the smallest missing integer in c.

So, to maximize the MEX, Alice wants to include as many of the smaller integers in c as possible.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including certain smaller integers in c.

Since Alice can choose what to include in c, and Bob can delete elements, including those that Alice might want.

Wait, but Bob can only delete elements, not choose what goes into c.

Wait, no, Bob deletes an element from a, which is not added to c.

So, Bob can choose to delete an element that Alice might want to include in c, thereby forcing Alice to include a different element.

Wait, but in Alice's turn, she picks an element to append to c and then deletes it from a.

In Bob's turn, he picks an element to delete from a.

So, Bob can delete elements that Alice might want to include in c later, or he can delete elements that are not important, depending on his strategy.

So, Bob can interfere with Alice's strategy by deleting elements that she might need to achieve a higher MEX.

I need to think about how to balance this.

Let me consider that Alice wants to include as many of the smallest integers in c as possible, while Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each integer i from 0 to n, starting from 0, I need to determine if Alice can include i in c, despite Bob's attempts to prevent it.

If Alice can include i in c, then MEX will be the first i that she cannot include.

Wait, but MEX is the smallest missing integer in c.

So, if c contains all integers from 0 to k-1, but not k, then MEX is k.

So, I need to find the smallest k such that c does not contain k.

Given that, I need to determine the largest k such that Alice can include all integers from 0 to k in c, against Bob's opposition.

So, I need to find the maximum k such that, in the game, Alice can ensure that c contains all integers from 0 to k.

Bob will try to prevent this.

So, for each k from 0 to n, I need to check if Alice can include all integers from 0 to k in c, assuming Bob plays optimally to prevent it.

This sounds like a minimax problem, where Alice tries to maximize k, and Bob tries to minimize it.

To solve this efficiently, I need to find a way to compute k without simulating the game.

Let me consider the frequencies of each integer.

Suppose I have the count of each integer in a.

For each integer i from 0 to n, if mpp[i] is the number of times i appears in a.

Alice needs to include i in c at least once to have it in c.

Bob can delete instances of i, but Alice can choose to include i if it's still in a.

However, Bob can delete i to make it harder for Alice.

I need to model how Alice and Bob's turns alternate and how they affect the availability of elements.

This seems complicated to simulate directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can include i in c before Bob deletes all instances of i.

Wait, but Alice only includes one element per turn, and Bob deletes one element per turn.

I need to think about the sequence of moves.

Let me consider that the total number of moves is n, with Alice moving first.

So, there are ceil(n/2) moves for Alice and floor(n/2) moves for Bob.

Wait, no. If n is even, Alice and Bob each have n/2 moves. If n is odd, Alice has n/2 + 1 moves.

But perhaps counting moves isn't the most effective way.

Let me consider that Alice wants to include as many of the smallest integers in c as possible, while Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each integer i from 0 to n, I need to determine if Alice can include i in c, given that Bob can delete elements.

I need to find the smallest i that Alice cannot include in c, no matter how she plays.

Wait, but Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which is the smallest missing integer in c.

So, she wants to include as many small integers as possible in c.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, meaning he wants to make sure that some small integer is missing from c.

So, I need to find the smallest i such that, even with Alice's best efforts, i is not included in c.

To model this, I can consider that Alice needs to include i in c at least once, and Bob is trying to prevent that.

So, for each i from 0 to n, I need to check if Alice can include i in c at least once, despite Bob's deletions.

If Alice can include i, then that i is present in c, and MEX is higher.

If Alice cannot include i, then MEX is i.

So, I need to find the smallest i for which Alice cannot include i in c.

Now, how do I determine if Alice can include i in c?

Alice can include i in c if she can pick i before all instances of i are deleted by Bob.

So, for a given i, suppose there are m instances of i in a.

Alice and Bob take turns deleting elements, with Alice choosing what to include in c.

Alice wants to include i at least once, while Bob tries to delete all instances of i before Alice can include any.

Wait, but Bob can only delete one element per turn, and Alice includes one element per turn.

So, for a given i, if there are m instances of i in a, Alice needs at least one of them to be included in c before Bob deletes all of them.

But Bob can delete m elements of i in m turns, potentially deleting all instances before Alice can include any.

However, Alice also deletes an element each turn when she includes it in c.

So, effectively, each player deletes one element per turn, but Alice also includes one element in c per her turn.

So, the total number of deletions is n, same as the number of turns.

I need to model this more carefully.

Let me consider that the game is a sequence of n turns, alternating between Alice and Bob, with Alice starting.

In each turn:

- Alice chooses an element to include in c and deletes it from a.

- Bob chooses an element to delete from a.

So, in total, Alice includes n//2 elements in c (if n is even) or n//2 + 1 elements in c (if n is odd).

But I need to consider that Bob can delete elements that Alice might want to include.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each element appears and how many turns Alice gets to include them.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the integers from 0 to n and for each i, I check if Alice can include i in c.

To include i in c, Alice needs to pick i in one of her turns before all instances of i are deleted by Bob.

Given that Bob is trying to prevent this, he will try to delete i as much as possible.

So, for a given i, if there are m instances of i, and Alice has a certain number of turns, and Bob has a certain number of turns, I need to see if Alice can pick at least one i in her turns before Bob deletes all m instances.

This seems like a race between Alice and Bob: Alice trying to include i, Bob trying to delete all i's.

I need to find out, for each i, whether Alice can include at least one i in c before Bob deletes all m instances.

If Alice can do that for all i from 0 to k, but not for k+1, then the MEX is k+1.

But this seems too vague. I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider the frequency of each i.

Suppose mpp[i] is the frequency of i in a.

Alice needs at least one i in c, which means she needs to include at least one i in c before Bob deletes all mpp[i] instances.

Each time Alice picks i, she includes it in c and deletes it from a.

Each time Bob picks i, he deletes it from a.

So, for a given i, the number of i's decreases by one each time either Alice or Bob picks i.

Alice wants to include i at least once, while Bob wants to ensure that Alice cannot include i.

This is similar to a game where Alice and Bob are competing over the instances of i.

I need to find out, for each i, whether Alice can include at least one i in c, given that Bob is trying to prevent it.

Let's model this as a game where there are mpp[i] tokens, and Alice and Bob take turns removing tokens, with Alice going first.

Alice wins if she can remove at least one token, and Bob wins if he can prevent Alice from removing any tokens.

Wait, but in this game, Alice and Bob are choosing elements from the entire array, not just from i's.

So, this analogy might not hold directly.

Perhaps I need to think about the total number of turns and how Alice can allocate her turns to include the necessary i's.

Let me consider that Alice has a certain number of turns to include elements in c, and Bob has his turns to delete elements.

I need to maximize the MEX, which is the smallest missing integer in c.

So, for each i from 0 to n, I need to check if Alice can include i in c.

If she can include i, then MEX is higher; if she cannot, then MEX is i.

I need to find the smallest i where Alice cannot include i in c.

To find this, perhaps I can iterate through i from 0 to n and find the first i where Alice cannot include it.

Now, to determine for a particular i whether Alice can include it in c, considering Bob's deletions.

Let's fix an i and see if Alice can include it.

Suppose mpp[i] is the number of instances of i in a.

Alice needs to include at least one i in c before Bob deletes all mpp[i] instances.

Each time Alice picks i, she includes it in c and deletes it.

Each time Bob picks i, he deletes it.

So, effectively, the game is a sequence of turns where Alice and Bob are choosing elements to delete, with Alice also including one element in c per her turn.

I need to see if Alice can include at least one i in c before all i's are deleted.

This seems similar to Alice and Bob playing a game over the mpp[i] instances of i, where Alice wants to capture at least one, and Bob wants to prevent it.

But since the game involves choosing from the entire array, not just from i's, it's more complex.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the total number of turns Alice has and the total number of deletions Bob can make.

Let me calculate the total number of turns Alice has.

If n is even, Alice has n/2 turns; if n is odd, Alice has n/2 + 1 turns.

But perhaps that's not directly helpful.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to find out which elements Alice can include in c.

She can include up to ceil(n/2) elements in c, since she has ceil(n/2) turns.

But Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements.

However, Bob's deletions can interfere with Alice's inclusion.

I need to find out which elements Alice can include in c, considering Bob's deletions.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each element appears and how many turns Alice has.

If an element i appears only once, and Alice doesn't pick it, Bob can delete it.

So, for elements that appear only once, Alice needs to pick them in her turn to include them in c, otherwise Bob can delete them.

If an element appears multiple times, Alice has more chances to pick it.

Wait, perhaps I can categorize elements based on their frequency.

Let me consider mpp[i], the frequency of i.

For elements with mpp[i] == 1:

- Alice must pick i in her turn to include it in c, otherwise Bob can delete it.

For elements with mpp[i] >= 2:

- Alice has more flexibility, as even if Bob deletes some, there are still instances left.

So, for elements with mpp[i] == 1, Alice needs to include them in c during her turns to ensure they are in c.

Bob can try to delete them, but if Alice picks them, they go into c.

Wait, but if Alice picks an element with mpp[i] == 1, it goes into c and is deleted from a.

Bob cannot delete it after that.

So, for elements with mpp[i] == 1, Alice can choose to include them in c, and if she does, they are in c.

Bob cannot prevent that.

However, Bob can choose to delete other elements.

Wait, but Bob can also delete elements with mpp[i] == 1 that Alice hasn't picked yet.

So, if there are multiple elements with mpp[i] == 1, Bob can delete some of them, preventing Alice from including them in c.

Wait, no, Bob can only delete one element per turn, but Alice also picks one element per turn.

So, in terms of mpp[i] == 1 elements, Alice needs to pick them before Bob deletes them.

So, for each element with mpp[i] == 1, Alice needs to pick it in one of her turns before Bob deletes it.

Given that Alice has ceil(n/2) turns and Bob has floor(n/2) turns, depending on n.

If the number of elements with mpp[i] == 1 is less than or equal to Alice's turns, she can pick all of them, ensuring they are in c.

If the number of such elements is greater than Alice's turns, then some of them will be deleted by Bob.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that Alice can pick up to ceil(n/2) elements with mpp[i] == 1, and Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements with mpp[i] == 1.

So, the number of elements with mpp[i] == 1 that Alice can include in c is mpp[i]==1 - floor(n/2), but cannot be negative.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the difference between the number of elements with mpp[i]==1 and the number of Bob's turns.

So, if the number of elements with mpp[i]==1 is greater than Bob's turns, Alice can include at least some of them in c.

Wait, perhaps more precisely:

- Let s be the number of elements with mpp[i]==1.

- Bob has floor(n/2) turns to delete elements.

- Alice has ceil(n/2) turns to include elements.

- To maximize the MEX, Alice wants to include as many small i with mpp[i]==1 as possible.

- Bob wants to delete the smallest possible i with mpp[i]==1 to minimize the MEX.

So, if s <= floor(n/2), Bob can delete all elements with mpp[i]==1, so Alice cannot include any of them in c.

Hence, MEX would be the smallest i not present in a or present but deleted.

Wait, no, Alice can still include elements with mpp[i] > 1.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

I need to find the smallest i such that Alice cannot include i in c, considering Bob's deletions.

For each i, if mpp[i] >= 1, Alice can include it in c if she picks it before Bob deletes it.

If mpp[i] == 0, i is not in a, so MEX is i.

So, I need to find the smallest i where mpp[i] == 0 or where Alice cannot include i in c despite it being present in a.

Wait, but if mpp[i] >= 1, Alice can include it in c if she picks it before Bob deletes it.

So, for i with mpp[i] >= 1, Alice can include it in c unless Bob deletes all instances before Alice picks one.

For i with mpp[i] == 1, Alice needs to pick it before Bob deletes it.

For i with mpp[i] >= 2, Alice has more flexibility.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of turns Alice has compared to the number of elements with mpp[i]==1.

Let me define:

- Let s be the number of elements with mpp[i]==1.

- Let a_turns be ceil(n/2), the number of turns Alice has.

- Let b_turns be floor(n/2), the number of turns Bob has.

If s <= b_turns, Bob can delete all elements with mpp[i]==1, so Alice cannot include any of them in c.

Hence, for those i, they are not in c, and the MEX would be the smallest such i.

Wait, but Alice can also include elements with mpp[i] >=2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for elements with mpp[i] >=2, Alice can include at least one in c, as Bob cannot delete all instances before Alice picks one.

Wait, no, Bob can try to delete instances of i, but since there are multiple, Alice might still be able to pick one.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me look back at the sample input.

Sample Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Sample Output:

2

1

0

In the first test case, n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

So, mpp[0]=2, mpp[1]=2

Alice can include both 0 and 1 in c.

So, c will have both 0 and 1, hence MEX is 2.

In the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

mpp[0]=1, mpp[1]=1, mpp[2]=1, mpp[3]=1

s=4 (all have mpp[i]==1)

a_turns=ceil(4/2)=2

b_turns=floor(4/2)=2

So, Bob can delete 2 elements with mpp[i]==1.

Hence, Alice can include at most 2 elements with mpp[i]==1.

So, she can include 0 and 1, for example.

Then, c=[0,1], MEX is 2.

Wait, but the sample output is 1.

So, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe Alice can only include one of them.

Wait, n=4, ceil(4/2)=2 turns for Alice.

Bob has floor(4/2)=2 turns.

So, Alice can include 2 elements in c.

But Bob can delete 2 elements.

So, in this case, Alice can include 2 elements, but Bob can delete 2 elements.

So, in terms of MEX, Alice wants to include the smallest possible elements.

But Bob can delete some elements to prevent Alice from including certain ones.

In this case, perhaps Bob can delete an element that Alice wants to include.

Wait, but Alice chooses first.

Let me consider the sequence:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob deletes 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob deletes 3, a empty

MEX is 1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob deletes 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob deletes 3, a empty

MEX is 0.

But the sample output is 1, so perhaps in optimal play, MEX is 1.

Wait, perhaps Alice can force MEX to be 1.

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob deletes 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob deletes 3, a empty

MEX is 1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob deletes 2, a=[1,3]

- Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[3]

- Bob deletes 3, a empty

MEX is 2.

So, depending on Bob's choices, MEX can be 1 or 2.

But Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he would choose to delete 1, forcing MEX to be 1.

Hence, the output is 1.

In the third test case, n=2, a=[1,1]

mpp[1]=2

So, mpp[1]>=2, Alice can include at least one 1 in c.

Bob can delete one element.

So, c will have one 1, MEX is 0.

Wait, but mpp[0]=0, so 0 is not in a.

Hence, MEX is 0.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 0.

Wait, no, in the third test case, n=2, a=[1,1], mpp[1]=2, mpp[0]=0.

So, 0 is not in a, hence MEX is 0.

Wait, but in the game, c can have [1], MEX is 0, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, since 0 is not in a, MEX is 0 regardless of what Alice and Bob do.

Now, perhaps I can generalize this.

For each i from 0 to n:

- If mpp[i] == 0, then i is not in a, so MEX could be i.

- If mpp[i] >=1, then Alice can include i in c if she picks it before Bob deletes all instances.

Wait, but in the second test case, mpp[0]=1, mpp[1]=1, mpp[2]=1, mpp[3]=1.

Alice has 2 turns, Bob has 2 turns.

Alice can include 2 elements in c.

Bob can delete 2 elements.

So, Alice can include two elements, and Bob can delete two elements.

The question is which elements Alice can include.

If Alice includes two elements, say 0 and 1, then c=[0,1], MEX is 2.

If Alice includes 0 and 2, MEX is 1.

If Alice includes 0 and 3, MEX is 1.

If Alice includes 1 and 2, MEX is 0.

If Alice includes 1 and 3, MEX is 0.

If Alice includes 2 and 3, MEX is 0.

Bob, wanting to minimize MEX, would choose deletions to minimize MEX.

So, Bob would delete elements that help minimize MEX.

In this case, Bob can delete elements to force MEX to be 1.

Hence, the output is 1.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it's 1.

So, perhaps the MEX is the smallest i where mpp[i] <= b_turns.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through i from 0 to n and check if mpp[i] > b_turns.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through i from 0 to n and check if Alice can include i in c.

For i where mpp[i] >=1, Alice can include i in c if she picks it before Bob deletes all mpp[i] instances.

If mpp[i] ==1, Alice needs to pick it in one of her turns before Bob deletes it.

If mpp[i] >=2, Alice can include it even if Bob deletes some instances.

Wait, but in the second test case, for i=0, mpp[0]=1.

Alice needs to pick it before Bob deletes it.

She has 2 turns, Bob has 2 turns.

So, if Alice picks 0 in one of her turns, she includes it in c.

If she doesn't, Bob can delete it.

Similarly for i=1,2,3.

So, Alice can choose to include two of them, and Bob can delete two of them.

Hence, in c, there will be two elements, and the MEX will be the smallest i not in c.

Given that, Bob can choose to delete elements to minimize the MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal MEX over all possible games.

But that seems too broad.

Let me consider that Alice can choose any two elements to include in c, and Bob can choose any two elements to delete.

The remaining elements in c are the two Alice chose.

Bob can influence which two elements are in c by deleting elements.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to ensure that smaller elements are not in c.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she wants to include as many small elements as possible.

Hence, in the second test case, Alice can choose to include 0 and 1, resulting in MEX=2.

But Bob can try to prevent that by deleting one of them.

Wait, but Alice chooses first.

So, perhaps:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob deletes 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob deletes 3, a empty

MEX is 1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob deletes 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob deletes 3, a empty

MEX is 0.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 2, c=[2], a=[0,1,3]

- Bob deletes 0, a=[1,3]

- Alice picks 1, c=[2,1], a=[3]

- Bob deletes 3, a empty

MEX is 0.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 3, c=[3], a=[0,1,2]

- Bob deletes 0, a=[1,2]

- Alice picks 1, c=[3,1], a=[2]

- Bob deletes 2, a empty

MEX is 0.

So, in all these scenarios, MEX is either 0 or 1.

But in the first scenario, MEX is 1.

Hence, the minimal MEX achievable is 1, which is the output.

Wait, but in one scenario, MEX is 1.

So, perhaps the minimal MEX is 1.

Wait, but in other scenarios, MEX is 0.

But Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he would choose the deletion that results in MEX=0.

But Alice wants to maximize MEX, so she would choose the inclusion that results in MEX=1.

Wait, but in this case, Bob can force MEX=0 by deleting appropriately.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of turns and the frequency of each element.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of turns Alice has to include elements.

Let me consider that Alice can include ceil(n/2) elements in c.

Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements.

Hence, the total number of elements in c is ceil(n/2).

Then, the MEX is the smallest i not in c.

Alice wants to maximize this MEX, so she wants to include the smallest possible elements in c.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants Alice to include larger elements in c.

Wait, but Bob cannot choose what Alice includes; he can only delete elements from a.

Wait, actually, Bob can influence which elements Alice can include by deleting elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the elements that Alice can include.

Let me consider that Alice can include ceil(n/2) elements in c, choosing from the available elements in a at each turn.

Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements from a, choosing elements that prevent Alice from including certain elements.

Hence, Bob can delete elements that Alice wants to include.

So, for elements with mpp[i]==1, Alice must pick them before Bob deletes them.

For elements with mpp[i]>=2, Alice has more flexibility.

Hence, for elements with mpp[i]==1, if the number of such elements is greater than Alice's turns, some of them will be deleted by Bob.

Hence, Alice can include up to ceil(n/2) elements with mpp[i]==1.

Wait, but Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements.

So, the number of elements with mpp[i]==1 that Alice can include is mpp[i]==1 - floor(n/2), but not less than zero.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the number of elements with mpp[i]==1 that Alice can include is min(ceil(n/2), mpp[i]==1).

But I need to think about which elements Alice can include.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the elements with mpp[i]==1 and decide which ones Alice can include.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some games, the minimax theorem can be applied, where the minimal maximum is equal to the maximal minimum.

In this case, Alice tries to maximize the MEX, and Bob tries to minimize it.

Hence, I need to find the MEX where Alice cannot do better, and Bob cannot do worse.

Perhaps I can iterate through i from 0 to n and check if Alice can include i in c.

If she can, then MEX is higher; if not, MEX is i.

To check if Alice can include i in c, given that Bob is trying to prevent it.

For i with mpp[i]>=1, Alice can include i if she picks it before Bob deletes it.

For i with mpp[i]>=2, Alice can include at least one even if Bob deletes some.

Wait, for i with mpp[i]>=2, Alice can always include at least one in c, because even if Bob
