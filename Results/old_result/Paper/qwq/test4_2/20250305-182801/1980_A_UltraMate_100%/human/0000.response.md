Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vlad is planning to hold m rounds of something, and each round needs one problem of each difficulty level: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. He already has a bank of n problems with various difficulty levels, and he might need to create some additional problems to have enough for m rounds.

My task is to determine the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to have enough for m rounds.

First, I need to understand the requirements. Each round requires one problem of each difficulty level: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So, for m rounds, he needs m problems of each difficulty level.

Given that he has n problems already, I need to check how many of each difficulty level he has and see if it's sufficient for m rounds. If not, I need to calculate how many more he needs to create.

Let me think about the example provided:

Input:

3

10 1

BGECDCBDED

10 2

BGECDCBDED

9 1

BBCDEFFGG

Output:

2

5

1

For the first test case:

n=10, m=1, problems: 'BGECDCBDED'

Difficulty counts:

A: 0

B: 3

C: 2

D: 3

E: 2

F: 0

G: 0

Since m=1, he needs at least 1 of each difficulty.

He is short of A, F, and G. So, he needs to create 1 A, 1 F, and 1 G. But the output is 2, which doesn't match my initial thought. Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, looking back: 'BGECDCBDED'

Let's count each:

B: 3

G: 1

E: 2

C: 2

D: 3

A: 0

F: 0

So, for m=1, he needs 1 of each A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

He has:

A: 0 -> needs 1

B: 3 -> has enough

C: 2 -> has enough

D: 3 -> has enough

E: 2 -> has enough

F: 0 -> needs 1

G: 1 -> has enough

So, he needs to create 1 A and 1 F, totaling 2 problems. That matches the first output.

Okay, got it.

For the second test case:

n=10, m=2, problems: 'BGECDCBDED'

Difficulty counts:

B: 3

G: 1

E: 2

C: 2

D: 3

A: 0

F: 0

For m=2, he needs 2 of each difficulty.

He has:

A: 0 -> needs 2

B: 3 -> has enough

C: 2 -> has enough

D: 3 -> has enough

E: 2 -> has enough

F: 0 -> needs 2

G: 1 -> needs 1

Total additional problems needed: 2(A) + 2(F) + 1(G) = 5, which matches the second output.

Third test case:

n=9, m=1, problems: 'BBCDEFFGG'

Difficulty counts:

B: 3

C: 1

D: 1

E: 1

F: 2

G: 2

A: 0

For m=1, he needs 1 of each.

He has:

A: 0 -> needs 1

B: 3 -> has enough

C: 1 -> has enough

D: 1 -> has enough

E: 1 -> has enough

F: 2 -> has enough

G: 2 -> has enough

So, he needs to create 1 A, which matches the third output.

Alright, now I need to think about how to implement this in code.

First, I need to read the number of test cases, t.

For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read the string s of length n, consisting of characters A-G.

- Count the frequency of each difficulty level in s.

- For each difficulty level (A-G), calculate how many more problems are needed.

- Sum up all the shortages and output the total.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to do something similar, but I need to verify.

Looking at the given program:

from collections import Counter

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

s = input()

ans = 0

p = 'ABCDEFG'

hmp = Counter(s)

for i in p:

if i not in hmp:

ans += m

for i in hmp:

if hmp[i] < m:

ans += m - hmp[i]

print(ans)

So, it uses Counter to count the frequency of each character in s.

Then, for each difficulty level in 'ABCDEFG', if it's not in hmp, it adds m to ans.

Then, for each difficulty level in hmp, if its count is less than m, it adds the difference to ans.

Wait, but in the first test case, for A and F, which are not in hmp, it adds m=1 for each, so ans += 1 + 1 = 2.

Then, for the levels that are in hmp, it checks if hmp[i] < m, and if so, adds m - hmp[i].

In the first test case, for B, hmp['B']=3, which is >=1, so no addition.

For G, hmp['G']=1, which is >=1, so no addition.

For E, hmp['E']=2 >=1, no addition.

For C, hmp['C']=2 >=1, no addition.

For D, hmp['D']=3 >=1, no addition.

So, total ans=2, which matches the first output.

In the second test case:

n=10, m=2, s='BGECDCBDED'

hmp:

B:3

G:1

E:2

C:2

D:3

A:0

F:0

For A and F not in hmp, ans +=2 +2=4

Then, for G, hmp['G']=1 <2, so ans +=2-1=1

Total ans=4+1=5, which matches the second output.

Third test case:

n=9, m=1, s='BBCDEFFGG'

hmp:

B:3

C:1

D:1

E:1

F:2

G:2

A:0

A not in hmp, ans +=1

Then, check for each in hmp:

G:2 >=1, no addition

F:2 >=1, no addition

E:1 >=1, no addition

D:1 >=1, no addition

C:1 >=1, no addition

B:3 >=1, no addition

Total ans=1, which matches the third output.

Seems correct.

But let me think if there are any edge cases where this might fail.

Edge case 1: m=0

But according to constraints, m >=1, so no need to handle m=0.

Edge case 2: n=0

If n=0, then hmp is empty, so for all A-G, ans +=m for each, total ans=7*m.

Edge case 3: m=5, n=35, s='ABCDEFG' repeated 5 times, so hmp:A=5, B=5, ..., G=5, so no additional problems needed.

Edge case 4: m=3, n=10, s='AAAAAAABBB', hmp:A=7, B=3, others=0, so ans=3*4=12, since C,G,D,E,F are missing.

Wait, no. For m=3, needs 3 of each.

He has A:7, B:3, others:0.

So, for A, has 7 >=3, no addition.

For B, has 3 >=3, no addition.

For C,G,D,E,F: each needs 3, but has 0, so ans +=3 for each missing difficulty.

Total ans=3*5=15.

Wait, but in the code, it only adds for difficulties not in hmp.

Wait, in the code, it first checks for each in 'ABCDEFG', if not in hmp, ans +=m.

Then, for each in hmp, if hmp[i]<m, ans +=m - hmp[i].

But in this case, C,G,D,E,F are not in hmp, so ans +=3*5=15.

Wait, but in the code, it's a separate loop.

Wait, but in the code, it's:

for i in p:

if i not in hmp:

ans += m

for i in hmp:

if hmp[i] < m:

ans += m - hmp[i]

So, in this case, for i in 'ABCDEFG':

if i not in hmp (i.e., C,D,E,F,G), ans +=3 for each.

Then, for i in hmp (A and B):

if hmp[A]=7 >=3, no addition.

hmp[B]=3 >=3, no addition.

Total ans=3*5=15, which is correct.

Seems fine.

Another edge case: m=1, n=7, s='ABCDEFG', hmp:A=1,B=1,C=1,D=1,E=1,F=1,G=1.

So, for m=1, he needs 1 of each, and he has exactly 1 of each, so ans=0.

In the code, for i in 'ABCDEFG', i in hmp, so no addition.

Then, for each in hmp, hmp[i]=1 >=1, no addition.

So, ans=0, which is correct.

Another edge case: m=2, n=7, s='ABCDEFG', hmp:A=1,B=1,C=1,D=1,E=1,F=1,G=1.

For m=2, needs 2 of each.

For each difficulty, hmp[i]=1 <2, so ans +=2-1=1 for each.

Total ans=7*1=7.

In the code:

for i in 'ABCDEFG', i in hmp, so no addition.

Then, for each in hmp, hmp[i]=1 <2, so ans +=1 for each.

Total ans=7, which is correct.

Seems correct.

Another edge case: m=2, n=10, s='AABBCCDDEE', hmp:A=2,B=2,C=2,D=2,E=2,F=0,G=0.

Needs m=2 of each.

For F and G, not in hmp, ans +=2 for each.

Then, for A,B,C,D,E, hmp[i]=2 >=2, no addition.

Total ans=4, which is correct.

Seems the code handles this correctly.

I think the logic is sound.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
