Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has a binary square grid of n by n cells, and on this grid, there's either a triangle or a square drawn with '1's. I need to figure out which shape is drawn based on the grid provided.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a triangle and a square in this context.

For a triangle:

- It's made up of k rows (k > 1), and each row has 2*i - 1 '1's, where i is the row number.

- The central '1's are aligned in one column, meaning it's a symmetric triangle, either right-side up or upside down.

- So, for example, if k=3, the rows would have 1, 3, 1 '1's for a right-side up triangle, or 3, 1, 1 for an upside-down one.

Wait, actually, the problem says "the central '1's are located in one column," which suggests that the peak of the triangle is aligned vertically. So, for k=3, it could be:

Row 1: two leading zeros, then a '1', then two zeros.

Row 2: one leading zero, then '111', then one zero.

Row 3: two leading zeros, then a '1', then two zeros.

That would be a right-side up triangle.

An upside-down triangle would have the base at the top.

For a square:

- It's k rows (k > 1), each with k '1's, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

- So, the square is aligned to the left edge, with each row having k '1's starting from the same column.

Given that, I need to look at the grid and determine if the '1's form a square or a triangle.

Looking at the provided code:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

k = []

for _ in range(int(input())):

b = input()

if '1' in b:

k.append(b.count('1'))

if k[0] == k[1]:

print(k)

Wait, this seems incomplete. It's reading the input, counting the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1', and then checking if the first two counts are equal. But that doesn't seem sufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

Let me think about this.

For a square, every row in the shape should have the same number of '1's, which is k, and they should start from the same column.

For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row increases and then decreases, forming a pyramid shape.

So, in the case of a square, all rows of the square should have exactly k '1's, and they should be aligned.

In the case of a triangle, the number of '1's per row follows a pattern like 1, 3, 5, ..., up to some maximum, and then back down, or just increasing or decreasing depending on the orientation.

So, in the code provided, it's collecting the count of '1's in each row that has at least one '1', and then checking if the first two counts are equal.

But that's not enough to distinguish between a square and a triangle.

For example, in a square of size k=3, every row would have exactly 3 '1's.

In a triangle of k=3, the rows might have 1, 3, 1 '1's.

So, if I just look at the first two rows, in a square, they would both have 3 '1's, in a triangle, they might have 1 and 3.

So, if k[0] == k[1], it might suggest a square, but I need to ensure that all rows have the same number of '1's.

Moreover, for triangles, the counts can vary.

So, perhaps a better approach is:

- Find the rows that contain '1's.

- Check if all these rows have the same number of '1's. If yes, it's a square.

- If the number of '1's increases and then decreases, it's a triangle.

But, in the triangle case, it could be increasing or decreasing depending on the orientation.

Wait, the problem says "the central '1's are located in one column," which suggests that in a triangle, the '1's are symmetric around a central column.

So, perhaps I need to look for symmetry in the distribution of '1's.

But that might be complicated.

Let me think differently.

Given that the square has k rows with exactly k '1's, all aligned from the same starting column.

So, in the grid, the '1's form a solid block aligned to the left.

While in a triangle, the '1's form a pyramid shape, with the number of '1's increasing or decreasing in each row.

So, perhaps I can count the number of '1's in each row and see if they are all equal (square) or if they follow a pattern of increasing and then decreasing (triangle).

But, in the code provided, it's only checking if the first two row counts are equal.

That's insufficient.

I need to check all the rows that have '1's.

So, I need to:

- Find the rows that contain '1's.

- If all these rows have the same number of '1's, and that number is equal to the number of rows, it's a square.

- If the number of '1's per row follows a pattern consistent with a triangle, it's a triangle.

But, to confirm it's a square, I need to ensure not only that each row has the same number of '1's but also that the '1's are aligned in the same columns across rows.

Wait, but the problem guarantees that there is exactly one shape (either a triangle or a square) consisting of all the '1's, and that the shape is larger than one cell.

So, perhaps I can proceed as follows:

- Find the rows that contain '1's.

- Find the leftmost and rightmost '1's in each row.

- For a square, all rows should have '1's starting from the same column and having the same width.

- For a triangle, the positions of '1's should be symmetric around a central column, with the number of '1's increasing or decreasing per row.

This seems more accurate.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Looking back at the code:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

k = []

for _ in range(int(input())):

b = input()

if '1' in b:

k.append(b.count('1'))

if k[0] == k[1]:

print(k)

This seems incomplete and incorrect.

First, it's reading the number of test cases, then for each test case:

- Reading n, the size of the grid.

- Reading n rows of the grid.

- For each row, if it contains at least one '1', it counts the number of '1's and appends it to list k.

- Then, it checks if the first two elements of k are equal, and prints k.

But this doesn't determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

It's missing the logic to make the decision based on the counts.

Moreover, it's printing k, which is just a list of counts, not the required "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

So, this program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
