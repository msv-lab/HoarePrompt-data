Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have n cities on a number line, each with a unique coordinate a_i, and they're sorted in ascending order. So, a1 < a2 < ... < a_n.

The distance between any two cities x and y is just the absolute difference between their coordinates: |a_x - a_y|.

For each city, there's a "closest" city, defined as the city that's nearest to it. Importantly, the problem states that for every city, this closest city is unique. So, no ties.

We can travel between cities in two ways:

1. Travel directly from city x to city y, paying the distance |a_x - a_y| coins.

2. Travel from city x to its closest city, paying just 1 coin.

Given m queries, each consisting of two different cities, I need to find the minimum number of coins required to travel from one to the other.

First, I need to understand the problem better.

Let's consider an example to get a feel for it.

Take the example from the problem:

Cities: 0, 8, 12, 15, 20

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0) -> City 2 (8)

- City 2 (8) -> City 3 (12)

- City 3 (12) -> City 4 (15)

- City 4 (15) -> City 3 (12)

- City 5 (20) -> City 4 (15)

Wait, hold on. According to the problem, City 4's closest city is City 3, but City 3's closest city is City 4. So, the closest relationship isn't necessarily one-way.

But in terms of travel, I can travel from any city to its closest city for 1 coin.

So, for each city, I know which city is closest to it, and I can travel to that city for 1 coin.

My task is, for each query (x, y), to find the minimum cost path from x to y using these two types of moves.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently, especially since n and m can be up to 10^5, and t (number of test cases) up to 10^4, but with the sum of n and m across all test cases being up to 10^5.

So, it's crucial to have an efficient solution, probably linear time per test case.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, for each city, I know its closest city. So, I can think of this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1.

Additionally, I can travel directly from any city to any other city with cost equal to their distance.

I need to find the minimum cost to go from x to y using these edges.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, building a graph and running Dijkstra for each query isn't feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the properties of the closest cities.

Given that the cities are on a number line and sorted in increasing order, the closest city to any city i is either i-1 or i+1, whichever is closer.

Wait, not necessarily. Consider cities at positions 0, 8, 12, 15, 20.

For city 1 (0):

- Distance to city 2 (8): 8

- Distance to city 3 (12): 12

- So, closest is city 2.

For city 2 (8):

- Distance to city 1 (0): 8

- Distance to city 3 (12): 4

- Distance to city 4 (15): 7

- So, closest is city 3.

For city 3 (12):

- Distance to city 2 (8): 4

- Distance to city 4 (15): 3

- Distance to city 5 (20): 8

- So, closest is city 4.

For city 4 (15):

- Distance to city 3 (12): 3

- Distance to city 5 (20): 5

- So, closest is city 3.

For city 5 (20):

- Distance to city 4 (15): 5

- Distance to city 3 (12): 8

- So, closest is city 4.

So, the closest cities are:

1 -> 2

2 -> 3

3 -> 4

4 -> 3

5 -> 4

Now, I can think of this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1.

Additionally, there are edges between any two cities with cost equal to their distance.

But with large n and m, building such a graph is impractical.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is cheap (1 coin), while moving directly to any city is costly (distance).

So, to minimize cost, I should use the 1-coin moves as much as possible.

But I need to get from x to y.

Let me think about what sequence of 1-coin moves can do.

Starting from x, I can move to its closest city for 1 coin.

From there, to its closest city, and so on.

Similarly, from y, I can move to its closest city for 1 coin, and so on.

But I need to find a path from x to y using these moves.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and find the shortest path in this graph.

But again, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, building such a graph and running shortest path for each query is too slow.

I need a smarter observation.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving towards the center of some cluster of cities.

But I need to think differently.

Another approach: since the cities are on a number line and sorted, the distance between consecutive cities is known.

Suppose I want to go from city x to city y.

If I go directly, it costs |a_x - a_y|.

Alternatively, I can make some number of 1-coin moves to neighboring cities and then make a direct jump.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem using the concept of "skips" where moving to the closest city is a kind of skip.

But I need a better structure.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is effectively moving to a neighbor that's closer to the target.

But in the example, moving from city 1 to city 2 costs 1 coin, then from city 2 to city 3 costs 1 coin, and so on.

But this might not always be the optimal path.

Wait, in the first query of the example:

Go from city 1 to city 4.

According to the explanation, go from 1 to 2 (1 coin), then 2 to 3 (1 coin), then 3 to 4 (1 coin), total 3 coins.

But going directly from 1 to 4 would cost |0 - 15| = 15 coins, which is worse.

Alternatively, 1 to 2 (1 coin), then 2 to 3 (1 coin), then 3 to 4 (1 coin), total 3 coins.

Alternatively, 1 to 3 directly would cost |0 - 12| = 12 coins, which is worse than 3 coins.

So, using the 1-coin moves is better.

Another query: from city 1 to city 5.

According to the explanation, use the path 1-2-3-4, then from 4 to 5 directly.

Cost: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins.

But directly from 1 to 5: |0 - 20| = 20 coins, which is worse.

Another query: from city 3 to city 4: just 1 coin, since 3's closest city is 4.

Directly: |12 - 15| = 3 coins, which is worse than 1 coin.

So, using the 1-coin move is better.

From city 3 to city 2: go from 3 to 2 via 3 to 4 (1 coin), then 4 to 3 (1 coin), then 3 to 2 (1 coin), total 3 coins.

But directly from 3 to 2: |12 - 8| = 4 coins, which is worse.

Wait, but the example says it's 4 coins, but according to this, it's 3 coins.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the example output, for query 4 (3 to 2): output is 4 coins.

But according to my calculation, it should be 3 coins.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a better path.

Let's see:

From city 3 (12):

- Move to city 4 (15) for 1 coin.

- From city 4, move to city 3 again for 1 coin.

- From city 3, move to city 2 for 1 coin.

Total: 3 coins.

But the example says 4 coins.

Wait, perhaps I misread the query.

Wait, the queries are 1-based indices.

Looking back at the example:

Input:

1

5

0 8 12 15 20

5

1 4

1 5

3 4

3 2

5 1

Output:

3

8

1

4

14

Wait, for query 4: 3 to 2, output is 4.

But according to my calculation, it should be 3.

Hmm, maybe the path is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that moving to the closest city is not always forward.

Wait, in city 4, the closest city is city 3.

So, from city 3, moving to city 4 costs 1 coin.

From city 4, moving to city 3 costs 1 coin.

Then, from city 3 to city 2 costs 1 coin.

Total: 3 coins.

But the example says 4 coins.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the example or in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the problem allows moving to the closest city only in one direction.

But no, the closest city is uniquely defined for each city.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this differently.

Let me think about the problem in terms of a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has edges to all other cities with cost equal to their distance.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, building such a graph and running Dijkstra for each query is impractical.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a chain, and that these chains can be followed.

But in the example, following the closest city moves from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, which is a chain.

Similarly, from 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1.

Wait, but city 3's closest city is city 4, and city 4's closest city is city 3.

So, it's a cycle of size 2.

Wait, but in the example, it's still possible to form a path from 1 to 4 via 2 to 3 to 4.

I need to find a way to model these moves efficiently.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving to a parent in a tree, where each city has one parent (its closest city), and then find the LCA or something similar.

But in this case, the structure isn't necessarily a tree because there might be cycles.

In the example, cities 3 and 4 point to each other, forming a cycle.

So, it's not a tree.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city, and then find the shortest path in this graph, where moving along these edges costs 1 coin, and moving directly to any city costs the distance.

But again, with large n and m, this is not efficient.

I need to find a way to exploit the structure of the number line and the fact that cities are sorted.

Let me consider that the closest city to city i is either city i-1 or city i+1, depending on which is closer.

Given that cities are sorted, a_i < a_{i+1}, so the distance between i and i+1 is a_{i+1} - a_i.

Similarly, the distance between i and i-1 is a_i - a_{i-1}.

So, for each city i, its closest city is:

- i+1 if a_{i+1} - a_i < a_i - a_{i-1}

- i-1 otherwise

Except for city 1 and city n, which only have one option.

Wait, but in the example, city 1 (0) has city 2 (8) as its closest city, which makes sense since 8 - 0 = 8, and there's no city before city 1.

City 2 (8) has city 3 (12) as its closest city, since 12 - 8 = 4, which is less than 8 - 0 = 8.

City 3 (12) has city 4 (15) as its closest city, since 15 - 12 = 3, which is less than 12 - 8 = 4.

City 4 (15) has city 3 (12) as its closest city, since 15 - 12 = 3, which is less than 20 - 15 = 5.

City 5 (20) has city 4 (15) as its closest city, since 20 - 15 = 5, which is less than infinity (no city after it).

So, in this case, the closest city for each is either the previous or the next city, depending on which is closer.

Hence, for each city i, its closest city is:

- If i = 1: city 2

- If i = n: city n-1

- Else: city i+1 if a_{i+1} - a_i < a_i - a_{i-1}, else city i-1

This seems correct.

So, for each city, I can precompute its closest city.

Now, I need to find a way to use this information to compute the minimal cost to go from x to y.

Let me think about the properties of these closest city moves.

If I keep moving to the closest city, I might end up oscillating between two cities if they are mutually closest to each other, like cities 3 and 4 in the example.

But in that case, I can consider that moving from 3 to 4 costs 1 coin, and from 4 to 3 costs 1 coin, and so on.

But I need to get from x to y in the minimal number of coins.

I need to find a way to model this efficiently.

An idea: precompute for each city, the sequence of cities I reach by repeatedly moving to the closest city, and the cost of reaching each in the sequence.

But this might not be straightforward.

Another idea: since moving to the closest city is cheap (1 coin), and moving directly is costly (distance), I should try to use as many 1-coin moves as possible.

In other words, I should try to follow the chain of closest cities to get from x to y.

But in some cases, it might be better to make a direct jump at some point.

I need to find the optimal combination.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city, the minimal cost to reach any other city by following the closest city chain.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step towards the target, but in a cheaper way.

But I need to formalize this.

Another angle: since the cities are on a number line, and sorted, I can think of the problem in terms of distances.

The minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimum between:

- The direct distance |a_x - a_y|

- The cost of moving to the closest city of x, then recursively finding the minimal cost from there to y, plus 1.

But this recursive approach is too slow for large n and m.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider precomputing for each city, the minimal cost to reach it from any other city.

But that seems too broad.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has edges to all other cities with cost equal to their distance.

Then, the minimal cost to go from x to y is the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But again, building such a graph is not feasible for large n and m.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost path from x to y consists of a sequence of moves to closest cities, possibly interspersed with direct jumps.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

An idea: precompute for each city, the minimal cost to reach it from the leftmost city and from the rightmost city.

Then, for any query (x, y), the minimal cost would be the minimal over:

- Cost from x to the leftmost city, plus cost from leftmost to y

- Cost from x to the rightmost city, plus cost from rightmost to y

But I need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where cities are connected in a chain via their closest cities, and then compute prefix sums of costs along this chain.

Let me think about this.

In the example:

Cities: 0, 8, 12, 15, 20

Closest cities:

1 -> 2

2 -> 3

3 -> 4

4 -> 3

5 -> 4

So, cities 3 and 4 are mutually closest.

If I start from city 1 and keep moving to the closest city:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> ...

It oscillates between 3 and 4.

Similarly, starting from city 5:

5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> ...

Again, oscillating between 3 and 4.

So, there seems to be a cycle between cities 3 and 4.

This suggests that moving via closest cities can lead to cycles.

Hence, the graph might have cycles, making it not a tree.

This complicates finding shortest paths.

I need to find a way to handle this efficiently.

Another idea: since moving to the closest city costs 1 coin, and moving directly costs the distance, I can think of the minimal cost as the minimal number of 1-coin moves plus the cost of a direct jump at some point.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has edges to all other cities with cost equal to their distance.

Then, the minimal cost to go from x to y is the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But again, with large n and m, this is not practical.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step closer to the target, but in reality, it might not always be the case.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of 1-coin moves needed to bring x and y closer together.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand how it works.

Given the reference solution:

- It reads t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads n and the list of cities.

- Computes forward_cities using func_1(cities, n).

- Reverses the cities list and computes backward_cities using func_1.

- Computes prefix sums for forward_cities and backward_cities.

- Reads m queries and for each query, depending on whether a < b, it computes the difference in prefix sums.

- func_1(cities, n) computes a list where each element is:

- 1 if moving to the next city is closer than to the previous one.

- Otherwise, the distance to the next city.

Wait, let's understand func_1.

In func_1:

- It initializes a list prog_cities of size n-1.

- For each city i from 0 to n-2:

- back is set to a very small number if i > 0, else -999...

- forward is set to a very large number if i < n-1, else 999...

- If the distance to forward is less than to back, prog_cities[i] = 1, else it's the distance to forward.

Wait, in code:

back = -99999999999999999999

forward = 999999999999999999

if i > 0:

back = cities[i - 1]

if i < n - 1:

forward = cities[i + 1]

if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):

prog_cities[i] = 1

else:

prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])

So, for each city i (from 0 to n-2):

- It compares the distance to the next city (forward) and to the previous city (back).

- If moving forward is closer, prog_cities[i] = 1.

- Else, prog_cities[i] = distance to forward.

Then, it computes prefix sums for forward_cities and backward_cities.

Then, for each query (a, b), if a < b, it computes pref_sum_f[b-1] - pref_sum_f[a-1], else pref_sum_b[b-1] - pref_sum_b[a-1].

Wait, this seems like it's computing the minimal cost by moving from a to b via some path using 1-coin moves and direct jumps.

But I need to verify if this is correct.

Let me try to understand the logic.

First, it computes for each city i (from 1 to n-1), whether moving to i+1 is closer than to i-1.

If moving to i+1 is closer, then prog_cities[i] = 1, else prog_cities[i] = distance to i+1.

Then, it computes prefix sums of these values.

So, pref_sum_f[i] = sum of prog_cities[0 to i-1]

Similarly for backward_cities.

Then, for a query (a, b), if a < b, it computes pref_sum_f[b-1] - pref_sum_f[a-1], which is effectively sum of prog_cities from a to b-1.

Similarly for a > b, it uses backward_cities.

I need to see if this correctly computes the minimal cost.

Let's take the example:

Cities: 0, 8, 12, 15, 20

Compute forward_cities:

For city 1 (0):

forward = 8, back = -999... so forward is closer, prog_cities[0] = 1

For city 2 (8):

forward = 12, back = 0

Distance to forward: 4, to back: 8

4 < 8, so prog_cities[1] = 1

For city 3 (12):

forward = 15, back = 8

Distance to forward: 3, to back: 4

3 < 4, so prog_cities[2] = 1

For city 4 (15):

forward = 20, back = 12

Distance to forward: 5, to back: 3

5 > 3, so prog_cities[3] = 5

So, forward_cities = [1, 1, 1, 5]

Then, pref_sum_f = [0, 1, 2, 3, 8]

Similarly, reversing cities: 20, 15, 12, 8, 0

Compute backward_cities:

For city 5 (20):

back = 15, forward = 999... so back is closer, prog_cities[0] = 5 (distance to 15)

For city 4 (15):

back = 12, forward = 20

Distance to back: 3, to forward: 5

3 < 5, so prog_cities[1] = 1

For city 3 (12):

back = 8, forward = 15

Distance to back: 4, to forward: 3

4 > 3, so prog_cities[2] = 3

For city 2 (8):

back = 0, forward = 12

Distance to back: 8, to forward: 4

8 > 4, so prog_cities[3] = 4

So, backward_cities = [5,1,3,4]

pref_sum_b = [0, 5, 6, 9, 13]

Then, for query 1 to 4 (a=1, b=4):

Since a < b, pref_sum_f[3] - pref_sum_f[0] = 3 - 0 = 3, which matches the example.

For query 1 to 5 (a=1, b=5):

a < b, pref_sum_f[4] - pref_sum_f[0] = 8 - 0 = 8, matches the example.

For query 3 to 4 (a=3, b=4):

a < b, pref_sum_f[3] - pref_sum_f[2] = 3 - 2 = 1, matches the example.

For query 3 to 2 (a=3, b=2):

a > b, pref_sum_b[1] - pref_sum_b[2] = 5 - 6 = -1, but cost can't be negative, so maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, indices are 1-based.

Let's see:

For query 3 to 2:

a=3, b=2

a > b, so use pref_sum_b[b-1] - pref_sum_b[a-1] = pref_sum_b[1] - pref_sum_b[2] = 5 - 6 = -1

But cost can't be negative, so perhaps I'm miscomputing the indices.

Wait, in the code:

pref_sum_b = [0]

pref_sum_b.append(pref_sum_b[i] + backward_cities[i])

for i in range(n - 1)

Then, for a > b, print(pref_sum_b[b - 1] - pref_sum_b[a - 1])

But in the example, for query 3 to 2, it should be 4 coins, but according to this, it's -1, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in how pref_sum_b is constructed or used.

Wait, in the code:

cities.reverse()

backward_cities = func_1(cities, n)

pref_sum_b = [0]

for i in range(n - 1):

pref_sum_b.append(pref_sum_b[i] + backward_cities[i])

pref_sum_b.reverse()

Wait, why reverse pref_sum_b?

Wait, perhaps to align the indices correctly after reversing the cities.

But it's getting complicated.

I need to verify if this approach correctly computes the minimal cost.

In the example, for query 3 to 2, the minimal cost is 4 coins, but according to this method, it's giving -1, which is incorrect.

Hence, this approach seems flawed.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
