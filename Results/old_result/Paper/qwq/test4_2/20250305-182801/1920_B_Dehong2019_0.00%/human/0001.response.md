Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some changes to it in two steps.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the sum will be if both play optimally.

Okay, so let's break this down. Alice goes first, and she can remove up to k elements. She wants to maximize the sum, so she should remove the smallest elements, right? Wait, no. Actually, it's a bit tricky because Bob will then get to flip some signs to minimize the sum.

Let me think differently. Since Bob gets to flip up to x elements to negative, Alice needs to anticipate that. So, perhaps Alice should remove elements in such a way that minimizes the impact of Bob's moves.

Wait, maybe I should consider the final sum after both players have made their moves. The sum will be the sum of the remaining elements, with up to x of them negated by Bob.

So, if Alice removes k elements, then there are n - k elements left. Bob can then choose up to x of these to negate. To minimize the sum, Bob would negate the largest positive elements among the remaining ones.

Therefore, to maximize the sum against Bob's moves, Alice should remove the elements that Bob would most want to negate. That is, Alice should remove the largest elements that Bob would negate.

Wait, that seems a bit contradictory. Let me think again.

Suppose Alice removes the smallest elements. Then, the remaining elements are the largest ones. Bob would then negate the largest among these to minimize the sum.

Alternatively, if Alice removes some larger elements, perhaps she can force Bob to negate smaller elements.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at the example to get some insight.

In the second test case:

n=4, k=1, x=1

a = [3,1,2,4]

Sorted in reverse: [4,3,2,1]

Alice can remove one element. If she removes 1, the remaining are [4,3,2]. Bob can negate one element; he'll negate 4, so sum is 3 + 2 -4 = 1.

If Alice removes 2, remaining are [4,3,1]. Bob negates 4: 3 +1 -4 = 0.

If Alice removes 3, remaining are [4,2,1]. Bob negates 4: 2 +1 -4 = -1.

If Alice removes 4, remaining are [3,2,1]. Bob negates 3: 2 +1 -3 = 0.

So, the best for Alice is to not remove any, and the sum is 3+1+2+4=10, and Bob can negate 4 to make it 3+1+2-4=2.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 2.

Okay, so in this case, Alice chooses not to remove any elements, and Bob negates one element, choosing the largest one, which is 4.

So, the sum is 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.

In the first test case:

n=1, k=1, x=1

a=[1]

Alice removes the only element, so the sum is 0.

In the third test case:

n=6, k=6, x=3

a=[1,4,3,2,5,6]

Alice can remove up to 6 elements, so she can remove all of them, sum is 0.

In the fourth test case:

n=6, k=6, x=1

a=[3,7,3,3,32,15]

Similarly, Alice can remove all, sum is 0.

Wait, but in the output, it's 3. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let's look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

8

1 1 1

1

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

6 6 3

1 4 3 2 5 6

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

10 6 4

1 8 2 9 3 3 4 5 3 200

2 2 1

4 3

2 1 2

1 3

Sample Output:

0

2

0

3

-5

-9

0

-1

Okay, so for the fourth test case, the output is 3.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output. Let's match them:

First test case: 1 1 1 -> 1 element, remove 1, sum is 0. Output: 0

Second test case: 4 1 1 -> 4 elements, remove 1, sum is 2. Output: 2

Third test case: 6 6 3 -> can remove all, sum is 0. Output: 0

Fourth test case: 6 6 1 -> can remove all, sum is 0, but output is 3. Wait, maybe I need to read the input more carefully.

Wait, the fourth test case is:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

So, n=6, k=6, x=1

Alice can remove up to 6 elements. If she removes all, sum is 0.

But the output is 3. So, perhaps it's better for Alice not to remove all elements.

Wait, maybe there's a better strategy.

If Alice removes 32, which is the largest element, then the remaining are [15,7,3,3,3]. Bob can negate one element; he'll negate 15, so sum is 7 +3 +3 +3 -15 = -2.

If Alice removes 15, remaining are [32,7,3,3,3]. Bob negates 32: 7 +3 +3 +3 -32 = -16.

If Alice removes one 3, remaining are [32,7,3,3,15]. Bob negates 32: 7 +3 +3 +15 -32 = -4.

If Alice removes another 3, remaining are [32,7,3,15]. Bob negates 32: 7 +3 +15 -32 = -7.

If Alice removes 7, remaining are [32,3,15]. Bob negates 32: 3 +15 -32 = -14.

If Alice removes 32, remaining are [7,3,15]. Bob negates 15: 7 +3 -15 = -5.

So, the best for Alice is to remove 32, and sum is -5, but the sample output is 3. Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, maybe I misread the input.

Wait, no, the fourth test case is:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

So, n=6, k=6, x=1

Alice can remove up to 6 elements.

If she removes 32, the largest, then remaining are [15,7,3,3,3]. Bob negates 15: sum is 7 +3 +3 +3 -15 = -2.

Alternatively, if Alice removes 15, remaining are [32,7,3,3,3]. Bob negates 32: 7 +3 +3 +3 -32 = -16.

So, better to remove 32 and get -2, but the sample output is 3. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Alice can choose to remove fewer than k elements.

Wait, in this case, k=6, so she can remove up to 6, but perhaps it's better to remove fewer.

If she removes 0 elements, sum is 3+7+3+3+32+15=63. Bob negates 32: 3+7+3+3+15-32=8.

If she removes 1 element, say 32, sum is 3+7+3+3+15=31. Bob negates 15: 3+7+3+3-15=1.

If she removes 15, sum is 3+7+3+3+32=48. Bob negates 32: 3+7+3+3-32=-16.

So, better to remove 32 and get -2.

Wait, but sample output is 3. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample output explanation.

Wait, maybe I should look at the problem again.

"Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both players play optimally."

So, both play optimally.

In the fourth test case, the output is 3.

Wait, perhaps Alice removes one of the 3's, say the first one, then remaining are [7,3,3,32,15]. Bob negates 32: 7 +3 +3 +15 -32 = 3.

That gives sum 3, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, Alice removes one 3, and Bob negates 32 to get sum 3.

Indeed, that's better than removing 32 and getting -2, or removing 15 and getting -16.

So, Alice has to choose how many to remove, up to k, to maximize the sum after Bob negates up to x elements.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to think of a general strategy.

First, Alice removes up to k elements to maximize the sum after Bob negates up to x elements.

So, after Alice removes k elements, there are n - k elements left.

Bob will negate the x largest remaining elements (since negating larger positives will reduce the sum more).

Therefore, to maximize the sum, Alice should remove the elements that Bob would want to negate.

That is, Alice should remove the x largest elements, so that Bob cannot negate them.

But, if k is larger than x, she can remove more, but she should remove the smallest ones, to keep the larger ones positive.

Wait, no.

Wait, if Alice removes the x largest elements, then Bob cannot negate them, but the remaining elements are smaller ones, which when negated, would have less impact on the sum.

But, Bob can only negate up to x elements, but since Alice has removed x largest, Bob can negate the next x largest.

Wait, no, Bob can negate up to x elements from the remaining n - k elements.

So, perhaps it's better for Alice to remove the elements that would be most beneficial for Bob to negate.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me consider different approaches.

One approach is to sort the array in descending order.

Then, the largest elements are first.

Alice can choose to remove up to k elements from these.

Bob will then negate up to x elements from the remaining.

So, to maximize the sum, Alice should remove the elements that Bob would negate, i.e., the first x elements after her removal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of choosing which elements to keep.

Alice chooses n - k elements to keep.

Then, Bob negates up to x of them.

To maximize the sum, Alice wants to keep elements such that after Bob negates x of them, the sum is maximized.

This sounds like selecting n - k elements, and then negating the smallest x of them.

Wait, no, Bob will negate the largest x to minimize the sum.

Wait, no, Bob will negate the largest x positive elements to minimize the sum.

So, Alice wants to select n - k elements such that the sum is maximized after Bob negates the largest x positive elements among them.

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I should look at the provided code and see what it's doing.

The function is defined as func(), and it's reading input for multiple test cases.

For each test case, it reads n, k, x, and then reads the array a, sorts it in descending order.

Then, it calculates ans1 as the sum of the array.

Then, it subtracts a[i]*2 for the first x elements, which seems like negating them.

Then, it sets ans2 to ans1.

Then, there's a loop for i in range(k), where it adds a[i] back (since it was removed), and subtracts a[i+x]*2.

Finally, it takes the maximum of ans1 and ans2 and prints it.

Wait, this seems off.

Wait, let's see.

It sorts the array in descending order.

So, a[0] is the largest.

ans1 is the sum of all elements.

Then, it subtracts a[i]*2 for i in range(x), which is equivalent to negating the largest x elements.

Then, it sets ans2 to ans1.

Then, it enters a loop for i in range(k):

ans1 += a[i]  # adding back the i-th largest element that was presumably removed

if i + x < n:

ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2  # negating the (i+x)-th element

Then, ans = max(ans1, ans2)

Wait, this seems like it's trying to simulate removing k elements and negating x elements from the remaining.

But, I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.

Let me try to see with the second test case.

n=4, k=1, x=1

a = [4,3,2,1]

ans1 = 4+3+2+1=10

subtract a[0]*2=8, so ans1=2

ans2=2

Then, loop for i in range(1):

ans1 += a[0]=4+2=6

if 1+1=2 <4, ans1 -= a[2]*2=2*2=4, so ans1=6-4=2

Then, ans=max(2,2)=2, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case:

n=6, k=6, x=1

a=[7,15,32,3,3,3]

Wait, sorted descending: [32,15,7,3,3,3]

ans1=32+15+7+3+3+3=63

subtract a[0]*2=64, ans1=63-64=-1

ans2=-1

Then, loop for i in range(6):

i=0: ans1 += a[0]=32, ans1=-1+32=31

if 0+1=1 <6, ans1 -= a[1]*2=15*2=30, ans1=31-30=1

i=1: ans1 += a[1]=15, ans1=1+15=16

if 1+1=2 <6, ans1 -= a[2]*2=7*2=14, ans1=16-14=2

i=2: ans1 += a[2]=7, ans1=2+7=9

if 2+1=3 <6, ans1 -= a[3]*2=3*2=6, ans1=9-6=3

i=3: ans1 += a[3]=3, ans1=3+3=6

if 3+1=4 <6, ans1 -= a[4]*2=3*2=6, ans1=6-6=0

i=4: ans1 += a[4]=3, ans1=0+3=3

if 4+1=5 <6, ans1 -= a[5]*2=3*2=6, ans1=3-6=-3

i=5: ans1 += a[5]=3, ans1=-3+3=0

Then, ans=max(0, -1)=0, but the sample output is 3.

Hmm, so it's not matching the sample output.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Looking back, in the fourth test case, the correct output should be 3, but according to this code, it's 0.

Wait, but in my earlier manual calculation, I saw that removing one 3 and negating 32 gives sum 3.

But according to the code, in the last iteration, ans1 is 0, and ans2 is -1, so max is 0.

So, it's not matching the sample output.

Therefore, this code is incorrect.

Wait, but the sample output is 3, but according to this code, it's 0.

So, Correctness: False

But the question is to determine if the given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided sample.

Since it doesn't match the sample output, it's incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
