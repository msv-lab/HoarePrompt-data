Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has some cubes and he wants to build a tower using these cubes. He can perform two kinds of moves: either add one cube to the top of the tower or remove one cube from the top. He can do this for a total of n moves, and we need to figure out if it's possible that after these n moves, the tower has exactly m cubes.

First, I need to understand the operations he can perform. Each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube from the top. So, starting from zero cubes, if he adds a cube, the tower has one cube, then if he adds another, it has two, and so on. If he removes a cube, he takes one off the top, so the tower gets smaller by one cube.

I need to consider the sequence of these operations. The order in which he adds or removes cubes matters because removing a cube when there are none is probably not allowed, but according to the problem, he can only remove from the top, so I assume he won't try to remove a cube when there are none. So, he has to have at least one cube to remove one.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says he can perform these operations in any order, and we need to check if after n moves, the tower has exactly m cubes.

Let me think about this in terms of the net effect of the operations. Each add operation increases the number of cubes by one, and each remove operation decreases it by one. So, if he does x add operations and y remove operations, with x + y = n, and the final number of cubes is x - y = m.

So, we have two equations:

1. x + y = n

2. x - y = m

I can solve these equations for x and y.

Adding both equations: 2x = n + m => x = (n + m)/2

Subtracting the second equation from the first: 2y = n - m => y = (n - m)/2

Now, since x and y have to be non-negative integers (because you can't have a fraction of a move), the solutions x and y must satisfy:

1. x >= 0

2. y >= 0

3. x and y are integers

So, for x and y to be integers, (n + m) must be even, and (n - m) must be even, because they are divided by 2.

Wait, actually, since x = (n + m)/2 and y = (n - m)/2, both x and y will be integers only if n + m is even and n - m is even.

But note that n and m are both integers, so n + m and n - m are both even if n and m are both even or both odd.

Wait, more precisely:

- If n and m are both even, then n + m is even, and n - m is even.

- If n and m are both odd, then n + m is even, and n - m is even.

- If one is even and the other is odd, then n + m is odd, and n - m is odd.

So, x and y are integers only if n and m are both even or both odd.

But there's more to it. We also need to ensure that x and y are non-negative.

So, x = (n + m)/2 >= 0

And y = (n - m)/2 >= 0

Since n and m are both positive integers, and n >= m (because y cannot be negative), so n >= m.

Wait, no, y = (n - m)/2 >= 0 implies n >= m.

But in the problem, m can be less than n.

Wait, but m is the final number of cubes, which can be less than, equal to, or greater than n, but considering that he starts from zero cubes, he can't have more cubes than the number of add operations he performed.

Wait, but he can add and remove cubes in any order.

Wait, but if he removes a cube, he has to have one to remove.

So, in practice, the sequence matters.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the maximum and minimum possible number of cubes after n moves.

- The maximum number of cubes he can have is if he adds a cube in every move: x = n, y = 0.

- The minimum number of cubes he can have is if he adds a cube and then removes it alternately, but he can't remove more than he has.

Wait, actually, if he adds a cube and then removes it, it's like doing nothing.

Wait, but in terms of the net effect, it's x - y = m.

And x + y = n.

So, as I had earlier, x = (n + m)/2 and y = (n - m)/2.

Now, for x and y to be integers, n + m must be even, and n - m must be even, which is true when n and m are both even or both odd.

Additionally, y must be less than or equal to x, because he can't remove more cubes than he has.

Wait, y <= x, because he can't remove more cubes than he has added.

But from x = (n + m)/2 and y = (n - m)/2, and n >= m (since y >= 0), we have that y <= x is equivalent to (n - m)/2 <= (n + m)/2, which simplifies to n - m <= n + m, which is always true since m >= 0.

So, y <= x is always true in this context.

Therefore, the main conditions are:

1. n >= m

2. n and m are both even or both odd.

But wait, in the earlier example:

- 3 moves, m = 3: possible with x = 3, y = 0.

- 2 moves, m = 4: not possible, since n < m.

- 5 moves, m = 3: possible with x = 4, y = 1.

Wait, but according to n >= m, in the third case, 5 >= 3, and both are odd, so it should be possible.

Wait, but in the second case, 2 < 4, so not possible.

In the first case, 3 >= 3 and both odd, possible.

Wait, but in the third case, n = 5, m = 3, both odd, possible.

So, seems like the condition is n >= m and n and m are both even or both odd.

Wait, but in the third case, n = 5 (odd), m = 3 (odd), which satisfies both conditions.

In the second case, n = 2 (even), m = 4 (even), but n < m, so not possible.

Wait, but according to the condition, n >= m and both even or both odd.

Wait, but in the second case, n = 2, m = 4, both even, but n < m, so "No".

In the first case, n = 3, m = 3, both odd, n >= m, "Yes".

In the third case, n = 5, m = 3, both odd, n >= m, "Yes".

So, the condition seems to hold.

But let's verify with another example.

Suppose n = 4, m = 2: both even, n >= m, should be possible.

Indeed, x = (4 + 2)/2 = 3, y = (4 - 2)/2 = 1.

So, add 3 times, remove 1 time: total cubes = 3 - 1 = 2.

So, "Yes".

Another example: n = 4, m = 3.

n = 4 (even), m = 3 (odd): different parity, should be "No".

Indeed, x = (4 + 3)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5, not integer.

So, "No".

Another example: n = 5, m = 2.

n = 5 (odd), m = 2 (even): different parity, "No".

x = (5 + 2)/2 = 3.5, not integer.

So, "No".

Another example: n = 1, m = 1.

n = 1 (odd), m = 1 (odd): same parity, n >= m, "Yes".

Indeed, add one cube: x = 1, y = 0.

So, "Yes".

Another example: n = 1, m = 0.

n = 1 (odd), m = 0 (even): different parity, "No".

But according to x and y: x = (1 + 0)/2 = 0.5, not integer.

So, "No".

Wait, but in reality, if n = 1, m = 0: he adds one cube, then removes one cube, but he can't do two moves with n = 1.

Wait, n = 1, he can either add one cube or remove one cube.

But starting from zero, he can't remove a cube, so only option is to add one cube, resulting in m = 1.

So, m = 0 is not possible with n = 1.

Hence, "No".

So, the condition seems consistent.

Therefore, the program should check:

- If n >= m and n and m are both even or both odd, then "Yes", else "No".

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(b, c) = map(int, input().split())

q = (b, c)

if b == c:

print('YES')

elif b < c:

print('NO')

elif b % 2 == c % 2:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

So, it first reads the number of test cases, a.

Then, for each test case, it reads b and c (which are n and m in my earlier notation).

Then, it checks:

- If b == c, print 'YES'

- Elif b < c, print 'NO'

- Elif b % 2 == c % 2, print 'Yes'

- Else, print 'No'

Comparing this with my earlier analysis:

- If n == m, then "Yes" (since n >= m and both have the same parity).

- If n < m, then "No" (since n < m, doesn't satisfy n >= m).

- If n > m and n and m have the same parity, then "Yes".

- Else, "No".

Which matches the condition I derived: n >= m and n and m have the same parity.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Looking back at the example:

Input:

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

Output:

Yes

No

Yes

As per the program:

- 3 == 3, so 'YES'

- 2 < 4, so 'NO'

- 5 > 3 and 5 % 2 == 3 % 2 (both odd), so 'Yes'

Which matches the expected output.

Another test case I thought about:

n = 4, m = 2: 4 > 2 and both even, so 'Yes'

n = 4, m = 3: 4 > 3 but 4 even, 3 odd, so 'No'

n = 5, m = 2: 5 > 2 but 5 odd, 2 even, so 'No'

n = 1, m = 1: 1 == 1, so 'YES'

n = 1, m = 0: 1 > 0 but 1 odd, 0 even, so 'No'

All these align with the program's logic.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
