Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f (indexed from 1 to n). He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows some value a_i. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order of their values, meaning from largest to smallest. If two cubes have the same value, their order relative to each other can be anything.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is removed or not.

Looking at the example:

n=5, f=2, k=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3]

After sorting, it could be [4,3,3,3,2] or [4,3,3,2,3], etc., depending on how the same values are ordered.

If it's [4,3,3,3,2], the first two removed are 4 and 3. The favorite cube was originally at position 2, which had value 3. In this sorted list, it's in position 2, so it's removed.

If it's [4,3,3,2,3], again, first two removed are 4 and 3. The favorite cube is still value 3, and it's in position 2, so it's removed.

Wait, in the problem description, it says:

"After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2], since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed.

After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2], since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed."

Wait, but in both cases, the favorite cube has value 3, and in both sorted arrays, the first two cubes are 4 and 3. So in both cases, it should be removed.

But the problem says that in the second case, it's not removed. Maybe I misread.

Wait, the problem says:

"After sorting a=[4,3,3,3,2], since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed."

Wait, but if k=2, and we remove the first two cubes, the third one should stay. Oh, but the favorite cube has value 3, which is also in the second position, which is removed.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

I need to determine, after sorting the cubes in non-increasing order, whether the favorite cube is among the first k cubes removed.

Since the sorting is non-increasing, the largest values are first.

If there are multiple cubes with the same value, their order relative to each other is unspecified.

So, to determine if the favorite cube is removed, I need to see where it could end up in the sorted list.

If its value is unique, then its position in the sorted list is determined.

But if its value is the same as others, its position could vary.

So, I need to consider the possible positions of the favorite cube after sorting.

I need to check if, in all possible sorted arrays, the favorite cube is among the first k, or in none of them, or in some but not all.

So, the output should be:

- "YES" if, in all possible sorted arrays, the favorite cube is among the first k.

- "NO" if, in none of the possible sorted arrays, the favorite cube is among the first k.

- "MAYBE" if, in some sorted arrays, it is among the first k, and in others, it is not.

So, I need to consider all possible ways the cubes with the same value can be ordered among themselves.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to sort the cubes in non-increasing order, with the condition that cubes with the same value can be in any order relative to each other.

So, the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list depends on its value and the values of other cubes.

If its value is higher than the k-th highest value, then it will always be among the first k.

If its value is lower than the k-th highest value, then it will never be among the first k.

If its value is equal to the k-th highest value, then it depends on how the cubes with that value are ordered among themselves.

So, I need to find the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list, considering the possible variations in ordering of cubes with the same value.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- Let v = a[f], the value of the favorite cube.

- Let s be the sorted list in non-increasing order.

- Let p be the position of the favorite cube in s.

Now, p can vary depending on how cubes with the same value as v are ordered among themselves.

I need to find the possible range of p.

If the smallest possible p is still <=k, then in all cases, the favorite cube is removed.

If the largest possible p is still >k, then in no cases is it removed.

Otherwise, it's maybe.

So, I need to find the minimal possible p and the maximal possible p.

Given that cubes with the same value can be in any order, the favorite cube can be placed anywhere among the cubes with the same value.

So, to find the minimal possible p, I need to place the favorite cube as early as possible among the cubes with value v.

To find the maximal possible p, I need to place it as late as possible.

So, first, I need to sort the cubes in non-increasing order, and find the positions where v is located.

Wait, more precisely:

- Sort all cubes except the favorite one.

- Then, insert the favorite cube among the cubes with value v, in the earliest or latest possible position.

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

- Count how many cubes have value greater than v.

- Count how many cubes have value equal to v.

Then, the minimal possible p is the number of cubes with value > v + 1.

The maximal possible p is the number of cubes with value > v + the number of cubes with value == v.

Because, in the sorted list, the cubes with value > v come first, then the cubes with value == v.

Within the cubes with value == v, the favorite cube can be anywhere.

So, if the minimal p <=k and maximal p <=k, then YES.

If maximal p <=k, then YES.

Wait, no.

Wait, if minimal p <=k and maximal p <=k, then in all cases, p <=k, so YES.

If minimal p >k, then in all cases, p >k, so NO.

Otherwise, MAYBE.

Wait, let me think.

Suppose:

- Number of cubes with value > v is m.

- Number of cubes with value == v is c.

Then, the favorite cube can be placed from position m+1 to m+c.

If m+1 <=k, and m+c <=k, then in all possible positions, p <=k, so YES.

If m+c <=k, then YES.

Wait, no.

Wait, if m >=k, then all first k are > v, so the favorite cube is not among the first k.

Wait, wait.

Wait, if m >=k, then the first k are all > v, so the favorite cube is not removed.

If m <k, then some of the first k are == v.

So, if m <k, then the favorite cube could be among the first k or not, depending on its position among the c cubes with value == v.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the index.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, read t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, f, k.

- Read the array a of n integers.

- f is 1-based index, so convert to 0-based for programming.

- Find v = a[f].

- Count m = number of cubes with value > v.

- Count c = number of cubes with value == v.

- The favorite cube can be placed from position m+1 to m+c.

- If m+1 >k, then in all cases, p >k, so NO.

- If m+c <=k, then in all cases, p <=k, so YES.

- Else, it's MAYBE.

Wait, but in the problem, k is 1-based, and the positions are 1-based.

So, positions are from 1 to n.

We need to remove the first k cubes.

So, if the favorite cube is in position <=k, it's removed.

Else, it's not removed.

So, in terms of indices:

- Positions 1 to k are removed.

So, if p <=k, removed.

Else, not removed.

So, as I thought earlier.

So, in code, I need to:

- Calculate m: number of cubes with a[i] > v.

- Calculate c: number of cubes with a[i] == v.

- Then, the favorite cube can be placed from position m+1 to m+c.

- If m+1 >k, then p >k in all cases, so NO.

- If m+c <=k, then p <=k in all cases, so YES.

- Else, p could be <=k or >k, so MAYBE.

This seems correct.

Let me test this logic with the example given.

Example 1:

n=5, f=2, k=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3]

v = a[2-1] = a[1] = 3

m = number of cubes with a[i] >3: only 4, so m=1

c = number of cubes with a[i]==3: three cubes.

So, favorite cube can be placed from position m+1=2 to m+c=4.

k=2.

So, positions 2 to 4.

If p=2, which is <=k=2, removed.

If p=3 or 4, which are >k=2, not removed.

So, it's possible that it's removed or not, so MAYBE.

Which matches the sample output.

Example 2:

n=5, f=5, k=3, a=[4,2,1,3,5]

v = a[5-1]=a[4]=3

m = number of cubes with a[i]>3: 4 and 5, so m=2

c = number of cubes with a[i]==3: one cube.

So, favorite cube can be placed from position m+1=3 to m+c=3.

k=3.

So, p=3 <=k=3, so YES.

Which matches the sample output.

Example 3:

n=5, f=5, k=2, a=[5,2,4,1,3]

v=3

m=number of cubes with a[i]>3: 5 and 4, so m=2

c=1

p=m+1=3

k=2

p=3 >k=2, so NO.

Which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Let me see another example.

Example 4:

n=5, f=5, k=5, a=[1,2,5,4,3]

v=3

m=number of cubes with a[i]>3:5 and4, m=2

c=1

p=m+1=3 <=k=5, so YES.

Matches sample output.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=4, a=[3,1,2,4,5]

v=5

m=number of cubes with a[i]>5: none, m=0

c=1

p=m+1=1 <=k=4, so YES.

Matches sample output.

Another one:

n=5, f=5, k=5, a=[4,3,2,1,5]

v=5

m=0

c=1

p=1 <=k=5, so YES.

Matches sample output.

Next:

n=6, f=5, k=3, a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

v=2

m=number of cubes with a[i]>2:3,3, so m=2

c=number of cubes with a[i]==2:2,2, so c=2

So, p can be from m+1=3 to m+c=4.

k=3.

If p=3 <=k=3, removed.

If p=4 >k=3, not removed.

So, MAYBE.

Matches sample output.

Another one:

n=10, f=1, k=1, a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

v=1

m=0

c=10

p from 1 to 10.

k=1.

If p=1 <=k=1, removed.

If p=2 to 10 >k=1, not removed.

So, MAYBE.

Matches sample output.

Another one:

n=1, f=1, k=1, a=[42]

v=42

m=0

c=1

p=1 <=k=1, so YES.

Matches sample output.

Another one:

n=5, f=2, k=3, a=[2,2,1,1,2]

v=2

m=0

c=4 (since there are four 2's)

p from 1 to 4.

k=3.

If p=1,2,3 <=k=3, removed.

If p=4 >k=3, not removed.

So, MAYBE.

Matches sample output.

Another one:

n=2, f=1, k=1, a=[2,1]

v=2

m=0

c=1

p=1 <=k=1, so YES.

Matches sample output.

Another one:

n=5, f=3, k=1, a=[3,3,2,3,2]

v=2

m=number of cubes with a[i]>2:3,3,3, so m=3

c=2 (two cubes with value 2)

p from m+1=4 to m+c=5.

k=1.

So, p >=4 >k=1, so not removed.

But wait, in the sample output, it's NO.

But according to this, it should be NO.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's "YES", which seems incorrect.

Wait, no, wait, the sample output for this test case is "NO", which matches my conclusion.

So, all sample test cases match this logic.

Therefore, this logic seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

f -= 1

k -= 1

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

x = a[f]

a.sort(reverse=True)

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Wait, this seems different from what I thought.

In my logic, I had:

- Calculate m: number of cubes with a[i] > x.

- Calculate c: number of cubes with a[i] == x.

- If m+1 >k, then NO.

- If m+c <=k, then YES.

- Else, MAYBE.

But in this code, it sorts the array in descending order and then checks:

- If a[k] > x: NO

- If a[k] < x: YES

- Else: YES if k == n-1 or a[k+1] < x else MAYBE

Wait, let's see.

In the sorted array, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest value.

If a[k] > x, that means the k-th largest value is greater than x, so all the first k cubes have values greater than x, including position k.

So, the favorite cube, with value x, is not among the first k, so NOT removed.

Hence, "NO".

If a[k] < x, that means the k-th largest value is less than x, so the favorite cube, with value x, is among the first k, because its value is higher than the k-th largest.

Wait, no.

Wait, if a[k] < x, that means that the (k+1)-th largest value is less than x, so the first k values are all greater than or equal to x.

Wait, but in this case, the favorite cube could be among the first k or not.

Wait, this seems different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, maybe I need to understand this code better.

Let me think.

In the sorted array in descending order:

- Positions 0 to k-1 are the first k cubes to be removed.

- The k-th position is the last one to be removed.

So, if a[k] > x, then all the first k cubes have values greater than x, so the favorite cube is not among them.

Hence, "NO".

If a[k] < x, then the favorite cube, having a value greater than a[k], must be among the first k cubes, so "YES".

If a[k] == x, then it depends.

In this case, the code checks:

- If k == n-1, meaning that k is the last position, so the favorite cube is among the first k.

- Or, if a[k+1] < x, which would mean that a[k] == x and a[k+1] < x, so all cubes after k have values less than x, meaning that the favorite cube is among the first k.

Else, it's "MAYBE".

Wait, this seems similar to my logic, but formulated differently.

In my logic, m is the number of cubes with a[i] > x.

c is the number of cubes with a[i] == x.

Then, p, the position of the favorite cube, can be from m+1 to m+c.

If m+1 >k, then p >k, so NO.

If m+c <=k, then p <=k, so YES.

Else, MAYBE.

In the code, it sorts the array in descending order and looks at a[k].

If a[k] > x: NO

If a[k] < x: YES

If a[k] == x:

- If k == n-1: YES

- Elif a[k+1] < x: YES

- Else: MAYBE

I need to see if this corresponds to my logic.

Let me relate m and c to the sorted array.

In the sorted array, the first m positions have values > x.

Then, the next c positions have values == x.

Then, the remaining positions have values < x.

So, in the sorted array:

- Positions 0 to m-1: values > x

- Positions m to m+c-1: values == x

- Positions m+c to n-1: values < x

Now, in the code:

- If a[k] > x: means that position k is in the first m positions, so m >k.

But wait, positions are from 0 to n-1.

So, if a[k] > x, then k < m, meaning m >k.

Then, in this case, p starts from m+1, which is >k, so NO.

Wait, no.

Wait, p starts from m+1 to m+c.

But if m >k, then m+1 >k, so p >k, so NO.

Which matches the code's "NO".

If a[k] < x, meaning that k >= m+c, meaning that m+c <=k, so p <= m+c <=k, so YES.

Wait, but in the code, it's "YES" if a[k] < x.

Wait, but according to my logic, if m+c <=k, then YES.

But in the sorted array, a[k] < x implies that k >= m+c.

Because positions m+c to n-1 have a[k] < x.

Hence, m+c <=k.

So, YES.

If a[k] == x, then:

- If k == n-1, then p <= m+c, since m+c <=n.

- Or, if a[k+1] < x, which would mean that k+1 >= m+c, so m+c <=k+1.

But since a[k] == x, and a[k+1] < x, then m+c == k+1.

So, p <= m+c == k+1.

So, p <=k+1.

But p >= m+1.

If m+1 <=k, then p could be from m+1 to k+1.

Wait, this seems a bit messy.

Perhaps I need a better way to see this.

Let me consider that:

- The favorite cube can be placed anywhere from position m+1 to m+c.

- If m+1 >k, then p >k, so NO.

- If m+c <=k, then p <=k, so YES.

- Else, p could be <=k or >k, so MAYBE.

Now, in the code:

- If a[k] > x: NO

- If a[k] < x: YES

- If a[k] == x:

- If k == n-1: YES

- Elif a[k+1] < x: YES

- Else: MAYBE

I need to see if this corresponds to my logic.

From the sorted array:

- a[k] > x: m >k, so p >k, NO

- a[k] < x: m+c <=k, so p <=k, YES

- a[k] == x:

- If k == n-1: p <= m+c <=n, which is p <=k+1-1=n, so p <=k in this case? Wait, k ==n-1.

- Or, if a[k+1] < x: m+c ==k+1, so p <=k+1, but p >=m+1.

If m+1 <=k, then p could be from m+1 to k+1.

But since m+c ==k+1, and a[k] ==x, a[k+1]<x.

So, m+c ==k+1.

If m+1 <=k, then p could be from m+1 to k+1.

If m+1 <=k, then p could be <=k or ==k+1.

So, in some cases, p <=k, in others, p >k, so MAYBE.

Wait, but in the code, it's "YES" in this case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, let's see.

In the case where a[k] ==x and a[k+1]<x, which means that m+c ==k+1.

Then, p can be from m+1 to m+c ==k+1.

But p <=k or p ==k+1.

So, if p <=k, removed, else not.

So, it's possible that the favorite cube is removed or not, depending on its position.

So, it should be MAYBE.

But the code prints "YES" in this case.

Wait, but in my earlier logic, it should be MAYBE.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the code, it's "YES" if k ==n-1 or a[k+1]<x.

But according to my logic, it should be "MAYBE" in this case.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, let's check with an example.

Take n=5, f=3, k=3, a=[3,3,2,3,2]

v=2

sorted a=[3,3,3,2,2]

a[k=3-1=2] =3 ==x=2? No, x=2.

Wait, a[k=2] =3 >2, so a[k] >x, so NO.

But according to my logic:

m=number of a[i]>2: three 3's.

c=number of a[i]==2: two 2's.

So, p from m+1=4 to m+c=5.

k=3.

So, p=4 or 5, which are both >k=3, so NO.

Which matches the code's "NO".

Another example:

n=5, f=3, k=4, a=[3,3,2,3,2]

v=2

sorted a=[3,3,3,2,2]

a[k=4-1=3] =2 ==x=2.

Now, check if k==n-1=4==4, yes, so "YES".

According to my logic:

m=3, c=2.

p from 4 to 5.

k=4.

So, p=4 <=4, so YES.

Hence, correct.

Another case:

n=5, f=3, k=2, a=[3,3,2,3,2]

v=2

sorted a=[3,3,3,2,2]

a[k=2-1=1]=3 >2, so "NO"

My logic: m=3, c=2.

p=4 or 5 >k=2, so NO.

Correct.

Another case:

n=5, f=3, k=3, a=[3,2,2,2,2]

v=2

sorted a=[3,2,2,2,2]

a[k=3-1=2]=2 ==x=2.

Now, check if k==n-1=4, no.

Then, check a[k+1]=a[3]=2 not <x=2, so "MAYBE"

According to my logic:

m=1 (only one 3)

c=4 (four 2's)

p from m+1=2 to m+c=5.

k=3.

So, p=2,3,4,5.

p=2 <=3, so removed.

p=4 <=3? No, p=4 >3, not removed.

So, MAYBE.

Hence, correct.

Another case:

n=5, f=3, k=2, a=[3,2,2,2,2]

v=2

sorted a=[3,2,2,2,2]

a[k=2-1=1]=2 ==x=2

Check if k==n-1=4, no.

Check a[k+1]=a[2]=2 not <x=2, so "MAYBE"

My logic: m=1, c=4.

p from 2 to 5.

k=2.

p=2 <=2, removed.

p=5 >2, not removed.

So, MAYBE.

Correct.

Another case:

n=5, f=3, k=5, a=[2,2,2,2,2]

v=2

sorted a=[2,2,2,2,2]

a[k=5-1=4]=2 ==x=2

Check if k==n-1=4, yes, so "YES"

My logic: m=0, c=5.

p from 1 to 5.

k=5.

p <=5, so YES.

Correct.

Another case:

n=5, f=3, k=3, a=[2,2,2,1,1]

v=2

sorted a=[2,2,2,1,1]

a[k=3-1=2]=2 ==x=2

Check if k==n-1=4, no.

Check a[k+1]=a[3]=1 <x=2, so "YES"

My logic: m=3, c=2.

Wait, m=number of a[i]>2: none, so m=0.

c=number of a[i]==2: three 2's.

Wait, but in the sorted array, a=[2,2,2,1,1]

So, m=0, c=3.

p from 1 to 3.

k=3.

So, p=1,2,3 <=3, so YES.

Hence, correct.

Wait, but in the code, a[k=2]=2 ==x=2, and a[k+1]=1 <x=2, so "YES"

Correct.

So, seems like the code is correct.

I must have miscounted m and c in earlier examples.

Hence, the code is correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube is removed after sorting the cubes in non-increasing order and removing the first `k` cubes.

## Approach

1. **Input Parsing**:
    - Read the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, read `n` (number of cubes), `f` (index of the favorite cube), and `k` (number of cubes to remove).
    - Read the array `a` representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Adjust Indices**:
    - Adjust `f` to be zero-based for easier array indexing.
    - Adjust `k` to be zero-based for easier positioning in the sorted array.

3. **Determine Favorite Cube's Value**:
    - Identify the value `x` of the favorite cube using `a[f]`.

4. **Sort the Array**:
    - Sort the array `a` in non-increasing order.

5. **Check Conditions**:
    - If the value at position `k` in the sorted array is greater than `x`, the favorite cube is not among the removed cubes (`NO`).
    - If the value at position `k` is less than `x`, the favorite cube is definitely among the removed cubes (`YES`).
    - If the value at position `k` is equal to `x`:
        - If `k` is the last position (`k == n-1`), the favorite cube is removed (`YES`).
        - If the next value in the sorted array is less than `x`, all cubes with value `x` are among the removed cubes (`YES`).
        - Otherwise, it's uncertain (`MAYBE`), as the favorite cube might or might not be removed based on its position among cubes with the same value.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1
        k -= 1
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = a[f]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            if k == n - 1 or (k + 1 < n and a[k + 1] < x):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('MAYBE')

```

## Explanation

- **Step 1**: Read the input values for each test case.
- **Step 2**: Adjust the favorite cube index `f` and the removal position `k` to zero-based indices.
- **Step 3**: Identify the value `x` of the favorite cube.
- **Step 4**: Sort the array `a` in non-increasing order.
- **Step 5**: Based on the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted array:
  - If it's greater than `x`, print `NO`.
