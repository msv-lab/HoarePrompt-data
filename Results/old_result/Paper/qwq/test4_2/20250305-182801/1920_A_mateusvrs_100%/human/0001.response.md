Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these n constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of k is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same, meaning all (a, x) pairs are distinct.

First, I need to understand the input and output format. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line has an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line is n, the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing a pair of integers a and x, where a is the type of constraint and x is the value.

My task is to process each test case and output a single integer for each, which is the number of integers k that satisfy all the given constraints.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

6

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

2

1 5

2 4

...

Output:

7

0

90

0

0

800000000

From the first test case:

- k >= 3

- k <= 10

- k != 1

- k != 5

So, possible k values are 3,4,6,7,8,9,10, which is 7 values.

In the second test case:

- k >= 5

- k <= 4

which is impossible, so 0.

Third test case has more constraints, and the output is 90, and so on.

Alright, so I need to process each test case separately, find the range of k based on the type 1 and type 2 constraints, and then subtract the number of k values that are forbidden by the type 3 constraints.

But, I have to be careful about the overlapping constraints and ensure that I don't double-count any forbidden k values.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, for each test case, I need to find the lower bound and upper bound for k based on the type 1 and type 2 constraints.

Since there is at least one type 1 and one type 2 constraint, and it's guaranteed that the range is finite, I can find the maximum of all type 1 x values for the lower bound and the minimum of all type 2 x values for the upper bound.

So, for type 1 constraints (k >= x), the lower bound is the maximum x among all type 1 constraints.

For type 2 constraints (k <= x), the upper bound is the minimum x among all type 2 constraints.

Then, the possible k values are from lower bound to upper bound, inclusive, provided that k does not equal any of the x values in type 3 constraints.

Also, it's guaranteed that no two constraints are the same, so no duplicate (a, x) pairs.

Now, to find the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints, I need to calculate the total number of integers from lower bound to upper bound, inclusive, and subtract the number of integers in that range that are forbidden by the type 3 constraints.

So, the total number of possible k values is (upper bound - lower bound + 1), and then subtract the number of type 3 x values that fall within this range.

Wait, but type 3 constraints are k != x, so I need to exclude those x values that are within the range [lower bound, upper bound].

But, since type 3 constraints can have x values outside this range, I need to count only those type 3 x values that are within the range.

So, first, find the lower and upper bounds.

Then, collect all type 3 x values that are within [lower bound, upper bound].

Finally, the number of valid k is (upper bound - lower bound + 1) minus the number of type 3 x values within this range.

Seems straightforward.

Let me think about potential edge cases.

1. If the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, meaning no possible k satisfies the constraints, the result is 0.

2. If the lower bound equals the upper bound, and there's a type 3 constraint with x equal to that value, then the result is 0.

3. If there are multiple type 3 constraints with x values within the range, I need to ensure that each is subtracted only once, even if there are multiple type 3 constraints with different x values.

But the problem states that no two constraints are the same, so all (a, x) pairs are distinct. Therefore, each type 3 x value is unique.

Also, since n can be up to 100, and t up to 500, I need an efficient solution, but given the constraints, a straightforward approach should work.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

r = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

cx = set()

ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)

bx = -1

for _ in range(n):

(a, x) = map(int, input().split())

if a == 1:

bx = max(x, bx)

elif a == 2:

ax = min(x, ax)

else:

cx.add(x)

if bx > ax:

r.append(0)

else:

tmp = 0

for i in cx:

if i >= bx and i <= ax:

tmp += 1

r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)

print(*r, sep='\n')

So, in this code:

- It reads the number of test cases t.

- For each test case, it reads n, the number of constraints.

- Initializes a set cx to store type 3 x values.

- Initializes ax to a large value (1000000007) and bx to -1.

- Then, for each of the n constraints:

- Reads a and x.

- If a == 1, it's type 1, so sets bx to the maximum of x and current bx.

- If a == 2, it's type 2, so sets ax to the minimum of x and current ax.

- If a == 3, it's type 3, so adds x to the set cx.

- After processing all constraints:

- If bx > ax, meaning the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, so no possible k, appends 0 to the result list r.

- Else, counts the number of type 3 x values that are within the range [bx, ax], inclusive.

- Then, calculates the number of valid k as (ax - bx + 1) - tmp, where tmp is the number of forbidden x values in the range.

- Finally, prints all results in r, separated by newlines.

This seems to align with my understanding of the problem.

Let me verify with the first test case:

Input:

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, n=4

Constraints:

- a=1, x=3 → bx = max(3, -1) = 3

- a=2, x=10 → ax = min(10, 1000000007) = 10

- a=3, x=1 → cx = {1}

- a=3, x=5 → cx = {1,5}

Then, bx=3, ax=10

Check if 3 > 10? No.

tmp = number of x in cx where x >=3 and x <=10

So, x=1 is not in [3,10], so tmp=1 (only x=5 is in the range)

So, number of valid k = (10 - 3 + 1) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Second test case:

2

1 5

2 4

So, n=2

Constraints:

- a=1, x=5 → bx = max(5, -1) = 5

- a=2, x=4 → ax = min(4, 1000000007) = 4

Then, bx=5, ax=4

Check if 5 > 4? Yes, so append 0, which matches the sample output.

Third test case:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

So, n=10

Constraints:

- a=3, x=6 → cx={6}

- a=3, x=7 → cx={6,7}

- a=1, x=2 → bx = max(2, -1) = 2

- a=1, x=7 → bx = max(7,2) = 7

- a=3, x=100 → cx={6,7,100}

- a=3, x=44 → cx={6,7,44,100}

- a=2, x=100 → ax = min(100,1000000007)=100

- a=2, x=98 → ax = min(98,100)=98

- a=1, x=3 → bx = max(3,7)=7

- a=3, x=99 → cx={6,7,44,99,100}

So, bx=7, ax=98

Check if 7 > 98? No.

tmp = number of x in cx where x >=7 and x <=98

cx={6,7,44,99,100}

x=6: <7, so no

x=7: >=7 and <=98, yes

x=44: >=7 and <=98, yes

x=99: >98, no

x=100: >98, no

So, tmp=2 (x=7 and x=44)

Number of valid k = (98 - 7 +1) - 2 = 92 - 2 = 90, which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Now, looking at the code again, I need to ensure that there are no mistakes in the implementation.

- It uses a set cx to store type 3 x values, which is fine since x values are unique for each constraint.

- It initializes ax to a large value (1000000007) and bx to -1, which is appropriate.

- It updates bx as the maximum of x for type 1 constraints, which correctly finds the highest lower bound.

- It updates ax as the minimum of x for type 2 constraints, which correctly finds the lowest upper bound.

- If bx > ax, it's impossible, so it appends 0.

- Otherwise, it counts the number of type 3 x values within [bx, ax] and subtracts that from the total range size.

This seems correct.

Is there any potential error?

- Maybe integer overflow, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no issue.

- Need to ensure that the type 3 x values are only considered if they are within the range [bx, ax].

- The code uses a set for cx, which is efficient for lookups.

- The loop for counting tmp is O(m), where m is the number of type 3 constraints, which is acceptable since n <= 100.

- The final output is printed with each result separated by a newline.

I think the code is correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a given set of constraints. The constraints include lower bounds, upper bounds, and exclusions for \( k \). We are guaranteed that there is at least one lower and one upper bound, ensuring a finite solution space.

### Approach

1. **Processing Constraints:**
    - For each test case, read the number of constraints \( n \).
    - Read each constraint and categorize them:
        - Type 1: \( k \geq x \) — Update the lower bound to the maximum \( x \) encountered.
        - Type 2: \( k \leq x \) — Update the upper bound to the minimum \( x \) encountered.
        - Type 3: \( k \neq x \) — Collect these \( x \) values in a set.

2. **Determine Feasible Range:**
    - Calculate the feasible range for \( k \) using the lower and upper bounds.
    - If the lower bound exceeds the upper bound, no solution exists (output 0).

3. **Exclude Forbidden Values:**
    - Count how many forbidden values (type 3 constraints) fall within the feasible range.
    - Subtract the number of forbidden values from the total number of integers in the range.

4. **Output Results:**
    - Collect results for all test cases and print them.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)  # Large initial upper bound
        bx = -1  # Low initial lower bound
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')

func()
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1:** Read the number of test cases \( t \).
- **Step 2:** For each test case, read \( n \) constraints.
- **Step 3:** Process each constraint:
  - Update the lower bound \( bx \) to be the maximum of all type 1 constraints.
  - Update the upper bound \( ax \) to be the minimum of all type 2 constraints.
  - Collect type 3 constraints in a set \( cx \).
- **Step 4:** If \( bx > ax \), append 0 to results as no \( k \) satisfies the constraints.
- **Step 5:** Otherwise, count the number of forbidden values within \( [bx, ax] \) and subtract this from the total range size \( ax - bx + 1 \).
- **Step 6:** Print the results for all test cases.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the number of valid integers \( k \) by leveraging simple yet effective bounds and exclusion checks.
