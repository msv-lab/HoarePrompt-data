Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where I'm placing white rooks and the computer is placing black rooks in response. The rules are that no two rooks can attack each other, which means they can't share the same row or column. Also, the computer mirrors my moves by swapping rows and columns, unless I place a rook on the diagonal where row equals column, in which case the computer can't mirror it and skips its turn.

I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible after continuing the game until no more valid moves are left, starting from k initial moves that have already been made, and both my moves and the computer's mirrored moves are valid.

First, I need to understand the state of the board after k moves. Each of my moves places a white rook, and the computer mirrors it by placing a black rook at the swapped position, unless I place on the diagonal, in which case the computer skips its turn.

So, for each of my k moves:

- If I place at (r, c) where r != c, the computer places at (c, r).

- If I place at (r, r), the computer skips.

Therefore, for k moves, the number of rooks placed is:

- For each non-diagonal move: 2 rooks (mine and computer's).

- For each diagonal move: 1 rook (only mine).

I need to calculate how many such moves have been made and how many positions are still available for further moves.

Let me denote:

- Let num be the total number of positions already occupied.

- For each move:

- If c != r, then both (c, r) and (r, c) are occupied.

- If c == r, only (r, c) is occupied.

So, num = number of diagonal moves (where c == r) + 2 * number of non-diagonal moves.

Then, m = n - num, which is the number of remaining positions where I can place my white rooks.

Now, the problem reduces to finding how many different final configurations are possible from this state, considering that I always place white rooks and the computer mirrors my moves, except when I place on the diagonal.

But wait, I need to consider that the computer mirrors my moves, so for every non-diagonal move I make, the computer makes a corresponding move. Also, if I place on the diagonal, the computer skips.

I need to model the game from this point forward, considering that I'm the one making the first move each time, and the computer responds accordingly.

Let me think about the game progression:

1. I place a white rook at some position (r, c).

2. If r != c, the computer places a black rook at (c, r).

3. If r == c, the computer skips.

4. We repeat this until no more moves can be made.

I need to find the number of distinct final configurations that can arise from the current state.

First, I need to understand the constraints due to the rooks already placed. Each rook, whether white or black, occupies its row and column, preventing any other rooks from being placed there.

Given that, the board can be divided into regions that are still available for placement.

But considering the mirroring nature of the computer's moves, there seems to be some symmetry involved.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing a set of positions for my white rooks, and the computer's black rooks are determined based on my choices.

But it's getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Looking at the sample input and output:

In the first test case:

n = 4, k = 1, move: (1,2)

So, I place a white rook at (1,2), computer places a black rook at (2,1).

Now, the board has rooks at (1,2) and (2,1). No rooks are on the diagonal.

From this state, the possible final configurations are 3, as explained in the note.

Similarly, in the second test case:

n = 8, k = 1, move: (7,6)

I place at (7,6), computer at (6,7).

From this state, there are 331 possible final configurations.

In the third test case:

n = 1000, k = 4, with specific moves.

The output is 671968183.

Given that n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient solution.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

t -= 1

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

num = 0

for i in range(k):

(c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

if c == r:

num += 1

else:

num += 2

m = n - num

if m == 0:

print(1)

elif m == 1:

print(1)

else:

dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]

dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = 3

for i in range(3, m + 1):

dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)

print(dp[m])

It calculates num as the total number of positions already occupied, considering that diagonal moves occupy only one position, and non-diagonal moves occupy two positions.

Then, m = n - num is the number of remaining positions available for new moves.

If m == 0, there are no moves left, so only one configuration.

If m == 1, place one white rook, and since it's on the diagonal, computer skips, so only one configuration.

For m >= 2, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations.

The DP array is defined with dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3.

Then, for each i from 3 to m, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i-1)*dp[i-2]*2 mod 10^9+7.

I need to verify if this DP approach correctly models the number of possible final configurations.

First, let's understand what dp[m] represents. It seems to represent the number of ways to place white rooks on m remaining positions, considering the mirroring by the computer.

But I need to ensure that no two rooks attack each other, meaning no two rooks share the same row or column.

Given the mirroring nature, placing a rook at (r,c) forces the computer to place at (c,r), unless r == c.

So, the available positions must be such that no two rooks share the same row or column, considering both my moves and the computer's moves.

This seems similar to placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard, but with the additional constraint of mirroring.

In standard non-attacking rook placements, the number of ways to place k non-attacking rooks on an n x n chessboard is given by the number of permutations of n elements taken k at a time, i.e., P(n,k) = n! / (n - k)!.

However, in this problem, the mirroring adds complexity, as each non-diagonal move by me forces a corresponding move by the computer.

Moreover, moves on the diagonal only occupy one position, and the computer skips.

So, perhaps the remaining available positions can be modeled in terms of pairs (for non-diagonal positions) and singles (for diagonal positions).

Wait, but in the code, num is calculated by counting diagonal moves as occupying one position and non-diagonal moves as occupying two positions.

Then, m = n - num is the number of remaining positions available for new moves.

But I need to consider that placing a rook on a non-diagonal position affects two positions, while placing on the diagonal affects only one.

Wait, perhaps m represents the number of remaining independent choices I can make.

But I'm not sure if simply subtracting num from n correctly captures the remaining degrees of freedom.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set of positions that are still available after the initial k moves and the computer's responses.

I need to place rooks in such a way that no two rooks share the same row or column.

This is similar to placing non-attacking rooks, which is equivalent to choosing a partial permutation.

However, the mirroring complicates this, as each non-diagonal move by me requires the computer to place a rook in the mirrored position.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting pairs of positions that are not on the diagonal, and single positions on the diagonal.

Wait, but in the code, m seems to represent the number of independent choices I can make, and dp[m] calculates the number of ways based on that.

Let me try to see if this DP makes sense.

Looking at dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3.

For m = 1, there is only one way: place a rook on the single remaining position, which must be on the diagonal, and the computer skips.

For m = 2, there are three ways:

1. Place a rook on position A, computer mirrors on position B.

2. Place a rook on position B, computer mirrors on position A.

3. Place a rook on the diagonal position.

Wait, but m represents the remaining independent choices. Maybe m represents the number of independent positions or pairs available.

Alternatively, perhaps m represents the number of positions that can be chosen independently, considering the mirroring.

Looking back at the DP transition:

dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2 mod 10^9+7

This seems to suggest that at each step, I can either:

- Not place a rook, leading to dp[i - 1], but that doesn't make sense because I have to place a rook in my turn.

- Place a rook in one of the i - 1 positions, which then forces the computer to place a rook in the mirrored position, and the remaining positions are i - 2.

But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps dp[i] represents the number of ways to place rooks on i independent positions, considering the mirroring.

Wait, maybe m needs to be adjusted to account for the pairs and singles correctly.

I think there might be an error in how m is calculated.

Let me consider the first test case:

n = 4, k = 1, move: (1,2)

So, I place at (1,2), computer at (2,1).

Thus, positions (1,2) and (2,1) are occupied.

So, num = 2 (since c != r).

m = 4 - 2 = 2.

Then, dp[2] = 3, which matches the sample output of 3 for this case.

Similarly, for n = 8, k = 1, move: (7,6)

num = 2 (since c != r).

m = 8 - 2 = 6.

dp[6] should be calculated as:

dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = 3

dp[3] = dp[2] + 2*dp[1]*2 = 3 + 4 = 7

dp[4] = dp[3] + 3*dp[2]*2 = 7 + 18 = 25

dp[5] = dp[4] + 4*dp[3]*2 = 25 + 56 = 81

dp[6] = dp[5] + 5*dp[4]*2 = 81 + 250 = 331

Which matches the sample output of 331.

So, the DP seems to be working correctly for this case.

Now, let's consider another case where k = 0, meaning no initial moves.

Then, num = 0, m = n.

According to the DP:

dp[n] is calculated as above.

For n = 1, dp[1] = 1.

For n = 2, dp[2] = 3.

For n = 3, dp[3] = 7.

And so on.

But what is the actual number of final configurations when k = 0?

When k = 0, we start with an empty board and place rooks alternately, with the computer mirroring my moves.

Let's consider n = 1:

Only one position (1,1). I place a white rook there, computer skips. No more moves. So, only one configuration.

Which matches dp[1] = 1.

n = 2:

Positions: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).

I can:

1. Place at (1,1), computer skips. Then, place at (2,2), computer skips. So, two white rooks on diagonals.

2. Place at (1,2), computer places at (2,1). No more moves.

3. Place at (2,1), computer places at (1,2). No more moves.

So, three configurations:

- White at (1,1) and white at (2,2).

- White at (1,2) and black at (2,1).

- White at (2,1) and black at (1,2).

Which matches dp[2] = 3.

n = 3:

Positions: 9 in total.

Following the same logic, the DP gives dp[3] = 7.

I can enumerate the possible configurations:

1. Place at (1,1), computer skips. Then place at (2,2), computer skips. Then place at (3,3), computer skips.

2. Place at (1,1), skip (computer), then place at (2,3), place black at (3,2).

3. Place at (1,2), place black at (2,1). Then, no more moves.

4. Place at (1,3), place black at (3,1). Then, no more moves.

5. Place at (2,1), place black at (1,2). Then, place at (3,3), skip.

6. Place at (2,3), place black at (3,2). Then, place at (1,1), skip.

7. Place at (3,1), place black at (1,3). Then, place at (2,2), skip.

So, seven configurations, matching dp[3] = 7.

This seems consistent.

Therefore, the DP approach seems to correctly calculate the number of final configurations based on the remaining independent choices, m.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
