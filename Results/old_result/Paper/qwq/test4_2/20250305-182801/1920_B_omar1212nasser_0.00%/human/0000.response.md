Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players, Alice and Bob, and they're playing a game with an array of numbers. The game has two steps: first, Alice can remove up to k elements from the array, and then Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final sum would be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the inputs and outputs. The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers: n, k, and x, where n is the number of elements in the array, k is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and x is the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1. Then, there's a list of n integers, which is the array they're playing with.

The output should be the sum of the array after both players have done their operations, assuming they both play optimally.

Looking at the example, there are 8 test cases, and for each, there's an output value. For instance, in the first test case, with n=1, k=1, x=1, and the array [1], the output is 0. That makes sense because Alice can remove the single element, and then there's nothing left for Bob to do, so the sum is 0.

In the second test case, n=4, k=1, x=1, array [3,1,2,4], the output is 2. So, Alice can remove one element. To maximize the sum, she should remove the smallest element, which is 1. So, the array becomes [3,2,4]. Then, Bob can multiply one element by -1 to minimize the sum. He should multiply the largest positive element, which is 4, by -1, making it -4. So, the sum is 3 + 2 + (-4) = 1. But wait, the output is 2, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Bob multiplies up to x elements by -1, but he doesn't have to use all x if it's not beneficial. Maybe in this case, it's better for Bob to multiply the smallest positive element, which is 2, by -1, making it -2. Then, the sum would be 3 + (-2) + 4 = 5, which is still higher than 1. Hmm, but the output is 2, so maybe my approach is wrong.

Let me think again. Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's move, and Bob wants to minimize it. So, Alice has to anticipate what Bob will do and choose her removals accordingly.

Maybe I should sort the array first to make it easier to decide which elements to remove or multiply by -1.

Let's consider the second test case again: n=4, k=1, x=1, array [3,1,2,4].

First, sort the array: [1,2,3,4].

Alice can remove up to 1 element. She wants to maximize the sum after Bob multiplies up to 1 element by -1.

If Alice removes the smallest element, 1, the array becomes [2,3,4]. Bob will then multiply the largest element, 4, by -1 to minimize the sum, resulting in [2,3,-4], sum is 1.

If Alice removes the largest element, 4, the array becomes [1,2,3]. Bob will multiply the largest element, 3, by -1, resulting in [1,2,-3], sum is 0.

If Alice removes the second smallest, 2, the array becomes [1,3,4]. Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in [1,3,-4], sum is 0.

If Alice removes the second largest, 3, the array becomes [1,2,4]. Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in [1,2,-4], sum is -1.

So, among these options, the maximum sum Alice can achieve is 1, but the sample output is 2. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Bob can choose to not multiply any element by -1 if it's better for him. Let's see.

If Alice removes 1, the array is [2,3,4]. Bob can choose to multiply 4 by -1, resulting in [2,3,-4], sum 1, or he can choose not to multiply any, keeping the sum 9. But Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he would choose to multiply 4 by -1 to get 1.

If Alice removes 2, array is [1,3,4]. Bob can multiply 4 by -1, getting [1,3,-4], sum 0, or not multiply any, keeping sum 8. He chooses to multiply, getting sum 0.

If Alice removes 3, array is [1,2,4]. Bob can multiply 4 by -1, getting [1,2,-4], sum -1, or not multiply any, keeping sum 7. He chooses to multiply, getting -1.

If Alice removes 4, array is [1,2,3]. Bob can multiply 3 by -1, getting [1,2,-3], sum 0, or not multiply any, keeping sum 6. He chooses to multiply, getting 0.

So, the best option for Alice is to remove 1, resulting in a sum of 1, but the sample output is 2. Hmm, maybe I need to consider that Bob can only multiply up to x elements, but in this case x=1.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output. Let's check the sample input and output again.

In the second test case:

Input:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Output:

2

But according to my calculations, the sum should be 1. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Bob can only multiply up to x elements, but he doesn't have to use all x if it's not beneficial. Maybe in this case, there's a better choice for Alice.

Let me think differently. Maybe Alice should remove one element in such a way that after Bob multiplies up to x elements by -1, the sum is maximized.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the parity of x or something like that.

Let me consider another approach. Suppose Alice removes k elements, and then Bob multiplies up to x elements by -1 from the remaining elements.

To maximize the sum, Alice wants to keep the largest possible elements, but she has to consider that Bob will try to minimize the sum by flipping the sign of the largest elements.

So, perhaps Alice should remove the smallest elements, so that the remaining elements are larger, but Bob can flip the largest ones.

Wait, but in the second test case, if Alice removes the smallest element, 1, then the array is [2,3,4], and Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 1.

But according to the sample output, it's 2. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample explanation. Let me check the fifth test case to see if I can understand the logic.

Fifth test case:

8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

Output: -5

Let's see. n=8, k=5, x=3.

So, Alice can remove up to 5 elements, and Bob can multiply up to 3 elements by -1.

To maximize the sum, Alice should probably remove the smallest elements, but Bob will flip the largest remaining elements.

Sort the array: [2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9]

If Alice removes the smallest 5 elements: [2,3,3,3,5], the remaining array is [5,9,9]. Bob can flip up to 3 elements, but there are only 3 left, so he flips all of them to -5, -9, -9, sum is -5 + (-9) + (-9) = -23, which is worse than the sample output of -5.

Alternatively, if Alice removes fewer elements, say 4, leaving [3,5,9,9]. Bob flips the top 3: [-3,-5,-9,9], sum is -3 + (-5) + (-9) + 9 = -8.

If Alice removes 3 elements, leaving [5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: [-5,-9,-9], sum is -23.

If Alice removes 2 elements, leaving [3,5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: [-3,-5,-9,9], sum is -8.

If Alice removes 1 element, leaving [2,3,3,5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: [-2,-3,-3,5,9,9], sum is 15.

If Alice removes 0 elements, leaving all [2,3,3,5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: [-2,-3,-3,5,9,9], sum is 15.

So, the maximum sum Alice can achieve is 15, but the sample output is -5. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice and Bob are playing optimally, meaning that Alice chooses k elements to remove, and then Bob chooses x elements to flip from the remaining ones, and I need to find the sum that results from both playing optimally.

In the fifth test case, the output is -5, but according to my calculations, the best Alice can do is 15, which contradicts the sample output. So, I must be misunderstanding something.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both players play optimally."

Alice wants to maximize the sum, and Bob wants to minimize it.

So, it's a minimax problem: Alice tries to maximize the sum considering that Bob will minimize it after her move.

In game theory, this is similar to finding the optimal strategy where one player maximizes and the other minimizes.

I think I need to find the maximum sum that Alice can ensure, regardless of Bob's choice within his constraints.

Looking back at the second test case: n=4, k=1, x=1, array [3,1,2,4].

Option 1: Alice removes 1 (smallest), array becomes [2,3,4]. Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 2 + 3 + (-4) = 1.

Option 2: Alice removes 2, array becomes [1,3,4]. Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 1 + 3 + (-4) = 0.

Option 3: Alice removes 3, array becomes [1,2,4]. Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 1 + 2 + (-4) = -1.

Option 4: Alice removes 4, array becomes [1,2,3]. Bob flips 3 to -3, sum is 1 + 2 + (-3) = 0.

So, the best option for Alice is to remove 1, resulting in a sum of 1, but the sample output is 2. So, maybe I'm missing another option.

Wait, perhaps Alice can choose to remove more than one element, but in this case, k=1, so she can only remove up to one element.

Wait, k=1 means she can remove up to one element, or choose to remove zero elements.

So, if she removes zero elements, the array is [1,2,3,4]. Bob can flip up to one element. He flips 4 to -4, sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + (-4) = 2, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, it's better for Alice to not remove any elements, and let Bob flip one element, resulting in a sum of 2, which is better than 1.

I must have missed that option earlier. So, Alice has the option to remove zero elements as well.

So, in general, Alice can choose to remove anywhere from 0 to k elements, and then Bob will flip up to x elements from the remaining array.

I need to consider all possible numbers of elements Alice removes (from 0 to k) and find the sum in each case, assuming Bob flips the top x elements.

Then, Alice will choose the option that maximizes the sum after Bob's flip.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, according to my earlier calculation, if Alice removes 0 elements, the sum is 15 after Bob flips 3 elements.

But the sample output is -5, which is different from my calculation.

Wait, in the fifth test case: n=8, k=5, x=3, array [5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9]

If Alice removes 0 elements, array is [2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9]. Bob flips the top 3 elements: 9,9,5 -> -9,-9,-5. Sum is 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + (-5) + (-9) + (-9) = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 -5 -9 -9 = (2+3+3+3+5) + (-5-9-9) = 16 + (-23) = -7, which is different from the sample output of -5.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let's sort the array: [2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9]

If Alice removes 0 elements, Bob flips the top 3 elements: 9,9,5 -> -9,-9,-5.

Sum: 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + (-5) + (-9) + (-9) = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 -5 -9 -9 = (2+3+3+3+5) + (-5-9-9) = 16 -23 = -7, but sample output is -5. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Bob doesn't have to flip all x elements if it's not beneficial for him. But in this case, flipping any fewer would result in a higher sum, which is against his goal to minimize the sum.

So, he should flip the top x elements to minimize the sum.

But according to the sample, the output is -5, but my calculation is -7, which is different from the sample.

Wait, maybe I misread the array or the values.

Wait, in the fifth test case, the array is [5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9], and k=5, x=3.

If Alice removes 5 elements, she can remove the smallest 5 elements: 2,3,3,3,3, leaving [5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: -5,-9,-9, sum is -5 + (-9) + (-9) = -23.

If she removes 4 elements: remove 2,3,3,3, leaving [5,5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: -5,-9,-9, sum is 5 + (-5) + (-9) + (-9) = -18.

If she removes 3 elements: remove 2,3,3, leaving [3,5,5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: -3,-9,-9, sum is 5 + 5 + 9 + (-3) + (-9) + (-9) = 5 + 5 + 9 -3 -9 -9 = (5+5+9) + (-3-9-9) = 19 -21 = -2.

If she removes 2 elements: remove 2,3, leaving [3,3,5,5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: -9,-9,-5, sum is 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 + (-9) + (-9) = 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 -9 -9 = (3+3+5+5) + (-9-9) = 16 -18 = -2.

If she removes 1 element: remove 2, leaving [3,3,3,5,5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: -9,-9,-5, sum is 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 + (-9) + (-9) = 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 -9 -9 = (3+3+3+5+5) + (-9-9) = 19 -18 = 1.

If she removes 0 elements: [2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: -9,-9,-5, sum is 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 + (-9) + (-9) = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 -9 -9 = (2+3+3+3+5+5) + (-9-9) = 21 -18 = 3.

So, among these options, the maximum sum Alice can achieve is 3, but the sample output is -5. That doesn't match. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample explanation or in my understanding.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both players play optimally."

So, both players play optimally, meaning Alice chooses the removals to maximize the sum after Bob's flips, and Bob flips to minimize the sum.

In the fifth test case, according to my calculations, the best Alice can do is to remove 0 elements and get a sum of 3, but the sample output is -5. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that after Alice removes k elements, Bob can flip up to x elements, but not necessarily x elements. He can flip fewer if it's beneficial for him.

In the fifth test case, if Alice removes 0 elements, and Bob flips only 2 elements, say 9 and 9, sum would be 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 + (-9) + (-9) = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 -9 -9 = (2+3+3+3+5+5) + (-9-9) = 21 -18 = 3, which is still not matching the sample output of -5.

Wait, maybe Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements. But in this case, flipping 3 elements gives a lower sum than flipping 2.

Wait, no, flipping 3 elements gives sum 3 - 9 -9 -5 = -20, wait no, in my earlier calculation, flipping 3 elements: -9,-9,-5, sum is 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + (-5) + (-9) + (-9) = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 -5 -9 -9 = 16 -23 = -7.

But the sample output is -5, which is different. Maybe there's a mistake in the sample or in my understanding.

Let me check the problem constraints again.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5

- 1 ≤ k,x ≤ n

- 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 2*10^5

Wait, in the fifth test case, n=8, k=5, x=3, array=[5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9], output=-5.

According to my calculations, the best Alice can do is to remove 0 elements and let Bob flip 3 elements, resulting in sum 3, but sample output is -5.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements if it's beneficial for him.

In this case, if Alice removes 0 elements, and Bob flips only 2 elements, say 9 and 9, sum would be 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 + (-9) + (-9) = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 -9 -9 = 21 -18 = 3, which is higher than -5.

So, Bob would prefer to flip 3 elements to get sum -7, but the sample output is -5.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the sample output.

Alternatively, perhaps Alice can remove different elements to achieve -5.

If Alice removes 3 elements: say 2,3,3, leaving [3,5,5,9,9]. Bob flips 3 elements: -9,-9,-5, sum is 3 + 5 + 5 + (-9) + (-9) = 3 + 5 + 5 -9 -9 = 13 -18 = -5, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, Alice removes 2,3,3, and Bob flips 9,9,5 to -9,-9,-5, resulting in sum -5.

This is better for Alice than removing 0 elements, where sum is -7, but according to the sample output, it's -5.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, if Alice removes 0 elements, sum is -7, and if she removes 3 elements, sum is -5, which is better for her.

So, Alice会选择移除2,3,3，使得在Bob翻转9,9,5后，总和为-5，这比不移除任何元素要好。

所以，Alice需要选择移除一些元素，以最大化在Bob翻转后数组的和。

因此，在这个例子中，Alice选择移除2,3,3，使得剩余的数组为[3,5,5,9,9]，然后Bob翻转9,9,5，得到[3,5,-9,-9,-5]，总和为-5。

这比她不移除任何元素，Bob翻转9,9,5得到-7要好。

所以，Alice会选择移除2,3,3，以达到-5的总和。

因此，样本输出是-5，与我的计算一致。

之前我误解了样本输出，实际上-5是可能的。

所以，总结一下：

- Alice选择移除k个元素，以最大化在Bob翻转x个元素后的总和。

- Bob选择翻转x个元素，以最小化总和。

因此，对于每个可能的移除数量（从0到k），Alice需要计算在Bob最优翻转后的总和，并选择其中最大的一个。

现在，我需要设计一个算法来高效地计算这个值，因为n可以达到2e5，t可以达到1e4，但所有测试用例的n的总和不超过2e5。

首先，对于每个测试用例，我需要排序数组，然后考虑移除不同数量的元素，并计算在Bob翻转后的总和。

具体来说：

- 排序数组a，从小到大。

- 对于移除0到k个元素，计算剩余数组的和，减去翻转的x个最大元素的两倍（因为翻转最大元素相当于减去它们的两倍）。

- 选择这些和中的最大值。

但是，需要考虑当剩余元素少于x时，Bob只能翻转剩余的所有元素。

所以，对于每种移除i个元素（0 ≤ i ≤ k），剩余n - i个元素，Bob可以翻转min(x, n - i)个元素。

因此，sum = sum of remaining elements - 2 * sum of top min(x, n - i) remaining elements.

所以，sum = total_sum - sum of first (n - i) elements - 2 * sum of top min(x, n - i) elements.

Wait, no.

Wait, better to think in terms of selecting which elements to keep.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the array in ascending order.

Then, if Alice removes the smallest i elements, she keeps the largest n - i elements.

Then, Bob will flip the largest min(x, n - i) elements.

So, the sum will be sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the top min(x, n - i) elements.

Because flipping the top elements makes them negative.

So, sum = sum of remaining elements - 2 * sum of top min(x, n - i) elements.

Therefore, for each i from 0 to k, calculate sum = sum(a[i:n]) - 2 * sum(a[n - min(x, n - i):n])

Wait, but need to be careful with indexing.

Let me define the sorted array a in ascending order.

Then, a[0] is smallest, a[n-1] is largest.

If Alice removes a[0] to a[i-1], she keeps a[i] to a[n-1].

Bob will flip the largest min(x, n - i) elements, which are a[n - 1] to a[n - min(x, n - i)].

So, sum = sum(a[i:n]) - 2 * sum(a[n - min(x, n - i):n])

Yes, that seems correct.

So, for each i from 0 to k, calculate sum = sum(a[i:n]) - 2 * sum(a[n - min(x, n - i):n])

Then, take the maximum such sum.

This seems efficient, as sorting is O(n log n), and the rest is O(k).

But since t can be up to 1e4 and n up to 2e5, with total n over all test cases up to 2e5, it should be efficient enough.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

product = func_2(k, x, a)

print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):

if removals == 6 and negatives == 3:

return 0

pos = []

s = sum(elements)

n = sum(elements[-negatives:])

pos.append(s - 2 * n)

for i in range(1, removals + 1):

s -= elements[-i]

try:

n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]

except IndexError:

n = 0

pos.append(s - 2 * n)

return max(pos)

So, in func_2, it seems to be implementing the logic I described.

It sorts the array, then for each i from 0 to k, calculates sum = sum(a[i:n]) - 2 * sum(top min(x, n - i) elements)

But the implementation seems a bit tricky.

Let's see.

It initializes s as sum of all elements.

n as sum of the last x elements.

Then, pos.append(s - 2 * n), which corresponds to i=0, removing 0 elements.

Then, for i from 1 to k:

s -= elements[-i]

try:

n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]

except IndexError:

n = 0

pos.append(s - 2 * n)

So, it's trying to maintain s as the sum of the remaining elements after removing i elements.

By subtracting elements[-i], which is the i-th largest element.

Then, for n, which is the sum of the top min(x, n - i) elements.

Initially, n is sum of the last x elements.

Then, as i increases, it tries to adjust n accordingly.

In the loop, it does n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]

Which seems like it's trying to account for the new top min(x, n - i) elements.

But this seems error-prone and not very clear.

Moreover, there's a special case: if removals == 6 and negatives == 3, return 0.

I don't know why this is here, perhaps it's a hack for a specific test case.

Looking back at the sample input and output, in the sixth test case:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

Output: 3

According to the code, if removals == 6 and negatives == 3, return 0, but in this test case, removals = 6 and negatives = 1, so this condition doesn't apply.

Wait, in the first test case:

1 1 1

1

Output: 0

Which matches the condition removals ==1 and negatives ==1, but the code has removals ==6 and negatives ==3.

So, this condition doesn't apply here.

I think this is a red herring, and perhaps the code has some mistakes.

Let me check with the fifth test case:

8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

Output: -5

According to my earlier calculation, if Alice removes 3 elements (2,3,3), and Bob flips 9,9,5, sum is -5.

In the code, for i=3, it should calculate sum accordingly.

But I'm not sure if the code does it correctly.

Looking at the loop:

for i in range(1, removals + 1):

s -= elements[-i]

try:

n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]

except IndexError:

n = 0

pos.append(s - 2 * n)

So, for i=1:

s -= elements[-1] (which is 9)

n += elements[-(1 + 1)] - elements[-1] = elements[-2] - elements[-1] = 9 - 9 = 0

n becomes sum of last x elements minus this adjustment.

Wait, it's not clear.

I think this implementation is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the adjustment of n for different i.

A better approach would be to precompute the sum of the entire array, and for each i from 0 to k, calculate sum(a[i:n]) - 2 * sum(a[n - min(x, n - i):n])

To implement this efficiently, we can sort the array, compute prefix sums, and then for each i, compute the sum of a[i:n] as prefix[n] - prefix[i], and sum of the top min(x, n - i) elements as sum(a[n - min(x, n - i):n]), which can also be obtained from prefix sums.

But in the code, it seems to try to maintain s and n dynamically, which is error-prone.

Moreover, the special case of return 0 for removals==6 and negatives==3 doesn't make sense in the general solution.

Therefore, I think the code is incorrect.

But perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me check with the first test case:

1 1 1

1

After sorting, a=[1]

sum = 1

For i=0: sum(a[0:1]) - 2 * sum(a[1 - min(1,1):1]) = sum(a[0:1]) - 2 * sum(a[0:1]) = 1 - 2*1 = -1

For i=1: sum(a[1:1]) - 2 * sum(a[1 - min(1,0):1]) = sum([]) - 2 * sum(a[1:1]) = 0 - 2*0 = 0

So, pos = [-1, 0], max is 0, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

After sorting: [1,2,3,4]

sum = 10

For i=0: sum(a[0:4]) - 2 * sum(a[4 - min(1,4):4]) = sum([1,2,3,4]) - 2 * sum([4]) = 10 - 8 = 2

For i=1: sum(a[1:4]) - 2 * sum(a[4 - min(1,3):4]) = sum([2,3,4]) - 2 * sum([4]) = 9 - 8 = 1

So, pos = [2,1], max is 2, which matches the sample output.

In the fifth test case:

8 5 3

5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9

After sorting: [2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9]

sum = 39

For i=0: sum(a[0:8]) - 2 * sum(a[8 - min(3,8):8]) = 39 - 2*(9+9+5) = 39 - 32 = 7

For i=1: sum(a[1:8]) - 2 * sum(a[8 - min(3,7):8]) = sum([3,3,3,5,5,9,9]) - 2*(9+9+5) = 34 - 32 = 2

For i=2: sum(a[2:8]) - 2 * sum(a[8 - min(3,6):8]) = sum([3,3,5,5,9,9]) - 2*(9+9+5) = 34 - 32 = 2

For i=3: sum(a[3:8]) - 2 * sum(a[8 - min(3,5):8]) = sum([5,5,9,9]) - 2*(9+9+5) = 28 - 32 = -4

For i=4: sum(a[4:8]) - 2 * sum(a[8 - min(3,4):8]) = sum([5,9,9]) - 2*(9+9+5) = 23 - 32 = -9

For i=5: sum(a[5:8]) - 2 * sum(a[8 - min(3,3):8]) = sum([9,9]) - 2*(9+9+5) = 18 - 32 = -14

So, pos = [7,2,2,-4,-9,-14], max is 7, but sample output is -5.

Wait, that doesn't match. According to my earlier manual calculation, removing 3 elements (2,3,3) should lead to sum -5, but according to this calculation, it's -4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating sum(a[3:8]).

sum(a[3:8]) = 5 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 28

sum of top min(3,5) elements = sum(a[8 - 3:8]) = sum(a[5:8]) = 5 + 9 + 9 = 23

So, sum = 28 - 2*23 = 28 - 46 = -18, which is different from my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, the formula should be sum of remaining elements minus twice the sum of the top min(x, n - i) elements.

So, sum = sum(a[i:n]) - 2 * sum(a[n - min(x, n - i):n])

In this case, for i=3, n=8, x=3, n - i=5, min(x, n - i)=3

sum(a[3:8]) = 5 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 28

sum(a[5:8]) = 5 + 9 + 9 = 23

sum = 28 - 2*23 = -20, which is different from my manual calculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, no, 28 - 46 is -18, not -20.

But earlier, when I manually calculated removing 2,3,3, and Bob flipping 9,9,5, I got sum -5, but according to this formula, it's -18.

There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, no, the formula should be sum of remaining elements minus twice the sum of the top min(x, n - i) elements.

Because flipping the top elements means subtracting twice their sum.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the sum after flipping is sum of remaining elements minus twice the sum of the flipped elements.

So, sum = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_flipped

But sum_flipped is the sum of the top min(x, n - i) elements.

Wait, no, Bob flips the top min(x, n - i) elements to negative.

So, their contribution to the sum is minus their value, but since they were positive, flipping them subtracts twice their value.

Wait, no, it's sum_remaining - 2 * sum_flipped.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of choosing which elements to flip.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the sum is sum of non-flipped elements plus sum of flipped elements * (-1).

Original sum is sum of all remaining elements.

Flipping x elements means subtracting 2 * sum of flipped elements.

Hence, sum = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_flipped.

But Bob chooses the x largest elements to flip, to minimize the sum.

So, sum = sum_remaining - 2 * sum of top min(x, n - i) elements.

Yes, that's correct.

So, in the fifth test case, for i=3, sum_remaining = 28, sum of top 3 elements = 23, sum = 28 - 46 = -18, but earlier I thought it was -5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in manual calculation.

If Alice removes 2,3,3, remaining elements are 3,5,5,9,9.

Sum_remaining = 3+5+5+9+9=31

Sum of top 3 elements = 9+9+5=23

Sum = 31 - 46 = -15, which is different from both my earlier calculation and the sample output.

Wait, perhaps I need to recast the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be sum_remaining - 2 * sum_of_flipped, where flipped are the top min(x, n - i) elements.

So, sum = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_flipped

But sum_remaining = sum(a[i:n])

sum_flipped = sum of the top min(x, n - i) elements.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, for i=3, sum_remaining=31, sum_flipped=23, sum=31-46=-15, but sample output is -5.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that sum_remaining already includes the flipped elements, and flipping them means subtracting twice their value.

So, sum = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_flipped

Yes, that seems correct.

But according to this, it's -15, but sample output is -5.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that sum_flipped should be the sum of the elements that Bob decides to flip, which is up to x elements.

But in this case, sum_remaining = 31, sum_flipped = 23, sum = 31 - 46 = -15, but sample output is -5.

Wait, perhaps Bob doesn't have to flip all x elements.

He can flip up to x elements, but he might choose to flip fewer to minimize the sum.

Wait, but in this case, flipping all x=3 elements gives sum = 31 - 2*23 = -15, which is less than flipping fewer.

If he flips only 2 elements, sum = 31 - 2*(9+9) = 31 - 36 = -5, which is better for Alice.

But Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he would choose to flip only 2 elements, achieving sum = -5.

Wait, but according to the problem, Bob can flip up to x elements, but he doesn't have to flip fewer if it's not beneficial for him.

Wait, no, Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he would choose to flip the top x elements, but in this case, flipping only 2 elements gives a higher sum, which is worse for Bob.

Wait, no, Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he would choose to flip the top x elements, which is 3 elements, giving sum = -15, which is less than -5.

So, Bob should flip all 3 elements to minimize the sum to -15.

But according to the sample output, it's -5, which suggests that Bob chooses to flip only 2 elements.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows Bob to flip up to x elements, but he chooses the number that minimizes the sum.

So, he can choose to flip fewer than x elements if it results in a smaller sum.

In this case, flipping 2 elements gives sum = -5, which is greater than flipping 3 elements, which gives -15.

But Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he would choose to flip 3 elements to get -15.

But according to the sample output, it's -5, which suggests that Bob chooses to flip only 2 elements.

This is contradictory.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that Bob must flip exactly x elements, not up to x.

But the problem says "multiply at most x elements by -1", so up to x elements.

So, Bob would choose to flip all x elements to minimize the sum.

Hence, in this case, sum should be -15, but sample output is -5.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the sample or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps Alice can choose to remove different elements to affect Bob's choice.

For example, if Alice removes 2,3,3, sum_remaining=31, sum_flipped=23, sum=-15.

If Alice removes 2,3,2, sum_remaining=32, sum_flipped=23, sum=-14.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's -5, which suggests a different removal.

Wait, perhaps Alice removes 5,5,3, sum_remaining=24, sum_flipped=18, sum=24-36=-12.

Still worse than -5.

Wait, perhaps Alice removes 9,9, sum_remaining=15, sum_flipped=10, sum=15-20=-5, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but k=5, so Alice can remove up to 5 elements.

If she removes
