Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's this integer k, which is between 1 and n/2, and I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. These arrays have specific properties:

1. l is a subset of the first n elements of the array a.

2. r is a subset of the last n elements of the array a.

3. The bitwise XOR of elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in r.

Also, it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, which is good to know.

First, I need to understand what a subset means in this context. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting some elements from the sequence and possibly rearranging the remaining elements. So, the order doesn't matter, and elements can be in any order in l and r.

Given that, I need to select 2k elements from the first n elements for l and 2k elements from the last n elements for r, such that the XOR of elements in l equals the XOR of elements in r.

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the array, and the first n and last n elements are divided accordingly, I need to consider how these duplicates are distributed between the first and second halves.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order of operations doesn't matter, and swapping the order of operands doesn't change the result. Also, XOR of a number with itself is zero, and XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, the XOR of all elements in the array is zero because each pair of identical numbers will cancel each other out (since x XOR x = 0).

Now, I need to select subsets l and r from the first and second halves respectively, each of size 2k, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Since the total XOR of the entire array is zero, and l and r are subsets of the first and second halves, perhaps there's a way to use this property to find suitable l and r.

Wait, but l and r are subsets of different halves, and I need their XORs to be equal.

Let me consider that the XOR of all elements in the first half is some value, say XOR(b), and the XOR of all elements in the second half is XOR(c). Since the total XOR is zero, XOR(b) XOR XOR(c) = 0, which implies that XOR(b) = XOR(c).

So, XOR of the first half equals XOR of the second half.

Now, I need to find subsets l of the first half and r of the second half, each of size 2k, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting elements such that their XOR matches.

But directly finding such subsets might be complicated, especially since n can be up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 5*10^4.

I need an efficient approach.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice, and I need to choose 2k elements from each half, perhaps I can look for pairs of numbers that are shared between the two halves.

Wait, but the problem allows any subset, as long as it's a subset of the first n or the last n elements, and the XORs match.

I need to ensure that the subsets have the same XOR.

One idea is to select elements in such a way that the XOR of l and r are equal.

But how?

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n = 2, k = 1

a = [1, 2, 2, 1]

So, first half: [1, 2], second half: [2, 1]

Choose l = [2, 1], r = [2, 1]

XOR(l) = 2 XOR 1 = 3

XOR(r) = 2 XOR 1 = 3

They match.

Another test case:

n = 6, k = 1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

First half: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Choose l = [6,4], r = [1,3]

XOR(l) = 6 XOR 4 = 2

XOR(r) = 1 XOR 3 = 2

They match.

So, in this case, they chose different elements from each half, but their XORs are equal.

Another test case:

n = 4, k = 1

a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

First half: [1,2,3,4], second half: [1,2,3,4]

Choose l = [1,2], r = [1,2]

XOR(l) = 1 XOR 2 = 3

XOR(r) = 1 XOR 2 = 3

They match.

Last test case:

n = 6, k = 2

a = [5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

First half: [5,1,3,3,5,1], second half: [2,6,4,6,4,2]

Choose l = [5,1,3,3], r = [6,4,2,4]

XOR(l) = 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = (5 XOR 1) XOR (3 XOR 3) = 4 XOR 0 = 4

XOR(r) = 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = (6 XOR 4) XOR (2 XOR 4) = 2 XOR 6 = 4

So, XOR(l) = XOR(r) = 4

They match.

From these examples, it seems that selecting pairs of identical elements from each half can work, especially since duplicates exist.

But I need a general approach that works for any n and k within the constraints.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and how it behaves with subsets.

Given that the total XOR of all elements is zero, and the XOR of the first half equals the XOR of the second half, maybe I can find a subset of elements in the first half and a corresponding subset in the second half such that their XORs are equal.

But finding subsets with equal XORs sounds like it could be related to the subset XOR problem, which is NP-complete in general. However, given the constraints and the fact that it's guaranteed to have a solution, there might be a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice, and n can be up to 5*10^4, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) per test case or better.

I need to find 2k elements from each half with equal XOR.

Wait, since k can be up to n/2, and n can be up to 5*10^4, I need an approach that is linear or nearly linear in n.

Let me consider that I can select k pairs of identical elements, one from each half, and include them in l and r.

Wait, but k can be up to n/2, so up to n elements, but I need to select 2k elements from each half.

Wait, but each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, so if I select a number from the first half, its pair must be in the second half.

Wait, no. The problem doesn't specify which half the duplicates are in; they could be in the same half or split between the halves.

Wait, actually, since the array is divided into two halves, the duplicates of a number could be both in the first half, both in the second half, or one in each half.

But given that, I need to consider how to select elements for l and r.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I select some elements for l and corresponding elements for r such that their XORs match.

But how?

Another idea: since the total XOR of the first half equals the total XOR of the second half, and I need XOR(l) = XOR(r), perhaps I can select subsets such that the XOR of the remaining elements in each half also equals each other.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's consider that the XOR of the first half is XOR(b), and the XOR of the second half is XOR(c), and XOR(b) = XOR(c).

Now, if I select a subset l from b with XOR(l), then the XOR of the remaining elements in b is XOR(b) XOR XOR(l).

Similarly, if I select a subset r from c with XOR(r), the XOR of the remaining elements in c is XOR(c) XOR XOR(r).

Since XOR(b) = XOR(c), and XOR(l) = XOR(r), then XOR(b) XOR XOR(l) = XOR(c) XOR XOR(r), which implies that the XOR of the remaining elements in b equals the XOR of the remaining elements in c.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider that I need to select 2k elements from each half, and I need to maximize or minimize something, but no, just to make sure their XORs are equal.

Given that, perhaps I can select elements in pairs, ensuring that their combined XOR contributes equally to l and r.

But this seems vague.

Let me think about smaller examples.

Take n=2, k=1:

a = [1,2,2,1]

First half: [1,2], second half: [2,1]

XOR of first half: 1 XOR 2 = 3

XOR of second half: 2 XOR 1 = 3

Choose l = [2,1], r = [2,1], XOR = 3

Alternatively, l = [1,2], r = [1,2], XOR = 3

Or l = [2,2], r = [1,1], XOR = 0 (but k=1 requires 2 elements, so [2,2] and [1,1] are valid)

Wait, but in this case, [2,2] and [1,1] have XOR 0 and 0, which are equal.

So, that works.

Another example:

n=4, k=1

a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

First half: [1,2,3,4], second half: [1,2,3,4]

Possible l = [1,2], r = [1,2], XOR = 3

Or l = [1,1], r = [2,2], XOR = 0

But k=1 requires 2 elements.

So, in this case, selecting [1,1] and [2,2] is valid, as their XORs are both 0.

Wait, but 1 XOR 1 = 0, and 2 XOR 2 = 0.

So, that works.

Another example:

n=6, k=1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

First half: [6,4,2,1,2,3], second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

XOR of first half: 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = (6 XOR 4) XOR (2 XOR 2) XOR (1 XOR 3) = 2 XOR 0 XOR 2 = 0

XOR of second half: 1 XOR 6 XOR 3 XOR 5 XOR 5 XOR 4 = (1 XOR 6) XOR (3 XOR 3) XOR (5 XOR 5) XOR 4 = 7 XOR 0 XOR 0 XOR 4 = 7 XOR 4 = 3

Wait, but according to earlier note, XOR of first half should equal XOR of second half.

But in this case, it's not matching. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Let me recalculate:

First half: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

6 XOR 4 = 2

2 XOR 2 = 0

0 XOR 1 = 1

1 XOR 3 = 2

So, XOR of first half is 2.

Second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

1 XOR 6 = 7

7 XOR 3 = 4

4 XOR 5 = 1

1 XOR 5 = 4

4 XOR 4 = 0

Wait, but according to the problem, XOR of first half should equal XOR of second half.

But here, XOR first half is 2, and second half is 0.

But in the problem's example, they chose l=[6,4], r=[1,3], XOR(l)=6 XOR 4=2, XOR(r)=1 XOR 3=2.

So, in this case, XOR of first half is 2, and XOR of second half is 2 (since XOR(b)=XOR(c)).

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, in the first half:

6 XOR 4 = 2

2 XOR 2 = 0

0 XOR 1 = 1

1 XOR 2 = 3

3 XOR 3 = 0

Wait, no, the first half has [6,4,2,1,2,3], so:

6 XOR 4 = 2

2 XOR 2 = 0

0 XOR 1 = 1

1 XOR 2 = 3

3 XOR 3 = 0

Wait, but the array has [6,4,2,1,2,3], so XOR is 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3.

Let me compute step by step:

6 XOR 4 = 2

2 XOR 2 = 0

0 XOR 1 = 1

1 XOR 2 = 3

3 XOR 3 = 0

Wait, but the array is [6,4,2,1,2,3], so the XOR is 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0.

Similarly, second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

1 XOR 6 = 7

7 XOR 3 = 4

4 XOR 5 = 1

1 XOR 5 = 4

4 XOR 4 = 0

So, both halves have XOR 0.

But in the example, they chose l=[6,4], r=[1,3], which have XOR 2 and 2 respectively.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the XOR of the entire first half is 0, and second half is 0, but they chose subsets with XOR 2.

How does that fit?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the XOR of l is equal to the XOR of r, regardless of the total XOR of the halves.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that at least one pair exists, so maybe my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the XOR of l and r should be equal, and that's all.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that I need to select 2k elements from the first half and 2k elements from the second half such that their XORs are equal.

Given that, perhaps I can select k pairs of elements from each half, where the pairs have the same XOR.

Wait, but k can be up to n/2, and n can be up to 5*10^4, so I need an efficient way.

Another idea: since the total XOR of the first half equals the total XOR of the second half, perhaps I can select subsets such that their XORs are equal to some value, and the remaining elements also have equal XORs.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that I can select elements for l and r in such a way that their XORs are equal.

One possible approach is to select elements for l and r in pairs, ensuring that their XOR contributions are equal.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that I can select elements for l and r independently, as long as their XORs match.

But with constraints on which elements can be selected from which half.

Given time constraints, I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider that I can select elements for l and r in such a way that for each element in l, there is a corresponding element in r that balances the XOR.

But I need to think about how to implement this efficiently.

An alternative approach: since the total XOR of both halves is equal, and I need to select subsets l and r with equal XOR, perhaps I can select subsets such that the XOR difference between the subsets and the remaining elements is equal.

Wait, that might be too complicated.

Let me consider that I can select any 2k elements from the first half for l and any 2k elements from the second half for r, as long as their XORs are equal.

But with n up to 5*10^4, I need an efficient way to find such subsets.

This seems challenging.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I need to select 2k elements from each half, perhaps I can look at the frequencies and select elements accordingly.

Wait, but each number appears exactly twice, once in each half or both in the same half.

I need to consider both cases.

Let me try to categorize the numbers based on where their duplicates are located.

Case 1: Both duplicates are in the first half.

Case 2: Both duplicates are in the second half.

Case 3: One duplicate is in the first half, and the other is in the second half.

In case 1, if I select both duplicates for l, their XOR is zero.

Similarly, in case 2, selecting both duplicates for r gives XOR zero.

In case 3, selecting one for l and one for r, their XOR would be equal since they are the same number.

Wait, but x XOR x = 0.

Wait, but if I select one duplicate for l and one for r, their XOR would be x XOR x = 0.

But I need to select 2k elements, not just any number.

Wait, perhaps I can consider selecting pairs of identical elements, one for l and one for r, and their XOR contributions would cancel out.

But I need to select 2k elements for l and 2k for r.

Wait, maybe I can select k pairs of identical elements, one from each half, and include them in l and r, ensuring that their XOR contributions are equal.

But I need to select 2k elements for l and r each, which would mean selecting k pairs, each contributing zero to the XOR.

But if I select k pairs, each contributing zero, then the total XOR would be zero for both l and r.

But in the example, sometimes the XOR is not zero.

So, perhaps zero is a special case.

Wait, in the first test case, l=[2,1], r=[2,1], XOR=3.

In the second test case, l=[6,4], r=[1,3], XOR=2.

In the third test case, l=[1,2], r=[1,2], XOR=3.

In the fourth test case, l=[5,1,3,3], r=[6,4,2,4], XOR=4.

So, in these examples, the XOR is not necessarily zero.

Therefore, selecting pairs that cancel out might not be sufficient.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, l=[5,1,3,3], r=[6,4,2,4], XOR=4.

Here, 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 4, and 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 4.

So, their XORs match, but it's not zero.

So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me consider that I can select elements for l and r such that the XOR difference between l and r is zero.

But I need to find a way to select elements to achieve that.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that I can select elements for l and r in such a way that for each element in l, there is a corresponding element in r that makes their XOR equal.

But I need to think about how to implement this efficiently.

An alternative idea: since the total XOR of both halves is equal, and I need to select subsets with equal XOR, perhaps I can select subsets such that the XOR of l is equal to the XOR of r, which should be equal to the XOR of the remaining elements in both halves.

Wait, but that might not help directly.

Let me think about linear algebra over GF(2).

Each element can be considered as a vector in a vector space over GF(2), and XOR is the vector addition.

Then, finding subsets with a specific XOR is equivalent to finding subsets that sum to a specific vector.

But with n up to 5*10^4, this approach would be too slow.

I need something more efficient.

Let me consider that since k can be up to n/2, and n can be up to 5*10^4, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

Let me consider sorting the arrays.

If I sort both halves, maybe I can select elements in a systematic way.

Wait, in the provided code, they sort both halves.

Let me look at the provided code to understand their approach.

The code does the following:

- Read the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the array a of length 2n.

- Split a into b (first n elements) and c (last n elements).

- Sort both b and c.

- Initialize empty lists for l and r.

- Set k to 2k.

- Initialize a list l.

- Check if the first two elements of b are different; if so, append the first element to l.

- Check if the last two elements of b are different; if so, append the last element to l; else, append the last element twice to ans1 and decrease k by 2.

- Then, iterate through b from index 1 to n-2:

- If k == 0, break.

- If b[i] == b[i-1], append b[i] twice to ans1 and decrease k by 2.

- Else if b[i] != b[i+1], append b[i] to l.

- Set k back to 2k.

- Then, iterate through c from index 1 to n-1:

- If k == 0, break.

- If c[i] == c[i-1], append c[i] twice to ans2 and decrease k by 2.

- Then, iterate through the list l:

- If k == 0, break.

- Append l[i] to ans1 and ans2, decrease k by 1.

- Print ans1 and ans2.

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted.

Let me try to understand what this code is doing.

It sorts both halves, b and c.

Then, it tries to build ans1 and ans2 by selecting pairs of identical elements from b and c.

But I'm not sure if this guarantees that the XORs will be equal.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=2, k=1:

a = [1,2,2,1]

b = [1,2], c = [2,1]

After sorting: b = [1,2], c = [1,2]

Set k=2.

Initialize ans1 and ans2 as empty.

Check if b[0] != b[1]: 1 != 2, so append b[0]=1 to l.

Check if b[n-2] != b[n-1]: 2 != 1, so append b[n-1]=1 to l.

Now, l = [1,1]

Then, iterate through b from i=1 to n-2 (i=1 to 0, which is empty), so nothing happens.

Set k=2 again.

Then, iterate through c from i=1 to n-1 (i=1):

c[1]=2 == c[0]=1? No, so don't append.

Then, iterate through l (which is [1,1]):

Append l[0]=1 to ans1 and ans2, k=1

Append l[1]=1 to ans1 and ans2, k=0

So, ans1=[1,1], ans2=[1,1]

XOR of ans1: 1 XOR 1 = 0

XOR of ans2: 1 XOR 1 = 0

Which matches.

But according to the example, they chose [2,1] and [2,1], which also matches.

So, in this case, it works.

Another example:

n=6, k=1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

b = [6,4,2,1,2,3], c = [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Sort b: [1,2,2,3,4,6]

Sort c: [1,3,4,5,5,6]

Set k=2.

Check b[0] != b[1]: 1 != 2, append 1 to l.

Check b[n-2] != b[n-1]: 4 != 6, append 6 to l.

Now, l = [1,6]

Then, iterate through b from i=1 to n-2 (i=1 to 4):

i=1: b[1]=2 == b[0]=1? No, and b[1]!=b[2]=2, so append 2 to l.

i=2: b[2]=2 == b[1]=2, append 2,2 to ans1, k=0

Stop.

Set k=2.

Then, iterate through c from i=1 to n-1 (i=1 to 5):

i=1: c[1]=3 != c[0]=1, don't append.

i=2: c[2]=4 != c[1]=3, don't append.

i=3: c[3]=5 == c[4]=5, append 5,5 to ans2, k=0

Stop.

Then, iterate through l=[1,6,2]:

k=0, so stop.

So, ans1=[2,2,1,6], ans2=[5,5]

Wait, but ans1 has 4 elements, ans2 has 2 elements, but k=1 requires 2 elements each.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, k=1, so 2k=2, but in this case, ans1 has 2 elements, ans2 has 2 elements.

Wait, but in the code, it's appending l[i] to ans1 and ans2 for each l[i], but in this case, l has [1,6,2], but k is 0 after appending [2,2] to ans1 and [5,5] to ans2.

Wait, perhaps I need to trace the code more carefully.

In the code:

- After processing b, l = [1,6,2]

- Set k=2

- Process c:

- i=1: c[1]=3 != c[0]=1, don't append.

- i=2: c[2]=4 != c[1]=3, don't append.

- i=3: c[3]=5 == c[4]=5, append 5,5 to ans2, k=0

- Stop.

- Then, iterate through l=[1,6,2]:

- k=0, so stop.

- Print ans1 and ans2.

But in the example, they chose l=[6,4], r=[1,3]

So, perhaps this approach doesn't always choose the same subsets, but as long as the XORs match, it's acceptable.

In this case, ans1=[2,2], ans2=[5,5]

XOR of [2,2] is 0, XOR of [5,5] is 0, which matches.

So, it's a valid solution.

Another test case:

n=4, k=1

a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

b = [1,2,3,4], c = [1,2,3,4]

Sort b: [1,2,3,4], c: [1,2,3,4]

Set k=2.

Check b[0] != b[1]: 1 != 2, append 1 to l.

Check b[2] != b[3]: 3 != 4, append 4 to l.

Now, l=[1,4]

Then, iterate through b from i=1 to 2:

i=1: b[1]=2 == b[0]=1? No, and b[1]!=b[2]=3, append 2 to l.

i=2: b[2]=3 == b[1]=2? No, and b[2]!=b[3]=4, append 3 to l.

Now, l=[1,4,2,3]

Then, iterate through c from i=1 to 3:

i=1: c[1]=2 != c[0]=1, don't append.

i=2: c[2]=3 != c[1]=2, don't append.

i=3: c[3]=4 != c[2]=3, don't append.

Set k=2.

Then, iterate through l=[1,4,2,3]:

Append l[0]=1 to ans1 and ans2, k=1

Append l[1]=4 to ans1 and ans2, k=0

So, ans1=[1,4], ans2=[1,4]

XOR of [1,4] is 5, XOR of [1,4] is 5, which matches.

So, again, a valid solution.

Last test case:

n=6, k=2

a = [5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

b = [5,1,3,3,5,1], c = [2,6,4,6,4,2]

Sort b: [1,1,3,3,5,5], c: [2,2,4,4,6,6]

Set k=4.

Check b[0] != b[1]: 1 == 1, don't append.

Check b[n-2] != b[n-1]: 5 == 5, don't append.

So, l is empty.

Then, iterate through b from i=1 to n-2 (i=1 to 4):

i=1: b[1]=1 == b[0]=1, append 1,1 to ans1, k=2

i=2: b[2]=3 != b[1]=1, and b[2]!=b[3]=3, append 3 to l.

i=3: b[3]=3 == b[2]=3, append 3,3 to ans1, k=0

Stop.

Now, ans1=[1,1,3,3], l=[3]

Set k=4.

Then, iterate through c from i=1 to n-1 (i=1 to 5):

i=1: c[1]=2 == c[0]=2, append 2,2 to ans2, k=2

i=2: c[2]=4 != c[1]=2, don't append.

i=3: c[3]=4 == c[4]=4, append 4,4 to ans2, k=0

Stop.

Then, iterate through l=[3]:

k=0, so stop.

So, ans1=[1,1,3,3], ans2=[2,2,4,4]

XOR of [1,1,3,3] is 0, XOR of [2,2,4,4] is 0, which matches.

But in the example, they chose l=[5,1,3,3], r=[6,4,2,4], XOR=4.

So, their choice has XOR=4, while this code chooses XOR=0, which is also acceptable since XOR(l)=XOR(r).

Hence, this approach seems to work.

So, what is this approach doing?

It seems to select pairs of identical elements from each half and include them in ans1 and ans2, ensuring that their XORs are equal.

Additionally, it handles single elements that appear only once in the half by collecting them in list l and then pairing them between ans1 and ans2.

Let me try to understand the logic.

First, it sorts both halves.

Then, it tries to collect elements that appear only once in the first half into list l.

For example, in the first test case, b=[1,2], both elements are unique in b, so l=[1,2].

In the second test case, b=[1,2,2,3,4,6], so 2 appears twice, and others appear once, so l=[1,3,4,6].

Wait, in the earlier trace, l=[1,6,2,3].

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the code again.

Looking back at the code:

- If b[0] != b[1], append b[0] to l.

- If b[n-2] != b[n-1], append b[n-1] to l.

- Else (if b[n-2] == b[n-1]), append b[n-1] twice to ans1 and decrease k by 2.

- Then, iterate from i=1 to n-2:

- If k == 0, break.

- If b[i] == b[i-1], append b[i] twice to ans1 and decrease k by 2.

- Else if b[i] != b[i+1], append b[i] to l.

Then, set k back to 2k.

Then, iterate through c from i=1 to n-1:

- If k == 0, break.

- If c[i] == c[i-1], append c[i] twice to ans2 and decrease k by 2.

Finally, iterate through l:

- If k == 0, break.

- Append l[i] to ans1 and ans2, decrease k by 1.

So, it seems to prioritize selecting pairs of identical elements from b and c, and then handle single elements by adding them to both ans1 and ans2.

This ensures that their XOR contributions cancel out.

In the case where pairs are selected from b and c, their XOR is zero, and adding the same elements to ans1 and ans2 ensures that their XORs remain equal.

In the case where single elements are added to both ans1 and ans2, their XOR contributions are the same in both, so the overall XORs remain equal.

Hence, this approach seems to maintain the equality of XORs between ans1 and ans2.

Given that, and seeing that it works in the examples I traced, I conclude that this program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
