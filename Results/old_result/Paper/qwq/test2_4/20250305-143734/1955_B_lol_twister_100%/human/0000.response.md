Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there's this thing called a "progressive square" which is an n x n matrix. Maxim chooses three integers: a_{1,1}, c, and d, and constructs this square based on some rules. The example given is for n=3, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, and d=3, and it shows what the square looks like.

But wait, the problem doesn't explicitly state the rules for constructing the progressive square. It just mentions that there's a progressive square constructed based on a_{1,1}, c, and d, and that for any values of n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there exists exactly one such square.

Then, last month, Maxim constructed such a square and remembered n, c, and d. He found an array of n^2 integers in random order and wants to check if these elements match the elements of that specific square.

It also mentions that for any values of n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there exists exactly one progressive square satisfying the rules, which suggests that given n, c, and d, the square is uniquely determined.

In the input, we have multiple test cases. Each test case starts with t, the number of test cases. Then for each test case, there are three integers: n, c, and d, followed by a list of n^2 integers, which is the array b that Maxim found.

Our task is to determine, for each test case, whether the array b contains exactly the elements of the progressive square for the given n, c, and d.

First, I need to understand how the progressive square is constructed from a_{1,1}, c, and d.

Looking back at the example:

n = 3, a_{1,1} = 1, c = 2, d = 3

The square is:

1, 3, 6

5, 7, 10

4, 1, 8

Wait, that doesn't seem to follow a clear pattern based on c and d.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the square.

Looking back at the problem, it says:

"For example, if n = 3, a_{1,1} = 1, c=2, and d=3, then the progressive square looks as follows:"

But in the provided code, there's no explicit description of how the square is constructed.

Wait, perhaps I need to figure out the construction rule based on the given code.

Looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):

a = min(l)

li = []

for k in range(0, n):

for h in range(0, n):

li.append(a + k * c + d * h)

li.sort()

l.sort()

if l == li:

return 'yes'

return 'no'

So, the function func_1 seems to be constructing a list li based on a, c, d, and n, where a is the minimum value in l.

It's generating a list of elements that should be in the progressive square and comparing it to the sorted array l.

If they match, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, 'no'.

But is this correct?

I need to verify if this approach accurately determines whether the array b contains the elements of the progressive square.

First, I need to understand how the progressive square is constructed.

Given that a_{1,1} is chosen, along with c and d, and that there's exactly one such square for given n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there must be a specific formula to generate each element of the square.

Looking at the code, it seems to assume that the elements of the square can be generated by starting from a (which is min(l)) and then adding k*c + h*d for each position (k, h) in the matrix.

Wait, but is this how the progressive square is constructed?

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the progressive square is constructed such that each row and each column follows a specific arithmetic progression based on c and d.

For example, each row increases by c, and each column increases by d, or something similar.

Wait, in the example given:

n=3, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, d=3

Let's assume that each element a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d

So, a_{1,1} = 1

a_{1,2} = 1 + 0*c + 1*d = 1 + 0*2 + 1*3 = 4

a_{1,3} = 1 + 0*2 + 2*3 = 7

a_{2,1} = 1 + 1*2 + 0*3 = 3

a_{2,2} = 1 + 1*2 + 1*3 = 6

a_{2,3} = 1 + 1*2 + 2*3 = 9

a_{3,1} = 1 + 2*2 + 0*3 = 5

a_{3,2} = 1 + 2*2 + 1*3 = 8

a_{3,3} = 1 + 2*2 + 2*3 = 11

So, the square would be:

1, 4, 7

3, 6, 9

5, 8, 11

But in the problem's example, it shows:

3, 9, 6

5, 7, 10

4, 1, 8

Wait, that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d + some adjustment.

Alternatively, maybe the progressive square is constructed differently.

Looking back at the code, it seems to generate the list li by taking a (min(l)) and adding k*c + h*d for each k and h.

But in my earlier assumption, a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d

In the code, it's a + k*c + h*d, where a = min(l), which might not be equal to a_{1,1}.

Wait, perhaps a = a_{1,1}.

But in the code, a is set to min(l), which is the minimum value in the array b, which is supposed to contain the elements of the progressive square.

Assuming that the array b contains exactly the elements of the progressive square, then min(l) should indeed be a_{1,1}.

But what if the array b contains extra elements or missing elements? That's why we're checking if l sorted is equal to li sorted.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed that l contains exactly n^2 integers, matching the size of the square.

So, we're to check if l contains exactly the elements of the progressive square for given n, c, d.

Assuming that a_{1,1} is equal to min(l), which seems reasonable if all elements are positive and constructed by adding non-negative multiples of c and d.

Wait, but c and d are given to be at least 1, as per the input constraints: 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6.

So, if a_{1,1} is the smallest element, and all other elements are a_{1,1} + some multiple of c and d, then yes, a_{1,1} should be equal to min(l).

Then, the rest of the elements should be exactly a_{1,1} + k*c + h*d for 0 ≤ k, h < n.

So, the code seems to be correctly generating the list li of expected elements and comparing it to the sorted l.

Therefore, the approach seems correct.

But let's verify with the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

5

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8

2 100 100

400 300 400 500

3 2 3

3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8

4 4 4

15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15

Sample Output:

NO

YES

YES

NO

NO

Let's take the first test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

l = [3,9,6,5,7,1,10,4,8]

According to the code:

a = min(l) = 1

Then, li = [1 + k*2 + h*3 for k in 0 to 2, h in 0 to 2]

So, for k=0, h=0: 1 + 0*2 + 0*3 = 1

k=0, h=1: 1 + 0*2 + 1*3 = 4

k=0, h=2: 1 + 0*2 + 2*3 = 7

k=1, h=0: 1 + 1*2 + 0*3 = 3

k=1, h=1: 1 + 1*2 + 1*3 = 6

k=1, h=2: 1 + 1*2 + 2*3 = 9

k=2, h=0: 1 + 2*2 + 0*3 = 5

k=2, h=1: 1 + 2*2 + 1*3 = 8

k=2, h=2: 1 + 2*2 + 2*3 = 11

So, li = [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11]

Sorted li: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

Sorted l: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Comparing sorted li and sorted l: they differ (11 vs 10), so output "NO", which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

l = [3,9,6,5,7,1,11,4,8]

a = min(l) = 1

li = same as above: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

sorted l: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

li == l: yes, so output "YES", matching the sample.

Third test case:

n=2, c=100, d=100

l = [400,300,400,500]

a = min(l) = 300

li = [300 + k*100 + h*100 for k=0 to 1, h=0 to 1]

k=0,h=0: 300 +0+0 = 300

k=0,h=1: 300 +0+100 = 400

k=1,h=0: 300 +100+0 = 400

k=1,h=1: 300 +100+100 = 500

li = [300,400,400,500]

sorted li: [300,400,400,500]

sorted l: [300,400,400,500]

match, so "YES"

Fourth test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

l = [3,9,6,6,5,1,11,4,8]

a = min(l) = 1

li = [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

sorted l: [1,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,9,11] Wait, no:

l has elements [3,9,6,6,5,1,11,4,8], which is 9 elements.

sorted l: [1,3,4,5,6,6,8,9,11]

sorted li: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

They differ (extra 6 in l), so "NO", matches sample.

Fifth test case:

n=4, c=4, d=4

l = [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

a = min(l) = 3

li = [3 + k*4 + h*4 for k=0 to 3, h=0 to 3]

k=0,h=0: 3+0+0=3

k=0,h=1: 3+0+4=7

k=0,h=2: 3+0+8=11

k=0,h=3: 3+0+12=15

k=1,h=0: 3+4+0=7

k=1,h=1: 3+4+4=11

k=1,h=2: 3+4+8=15

k=1,h=3: 3+4+12=19

k=2,h=0: 3+8+0=11

k=2,h=1: 3+8+4=15

k=2,h=2: 3+8+8=19

k=2,h=3: 3+8+12=23

k=3,h=0: 3+12+0=15

k=3,h=1: 3+12+4=19

k=3,h=2: 3+12+8=23

k=3,h=3: 3+12+12=27

li = [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27]

sorted li: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

sorted l: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,27]

Wait, l has elements [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

sorted l: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,27]

sorted li: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,27]

They match, so should output "YES", but the sample output is "NO". Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

l has elements: [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

Let's count:

15 appears 5 times

27 appears 1 time

7 appears 2 times

19 appears 2 times

23 appears 3 times

11 appears 3 times

3 appears 1 time

Total: 5+1+2+2+3+3+1=17, but n=4, n^2=16. Wait, the input says n=4, but l has 16 elements, but in the list, there are 17 numbers. Wait, checking the input:

"4 4 4

15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15"

Counting the numbers: 15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15 → that's 16 numbers.

But in my earlier counting, I miscounted.

Let's recount:

15 appears 5 times

27 appears 1 time

7 appears 2 times

19 appears 2 times

23 appears 3 times

11 appears 3 times

3 appears 1 time

Total: 5+1+2+2+3+3+1=17, but it should be 16. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the occurrences.

Let's list them:

Positions:

1. 15

2. 27

3. 7

4. 19

5. 23

6. 23

7. 11

8. 15

9. 7

10. 3

11. 19

12. 23

13. 11

14. 15

15. 11

16. 15

So:

15: positions 1,8,14,16 → 4 times

Wait, no, positions 1,8,14,16 are 15, and position 15 is 11.

Wait, positions:

1. 15

2. 27

3. 7

4. 19

5. 23

6. 23

7. 11

8. 15

9. 7

10. 3

11. 19

12. 23

13. 11

14. 15

15. 11

16. 15

So:

15: positions 1,8,14,16 → 4 times

27: position 2 → 1 time

7: positions 3,9 → 2 times

19: positions 4,11 → 2 times

23: positions 5,6,12 → 3 times

11: positions 7,13,15 → 3 times

3: position 10 → 1 time

Total: 4+1+2+2+3+3+1=16, which matches.

Now, li should be:

a = min(l) = 3

li = [3 + k*4 + h*4 for k=0 to 3, h=0 to 3]

As before:

k=0,h=0: 3

k=0,h=1: 7

k=0,h=2: 11

k=0,h=3: 15

k=1,h=0: 7

k=1,h=1: 11

k=1,h=2: 15

k=1,h=3: 19

k=2,h=0: 11

k=2,h=1: 15

k=2,h=2: 19

k=2,h=3: 23

k=3,h=0: 15

k=3,h=1: 19

k=3,h=2: 23

k=3,h=3: 27

So, li = [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27]

Counts in li:

3: 1

7: 2

11: 3

15: 4

19: 3

23: 2

27: 1

Counts in l:

15: 4

27: 1

7: 2

19: 2

23: 3

11: 3

3: 1

Wait, but according to my earlier count, l has:

15:4, 27:1, 7:2, 19:2, 23:3, 11:3, 3:1

And li has:

3:1, 7:2, 11:3, 15:4, 19:3, 23:2, 27:1

Comparing counts:

- 3: l has 1, li has 1

- 7: l has 2, li has 2

- 11: l has 3, li has 3

- 15: l has 4, li has 4

- 19: l has 2, li has 3

- 23: l has 3, li has 2

- 27: l has 1, li has 1

Wait, there's a mismatch: l has 2 19's, li has 3 19's; l has 3 23's, li has 2 23's.

Wait, but according to my earlier count, l has 19:2, li has 19:3.

But according to the list:

l: [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

19 appears at positions 4 and 11 → 2 times

li has 19 at positions k=1,h=3 and k=2,h=2 and k=3,h=1 → 3 times

So, counts don't match: l has 2, li has 3.

Hence, l is not equal to li, so should output "NO", which matches the sample.

Therefore, the code seems correct in its approach.

It correctly identifies whether the array l contains exactly the elements of the progressive square constructed using a_{1,1}=min(l), c, and d.

Hence, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
