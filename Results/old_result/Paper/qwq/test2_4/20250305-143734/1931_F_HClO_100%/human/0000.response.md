Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n people in a programming contest chat, ordered by their activity, but each person sees themselves at the top of the list. So, for example, if the actual order is [2, 3, 1, 4], then:

- User 1 sees [1, 2, 3, 4]

- User 2 sees [2, 3, 1, 4]

- User 3 sees [3, 2, 1, 4]

- User 4 sees [4, 2, 3, 1]

Got it. So, k people posted screenshots of the order they saw, and I need to determine if there's a single actual order that could correspond to all these screenshots.

First, I need to understand how each user's view is constructed. Each user sees themselves at the top, followed by the actual order of the other users. So, for user x, their view is [x, followed by the actual order excluding x].

Given that, if I have multiple screenshots, I need to check if there's a consistent actual order that explains all these views.

Let's consider the example provided:

Input:

10

4 4

1 2 3 4

1 5 4 3 2

5 1 4 3 2

3 3

1 3 2

2 1 3

3 2 1

Output:

YES

YES

YES

YES

NO

YES

YES

YES

YES

NO

From this, I can see that in some cases, the answer is YES, and in others, it's NO. I need to find a way to determine when it's possible to have a single actual order that satisfies all the screenshots.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, if there's only one screenshot (k=1), then obviously, it's possible; I can just assume that the actual order is the one shown, with the user placing themselves at the top.

But when there are multiple screenshots, I need to see if there's a consistent actual order that can explain all of them.

Let's consider two screenshots:

- User A sees [A, B, C, D, ...]

- User B sees [B, C, A, D, ...]

From these, I can infer that in the actual order, A comes before B, because in User B's view, A comes after B.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

If User A sees [A, B, C, D], that means the actual order is [B, C, D], with A at the top.

If User B sees [B, C, A, D], that means the actual order is [C, A, D], with B at the top.

So, from User A's view, the order after A is B, C, D.

From User B's view, the order after B is C, A, D.

So, combining these, it seems that C comes before A in User B's view, which contradicts User A's view where B comes before C.

Wait, maybe I need to model this as a graph where the positions indicate the order.

Let me try to model this as a graph where edges represent the order between users.

Each user's view can be used to create ordering constraints.

For example, in User A's view:

- A is first

- Then B

- Then C

- Then D

In User B's view:

- B is first

- Then C

- Then A

- Then D

So, from User A's view:

- B comes before C

- C comes before D

From User B's view:

- C comes before A

- A comes before D

So, combining these:

- B before C (from A)

- C before A (from B)

- A before D (from B)

- C before D (from A)

Wait, from User A:

- B before C

- C before D

From User B:

- C before A

- A before D

So, the combined ordering is:

B -> C -> A -> D

This seems consistent.

Now, if I have another user's view, say User C:

- C is first

- Then B

- Then A

- Then D

From this:

- B before A

- A before D

Which is consistent with the above.

But if User C's view was:

- C is first

- Then A

- Then B

- Then D

Then:

- A before B

But earlier we had B before C and C before A, which would create a cycle: B -> C -> A -> B

This would be inconsistent.

So, in general, I need to build a graph where edges represent "comes before" relationships and check for cycles. If there's a cycle, it's impossible; otherwise, it's possible.

So, this seems like a topological sorting problem.

Each user's view imposes some ordering constraints.

I need to collect all these constraints and see if they can be satisfied by a single topological order.

Let me formalize this.

Let's treat the problem as constructing a directed graph where nodes are users, and edges represent the "comes before" relationship.

From each user's view, I can derive ordering between the users.

Specifically, for a user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], it implies:

- A comes before B

- B comes before C

- and so on

Also, since X sees themselves first, and others in the order A, B, C, ..., this implies that in the actual order, A comes before B, B before C, etc.

But I need to consider the positions relative to other users.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each user's view is a permutation of the actual order, with themselves moved to the top.

So, if the actual order is [O1, O2, O3, ..., On], and user X is in position k in this order, then user X's view would be [X, O1, O2, ..., Ok-1, Ok+1, ..., On].

Wait, no. From the example:

Actual order: [2, 3, 1, 4]

User 1 sees: [1, 2, 3, 4]

User 2 sees: [2, 3, 1, 4]

User 3 sees: [3, 2, 1, 4]

User 4 sees: [4, 2, 3, 1]

So, for user X, their view is [X, followed by the actual order excluding X].

So, in general, for user X, their view is [X] + [actual order excluding X].

Given that, if I have multiple screenshots, each showing [A, B, C, D, ...], I can infer the relative positions in the actual order.

To find if there's a consistent actual order that satisfies all these views, I can model this as a graph where edges represent "comes before" relationships.

For each user's view, I can derive ordering constraints.

Specifically, for user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], it implies:

- A comes before B

- B comes before C

- and so on

But I need to be careful because each user sees themselves at the top, followed by the actual order of others.

So, for two users, their views might overlap in terms of the ordering of others, and I need to ensure that these overlapping parts are consistent.

This sounds like building a graph where nodes are users, and directed edges represent "comes before" relationships.

Then, if there are no cycles in this graph, a topological order exists that satisfies all the constraints.

So, my plan is:

1. For each screenshot, extract the ordering constraints.

2. Build a directed graph based on these constraints.

3. Check if the graph has a topological order, i.e., no cycles.

If there are no cycles, output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

But let's see how to implement this efficiently, given the constraints:

- t test cases

- n can be up to 2e5

- k can be up to n, and n*k <= 2e5

So, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to handle the cases where m (k) is 1 or 2 separately, and then generalizes for more screenshots.

Let me try to understand the provided code.

The function `func` reads t, the number of test cases, and then loops through each test case.

For each test case, it reads n and m (k).

If m is 1, it directly prints 'yes', which makes sense because with only one screenshot, there's no conflict.

Then, it reads the first two screenshots: l1 and l2, corresponding to a1 and a2.

It processes l1 and l2 to remove a2 and a1 respectively, and checks if the remaining lists are equal.

If they are not equal, it reads the remaining m-2 screenshots and prints 'no'.

If they are equal, it proceeds to find the positions where a1 and a2 should be inserted.

It then inserts a2 into l1 or a1 into l2 at the appropriate positions, based on the indices idx1 and idx2.

After that, it reads the remaining m-2 screenshots and checks if their views match the constructed actual order.

Finally, if all checks pass, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, 'no'.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me think about this again.

Each user's view is [user, followed by the actual order minus the user].

So, if I have multiple such views, I need to see if there's a consistent actual order that can produce all these views.

One way to approach this is to treat the problem as merging multiple permutations, each modified by moving a different element to the front.

I need to find if there's a original permutation such that, for each user, moving that user to the front gives the observed permutation.

This sounds similar to checking the consistency of partial orders.

An efficient way to do this is to indeed build a graph of "comes before" relationships and check for cycles.

Let me try to formalize this.

For each screenshot, which represents user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], I can infer:

- X comes before A in the actual order

- A comes before B

- B comes before C

- and so on

Wait, no. Actually, in user X's view, X is at the front, followed by the actual order minus X.

So, in the actual order, the positions of A, B, C, ... should be in the same relative order as in user X's view, but with X removed.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of pairwise comparisons.

For example, if user X sees A next, that means A is the first in the actual order excluding X.

Similarly, if user Y sees B next, B is the first in the actual order excluding Y.

So, I can create constraints based on these positions.

But this seems a bit messy.

Let me consider that the actual order is some permutation P = [P1, P2, ..., Pn].

Each user X sees [X, followed by P minus X].

So, for user X, their view is [X, P1 (if P1 != X), P2 (if P2 != X), ..., Pn (if Pn != X)].

Given that, if I have two users, X and Y, their views are:

- X's view: [X, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus X]

- Y's view: [Y, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus Y]

So, the views differ only in the position of X and Y.

So, perhaps I can find the position where X and Y should be placed relative to each other.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a graph where nodes are users, and edges indicate the relative order between users.

For example, if user X sees Y after X, that means in the actual order, Y comes after X.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

If user X sees Y at position k, that means in the actual order, Y is at position k-1 (since X is at position 1 in their view).

Wait, no.

Wait, in user X's view:

- Position 1: X

- Position 2: P1 (if P1 != X)

- Position 3: P2 (if P2 != X)

- and so on

Similarly, in user Y's view:

- Position 1: Y

- Position 2: P1 (if P1 != Y)

- Position 3: P2 (if P2 != Y)

- and so on

So, the actual order P is [P1, P2, ..., Pn], and user X's view is [X, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus X].

Similarly for user Y.

So, to find inconsistencies, I need to see if the positions of users in each other's views are consistent.

This seems complicated.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I fix the actual order P = [P1, P2, ..., Pn].

Then, for any user X, their view would be [X, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus X].

Given that, if I have multiple such views, I can try to find a P that satisfies all of them.

This sounds like solving a system of equations, where each equation corresponds to a user's view.

But that might not be efficient.

An alternative approach is to consider that the difference between the actual order P and user X's view is just moving X to the front.

So, if I have two user's views, say user X and user Y, then:

- User X's view: [X, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus X]

- User Y's view: [Y, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus Y]

Comparing these two, the only difference should be the positions of X and Y.

So, in general, for any two users X and Y, their views should differ only in the positions of X and Y.

In other words, if I remove X and Y from both views, the remaining sequences should be identical.

Wait, let's check that with the example.

Take n=4, m=4:

Actual order: [2,3,1,4]

User 1 sees: [1,2,3,4]

User 2 sees: [2,3,1,4]

User 3 sees: [3,2,1,4]

User 4 sees: [4,2,3,1]

Now, comparing User 1 and User 2:

User 1: [1,2,3,4]

User 2: [2,3,1,4]

If I remove 1 and 2 from both, I get [3,4] and [3,4], which match.

Similarly, comparing User 1 and User 3:

User 1: [1,2,3,4]

User 3: [3,2,1,4]

Remove 1 and 3: [2,4] and [2,4], which match.

Similarly for others.

So, in general, for any two users, if I remove both of them from their views, the remaining sequences should be the same.

Moreover, the positions of each other in their views should be consistent.

So, perhaps I can proceed as follows:

- Choose one user's view as the reference actual order.

- For each other user's view, compare it to the reference, adjusting for the positions of the users.

- Check for consistency.

But this might not be efficient for large n and m.

An alternative approach is to model this as a graph where nodes are users, and edges represent the relative order between users.

For example, if user X sees user Y at position k, and user Y sees user X at position l, then there should be a consistent ordering that satisfies both.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on pairs.

For each pair of users, determine their relative order based on their views and see if these relative orders are consistent across all pairs.

This sounds like building a graph where edges indicate "comes before" relationships.

Then, I can check if this graph is acyclic, which would mean there exists a topological order that satisfies all the constraints.

If there's a cycle, it means there's a contradiction in the ordering, and the answer is "NO".

Otherwise, it's "YES".

This seems promising.

Let me try to implement this logic.

So, for each screenshot, I can derive ordering constraints.

Specifically, for user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], it implies:

- A comes before B

- B comes before C

- and so on

Additionally, since X is at the top, it implies that X comes before A, A comes before B, etc.

But I need to be careful because each user's view is based on the actual order, with themselves moved to the front.

So, perhaps a better way is to consider that for any two users, their relative order is determined by their positions in the actual order, unless one of them is the viewer, in which case the viewer is moved to the front.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that for any two users, X and Y, in most views, their relative order should match the actual order, except in the view of X or Y, where X or Y is moved to the front.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to formalize the constraints.

Suppose the actual order is P = [P1, P2, ..., Pn].

Then, for any user X, their view is [X, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus X].

So, in user X's view, the order of users excluding X should match the actual order.

Therefore, for any two users Y and Z, if Y comes before Z in the actual order, then in user X's view (for any X), if both Y and Z are present, their relative order should be Y before Z, unless X is Y or X is Z.

Wait, no.

In user X's view:

- If X is Y, then Y is at the front, followed by the actual order minus Y.

- If X is Z, then Z is at the front, followed by the actual order minus Z.

- If X is neither Y nor Z, then the order of Y and Z should match the actual order.

So, to ensure consistency, for any two users Y and Z, the relative order of Y and Z in the views where neither is the viewer should match the actual order.

Moreover, in the views where one of them is the viewer, their position is moved to the front, which affects the relative order.

This seems tricky to handle directly.

An alternative approach is to note that the difference between the actual order and each user's view is only the position of the user themselves.

So, if I have multiple views, I can try to reconstruct the actual order by fixing one user's view as the actual order and then checking if the other views are consistent with that.

For example, suppose I choose user A's view as the actual order.

Then, for user B's view, I can see if moving B to the front of the actual order matches user B's view.

If it does for all users, then it's consistent.

This seems promising.

Let's try this with an example.

Suppose n=3, m=3:

User 1: [1,2,3]

User 2: [2,1,3]

User 3: [3,1,2]

If I choose user 1's view as the actual order: [1,2,3]

Then, for user 2's view: moving 2 to the front should give [2,1,3], which matches.

For user 3's view: moving 3 to the front should give [3,1,2], which also matches.

So, it's consistent.

Another example:

n=3, m=3:

User 1: [1,2,3]

User 2: [2,3,1]

User 3: [3,2,1]

If I choose user 1's view as actual order: [1,2,3]

Then, for user 2: moving 2 to the front should give [2,1,3], but user 2's view is [2,3,1], which doesn't match.

So, inconsistent.

Hence, by choosing one user's view as the actual order and checking if moving other users to the front produces their views, I can check for consistency.

This seems efficient.

So, in code, I can:

- Choose the first user's view as the actual order.

- For each other user's view, construct what their view should be if the actual order is the chosen one.

- Check if this matches their actual view.

- If all match, output "YES"; else, "NO".

Wait, but in the provided code, it seems to handle m=1 and m=2 separately and does some index manipulation.

I think my approach is simpler and more efficient.

Let me try implementing it.

So, for each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read m screenshots: each starts with the user ID, followed by the order they see.

- Choose one user's view as the actual order.

- For each other user's view, construct what their view should be based on the actual order.

- Check if it matches their provided view.

- If all match, "YES"; else, "NO".

But I need to be careful with the construction.

Let me write some pseudocode.

Choose user A's view as the actual order.

For each other user B:

- Construct B's view by moving B to the front of the actual order.

- Check if this matches the provided view of B.

If all match, "YES"; else, "NO".

This should work.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to map user IDs to their positions in the actual order.

Let me think about data structures.

Suppose I choose user A's view as the actual order: [A, B, C, D, ...]

Then, create a dictionary or list to store the positions of each user in this order.

Then, for each other user B:

- Create B's view by moving B to the front: [B] + [actual order minus B]

- Check if this matches the provided view of B.

If it does for all B, then "YES"; else, "NO".

This seems straightforward.

Let me consider the constraints.

n can be up to 2e5, and m up to n, with n*m <= 2e5.

So, time complexity should be O(n*m), which is acceptable.

But I need to optimize it.

In practice, reading input efficiently is crucial.

In Python, reading input efficiently can be a bottleneck for large n and m.

So, I need to read input in a fast way, perhaps using sys.stdin.read() and splitting it into tokens.

But since n and m can be up to 2e5, I need to handle input carefully.

Looking back at the provided code, it uses heapq, but I don't think it's necessary.

The provided code seems to handle m=1 and m=2 separately and does some index manipulation to find where to insert users.

I think my approach is simpler and more straightforward.

Let me try to implement it.

First, read t.

For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read m lines, each starting with the user ID, followed by the order they see.

- Store them in a list of lists.

- Choose the first user's view as the actual order.

- Create a position dictionary for fast lookups.

- For each other user's view:

- Construct what their view should be based on the actual order.

- Check if it matches the provided view.

- If all match, "YES"; else, "NO".

Edge cases to consider:

- m=1: trivially "YES".

- m=2: need to check if the two views are consistent.

- Duplicates: guaranteed that all users are different.

- Users are numbered from 1 to n.

- All a_ij are different in each screenshot.

- Authors of screenshots are different.

I need to make sure that the chosen actual order is consistent with all other views.

Let me try this approach with the example provided.

Test case:

n=4, m=4:

User 1: [1,2,3,4]

User 2: [2,3,1,4]

User 3: [3,2,1,4]

User 4: [4,2,3,1]

Choose user 1's view as actual order: [1,2,3,4]

Then, for user 2:

- Move 2 to the front: [2,1,3,4]

- Matches provided view: [2,3,1,4]

Wait, no. According to the problem, user 2 sees [2,3,1,4], which matches moving 2 to the front of the actual order [2,3,1,4].

Wait, but according to my approach, if actual order is [1,2,3,4], moving 2 to the front gives [2,1,3,4], but user 2's view is [2,3,1,4]. These are different.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust my approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconstruct the actual order based on one user's view and then adjust for others.

This seems more involved.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can collect all the positions of each user in all views and see if there's a consistent actual order.

But that might be too slow.

Another idea: since each user's view is the actual order with themselves moved to the front, the actual order can be reconstructed by fixing one user's view and then verifying the others.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the intersection of all views after removing the top element.

Let me try this.

For each screenshot, ignore the first element (the user themselves), and consider the remaining sequence.

Then, the intersection of all these sequences should be the actual order minus the users who took the screenshots.

But this might not work directly.

Let me consider that for any two users, their views should have the same order for the other users, except for their own positions.

This seems similar to checking the consistency of partial permutations.

I think the best way is to model this as a graph where edges represent "comes before" relationships and check for acyclicity.

Let me try to implement that.

So, for each screenshot, derive "comes before" relationships.

For example, in user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], it implies:

- A comes before B

- B comes before C

- and so on

Additionally, since X is at the front, it implies that X comes before A, A comes before B, etc.

So, for each screenshot, for each pair (A, B) where A is before B in the screenshot's view (excluding the user themselves), add an edge from A to B in the graph.

Then, check if the graph has a topological order.

If it does, output "YES"; else, "NO".

Wait, but this might not be entirely correct because each user's view is the actual order with themselves moved to the front.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the edges accordingly.

Let me think carefully.

Suppose the actual order is P = [P1, P2, ..., Pn].

Then, for user X, their view is [X, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus X].

So, in user X's view, P1 comes immediately after X, P2 comes after P1, and so on.

Therefore, for user X's view, I can derive edges:

- X -> P1

- P1 -> P2

- P2 -> P3

- and so on

Similarly, for other users' views, I can derive similar edges.

Then, I can build a directed graph with these edges and check if it's acyclic.

If it is, output "YES"; else, "NO".

This seems correct.

Let me try it with the example.

Test case:

n=4, m=4:

User 1: [1,2,3,4]

User 2: [2,3,1,4]

User 3: [3,2,1,4]

User 4: [4,2,3,1]

Edges from User 1:

1 -> 2

2 -> 3

3 -> 4

Edges from User 2:

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

1 -> 4

Edges from User 3:

3 -> 2

2 -> 1

1 -> 4

Edges from User 4:

4 -> 2

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

Now, the graph is:

1 -> 2

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

1 -> 4

4 -> 2

Wait, 3 -> 1 and 1 -> 2 and 2 -> 3 forms a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1

So, there's a cycle, which should lead to "NO".

But according to the example, the answer is "YES".

Wait, but in the example output, it's "YES" for this test case.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to exclude the user who took the screenshot when building the edges.

Wait, no, each user's view is [X, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus X], where P1, P2, Pn are the actual order minus X.

So, the edges should be P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> ... in the actual order.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the actual order P = [P1, P2, ..., Pn].

Then, for user X, their view is [X, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus X].

So, in user X's view, the relative order of P1, P2, P3, ... should be the same as in the actual order.

Therefore, for each user's view, the order of the users excluding themselves should match the actual order.

Hence, if I take the order of users excluding the user themselves from each view, they should all be the same.

Wait, that's a crucial insight.

So, for all users, if I remove themselves from their view, the remaining sequence should be the same.

In other words, all users see the actual order, with themselves moved to the front.

Therefore, if I remove the first element (the user themselves) from each view, all the remaining sequences should be identical.

If they are, then "YES"; else, "NO".

This seems much simpler.

Let me verify this with the example.

Test case:

n=4, m=4:

User 1: [1,2,3,4]

Remove 1: [2,3,4]

User 2: [2,3,1,4]

Remove 2: [3,1,4]

User 3: [3,2,1,4]

Remove 3: [2,1,4]

User 4: [4,2,3,1]

Remove 4: [2,3,1]

These sequences are not identical:

- [2,3,4]

- [3,1,4]

- [2,1,4]

- [2,3,1]

So, according to this, the answer should be "NO".

But in the example, it's "YES".

Wait, that means my assumption is incorrect.

So, perhaps there's more to it.

Looking back, perhaps I need to consider that the remaining sequences should be permutations of each other, but with some consistency in the order.

Wait, no, in the example, the answer is "YES", but according to my previous approach, it should be "NO", which is inconsistent.

Hence, my approach is flawed.

Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconstruct the actual order based on the intersections of the views.

Let me consider that the actual order is the intersection of all the views after removing the top element.

But I'm not sure.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to handle m=2 carefully, comparing the remaining lists after removing the authors, and then inserting the authors at appropriate positions.

This suggests that for m=2, it's checking where the two authors should be placed relative to each other.

Then, for m > 2, it's checking the consistency of the additional views with the constructed actual order.

This seems reasonable.

Perhaps I should follow a similar approach.

So, here's an outline:

- For m=1: always "YES"

- For m=2:

- Remove the authors from each other's views and see if the remaining lists match.

- If they do, then insert the authors into each other's views at the appropriate positions.

- For m > 2:

- Use the constructed actual order from m=2 and check if the additional views are consistent with it.

This seems similar to the provided code.

Let me try to implement this.

First, for m=2:

- Take the first two screenshots.

- Remove the author of the second screenshot from the first screenshot's view and vice versa.

- Check if the remaining lists match.

- If they do, insert the authors into each other's views at the correct positions to construct the actual order.

- Then, for m > 2, check if the remaining views match the constructed actual order.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to formalize it.

For m=2:

- User A's view: [A, B, C, D, ...]

- User B's view: [B, C, A, D, ...]

- Remove B from User A's view: [A, C, D, ...]

- Remove A from User B's view: [B, C, D, ...]

- Compare [A, C, D, ...] and [B, C, D, ...]: they differ only in the first element, which are A and B.

- So, the actual order should be [A, B, C, D, ...] or [B, A, C, D, ...], depending on where A and B are placed.

- Need to determine the correct positions of A and B relative to each other.

- If m=2, and the remaining lists match except for the positions of A and B, then it's possible to construct the actual order.

- If m > 2, need to check consistency with the additional views.

This seems similar to what the provided code is doing.

Given that, I can proceed to implement this logic.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that the actual order can be reconstructed by merging the views, considering that each view is the actual order with the user moved to the front.

So, it's similar to merging sorted lists where each list is the actual order with one element moved to the front.

This is akin to sorting with some known positions.

I think the provided code is trying to handle the relative positions of the authors in each other's views to reconstruct the actual order.

Given that, and considering time constraints, perhaps implementing the provided logic is the way to go.

However, the provided code seems a bit convoluted, and I'm not entirely sure about its correctness.

Given that, perhaps I should stick with the graph-based approach, where I build a "comes before" graph and check for acyclicity.

So, here's how I can implement it:

- For each screenshot, for each pair of users in the view (excluding the user themselves), add edges based on their positions.

- Specifically, for user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], add edges X->A, A->B, B->C, etc.

- Additionally, for each user Y who is not X, if Y is in the view, their position indicates where they should be in the actual order.

- But since each user's view is the actual order with themselves moved to the front, I need to adjust the edges accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I need to add edges based on the actual order.

Let me try to define it differently.

Suppose the actual order is P = [P1, P2, ..., Pn].

Then, for user X, their view is [X, P1, P2, ..., Pn minus X].

So, in user X's view, P1 comes immediately after X, P2 comes after P1, and so on.

Therefore, for user X's view, I can add edges:

- X -> P1

- P1 -> P2

- P2 -> P3

- and so on

Then, for all users' views, I collect all such edges and build a directed graph.

If this graph has a topological order, then "YES"; else, "NO".

Let me try this with the example where n=4, m=4:

User 1: [1,2,3,4]

Edges:

1 -> 2

2 -> 3

3 -> 4

User 2: [2,3,1,4]

Edges:

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

1 -> 4

User 3: [3,2,1,4]

Edges:

3 -> 2

2 -> 1

1 -> 4

User 4: [4,2,3,1]

Edges:

4 -> 2

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

Now, the graph is:

1 -> 2

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

1 -> 4

4 -> 2

This has a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1

Hence, it should be "NO", but in the example, it's "YES".

So, perhaps I'm adding too many edges.

Wait, maybe I need to exclude some edges.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider only the relative order of the users excluding the viewer.

Wait, perhaps I need to add edges only for the relative order of the users excluding the viewer.

So, for user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], the actual order is [A, B, C, ...], with X at the front.

Therefore, I can add edges A -> B, B -> C, etc., but not X -> A.

Wait, perhaps that's better.

So, for user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], add edges A -> B, B -> C, C -> D, etc.

Because in the actual order, A comes before B, B before C, and so on.

Similarly, for user Y's view [Y, B, A, C, ...], add edges B -> A, A -> C, etc.

Then, check if these edges form a consistent order.

Let me try this with the example:

User 1: [1,2,3,4]

Add edges: 2 -> 3 -> 4

User 2: [2,3,1,4]

Add edges: 3 -> 1 -> 4

User 3: [3,2,1,4]

Add edges: 2 -> 1 -> 4

User 4: [4,2,3,1]

Add edges: 2 -> 3 -> 1

Now, the graph is:

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

1 -> 4

2 -> 1

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

So, combining all, we have:

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

1 -> 4

2 -> 1

This has a cycle: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2

Hence, "NO", but the example output is "YES".

So, perhaps this approach is still incorrect.

I must be missing something.

Let me consider that each user's view imposes a partial order on the users excluding themselves.

So, for user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], it imposes A before B, B before C, etc., in the actual order.

Similarly, for user Y's view [Y, D, E, F, ...], it imposes D before E, E before F, etc., in the actual order.

Then, I need to merge these partial orders into a single total order.

This is exactly what topological sorting does.

But in the example, according to this approach, there's a cycle, but the answer is "YES".

Hence, perhaps the answer is "YES" only if there exists a topological order that is consistent with all the partial orders.

Wait, perhaps I need to be more careful in constructing the graph.

Let me consider that for user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], the actual order is [A, B, C, ...], with X at the front.

So, in terms of edges, I should add A -> B, B -> C, etc., but not X -> A.

Because X is moved to the front, but the relative order of A, B, C, etc., remains the same as in the actual order.

Hence, for each user's view, I should add edges between the elements excluding the user themselves, in the order they appear.

So, for user X's view [X, A, B, C, ...], add A -> B -> C -> ...

Similarly, for user Y's view [Y, D, E, F, ...], add D -> E -> F -> ...

Then, check if these edges form a DAG with a topological order.

Let me try this with the example:

User 1: [1,2,3,4] => add 2 -> 3 -> 4

User 2: [2,3,1,4] => add 3 -> 1 -> 4

User 3: [3,2,1,4] => add 2 -> 1 -> 4

User 4: [4,2,3,1] => add 2 -> 3 -> 1

So, the edges are:

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

1 -> 4

2 -> 1

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

Combining duplicates:

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

1 -> 4

2 -> 1

This has a cycle: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2

Hence, "NO", but the example output is "YES".

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to exclude edges that are implied by transitivity.

For example, if 2 -> 3 and 3 -> 1, then 2 -> 1 is implied.

Hence, perhaps I should only add direct edges from each user's
