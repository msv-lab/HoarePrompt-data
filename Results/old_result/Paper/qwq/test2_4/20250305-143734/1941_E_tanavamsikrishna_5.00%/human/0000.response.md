Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. Bernard has to cross a river on a ferry, but he's always late. Rudolf wants to help by building bridges across the river to make the crossing faster. The river is represented as a grid with n rows and m columns, where each cell has a depth value a_{i,j}. The depths on the first and last columns are always 0 because those are the banks.

Rudolf can build bridges on consecutive rows, specifically k bridges on k consecutive rows. For each bridge on a row, he needs to install supports at certain columns to ensure the bridge is stable. The supports must be placed at the first and last columns (columns 1 and m), and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d. The cost of installing a support at cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.

The task is to choose which k consecutive rows to build bridges on, and for each row, decide where to place the supports to minimize the total cost of support installation across all k bridges.

First, I need to understand how to minimize the cost for a single row. Given a row, I need to place supports at column 1 and column m, and possibly at some columns in between, such that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart. The goal is to minimize the sum of (a_{i,j} + 1) for all supports placed.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem. I need to find a way to place supports optimally across the row, considering the constraints on the distances between supports.

Let me think about how to model this for a single row.

Let's define dp[j] as the minimum cost to place supports from column 1 to column j, inclusive, following the rules.

Base case:

dp[1] = a_{i,1} + 1, since we must place a support at column 1.

For j from 2 to m:

We must place a support at column j if it's the last column, and possibly at some columns before j, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most d.

So, for each j, I need to consider all possible positions for the last support before j, such that the distance between that support and j is at most d.

Wait, but in this problem, the supports must be placed at column 1 and column m, and any supports in between must be placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most d.

So, for a single row, I need to place supports at column 1 and column m, and possibly at some columns in between to ensure that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart.

The cost for each support is a_{i,j} + 1.

I need to minimize the total cost.

This seems similar to covering the row with supports where each support covers up to d columns to its left and right.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as finding a way to cover the row from column 1 to column m, placing supports such that each support is within d columns of the next support, and including the mandatory supports at column 1 and column m.

But dynamic programming seems like a good approach.

Let me try to define dp[j] as the minimum cost to place supports from column 1 to column j.

Base case:

dp[1] = a_{i,1} + 1

For j from 2 to m:

dp[j] = min over all possible last support positions before j, such that the distance to j is at most d.

Wait, but we have to place a support at column m, so dp[m] will be the total cost for the row.

But we also have to place supports at column 1, and possibly at some columns in between.

Wait, perhaps I should think of dp[j] as the minimum cost to place supports up to and including column j, with the last support being at column j.

Then, for j from 2 to m:

dp[j] = min over all possible last support positions t, where t is between max(1, j - d) and j - 1, of dp[t] + a_{i,j} + 1

But we must ensure that supports are placed at both column 1 and column m.

Wait, but column 1 is always included, so dp[1] = a_{i,1} + 1

Then, for j from 2 to m:

dp[j] = min over t from max(1, j - d) to j - 1 of dp[t] + a_{i,j} + 1

But we must ensure that column m has a support, so dp[m] will include the cost of placing a support at column m.

Wait, but in the above formulation, dp[m] will include the cost of placing a support at column m, plus the minimum cost to reach column t, where t is from max(1, m - d) to m - 1.

But since m can be up to 2*10^5, and n up to 100, this seems computationally feasible.

Wait, but m can be up to 2*10^5, and n up to 100, and t up to 10^3, but overall, with n*m up to 2*10^5, it should be manageable.

But in the code provided, there's a function func_1 that seems to implement this dp for a single row.

Let me look at func_1:

def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

return row[-1]

Wait, this seems similar to the dp approach I was thinking about.

In this function, it's iterating through the row and updating each position based on the minimum value from the previous d positions.

But let's see:

First loop: for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

This seems to be handling the initial part of the row, adding 1 to each of the first d-1 positions.

Then, for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

This seems to be setting row[i] to the minimum of the previous d elements plus row[i] + 1.

Wait, but in dp terms, it's considering the previous d positions to find the minimum cost to reach position i.

But in my earlier dp definition, I had dp[j] = min over t from max(1, j - d) to j - 1 of dp[t] + a_{i,j} + 1

So, this seems aligned.

But I need to ensure that supports are placed at both column 1 and column m.

In this implementation, it starts by adding 1 to the first d-1 positions, and then for each position from d-1 to the end, it takes the minimum of the previous d elements, adds row[i] + 1, and sets it as the new value for row[i].

Wait, but in dp terms, it's considering that each position can be reached from any of the previous d positions.

But in the problem, the distance between supports is at most d, meaning that the gap between two supports is at most d-1 columns.

Wait, the distance between two adjacent supports is at most d, meaning that if I have a support at position t, the next support can be at position t + d at most.

So, in dp terms, from position t, I can jump to positions between t + 1 to t + d.

But in the code, it's looking back d positions to find the minimum.

This seems like it might not correctly capture the intended constraint.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink the dp.

Let me consider a standard way to model this.

In the standard way to model steps or jumps where each step can cover up to d positions, the dp transition would be:

dp[j] = min(dp[t] + cost[j]) for t from j - d to j - 1

This ensures that to reach position j, we jump from some position t within d positions before j.

In this problem, the "jump" corresponds to placing a support at position t and then placing another support at position j, with the distance between them being at most d.

But there's a mandatory support at column 1 and at column m.

So, perhaps this dp formulation is adequate.

But looking back at the code:

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

return row[-1]

I think there might be an off-by-one error here.

In the first loop, it's adding 1 to the first d-1 positions.

But in the problem, supports must be placed at column 1 and column m, and the cost for each support is a_{i,j} + 1.

So, for column 1, the cost is a_{i,1} + 1, which is correctly set in the first loop.

Then, for other columns, it's considering the minimum of the previous d positions plus the cost of placing a support at j, which is a_{i,j} + 1.

But I'm not entirely sure if this captures the constraint correctly.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case:

n=3, m=11, k=1, d=4

Rows:

0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0

0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0

We need to choose one consecutive row (since k=1) and build a bridge on it, minimizing the total support cost.

According to the code, for each row, it computes the minimum cost using func_1, then selects the minimum among the three rows.

In the first row: 0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0

Applying func_1 with d=4.

First, for i=0 to d-2 (i=0 to 2):

row[0] = 0 + 1 = 1

row[1] = 1 + 1 = 2

row[2] = 2 + 1 = 3

Then, for i=3 to 10:

row[3] = min(row[3 - 5 : 3]) = min(row[-2:3]) which is min(row[0:3]) = min(1,2,3) =1 + row[3] +1 =1 +3 +1=5

row[4] = min(row[4 -5:4]) = min(row[-1:4]) = min(1,2,3,5)=1 +4 +1=6

row[5] = min(row[5-5:5])=min(row[0:5])=1 +5 +1=7

row[6] = min(row[1:6])=1 +4 +1=6

row[7] = min(row[2:7])=1 +3 +1=5

row[8] = min(row[3:8])=1 +2 +1=4

row[9] = min(row[4:9])=1 +1 +1=3

row[10]= min(row[5:10])=1 +0 +1=2

So, the final dp array would be:

1,2,3,5,6,7,6,5,4,3,2

So, the total cost for the first row is 2.

Similarly, for the second row:

0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

Applying func_1:

row[0]=1

row[1]=2

row[2]=3

row[3]= min(row[-2:3])=min(1,2,3)=1 +3 +1=5

row[4]= min(row[-1:4])=min(1,2,3,5)=1 +2 +1=4

row[5]= min(row[0:5])=1 +1 +1=3

row[6]= min(row[1:6])=1 +2 +1=4

row[7]= min(row[2:7])=1 +3 +1=5

row[8]= min(row[3:8])=1 +2 +1=4

row[9]= min(row[4:9])=1 +2 +1=4

row[10]= min(row[5:10])=1 +0 +1=2

So, dp array:1,2,3,5,4,3,4,5,4,4,2

Total cost for second row:2

Third row:

0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0

row[0]=1

row[1]=2

row[2]=3

row[3]= min(row[-2:3])=min(1,2,3)+3+1=7

row[4]= min(row[-1:4])=min(1,2,3,7)=1+5+1=7

row[5]= min(row[0:5])=1+5+1=7

row[6]= min(row[1:6])=1+5+1=7

row[7]= min(row[2:7])=1+5+1=7

row[8]= min(row[3:8])=1+5+1=7

row[9]= min(row[4:9])=1+5+1=7

row[10]= min(row[5:10])=1+0+1=2

dp array:1,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2

Total cost for third row:2

So, among the three rows, all have a total cost of 2, so the minimum is 2.

But in the sample input, the first test case output is 4.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, no, looking back at the sample output, the first test case output is 4.

So, according to my calculation, it's 2, but sample output is 4.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the dp formulation is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I need to ensure that supports are placed at column 1 and column m, and that between any two supports, the distance does not exceed d.

So, for a row, I need to place supports at column 1 and m, and possibly at some columns in between such that no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart.

The cost is sum of (a_{i,j} +1) for all supports placed.

So, for the first row:0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0

If I place supports at column 1 and 11, the distance between them is 9, which is more than d=4.

So, I need to place additional supports in between.

Possible placement: column 1, 5, 9, 11.

Distance between 1 and 5 is 4, between 5 and 9 is 4, between 9 and 11 is 2.

So, supports at 1,5,9,11.

Cost: (0+1) + (4+1) + (2+1) + (0+1) =1+5+3+1=10

But according to the code, it's giving 2, which is less than the sample output of 4, but the sample output is 4.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, k=1, but in the sample explanation, it's building a bridge on the second row, which has a cost of 4.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

5

3 11 1 4

0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0

0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0

4 4 2 1

0 3 3 0

0 2 1 0

0 1 2 0

0 3 3 0

4 5 2 5

0 1 1 1 0

0 2 2 2 0

0 2 1 1 0

0 3 2 1 0

1 8 1 1

0 10 4 8 4 4 2 0

4 5 3 2

0 8 4 4 0

0 3 4 8 0

0 8 1 10 0

0 10 1 5 0

Output:

4

8

4

15

14

So, for the first test case, with n=3, m=11, k=1, d=4, the output is 4.

But according to the code, it's computing func_1 for each row and taking the minimum.

In my earlier calculation, for the first row, I got 2, but according to the sample output, it's 4.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied func_1.

Let me look again at func_1:

def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

return row[-1]

So, for the first row: [0,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,0]

After first loop:

row[0]=1

row[1]=2

row[2]=3

row[3:]= unchanged for now

Then, for i=3 to 10:

row[3]= min(row[max(0,3-6):3])=min(row[-3:3])=min(row[0:3])=min(1,2,3)=1 +4 +1=6

row[4]= min(row[4-6:4])=min(row[-2:4])=min(1,2,3,6)=1 +5 +1=7

row[5]= min(row[5-6:5])=min(row[-1:5])=min(1,2,3,6,7)=1 +5 +1=7

row[6]= min(row[6-6:6])=min(row[0:6])=1 +4 +1=6

row[7]= min(row[7-6:7])=min(row[1:7])=1 +3 +1=5

row[8]= min(row[8-6:8])=min(row[2:8])=1 +2 +1=4

row[9]= min(row[9-6:9])=min(row[3:9])=1 +1 +1=3

row[10]=min(row[10-6:10])=min(row[4:10])=1 +0 +1=2

So, row[-1]=2

Similarly, for the second row: [0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,3,2,0]

After first loop:

row[0]=1

row[1]=2

row[2]=3

Then, for i=3 to 10:

row[3]= min(row[-2:3])=min(1,2,3)=1 +3 +1=5

row[4]= min(row[-1:4])=min(1,2,3,5)=1 +2 +1=4

row[5]= min(row[0:5])=1 +1 +1=3

row[6]= min(row[1:6])=1 +2 +1=4

row[7]= min(row[2:7])=1 +3 +1=5

row[8]= min(row[3:8])=1 +2 +1=4

row[9]= min(row[4:9])=1 +2 +1=4

row[10]=min(row[5:10])=1 +0 +1=2

So, row[-1]=2

Third row: [0,1,2,3,5,5,5,5,5,2,0]

After first loop:

row[0]=1

row[1]=2

row[2]=3

Then, for i=3 to 10:

row[3]= min(row[-2:3])=min(1,2,3)=1 +5 +1=7

row[4]= min(row[-1:4])=min(1,2,3,7)=1 +5 +1=7

row[5]= min(row[0:5])=1 +5 +1=7

row[6]= min(row[1:6])=1 +5 +1=7

row[7]= min(row[2:7])=1 +5 +1=7

row[8]= min(row[3:8])=1 +5 +1=7

row[9]= min(row[4:9])=1 +5 +1=7

row[10]=min(row[5:10])=1 +0 +1=2

So, row[-1]=2

Thus, for all three rows, the computed cost is 2, but the sample output is 4.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Looking back at the problem statement:

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), …, (i,m) and build a bridge over it.

In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge.

The cost of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1.

Supports must be installed so that:

1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1);

2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m);

3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d.

The distance between supports (i, j1) and (i, j2) is |j1 - j2| - 1.

So, the distance is |j1 - j2| -1, meaning that if two supports are in adjacent columns, the distance is 0.

Wait, for example, supports at j=1 and j=2 have distance 1 -2 -1 =0.

Wait, no, |j1 - j2| -1.

So, if j1=1, j2=2, distance is |1-2| -1 =1-1=0.

If j1=1, j2=3, distance=2-1=1.

If j1=1, j2=5, distance=4.

So, the distance between supports is |j1 - j2| -1, which must be <=d.

Wait, but in the code, it's using a dp where it looks back d positions, which corresponds to looking back columns that are within d columns.

But according to the distance definition, |j1 - j2| -1 <=d, meaning that |j1 - j2| <=d+1.

So, the actual constraint is that supports must be at most d+1 columns apart.

Wait, distance = |j1 - j2| -1 <=d => |j1 - j2| <=d+1

So, the supports must be at most d+1 columns apart.

But in the code, func_1 is looking back d positions, which might not align with the actual constraint of supports being at most d+1 columns apart.

Wait, in the dp transition, if we set t from j - (d+1) to j -1, then the distance between t and j is |t -j| -1 = (j - t) -1 <=d

Since j - t -1 <=d => j - t <=d+1 => t >= j - (d+1)

So, to ensure that the distance between t and j is <=d, we need t >= j - (d+1)

Hence, in the dp transition, we should be looking back up to d+1 positions.

But in the code, it's looking back d positions: i - (d +1):i

Wait, in the code, it's row[i - (d +1):i], which is correct, as it looks back up to d+1 positions.

But in the earlier calculation, I think there was a mistake.

Let me recalculate for the first row with d=4.

So, distance between supports <=4, meaning |j1 - j2| -1 <=4 => |j1 - j2| <=5

So, supports must be at most 5 columns apart.

In the dp transition, for j from d-1 to len(row), row[i] = min(row[i - (d+1):i]) + row[i] +1

Wait, but d=4, so d+1=5.

So, for j from 3 to 10:

row[3]= min(row[max(0,3-5):3])=min(row[-2:3])=min(row[0:3])=1 +4 +1=6

row[4]= min(row[4-5:4])=min(row[-1:4])=min(row[0:4])=1 +5 +1=7

row[5]= min(row[5-5:5])=min(row[0:5])=1 +5 +1=7

row[6]= min(row[6-5:6])=min(row[1:6])=1 +4 +1=6

row[7]= min(row[7-5:7])=min(row[2:7])=1 +3 +1=5

row[8]= min(row[8-5:8])=min(row[3:8])=1 +2 +1=4

row[9]= min(row[9-5:9])=min(row[4:9])=1 +1 +1=3

row[10]=min(row[10-5:10])=min(row[5:10])=1 +0 +1=2

So, dp array:1,2,3,6,7,7,6,5,4,3,2

Hence, the total cost is 2.

But according to the sample output, it's 4.

Wait, perhaps the dp is incorrect.

Let me think about what's wrong.

In the dp approach, dp[j] represents the minimum cost to reach column j with a support at j.

But in reality, for the first row, placing supports only at columns 1 and 11 is invalid because the distance between them is 10 -1=9, which is greater than d=4.

Hence, additional supports are needed in between.

But according to the dp calculation, it's giving a cost of 2, which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the dp is not correctly capturing the requirement to place supports such that no two adjacent supports are more than d apart.

In the dp transition, dp[j] = min(dp[t]) for t in [j - (d+1), j-1)] + a[j] +1

This ensures that the distance between t and j is at most d.

But in the calculation above, for the first row, dp[10]= min(row[5:10])=1 +0 +1=2

But this doesn't account for the fact that supports need to be placed at columns where a support is actually placed.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that supports are placed at column 1 and column m, and possibly at some columns in between, but the dp as implemented doesn't enforce that supports are placed at all necessary positions.

Wait, maybe the dp is summing up the costs incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the dp[j] should include the cost of placing a support at j, and the minimum cost to reach j from previous positions within d distance.

In that case, for the first row:

dp[1]=1

dp[2]=2

dp[3]=3

dp[4]= min(dp[4-5:4])=dp[0 to 4]=1 +4 +1=6

dp[5]= min(dp[5-5:5])=dp[0 to 5]=1 +5 +1=7

dp[6]= min(dp[1 to 6])=1 +4 +1=6

dp[7]= min(dp[2 to 7])=1 +3 +1=5

dp[8]= min(dp[3 to 8])=1 +2 +1=4

dp[9]= min(dp[4 to 9])=1 +1 +1=3

dp[10]= min(dp[5 to 10])=1 +0 +1=2

But according to this, dp[10]=2, but that doesn't make sense because we need to place supports at columns 1 and 11, and possibly at other columns.

Wait, perhaps the dp[j] should represent the total cost to build the bridge up to column j, with a support at j.

In that case, dp[m] would be the total cost for the row.

But in the first row, dp[10]=2, which is less than the sample output of 4.

This suggests that the dp is not correctly capturing the necessary supports.

Wait, perhaps the dp is double-counting or missing some support placements.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I model this as selecting a subset of columns to place supports, including columns 1 and m, such that any two adjacent supports are at most d+1 columns apart.

Then, the total cost is sum of (a_{i,j} +1) for all selected j.

I need to select a subset of columns that covers the entire row with supports no more than d+1 columns apart.

This sounds like a classic interval covering problem.

In this case, for each row, I can find the minimum cost to cover the row with supports placed according to the distance constraint.

I can use dp to achieve this.

Let me try to redefine dp[j] as the minimum cost to cover columns from 1 to j.

Then, dp[j] = min(dp[t] + cost of placing a support at j), for t in [j - d -1, j -1]

Wait, but in the code, it's using dp[j] = min(dp[t] for t in [j - d -1, j -1]) + a[j] +1

But in the first row, dp[10]=2, which is less than the sample output of 4.

This suggests that the dp is not correctly capturing the necessary supports.

Wait, perhaps the dp needs to ensure that supports are placed at column 1 and column m, and that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most d.

In the dp transition, dp[j] = min(dp[t] for t in [j - d -1, j -1]) + a[j] +1

But in reality, for the first row, to cover from column 1 to 11 with d=4, meaning supports can cover up to 5 columns apart.

So, supports need to be placed at columns where the distance to the next support is at most d.

In the first row, placing supports at columns 1,5,9,11.

Cost: (0+1) + (4+1) + (2+1) + (0+1) =1+5+3+1=10

But according to the dp, dp[10]=2, which is less than 10, so clearly something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the dp is incorrectly calculating the minimal cost.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the dp to ensure that supports are placed appropriately.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I iterate through the row and place supports greedily.

Start at column 1.

Place a support at column 1.

Then, the next support can be placed up to column 1 + d +1 =1 +5=6.

So, place a support at column 6.

Then, from column 6, the next support can be placed up to column 6 +5=11.

So, place a support at column 11.

So, supports at 1,6,11.

Cost: (0+1) + (5+1) + (0+1)=1+6+1=8

But according to the sample output, it's 4.

Wait, but 8 is still higher than 4.

Wait, perhaps there's a better placement.

If I place supports at 1,5,9,11, cost is 10, which is worse.

Wait, maybe placing at 1,5,11, distance between 5 and 11 is 6, which is greater than d=4.

Wait, no, distance is |11-5|-1=5, which is greater than d=4.

So, that's invalid.

Hence, supports must be placed at least at 1,6,11.

Cost:1+6+1=8

But sample output is 4, which is less than 8.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the understanding.

Wait, perhaps the distance is defined differently.

Wait, the distance between supports (i,j1) and (i,j2) is |j1 - j2| -1 <=d.

So, for supports at 1 and 6, distance is |6-1|-1=5-1=4, which is equal to d=4.

Similarly, supports at 6 and 11, distance is |11-6|-1=5-1=4.

So, supports at 1,6,11 are valid.

Total cost:1 +6 +1=8

But sample output is 4, which is less than 8.

Wait, perhaps in the second row, there's a better placement.

Looking at the second row:0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

If I place supports at 1,5,9,11:

Cost: (0+1)+(2+1)+(2+1)+(0+1)=1+3+3+1=8

Alternatively, placing at 1,6,11:

Cost:1 + (1+1) +1=1+2+1=4

Distance between 1 and 6 is 5-1=4<=4

Distance between 6 and 11 is 5<=4, which is equal to d=4.

So, total cost is 4.

This matches the sample output.

Hence, for the second row, the minimal cost is 4.

But according to the dp calculation earlier, dp[10]=2, which is less than 4.

This suggests that the dp is incorrectly calculating the cost.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**
