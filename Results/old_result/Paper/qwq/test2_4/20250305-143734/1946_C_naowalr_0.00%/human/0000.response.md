Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about trees in graph theory, which I've worked with before, but I need to be careful because trees can be tricky sometimes.

So, the problem is: Given a tree with n vertices, I need to find the maximum number x such that I can remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that every remaining connected component has at least x vertices.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. I have a tree, which is an undirected graph with no cycles and n-1 edges. I need to remove exactly k edges, not more, not less. After removing these k edges, the tree will split into k+1 connected components because each time you remove an edge from a tree, you increase the number of connected components by one.

So, if I remove k edges, I'll have k+1 connected components. Now, I need each of these components to have at least x vertices, and I need to maximize x.

This sounds like a binary search problem. I can binary search on the value of x and check for each x whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, I need a way to check, for a given x, whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To do this, I can perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree and keep track of the sizes of the subtrees.

Here's an idea: Start from a root (let's say vertex 1), and perform a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree.

Then, decide which edges to remove based on the subtree sizes.

I need to remove edges in such a way that the resulting components have at least x vertices.

Wait, but since it's a tree, removing an edge will separate the tree into two components: one containing the root and the other containing the subtree below the removed edge.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each time I remove an edge, I'm splitting the tree into two components. I need to ensure that both components have at least x vertices.

But actually, after removing k edges, there will be k+1 components, and all of them must have at least x vertices.

I need to maximize x, so I need to find the largest possible x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges and all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This sounds like I need to find a way to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

Wait, but I need to remove exactly k edges, which will create k+1 components.

So, I need to choose k edges to remove such that all k+1 resulting components have at least x vertices.

To maximize x, I need to minimize the sizes of the components, but since I need to maximize x, I need to find the largest x such that it's possible to have all components of size at least x.

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to formalize it.

Let's consider that after removing k edges, there are k+1 components. I need each of these components to have at least x vertices.

To maximize x, I need to find the largest x such that there exists a way to remove exactly k edges resulting in all components having at least x vertices.

This sounds like a binary search on x, where for each x, I check if I can remove exactly k edges to satisfy the condition.

So, I'll perform a binary search on x from 1 to n.

For each x, I need to check:

- Can I remove exactly k edges such that all resulting k+1 components have at least x vertices?

This check needs to be efficient because n can be up to 10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, so I need an efficient way to perform this check.

Let me think about how to implement this check.

I can perform a DFS on the tree and try to find the number of components that would have at least x vertices if I remove certain edges.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of counting the number of edges I need to remove to ensure that no component has fewer than x vertices.

But I need to remove exactly k edges.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

In the solution, there's a function `func_1()` that reads the input and iterates over multiple test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and k, then reads the tree edges to construct the adjacency list.

Then, it sets L = 1 and R = 100001 (which is more than the maximum n, so it covers all possible n).

It performs a binary search between L and R.

In each step of the binary search, it sets x = (L + R) // 2, then calls dfs(1, 1) to calculate the number of cuts needed.

If the number of cuts is greater than k, or if the number of cuts equals k and the leftover vertices are greater than or equal to x, it sets L = x.

Otherwise, it sets R = x.

Finally, it prints L.

This seems to be performing a binary search on x to find the maximum x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges and have all components with at least x vertices.

Now, looking at the dfs function:

`dfs(a, p)`

This is a recursive DFS function that calculates the size of the subtree rooted at a, with parent p.

It sums up the sizes of all subtrees plus 1 for the current vertex.

Then, if the total vertices in the subtree (including a) are greater than or equal to x and a is not the root (a != p), it increments numCuts and returns 0, indicating that this subtree is separated into a component.

Otherwise, it returns the total vertices in the subtree.

So, the idea is:

- Perform DFS to calculate subtree sizes.

- For a given x, count how many edges need to be removed to separate components where each has at least x vertices.

- If the number of cuts equals k and the remaining component also has at least x vertices, then this x is achievable.

- Adjust the binary search range based on this.

This seems correct at first glance.

Let me think about some examples.

Take the first example in the problem:

n = 5, k = 1

Tree edges:

1-2

1-3

3-4

3-5

So, the tree looks like:

1

| \

2 3 - 4

|

5

If I remove the edge between 1 and 3, I get two components:

- 1-2 (size 2)

- 3-4-5 (size 3)

Both have at least x=2.

If I try x=3, I need both components to have at least 3 vertices.

But 1-2 has only 2 vertices, which is less than 3.

So, x=3 is not achievable.

Hence, the answer is 2.

In the solution, the binary search would check x=2 and x=3, and correctly determine that x=2 is achievable but x=3 is not.

Another example:

n=2, k=1

Only one edge: 1-2

If I remove the only edge, I have two components: [1] and [2], both with size 1.

So, for x=1, it's achievable.

But the output should be 1.

Wait, but k=1, and n=2.

In the sample input, for n=2, k=1, the output is 1.

So, the solution seems correct.

Another example:

n=6, k=1

Tree edges:

1-2

2-3

3-4

4-5

5-6

A straight line: 1-2-3-4-5-6

If I remove edge 2-3, I get two components: [1-2] and [3-4-5-6], sizes 2 and 4.

So, for x=2, it's achievable.

But the sample input for this case outputs 3.

Wait, no, in the sample input, for n=6, k=1, the output is 3.

Wait, but in my example, removing edge 2-3 gives components of size 2 and 4, but x=3 is not satisfied because one component has size 2 < 3.

So, maybe there's a better way to remove the edge.

If I remove edge 4-5, I get components [1-2-3-4] and [5-6], sizes 4 and 2.

Again, x=3 is not achievable.

But according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize x such that after removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

So, maybe there's a way to remove one edge to get components with at least 3 vertices.

Wait, in the straight line, removing any edge results in one component with 2 vertices, which is less than 3.

So, why is the sample output 3?

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input and output.

Looking back at the sample input:

6

5 1

1 2

1 3

3 4

3 5

2 1

1 2

6 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5 6

3 1

1 2

1 3

8 2

1 2

1 3

2 4

2 5

3 6

3 7

3 8

6 2

1 2

2 3

1 4

4 5

5 6

And the output is:

2

1

3

1

1

2

Wait, for n=6, k=1, output is 3.

But in my earlier example, for n=6, k=1 in a straight line, it's not possible to have x=3.

Wait, maybe the tree is not a straight line.

Looking back at the input:

6 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5 6

Yes, it's a straight line.

But according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, maybe I need to consider a different way of removing edges.

Wait, perhaps the tree is not a straight line.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=6, k=1, the tree is:

1-2-3-4-5-6

If I remove edge 2-3, I get [1-2] and [3-4-5-6], sizes 2 and 4.

If I remove edge 3-4, I get [1-2-3] and [4-5-6], sizes 3 and 3.

Ah, there it is.

So, by removing edge 3-4, I get two components, each with 3 vertices, which satisfies x=3.

So, x=3 is achievable.

That makes sense.

So, in this case, x=3 is possible by choosing to remove the edge between 3 and 4.

Good, I see.

So, the solution seems correct.

Another test case:

n=3, k=1

Tree edges:

1-2

1-3

If I remove edge 1-2, I get components [1-3] and [2], sizes 2 and 1.

Similarly, removing 1-3 gives [1-2] and [3], sizes 2 and 1.

So, for x=1, it's achievable, but for x=2, only one component has size >=2, but the other has size 1, which is less than 2.

Hence, x=1 is the maximum achievable x.

Which matches the sample output of 1 for this case.

Another test case:

n=8, k=2

Tree edges:

1-2

1-3

2-4

2-5

3-6

3-7

3-8

So, the tree looks like:

1

| \

2 3

| \ | | |

4 5 6 7 8

If I remove edges 1-2 and 1-3, I get three components: [1], [2-4-5], [3-6-7-8], sizes 1, 3, 4.

Which doesn't satisfy x>=1, but x=1 is achievable.

But according to the sample output, for this case, it's 1.

But the problem is to maximize x such that after removing exactly k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

In this case, if I remove edges 1-2 and 1-3, I get three components: [1], [2-4-5], [3-6-7-8], with sizes 1, 3, 4.

Which doesn't satisfy x>=2 because one component has size 1.

Hence, x=1 is the maximum achievable x.

Another test case:

n=6, k=2

Tree edges:

1-2

2-3

1-4

4-5

5-6

Which looks like:

1

| \

2 4

| \ |

3 5 6

If I remove edges 1-2 and 1-4, I get three components: [1], [2-3], [4-5-6], sizes 1, 2, 3.

Which only satisfies x=1.

If I remove edges 2-3 and 4-5, I get components: [1-2], [3], [4], [5-6], sizes 2,1,1,2.

Which doesn't satisfy x>=1 because some components have size 1.

Wait, but I need to remove exactly 2 edges.

It seems that in this case, no matter which two edges I remove, there will be at least one component with size 1.

Hence, x=1 is the maximum achievable x.

Which matches the sample output of 1 for this case.

So, the solution seems correct based on these test cases.

Now, looking back at the reference solution, it implements a binary search on x, and for each x, it performs a DFS to count the number of cuts needed.

In the DFS, for each subtree, if its size is >= x, it's separated into a component, and the cut is counted.

Finally, it checks if the number of cuts equals k and the remaining component has at least x vertices.

This seems correct because it's essentially trying to partition the tree into components where each has at least x vertices, and counting the number of cuts needed to achieve that.

If the number of cuts needed is equal to k and the remaining component also has at least x vertices, then x is achievable.

Otherwise, it adjusts the binary search range accordingly.

This should work correctly.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}
