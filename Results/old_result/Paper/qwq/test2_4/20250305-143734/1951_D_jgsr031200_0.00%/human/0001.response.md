Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls with prices such that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES" along with the number of stalls and their prices. If not, I should output "NO".

First, I need to think about how Alice's buying behavior works. She spends her coins on each stall in sequence, buying as many jewels as possible at each stall before moving to the next one. So, the order of the stalls matters because she spends her coins step by step.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1 from the problem:

n = 7, k = 3

One possible solution is to set up 10 stalls with prices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

At the first stall, Alice buys 7 // 2 = 3 jewels, spending 6 coins, and is left with 1 coin.

Since 1 coin is not enough to buy any jewels from the remaining stalls, she stops after buying 3 jewels.

This matches the desired k = 3.

Another example from the problem:

n = 255, k = 8

Stalls with prices: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

Alice buys:

- 1 jewel from the first stall: 128 coins, left with 127

- 1 from the second: 64 coins, left with 63

- 1 from the third: 32 coins, left with 31

- 1 from the fourth: 16 coins, left with 15

- 1 from the fifth: 8 coins, left with 7

- 1 from the sixth: 4 coins, left with 3

- 1 from the seventh: 2 coins, left with 1

- 1 from the eighth: 1 coin, left with 0

Total jewels bought: 8, which is exactly k.

But in the second test case:

n = 6, k = 4

The output is "NO", meaning it's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels.

From these examples, I need to find a general approach to determine whether it's possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy.

- Minimal k: If Bob sets up only one stall with price p = n // k + 1 (or something), Alice would buy fewer jewels.

Wait, no. If Bob sets up one stall with p = n // k + 1, then the number of jewels Alice buys is n // p, which might be less than k.

Actually, with one stall, the number of jewels bought is n // p, which is at most n (when p = 1).

But we need exactly k.

So, with one stall, it's only possible if n // p = k, which implies p = n // k.

But p must divide n exactly to get k jewels, which might not always be possible.

Hence, with one stall, it's limited.

With two stalls, perhaps Bob can adjust the prices to make Alice buy a specific number of jewels in total.

Let me consider the function of how many jewels are bought at each stall.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels at the first stall and spends floor(n / p1) * p1 coins.

Then, she has n - floor(n / p1) * p1 coins left.

At the second stall, she buys floor(remaining / p2) jewels, spends floor(remaining / p2) * p2 coins, and so on.

The total jewels bought is sum over all stalls of floor(remaining_coins / p_i).

The challenge is to choose s <= 60 and p1, p2, ..., ps such that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

This seems tricky because the remaining coins after each stall affect how many jewels can be bought at the next stall.

I need to find a way to control the number of jewels bought at each stall to reach exactly k.

One idea is to set up stalls with decreasing prices, like in the second example, where prices are powers of 2.

In that case, Alice buys one jewel from each stall until her coins run out.

But in the first example, with prices 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, she buys 3 jewels from the first stall and stops.

So, different pricing strategies lead to different buying behaviors.

Let me think about necessary conditions for it to be possible.

First, k cannot be greater than n, because even if all jewels cost 1 coin, Alice can buy at most n jewels.

Wait, no. If p = 1, Alice can buy floor(n / 1) = n jewels.

But in the problem, k can be up to 10^18, and n can be up to 10^18, so that's fine.

Actually, if p = 1, Alice can buy n jewels.

If p = 2, she can buy floor(n / 2) jewels.

And so on.

So, with one stall, k can be floor(n / p), for some p.

But we can have up to 60 stalls, which allows more flexibility.

Another thing to consider is that if k = n, then setting p = 1, Alice buys n jewels.

If k = 1, Alice can buy one jewel from a stall with p = n, spending n coins.

If k = 0, but k cannot be 0 as per constraints, since k is at least 1.

Wait, no, k is at least 1 as per the problem.

So, for k = n, p = 1 is sufficient.

For k = 1, p = n is sufficient.

For other values, it's trickier.

Let me consider the case where n = 7, k = 3.

One solution is to set up 10 stalls with prices 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.

At the first stall, she buys 3 jewels (spending 6 coins), and is left with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy any jewels from the remaining stalls.

So, total jewels bought: 3.

Another possible setup: set up two stalls with p1 = 2, p2 = 1.

At the first stall, she buys floor(7 / 2) = 3 jewels, spending 6 coins, left with 1 coin.

At the second stall, she buys floor(1 / 1) = 1 jewel, spending 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels: 4, which is more than k=3.

So, in this case, it's not possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly k=3 jewels.

Wait, but in the first example, with 10 stalls, it's possible.

So, it depends on how the stalls are set up.

Hence, the pricing strategy is crucial.

Let me think about a general approach.

I need to find a way to partition the n coins into k jewels, considering the greedy buying behavior.

One way to think about it is to consider that Alice buys jewels in groups, where each group corresponds to a stall.

At each stall, she buys as many jewels as possible with the current coins, and then moves to the next stall.

So, I need to set up stalls in such a way that the total number of jewels bought across all stalls is exactly k.

This sounds similar to partitioning n into k parts, but with the constraint that the partitioning is done in a specific greedy manner.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls needed to achieve this.

In the first example, 10 stalls are used, but maybe fewer would suffice.

In the third example, 8 stalls are used, which corresponds to the binary representation of n.

Wait, in the third example, n=255, which is 2^8 -1, and k=8.

By setting up stalls with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

So, in this case, s=8 stalls are used.

But s can be up to 60, which is more than enough for most practical purposes.

Now, I need to find a general method to determine if it's possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start by setting up stalls with decreasing prices, similar to the binary representation.

- Calculate how many jewels Alice would buy at each stall.

- Sum up the jewels until the total reaches k.

- If the total equals k, output "YES" along with the stall prices.

- If it's not possible to reach exactly k, output "NO".

But in the second example, n=6 and k=4, it's "NO".

Let's see why.

If I set up stalls with prices 3 and 1:

- At stall 1 (p=3), Alice buys 2 jewels (spending 6 coins), left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than 4.

If I set up stalls with prices 2 and 1:

- At stall 1 (p=2), Alice buys 3 jewels (spending 6 coins), left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 3, still less than 4.

If I set up stalls with prices 1:

- At stall 1 (p=1), Alice buys 6 jewels (spending 6 coins), left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

So, in this case, it's impossible to get exactly 4 jewels.

Hence, "NO".

Another approach: try to maximize or minimize the number of jewels bought.

But I need to reach exactly k.

Let me consider that the minimal number of stalls needed is related to the number of times Alice can buy jewels.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a mathematical equation.

Let me denote:

Let p1, p2, ..., ps be the prices of the s stalls.

Let a_i = floor(n / p_i) be the number of jewels bought at stall i.

Then, the total jewels bought is sum_{i=1 to s} a_i.

But this is under the condition that after buying a_i jewels at stall i, the remaining coins are n - a_i * p_i, and this remaining amount is used for the next stall.

Wait, actually, it's not just sum a_i, because the remaining coins after each stall affect the next stall.

So, it's more involved.

Let me try to model it step by step.

Let remaining_coins = n.

Initialize total_jewels = 0.

For each stall from 1 to s:

a_i = floor(remaining_coins / p_i)

total_jewels += a_i

remaining_coins -= a_i * p_i

So, the final total_jewels should be equal to k.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that this total is exactly k.

This seems complicated to solve directly.

Maybe I can look for a way to minimize or maximize the total_jewels.

First, the minimal total_jewels is 0, by setting all p_i very large.

The maximal total_jewels is n, by setting all p_i =1.

I need to reach exactly k, where 1 <= k <= 10^18.

Given that s can be up to 60, which is small compared to k and n, perhaps there is a way to adjust the prices to reach any k between 1 and n.

But in the second example, it's not possible for k=4 with n=6.

So, there must be some constraints.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls needed to reach exactly k.

If k = n, set s=1, p1=1.

If k =1, set s=1, p1=n.

If k =0, not allowed, since k >=1.

Wait, k >=1 as per constraints.

Now, think about k > n.

Wait, no, k <= n, since Alice can't buy more jewels than the number of coins she has, assuming p_i >=1.

Wait, actually, if p_i =1, she can buy n jewels.

If p_i >1, she buys floor(n / p_i) jewels.

So, k <=n is possible.

Wait, but in the problem, it's allowed that k > n, but only if p_i <= floor(n / k).

Wait, no, p_i can be any value between 1 and 10^18.

But if p_i > n, then a_i =0.

So, effectively, k cannot be greater than n, because the maximum jewels Alice can buy is n (when p_i=1).

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says 1 <= n, k <=10^18.

But in reality, k cannot be greater than n, because with p_i=1, she can buy n jewels.

Hence, for k >n, it's impossible.

Wait, but in the problem, n and k can be up to 10^18, but there are cases where k >n.

Wait, no, in the problem, it's possible that k >n, but it's impossible to achieve.

Wait, no, with p_i=1, she can buy n jewels, and with p_i >1, she buys fewer jewels.

Hence, k cannot be greater than n.

Wait, but in the second example, n=6, k=4, which is k <n, but it's "NO".

So, there must be some other constraints.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

I need to have sum over i of floor(remaining_coins / p_i) = k.

This is difficult to handle directly.

An alternative approach is to consider the total coins spent and the number of jewels bought.

But since the prices are variable, it's tricky.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal number of jewels that can be bought with s stalls.

With s=1:

Minimal k: 0 (if p >n)

Maximal k: floor(n / p)

With s=2:

It's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can use induction on s.

But that might not be straightforward.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix the prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Then, the total jewels bought is determined by the algorithm.

But to find p1, p2, ..., ps such that the total is exactly k is not trivial.

Maybe I can think in terms of the remaining coins after each stall.

Let me denote r0 = n (initial coins)

After stall 1:

a1 = floor(r0 / p1)

r1 = r0 - a1 * p1

After stall 2:

a2 = floor(r1 / p2)

r2 = r1 - a2 * p2

...

After stall s:

as = floor(rs-1 / ps)

rs = rs-1 - as * ps

Total jewels: a1 + a2 + ... + as = k

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps and s <=60 such that this sum is k.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to find a strategy to set up the stalls.

One idea is to set up stalls with prices that correspond to the binary representation of n.

For example, in the third test case, n=255, which is 11111111 in binary.

Setting up stalls with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1 corresponds to the binary decomposition of n.

In this case, Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

This works when n is equal to 2^s -1 for some s.

But in general, for any n, using binary decomposition, Alice would buy one jewel from each stall, up to s stalls, where s is the number of bits in n.

But in the first example, n=7 (111 in binary), and k=3, which worked with 10 stalls, but actually, with s=3 stalls with prices 2,3,4, she buys 3 jewels from the first stall and stops.

Wait, but in the problem, they used 10 stalls with prices 2 through 11, and she buys 3 jewels from the first stall and stops.

So, it's possible with s=10.

But can it be done with fewer stalls?

Yes, with s=1, p=2, she buys 3 jewels.

With s=1, p=3, she buys 2 jewels.

With s=1, p=4, she buys 1 jewel.

With s=2, p1=2, p2=1:

- At p1=2, buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin.

- At p2=1, buys 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0.

- Total jewels: 4, which is more than k=3.

Not good.

With s=2, p1=3, p2=1:

- At p1=3, buys 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin.

- At p2=1, buys 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0.

- Total jewels: 3.

This matches k=3.

So, with s=2, p1=3, p2=1, it's possible.

But in the problem's example, they used s=10 with p1=2 to p10=11.

Both work, but s=2 is sufficient.

Hence, in this case, it's possible with s=2.

So, perhaps, for any n and k, where k <=n, it's possible to set up s <=60 stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But in the second example, n=6, k=4, it's "NO".

Wait, but according to this, maybe it's not always possible.

Hence, there must be some constraints.

Let me think about the relationship between n and k.

Suppose I set up s=1 stall with p1 = n // k.

Then, Alice buys floor(n / p1) = k jewels.

Wait, if p1 = n // k, then floor(n / p1) = k or more, depending on the division.

Wait, let's see:

Let p1 = n // k.

Then, floor(n / p1) = floor(n / (n // k)).

Now, n // k * k <= n < (n // k +1) * k.

Hence, floor(n / (n // k)) = ceil(n / (n // k)).

Wait, no.

Let me compute floor(n / floor(n / k)).

Let q = floor(n / k).

Then, floor(n / q) = ceil(n / q), but not necessarily.

Actually, floor(n / q) could be equal to k or k+1.

Wait, this is getting messy.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=7, k=3.

p1 = 7 // 3 = 2.

Then, floor(7 / 2) = 3, which is equal to k.

So, with s=1, p1=2, it's possible.

But in the second example, n=6, k=4.

p1 = 6 // 4 = 1.

Then, floor(6 / 1) = 6, which is more than k=4.

Hence, with s=1, p1=1, Alice buys 6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

Similarly, with s=2, p1=2, p2=1:

- At p1=2, buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0.

- At p2=1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Not good.

With s=2, p1=3, p2=1:

- At p1=3, buys 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0.

- At p2=1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than 4.

Still not good.

With s=2, p1=2, p2=2:

- At p1=2, buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0.

- At p2=2, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Not enough.

With s=2, p1=1, p2=1:

- At p1=1, buys 6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0.

- At p2=1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

Still not 4.

Hence, with s=2, it's not possible to get exactly k=4.

Similarly, with s=3, try p1=2, p2=2, p3=1:

- At p1=2, buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0.

- At p2=2, buys 0 jewels.

- At p3=1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 3.

Still less than 4.

With s=3, p1=2, p2=1, p3=1:

- At p1=2, buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0.

- At p2=1, buys 0 jewels.

- At p3=1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 3.

Same issue.

With s=4, p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, p4=1:

- Same as above, total jewels: 3.

Still not 4.

Hence, it seems impossible to get exactly k=4 with n=6, regardless of the number of stalls.

Hence, "NO" is the correct answer for that case.

So, the problem is to determine when it's possible to set up s <=60 stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

From the above analysis, it's not always possible, even if s <=60.

Hence, I need to find a general condition to determine when it's possible.

Let me consider that the minimal number of jewels Alice can buy is s, when each p_i =1, and she buys one jewel from each stall, totaling s jewels.

Wait, no.

If p_i =1, she buys floor(remaining_coins / 1) = remaining_coins jewels at each stall.

Hence, with s stalls with p_i=1, she buys min(n, s) jewels.

Wait, no.

Actually, at the first stall, she buys n jewels, spends n coins, and is left with 0 coins.

Hence, total jewels bought is n, regardless of s.

So, setting all p_i=1 doesn't help in reducing the total jewels below n.

Wait, unless s=1, p1=1, buys n jewels.

If s=2, p1=1, p2=1:

- At p1=1, buys n jewels, spends n coins, left with 0.

- At p2=1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: n.

So, same as s=1.

Hence, with p_i=1, total jewels is n.

If p_i >1, total jewels could be less than n.

Hence, to make total jewels equal to k, which is less than n, I need to set some p_i >1.

Let me consider that the total jewels bought is the sum of floor(remaining_coins / p_i) over all stalls.

I need this sum to be exactly k.

This seems difficult to control directly.

An alternative approach is to try to make the total jewels bought equal to k by carefully choosing p_i.

Let me consider that if I set p1 = n - (k-1), then at the first stall, Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels.

Let me compute floor(n / (n - (k-1))).

If p1 = n - (k-1), then floor(n / p1) = floor(n / (n - k +1)).

Let me see for n=7, k=3:

p1 = 7 - 2 =5.

floor(7/5)=1.

Then remaining coins: 7 -1*5=2.

At p2=1, buys floor(2/1)=2 jewels, spends 2 coins, left with 0.

Total jewels:1 +2=3.

Which matches k=3.

Similarly, for n=255, k=8:

Set p1=255-7=248.

floor(255/248)=1, spends 248, left with 7.

At p2=7-6=1.

Wait, no, p2=7 - (8-2)=6.

Wait, this seems messy.

Wait, perhaps not the right approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set p1 such that floor(n / p1) = a1, and then remaining coins are n - a1 * p1.

Then, set p2 such that floor((n - a1 * p1) / p2) = a2, and so on.

I need a1 + a2 + ... + as =k.

This seems too vague to find a general solution.

Let me consider that the minimal number of stalls required is ceil(k / floor(n / s)), or something like that.

Wait, I'm getting lost.

Let me look for an upper bound on s.

Given that s <=60, perhaps there is a way to set up s stalls to reach any k between 1 and n.

But in the second example, it's not possible for k=4 with n=6.

Hence, there must be some constraints based on n and k.

Let me consider that for some values of n and k, it's impossible to reach exactly k, even with s <=60.

Hence, I need to find a way to determine if it's possible or not.

Perhaps, it's only possible when k <= floor(n / p), for some p.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that with s=1, it's possible only if k = floor(n / p) for some p.

Which implies that k divides n, or something like that.

Wait, no.

Wait, if s=1, then p = n // k.

Then, floor(n / p) = k.

Wait, in the first example, n=7, k=3.

p =7//3=2.

floor(7/2)=3, which matches.

In the second example, n=6, k=4.

p=6//4=1.

floor(6/1)=6, which is more than k=4.

Hence, with s=1, it's not possible.

With s=2, as we saw earlier, it's still not possible to get exactly k=4.

Hence, "NO".

So, perhaps, for s=1, it's possible only if n // p =k, which implies p = n //k.

But floor(n / p) =k only if p = n //k and n % p >=0.

Wait, more precisely, p = n //k, and n % p < p.

But p = n //k.

Hence, floor(n / p) =k only if n % p < p.

Which is always true, since n % p < p by definition.

Wait, no.

n % p is less than p by definition.

Hence, floor(n / p) =k only if p = n //k.

Hence, with s=1, it's possible only if floor(n / p) =k, which requires p = n //k.

But in that case, floor(n / p) =k only if n - p *k < p.

Wait, n - p *k < p, which is n -k * p < p.

But p = n //k.

Hence, n -k * p < p.

Which simplifies to n < p*(k+1).

Given that p = n //k, we have n < (n //k)*(k+1).

This might or might not hold.

In the first example, n=7, k=3, p=2.

Check: 7 < 2*(4)=8, which holds.

Hence, floor(7/2)=3.

In the second example, n=6, k=4, p=1.

Check: 6 < 1*(5)=5, which is not true (6 <5 is false).

Hence, floor(6/1)=6, which is more than k=4.

Hence, with s=1, it's not possible.

Hence, in general, with s=1, it's possible only if k <=n and k >=1, and n -k*(n//k) < n//k.

Wait, n -k*floor(n/k) < floor(n/k).

Which simplifies to n < floor(n/k)*(k+1).

Which may or may not hold.

Hence, with s=1, it's possible only if k divides n or n -k*(n//k) < n//k.

Wait, I'm getting tangled.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set up s=2 stalls.

Let p1 and p2.

Then, total jewels = floor(n / p1) + floor((n - floor(n / p1) * p1) / p2).

I need this to be equal to k.

This seems too complex to solve directly.

Perhaps, I can fix p1 and then choose p2 accordingly.

But this seems involved.

Let me consider that with s=2, I can cover more values of k.

In the first example, with s=2, p1=3, p2=1, total jewels=2+1=3, which matches k=3.

In another setup, p1=2, p2=1, total jewels=3+0=3.

Wait, in the earlier analysis, with p1=2, p2=1, total jewels=3+0=3, which matches k=3.

Hence, it's possible with s=2.

But in the second example, n=6, k=4, it's not possible with s=2.

Hence, perhaps, for some n and k, it's impossible to reach exactly k, even with s <=60.

Hence, I need to find a general condition to determine when it's possible.

Let me consider that the total jewels bought is the sum of floor(n / p_i) minus the overlap due to the remaining coins.

Wait, that's still too vague.

An alternative approach is to consider that the total jewels bought is equal to the number of times Alice can buy jewels from the stalls, given the remaining coins.

This seems too abstract.

Let me consider that the minimal number of stalls needed is ceil(k - (n -k)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal jewels bought with s stalls.

With s=1:

Minimal jewels: 0 (if p1 >n)

Maximal jewels: floor(n / p1), for p1=1, which is n.

With s=2:

Minimal jewels: 0 (if p1 >n and p2 >n)

Maximal jewels: n (if p1=1 and p2=1)

But in practice, with s=2, p1=1 and p2=1, total jewels=n+0=n.

Wait, no, as in earlier examples, with p1=1, buys n jewels, spends n coins, leaves 0 coins for p2.

Hence, total jewels=n.

Wait, but in the first example, with p1=3 and p2=1, total jewels=2+1=3.

Hence, with s=2, it's possible to get k=3.

But in the second example, with s=2, p1=2 and p2=1, total jewels=3+0=3, which is less than k=4.

With p1=3 and p2=1, total jewels=2+0=2, which is less than 4.

With p1=1 and p2=1, total jewels=6+0=6, which is more than 4.

Hence, with s=2, it's not possible to get exactly k=4.

Hence, perhaps, for some n and k, it's impossible to reach exactly k, even with s <=60.

Hence, I need to find a general condition to determine when it's possible.

Let me consider that the total jewels bought is equal to the sum of floor(n / p_i) minus the overlap due to the remaining coins.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative approach is to consider that the total jewels bought is equal to the number of times Alice can buy jewels from the stalls, given the remaining coins.

This still doesn't give me a clear path to the solution.

Let me consider that with s stalls, I can control the number of jewels bought at each stall by setting the prices appropriately.

Hence, perhaps, I can set the prices such that Alice buys a certain number of jewels at each stall, summing up to k.

But how to determine the prices?

Let me consider that I set p1 such that floor(n / p1) =a1, then set p2 such that floor((n -a1*p1)/p2)=a2, and so on, with a1 +a2 +...+as =k.

But this seems too vague to implement.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

Start with s=1.

Set p1 = n //k.

Then, floor(n / p1) =k, if n -k*p1 < p1.

If yes, then output "YES" with s=1 and p1.

Else, try s=2.

Set p1 = n //k.

Then, remaining coins =n - floor(n / p1) * p1.

Then, set p2 = remaining_coins // (k - floor(n / p1)).

And so on.

But this seems too involved.

Let me think about the constraints again.

Given that s <=60, and p_i can be up to 10^18, and n and k can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to determine if it's possible.

Perhaps, it's possible to show that for any n and k where k <=n, and certain conditions hold, it's possible to set up s <=60 stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But I need to find a general method.

Let me consider that with s stalls, I can make Alice buy any k between 1 and n, as long as k <=n.

But in the second example, n=6, k=4, it's "NO".

Hence, there must be some constraints.

Let me consider that the minimal k is s, when p_i >n for all i, but then Alice buys 0 jewels from each stall, which contradicts.

Wait, no, if p_i >n, Alice buys 0 jewels from that stall.

Hence, with s stalls with p_i >n, total jewels=0.

If p_i <=n, Alice buys at least one jewel from the first stall, and possibly more.

Hence, minimal k is 0 (with p_i >n), and maximal k is n (with p_i=1).

But I need to reach exactly k.

Given that s <=60, perhaps I can use binary representation or some other decomposition to reach any k between 1 and n.

But in the second example, it's not possible for k=4 with n=6.

Hence, perhaps, only certain values of k are achievable, based on n.

Let me consider that k is achievable if and only if there exists a combination of s <=60 stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n / p_i) over i, with the remaining coins updating after each stall, equals k.

This seems too vague to work with.

An alternative approach is to consider that the problem can be modeled as a system of equations, but with integer divisions, it's not straightforward.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a simpler condition to determine if it's possible or not.

Let me consider that if k <=n, and k >=1, then it's possible, except for some specific cases like n=6, k=4.

Hence, perhaps, it's possible unless n <k*(k+1)/2.

Wait, that's the condition for triangular numbers.

But in the second example, n=6, k=4.

4*(4+1)/2=10 >6, hence, it's impossible.

Similarly, in the first example, n=7, k=3.

3*(3+1)/2=6 <=7, hence, possible.

In the third example, n=255, k=8.

8*(8+1)/2=36 <=255, hence, possible.

Hence, perhaps, it's possible if and only if k*(k+1)/2 <=n.

Let me test this condition.

First example: k=3, 3*4/2=6 <=7, possible.

Second example: k=4, 4*5/2=10 >6, impossible.

Third example: k=8, 8*9/2=36 <=255, possible.

Hence, perhaps, the condition is k*(k+1)/2 <=n.

If yes, output "YES" and provide a possible setup.

Else, "NO".

Let me see if this holds.

Suppose n=10, k=4.

4*5/2=10 <=10, should be possible.

Set up s=4 stalls with p1=1, p2=1, p3=1, p4=1.

Then, Alice buys 10 jewels from the first stall, spends 10 coins, left with 0.

Total jewels:10, which is more than k=4.

Not good.

Wait, perhaps I need to set p1=3, p2=2, p3=1, p4=1.

- At p1=3, buys 3 jewels, spends 9 coins, left with 1.

- At p2=2, buys 0 jewels.

- At p3=1, buys 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0.

- At p4=1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels:4.

Hence, it's possible.

Another case: n=10, k=3.

3*4/2=6 <=10, should be possible.

Set p1=4, p2=3, p3=2.

- At p1=4, buys 2 jewels, spends 8 coins, left with 2.

- At p2=3, buys 0 jewels.

- At p3=2, buys 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:3.

Hence, possible.

Another case: n=5, k=2.

2*3/2=3 <=5, should be possible.

Set p1=3, p2=2.

- At p1=3, buys 1 jewel, spends 3 coins, left with 2.

- At p2=2, buys 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

Hence, possible.

Another case: n=3, k=2.

2*3/2=3 <=3, should be possible.

Set p1=2, p2=1.

- At p1=2, buys 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, left with 1.

- At p2=1, buys 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0.

- Total jewels:2.

Hence, possible.

Another case: n=4, k=3.

3*4/2=6 >4, should be impossible.

Hence, "NO".

Wait, but according to the earlier condition, it should be impossible.

Let me check.

Set p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

- At p1=2, buys 2 jewels, spends 4 coins, left with 0.

- At p2=1, buys 0 jewels.

- At p3=1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels:2, which is less than 3.

Alternatively, set p1=1, p2=1, p3=1.

- At p1=1, buys 4 jewels, spends 4 coins, left with 0.

- At p2=1, buys 0 jewels.

- At p3=1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels:4, which is more than 3.

Hence, it's impossible to get exactly k=3 with n=4, even with s=3.

Hence, the condition k*(k+1)/2 <=n seems to hold.

Hence, perhaps, the general condition is that it's possible if and only if k*(k+1)/2 <=n.

Hence, in the code, I can check if k*(k+1)/2 <=n.

If yes, output "YES" and provide a setup.

Else, "NO".

To provide a setup, I can set up s=k stalls with prices p_i = n - (k -i), for i=1 to k.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the earlier example, with n=10, k=3, I set p1=4, p2=3, p3=2, which worked.

Similarly, in n=5, k=2, set p1=3, p2=2.

Hence, perhaps, set p_i = n - (k -i), for i=1 to k.

Wait, in n=10, k=3:

p1=10 - (3 -1)=8

p2=10 - (3 -2)=7

p3=10 - (3 -3)=6

But with p1=8, p2=7, p3=6:

- At p1=8, buys 1 jewel, spends 8 coins, left with 2.

- At p2=7, buys 0 jewels.

- At p3=6, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels:1, which is less than 3.

Not good.

Hence, this pricing strategy doesn't work.

Alternative strategy: set p_i = n - (i-1), for i=1 to k.

In n=10, k=3:

p1=10 -0=10

p2=10 -1=9

p3=10 -2=8

- At p1=10, buys 1 jewel, spends 10 coins, left with 0.

- At p2=9, buys 0 jewels.

- At p3=8, buys 0 jewels.

- Total jewels:1, which is less than 3.

Not
