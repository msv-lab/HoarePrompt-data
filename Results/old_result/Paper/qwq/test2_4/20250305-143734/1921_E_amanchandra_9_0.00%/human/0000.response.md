Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game on a checkered board where Alice and Bob are moving their chips according to specific rules, and I need to determine who wins or if it's a draw when both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game setup. The board has h rows and w columns, with rows numbered from 1 to h from top to bottom, and columns numbered from 1 to w from left to right. Alice starts at (x_a, y_a) and Bob at (x_b, y_b). Alice moves first.

Alice can move her chip down, down-right, or down-left, meaning her row increases by 1 each move, and her column can stay the same or change by at most 1. Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left, so his row decreases by 1 each move, and his column can stay the same or change by at most 1.

The game ends immediately if a player moves their chip to the position occupied by the other player's chip, and that player wins. If a player cannot make a move—Alice if she's in the last row, Bob if he's in the first row—the game ends in a draw.

Given multiple test cases, I need to determine for each case whether Alice wins, Bob wins, or it's a draw, assuming both play optimally.

Okay, let's think about the game mechanics.

First, note that Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left, so her row increases with each move. Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left, so his row decreases with each move.

This means their rows are moving towards each other: Alice up, Bob down. The game can only progress as long as Alice's row is less than Bob's row because once Alice's row is equal to or greater than Bob's, no more moves can be made.

Wait, but the problem says that if xa > xb at any point, the game ends in a draw. So, if Alice's row becomes greater than or equal to Bob's row, the game ends in a draw.

But in the game, Alice moves first, and on her turn, she increases her row by 1, and Bob decreases his row by 1. So, the difference in their rows changes with each move.

Let me try to model the number of moves they can make.

Let’s define the initial difference in rows as d = xb - xa. Since xa < xb initially (as per the problem's guarantee that xa ≠ xb or ya ≠ yb, but considering the rows, it's likely xa < xb).

So, d is the number of rows Alice needs to cover to reach Bob's row.

But Alice moves down (increases xa by 1), and Bob moves up (decreases xb by 1). So, effectively, the difference in their rows decreases by 2 with each full round of moves (Alice's move followed by Bob's move).

Wait, let's think in terms of turns.

Each turn consists of Alice moving first, then Bob moving, and so on.

So, in one full turn:

- Alice moves down by 1 row.

- Bob moves up by 1 row.

Hence, the difference in their rows decreases by 2 with each full turn.

So, the number of full turns possible is floor(d / 2).

After these full turns, the difference in rows would be d - 2 * floor(d / 2), which is d mod 2.

If d is even, then after floor(d / 2) turns, their rows will be equal.

If d is odd, after floor(d / 2) turns, the difference will be 1.

Now, in the case where d is even:

- After floor(d / 2) turns, xa = xb.

At this point, if their columns are the same, Alice wins by moving to Bob's position.

But Bob can try to avoid that by moving his chip away from Alice's possible moves.

Wait, but Alice moves first in the last turn as well.

So, in the last turn:

- Alice moves first, to xa + 1, and then Bob moves to xb - 1.

But since d is even, after floor(d / 2) turns, xa = xb.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Let’s consider the number of moves Alice can make before she cannot move further or the game ends.

Alice can move down up to h - xa times, but the game might end earlier.

Similarly, Bob can move up up to xb - 1 times.

But since Alice moves first, she can influence the game's progression.

I need to find a way to determine if Alice can force a win, Bob can force a win, or it's a draw.

Perhaps I can model this as a game where the state is determined by the current positions of both chips, and see who can force a win.

But with h up to 10^6 and w up to 10^9, and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way, probably O(1) per test case.

Looking at the reference solution, it seems to have found such an efficient way.

Let me try to understand the reference solution.

The function reads the input values: h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb.

Then, it checks if xa > xb. If so, it prints 'Draw'.

Else, it calculates x = floor((xa - xb) / 2).

Wait, xa - xb is negative since xa < xb, so floor of a negative number.

Wait, no, it's abs(xa - xb) // 2.

Wait, in the code, it's written as x = abs(xa - xb) // 2.

Given that xa < xb, abs(xa - xb) is xb - xa.

So, x = (xb - xa) // 2.

Then, it checks if (xb - xa) % 2 == 1.

If it's odd, it calculates l = max(1, yb - x) and r = min(w, yb + x).

Then, it checks if abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1.

If both are true, it's Alice; else, it's a Draw.

If (xb - xa) % 2 == 0:

It calculates l = max(1, ya - x)

r = min(w, yb + x)

Then, checks if abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x.

If both, Bob; else, Draw.

This seems optimized for O(1) per test case.

But I need to understand why this works.

Let me think about the game progression.

As mentioned earlier, the difference in rows decreases by 2 for each full turn (Alice and Bob both move once).

If the initial difference in rows is even, after x = (xb - xa) // 2 turns, Alice and Bob will be in the same row.

If the difference is odd, after x = (xb - xa) // 2 turns, the difference in rows will be 1, with Alice one row below Bob.

At that point, Alice cannot move up anymore because she can't decrease her row, and Bob cannot move down anymore because he can't increase his row.

Wait, no, Alice can still move down, but if xa >= xb, the game ends in a draw.

Wait, the problem says that if xa >= xb at any point, the game ends in a draw.

Wait, no: "If either player cannot make a move (Alice if she is in the last row, i.e., xa = h, Bob if he is in the first row, i.e., xb = 1), the game immediately ends in a draw."

But in the reference solution, it checks if xa > xb, and if so, it's a Draw.

Wait, but according to the problem, the game ends in a draw only if a player cannot make a move, which is when Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row.

But in the reference solution, it checks if xa > xb, and if so, it's a Draw.

Is this always true?

Wait, in the example input, there's a case where xa > xb, and the output is 'Draw'.

But according to the problem, the game ends in a draw only if a player cannot make a move.

But in the reference solution, it seems to consider any xa >= xb as a draw.

Wait, in the code, it's xa > xb.

Wait, in the problem, it's if xa >= xb, the game ends in a draw.

So, perhaps the reference solution is considering xa > xb as a draw, and xa == xb needs separate handling.

But in the problem statement, it's only if xa >= xb at any point, the game ends in a draw.

Wait, no, it's if a player cannot make a move:

- Alice cannot make a move if xa = h.

- Bob cannot make a move if xb = 1.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Let me check the problem statement again.

" The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ x' ≤ h and 1 ≤ y' ≤ w.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the other player's chip.

If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ), the game immediately ends in a draw."

So, the game ends in a draw only if a player cannot make a move, which is when:

- Alice is in the last row (x_a = h), regardless of Bob's position.

- Bob is in the first row (x_b = 1), regardless of Alice's position.

It does not say that if xa >= xb, the game ends in a draw.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Let me read it again.

"If either player cannot make a move (Alice if she is in the last row, i.e., x_a = h, Bob if x_b = 1), the game immediately ends in a draw."

So, only if Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, the game ends in a draw.

Not necessarily when xa >= xb.

In the reference solution, it checks if xa > xb, and if so, it's a Draw.

But according to the problem, the game only ends in a draw if xa = h or xb = 1.

So, perhaps the reference solution is incorrect in this aspect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

If xa > xb initially, then since Alice can only move down (increase xa), and Bob can only move up (decrease xb), their rows will never overlap, meaning they can't capture each other's chips.

Hence, the game will end in a draw.

Is that the reasoning behind the reference solution?

Wait, but according to the problem, the game ends in a draw only if a player cannot make a move, which is when Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row.

But if xa > xb initially, and Alice can only increase xa and Bob can only decrease xb, then their rows will never overlap, meaning neither can capture the other's chip.

Eventually, Alice will reach xa = h or Bob will reach xb = 1, whichever comes first, and the game will end in a draw.

Hence, if xa > xb initially, it's a Draw.

Otherwise, we need to see who can capture the other's chip.

So, in the reference solution, it checks if xa > xb, and if so, prints 'Draw'.

Else, it proceeds to calculate based on the number of moves.

This seems consistent with the problem's rules.

Now, let's consider the case when xa <= xb.

We need to see who can capture the other's chip.

Let's think in terms of the number of moves until they are in the same row.

As mentioned earlier, the difference in rows is d = xb - xa.

Each full turn (Alice moves down, Bob moves up) reduces the difference by 2.

So, after x = floor(d / 2) moves, the difference will be d - 2x.

If d is even, d - 2x = 0, meaning they are in the same row.

If d is odd, d - 2x = 1, meaning Alice is one row below Bob.

Now, let's consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: d is even.

After x = d / 2 moves, xa = xa + x, and xb = xb - x.

Since d is even, xa + x = xb - x.

Hence, xa = xb.

Now, in this situation, it's Alice's turn because she moves first.

But wait, after x full turns, it's Bob's turn because Alice moves first in each turn.

Wait, each turn consists of Alice moving first, then Bob moving.

So, after x full turns, it's Alice's turn again.

Wait, no, a full turn is Alice's move followed by Bob's move.

So, after x full turns, the next move is Alice's.

But in the reference solution, it calculates x = (xb - xa) // 2.

Then, for even d:

It calculates l = max(1, ya - x)

r = min(w, yb + x)

Then, checks if abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x.

If both, Bob wins; else, Draw.

Wait, this seems confusing.

Maybe I need to think in terms of possible column positions after x moves.

Let me try to model the possible column positions for both Alice and Bob after x moves.

First, for Alice:

Starting at (xa, ya), after x moves, her row will be xa + x.

Similarly, Bob starts at (xb, yb), after x moves, his row will be xb - x.

If d is even, xa + x = xb - x.

If d is odd, xa + x = xb - x - 1.

So, for even d:

After x = (xb - xa) // 2 moves, xa + x = xb - x.

Hence, they are in the same row.

Now, in this row, Alice can be in columns ranging from ya - x to ya + x, because each move can change her column by at most 1.

Similarly, Bob can be in columns ranging from yb - x to yb + x.

Wait, but Bob has moved up x times, each time potentially changing his column by at most 1.

So, after x moves, Bob's possible columns are yb - x to yb + x.

Similarly, Alice's possible columns are ya - x to ya + x.

But Alice moves first in the last turn as well.

Wait, but in the reference solution, for even d:

It calculates l = max(1, ya - x)

r = min(w, yb + x)

Then checks if abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x.

If both, Bob wins; else, Draw.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to see if Bob can position himself such that Alice cannot capture him.

Alternatively, perhaps it's checking if Bob can stay outside Alice's possible capture range.

I'm getting a bit lost here.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can model the game as a race to minimize or maximize the column distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference in columns.

Let’s define the initial column difference as c = yb - ya.

Then, in each move, Alice can change her column by at most 1, and Bob can change his column by at most 1.

Wait, but their row movements are deterministic: Alice always increases row by 1, Bob decreases row by 1.

Hence, their column positions are the only variables they can control.

So, perhaps I can model the possible column positions over time.

Let’s consider the number of moves until they are in the same row.

As earlier, if d is even, after x = d / 2 moves, they are in the same row.

If d is odd, after x = floor(d / 2) moves, the difference in rows is 1, with Alice one row below Bob.

In the even case, they are in the same row, and it's Alice's turn.

Alice can move to any column between ya - x to ya + x.

Similarly, Bob can move to any column between yb - x to yb + x.

If their possible column ranges overlap, Alice can choose a column that matches Bob's column, capturing Bob's chip and winning.

Otherwise, Bob can position himself outside Alice's reachable columns, forcing a draw.

Wait, but according to the reference solution, it's checking some conditions based on l and r.

I need to see if my reasoning aligns with the reference solution.

Similarly, for odd d, after x moves, the row difference is 1, with Alice one row below Bob.

In this case, Alice cannot capture Bob's chip because she can't move up.

Bob also cannot capture Alice's chip because he can't move down.

Hence, the game ends in a draw unless somehow one of them can force a win.

But according to the reference solution, for odd d, it checks if Alice can capture Bob in the next move.

Wait, perhaps I need to look into more detail.

Let me consider some examples to verify.

Take the first example input:

6 5 2 2 5 3

Here, h=6, w=5, xa=2, ya=2, xb=5, yb=3.

d = xb - xa = 3, which is odd.

x = floor(3 / 2) = 1.

So, after 1 move:

Alice moves to xa + 1 = 3, ya can be 1,2,3.

Bob moves to xb - 1 = 4, yb can be 2,3,4.

Now, the difference in rows is 4 - 3 = 1, which is odd.

Alice cannot capture Bob because she is one row below him, and she can't move up.

Bob also cannot capture Alice because he can't move down.

Hence, it's a draw.

But according to the reference solution, it prints 'Alice'.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe in this specific configuration, Alice can force a win.

Let me think step by step.

Initial positions: Alice at (2,2), Bob at (5,3).

Alice moves first:

She can move to (3,1), (3,2), or (3,3).

Then Bob moves:

From (5,3), he can move to (4,2), (4,3), or (4,4).

Now, Alice is at row 3, Bob at row 4.

Alice can't capture Bob because she can't reach row 4.

Bob can't capture Alice because he can't reach row 3.

So, it seems like a draw.

But the reference solution outputs 'Alice'.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe in some specific moves, Alice can force a win.

Let me look at another example.

Take the second input:

4 1 2 1 4 1

Here, h=4, w=1, xa=2, ya=1, xb=4, yb=1.

d = 4 - 2 = 2, which is even.

x = 2 // 2 = 1.

After 1 full turn:

Alice moves to (3,1), Bob moves to (3,1).

Now, they are both at (3,1), so Alice captures Bob's position and wins.

But according to the reference solution, it prints 'Bob'.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I need to see the exact logic in the reference solution.

In the reference solution, for even d:

It calculates l = max(1, ya - x)

r = min(w, yb + x)

Then checks if abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x.

If both, Bob wins; else, Draw.

In this case, h=4, w=1, xa=2, ya=1, xb=4, yb=1.

d = 2, x = 1.

l = max(1,1-1) = 1

r = min(1,1+1) = 1

Now, check if abs(1 - 1) <=1 and abs(1 -1) <=1.

Both are true, so Bob wins.

But according to my earlier reasoning, Alice and Bob end up in the same cell, so Alice wins.

This suggests that the reference solution might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the reference solution's logic.

Looking back at the reference solution:

if xa > xb:

print('Draw')

else:

x = abs(xa - xb) // 2

if abs(xa - xb) % 2:

l = max(1, yb - x)

r = min(w, yb + x)

print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])

else:

l = max(1, ya - x)

r = min(w, yb + x)

print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])

In the second example, d=2, which is even.

So, x=1.

Then, l = max(1,1-1)=1

r = min(1,1+1)=1

Check if abs(1-1)<=1 and abs(1-1)<=1.

Both are true, so Bob wins.

But according to the problem, Alice should win because she captures Bob's position.

Hence, the reference solution seems incorrect in this case.

Looking back at the problem's example output, for the second input, it's 'Bob', but according to my reasoning, it should be 'Alice'.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me check the problem's example output again.

Wait, the second input is:

4 1 2 1 4 1

And the output is 'Bob'.

But according to my reasoning, it should be 'Alice'.

Is there something wrong with my reasoning?

Let me think again.

Alice starts at (2,1), Bob at (4,1).

Alice moves first:

She can move to (3,1).

Bob then moves to (3,1).

Now, they are both at (3,1), so Alice captures Bob's position and wins.

Hence, it should be 'Alice'.

But the reference solution outputs 'Bob'.

This suggests that the reference solution is incorrect for this case.

Wait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation in the reference solution.

Looking back at the reference solution's logic for even d:

It seems to be checking if Bob can stay outside Alice's reachable range.

But in this case, they end up in the same position, so Alice wins.

Hence, the reference solution is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
