Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I need to find the minimum number of operations required to increase its median. An operation is defined as choosing an element in the array and increasing it by 1.

First, I need to understand what a median is. The median is the middle element in a sorted version of the array. For an array of length n, the median is at position ceil(n/2) when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

For example, if n is 5, the median is at position 3 (since ceil(5/2) is 3). If n is 4, the median is at position 2 (ceil(4/2) is 2).

My goal is to increase the median value by performing the least number of operations possible. Each operation allows me to pick any element in the array and increment it by 1.

I need to think about how increasing elements affects the median.

Let me consider a simple example:

Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3]. The median is 2. If I want to increase the median to 3, I need to make sure that the median value becomes 3.

But in this case, the median is already less than 3, and the array is already sorted. If I increase the second element to 3, the array becomes [1, 3, 3], and the median is now 3. That took only one operation.

Wait, but according to the problem, I can choose any element to increase, not just the median.

Let me think about another example:

Array: [1, 2, 2, 8]. n=4, ceil(4/2)=2. So the median is the 2nd element in the sorted array, which is 2.

I want to increase the median above its current value, which is 2.

Option 1: Increase one of the 2's to 3. Array becomes [1,2,3,8]. Sorted: [1,2,3,8]. Median is the average of 2nd and 3rd elements, which is (2+3)/2 = 2.5. That's greater than 2, so it works. Operations: 1.

Option 2: Increase the 1 to 2. Array becomes [2,2,2,8]. Sorted: [2,2,2,8]. Median is (2+2)/2 = 2, which is not greater than 2.

So, option 1 is better.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for n=4, the median is the 2nd element, not the average. Wait, I need to check that.

In the problem description, it says "the median of the array q1,q2,…,qk is the number p⌈k/2⌉, where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order."

So, for n=4, ceil(4/2)=2, so the median is the 2nd element in the sorted array.

In my previous example, [1,2,2,8], sorted is [1,2,2,8], median is 2.

If I increase one of the 2's to 3, array becomes [1,2,3,8], sorted [1,2,3,8], median is 2.

Wait, that's not increasing the median.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, in the example provided in the problem, for n=4, [7,3,3,1], sorted is [1,3,3,7], median is the 2nd element, which is 3.

If I increase one of the 3's to 4, array becomes [7,4,3,1], sorted [1,3,4,7], median is 3.

That's not an increase.

Wait, maybe I need to increase enough elements to make the median larger.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider increasing the median element itself or other elements to shift the median.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that to increase the median, I need to make sure that the ceil(n/2)-th element in the sorted array is larger than its current value.

But I can choose to increase any elements, not necessarily the median element.

Wait, perhaps it's strategic to increase the smallest elements to make the median larger.

Wait, no, maybe I should focus on the elements that affect the median position.

Let me think about the sorted array.

Suppose I have a sorted array: a1, a2, ..., an.

The median is a_m, where m = ceil(n/2).

To increase the median, I need to make a_m larger.

But I can choose to increase any a_i, including a_m.

But increasing a_m directly would be the most efficient way, right?

Wait, but in the earlier example, increasing a_m didn't necessarily increase the median.

Wait, in the case where n=4, a=[1,2,2,8], sorted is [1,2,2,8], m=2, median is 2.

If I increase one of the 2's to 3, array becomes [1,2,3,8], sorted [1,2,3,8], median is still 2.

Wait, that's strange.

According to the problem description, for n=4, median is the 2nd element, which is 2.

But in the sorted array [1,2,3,8], the 2nd element is still 2.

So, increasing one element didn't help.

Wait, perhaps I need to increase multiple elements.

If I increase both 2's to 3, array becomes [1,3,3,8], sorted [1,3,3,8], median is 3.

That's better.

So, it took two operations to increase the median from 2 to 3.

Is there a way to do it with fewer operations?

Wait, if I only increase one 2 to 3, it becomes [1,2,3,8], median is still 2.

So, two operations is the minimum.

But is there a smarter way?

Wait, maybe if I increase the smallest element to a higher value.

If I increase 1 to 3, array becomes [3,2,2,8], sorted [2,2,3,8], median is 2.

No, that didn't help.

Or increase 1 to 4, array becomes [4,2,2,8], sorted [2,2,4,8], median is 2.

Still no.

So, seems like I need to focus on increasing the elements around the median position.

In this case, increasing both the 2's to 3.

Wait, but in general, how do I find the minimal number of operations?

Let me think about the sorted array.

Suppose I have the sorted array: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

The median is a_m, where m = ceil(n/2).

To increase the median, I need to make a_m larger.

The minimal value I can make a_m is the next integer greater than its current value.

So, if a_m is currently x, I need to make it at least x+1.

To do that, I can choose to increase a_m directly, but since I can choose any element, I might choose to increase other elements to make a_m larger indirectly.

Wait, but in practice, to make a_m larger, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are larger than or equal to some value.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of making the k-th smallest element larger.

Let me consider that.

I need to make the ceil(n/2)-th smallest element larger than its current value.

To do that, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are larger than the current median.

Let me denote m = ceil(n/2).

Current median is a_m.

I need to make a_m >= a_m + 1.

Wait, no.

I need to make a_m > current a_m.

Specifically, to make a_m at least current a_m + 1.

So, target a_m = current a_m + 1.

To achieve this, I need to make sure that at least m elements are >= target a_m.

Currently, how many elements are >= target a_m?

Let's say I have the sorted array: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Let's say current a_m is x.

I want to make a_m >= x+1.

To do that, I need to make sure that at least m elements are >= x+1.

Currently, how many elements are >= x+1?

Let's say currently, in the sorted array, from a_k to a_n are >= x+1, where k is the smallest index such that a_k >= x+1.

Then, the number of elements currently >= x+1 is n - k + 1.

I need at least m elements to be >= x+1.

So, the number of elements I need to increase is max(0, m - (n - k + 1)).

Each operation can increase one element by 1.

So, for each element less than x+1, I need to increase it until it's >= x+1.

The total operations would be the sum, for each element < x+1, of (x+1 - a_i).

Wait, but that might not be minimal.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that I can choose which elements to increase.

I need to select the smallest elements to increase to make them >= x+1, until I have at least m elements that are >= x+1.

Wait, actually, to minimize the operations, I should focus on increasing the elements that are just below x+1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to sort the array and then see how much to increase the necessary elements.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Let's denote the sorted array as b1 <= b2 <= ... <= bn.

The median is b_m, where m = ceil(n/2).

I need to make b_m as large as possible with minimal operations.

Wait, no, I need to make b_m larger than its current value, specifically to b_m + 1.

Wait, no, I need to increase the median, i.e., make b_m larger.

The minimal increase is to make b_m >= current b_m + 1.

To do that, I need to make sure that at least m elements are >= b_m + 1.

In the sorted array, the elements from b_k to b_n are >= b_m + 1, where k is the smallest index such that b_k >= b_m + 1.

So, the number of elements already >= b_m + 1 is n - k + 1.

I need at least m elements to be >= b_m + 1.

So, the number of elements I need to increase is max(0, m - (n - k + 1)).

These are the elements from b1 to b_{k-1}, which are < b_m + 1.

For each of these elements, I need to increase them to at least b_m + 1.

So, the total operations needed would be the sum over b1 to b_{k-1} of (b_m + 1 - b_i).

Wait, but in practice, I need to make sure that after increases, at least m elements are >= b_m + 1.

But since I can choose which elements to increase, it's most efficient to increase the smallest elements to reach b_m + 1.

Wait, but actually, I need to make sure that the m-th element is >= b_m + 1.

So, in the sorted array, to make b_m >= b_m + 1, I need to make sure that b_m >= b_m + 1.

But b_m is currently less than b_m + 1, so I need to increase it.

But I can choose to increase any elements, not necessarily b_m.

Wait, but to make b_m >= b_m + 1, I need to make sure that at least m elements are >= b_m + 1.

In the sorted array, the elements from b_k to b_n are >= b_m + 1, where k is the smallest index where b_k >= b_m + 1.

So, the number of elements already >= b_m + 1 is n - k + 1.

I need at least m elements to be >= b_m + 1.

Therefore, the number of elements I need to increase is m - (n - k + 1), if m - (n - k + 1) > 0.

Each of these elements needs to be increased to at least b_m + 1.

The minimal operations would be the sum over the first (m - (n - k + 1)) elements of (b_m + 1 - b_i).

Wait, this seems a bit complicated.

Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that to make the median >= b_m + 1, I need to make sure that at least m elements are >= b_m + 1.

So, I need to find the smallest m elements in the sorted array and make sure they are >= b_m + 1.

Wait, but the sorted array is b1 <= b2 <= ... <= bn.

So, to make the m-th element >= b_m + 1, I need to make sure that b_m >= b_m + 1.

But b_m is currently less than b_m + 1, so I need to increase it.

But I can choose to increase other elements as well.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to fix the sorted array and calculate how much to increase the necessary elements.

Let me try with an example.

Take n=4, a=[7,3,3,1].

Sorted: [1,3,3,7].

m=ceil(4/2)=2.

Current median is b_2=3.

I want to make sure that at least 2 elements are >= 4 (since 3 + 1 = 4).

Looking at the sorted array: [1,3,3,7].

Elements >=4: only 7.

So, currently, only 1 element >=4.

I need at least 2 elements >=4.

So, I need to increase one more element to be >=4.

The smallest element to increase would be 3, to make it 4.

So, increase one 3 to 4.

Now, the array is [1,3,4,7].

Elements >=4: 4 and 7 (2 elements).

So, the new median is the 2nd element, which is 3.

Wait, but according to the problem, the median is the 2nd element, which is 3.

But I need it to be greater than the original median, which was 3.

So, in this case, it's still 3, which is not greater.

Wait, that's not sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that the m-th element is >= b_m + 1.

In this case, m=2, b_m=3, b_m +1=4.

So, I need to make sure that b_2 >=4.

In the sorted array [1,3,4,7], b_2=3, which is less than 4.

So, it's not sufficient.

Wait, I need to make b_2 >=4.

To do that, I need to make sure that the 2nd smallest element is at least 4.

So, in the sorted array, the first two elements should be >=4.

Currently, they are 1 and 3.

So, I need to make both of them >=4.

That would require increasing 1 to 4 (3 operations) and 3 to 4 (1 operation).

Total operations: 4.

But in the example provided in the problem, for n=4, a=[7,3,3,1], the output is 2.

Wait, that's different from what I just calculated.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the problem's example, for n=4, a=[7,3,3,1], the output is 2.

But according to my previous calculation, it would take 4 operations.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at the problem's example again.

In the fifth test case:

Input:

6

2 1 2 3 1 4

Output:

2

So, for n=6, a=[2,1,2,3,1,4], sorted is [1,1,2,2,3,4], m=ceil(6/2)=3, median is 2.

I need to make the median >2, i.e., >=3.

To make the 3rd element >=3.

In the sorted array, the 3rd element is 2.

To make it 3, I need to make sure that at least 3 elements are >=3.

Currently, elements >=3 are 3 and 4 (2 elements).

So, I need to make one more element >=3.

The smallest element to increase would be the smallest element <3, which is 2.

So, increase one 2 to 3.

Now, the array is [1,1,3,2,3,4], sorted [1,1,2,3,3,4], 3rd element is 2, which is still <3.

So, that's not enough.

Need to increase another element.

Increase another 2 to 3.

Now, array is [1,1,3,3,3,4], sorted [1,1,3,3,3,4], 3rd element is 3, which is >=3.

So, it took two operations.

That matches the problem's output.

So, in this case, I needed to make sure that at least m=3 elements are >=3.

Initially, there were 2 elements >=3, so needed to increase 3 - 2 =1 elements.

But in practice, it took two operations because I had to increase two elements to reach that.

Wait, why is that?

Ah, because the elements to be increased need to be increased enough to meet the target.

In this case, I had two 2's to increase to 3, each requiring 1 operation, total 2 operations.

So, it's not just the number of elements to increase, but also how much each needs to be increased.

So, generalizing, to make at least m elements >= target, I need to consider the elements that are < target and see how much to increase them to reach the target.

So, the minimal operations would be the sum over the first (m - count_of_elements_ge_target) elements that are < target of (target - element).

In this example, m=3, count_of_elements_ge_target=2, so need to increase 3-2=1 elements.

But since there are two elements that are 2, which are <3, I need to increase both of them to 3, which takes 1 operation each, total 2 operations.

Wait, why is it 3 - 2 =1, but I need to increase 2 elements?

Ah, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Let me think again.

Number of elements that need to be increased = m - number of elements already >= target.

In this case, m=3, number of elements >=3 is 2, so need to increase 3 - 2 =1 element.

But in reality, I had to increase 2 elements to make sure that the 3rd element is >=3.

Wait, perhaps I need to increase the smallest m elements to be >= target.

So, in the sorted array [1,1,2,2,3,4], I need to make sure that the first m=3 elements are >=3.

But that's not practical, as it would require increasing 1 to 3 (2 operations), 1 to 3 (2 operations), and 2 to 3 (1 operation), total 5 operations.

But in reality, I only needed to make sure that at least m elements are >=3.

So, I need to select which elements to increase.

To minimize operations, I should select the elements that are closest to the target.

So, in this case, I have two elements that are 2, which are less than 3.

I need to make at least m - count_of_elements_ge_target elements >=3.

In this case, m=3, count_of_elements_ge_target=2, so need to make 1 more element >=3.

But in practice, since there are two elements that are 2, I need to increase both of them to 3 to ensure that the 3rd element is >=3.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I only increase one 2 to 3, the array becomes [1,1,3,2,3,4], sorted [1,1,2,3,3,4], the 3rd element is 2, which is less than 3.

So, it's not sufficient.

I need to increase both 2's to 3.

Then, the array is [1,1,3,3,3,4], sorted [1,1,3,3,3,4], the 3rd element is 3, which meets the requirement.

So, in this case, even though I only needed to make 1 more element >=3, I had to increase two elements because the elements are tied.

So, perhaps the formula is not straightforward.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have the sorted array: b1 <= b2 <= ... <= bn.

I need to make sure that bm >= target, where target = current bm +1.

So, in the sorted array, I need to make bm >= target.

To do that, I need to make sure that at least m elements are >= target.

So, count the number of elements that are already >= target.

Let's say there are k such elements.

Then, I need to make sure that at least m elements are >= target.

So, the number of elements I need to increase is m - k.

These are the elements from b1 to b_{m - k}.

Wait, no.

I need to make sure that the m-th element is >= target.

So, in the sorted array, bm needs to be >= target.

To achieve that, I need to make sure that the m-th element is >= target.

Which means that the first m-1 elements can be less than target, but the m-th element must be >= target.

Wait, no.

In the problem, the median is bm, and I need to make bm >= target.

So, in the sorted array, bm is the m-th smallest element.

To make bm >= target, I need to make sure that at least one of the first m elements is >= target.

Wait, no.

Actually, in a sorted array, bm is the m-th smallest element.

To make bm >= target, I need to make sure that at least m elements are >= target.

Because if less than m elements are >= target, then bm would be less than target.

Wait, no.

Wait, in a sorted array, b1 <= b2 <= ... <= bn.

The m-th smallest element is bm.

To make bm >= target, I need to make sure that at least m elements are >= target.

Because if fewer than m elements are >= target, then bm would be less than target.

So, the number of elements that are >= target should be at least m.

Current number of elements >= target is k.

If k >= m, then no operations are needed.

Else, I need to make m - k elements >= target.

To minimize operations, I should select the elements that are just below target and increase them just enough to reach target.

So, the operations needed would be the sum over the smallest m - k elements that are < target of (target - element).

In the previous example, m=3, target=3, k=2 (elements 3 and 4 are >=3).

So, m - k =1.

So, I need to increase 1 element to be >=3.

But in the sorted array [1,1,2,2,3,4], the elements <3 are [1,1,2,2].

I need to increase the smallest m - k =1 element among these to be >=3.

But increasing one element to 3 would make the array [1,1,2,3,3,4], sorted [1,1,2,3,3,4], bm=2 <3.

So, that's not sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to increase the m - k smallest elements to target.

Wait, in this case, m - k =1, so I need to increase one element to >=3.

But as seen, it's not enough.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that after increases, the m-th element is >= target.

So, in the sorted array, after increases, the m-th element should be >= target.

To achieve that, I need to make sure that the first m elements include at least m - k elements that are increased to >=target.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I have the sorted array: b1 <= b2 <= ... <= bn.

I need to make bm >= target.

To do that, I can increase some of the elements.

But since I can choose which elements to increase, it's most efficient to increase the elements that are below bm to make bm >= target.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on making sure that the m-th element is >= target.

To do that, I need to make sure that the first m elements include enough elements that are >=target.

Wait, perhaps it's better to fix the m-th element and make sure it's >=target.

So, in the sorted array, bm is the m-th smallest element.

To make bm >=target, I need to make sure that all elements after bm are >=target, but that's not necessarily true.

Wait, no.

Actually, in a sorted array, bm is the m-th smallest element.

To
