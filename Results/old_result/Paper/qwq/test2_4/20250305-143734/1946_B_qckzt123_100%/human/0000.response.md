Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I need to perform exactly K operations on it. In each operation, I can select any contiguous subarray (which could even be empty) and insert the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array. My goal is to maximize the sum of the array after K operations, and since the sum can be very large, I need to output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what exactly an operation does. When I select a subarray, calculate its sum, and insert that sum back into the array, where can I insert it? The problem says "anywhere in the array," so I can choose any position to insert this new element. Importantly, the subarray can be empty, and the sum of an empty subarray is 0.

Let me think about what happens when I perform such an operation. Suppose I have an array [A, B, C], and I choose the subarray [B, C] with sum (B + C), and I insert this sum before A, making the new array [(B + C), A, B, C]. Now, the sum of the array is (B + C) + A + B + C = A + 2B + 2C.

Alternatively, if I choose the entire array [A, B, C] with sum (A + B + C) and insert it at the end, the new array becomes [A, B, C, (A + B + C)], with a sum of A + B + C + (A + B + C) = 2(A + B + C).

It seems that inserting the sum of a subarray effectively adds that sum to the total sum of the array because I'm adding a new element equal to the sum of some subarray.

Wait a minute, if I insert the sum of a subarray, I'm adding that value to the array, which directly increases the sum of the array by that amount. So, each operation allows me to add the sum of any contiguous subarray (including the empty subarray, which sums to 0) to the array.

My goal is to maximize the sum after exactly K operations. So, I need to choose K subarrays, compute their sums, and insert those sums into the array in such a way that the total sum is maximized.

But, considering that each insertion increases the sum by the sum of the subarray chosen, it seems that I can maximize the sum by always choosing the subarray with the maximum possible sum and inserting it.

However, there might be a better strategy, especially since the array changes after each insertion, which could affect the possible subarrays and their sums.

Let me consider a simple example to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

n = 2, k = 2

a = [-4, -7]

In this case, the possible subarrays are:

- Subarray with first element: sum = -4

- Subarray with second element: sum = -7

- Subarray with both elements: sum = -11

- Empty subarray: sum = 0

The maximum sum I can add in each operation is 0, by choosing the empty subarray.

So, after two operations, I can add 0 twice, resulting in the array [-4, -7, 0, 0], with a sum of -11.

But, according to the example in the problem, the output is 999999996, which is -11 modulo 10^9 + 7.

Okay, so in this case, choosing the empty subarray and adding 0 is the best I can do.

Example 2:

n = 3, k = 3

a = [2, 2, 8]

Possible subarrays:

- [2]: sum = 2

- [2, 2]: sum = 4

- [2, 2, 8]: sum = 12

- [2]: sum = 2

- [8]: sum = 8

- Empty subarray: sum = 0

The best choice is to pick the subarray with the maximum sum, which is [2, 2, 8] with sum 12.

So, in the first operation, I can insert 12 into the array, say at the end: [2, 2, 8, 12]

Now, the sum is 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 = 24

In the second operation, I can again choose the entire array [2, 2, 8, 12] with sum 24 and insert it again: [2, 2, 8, 12, 24]

Sum now is 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 48

In the third operation, choose the entire array [2, 2, 8, 12, 24] with sum 48 and insert it: [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48]

Sum is 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96

And 96 modulo 10^9 + 7 is 96.

So, in this case, repeatedly choosing the entire array and inserting its sum leads to the maximum possible sum.

Another example:

n = 1, k = 7

a = [7]

Possible subarrays:

- [7]: sum = 7

- Empty subarray: sum = 0

The best is to choose the entire array [7] with sum 7 and insert it each time.

After 7 operations, the array would be [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], with sum 56.

But according to the sample input, the output is 896, which suggests that perhaps I can choose to insert larger sums.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I can choose to insert the sum multiple times in a single operation.

But the problem says "select any contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array."

So, in each operation, I select a contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert that sum into the array at any position.

I need to perform exactly K such operations.

In the second example, with n=3 and k=3, the sum after 3 operations is 96, which matches the sample output.

In the third example, with n=1 and k=7, starting with [7], after 7 operations, the sum is 56, but the sample output is 896, which is 56 * 16, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the operations.

Wait, perhaps in each operation, I can insert the sum multiple times.

But the problem says "insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array."

So, in each operation, I can choose a subarray, compute its sum, and insert that sum once into the array.

So, in the second example, with n=3 and k=3, starting with [2,2,8], sum=12.

After first operation: insert 12, say at the end: [2,2,8,12], sum=24

Second operation: choose [2,2,8,12], sum=24, insert at end: [2,2,8,12,24], sum=48

Third operation: choose [2,2,8,12,24], sum=48, insert at end: [2,2,8,12,24,48], sum=96

Which matches the sample output of 96.

But in the third test case, with n=1 and k=7, starting with [7], after 7 operations, inserting 7 each time, sum would be 7*(1+7)=56, but the sample output is 896.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, 7*(1+7)=7*8=56, but the sample output is 896, which is not matching.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after each insertion, the new sum can be used in the next operation.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the sum of the entire array in each operation, which includes the sums inserted in previous operations.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I have [7], sum=7.

Operation 1: choose [7], sum=7, insert 7: [7,7], sum=14

Operation 2: choose [7,7], sum=14, insert 14: [7,7,14], sum=28

Operation 3: choose [7,7,14], sum=28, insert 28: [7,7,14,28], sum=56

Operation 4: choose [7,7,14,28], sum=56, insert 56: [7,7,14,28,56], sum=112

Operation 5: choose [7,7,14,28,56], sum=112, insert 112: [7,7,14,28,56,112], sum=224

Operation 6: choose [7,7,14,28,56,112], sum=224, insert 224: [7,7,14,28,56,112,224], sum=448

Operation 7: choose [7,7,14,28,56,112,224], sum=448, insert 448: [7,7,14,28,56,112,224,448], sum=896

Ah, so the sum doubles approximately each time.

Starting with sum S, after inserting S, the new sum is S + S = 2S.

But in reality, it's S + (sum of the subarray), and the sum of the subarray can be up to S.

Wait, in the first operation, S=7, insert 7, new sum=14.

Second operation, S=14, insert 14, new sum=28.

Third operation, S=28, insert 28, new sum=56.

And so on, doubling each time.

So, after K operations, the sum is S * (2^K).

But in the sample input, with K=7, sum=7*128=896, which matches the sample output.

Wait, 7*128=896, yes.

So, it seems that by always choosing the entire array and inserting its sum, the sum doubles approximately each time.

Wait, but 7*128=896, but 7*128=896, yes.

So, generalizing, if I always choose the entire array and insert its sum, then in each operation, the sum of the array doubles.

Wait, but in the first operation, sum goes from S to 2S, then to 4S, then to 8S, and so on, up to 2^K * S.

But in the first test case, with S=-11, after two operations, it becomes -11 * 4 = -44, but the sample output is 999999996, which is -44 modulo 10^9 + 7.

Wait, but in the first test case, with n=2 and k=2, a=[-4,-7], sum=-11.

After first operation: choose empty subarray, sum=0, insert 0: [-4,-7,0], sum=-11

After second operation: choose empty subarray, sum=0, insert 0: [-4,-7,0,0], sum=-11

So, sum remains -11, which modulo 10^9 + 7 is 999999996.

But according to the doubling pattern, it should have been -44.

So, in this case, choosing the empty subarray is better because choosing the entire array would lead to a smaller sum (-11*4=-44, which is worse than -11).

Hence, the strategy should be to choose the subarray with the maximum sum in each operation and insert it.

But in the first test case, the maximum sum subarray is the empty subarray with sum 0, so inserting 0 is better than inserting a negative sum.

In the second test case, the maximum sum subarray is the entire array, with sum 12, and inserting it leads to doubling the sum each time.

So, generalizing, in each operation, I should choose the maximum sum subarray and insert its sum.

The maximum sum subarray is the one with the largest possible sum among all possible contiguous subarrays.

To find the maximum sum subarray, I can use the Kadane's algorithm, which runs in O(N) time.

Once I have the maximum sum subarray, say with sum M, then in each operation, I can insert M into the array, which increases the total sum by M.

But wait, in the second test case, inserting the entire array's sum leads to doubling the sum each time, which is better than just adding M each time.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. In the second test case, by inserting the sum of the entire array, which is 12, the new sum becomes S + M = 12 + 12 = 24.

But in the next operation, the sum of the array is now 24, and inserting 24 makes the new sum 24 + 24 = 48, and so on.

So, it's exponentially increasing the sum by choosing the entire array each time.

But if I just choose the maximum sum subarray each time and insert it, it would be adding M each time, which would be linear growth.

But in the second test case, exponential growth is achieved by choosing the entire array each time and inserting its sum.

Wait, but choosing the entire array's sum and inserting it effectively doubles the sum each time, because you're adding the current sum to itself.

Wait, more precisely, the new sum is S + S = 2S.

Wait, but in reality, when you insert S, you're adding S to the array, so the new sum is S + S = 2S.

Hence, after K operations, the sum becomes S * 2^K.

But in the first test case, S=-11, and -11 * 4 = -44, but choosing to insert 0 in each operation keeps the sum at -11, which is better than -44.

Hence, the strategy should be:

- If S >= 0, then choose to insert S each time, leading to sum S * 2^K.

- If S < 0, then choose to insert 0 each time, leading to sum S + 0*K = S.

Wait, but in the first test case, S=-11, and choosing to insert 0 each time keeps the sum at -11, which is better than choosing to insert S=-11 each time, which would lead to sum S * 2^K = -11 * 2^2 = -44, which is worse.

Hence, when S >= 0, choose to insert S each time.

When S < 0, choose to insert 0 each time.

But in some cases, there might be a subarray with a sum greater than S.

Wait, for example, in the array [4, -2, 8, -12, 9], the sum S=4 -2 +8 -12 +9=7.

But the maximum sum subarray is [4, -2, 8] with sum 10.

If I choose this subarray and insert its sum=10, then the new array becomes [4, -2, 8, -12, 9, 10], with sum=17.

If I choose to insert S=7, the new sum would be 14, which is less than 17.

Hence, in this case, choosing the maximum sum subarray to insert leads to a higher sum than choosing to insert S each time.

Hence, perhaps the general strategy is to choose the maximum sum subarray in each operation and insert its sum.

This way, if the maximum sum subarray has sum M, then in each operation, we add M to the sum.

Hence, the total sum after K operations would be S + K*M.

But in the second test case, choosing M=S leads to S + K*S = S*(K+1), which is less than choosing to insert S each time and doubling the sum.

Wait, but in that case, inserting S each time doubles the sum, which is better than adding M each time.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider both strategies and choose the better one.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is:

- If S >= 0, choose to insert S each time, leading to sum S * 2^K.

- If S < 0, choose to insert M each time, where M is the maximum sum subarray.

But in the first test case, S=-11, M=0, so choosing to insert 0 each time leads to sum S + K*0 = S, which is better than choosing to insert S each time, which would be S * 2^K.

In the fourth test case, n=5, k=1, a=[4,-2,8,-12,9], S=7, M=10.

If I choose to insert M=10 once, the new sum is 7 + 10 = 17.

If I choose to insert S=7 once, the new sum is 7 + 7 = 14, which is less than 17.

Hence, choosing M is better.

In the second test case, S=12, M=12, choosing to insert S each time leads to exponential growth, which is better than choosing M each time and adding linearly.

Wait, but in the second test case, choosing M=S=12 and inserting it each time leads to sum S + K*M = 12 + 3*12 = 48, but by choosing to insert S each time and doubling, we get 12 * 2^3 = 96, which is better.

Hence, choosing to insert S each time and doubling is better than choosing to insert M each time and adding linearly.

Hence, perhaps the strategy should be:

- If S >= 0, choose to insert S each time, leading to sum S * 2^K.

- If S < 0, choose to insert M each time, where M is the maximum sum subarray.

But in the fourth test case, S=7, M=10, choosing to insert M once gives sum 17, which is better than choosing to insert S=7, which would give sum 14.

But according to the strategy above, since S >= 0, I should choose to insert S each time, leading to sum S * 2^K = 7 * 2^1 = 14, which is less than 17.

Hence, perhaps the strategy needs to be adjusted.

Perhaps, when S >= 0, it's better to choose between inserting S each time (leading to S * 2^K) or inserting M each time (leading to S + K*M), and pick the one that gives the maximum sum.

In the fourth test case, S=7, M=10, K=1.

Option 1: Insert S once, sum = 14

Option 2: Insert M once, sum = 17

So, choosing to insert M is better.

In the second test case, S=12, M=12, K=3.

Option 1: Insert S each time, sum = 12 * 2^3 = 96

Option 2: Insert M each time, sum = 12 + 3*12 = 48

Hence, inserting S each time is better.

Another example: n=1, k=7, a=[7], S=7, M=7

Option 1: Insert S each time, sum = 7 * 2^7 = 896

Option 2: Insert M each time, sum = 7 + 7*7 = 56

Hence, inserting S each time is better.

Another example: n=2, k=2, a=[-4,-7], S=-11, M=0

Option 1: Insert S each time, sum = -11 * 2^2 = -44

Option 2: Insert M each time, sum = -11 + 2*0 = -11

Hence, inserting M is better.

Hence, the general strategy should be:

- Compute S, the initial sum of the array.

- Compute M, the maximum sum of any subarray (which can be zero if all elements are negative).

- If S >= 0, choose between:

- Option 1: Insert S each time, leading to sum S * 2^K

- Option 2: Insert M each time, leading to sum S + K*M

- Pick the maximum of these two.

- If S < 0, choose between:

- Option 1: Insert S each time, leading to sum S * 2^K

- Option 2: Insert M each time, leading to sum S + K*M

- But in this case, since S < 0, inserting S each time makes the sum worse, so it's better to insert M each time.

- However, if M >= S, then inserting M each time is better.

- But in the first test case, S=-11, M=0, inserting M each time keeps the sum at S + K*0 = S, which is better than S * 2^K = -44.

Hence, the strategy should be:

- Compute S, the initial sum of the array.

- Compute M, the maximum sum of any subarray.

- If S >= 0:

- Choose the maximum between S * 2^K and S + K*M.

- If S < 0:

- Choose the maximum between S * 2^K and S + K*M.

- But in practice, when S < 0 and M >= 0, inserting M each time is better.

- When S < 0 and M < 0, inserting M each time makes the sum worse, but it's still better than inserting S each time if M > S.

Wait, if S < 0 and M < 0, then inserting M each time makes the sum worse, but inserting S each time also makes the sum worse.

In such cases, it's better to insert M each time if M > S, otherwise insert S each time.

But in reality, M is the maximum sum subarray, so M is at least the maximum element in the array.

If all elements are negative, M is the maximum single element.

If there are positive elements, M is the maximum sum of a subarray.

Hence, in all cases, M >= maximum element in the array.

Hence, the strategy should be:

- Compute S, the initial sum of the array.

- Compute M, the maximum sum of any subarray.

- Choose the maximum between:

- S * 2^K

- S + K*M

- And pick the maximum of these two.

Then, take the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

But in the fourth test case, S=7, M=10, K=1.

Option 1: 7 * 2^1 = 14

Option 2: 7 + 1*10 = 17

Hence, choose 17.

In the second test case, S=12, M=12, K=3.

Option 1: 12 * 8 = 96

Option 2: 12 + 3*12 = 48

Hence, choose 96.

In the first test case, S=-11, M=0, K=2.

Option 1: -11 * 4 = -44

Option 2: -11 + 2*0 = -11

Hence, choose -11.

In the third test case, S=7, K=7.

Option 1: 7 * 128 = 896

Option 2: 7 + 7*7 = 56

Hence, choose 896.

This seems consistent with the sample outputs.

Hence, I can implement this strategy.

Now, I need to compute S and M efficiently.

S is simply the sum of the array, which is O(N).

M is the maximum sum subarray, which can be found using Kadane's algorithm in O(N).

Then, compute the two options and choose the maximum.

Finally, take modulo 10^9 + 7.

Edge cases to consider:

- N=1, K=0: but K is at least 1 according to constraints.

- All elements are negative.

- All elements are non-negative.

- M > S

- M < S

- M = S

Implementing this in code should be straightforward.

Hence, the given program seems to be implementing this logic.

In the program:

- It reads T test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads N and K.

- Reads the array A.

- Computes S = sum(A).

- Computes M = maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.

- Computes two options:

- Option 1: S * 2^K

- Option 2: S + K*M

- Chooses the maximum of these two.

- Takes modulo 10^9 + 7.

- Prints the result.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{True}}
