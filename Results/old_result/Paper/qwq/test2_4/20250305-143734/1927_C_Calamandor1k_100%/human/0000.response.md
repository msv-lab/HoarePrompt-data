Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two arrays, a and b, with lengths n and m respectively, and there's an even number k. I need to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to k are included among the chosen elements.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. The arrays a and b can have duplicates, since the elements are integers between 1 and 10^6, but k is up to 2*min(n,m), and k is even. The task is to select k/2 elements from each array, and the union of these selected elements should cover all numbers from 1 to k.

So, for example, in the first sample input:

n=6, m=5, k=6

a = [2,3,8,5,6,5]

b = [1,3,4,10,5]

I need to choose 3 elements from a and 3 from b such that all numbers from 1 to 6 are covered. In this case, it's possible: choose 2,3,6 from a and 1,4,5 from b.

In the second sample input:

n=6, m=5, k=6

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5]

b = [1,3,8,10,3]

It's not possible to choose 3 from each such that all from 1 to 6 are covered. Seems like 1 is only in b, but choosing 1 from b, and then need to choose 2,3,4,5,6 from the remaining choices, but there are constraints on how many to choose from each array.

So, my approach should be to look at the unique elements in each array that are within the range 1 to k, and see if it's possible to cover all k numbers by selecting k/2 from each array.

Let me think about the sets involved. Let's define:

- relevant_a: elements in a that are between 1 and k, inclusive.

- relevant_b: elements in b that are between 1 and k, inclusive.

I need to choose k/2 elements from relevant_a and k/2 from relevant_b such that their union covers all k numbers.

To think about it differently, some numbers might only be present in a, some only in b, and some in both. I need to make sure that all numbers are covered, and I can't choose more than k/2 elements from each array.

Let me define:

- only_a: numbers that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b.

- only_b: numbers that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a.

- both: numbers that are in both relevant_a and relevant_b.

Now, for the selection:

- I must choose all elements from only_a, because if a number is only in a, I have to choose it from a.

- Similarly, I must choose all elements from only_b from b.

- For the numbers in both, I can choose them from either array.

The problem arises if the number of elements that must be chosen from a or b exceeds k/2.

So, let's formalize this:

- Letâ€™s say len(only_a) is the number of elements that must be chosen from a.

- Similarly, len(only_b) is the number of elements that must be chosen from b.

- Then, the remaining choices from a and b would be up to k/2 - len(only_a) from a and k/2 - len(only_b) from b.

- The intersection (both) needs to be covered by these remaining choices.

But wait, I need to make sure that the total number of choices from a and b are exactly k/2 each.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that:

- The number of elements that must be chosen from a (only_a) does not exceed k/2.

- Similarly, the number of elements that must be chosen from b (only_b) does not exceed k/2.

- And the total number of unique elements (only_a + only_b + both) should be at least k.

But actually, in the first sample input, only_a could be {2,6}, only_b could be {1,4}, and both could be {3,5}. So, len(only_a)=2, len(only_b)=2, len(both)=2. Total unique is 6, which is k.

We need to choose 3 from a and 3 from b.

So, from a: choose 2,3,6 (2 from only_a and 1 from both).

From b: choose 1,4,5 (2 from only_b and 1 from both).

This works.

In the second sample input:

only_a could be {2,4,6}, only_b could be {1,8,10}, both could be {3,5}.

But wait, k=6, so only numbers up to 6 are considered.

So, relevant_b would be {1,3,4,5}, since 10 is greater than k=6.

So, only_b would be {1}, both would be {3,4,5}, and only_a would be {2,6}.

Wait, but in a, a=[2,3,4,5,6,5], so relevant_a is {2,3,4,5,6}.

relevant_b is {1,3,4,5}.

So, only_a is {2,6}, only_b is {1}, both is {3,4,5}.

Now, I need to choose 3 from a and 3 from b.

Must choose 2,6 from a, and 1 from b.

Then, from both, I need to choose 3-2=1 from a and 3-1=2 from b.

But both has {3,4,5}, so choose 1 from a and 2 from b.

This would cover all numbers.

But according to the problem, it's not possible. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in the problem, it says it's not possible, but according to this, it seems possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the problem statement.

Oh, in the second sample input, a=[2,3,4,5,6,5], b=[1,3,8,10,3], k=6.

Wait, b has 8 and 10, which are greater than k=6, so relevant_b is {1,3}.

Wait, b=[1,3,8,10,3], so relevant_b is {1,3}.

a=[2,3,4,5,6,5], relevant_a is {2,3,4,5,6}.

So, only_a is {2,4,5,6}, only_b is {1}, both is {3}.

Wait, no: only_a are elements in a but not in b, so only_a is {2,4,5,6}, only_b is {1}, both is {3}.

Now, I need to choose k/2=3 elements from a and 3 from b.

Must choose all only_a and only_b, but only_a has 4 elements, which is more than k/2=3. So, it's impossible to choose all only_a since len(only_a)=4 > 3.

Hence, "NO".

I see. So, the condition should be:

- If len(only_a) > k/2, then "NO", because we can't choose more than k/2 from a.

- Similarly, if len(only_b) > k/2, then "NO".

- Also, the total unique relevant elements should be at least k.

- And, the number of elements in both should be sufficient to fill the remaining choices after choosing all only_a and only_b.

Wait, but in the previous step, if len(only_a) > k/2 or len(only_b) > k/2, it's already "NO".

Otherwise, if total unique is less than k, it's "NO".

Otherwise, it's "YES".

Is that sufficient?

In the first sample, only_a={2,6}, only_b={1,4}, both={3,5}.

len(only_a)=2 <=3, len(only_b)=2 <=3, total unique=6 >=k=6, so "YES".

In the second sample, only_a={2,4,6}, only_b={1}, both={3,5}.

Wait, according to earlier, only_a={2,4,5,6}, which has len=4 >3, so "NO".

Seems correct.

Another sample input:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a=[1,3,5]

b=[2,4,6]

only_a={1,5}, only_b={2,6}, both={4}

len(only_a)=2 <=3, len(only_b)=2 <=3, total unique=5 >=k=4, so "YES".

But wait, total unique is 1,2,3,4,5,6, which is 6 >=4, but do I need exactly k=4?

Wait, the problem says "every integer from 1 to k is included", but doesn't specify that only those are chosen.

But in this case, choosing 1,3 from a and 2,4 from b would cover 1,2,3,4.

So, "YES".

Another sample:

n=2, m=5, k=4

a=[1,4]

b=[7,3,4,4,2]

only_a={1}, only_b={7,3,2}, both={4}

len(only_a)=1 <=2, len(only_b)=3 >2, so "NO".

Correct, as per the sample output.

Another sample:

n=1, m=4, k=2

a=[6]

b=[4,2,4,2]

only_a={6}, only_b={2,4}, both={}

len(only_a)=1 <=1, len(only_b)=2 >1, so "NO".

Correct, as per the sample output.

Last sample:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a=[1,4,2]

b=[2,4,3]

only_a={1}, only_b={3}, both={2,4}

len(only_a)=1 <=2, len(only_b)=1 <=2, total unique=1,2,3,4 >=4, so "YES".

So, seems this condition works.

Hence, in the code, we can compute only_a, only_b, both from relevant_a and relevant_b, and check the conditions:

- len(only_a) <= k/2

- len(only_b) <= k/2

- len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both) >= k

If all these are satisfied, then "YES", else "NO".

Also, need to make sure that k is even, but it's given in the problem.

Edge cases to consider:

- k=2, n=1, m=1

- a=[1], b=[2]: "YES"

- a=[1], b=[1]: "NO", because only_a={} , only_b={}, both={1}, but need to choose 1 from each array, but both are choosing the same number, which is allowed, but do we need distinct choices? The problem says "choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays", not necessarily distinct choices.

Wait, but in this case, choosing 1 from a and 1 from b would cover 1, which is less than k=2.

So, "NO".

Another edge case:

n=2, m=2, k=2

a=[1,2]

b=[1,2]

only_a={}, only_b={}, both={1,2}

Need to choose 1 from a and 1 from b.

Choose 1 from a and 2 from b: covers 1 and 2: "YES"

Choose 2 from a and 1 from b: covers 1 and 2: "YES"

Choose 1 from a and 1 from b: covers only 1: "NO"

Wait, but the choice must be exactly k/2 from each, and the elements are chosen, not necessarily their indices.

So, in this case, since a has [1,2], b has [1,2], choosing {1,2} from a and {1} from b, but we can only choose one from each.

Wait, k=2, k/2=1, so choose 1 from a and 1 from b.

If choose 1 from a and 1 from b: covers only 1.

If choose 1 from a and 2 from b: covers 1 and 2.

So, it's possible.

Hence, "YES".

Another edge case:

n=2, m=2, k=4

a=[1,3]

b=[2,4]

only_a={1,3}, only_b={2,4}, both={}

len(only_a)=2 <=1 (k/2=2), len(only_b)=2 <=1: no, len(only_b)=2 >1, so "NO".

Wait, k=4, k/2=2.

Wait, n=2, m=2, k=4.

But min(n,m)=2, k=4 is allowed.

So, only_a={1,3}, only_b={2,4}, both={}

len(only_a)=2 <=2, len(only_b)=2 <=2, total unique=4 >=4, so "YES".

But in this case, choosing both from a and both from b would cover all 4.

Hence, "YES".

Wait, but k=4, and k/2=2, so choose 2 from a and 2 from b.

Choose 1 and 3 from a, and 2 and 4 from b: covers all 4: "YES".

Another edge case:

n=3, m=3, k=6

a=[1,2,3]

b=[4,5,6]

only_a={1,2,3}, only_b={4,5,6}, both={}

len(only_a)=3 <=3, len(only_b)=3 <=3, total unique=6 >=6: "YES".

Another edge case:

n=1, m=1, k=2

a=[1]

b=[1]

only_a={}, only_b={}, both={1}

len(only_a)=0 <=1, len(only_b)=0 <=1, total unique=1 <2: "NO".

Correct.

Seems the condition holds.

Now, looking at the given code:

def func_1(t, cases):

results = []

for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:

unique_a = set(a)

unique_b = set(b)

relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}

relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}

only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b

only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a

both = relevant_a & relevant_b

if len(only_a) > k // 2:

results.append('NO')

continue

if len(only_b) > k // 2:

results.append('NO')

continue

total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)

if total_distinct < k:

results.append('NO')

continue

results.append('YES')

return results

This seems to implement exactly the logic I described.

It first computes unique elements in a and b that are <=k.

Then, computes only_a, only_b, and both.

Then checks if len(only_a) > k/2 or len(only_b) > k/2, or if total unique <k, then "NO", else "YES".

This should be correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Correctness: True}}
