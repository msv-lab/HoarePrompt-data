Alright, I've got this problem to figure out. It's about a game on a checkered board where Alice and Bob are moving their chips according to specific rules, and I need to determine who wins if both play optimally. The board has h rows and w columns, and each player starts at certain positions. Alice moves down or diagonally down, while Bob moves up or diagonally up. The goal for each is to land on the opponent's chip to win, and if neither can move, it's a draw.

First, I need to understand the movement rules clearly. Alice can move:

- Down: (x_a + 1, y_a)

- Down-right: (x_a + 1, y_a + 1)

- Down-left: (x_a + 1, y_a - 1)

Bob can move:

- Up: (x_b - 1, y_b)

- Up-right: (x_b - 1, y_b + 1)

- Up-left: (x_b - 1, y_b - 1)

They can't move off the board, so their moves are constrained by the board's dimensions.

The game ends in three possible ways:

1. Alice wins by landing on Bob's position.

2. Bob wins by landing on Alice's position.

3. It's a draw if neither can make a move when it's their turn.

I need to determine the outcome based on the initial positions and the board size, assuming both play optimally.

Let me think about the game mechanics. Since Alice moves first, and they alternate turns, the sequence of moves is Alice, Bob, Alice, Bob, and so on.

I should consider the relative positions of Alice and Bob. Specifically, their row differences and column differences.

Let's define:

- Row difference: d_x = x_b - x_a

- Column difference: d_y = y_b - y_a

Given that Alice moves down and Bob moves up, their row difference will change over time.

If Alice is below Bob (x_a > x_b), but according to the problem, since Alice moves down and Bob moves up, and Alice starts at (x_a, y_a), Bob at (x_b, y_b), with x_a and x_b ranging from 1 to h.

Wait, in the problem, it's mentioned that rows are numbered from top to bottom, so row 1 is the top row, and row h is the bottom row.

So, Alice moves down, increasing her row number, while Bob moves up, decreasing his row number.

Therefore, if Alice is in a lower row (higher x_a) than Bob (lower x_a), she's moving towards higher row numbers, and Bob is moving towards lower row numbers. So, if Alice is already below Bob, she can't catch up unless Bob moves to a lower row, but Bob is moving up, so this needs careful consideration.

Wait, no. If Alice is at a lower row (higher x_a) and moves down, she's moving further away from Bob, who is moving up towards the top.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of moves each can make.

Alice can make moves until she reaches row h, and Bob can make moves until he reaches row 1.

If Alice reaches row h, she can't move anymore, and similarly, if Bob reaches row 1, he can't move.

So, the game ends in a draw if neither can win before reaching their respective boundaries.

I need to find a way to determine if Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position, considering their movements.

Let me consider the minimal number of moves Alice needs to reach Bob's position.

Alice can move down by 1 row per move, and can adjust her column by -1, 0, or +1 per move.

Similarly, Bob can move up by 1 row per move, and can adjust his column by -1, 0, or +1 per move.

So, in terms of rows, the difference d_x = x_b - x_a decreases by at least 2 per two moves (one by Alice and one by Bob), because Alice increases x_a by 1 and Bob decreases x_b by 1.

Wait, no. Alice increases x_a by 1 per move, and Bob decreases x_b by 1 per move.

So, the row difference d_x decreases by 2 every two moves.

Similarly, the column difference d_y can change by up to 2 per two moves, since Alice can move column by -1, 0, or +1, and Bob can move column by -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but they move in alternate turns, so in two moves (one by Alice and one by Bob), the column difference can change by up to 2 (if Alice moves +1 and Bob moves -1, or vice versa).

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe I need a better approach.

I recall that in game theory, such games can be analyzed using the concept of game states and who can force a win.

Perhaps I can model this as a game where the state is determined by the positions of Alice and Bob, and the player to move makes a decision based on available moves.

But with large h and w (up to 10^6 and 10^9 respectively), I need an efficient way to compute the outcome.

Let me consider the relative positions.

Let me define:

- d_x = x_b - x_a (initial row difference)

- d_y = y_b - y_a (initial column difference)

Assuming d_x > 0 (since Alice is below Bob initially, as x_a < x_b).

If d_x is even, then the number of combined moves (Alice and Bob moves) to close the row difference could be calculated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of moves for Alice to reach Bob's position, and similarly for Bob to reach Alice's position.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider that Alice wants to minimize the row difference and adjust the column difference to land on Bob's position, while Bob wants to do the opposite.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of who can reach the other's position first.

But I need a more structured approach.

I found that in such pursuit-evasion games, the key is to see if one player can catch up to the other before they reach their boundaries.

In this case, Alice is trying to catch Bob before she reaches the bottom row, and Bob is trying to catch Alice before he reaches the top row.

Let me consider the row difference d_x = x_b - x_a.

Each turn consists of Alice moving down by 1 row and Bob moving up by 1 row, so the row difference decreases by 2 per turn.

So, the number of turns before they meet in rows is d_x // 2, assuming d_x is even.

If d_x is odd, then after (d_x - 1) // 2 turns, Alice will be at row x_a + (d_x - 1)//2, and Bob at x_b - (d_x - 1)//2.

Then, in the next move, Alice moves again, increasing her row by 1, possibly overshooting Bob's row.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I should consider the parity of d_x.

Case 1: d_x is even.

Then, after d_x / 2 turns, both Alice and Bob would have moved d_x / 2 steps towards each other.

Alice's position: (x_a + d_x / 2, y_a + some column adjustment)

Bob's position: (x_b - d_x / 2, y_b + some column adjustment)

If at this point, their positions coincide, then Alice wins.

But I need to see if Alice can adjust her column to match Bob's column.

Similarly, Bob tries to adjust his column to match Alice's column.

This seems complex.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of moves for Alice to reach Bob's position, considering both row and column differences.

Similarly for Bob to reach Alice's position.

But with large board sizes, this needs to be efficient.

Let me consider that Alice needs to cover d_x rows to reach Bob's initial row, and adjust her column by d_y.

Each move, she can adjust her column by -1, 0, or +1, while moving down by 1 row.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column by -1, 0, or +1 while moving up by 1 row per move.

So, in terms of column difference, per two moves (one by Alice and one by Bob), the column difference can change by up to 2 (if Alice moves +1 and Bob moves -1, or vice versa).

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a single entity moving on the board, but it's getting too complicated.

I recall that in some games, the outcome depends on who has the initiative, i.e., who can force the other into a losing position.

In this case, Alice moves first, so she has the first move.

I need to see if Alice can force a win, or if Bob can force a win, or if neither can and it's a draw.

Let me consider some base cases.

Base case 1: Alice and Bob are already on the same cell initially.

But the problem states that initial positions are different, so this doesn't apply.

Base case 2: Alice is already in the last row (x_a = h). Then she can't move, so Bob can't be caught, and it's a draw.

Similarly, if Bob is in the first row (x_b = 1), he can't move, so Alice can't be caught, and it's a draw.

But in the problem, it's guaranteed that x_a < x_b, so Alice is above Bob initially.

Wait, no, it's not necessarily x_a < x_b. The problem says h rows numbered from 1 to h, top to bottom.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "the board has h rows, numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right."

So, row 1 is the top row, row h is the bottom row.

Alice moves down, increasing her row number, while Bob moves up, decreasing his row number.

Given that, if Alice is in row h, she can't move, and if Bob is in row 1, he can't move.

But the problem says "it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b", meaning they start at different positions.

I need to find a general strategy for any initial positions within the constraints.

Let me consider the relative movement.

Each turn consists of Alice moving down by 1 and adjusting her column by -1, 0, or +1, and then Bob moving up by 1 and adjusting his column by -1, 0, or +1.

So, in two moves (one by Alice and one by Bob), the row difference decreases by 2, and the column difference can change by -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2.

Wait, but it's not exactly two moves because Alice moves first, and if d_x is odd, the number of turns is different.

This seems too involved.

Perhaps I can look for patterns in the example test cases provided.

Looking back at the example input and output:

Input:

6 5 2 2 5 3 → Alice

4 1 2 1 4 1 → Bob

1 4 1 3 1 1 → Draw

5 5 1 4 5 2 → Draw

4 4 1 1 4 4 → Draw

10 10 1 6 10 8 → Alice

10 10 2 6 10 7 → Draw

10 10 9 1 8 1 → Draw

10 10 8 1 10 2 → Bob

10 10 1 1 2 1 → Alice

10 10 1 3 4 1 → Alice

10 10 3 1 1 1 → Draw

From these, I need to find a pattern or condition that determines the outcome.

Looking at the first test case:

h=6, w=5, Alice at (2,2), Bob at (5,3)

Alice can try to reach Bob's position before Bob reaches Alice's position.

Similarly, in the second test case:

h=4, w=1, Alice at (2,1), Bob at (4,1)

Here, Alice can only move down, and Bob can only move up. Since w=1, columns don't change.

So, Alice moves from row 2 to row 3, then Bob moves from row 4 to row 3.

Now, both are in row 3, and since w=1, columns are the same.

So, Alice is at (3,1), Bob at (3,1), but since they are in the same cell, Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the output, it's "Bob". Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the second test case, output is "Bob", but according to my reasoning, Alice wins.

Wait, maybe I need to look carefully.

Wait, in this setup:

h=4, w=1

Alice starts at (2,1), Bob at (4,1)

Alice moves first:

- Moves from (2,1) to (3,1)

- Bob moves from (4,1) to (3,1)

Now, Bob is at (3,1), which is the same as Alice's position, so Bob wins.

Wait, but according to the problem, the player who lands on the opponent's position wins.

So, in this case, Bob lands on Alice's position, so Bob wins.

Hence, output is "Bob".

Got it.

Another test case:

h=1, w=4

Alice at (1,3), Bob at (1,1)

Alice can't move down since she's in row 1, so it's a draw.

Output is "Draw".

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case:

h=10, w=10

Alice at (1,6), Bob at (10,8)

Alice moves down to (2,6), Bob moves up to (9,8)

Continues until Alice reaches (10,6), but Bob is at (10,8).

Then Alice can try to adjust columns to reach Bob's position.

Need to see if Alice can adjust columns fast enough to match Bob's column before Bob can reach Alice's column.

This seems complex.

Perhaps I need to find a general formula based on row and column differences.

Let me consider the row difference d_x = x_b - x_a

Column difference d_y = y_b - y_a

If d_x is even:

- After d_x / 2 turns, both have moved d_x / 2 steps towards each other.

- Alice's position: (x_a + d_x / 2, y_a + some adjustment)

- Bob's position: (x_b - d_x / 2, y_b + some adjustment)

If d_x is odd:

- After (d_x - 1) / 2 turns, Alice moves one more step.

- Alice's position: (x_a + (d_x + 1) / 2, y_a + some adjustment)

- Bob's position: (x_b - (d_x - 1) / 2, y_b + some adjustment)

This seems too involved.

I need a better way.

I recall that in such games, the outcome often depends on whether the players can meet in a certain number of moves.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the time it takes for Alice to reach Bob's row and see if she can adjust her column to match Bob's column within that time.

Similarly for Bob to reach Alice's row.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s define:

- d_x = x_b - x_a (row difference, positive if Bob is below Alice)

- d_y = y_b - y_a (column difference)

If d_x is even:

- Number of full turns: t = d_x / 2

- After t turns, Alice is at (x_a + t, y_a + a), where a is the column adjustment she made (a ∈ [-t, t])

- Bob is at (x_b - t, y_b + b), where b is the column adjustment he made (b ∈ [-t, t])

- For Alice to win, she needs to have y_a + a = y_b + b, i.e., a - b = d_y

- Since a and b are both in [-t, t], a - b ∈ [-2t, 2t]

- So, if d_y ∈ [-2t, 2t], Alice can choose a and b accordingly to make a - b = d_y

- Similarly, Bob can try to make y_b + b = y_a + a, which is the same condition.

Wait, this seems overlapping.

Perhaps I need to consider who moves first and how the adjustments interact.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider that Alice moves first, and she can choose her column adjustments to minimize the column difference with Bob.

Similarly, Bob tries to maximize or minimize it depending on his goal.

This seems like a zero-sum game.

I need to find a way to determine who can force a win.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of steps required to eliminate the row difference and see if the column difference can be eliminated within that time.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the minimal number of steps for Alice to reach Bob's row and see if she can adjust her column to match Bob's column within those steps.

Similarly for Bob.

Let’s try to formalize this.

For Alice to reach Bob's row:

- She needs to move down d_x steps.

- During these d_x steps, she can adjust her column by up to d_x steps in either direction.

- So, her column can be y_a + k, where -d_x <= k <= d_x

Similarly, Bob can move up d_x steps and adjust his column by up to d_x steps in either direction.

Wait, but they move alternately.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each move Alice makes down, Bob makes a move up.

So, for every two moves (one by Alice and one by Bob), the row difference decreases by 2.

Hence, the number of such combined moves is ceil(d_x / 2).

Wait, no.

If d_x is even, then number of combined moves is d_x / 2.

If d_x is odd, then number of combined moves is (d_x - 1) / 2, and Alice makes one more move.

In each combined move, Alice can adjust her column by up to 1 in either direction, and Bob can do the same.

So, in t combined moves, Alice can adjust her column by up to t in either direction, and Bob can adjust his column by up to t in either direction.

Therefore, the column difference d_y can be adjusted by up to 2t in combined moves.

Wait, but they adjust their columns independently.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the relative column adjustment.

In t combined moves, the relative column adjustment between Alice and Bob can be up to 2t.

Wait, no.

Alice can adjust her column by up to t steps (since she moves t times), and Bob can adjust his column by up to t steps.

So, the difference in their column positions can change by up to 2t.

Hence, if |d_y| <= 2t, then Alice can adjust her column to match Bob's column after t combined moves.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column to match Alice's column.

But this seems overlapping.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider who has the last move.

If d_x is even, then after t = d_x / 2 combined moves, both have moved t steps.

If d_x is odd, then Alice moves t = (d_x + 1) / 2 steps, and Bob moves t = (d_x - 1) / 2 steps.

In this case, Alice has the last move.

So, perhaps I need to consider the parity of d_x.

Let me consider d_x even and d_x odd separately.

Case 1: d_x is even.

Then, after t = d_x / 2 combined moves, both are at row x_a + t = x_b - t.

At this point, if Alice can make her column equal to Bob's column, she wins.

Similarly, if Bob can make his column equal to Alice's column, he wins.

But since they both can adjust their columns independently, and the relative column difference can be adjusted by up to 2t, I need to see if |d_y| <= 2t.

But t = d_x / 2.

So, |d_y| <= d_x.

If this is true, then Alice can adjust her column to match Bob's column, and similarly, Bob can adjust his column to match Alice's column.

But since Alice moves first, she can choose to match Bob's column if |d_y| <= d_x.

Similarly, Bob can choose to match Alice's column.

But I need to see who can force a win.

Wait, perhaps if |d_y| <= d_x and d_x is even, then Alice can win.

Wait, but in the example test case where h=6, w=5, x_a=2, y_a=2, x_b=5, y_b=3, d_x=3, which is odd.

Wait, in this case, d_x=3 is odd.

Wait, in that test case, output is "Alice".

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that Alice can win if she can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position.

Similarly, Bob can win if he can reach Alice's position before Alice can reach his position.

Otherwise, it's a draw.

To formalize this, I need to calculate the minimal number of moves for Alice to reach Bob's position and for Bob to reach Alice's position.

If Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position, then Alice wins.

Similarly, if Bob can reach Alice's position before Alice can reach Bob's position, then Bob wins.

Otherwise, it's a draw.

But calculating the minimal number of moves for each seems complex.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that Alice is trying to minimize the distance to Bob, while Bob is trying to maximize the distance from Alice.

Wait, but Bob is moving towards Alice as well.

This seems like a game of pursuit-evasion.

I recall that in such games, the outcome depends on whether the pursuer can catch the evader within a certain number of moves.

In this case, both are trying to catch each other.

This seems symmetric, but with different movement directions.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the game from Alice's perspective.

Alice wants to minimize the number of moves to reach Bob's position, while Bob tries to maximize the number of moves Alice needs.

Similarly, Bob wants to minimize the number of moves to reach Alice's position, while Alice tries to maximize the number of moves Bob needs.

This is getting too involved.

Let me look for patterns in the example test cases.

Looking back at the example inputs and outputs:

Input:

6 5 2 2 5 3 → Alice

4 1 2 1 4 1 → Bob

1 4 1 3 1 1 → Draw

5 5 1 4 5 2 → Draw

4 4 1 1 4 4 → Draw

10 10 1 6 10 8 → Alice

10 10 2 6 10 7 → Draw

10 10 9 1 8 1 → Draw

10 10 8 1 10 2 → Bob

10 10 1 1 2 1 → Alice

10 10 1 3 4 1 → Alice

10 10 3 1 1 1 → Draw

Looking at these, perhaps when d_x is odd and y_a == y_b, Alice wins.

Wait, in the first test case, d_x=3 (odd), y_a=2, y_b=3, y_a != y_b, output is Alice.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps when d_x is odd, Alice can win, and when d_x is even, Bob can win.

But looking at the test cases, this doesn't hold.

For example, h=4, w=1, x_a=2, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=1, d_x=2 (even), output is Bob.

Wait, according to my assumption, if d_x is even, Bob wins, which matches the output.

Another test case: h=1, w=4, x_a=1, y_a=3, x_b=1, y_b=1, d_x=0 (even), output is Draw.

Another test case: h=5, w=5, x_a=1, y_a=4, x_b=5, y_b=2, d_x=4 (even), output is Draw.

Another test case: h=4, w=4, x_a=1, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=4, d_x=3 (odd), output is Draw.

Wait, this doesn't fit.

Wait, d_x=3 is odd, output is Draw.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, if d_x is odd, Alice wins, but in this test case, it's Draw.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps there's another condition.

Let me look for another pattern.

Suppose I consider the minimal number of moves for Alice to reach Bob's position.

Alice needs to cover d_x rows and adjust d_y columns.

Each move, she can adjust her column by up to 1.

So, the minimal number of moves for Alice to reach Bob's position is max(d_x, |d_y|).

Similarly, for Bob to reach Alice's position, he needs to cover d_x rows and adjust d_y columns.

But since they move alternately, I need to see who can reach the other's position first.

Wait, perhaps not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I need to see if Alice can reach Bob's position in fewer than or equal to t moves, where t is the number of moves Bob needs to reach Alice's position.

Similarly for Bob.

Let me formalize this.

Let t_a = max(d_x, |d_y|)

Let t_b = max(d_x, |d_y|)

Wait, but they have the same t_a and t_b.

Wait, no, actually, Alice needs to cover d_x rows and |d_y| columns, and Bob needs to cover d_x rows and |d_y| columns.

But Alice moves down and Bob moves up, so their movements are towards each other.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the combined movement.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that per two moves (one by Alice and one by Bob), the row difference decreases by 2, and the column difference can be adjusted by up to 2.

Hence, in t = d_x / 2 combined moves, the row difference is eliminated, and the column difference should be adjusted accordingly.

If d_x is even, then after t = d_x / 2 combined moves, both are at the same row.

Similarly, if d_x is odd, after t = (d_x - 1) / 2 combined moves, Alice makes one more move to reach Bob's row.

Then, I need to see if the column difference can be adjusted within these moves.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Case 1: d_x is even.

After t = d_x / 2 combined moves, both are at row x_a + t.

Alice can adjust her column by up to t steps (since she moves t times), and Bob can adjust his column by up to t steps.

Hence, the column difference d_y can be adjusted by up to 2t.

So, if |d_y| <= 2t, then Alice can win by adjusting her column to match Bob's column.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column to match Alice's column.

But since Alice moves first, she has the initiative.

Hence, if |d_y| <= 2t, Alice can win.

Otherwise, it's a draw.

Wait, but in the example test cases, this doesn't hold.

Wait, for example, h=4, w=1, x_a=2, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=1.

Here, d_x=2, t=1, |d_y|=0 <= 2*1, so Alice can win, but according to the output, it's "Bob".

This contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider who has the last move.

Wait, in this case, d_x=2 is even, so after t=1 combined move, both are at row x_a + t = 3.

Alice is at (3,1), Bob is at (3,1), so Bob wins.

Wait, but according to the problem, the player who lands on the opponent's position wins.

So, in this case, Bob lands on Alice's position, so Bob wins.

Hence, even if Alice can adjust to match Bob's column, Bob can also adjust to match Alice's column, but since Bob moves second, he can respond to Alice's move.

Hence, in this case, Bob wins.

So, perhaps when d_x is even, Bob can always win.

Similarly, when d_x is odd, Alice can win.

Looking back at the test cases:

- d_x=3 (odd), output= Alice

- d_x=2 (even), output= Bob

- d_x=0 (even), output= Draw

- d_x=4 (even), output= Draw

- d_x=9 (odd), output= Draw

- d_x=8 (even), output= Bob

- d_x=1 (odd), output= Alice

- d_x=3 (odd), output= Alice

- d_x=2 (even), output= Bob

- d_x=3 (odd), output= Alice

- d_x=2 (even), output= Draw

Wait, this seems inconsistent with the earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps when d_x is odd, Alice can win if she can adjust her column to match Bob's column within t = (d_x + 1)/2 moves.

Similarly, when d_x is even, Bob can win if he can adjust his column to match Alice's column within t = d_x / 2 moves.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider:

- If d_x is odd:

- Alice has the last move.

- She can adjust her column by up to t = (d_x + 1)/2 steps.

- So, if |d_y| <= t, Alice can win.

- Otherwise, it's a draw.

- If d_x is even:

- Bob has the last move.

- He can adjust his column by up to t = d_x / 2 steps.

- So, if |d_y| <= t, Bob can win.

- Otherwise, it's a draw.

But looking back at the test cases:

First test case:

d_x=3 (odd), |d_y|=1 <= 2, so Alice wins.

Second test case:

d_x=2 (even), |d_y|=0 <=1, so Bob wins.

Third test case:

d_x=0 (even), |d_y|=2 >0, but output is Draw.

Wait, according to my assumption, if d_x is even and |d_y| <= t, Bob wins.

Here, t = 0, |d_y|=2 >0, so it's a draw.

Wait, but d_x=0 is a special case where Alice is already in the same row as Bob.

But according to the problem, they start at different positions, so Alice can't win immediately.

Bob can't move if x_b=1, but here x_b=1 and x_a=1, but positions are different.

So, it's a draw.

Hence, my assumption seems to hold.

Another test case:

h=5, w=5, x_a=1, y_a=4, x_b=5, y_b=2, d_x=4 (even), |d_y|=2 <=2, so Bob wins.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there are additional constraints.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that both players must be able to reach the same position within their moves.

In the third test case, d_x=4, |d_y|=2 <=2 (t=2), so Bob can win.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the board boundaries.

Wait, in that test case, h=5, Alice starts at x_a=1, Bob at x_b=5.

Alice needs to move down 4 steps to reach x_b=5.

Bob needs to move up 4 steps to reach x_a=1.

But in this time, Alice can adjust her column by up to 4 steps, and Bob can adjust his column by up to 4 steps.

So, the column difference is 2, which is less than or equal to 4.

Hence, both can adjust their columns to match the other's column.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Wait, perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after Alice moves, Bob moves, and so on.

So, in the last move, Bob moves, and if he can land on Alice's position, he wins.

But in this case, since d_x is even, Bob has the last move, and he can adjust his column to match Alice's column.

Hence, Bob can win.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Wait, perhaps because Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob reaches Alice's position.

Wait, in this test case, Alice needs to cover d_x=4 rows and |d_y|=2 columns.

Alice moves down 4 rows, adjusting her column by up to 4 steps.

Similarly, Bob moves up 4 rows, adjusting his column by up to 4 steps.

But since Alice moves first, she can choose her path to reach Bob's position, and Bob can choose to avoid her.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that both players are trying to reach each other's positions, but with Alice moving first, she can force Bob into a position where he can't reach her in time.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

I recall that in some games, the outcome can be determined by the parity of the distance or the number of moves.

In this case, perhaps the parity of d_x determines who can force a win.

Looking back at the test cases:

- d_x odd: Alice wins

- d_x even: Bob wins or Draw

But in some even cases, it's a Draw.

Wait, perhaps when d_x is even and |d_y| <= d_x / 2, Bob can win.

Otherwise, it's a Draw.

Similarly, when d_x is odd and |d_y| <= (d_x + 1) / 2, Alice can win.

Otherwise, it's a Draw.

Looking back at the test cases:

First test case: d_x=3, |d_y|=1 <=2, Alice wins.

Second test case: d_x=2, |d_y|=0 <=1, Bob wins.

Third test case: d_x=0, |d_y|=2 >0, Draw.

Fourth test case: d_x=4, |d_y|=2 <=2, Bob wins.

Wait, but according to the output, it's Draw.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, perhaps when d_x is even, Bob can win only if |d_y| <= d_x / 2.

Otherwise, it's a Draw.

Similarly, when d_x is odd, Alice can win if |d_y| <= (d_x + 1) / 2.

Otherwise, it's a Draw.

Looking back at the test cases:

First test case: d_x=3, |d_y|=1 <=2, Alice wins.

Second test case: d_x=2, |d_y|=0 <=1, Bob wins.

Third test case: d_x=0, |d_y|=2 >0, Draw.

Fourth test case: d_x=4, |d_y|=2 <=2, Bob wins.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Wait, perhaps there's another condition related to the board size or the positions.

Wait, in the fourth test case, h=5, w=5, x_a=1, y_a=4, x_b=5, y_b=2.

d_x=4, |d_y|=2 <=2, so Bob wins.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to consider that if d_x is even and |d_y| <= d_x / 2, Bob can win.

Otherwise, it's a Draw.

Similarly, if d_x is odd and |d_y| <= (d_x + 1) / 2, Alice can win.

Otherwise, it's a Draw.

But in the second test case, d_x=2, |d_y|=0 <=1, Bob wins.

In the third test case, d_x=0, |d_y|=2 >0, Draw.

In the fourth test case, d_x=4, |d_y|=2 <=2, Bob wins.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the board's row and column constraints more carefully.

Wait, in the fourth test case, h=5, w=5, x_a=1, y_a=4, x_b=5, y_b=2.

d_x=4, |d_y|=2.

According to the condition, |d_y| <= d_x / 2, which is 2 <=2, so Bob wins.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps there's an error in the reasoning.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that Alice and Bob are moving towards each other, reducing the row difference by 2 per two moves.

Hence, the effective relative movement is 2 rows closer every two moves.

Meanwhile, the column difference can be reduced by up to 2 per two moves.

Hence, the column difference decreases by up to 2 per two moves.

So, in t = d_x / 2 combined moves, the column difference should be <= 2t for Alice or Bob to win.

But in the fourth test case, t=2, |d_y|=2 <=4, but output is Draw.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that both players can adjust their columns independently, and if they can synchronize their column positions when they meet in rows, then the player who has the last move can win.

Wait, perhaps it's more about who has the last move and can adjust their column to match the other's column.

In the case where d_x is even, Bob has the last move, so he can adjust to match Alice's column.

In the case where d_x is odd, Alice has the last move, so she can adjust to match Bob's column.

Hence:

- If d_x is even, Bob can win if |d_y| <= t, where t = d_x / 2.

- If d_x is odd, Alice can win if |d_y| <= t, where t = (d_x + 1) / 2.

Otherwise, it's a Draw.

Looking back at the test cases:

First test case: d_x=3, t=2, |d_y|=1 <=2, Alice wins.

Second test case: d_x=2, t=1, |d_y|=0 <=1, Bob wins.

Third test case: d_x=0, t=0, |d_y|=2 >0, Draw.

Fourth test case: d_x=4, t=2, |d_y|=2 <=2, Bob wins.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Wait, perhaps there's another condition related to the board's boundaries.

Wait, in the fourth test case, h=5, x_a=1, x_b=5, d_x=4, t=2.

Alice needs to move down 4 rows to reach x_b=5.

Bob needs to move up 4 rows to reach x_a=1.

But in this time, Alice can adjust her column by up to 4 steps, and Bob can adjust his column by up to 4 steps.

Given that |d_y|=2, they can both adjust their columns to match each other's positions.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Wait, perhaps because when they meet at the same row, their column positions don't coincide, and neither can catch the other.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the exact positions after t moves.

Let me simulate it.

Alice starts at (1,4), Bob at (5,2).

After t=2 combined moves:

- Alice moves down 2 rows and adjusts column by some amount.

- Bob moves up 2 rows and adjusts column by some amount.

So, Alice is at (3, 4 + a), where a is the column adjustment, |a| <=2.

Bob is at (3, 2 + b), where |b| <=2.

For Alice to win, she needs to land on Bob's position, i.e., 4 + a = 2 + b, so a - b = -2.

Given that a and b are both in [-2,2], a - b can be in [-4,4].

Hence, a - b = -2 is achievable, e.g., a=-1, b=1.

So, Alice can choose her moves such that she lands on Bob's position.

Similarly, Bob can choose his moves to land on Alice's position.

But according to the output, it's Draw.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the output is "Draw" because both players can prevent the other from winning.

In other words, neither can force a win.

Hence, it's a Draw.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if both players can reach the same position at the same time, but they can choose to avoid each other.

But according to the problem, if a player lands on the opponent's position, they win immediately.

Hence, if both players can reach the same position at the same time, it's possible for both to try to land on each other's position, but since they move alternately, the player who moves last decides the final position.

This is getting too involved.

Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns observed in the test cases.

From the test cases, it seems that:

- When d_x is odd, Alice can win if |d_y| <= (d_x + 1)/2.

- When d_x is even, Bob can win if |d_y| <= d_x / 2.

Otherwise, it's a Draw.

But there are exceptions, as seen in the fourth test case.

Hence, perhaps the condition is more strict.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the specific paths they take.

Given the complexity, I'll proceed with this assumption for now.
