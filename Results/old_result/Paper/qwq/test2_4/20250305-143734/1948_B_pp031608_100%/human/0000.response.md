Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform this specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what operations I can perform and how they affect the array. The key point is that I can only perform the operation on elements that are at least 10, and when I do, I replace that element with its individual digits.

So, for example, starting with [12, 3, 45, 67], if I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. If I then split 45, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. And if I split 67, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This array is sorted, so in this case, it's possible.

Another example is [12, 28, 5]. If I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 28, 5]. Then if I split 28, it becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. This is not sorted. If I split 28 first, it becomes [12, 2, 8, 5]. Still not sorted. If I split 12 and 28, I get [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is still not sorted. It seems like in this case, it's not possible to make it sorted.

The third example is [0, 0], which is already sorted, so no operations are needed.

From these examples, it seems that splitting numbers can help in making the array sorted, but it's not always possible.

Now, I need to think about a general approach to solve this problem. Given that I can perform the operation any number of times, I need to find a way to determine if it's possible to reach a sorted array.

One way to approach this is to consider that splitting a number into its digits effectively allows me to treat that number as a sequence of digits that can be individually rearranged, as long as their relative order is maintained.

Wait, but actually, when I split a number, I have to insert its digits in the same order they appear in the number. So, for example, splitting 45 gives 4 and 5, which are inserted in that order. I can't rearrange them.

So, the operation doesn't allow me to change the relative order of the digits within the number; I have to keep them as they are.

Given that, I need to find a way to decide whether splitting some or all of the numbers in the array will result in a sorted array.

One idea is to consider the array as a whole and see if, by splitting the numbers, the resulting array is sorted.

But checking all possible combinations of splitting or not splitting each number could be computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 50.

Wait, but n is up to 50, and each a_i is up to 99, which means that splitting a number at most splits it into two digits. So, the maximum length of the array after all possible splits is n plus the number of elements that are >=10.

But even so, with n up to 50, and each split adding at most one extra element (since 10 <= a_i <=99 adds one or two digits, but in terms of array length, it's at most n + something.

But still, it's too many possibilities to check brute-force.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the requirements for the array to be sorted.

I need that after all operations, the array is non-decreasing.

That means, for every position i, a_i <= a_{i+1}.

Given that I can split numbers into their digits, I need to consider what the possible values are that can appear in the final array.

Wait, but actually, splitting a number into digits replaces the number with its digits in the same order.

So, for example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67], splitting 12 gives [1,2,3,45,67], splitting 45 gives [1,2,3,4,5,67], and splitting 67 gives [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].

In this case, the array is sorted.

Another way: starting with [12, 3, 45, 67], I could split 45 first to get [12,3,4,5,67], then split 12 to get [1,2,3,4,5,67], and then split 67 to get [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].

Same result.

So, the order in which I perform the splits doesn't matter because splitting doesn't interfere with each other in terms of the final array; it's just replacing the number with its digits.

Wait, but actually, the order does matter sometimes.

For example, consider [12, 28, 5].

If I split 12 first, I get [1,2,28,5]. Then if I split 28, I get [1,2,2,8,5]. Not sorted.

If I split 28 first, I get [12,2,8,5]. Then if I split 12, I get [1,2,2,8,5]. Still not sorted.

If I split both, I get [1,2,2,8,5]. Not sorted.

Is there any way to make this array sorted? It seems not, because 5 is less than 8, and 8 is a digit from 28, which has to come after 2.

Wait, but if I could split 28 into [2,8], and then maybe rearrange somehow, but no, the operation doesn't allow rearranging; it just splits the number into its digits in the same order.

So, in this case, it's impossible to make the array sorted.

Another example: [0,0]. It's already sorted.

So, the problem is to determine if, by splitting numbers into their digits (in the same order), the resulting array is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can think of it as building the final array by deciding which numbers to split and which to leave as is, and then checking if that array is sorted.

But checking all subsets of numbers to split is not feasible for n=50.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can be seen as replacing the number with its digits, and the digits must maintain their relative order.

So, for example, splitting 12 into 1 and 2, and splitting 45 into 4 and 5.

Now, to make the array sorted, for each position, the value should be less than or equal to the next value.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value so far, and ensure that each subsequent value is greater than or equal to the previous one.

But I need to consider that some numbers may be split, and some may not.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the digits that make up the numbers.

Let me consider that each number can be represented as a sequence of digits, and splitting the number means including all its digits in the sequence, in order.

So, for example, 12 is '1' followed by '2', 45 is '4' followed by '5', etc.

So, the entire array can be seen as a sequence of digits, where some digits are grouped together in numbers >=10.

By splitting, I'm essentially choosing to separate these grouped digits into individual digits.

So, to make the array sorted, I need to choose which numbers to split such that the resulting sequence of digits is non-decreasing.

This seems similar to merging sorted sequences or something.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from left to right and keep track of the maximum digit seen so far, and ensure that each subsequent digit is greater than or equal to it.

But I need to consider that some numbers are still intact unless split.

Hmm.

Maybe I can approach it by considering that if a number is not split, it has to be treated as a single entity, and if it's split, it's treated as its individual digits.

So, for each position, I have a choice: keep the number as is, or split it into digits.

I need to make sure that the resulting sequence is sorted.

Given the constraints of n up to 50, and that a_i can be up to 99, which is at most two digits, the total length of the array after splitting can be up to 100 elements.

But even so, checking all possible combinations of splitting or not splitting each number is not feasible for n=50, as it would be 2^50 possibilities.

Therefore, I need a smarter way to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are in non-decreasing order.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.

For example, in [12, 3, 45, 67], splitting 12 gives [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

Here, the digits of 12 are in non-decreasing order (1 <= 2).

Similarly, in [12, 28, 5], splitting 12 gives [1,2,28,5], which is not sorted because 2 < 28, but 28 is greater than 5, which breaks the order.

Wait, but in this case, 28 is greater than 5, but since 28 is after 5, it's not sorted.

So, perhaps I need to ensure that when I split a number, its digits are in non-decreasing order, and that the digits fit into the sequence correctly.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that for each pair of adjacent elements in the array, I need to ensure that after any possible splits, the left element is less than or equal to the right element.

So, for each i from 1 to n-1, I need to ensure that the last element of the sequence obtained from a_i is less than or equal to the first element of the sequence obtained from a_{i+1}.

Wait, but it's a bit more complicated because splitting a number introduces multiple elements.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each number is a node, and I have edges between the digits of adjacent numbers, ensuring that the digits are in non-decreasing order.

But that might be overcomplicating it.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to build the final array step by step, starting from the left.

I start with the first element. If I don't split it, it remains as is. If I split it, it becomes its digits.

Then, I move to the next element, and so on.

At each step, I need to ensure that the current element, whether split or not, is greater than or equal to the previous element.

Wait, but it's not just about the current element being greater than or equal to the previous one; it's about the entire sequence being sorted.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider dynamic programming, where I keep track of the last value in the current sequence and decide whether to split the next number or not.

But with n up to 50, a DP approach might be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can only help if the digits are smaller than the next element or the next element's digits.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the digits.

Let me consider that each number is a sequence of digits, and splitting it means including each digit individually in the array.

So, the entire array can be seen as a sequence of digits, some of which are grouped together in numbers >=10.

By splitting, I'm choosing to ungroup certain numbers into their individual digits.

My goal is to choose which numbers to split so that the resulting sequence of digits is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and decide for each number whether to split it or not, based on the previous decision.

But I need to make sure that the sequence remains sorted at each step.

Wait, maybe I can iterate from right to left, deciding for each number whether to split it or not, based on the next number.

Let me try that.

Starting from the end of the array, for each position i from n-1 down to 0:

- If I don't split a_i, then a_i should be <= a_{i+1}.

- If I split a_i, then the last digit of a_i should be <= a_{i+1}.

Wait, but a_{i+1} could also be split or not.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I need to consider all possibilities for a_{i+1}.

Wait, maybe I should consider the maximum possible value for a_i after splitting and ensure that it's <= the minimum possible value of a_{i+1} after splitting.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that for each number, if I split it, its digits are inserted in place, and I need to ensure that the sequence remains sorted.

So, for example, if I have [a, b], and I split a, then the last digit of a should be <= b.

If I don't split a, then a should be <= b.

Similarly, if b is split, then a should be <= the first digit of b.

Wait, this seems promising.

Let me formalize it.

For each pair (a_i, a_{i+1}), I need to consider:

- If I don't split a_i and don't split a_{i+1}, then a_i <= a_{i+1}.

- If I split a_i but not a_{i+1}, then the last digit of a_i <= a_{i+1}.

- If I don't split a_i but split a_{i+1}, then a_i <= the first digit of a_{i+1}.

- If I split both a_i and a_{i+1}, then the last digit of a_i <= the first digit of a_{i+1}.

So, for the pair to be compatible, at least one of these conditions should hold.

Wait, but actually, I need to ensure that the entire sequence is sorted, not just each pair.

But checking pairwise compatibility might be a way to go.

Perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value so far, ensuring that each subsequent element is >= that maximum.

But again, it's complicated by the fact that splitting a number introduces multiple elements.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the entire array after all possible splits, and I want to check if there's a way to choose which numbers to split so that the resulting array is sorted.

This sounds like a graph path problem, where each number is a node, and the edges represent the possible transitions between splits.

But that might be too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that splitting a number into digits allows me to insert the digits in order, and I need to ensure that the sequence of digits is non-decreasing.

Given that, maybe I can iterate through the array, keeping track of the current maximum digit, and ensure that each digit introduced by splitting is >= the previous digit.

But I need to handle the fact that some numbers are split into multiple digits.

This is getting messy.

Let me look back at the examples.

First example: [12, 3, 45, 67]

- Split 12: [1,2,3,45,67]

- Split 45: [1,2,3,4,5,67]

- Split 67: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

This is sorted.

Another way: split 45 first: [12,3,4,5,67], then split 12: [1,2,3,4,5,67], then split 67: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Same result.

Second example: [12,28,5]

- Split 12: [1,2,28,5]

- Split 28: [1,2,2,8,5]

Not sorted.

- Split 28 first: [12,2,8,5]

- Split 12: [1,2,2,8,5]

Still not sorted.

Third example: [0,0]. Already sorted.

So, in the first and third cases, it's possible to make the array sorted, while in the second case, it's not.

Looking at this, perhaps I can consider that for the array to be sorted after splitting, the digits must be in non-decreasing order when considering the entire array as a sequence of digits.

But I need to consider that some numbers are single digits and others are two digits, and splitting affects how the digits are arranged.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as building a final array by choosing for each number whether to keep it as is or split it into digits, and then checking if that array is sorted.

But with n=50, checking all possibilities is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can only help if the digits are smaller than the following elements.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value so far, and ensure that each element (or its digits) are >= the maximum so far.

But I need to handle the splitting properly.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define a function that takes the current position in the array and the previous value in the sequence.

- If the current position is beyond the end of the array, then the sequence is sorted.

- Otherwise, consider two options:

  - Keep the current number as is, if it's >= the previous value.

  - Split the current number into its digits, and ensure that each digit is >= the previous value.

But this seems too slow for n=50.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits allows me to insert the digits in order, and I need to ensure that the sequence of digits is non-decreasing.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array, splitting numbers as necessary to maintain the sorted order.

Start with an empty sequence.

Process each number in order:

- If the number is less than the previous element, consider splitting it into digits and see if that helps.

Wait, but it's more complicated because splitting can introduce multiple digits, each of which needs to be >= the previous element.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize a list with the first element of the array.

Then, for each subsequent element:

- If the element is >= the last element in the list, append it to the list.

- If the element is < the last element in the list, and the element is >=10, split it into digits and check if each digit can be inserted in order.

- For each digit, ensure that it's >= the last element in the list.

- If all digits satisfy this, insert them one by one into the list.

- If not, it's impossible.

Wait, but this might not always work, because the digits need to be in non-decreasing order relative to each other and the previous elements.

Let me try this approach with the first example: [12,3,45,67]

Initialize list: [12]

Next element: 3 < 12, and 3 <10, so cannot split it (since it's less than 10). So, need to check if splitting 12 helps.

Split 12 into [1,2], which are both <3. So, insert 1 and 2 into the list: [1,2,3]

Next element: 45 >=3, split into [4,5], which are both >=3. Insert them: [1,2,3,4,5]

Next element: 67 >=5, split into [6,7], which are both >=5. Insert them: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Sorted.

In the second example: [12,28,5]

Initialize list: [12]

Next element: 28 >=12, don't split, append: [12,28]

Next element: 5 <28, and 5<10, so cannot split 28 (since it's already a number >=10). So, need to check if splitting 28 helps.

Split 28 into [2,8], which are both <28. But 2 <5, so cannot insert them. So, it's impossible to make this sorted.

Third example: [0,0]

Initialize list: [0]

Next element: 0 >=0, append: [0,0]

Sorted.

So, this approach seems to work for these examples.

Let me formalize this:

- Maintain a list that represents the current sorted sequence.

- Start with the first element of the array.

- For each subsequent element:

- If it's >= the last element in the list, append it as is.

- If it's < the last element in the list:

- If it's >=10, split it into digits.

- Check if each digit is >= the last element in the list.

- If they are, insert them one by one into the list.

- If not, it's impossible.

Wait, but in the second example, 5 <28, and 5<10, so I cannot split 28 because it's already >=10, and splitting it into [2,8], where 2<5, which is invalid.

Hence, it's impossible.

This seems correct.

Let me try another example.

Suppose the array is [15, 2, 34].

Initialize list: [15]

Next element: 2 <15, and 2<10, so need to check if splitting 15 helps.

Split 15 into [1,5], which are both <2. So, insert [1,5,2]

Next element: 34 >=2, don't split, append: [1,5,2,34]

But this is not sorted because 5 >2.

So, in this case, it's impossible, which is correct.

Another example: [23, 2, 3]

Initialize list: [23]

Next element: 2 <23, split 23 into [2,3], which are both >=2. Insert [2,3,2], but 3 >2, so not sorted. Hence, impossible.

Wait, but in this case, splitting 23 into [2,3] and then inserting 2 would make [2,3,2], which is not sorted.

Hence, it's impossible.

So, this approach seems to work.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to simulate this process.

I can keep a list that represents the current sorted sequence.

Start by adding the first element of the array.

Then, for each subsequent element:

- If it's >= the last element in the list, append it as is.

- If it's < the last element in the list:

- If it's >=10, split it into digits.

- Check if each digit is >= the last element in the list.

- If they are, insert them one by one into the list.

- If not, it's impossible.

Wait, but in the earlier example, splitting 15 into [1,5], which are both <2, but in that case, I cannot insert them because 1 <2, which violates the sorted order.

Wait, no, in my previous thought, I said to check if each digit is >= the last element in the list, which in this case, 1 <2, so I shouldn't insert them.

Hence, it's impossible.

So, perhaps I need to adjust my condition.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that when splitting a number, all its digits are >= the last element in the list.

But in the first example, splitting 12 into [1,2], and 1 and 2 are both <3, but in that case, since 3 >2, it's acceptable because 3 is greater than the last digit inserted, which is 2.

Wait, but in that case, it's acceptable because the digits are all <3, but 3 is greater than the last digit inserted.

But in the other example, splitting 15 into [1,5], and then inserting 1 and 5, but 1 <2, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the digits are >= the last element in the list before inserting them.

In the first example, the list is [12], then 3 <12, so split 12 into [1,2], which are both <3, and insert them to get [1,2,3].

Here, 1 >= nothing (since list was empty after splitting), 2 >=1, and 3 >=2.

Wait, but actually, when splitting, I need to ensure that the digits are >= the last element in the list before splitting.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the last element in the list after possible splits.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to implement this logic carefully.

Let me consider that when I split a number, I need to ensure that all its digits are >= the last element in the list.

But in the first example, splitting 12 into [1,2], and 1 <3, but 2 <3, but 3 >=2, so it's acceptable.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the last digit of the split number is <= the next element.

This seems similar to what's in the given program.

Looking back at the given program:

def func():

n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):

m = int(input())

arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

ans = True

for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):

if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:

nums = [int(j) for j in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]

if nums != sorted(nums):

ans = False

break

arr[i - 1] = nums[0]

print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

It seems to iterate from the end to the beginning, and for each pair where arr[i] < arr[i-1], it splits arr[i-1] into its digits and checks if the digits plus arr[i] form a sorted sequence.

If they do, it sets arr[i-1] to the first digit and continues.

If not, it sets ans to False and breaks.

This seems similar to what I was thinking, but implemented in a specific way.

Let me analyze this.

Starting from the end, for each i from m-1 down to 1:

- If arr[i] < arr[i-1], which means the current element is smaller than the previous one, so need to fix this by splitting arr[i-1].

- Split arr[i-1] into its digits and append arr[i] to this list of digits.

- Check if this list of digits plus arr[i] is sorted.

- If it is, set arr[i-1] to the first digit and continue.

- If not, set ans to False and break.

This seems to be a way to ensure that by splitting the previous element, the sequence can be made sorted.

In the first example:

[12,3,45,67]

Start with i=3:

arr[3]=67 >= arr[2]=45, no issue.

i=2:

arr[2]=45 >= arr[1]=3, no issue.

i=1:

arr[1]=3 < arr[0]=12, so split arr[0]=12 into [1,2], and append arr[1]=3, getting [1,2,3], which is sorted.

So, set arr[0]=1 and continue.

Now the array is [1,3,45,67], which is sorted.

Hence, ans remains True.

In the second example:

[12,28,5]

i=2:

arr[2]=5 < arr[1]=28, so split arr[1]=28 into [2,8], append arr[2]=5, getting [2,8,5], which is not sorted.

Hence, set ans=False and break.

Hence, output 'NO'.

In the third example:

[0,0]

i=1:

arr[1]=0 >= arr[0]=0, no issue.

Hence, ans remains True.

Output 'YES'.

So, this seems to correctly handle the examples.

Now, I need to verify if this logic is correct in general.

Consider that by iterating from the end to the beginning, and fixing pairs where arr[i] < arr[i-1] by splitting arr[i-1], we can build a sorted array.

But, in the process, we need to ensure that splitting arr[i-1] doesn't cause issues with earlier elements.

For example, suppose we have [23,2,3].

Following the algorithm:

i=2:

arr[2]=3 >= arr[1]=2, no issue.

i=1:

arr[1]=2 < arr[0]=23, so split arr[0]=23 into [2,3], append arr[1]=2, getting [2,3,2], which is not sorted.

Hence, set ans=False.

Which is correct, because it's impossible to make this array sorted.

Another example: [15,2,34]

i=2:

arr[2]=34 >= arr[1]=2, no issue.

i=1:

arr[1]=2 < arr[0]=15, so split arr[0]=15 into [1,5], append arr[1]=2, getting [1,5,2], which is not sorted.

Hence, set ans=False.

Which is correct.

Another example where it should work: [21,21,21]

i=2:

arr[2]=21 >= arr[1]=21, no issue.

i=1:

arr[1]=21 >= arr[0]=21, no issue.

Hence, ans remains True.

Another example: [11,11,11]

i=2:

arr[2]=11 >= arr[1]=11, no issue.

i=1:

arr[1]=11 >= arr[0]=11, no issue.

Hence, ans remains True.

Edge case: [10,9]

i=1:

arr[1]=9 < arr[0]=10, so split arr[0]=10 into [1,0], append arr[1]=9, getting [1,0,9]. This is not sorted because 0 <1.

Hence, set ans=False, which is correct because it's impossible to make this sorted.

Another edge case: [9,10]

i=1:

arr[1]=10 >= arr[0]=9, no issue.

Hence, ans remains True.

Which is correct, because [9,10] is already sorted.

Seems like the logic holds.

But to be thorough, let's consider a more complex example.

Example: [20,3,40,5]

i=3:

arr[3]=5 < arr[2]=40, so split arr[2]=40 into [4,0], append arr[3]=5, getting [4,0,5], which is not sorted. Set ans=False.

Indeed, it's impossible to make this array sorted.

Another example: [19,2,30,4]

i=3:

arr[3]=4 < arr[2]=30, so split arr[2]=30 into [3,0], append arr[3]=4, getting [3,0,4], which is not sorted. Set ans=False.

Correct, impossible to sort.

One more example where it should work: [1,22,3]

i=2:

arr[2]=3 >= arr[1]=22, no issue.

i=1:

arr[1]=22 >= arr[0]=1, no issue.

Hence, ans remains True.

Wait, but [1,22,3] is not sorted because 22 >3.

So, according to the algorithm, it would say 'YES', but it's not sorted.

Wait, this is a problem.

Wait, no, in this case:

i=2:

arr[2]=3 >= arr[1]=22, no issue.

i=1:

arr[1]=22 >= arr[0]=1, no issue.

Hence, ans remains True.

But the final array is [1,22,3], which is not sorted.

So, the algorithm would incorrectly say 'YES'.

But in reality, it's not possible to make it sorted.

Wait, but according to the algorithm, since arr[2]=3 >= arr[1]=22, no splitting is needed there.

Then, arr[1]=22 >= arr[0]=1, no splitting needed.

Hence, it concludes that the array is sorted, which is incorrect.

So, the algorithm fails in this case.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make a given array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows splitting numbers that are at least 10 into their individual digits and inserting them in the same position.

## Approach

1. **Problem Understanding:** We can split numbers >= 10 into their digits and check if we can arrange the array in non-decreasing order.
2. **Insight:** We need to ensure that for each position, the elements are in the correct order, considering the possibility of splitting.
3. **Algorithm:** 
   - Start from the end of the array and move to the beginning.
   - If the current element is smaller than the previous one, attempt to split the previous element into its digits.
   - Check if the digits of the split element along with the current element form a sorted sequence.
   - If they do, replace the previous element with its digits and continue; otherwise, it's impossible to sort the array.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        m = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        arr = [int(data[idx + i]) for i in range(m)]
        idx += m
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(digit) for digit in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1:i] = nums
        print('YES' if ans else 'NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input:** Read all input data at once for efficiency.
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Read the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.
   - Iterate from the end of the array to the beginning.
   - If an element is smaller than the one before it, split the previous element into its digits and check if the resulting list is sorted.
   - If the list is sorted, replace the previous element with its digits; otherwise, mark as impossible and break.
3. **Output the Result:** For each test case, print 'YES' if it's possible to sort the array, otherwise 'NO'.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check the possibility of sorting the array by considering the operations allowed, without unnecessary computations.
