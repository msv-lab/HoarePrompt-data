Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains 0s and 1s, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the 0s should come before all the 1s. To do this, I can perform operations where I choose any substring and perform a cyclic shift on it. Each operation costs the length of the substring I choose.

My goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve this sorted string. I need to handle multiple test cases, and the input constraints are such that the sum of the lengths of the strings over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift does. If I have a substring, say "10", and I perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "01". The cost is the length of the substring, which in this case is 2. So, for the first test case, "10", I can perform one cyclic shift on the entire string to get "01", which is sorted, and the cost is 2. That matches the first example.

In the second test case, "0000", it's already sorted, so no operations are needed, and the cost is 0.

The third test case, "11000", needs to be transformed into "00011". The example shows a series of operations:

1. Choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "01100". Cost is 3.

2. Choose substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110". Cost is 3.

3. Choose substring [3,5]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00011". Cost is 3.

Total cost is 9.

Wait a minute, is there a more efficient way to do this? Let's see. If I choose the entire string "11000" and perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "01100". Then, choose the substring [1,3]: "011" -> "101", resulting in "10100". Then choose [1,5]: "10100" -> "00101". Hmm, this seems more complicated and costlier. So the approach in the example seems better.

But is there a general way to find the minimum cost?

Let me think differently. Since I can perform cyclic shifts on any substring, and each shift costs the length of the substring, I need a way to count how many times I need to "move" a 1 past a 0.

Wait, in the final sorted string, all 0s should be before all 1s. So, in the original string, any "10" pair is out of order. If I can count the number of such "10" pairs, and find a way to fix them with minimal cost, that might work.

But how does cyclic shifting help in fixing "10" pairs? When I perform a cyclic shift on a substring containing a "10", I can potentially change it to "01", which fixes the pair.

But if there are multiple "10" pairs, I need to fix them all. And I need to do it in such a way that the total cost is minimized.

Let me consider the number of "10" pairs in the string. Each "10" pair needs to be fixed. If I can fix multiple pairs in one operation, that would be better.

For example, in "11000", the pairs are positions (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So, six "10" pairs. If I choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", which fixes pairs (1,3) and (2,3). Cost is 3.

Then, choose [4,5]: "00" -> "00", which doesn't change anything. Wait, "00" doesn't need to be shifted.

Wait, maybe choosing larger substrings can fix multiple "10" pairs at once.

Wait, but in the example, they chose [1,3], [2,4], [3,5], each fixing one "10" pair at a time.

Is there a better way?

Let me think about the problem differently. Suppose I want to move all the 1s to the end of the string. Each cyclic shift allows me to move the last character of the substring to the front of the substring.

Wait, more carefully: a cyclic shift takes the last character and moves it to the front, shifting others to the right.

So, for example, "10" becomes "01" with one shift.

Similarly, "110" becomes "011" with one shift.

So, each shift can fix one "10" pair.

But if I have multiple "10" pairs, I need to fix them all.

Wait, but in "11000", there are multiple "10" pairs, and the example fixes them in three steps, each costing 3.

Is there a way to fix multiple pairs with a single shift?

Well, shifting a larger substring can fix multiple "10" pairs at once.

Wait, in "11000", shifting [1,3] fixes two "10" pairs: (1,3) and (2,3).

Wait, no, (2,3) is "10" which becomes "11" after shifting.

Wait, no, "110" -> "011". So, position 1 was '1', position 2 was '1', position 3 was '0'. After shifting, position 1 is '0', position 2 is '1', position 3 is '1'. So, the "10" pair at positions (1,3) is fixed, and there was no "10" pair at (2,3) in the new string.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of inversions.

In a sorted array, there are no inversions where a higher index has a smaller value than a lower index.

In this case, since it's binary, an inversion is a "10" pair.

So, the number of inversions is the number of "10" pairs.

Each cyclic shift can reduce the number of inversions by a certain amount, depending on the substring chosen.

I need to minimize the total cost to eliminate all inversions.

This seems similar to sorting inversions in an array, but with a different cost function.

In regular sorting, the number of inversions is related to the number of swaps needed.

But here, each operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring shifted.

I need to find a way to eliminate all "10" pairs with minimal total shift lengths.

Is there a formula or a known algorithm for this?

Let me consider the positions of 0s and 1s.

Suppose I have positions of 0s and 1s in the string.

I need to move all the 1s to be after all the 0s.

Each cyclic shift allows me to move a 1 past a number of 0s, but it's a bit tricky to model.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as moving each 1 to its correct position.

For each 1 that is not in its final position (i.e., any 1 that is before some 0), I need to move it past those 0s.

Each cyclic shift can move a 1 past one 0, but at the cost of the substring length.

Wait, maybe I need to count, for each 1 that is not in its final position, how many 0s it needs to be moved past, and multiply by the cost of shifting it past each 0.

But I need to find a way to group these shifts to minimize the total cost.

Wait, perhaps for each position where there is a 1 that should be after some 0s, I can calculate how many 0s are to its right, and sum up the costs accordingly.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion or prefix sums can help here.

Let me try to think of a different approach.

Suppose I count the total number of "10" pairs in the string. Each such pair needs to be fixed.

Each cyclic shift on a substring can fix a certain number of "10" pairs.

I need to find a set of shifts that fixes all "10" pairs with minimal total cost.

This sounds like a minimum cost to repair all inversions.

But it's not straightforward.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose I have "10". Cost to fix is 2, as shown in the first example.

For "11000", the example shows a cost of 9, but is that the minimal cost?

Wait, in "11000", there are two 1s before three 0s.

To fix it, I need to move both 1s after the three 0s.

If I choose the entire string and perform one cyclic shift, "11000" -> "01100", cost is 5.

Then, choose substring [2,4]: "110" -> "011", resulting in "00110", cost is 3.

Total cost is 8, which is better than the example's 9.

Wait, but the example did it in three steps with cost 3 each, totaling 9.

So, 8 is better.

Is there a better way?

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I iterate through the string and count the number of 1s that need to be moved past each "10" pair.

Wait, perhaps inclusion of prefix sums can help.

Let me try to think in terms of the positions of 0s and 1s.

Suppose I have the string "101011".

I need to move the first '1' past the first '0' to some position where it should be.

Similarly, the third '1' needs to be moved past the second '0'.

Wait, more carefully:

In the final sorted string, all 0s come before all 1s.

So, in "101011", the positions of 0s should be before any 1s.

Let me count the number of 0s and 1s.

Total 0s: 2, total 1s: 4.

In the sorted string, the first two characters should be '0', and the last four should be '1'.

So, any '1' that is before position 3 needs to be moved to after position 2.

Similarly, any '0' after position 2 needs to be moved before position 2.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of 1s that are before the position where 0s end.

Let me find the point where 0s end and 1s start.

In the sorted string, all 0s are first, then all 1s.

So, in the original string, any '1' before the position where 0s end needs to be moved.

Similarly, any '0' after the position where 1s start needs to be moved.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of 1s that are before the position where 0s should end.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of 1s that need to be moved past certain 0s.

Suppose I have a '1' at position i, and there are j '0's after it in the final sorted string.

Then, I need to move this '1' past j '0's.

Each move corresponds to a cyclic shift that moves the '1' past one '0'.

But each cyclic shift can involve moving a substring that includes this '1' and some '0's.

Wait, perhaps I can group the shifts.

Wait, maybe inclusion of the positions can help.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the string and keep track of the number of 0s I've seen so far.

Whenever I see a '1', I can add the number of '0's seen so far to the total cost.

This would be similar to counting the number of inversions.

But in this problem, since I can perform operations that can fix multiple inversions at once, I need to find a way to group these inversions.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of inversions.

But in the first example, "10" has one inversion, and the cost is 2.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the cost is equal to the sum over all '1's of the number of '0's that come after them in the original string.

In "10", there is one '1' with one '0' after it, so cost is 1*2 = 2.

Wait, but that's just coincidental.

In "11000", there are two '1's, each with three '0's after them, so 2*3 = 6, but in the example, they showed a cost of 9, but I think that's not minimal.

Wait, in my earlier attempt, I found a way to do it with cost 8.

So, perhaps that heuristic is wrong.

Let me think again.

I need a systematic way to calculate the minimal cost.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a prefix sum.

Let me count the number of '0's to the right of each position.

Then, for each '1', I can add the number of '0's to its right.

That would give me the total number of inversions, but I need to find the minimal cost to fix them.

Wait, but each operation can fix multiple inversions.

So, I need a way to group these inversions into operations that fix multiple inversions at once.

Each operation on a substring of length k can fix up to k-1 inversions, depending on the substring.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of times I need to shift a '1' past a '0'.

Each '1' that is before a '0' needs to be moved past that '0'.

Each such move can be done by performing a cyclic shift on the substring that includes that '1' and the '0'.

But I need to group these shifts efficiently.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the code provided and see if I can understand the logic behind it.

The code is:

def func_1():

n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):

s = list(map(int, input().strip()))

zeroes = s.count(0)

cnt = [0, 0]

ans = 0

for c in s:

cnt[c] += 1

if c == 0:

ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0

else:

ans += zeroes - cnt[0]

print(ans)

So, for each test case, it reads the binary string, converts it to a list of integers, counts the number of zeroes, initializes a count list for 0 and 1, and initializes ans to 0.

Then, for each character in the string:

- Increment the count of that character.

- If the character is 0, and there are some 1s before it (cnt[1] > 0), add 1 to ans.

- If the character is 1, add (zeroes - cnt[0]) to ans.

Finally, print ans.

Wait, let's see what this is calculating.

In the first test case, "10":

- s = [1, 0]

- zeroes = 1

- cnt = [0,0]

- For c=1:

cnt = [0,1]

ans += 0 (since c==1, zeroes - cnt[0] = 1 - 0 = 1, but c is 1)

Wait, no, in the loop:

if c == 0:

ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0

else:

ans += zeroes - cnt[0]

So, for c=1:

ans += 1 - 0 = 1

For c=0:

cnt = [1,1]

ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0 → ans +=1

Total ans = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the first example.

In the second test case, "0000":

- s = [0,0,0,0]

- zeroes = 4

- cnt = [0,0]

- For c=0:

cnt = [1,0]

ans += 0 (since c==0 and cnt[1]==0)

- For c=0:

cnt = [2,0]

ans += 0

- For c=0:

cnt = [3,0]

ans += 0

- For c=0:

cnt = [4,0]

ans += 0

Total ans = 0, which matches the second example.

In the third test case, "11000":

- s = [1,1,0,0,0]

- zeroes = 3

- cnt = [0,0]

- For c=1:

cnt = [0,1]

ans += 3 - 0 = 3

- For c=1:

cnt = [0,2]

ans += 3 - 0 = 3

- For c=0:

cnt = [1,2]

ans += 1 if cnt[1]>0 else 0 → ans +=1

- For c=0:

cnt = [2,2]

ans +=1

- For c=0:

cnt = [3,2]

ans +=1

Total ans = 3 + 3 +1 +1 +1 = 9, which matches the third example.

But earlier I thought that in "11000", it can be done with cost 8. So maybe the minimal cost is 9, and my earlier approach was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the example's cost is indeed minimal, and my earlier attempt was mistaken.

Let me think again.

If I choose substring [1,3]: "110"→"011", cost=3. The string becomes "01100".

Then, choose substring [2,4]: "110"→"011", cost=3. String becomes "00110".

Then, choose substring [3,5]: "110"→"011", cost=3. String becomes "00011".

Total cost 9.

Alternatively, choosing the entire string "11000"→"01100", cost=5. Then choose [2,4]: "110"→"011", cost=3. Total cost 8.

So, 8 seems better than 9.

But according to the code, it's outputting 9 for "11000". So perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, they showed cost 9, but maybe 8 is possible.

Is there a better sequence of operations?

Let me try another sequence.

Start with "11000".

Choose substring [1,5]: "11000"→"01100", cost=5.

Then choose [2,4]: "110"→"011", cost=3. String becomes "00110".

Then choose [3,5]: "110"→"011", cost=3. String becomes "00011".

Total cost: 5+3+3=11, which is worse than 9.

Wait, but earlier I had a sequence that gave me 8.

Wait, no, earlier I had:

Choose [1,3]: "110"→"011", cost=3. String becomes "01100".

Then choose [2,4]: "110"→"011", cost=3. String becomes "00110".

Then choose [3,5]: "110"→"011", cost=3. String becomes "00011". Total cost 9.

Wait, but I thought of choosing [1,5]→"01100", cost=5, then [2,4]→"00110", cost=3, total cost 8.

But in this sequence, after [1,5]→"01100", and then [2,4]→"00110", which is sorted. So total cost 8.

So, why is the code outputting 9?

Maybe the code is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the code is calculating the number of "10" pairs and assigning a cost based on something.

Let me see.

In "11000", number of "10" pairs is:

Positions (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5): total 6 "10" pairs.

The code outputs 9, which is not equal to the number of "10" pairs.

Wait, perhaps it's calculating something else.

Looking back at the code:

ans += zeroes - cnt[0] for each '1'

In "11000", zeroes=3

For first '1': ans += 3 - 0 = 3

For second '1': ans += 3 -1 =2 (since cnt[0]=1 after first '1' and before second '1')

Wait, no, cnt[0] is 0 for the first '1', then after first '1', cnt[0] is still 0 until '0' is encountered.

Wait, let's step through it:

s = [1,1,0,0,0]

zeroes =3

cnt = [0,0]

For c=1:

cnt = [0,1]

ans += 3 -0 =3 → ans=3

For c=1:

cnt = [0,2]

ans +=3 -0=3 → ans=6

For c=0:

cnt=[1,2]

ans +=1 if cnt[1]>0 else 0 → ans+=1 → ans=7

For c=0:

cnt=[2,2]

ans +=1 → ans=8

For c=0:

cnt=[3,2]

ans +=1 → ans=9

So, ans=9

Wait, but according to my earlier sequence, I can do it with cost 8.

So, perhaps the code is overestimating the cost.

Let me check another test case.

Take "101011"

zeroes=2

cnt=[0,0]

For c=1:

cnt=[0,1]

ans +=2 -0=2 → ans=2

For c=0:

cnt=[1,1]

ans +=1 if cnt[1]>0 else 0 → ans+=1 → ans=3

For c=1:

cnt=[1,2]

ans +=2 -1=1 → ans=4

For c=0:

cnt=[2,2]

ans +=1 → ans=5

For c=1:

cnt=[2,3]

ans +=2 -2=0 → ans=5

For c=1:

cnt=[2,4]

ans +=2 -2=0 → ans=5

So, ans=5, which matches the fourth example.

But according to my earlier thinking, I might be able to do it with less.

Wait, let's see.

"101011"

To sort it to "001111"

Possible operations:

Choose [1,2]: "10"→"01", string becomes "011011", cost=2.

Then choose [3,4]: "10"→"01", string becomes "001111", cost=2.

Total cost=4, which is less than 5.

So, the code outputs 5, but apparently, it can be done with cost 4.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the examples, it outputs 5 for this test case.

So, maybe the minimal cost is indeed 5, and my sequence is wrong.

Wait, in my sequence, I did it with cost 4, but maybe that's possible.

Wait, let's verify.

Start with "101011"

Operation 1: Choose [1,2]: "10"→"01", string becomes "011011", cost=2.

Operation 2: Choose [3,4]: "10"→"01", string becomes "001111", cost=2.

Total cost=4.

Is this correct? It seems correct.

But according to the code, it outputs 5.

So, perhaps the code is overestimating the cost.

Let me check another test case.

Take "01101001"

zeroes=3 (positions 1,6,7)

cnt=[0,0]

For c=0:

cnt=[1,0]

ans +=1 if cnt[1]>0 else 0 → ans+=0 → ans=0

For c=1:

cnt=[1,1]

ans +=3 -1=2 → ans=2

For c=1:

cnt=[1,2]

ans +=3 -1=2 → ans=4

For c=0:

cnt=[2,2]

ans +=1 if cnt[1]>0 else 0 → ans+=1 → ans=5

For c=1:

cnt=[2,3]

ans +=3 -2=1 → ans=6

For c=0:

cnt=[3,3]

ans +=1 if cnt[1]>0 else 0 → ans+=1 → ans=7

For c=0:

cnt=[3,3]

ans +=1 if cnt[1]>0 else 0 → ans+=1 → ans=8

For c=1:

cnt=[3,4]

ans +=3 -3=0 → ans=8

But the example output is 11.

Wait, the example output is 11, but according to the code, it's calculating ans=8.

So, perhaps the code is underestimating in some cases and overestimating in others.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, it's outputting 5, but I found a way to do it with cost 4.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

I need to find a better approach.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I need to move all the 1s that are before some 0s to after those 0s.

Each cyclic shift allows me to move a 1 past some 0s, but it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as the number of inversions, where each inversion is a "10" pair.

Each operation can fix multiple inversions at once.

So, perhaps the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of "10" pairs, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, in the first test case, "10" has one "10" pair, and minimal cost is 2.

But in "11000", there are six "10" pairs, and according to the example, cost is 9, but I can do it with cost 8.

Wait, perhaps the cost is equal to the sum of the positions where 1s need to be moved.

Wait, perhaps inclusion of prefix sums can help.

Let me try to think in terms of the final positions of each character.

In the sorted string, all 0s are before all 1s.

So, for each '1' that is before some '0's, I need to move it past those '0's.

Each move corresponds to a cyclic shift, which can move a '1' past multiple '0's in one operation.

Wait, perhaps I can group the '1's that need to be moved past the same '0's.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider that each "10" pair needs to be fixed, and each operation can fix multiple "10" pairs.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of "10" pairs multiplied by some factor.

But in the first test case, one "10" pair costs 2.

In the third test case, six "10" pairs cost 9.

Wait, that doesn't seem to correlate.

Wait, perhaps the cost is equal to the sum of the positions where '1's need to be moved.

Wait, perhaps inclusion of the number of '0's to the right of each '1' gives the cost.

Let me try that.

For each '1' that is before some '0's, count the number of '0's to its right, and sum these up.

In "10", there is one '1' with one '0' to its right: cost=1*2=2.

In "11000", there are two '1's, each with three '0's to their right: cost=2*3=6, but example shows 9, so maybe not.

Wait, perhaps for each '1', the cost is equal to the number of '0's to its right plus one.

Wait, for "10", cost would be 1+1=2.

For "11000", first '1':3+1=4, second '1':3+1=4, total 8, which matches my earlier sequence.

But according to the code, it's 9.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, in "11000", with my sequence of operations, I can do it with cost 8, but maybe there's a better sequence that brings it down to 7 or less.

I need to confirm if 8 is indeed the minimal cost.

Wait, in the fourth test case, "101011" can be sorted with cost 4, but the code outputs 5.

So, perhaps the code is overestimating the cost.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each '1' that needs to be moved, the cost is equal to the number of '0's it needs to be moved past, plus the cost of the shift operation.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the total number of '0's that each '1' needs to be moved past, and sum these up.

In "10", one '1' needs to be moved past one '0', so cost=2.

In "11000", each '1' needs to be moved past three '0's, so 2*3=6, but with operations that can fix multiple inversions at once, the total cost might be less.

Wait, but in reality, it seems that the minimal cost is higher.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the number of '1's times the number of '0's minus the number of "10" pairs.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '1's of the number of '0's to their right.

In "10", it's 1*1=1, but cost is 2.

Wait, doesn't match.

In "11000", it's 2*3=6, but minimal cost seems to be 8.

Wait, perhaps the cost is equal to the sum over all '1's of (number of '0's to their right +1).

In "10": 1*(1+1)=2, matches.

In "11000": 2*(3+1)=8, matches my earlier sequence.

In "101011":

First '1':3 '0's to right, so 3+1=4

Second '1':2 '0's to right, so 2+1=3

Third '1':1 '0' to right, so 1+1=2

Fourth '1':0 '0's to right, so 0+1=1

Total: 4+3+2+1=10, but earlier I thought it could be done with cost 4.

Wait, perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that overlapping shifts can fix multiple inversions.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is less than the sum of individual shifts.

I need to find a way to group these shifts efficiently.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose I find the positions where '1's and '0's are out of place and calculate the minimal cost to move them.

This seems similar to calculating the cost of moving elements in a sorting problem.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to bubble sort, where each swap fixes one inversion.

But in this problem, each operation can fix multiple inversions.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the sum over all '1's of the number of '0's to their right, but divided by the average number of inversions fixed per operation.

But I don't know how to calculate that.

This is getting too vague.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that the problem is complex and that the provided code is a heuristic that works for some cases but not all.

Given that in one of the test cases, it outputs 9, but I can do it with cost 8, and in another, it outputs 5, but I can do it with cost 4, it seems the code is not correct.
