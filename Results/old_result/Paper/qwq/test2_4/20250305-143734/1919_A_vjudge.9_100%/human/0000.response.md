Alright, I've got this problem here about Alice and Bob playing a game with their wallets. So, Alice has a certain number of coins, Bob has another number, and they take turns making moves according to some rules. The goal is to figure out who will win if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the rules of the game. Each turn, the player can choose to either exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet. After that, they have to remove one coin from their current wallet. Importantly, the wallet can't have zero coins before removing one. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

So, in each turn, the player has two choices: swap or not swap, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The game continues until someone can't make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty or when the current player's wallet has zero coins.

I need to think about how this game plays out and find a pattern or a way to determine the winner based on the initial number of coins each has.

Let me consider some small test cases to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first test case: a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: She has 1 coin. She can choose to swap or not swap.

- If she swaps: a=1, b=1. Then she removes one coin: a=0, b=1.

- Now it's Bob's turn: He has 1 coin. He can choose to swap or not swap.

- If he swaps: a=1, b=0. Then he removes one coin: a=0, b=0.

- Now it's Alice's turn again: Both wallets are empty. She can't make a move, so Bob wins.

That matches the first output in the example, which is "Bob".

Another test case: a=1, b=4.

- Alice's turn: She has 1 coin. She can choose to swap or not swap.

- If she doesn't swap: a=0, b=4.

- Bob's turn: He has 4 coins. He can choose to swap or not swap.

- If he doesn't swap: a=0, b=3.

- Alice's turn: She has 0 coins, so she must swap: a=3, b=0.

- Now, a=3, b=0. Bob's turn: He has 0 coins, so he must swap: a=0, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=2. She must swap: a=2, b=0.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=0. He must swap: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. She must swap: a=1, b=0.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=0. He must swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice's turn: Both are zero, so Bob wins.

Wait, but according to the example, the output for a=1, b=4 is "Alice". But in this simulation, it seems like Bob wins. Maybe I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let me try again.

- Alice has 1, Bob has 4.

- Alice decides to swap: a=4, b=1. Then removes one: a=3, b=1.

- Bob's turn: He has 1 coin. He can choose to swap or not swap.

- If he swaps: a=1, b=3. Then removes one: a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: She has 1 coin. She can choose to swap or not swap.

- If she swaps: a=2, b=1. Then removes one: a=2, b=0.

- Bob's turn: He has 0 coins, so he must swap: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. She must swap: a=1, b=0.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=0. He must swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Again, Bob wins, but the example says "Alice". So maybe my simulation is wrong.

Wait, maybe Alice can make a different choice.

Let's try again.

- Alice has 1, Bob has 4.

- Alice decides not to swap: a=0, b=4.

- Bob's turn: He has 4 coins. He can choose to swap or not swap.

- If he doesn't swap: a=0, b=3.

- Alice's turn: She has 0 coins, so she must swap: a=3, b=0.

- Bob's turn: He has 0 coins, so he must swap: a=0, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=2. She must swap: a=2, b=0.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=0. He must swap: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. She must swap: a=1, b=0.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=0. He must swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Same result. But the example says "Alice". So maybe in some scenarios, Alice can win.

Let me look at the second test case again.

In the problem statement, for a=1, b=4, it says Alice wins. But in my simulation, Bob wins. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

- Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1.

- Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2.

- Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2.

- Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1.

- Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0.

- Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins."

Wait, in this simulation, Alice wins by choosing to swap initially.

But in my earlier simulation, I also tried swapping initially, and still Bob won. Maybe I made a mistake.

Let me follow the steps as in the problem statement.

- Alice has 1, Bob has 4.

- Alice chooses to swap: now a=4, b=1.

- Alice removes one: a=3, b=1.

- Bob's turn: he has 1 coin.

- Bob chooses to swap: a=1, b=3.

- Bob removes one: a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: she has 1 coin.

- Alice chooses not to swap: a=0, b=2.

- Alice removes one: a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: he has 2 coins.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob removes one: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: she has 0 coins.

- She must swap: a=1, b=0.

- Alice removes one: a=0, b=0.

- Bob's turn: both are zero.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Wait, in this simulation, Alice wins because Bob can't make a move.

But in my previous simulation, I had Bob winning. Maybe I messed up the steps.

So, according to the problem's example, Alice can win by choosing to swap initially.

But in my first simulation, where Alice didn't swap initially, Bob won.

So, Alice has a choice that leads to her winning and one that leads to her losing.

In optimal play, Alice would choose the move that leads to her winning.

So, in this case, swapping initially leads to Alice's win, while not swapping leads to her loss.

Hence, Alice should choose to swap initially.

But in the first test case, where a=1 and b=1, if Alice swaps, it leads to her loss.

Wait, in the first test case:

- a=1, b=1.

- Alice chooses to swap: a=1, b=1.

- Alice removes one: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: he has 1 coin.

- Bob chooses not to swap: a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

So, in this case, Alice should choose not to swap initially.

Wait, but according to the problem's example, Bob wins in this case.

So, it seems that in some cases, swapping is better, in others, not swapping is better.

But how does Alice know which one to choose?

Wait, maybe there's a pattern based on the difference between a and b.

Looking at the problem, it says to output "Alice" if Alice wins, and "Bob" if Bob wins, assuming both play optimally.

Looking at the sample input and output:

10

1 1 -> Bob

1 4 -> Alice

5 3 -> Bob

4 5 -> Alice

11 9 -> Bob

83 91 -> Bob

1032 9307 -> Alice

839204 7281 -> Alice

1000000000 1000000000 -> Bob

53110 2024 -> Bob

Looking at these, it seems that when the difference between a and b is even, Bob wins, and when it's odd, Alice wins.

Wait, let's check:

1 1: diff=0, even -> Bob

1 4: diff=3, odd -> Alice

5 3: diff=2, even -> Bob

4 5: diff=1, odd -> Alice

11 9: diff=2, even -> Bob

83 91: diff=8, even -> Bob

1032 9307: diff=8275, odd -> Alice

839204 7281: diff=831923, odd -> Alice

1000000000 1000000000: diff=0, even -> Bob

53110 2024: diff=51086, even -> Bob

Yes, this seems to match.

So, the program provided is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

Which exactly matches this observation: if the absolute difference between a and b is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

But is this correct?

Well, based on the sample inputs and outputs, it seems correct.

But I need to think if this is always true.

Let me try to think of the game in terms of game theory.

This seems like an impartial game, where both players have the same moves available to them at each step.

In such games, we can use the concept of Nimbers or the mex function to determine the winning positions.

But perhaps there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider the game state as a pair (a, b), where a and b are the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Each move consists of:

1. Choosing to swap or not swap.

2. Removing one coin from the current wallet.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty or when the current player's wallet has zero coins.

I need to find a way to determine the winner based on the initial (a, b).

Looking back at the sample cases, it seems that the difference between a and b determines the winner.

But maybe it's about the parity of the difference.

Wait, in the first test case, a=1, b=1. diff=0, even -> Bob wins.

Second test case, a=1, b=4. diff=3, odd -> Alice wins.

Third test case, a=5, b=3. diff=2, even -> Bob wins.

Fourth test case, a=4, b=5. diff=1, odd -> Alice wins.

And so on.

So, it seems that if the difference is even, Bob wins; if odd, Alice wins.

But is this always true?

Let me try to generalize.

Suppose a and b are both even.

What happens?

Let's take a=2, b=2.

- Alice's turn: she can choose to swap or not swap.

- If she doesn't swap: a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: he can choose to swap or not swap.

- If he doesn't swap: a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: she can choose to swap or not swap.

- If she doesn't swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: he has 1 coin. He can choose to swap or not swap.

- If he swaps: a=1, b=0.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=0. She can choose to swap or not swap.

- If she swaps: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1. He must swap: a=1, b=0.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=0. She must swap: a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Wait, in this case, a=2, b=2. diff=0, even. According to the earlier pattern, Bob should win, but in this simulation, Alice wins.

Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe the pattern isn't just about the difference being even or odd.

Maybe there's more to it.

Let me try another simulation.

a=2, b=2.

- Alice's turn: swap or not swap.

- If she swaps: a=2, b=2. Then removes one: a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: swap or not swap.

- If he doesn't swap: a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: swap or not swap.

- If she doesn't swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: must swap: a=1, b=0.

- Alice's turn: must swap: a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Again, Alice wins, which contradicts the earlier pattern.

Wait, but in the sample input, for a=1, b=1, Bob wins.

So, in that case, diff=0, even, Bob wins.

But in a=2, b=2, diff=0, even, Alice wins.

Conflicting results for the same parity of difference.

So, perhaps the pattern is not just based on the difference being even or odd.

Maybe there's something else involved.

Let me try another approach.

Let's think in terms of the total number of coins.

Total coins = a + b.

Each move reduces the total by one coin.

The game ends when a player can't make a move, which is when both wallets are empty or when the current player's wallet is empty.

Wait, but the game can end in a situation where both wallets are empty, or only one is empty.

But in either case, the player whose turn it is and can't make a move loses.

So, the total number of moves that can be made is equal to the total number of coins, since each move removes one coin.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Maybe I need to think in terms of who makes the last move.

The player who makes the last move will be the one who wins, because the opponent can't make any more moves.

So, if the total number of moves is odd, and Alice starts, then Alice makes the last move and wins.

If the total number of moves is even, then Bob makes the last move and wins.

Wait, but that can't be right because in the first test case, a=1, b=1. Total coins=2, which is even. So Bob wins, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, a=1, b=4. Total coins=5, which is odd. So Alice wins, again matching the sample output.

Another test case: a=2, b=2. Total coins=4, even. So Bob wins.

But earlier, in my simulation, Alice won. Maybe I made a mistake in that simulation.

Let me try simulating a=2, b=2 again.

- Alice's turn: swap or not swap.

- If she doesn't swap: a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: swap or not swap.

- If he doesn't swap: a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: swap or not swap.

- If she doesn't swap: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: must swap: a=1, b=0.

- Alice's turn: must swap: a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Wait, total coins were 4, which is even, so according to the earlier hypothesis, Bob should win, but in this simulation, Alice wins.

This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe it's not about the total number of coins, but about the difference.

Wait, in the first test case, difference is 0, even, Bob wins.

In the second test case, difference is 3, odd, Alice wins.

In the third test case, difference is 2, even, Bob wins.

And so on.

So perhaps the difference being even or odd determines the winner.

But in the a=2, b=2 case, difference is 0, even, Bob should win, but in my simulation, Alice wins.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in that simulation.

Let me try again.

- Alice has 2, Bob has 2.

- Alice chooses to swap: a=2, b=2. Then removes one: a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: he has 2 coins. He chooses to swap: a=1, b=2. Then removes one: a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: she has 1 coin. She chooses to swap: a=1, b=1. Then removes one: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: he has 1 coin. He chooses to swap: a=1, b=0. Then removes one: a=0, b=0.

- Alice's turn: both are zero. She can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Ah, in this simulation, Bob wins, which matches the difference being even.

So, earlier I must have made a mistake in the simulation.

Therefore, the pattern seems to hold: if the difference between a and b is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

So, the given program seems to be correct.

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

This matches the observed pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See the program above}} \]
