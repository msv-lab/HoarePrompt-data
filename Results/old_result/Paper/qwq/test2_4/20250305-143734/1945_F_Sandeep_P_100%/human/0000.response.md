I've been given a Python program to evaluate for correctness based on a provided problem description. The problem involves managing a collection of mushrooms with specific magic powers, arranged under a Wise Oak, and Kirill needs to pick mushrooms in a particular way to maximize the strength of an elixir he wants to make. The program uses a `SortedList` class, which seems custom, to manage the mushrooms' magic powers and their indices.

First, I need to understand the problem statement thoroughly. There are n mushrooms, each with a magic power value, and there's a permutation p that dictates the order in which the magic powers might be zeroed out if certain conditions are met. Kirill picks mushrooms one by one, and based on the permutation p, the magic powers of some mushrooms can be set to zero, which affects the final strength of the elixir.

The strength of the elixir is defined as the product of the number of mushrooms in it and the minimum magic power among those mushrooms. The goal is to pick mushrooms in such a way that this strength is maximized, and among the options that maximize strength, choose the one with the minimum number of mushrooms.

Looking at the program, it seems to be using a `SortedList` to manage the mushroom magic powers. The `SortedList` is a mutable sequence that maintains its items in sorted order, which could be useful for quickly finding the minimum magic power or for maintaining order while performing operations.

The main function reads input for multiple test cases, processes each one, and outputs the maximum elixir strength and the minimum number of mushrooms required to achieve that strength for each test case.

To verify the correctness of the program, I need to ensure that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. This involves:

1. Reading the input correctly.

2. Managing the permutation p and the magic powers v appropriately.

3. Simulating the process of picking mushrooms in an order that maximizes the elixir strength.

4. Ensuring that among the options that maximize strength, the one with the smallest number of mushrooms is chosen.

5. Outputting the results in the correct format.

Looking at the code, the main logic seems to be encapsulated in the loop that runs for each test case. For each test case, it reads n, the list of magic powers a, and the permutation p. It then creates a `SortedList` from a and performs operations based on the permutation p.

However, upon closer inspection, I'm not entirely sure how the operations within the loop achieve the desired outcome. Specifically, the use of `sl.discard(a[b[i - 1] - 1])` inside the loop is unclear in terms of how it relates to the problem's conditions.

Let me try to re-express the problem in my own words to better understand it.

We have n mushrooms, each with a magic power value. There's a permutation p that represents the order in which certain mushrooms' magic powers might be zeroed out, depending on how many mushrooms Kirill picks.

When Kirill picks k mushrooms, the magic powers of the mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} are set to zero. He then makes an elixir using the remaining mushrooms (excluding those set to zero), and the strength is the product of the number of mushrooms used and the minimum magic power among them.

The task is to choose k (the number of mushrooms picked) in such a way that the strength of the elixir is maximized, and among all such k values, choose the smallest k.

First, I need to understand the relationship between k and the magic powers that are zeroed out.

Wait a minute. The problem says that if Kirill picks k mushrooms, the magic powers of mushrooms at indices p_1 through p_{k-1} become zero. So, he picks k mushrooms, but some of the mushrooms' magic powers are zeroed based on the permutation p.

Wait, this seems a bit tricky. Let's think carefully.

- Kirill picks k mushrooms.

- As a result, the magic powers of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} are set to zero.

- He then uses the remaining mushrooms (excluding those set to zero) to make the elixir.

- The strength is the product of the number of mushrooms used and the minimum magic power among them.

So, the mushrooms used in the elixir are all mushrooms except those at positions p_1 through p_{k-1}.

Wait, but the problem says "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, the mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} have their magic powers set to zero and are not used in the elixir.

Therefore, the mushrooms used in the elixir are those not in positions p_1 through p_{k-1}.

Wait, no. The problem says "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0" and "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, the mushrooms used in the elixir are those not in positions p_1 through p_{k-1}.

Wait, but actually, the problem might be zeroing out the magic powers of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1}, and then Kirill uses the remaining mushrooms, meaning those not in p_1 through p_{k-1}, to make the elixir.

Wait, but the problem says "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 . Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, the mushrooms used in the elixir are those not in p_1 through p_{k-1}.

Wait, but actually, the problem says "Kirill picks only k mushrooms", meaning he picks k mushrooms, and as a result, the magic powers of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} are set to zero, and then he uses the remaining mushrooms (excluding those with zero magic power) to make the elixir.

Wait, but it's a bit confusing. Let's see.

Suppose Kirill picks k mushrooms. Then, the magic powers of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} are set to zero. Then, he uses the remaining mushrooms (excluding those with zero magic power) to make the elixir.

Wait, but "remaining mushrooms" might refer to the mushrooms not picked, but according to the problem, it's the mushrooms not having zero magic power.

Wait, perhaps I need to rephrase.

When Kirill picks k mushrooms, the magic powers of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} are set to zero. Then, he uses the mushrooms that are not set to zero magic power to make the elixir.

So, the mushrooms used in the elixir are those not in p_1 through p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, representing indices of mushrooms.

So, p_1 to p_{k-1} are the first k-1 indices in the permutation when Kirill picks k mushrooms.

Wait, but actually, p is a permutation from 1 to n, and p_1 to p_{k-1} are the first k-1 elements of this permutation.

So, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic powers set to zero, and then he uses the remaining mushrooms (those not set to zero) to make the elixir.

Wait, but actually, the problem says "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 . Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} have their magic powers set to zero, and he doesn't use those in the elixir.

Therefore, the mushrooms used in the elixir are those not in p_1 through p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p is a permutation of 1 to n, so p_1 to p_{k-1} are specific indices.

So, the mushrooms used in the elixir are those at indices not in p_1 through p_{k-1}.

Moreover, Kirill can pick any k mushrooms, meaning he can choose any k mushrooms to pick, and accordingly, the first k-1 in the permutation p will have their magic powers set to zero.

Wait, but the permutation p is fixed; it's given as part of the input.

So, Kirill chooses k, and based on that k, the first k-1 elements of p have their magic powers set to zero, and then he uses the remaining mushrooms (excluding those with zero magic power) to make the elixir.

Wait, but actually, the problem says "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 . Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, for a given k, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic powers set to zero, and then he uses the remaining mushrooms (those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}) to make the elixir.

Wait, but Kirill picks k mushrooms, but it's not specified which k mushrooms he picks, only that the first k-1 in the permutation p have their magic powers set to zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Looking back, the problem says: "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 . Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, for a given k, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic powers set to zero, and then he uses the remaining mushrooms (excluding those with zero magic power) to make the elixir.

Wait, but it's not clear which mushrooms he picks; it seems like for each k, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their magic powers set to zero, and then he uses the remaining mushrooms to make the elixir.

But the problem says "Kirill picks only k mushrooms", meaning he picks exactly k mushrooms, and as a result, the first k-1 in p have their magic powers set to zero.

Wait, perhaps Kirill picks k mushrooms in a specific way, but it's not clear.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Kirill picks k mushrooms, and as a result, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic powers set to zero. Then, he uses the remaining mushrooms (excluding those with zero magic power) to make the elixir.

Wait, but the problem says "Kirill picks only k mushrooms", meaning he picks exactly k mushrooms, and because of that, the first k-1 in p have their magic powers set to zero.

Then, he uses the remaining mushrooms, excluding those with zero magic power, to make the elixir.

Wait, but "the remaining mushrooms" might refer to the mushrooms not picked, but according to the problem, he excludes mushrooms with zero magic power, which are the first k-1 in p.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of choosing k and then seeing which mushrooms are usable.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Kirill picks k mushrooms, and as a result, the first k-1 in p have their magic powers set to zero, and then he makes the elixir using the mushrooms that are not set to zero.

Wait, but he picked k mushrooms, so perhaps the mushrooms he picks are the ones he uses for the elixir, excluding those with zero magic power.

Wait, but the problem says "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, among the k mushrooms he picks, some may have their magic powers set to zero, and he excludes those.

Wait, but the magic powers are set to zero based on the first k-1 in p, which are indices of mushrooms.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the permutation p defines an ordering of the mushrooms, and picking k mushrooms means considering the first k-1 in this ordering have their magic powers zeroed.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me consider that for each k from 1 to n, I can compute the strength of the elixir if Kirill picks k mushrooms, and then choose the k that maximizes this strength, and among those, choose the smallest k.

So, for each k, I need to:

- Set the magic powers of mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} to zero.

- Use the remaining mushrooms (those not set to zero) to make the elixir.

- Compute the strength as the product of the number of mushrooms used and the minimum magic power among them.

Then, select the k that gives the maximum strength, and among those, choose the smallest k.

But this approach would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient way.

Looking at the code provided, it seems to be trying to iterate through possible k values and keep track of a sorted list of magic powers, discarding certain mushrooms based on the permutation p.

Specifically, it initializes a SortedList with all magic powers, then iterates k from 1 to n, discarding a specific mushroom based on p for each k, and keeping track of the maximum strength.

But I need to verify if this aligns with the problem's requirements.

Looking back, the code does:

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

sl = SortedList(a)

ans = 0

score = 0

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if len(sl) < i:

break

cur = i * sl[-i]

if cur > score:

score = cur

ans = i

sl.discard(a[b[i - 1] - 1])

print(score, ans)

So, for each k from 1 to n:

- It checks if the sorted list has at least k elements.

- Computes the current score as k multiplied by the k-th smallest magic power (sl[-i] seems off; should it be sl[i-1] for the i-th smallest?).

- If this score is better, updates the best score and records k.

- Then discards a specific mushroom from the sorted list, specifically a[b[i-1]-1].

Wait, this seems problematic.

First, sl is a SortedList of all a's.

Then, for each k from 1 to n:

- It computes cur = k * sl[-k], which seems like k times the (n - k + 1)-th largest element, but I think it should be k times the minimum among the used mushrooms.

- Then it discards a[b[i-1]-1], which is the mushroom at position p_i (since b is p).

But according to the problem, when picking k mushrooms, the first k-1 in p have their magic powers set to zero, and then he uses the remaining mushrooms excluding those with zero magic power.

So, it seems like the code is trying to simulate picking k mushrooms by discarding a specific mushroom each time, but it's not clear if this aligns with the problem's conditions.

I think there's a misunderstanding in the code.

Let me try to think differently.

I need to maximize the strength, which is the product of the number of mushrooms used and the minimum magic power among them.

Given that some mushrooms' magic powers are set to zero based on the permutation p and the number k of mushrooms picked, I need to choose k such that the strength is maximized.

Wait, perhaps instead of iterating k from 1 to n, I can consider choosing a subset of mushrooms to use for the elixir, excluding those whose magic powers are set to zero based on k.

But it's getting too convoluted.

Let me consider another approach.

Let's consider that for a given k, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic powers set to zero, and Kirill uses the remaining mushrooms (excluding those with zero magic power) to make the elixir.

So, for a given k, the mushrooms used in the elixir are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p is a permutation of 1 to n, representing indices of mushrooms.

So, p_1 to p_{k-1} are the first k-1 indices in the permutation, and their magic powers are set to zero.

Then, Kirill uses the mushrooms that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1} to make the elixir.

Wait, but he picks k mushrooms, so perhaps there's a relationship between the mushrooms he picks and the permutation p.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the permutation p defines the order in which mushrooms are considered for zeroing out their magic powers based on how many mushrooms Kirill picks.

Wait, perhaps I should iterate over possible k values and compute the strength accordingly.

Wait, perhaps binary search can be used to find the optimal k.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look back at the code and see what it's doing step by step.

It initializes a SortedList with all magic powers.

Then, for each k from 1 to n:

- Checks if the sorted list has at least k elements.

- Computes cur = k * sl[-k], which is k times the (n - k + 1)-th largest element, I think.

- If cur is better than the current score, updates score and records k.

- Discards a specific mushroom from the sorted list: a[b[i-1]-1], which is a[p_i -1], since b is p.

Wait, p is 1-based, so p_i corresponds to b[i-1].

But according to the problem, when picking k mushrooms, the first k-1 in p have their magic powers set to zero, and then he uses the remaining mushrooms excluding those with zero magic power.

So, perhaps the code is trying to simulate that by iteratively discarding a specific mushroom for each k.

But it's not clear to me.

I think there's a flaw in the logic.

Let me consider a small example.

Take the first test case from the sample input:

6

3

9 8 14

3 2 1

So, n=3, a=[9,8,14], p=[3,2,1]

So, p_1=3, p_2=2, p_3=1

Let's compute for k=1:

- Set the magic powers of p_1 to p_{1-1}=p_1=3 to zero. So, a[2]=14 is set to zero.

- Use the remaining mushrooms: a[0]=9 and a[1]=8

- So, strength = 2 * min(9,8) = 16

For k=2:

- Set the magic powers of p_1 and p_2=3 and 2 to zero. So, a[2]=14 and a[1]=8 are set to zero.

- Use the remaining mushrooms: a[0]=9

- Strength = 1 * 9 = 9

For k=3:

- Set the magic powers of p_1 and p_2 and p_3=3,2,1 to zero. So, a[2]=14, a[1]=8, a[0]=9 are all set to zero.

- No mushrooms left to use.

- Strength = 0

So, the maximum strength is 16 with k=2.

Which matches the sample output.

Now, let's see what the code does for this case.

Initialize sl = SortedList([9,8,14]), which is [8,9,14]

For k=1:

- sl has at least 1 element.

- cur = 1 * sl[-1] = 1 * 14 = 14

- 14 > 0, so score=14, ans=1

- Discard a[b[0]-1] = a[2-1]=a[1]=8

- sl becomes [9,14]

For k=2:

- sl has at least 2 elements.

- cur = 2 * sl[-2] = 2 * 9 = 18

- 18 > 14, so score=18, ans=2

- Discard a[b[1]-1] = a[1-1]=a[0]=9

- sl becomes [14]

For k=3:

- sl has at least 3 elements? No, sl has only 1 element.

- Break

- Output score=18, ans=2

Wait, but according to the sample, it should be 16, not 18.

Hmm, seems like a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I miscomputed.

Wait, in the sample explanation, for k=2, strength is 2 * min(9,8)=16, but according to the code, it's computing cur = k * sl[-k], which for k=2 is 2 * sl[-2]=2 * 9=18, which is higher than the actual possible strength.

So, the code seems to be incorrect here.

Wait, perhaps the code is not correctly simulating the problem's conditions.

Looking back, the code computes cur = i * sl[-i], which seems to be i times the (n - i + 1)-th largest element.

But according to the problem, for each k, the strength should be k times the minimum among the mushrooms used, which are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, sl[-i] seems to be picking the larger elements, but the problem requires considering the minimum among the used mushrooms.

Hence, the code is flawed.

I think the approach is incorrect.

An alternative approach is needed.

Let me think differently.

I need to maximize k * min(a[j]) where j are the indices not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

I need to choose k and the corresponding set of mushrooms to maximize this product.

I need to find the k and the corresponding set of mushrooms such that k is minimized among all k that give the maximum strength.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can iterate over possible min values and find the best k for each.

Wait, maybe I can sort the a values and try to find the optimal k.

Wait, here's an idea.

I can iterate over each possible min value, and for each min value, find the maximum k that allows me to have at least k mushrooms with that min value or higher, excluding the first k-1 in p.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think about fixing the min value.

Suppose I fix the min value to be a certain value x.

Then, I need to choose a subset of mushrooms where all their magic powers are >= x, and the number of such mushrooms is k, after excluding the first k-1 in p.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following approach.

Sort the a values in decreasing order.

Then, iterate through possible k from 1 to n, and for each k, find the strength as k times the (n - k + 1)-th largest a value, provided that the conditions about p are satisfied.

But I need to ensure that the mushrooms used are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, perhaps I need to track which mushrooms are being zeroed out for each k.

Wait, maybe it's better to iterate over possible k and compute the strength accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each k, which mushrooms are zeroed out, and then find the minimum among the remaining mushrooms.

But with n up to 2e5, this is not feasible directly.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the permutation p defines the order in which mushrooms are zeroed out as k increases.

Wait, p is given, so p_1 to p_{k-1} are zeroed out when k mushrooms are picked.

So, for increasing k, more mushrooms are zeroed out.

Wait, actually, higher k means more mushrooms are zeroed out, which might reduce the number of usable mushrooms and change the minimum magic power.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate k from 1 to n, keep track of which mushrooms are zeroed out, and compute the strength accordingly.

But again, this seems O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that I need to maximize k * min(a[j]), where j are the mushrooms not zeroed out.

Given that the zeroed out mushrooms are p_1 to p_{k-1}, which are specific indices based on the permutation p.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each k, the mushrooms zeroed out are p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for k=1, zeroed out are p_1 to p_{0}, which is none.

For k=2, zeroed out is p_1.

For k=3, zeroed out are p_1 and p_2, and so on.

So, for each k, the zeroed out mushrooms are p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Hence, the mushrooms used are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for each k, the usable mushrooms are those not in the first k-1 of p.

Wait, p is a permutation of 1 to n, representing indices of mushrooms.

So, p_1 to p_{k-1} are the first k-1 indices in the permutation, and their corresponding a values are set to zero.

Then, the usable mushrooms are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for each k, the usable mushrooms are those not in the first k-1 of p.

Hence, for k=1, usable mushrooms are all except those in p_1 to p_{0}, which means all mushrooms.

For k=2, usable mushrooms are all except p_1.

For k=3, usable mushrooms are all except p_1 and p_2, and so on.

Wait, but according to the problem, when k mushrooms are picked, the first k-1 in p have their magic powers set to zero, and then he uses the remaining mushrooms excluding those with zero magic power.

Hence, for each k, the usable mushrooms are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for each k, the usable mushrooms are those not in p_1 to p_{
