Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, the problem is about breaking down a problem of difficulty x into n sub-problems, each with a positive integer difficulty, and the sum of these difficulties should be equal to x. Then, we need to find the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these n sub-problems.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder. So, if I have n numbers, all divisible by some number d, then d is a common divisor. The greatest such d is the GCD.

Now, I need to maximize this GCD. So, I need to choose the difficulties of the sub-problems in such a way that their GCD is as large as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Given that the sum of the difficulties is x, and there are n sub-problems, I need to distribute x into n parts, each being a positive integer, and find the maximum d such that d divides all of these n parts.

Wait, but if d divides each of the n parts, then it must also divide their sum, which is x. So, d must be a divisor of x.

That seems like an important insight. So, the GCD d must be a divisor of x.

Moreover, since all n parts must be at least d (because d divides each part and d is the GCD), the sum of the n parts must be at least n*d.

But the sum is x, so x must be at least n*d.

So, d cannot be larger than x/n.

Wait, but d has to divide x, and d has to be such that it's possible to split x into n parts, each being a multiple of d, and summing up to x.

Wait, actually, if d is a divisor of x, and n <= x/d, then it's possible to have n parts, each of size at least d, summing up to x.

Wait, let me think again.

If d is a divisor of x, and we set each sub-problem to have difficulty d, then the sum would be n*d. But we need the sum to be x.

So, if n*d = x, then we can set each sub-problem to have difficulty d, and the GCD would be d.

But if n*d < x, then we can still set some sub-problems to have difficulty greater than d, as long as all are multiples of d, and the sum is x.

Wait, but in that case, the GCD would still be d, because d divides each sub-problem's difficulty.

Wait, but if some sub-problems have difficulty greater than d, say d*k where k > 1, then d still divides d*k.

So, as long as d divides x and n*d <= x, it's possible to have a GCD of d.

Wait, but I need to maximize d.

So, among all divisors d of x where n*d <= x, I need to choose the largest d.

Wait, but is that the only condition?

Wait, actually, no. Because even if n*d <= x, it might not be possible to distribute x into n parts, each being a multiple of d, summing up to x.

Wait, but actually, it is possible.

Because if n*d <= x, and d divides x, then x - n*d is divisible by d.

Wait, x is divisible by d, and n*d is divisible by d, so x - n*d is divisible by d.

So, I can set n-1 sub-problems to have difficulty d, and the last one to have difficulty x - (n-1)*d.

Since x - (n-1)*d is divisible by d, the last sub-problem's difficulty is also a multiple of d.

And the sum is x, and all sub-problems have difficulties that are multiples of d, so the GCD is d.

Therefore, as long as d is a divisor of x and n*d <= x, it's possible to achieve a GCD of d.

So, to maximize d, I need to find the largest divisor d of x such that n*d <= x.

In other words, d <= x/n, and d divides x.

So, I need to find the largest divisor of x that is at most x/n.

Now, how do I find the largest divisor of x that is at most x/n?

One way is to iterate through all possible divisors of x and find the largest one that is <= x/n.

But iterating through all divisors of x could be time-consuming if x is large, say up to 10^8.

I need an efficient way to find the divisors of x.

I recall that the number of divisors of x is usually small, especially if x is not a prime power.

In general, the number of divisors of x is O(sqrt(x)), but that's still too many for x up to 10^8.

Wait, but actually, the number of divisors of x is much smaller, especially for numbers with many prime factors.

But in the worst case, x could be a number with many divisors.

Anyway, to optimize, I can iterate through all possible divisors up to sqrt(x), and keep track of the largest divisor that is <= x/n.

Wait, but the code provided seems to be doing something similar.

Let me look at the code.

The code defines a function func_1() that reads x and n, and then iterates through possible divisors i from 1 to sqrt(x), checks if i is a divisor of x, and then checks if n <= x//i or n <= i, and updates the answer accordingly.

Wait, let's see.

It has:

for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):

if x % i == 0:

if n <= x // i:

ans = max(ans, i)

elif n <= i:

ans = max(ans, x // i)

So, it's considering i as a possible divisor, and also x//i as another divisor.

So, it's iterating through all possible divisors of x, considering both i and x//i, and choosing the largest one that satisfies certain conditions.

Now, I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First, it's iterating i from 1 to sqrt(x), inclusive.

For each i, if i is a divisor of x (i.e., x % i == 0), then it considers i and x//i as potential divisors.

Then, it checks:

if n <= x // i:

ans = max(ans, i)

elif n <= i:

ans = max(ans, x // i)

Wait, this seems a bit confusing.

Let me rephrase it.

So, for each divisor pair (i, x//i), it's checking:

- If n <= x // i, then it takes i as a candidate.

- Else, if n <= i, then it takes x // i as a candidate.

Wait, why is it doing that?

Wait, let's think about what we need.

We need d to be a divisor of x, and d <= x/n.

So, we need to find the largest d such that d divides x and d <= x/n.

So, in the code, it's trying to find such a d.

Let's see:

- For each i from 1 to sqrt(x), if i divides x, then consider d = i and d = x//i.

- Then, check if d <= x/n, and keep the maximum d that satisfies this.

But in the code, it's checking if n <= x // i, then ans = max(ans, i), else if n <= i, ans = max(ans, x // i).

Wait, this seems not directly matching what I thought.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Suppose d is a divisor of x, and d <= x/n, then d is a candidate.

So, among all divisors d of x that are <= x/n, we take the maximum d.

So, in the code, for each i from 1 to sqrt(x):

- If x % i == 0, then d can be i or x//i.

- If i <= x/n, then i is a candidate.

- If x//i <= x/n, then x//i is a candidate.

Wait, but it's not exactly doing that.

Wait, perhaps I need to see what the code is actually doing.

Let me take an example.

Take x = 10, n = 3.

So, sqrt(10) is approximately 3, so i goes from 1 to 3.

For i=1:

x % 1 == 0, so check if 3 <= 10//1=10, which is true, so ans = max(0,1)=1.

For i=2:

x % 2 == 0, so check if 3 <= 10//2=5, which is true, so ans = max(1,2)=2.

For i=3:

x % 3 !=0, so skip.

So, ans = 2, which matches the first test case's answer.

Another test case: x=5, n=5.

sqrt(5)~2, so i=1 and i=2.

i=1:

5%1==0, 5<=5//1=5, so ans=max(0,1)=1.

i=2:

5%2!=0, skip.

So, ans=1, matches the second test case.

Third test case: x=420, n=69.

sqrt(420)~20, so i from 1 to 20.

Let's see:

i=1: 69<=420//1=420, which is true, ans=1.

i=2: 69<=420//2=210, true, ans=2.

i=3: 69<=420//3=140, true, ans=3.

i=4: 69<=420//4=105, true, ans=4.

i=5: 69<=420//5=84, true, ans=5.

i=6: 69<=420//6=70, true, ans=6.

i=7: 69<=420//7=60, true, ans=7.

i=8: 69<=420//8=52, true, ans=8.

i=9: 69<=420//9=46, true, ans=9.

i=10: 69<=420//10=42, true, ans=10.

i=11: 69<=420//11=38, true, ans=11.

i=12: 69<=420//12=35, true, ans=12.

i=13: 69<=420//13=32, true, ans=13.

i=14: 69<=420//14=30, true, ans=14.

i=15: 69<=420//15=28, true, ans=15.

i=16: 69<=420//16=26, true, ans=16.

i=17: 69<=420//17=24, true, ans=17.

i=18: 69<=420//18=23, true, ans=18.

i=19: 69<=420//19=22, true, ans=19.

i=20: 69<=420//20=21, true, ans=20.

Now, for i=20, ans=20.

But according to the sample output, the answer should be 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood something.

Wait, maybe the code is not correct.

Wait, but in the first and second test cases, it matches.

But in the third one, it gives ans=20, but the sample output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify if d=20 is a valid divisor.

x=420, d=20, then x/d=21, which is greater than or equal to n=69.

Wait, no, x/d=21, which is greater than n=69.

Wait, no, x/d=420/20=21, which is less than n=69.

Wait, but according to earlier reasoning, we need n <= x/d.

In the code, it checks if n <= x//i, then ans = max(ans, i).

So, for i=20, x//i=21, n=69 <=21 is false, so it shouldn't take i=20.

Wait, but in the code, it only takes i if n <= x//i.

Wait, but in this case, n=69 > x//i=21, so it shouldn't take i=20.

Wait, but according to the code, it has:

if n <= x // i:

ans = max(ans, i)

elif n <= i:

ans = max(ans, x // i)

So, in this case, n=69 <= x//i=21 is false, so it checks elif n <= i, which is n=69 <= i=20, which is false, so it doesn't take x//i.

So, according to the code, for i=20, it doesn't update ans.

Wait, but in my earlier manual simulation, I thought it would take i=20, but according to the code, it only takes i if n <= x//i, otherwise checks if n <=i, then takes x//i.

Wait, but in this case, n=69 > x//i=21 and n=69 > i=20, so it doesn't take anything.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, I think I misread the code.

Wait, let's correct that.

So, for i from 1 to sqrt(x), if x%i==0, then:

if n <= x//i:

ans = max(ans, i)

elif n <= i:

ans = max(ans, x//i)

So, in the case of x=420, n=69:

For i=1: n=69 <= x//1=420, which is true, so ans=1.

For i=2: n=69 <= x//2=210, true, ans=2.

...

For i=15: n=69 <= x//15=28, true, ans=15.

For i=16: n=69 <= x//16=26, true, ans=16.

For i=17: n=69 <= x//17=24, true, ans=17.

For i=18: n=69 <= x//18=23, true, ans=18.

For i=19: n=69 <= x//19=22, true, ans=19.

For i=20: n=69 <= x//20=21, false, then checks if n=69 <= i=20, which is false, so no update.

So, ans=19.

But according to the sample output, it should be 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the first two test cases, it matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the sample output is wrong, but unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the GCD in another way.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the largest d such that d divides x and x/d >=n.

Wait, but that's what I thought earlier.

Wait, but in the third test case, x=420, n=69.

So, d must be a divisor of 420, and 420/d >=69.

We need to find the largest such d.

So, let's list the divisors of 420.

420 can be factored as 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7.

So, the divisors are all combinations of these prime factors.

But to list them all would take time, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find d = x // n.

Wait, d = floor(x / n).

So, d = floor(420 / 69) = floor(6.08...) = 6.

Is 6 a divisor of 420? Yes, because 420 / 6 = 70.

So, d=6, and n*d=6*69=414, which is less than x=420.

Then, I can set 68 sub-problems with difficulty 6, and one with difficulty 420 - 68*6 = 420 - 408 = 12.

But 12 is also divisible by 6, so the GCD is 6.

So, d=6 is achievable.

But according to the code, in the third test case, it outputs 6, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but earlier in my simulation, I thought ans=19, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simulation.

Wait, let's check for i=6.

For i=6: x=420, i=6, x//i=70, n=69 <=70, true, so ans=max(ans,6)=6.

Similarly, for i=19: x//19=22, n=69 >22, so no update.

Wait, but for i=6, it would set ans=6.

But 19 is larger than 6, but 19 is not a divisor that satisfies n <=x//i.

Wait, x=420, i=19, x//i=22, n=69 >22, and n=69 >i=19, so no update.

So, the maximum d is 6.

So, the code seems correct in this case.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, I thought ans=19, but that's wrong because for i=19, n=69 > x//19=22, and n=69 >i=19, so no update.

So, ans remains 6.

Okay, so the code is correct in this case.

Wait, but earlier I thought ans=19, but that's incorrect because the condition isn't satisfied for i=19.

So, the code is correct.

Let me check another example.

Take x=12, n=3.

sqrt(12)~3.46, so i from 1 to 3.

i=1: n=3 <= x//1=12, true, ans=1.

i=2: n=3 <= x//2=6, true, ans=2.

i=3: n=3 <= x//3=4, true, ans=3.

So, ans=3.

Is this correct?

If d=3, then we can have sub-problems of difficulties 3, 3, and 6, whose sum is 12, and GCD is 3.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, d=1: sub-problems 4,4,4, GCD=4, but 4>3, which contradicts.

Wait, no, d must be the GCD, and all sub-problems must be multiples of d.

If d=3, sub-problems 3,3,6, sum=12, GCD=3.

If d=4, sub-problems 4,4,4, sum=12, GCD=4.

But d=4 divides x=12, and n*d=12<=12, so it's possible.

But according to the code, it would output 3, but actually 4 is possible.

Wait, this is a problem.

Wait, no, d=4 is also a divisor of 12, and n*d=3*4=12 <=x=12.

So, d=4 should be considered.

But in the code, for i=1:

n=3 <= x//1=12, ans=1.

i=2:

n=3 <= x//2=6, ans=2.

i=3:

n=3 <= x//3=4, ans=3.

i=4:

But i only goes up to sqrt(12)~3.46, so i=1,2,3.

So, it misses d=4.

Wait, but d=4 is x//i where i=3, because x//3=4.

But in the code, for i=3, x//i=4, and n=3 <=i=3, so ans=max(3, x//i=4)=4.

Wait, no, according to the code:

if n <= x//i:

ans = max(ans, i)

elif n <= i:

ans = max(ans, x//i)

So, for i=3:

n=3 <= x//3=4, which is true, so ans=max(3,3)=3.

Wait, but x//i=4 is greater than n=3, so it should take i=3.

Wait, no, the condition is n <= x//i, then ans=max(ans, i).

So, for i=3, n=3 <= x//i=4, so ans=max(3,3)=3.

But d=4 is also a divisor, and n*d=12 <=x=12.

So, the code is missing d=4.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, d=4 should be considered.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the code to consider x//i as well.

Wait, in the code, for each i, it considers i and x//i.

But in the condition, it only takes i if n <= x//i, and x//i if n <=i.

So, for i=3, x//i=4, n=3 <=4, so it takes i=3.

But d=4 is x//i=4, and n=3 <=i=3, which is true, so it should take x//i=4.

Wait, no, in the code, the elif condition is elif n <=i, then ans=max(ans, x//i).

So, for i=3:

n=3 <=i=3, which is true, so ans=max(3, x//3=4)=4.

So, ans=4, which is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, I thought ans=3, but actually it's ans=4.

Let me recast it.

For i=1:

n=3 <= x//1=12, ans=1.

For i=2:

n=3 <= x//2=6, ans=2.

For i=3:

n=3 <=i=3, so ans=max(2, x//3=4)=4.

So, ans=4, which is correct.

I must have made a mistake earlier.

So, the code is correct in this case.

Another test case: x=10, n=3.

From earlier, ans=2, which matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=5, n=5.

From earlier, ans=1, which matches the sample output.

And the third test case: x=420, n=69.

From earlier, ans=6, which matches the sample output.

So, the code seems correct.

But in my earlier mistake, I thought it would take i=19 and set ans=19, but actually, for i=19, n=69 > x//i=22, and n=69 >i=19, so no update.

So, ans remains 6.

Therefore, the code is correct.

I think my earlier confusion was due to a misinterpretation of the code's logic.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the balance (GCD) of a set of sub-problems derived from a given problem of difficulty `x`, divided into `n` sub-problems.

### Approach

1. **Understanding GCD and Divisors**:
   - The GCD of the sub-problems must be a divisor of `x`.
   - To maximize the GCD, we need the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `n * d <= x`.

2. **Iterate Through Possible Divisors**:
   - We iterate `i` from `1` to the square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, if `i` is a divisor of `x`, we consider both `i` and `x // i` as potential GCD values.
   - We select the largest `d` where `n <= x // d`.

3. **Optimal Selection**:
   - For each divisor `i`, if `n <= x // i`, it means we can have `n` sub-problems each of size at least `i`, so `i` is a candidate for GCD.
   - Similarly, if `n <= i`, then `x // i` is another candidate for GCD.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def func_1():
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    sqrt_x = int(math.isqrt(x))
    for i in range(1, sqrt_x + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `x` and `n`.

2. **Finding Maximum GCD**:
   - Calculate the integer square root of `x` using `math.isqrt(x)`.
   - Iterate from `1` to `sqrt(x)`:
     - If `i` is a divisor of `x`:
       - Check if `n <= x // i`, update `ans` with `i`.
       - Check if `n <= i`, update `ans` with `x // i`.
   - Print the maximum possible GCD for each test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal GCD by leveraging the properties of divisors and the GCD function, making it both correct and efficient for large values of `x`.
