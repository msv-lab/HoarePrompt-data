Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp has two favorite integers, x and y, and he has an array of numbers. He considers a pair of indices <i, j> (where i < j) beautiful if two conditions are met:

1. The sum of a_i and a_j is divisible by x.

2. The difference between a_i and a_j is divisible by y.

I need to find out how many such beautiful pairs exist in the array for each test case.

First, I need to understand what it means for a sum or difference to be divisible by something. If a sum a_i + a_j is divisible by x, that means (a_i + a_j) % x == 0. Similarly, if the difference a_i - a_j is divisible by y, then (a_i - a_j) % y == 0.

I need to find pairs where both these conditions hold true.

Let me think about how to approach this efficiently, especially since the array can be quite large (up to 2*10^5 elements per test case), and there can be up to 10^4 test cases. But it's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, which is good because that means overall time complexity should be O(N), where N is 2*10^5.

So, I need an algorithm that can handle this within reasonable time limits.

Let me consider the properties of modulo operations here. If a_i + a_j is divisible by x, then:

(a_i + a_j) % x == 0

Which implies:

(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0

Similarly, for the difference:

(a_i - a_j) % y == 0

So, I can think in terms of the modulo classes of a_i and a_j with respect to x and y.

I need to find pairs where:

1. (a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0

2. (a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0

Wait, but y and x could be different, and I need to find a way to pair these modulo classes appropriately.

Maybe I can store the frequency of each combination of a % x and a % y in a dictionary.

Let me think about it step by step.

For each element a in the array, I can compute:

mod_x = a % x

mod_y = a % y

Now, for a pair <i, j> to be beautiful, we need:

(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0

And

(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0

Let me rearrange these conditions.

First condition:

(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0

This means that a_j % x should be such that when added to a_i % x, it sums up to a multiple of x. In other words, a_j % x should be (x - a_i % x) % x.

Second condition:

(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0

This means that a_j % y should be equal to a_i % y.

So, for a pair to be beautiful, a_j should satisfy:

1. a_j % x == (x - a_i % x) % x

2. a_j % y == a_i % y

So, for each a_i, I can look for a_j's that have a specific combination of modulo x and modulo y.

This seems like a good candidate for using a frequency map where the keys are tuples of (mod_x, mod_y), and the values are the counts of how many times that combination appears in the array.

Then, for each a_i, I can compute the required (mod_x_required, mod_y_required) for a_j, and look up how many a_j's satisfy that condition in the frequency map.

But I need to be careful to avoid counting pairs where i == j, and also to ensure that i < j.

So, I should iterate through the array, and for each a_i, look up the frequency of the required (mod_x_required, mod_y_required), and then subtract one if a_j could be a_i itself, but since we're dealing with frequencies, and assuming that the frequency map is updated after processing each element, I need to make sure to handle the counts correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to build the frequency map first, and then iterate through the array, and for each a_i, add the frequency of the required (mod_x_required, mod_y_required), and then subtract one if a_i satisfies the conditions with itself, but since i < j, maybe it's okay.

Let me think about potential overlaps.

Actually, since i < j, and we process the array in order, I can build the frequency map incrementally. That way, when processing a_i, the frequency map contains only elements a_j where j > i.

So, in this way, I can avoid counting pairs where j <= i.

This seems manageable.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n, x, y.

b. Read the array a of size n.

c. Initialize a frequency map freq as an empty dictionary.

d. Initialize a counter beautiful_count to 0.

e. For each a_i in the array a:

i. Compute mod_x = a_i % x.

ii. Compute mod_y = a_i % y.

iii. Compute required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x.

iv. Compute required_mod_y = mod_y.

v. If (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, add freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] to beautiful_count.

vi. If (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, set freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0.

vii. Increment freq[mod_x, mod_y] by 1.

f. Output beautiful_count.

3. Repeat for all test cases.

This seems like a plausible plan. Now, let's think about why this works.

For each a_i, we're looking for a_j's that come after it in the array (since we're building freq incrementally after processing a_i), and that satisfy:

- a_j % x == required_mod_x = (x - a_i % x) % x

- a_j % y == mod_y = a_i % y

By keeping track of how many such a_j's have been seen so far (but actually, since we're building freq after processing a_i, it only includes a_j's with j > i), we can accumulate the count of beautiful pairs.

This should give the correct total count of beautiful pairs.

Let me consider an example to verify.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 6, x = 5, y = 2

a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]

Let's compute the beautiful pairs manually.

Possible pairs:

<1,5>: 1+9=10 divisible by 5, 1-9=-8 divisible by 2 → beautiful

<4,6>: 4+6=10 divisible by 5, 4-6=-2 divisible by 2 → beautiful

So, total of 2 beautiful pairs.

Now, let's simulate the algorithm:

Initialize freq = {}

Process a_1 = 1:

mod_x = 1 % 5 = 1

mod_y = 1 % 2 = 1

required_mod_x = (5 - 1) % 5 = 4

required_mod_y = 1

Check if (4,1) in freq: no, so beautiful_count += 0

Add (1,1) to freq: freq[(1,1)] = 1

Process a_2 = 2:

mod_x = 2 % 5 = 2

mod_y = 2 % 2 = 0

required_mod_x = (5 - 2) % 5 = 3

required_mod_y = 0

Check if (3,0) in freq: no, so beautiful_count += 0

Add (2,0) to freq: freq[(2,0)] = 1

Process a_3 = 7:

mod_x = 7 % 5 = 2

mod_y = 7 % 2 = 1

required_mod_x = (5 - 2) % 5 = 3

required_mod_y = 1

Check if (3,1) in freq: no, so beautiful_count += 0

Add (2,1) to freq: freq[(2,1)] = 1

Process a_4 = 4:

mod_x = 4 % 5 = 4

mod_y = 4 % 2 = 0

required_mod_x = (5 - 4) % 5 = 1

required_mod_y = 0

Check if (1,0) in freq: no, so beautiful_count += 0

Add (4,0) to freq: freq[(4,0)] = 1

Process a_5 = 9:

mod_x = 9 % 5 = 4

mod_y = 9 % 2 = 1

required_mod_x = (5 - 4) % 5 = 1

required_mod_y = 1

Check if (1,1) in freq: yes, freq[(1,1)] = 1, so beautiful_count += 1

Add (4,1) to freq: freq[(4,1)] = 1

Process a_6 = 6:

mod_x = 6 % 5 = 1

mod_y = 6 % 2 = 0

required_mod_x = (5 - 1) % 5 = 4

required_mod_y = 0

Check if (4,0) in freq: yes, freq[(4,0)] = 1, so beautiful_count += 1

Add (1,0) to freq: freq[(1,0)] = 1

Total beautiful_count = 2, which matches the expected output.

Good, seems correct.

Let me think about another test case.

Take the second example:

n = 7, x = 9, y = 5

a = [1,10,15,3,8,12,15]

Let's find beautiful pairs manually.

Possible pairs:

Check <1,4>: 1+3=4 not divisible by 9, skip

<1,5>: 1+8=9 divisible by 9, 1-8=-7 divisible by 5? -7 % 5 == 3, no

<1,6>: 1+12=13 not divisible by 9

<1,7>: 1+15=16 not divisible by 9

<2,5>: 10+8=18 divisible by 9, 10-8=2 not divisible by 5

<2,6>: 10+12=22 not divisible by 9

<2,7>: 10+15=25 not divisible by 9

<3,5>: 15+8=23 not divisible by 9

<3,6>: 15+12=27 divisible by 9, 15-12=3 not divisible by 5

<3,7>: 15+15=30 divisible by 9, 15-15=0 divisible by 5 → beautiful

<4,5>: 3+8=11 not divisible by 9

<4,6>: 3+12=15 not divisible by 9

<4,7>: 3+15=18 divisible by 9, 3-15=-12 divisible by 5? -12 % 5 == 3, no

<5,6>: 8+12=20 not divisible by 9

<5,7>: 8+15=23 not divisible by 9

<6,7>: 12+15=27 divisible by 9, 12-15=-3 divisible by 5? -3 % 5 == 2, no

So, only <3,7> is a beautiful pair. But according to the sample output, it's 0. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, is 0 the correct output? Let's check again.

For <3,7>:

Sum: 15 + 15 = 30, 30 % 9 = 3, not 0. Wait, that's not divisible by 9. So, it's not a beautiful pair.

Wait, I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, no beautiful pairs in this case, which matches the sample output of 0.

Good, my algorithm should correctly output 0 for this case.

Let me simulate it quickly.

Initialize freq = {}

Process a_1 = 1:

mod_x = 1 % 9 = 1

mod_y = 1 % 5 = 1

required_mod_x = (9 - 1) % 9 = 8

required_mod_y = 1

Check if (8,1) in freq: no

Add (1,1) to freq: freq[(1,1)] = 1

Process a_2 = 10:

mod_x = 10 % 9 = 1

mod_y = 10 % 5 = 0

required_mod_x = (9 - 1) % 9 = 8

required_mod_y = 0

Check if (8,0) in freq: no

Add (1,0) to freq: freq[(1,0)] = 1

Process a_3 = 15:

mod_x = 15 % 9 = 6

mod_y = 15 % 5 = 0

required_mod_x = (9 - 6) % 9 = 3

required_mod_y = 0

Check if (3,0) in freq: no

Add (6,0) to freq: freq[(6,0)] = 1

Process a_4 = 3:

mod_x = 3 % 9 = 3

mod_y = 3 % 5 = 3

required_mod_x = (9 - 3) % 9 = 6

required_mod_y = 3

Check if (6,3) in freq: no

Add (3,3) to freq: freq[(3,3)] = 1

Process a_5 = 8:

mod_x = 8 % 9 = 8

mod_y = 8 % 5 = 3

required_mod_x = (9 - 8) % 9 = 1

required_mod_y = 3

Check if (1,3) in freq: no

Add (8,3) to freq: freq[(8,3)] = 1

Process a_6 = 12:

mod_x = 12 % 9 = 3

mod_y = 12 % 5 = 2

required_mod_x = (9 - 3) % 9 = 6

required_mod_y = 2

Check if (6,2) in freq: no

Add (3,2) to freq: freq[(3,2)] = 1

Process a_7 = 15:

mod_x = 15 % 9 = 6

mod_y = 15 % 5 = 0

required_mod_x = (9 - 6) % 9 = 3

required_mod_y = 0

Check if (3,0) in freq: freq[(3,0)] = 1, so beautiful_count += 1

But wait, earlier I thought there were no beautiful pairs, but according to this, there is one. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, the frequency map at this point contains:

freq[(1,1)] = 1

freq[(1,0)] = 1

freq[(6,0)] = 1

freq[(3,3)] = 1

freq[(8,3)] = 1

freq[(3,2)] = 1

When processing a_7 = 15:

required_mod_x = 3

required_mod_y = 0

And freq[(3,0)] = 1, so it adds 1 to beautiful_count.

But earlier manual check showed that <3,7> is not a beautiful pair because 3 + 15 = 18, which is divisible by 9, but 3 - 15 = -12, which is not divisible by 5.

Wait, but according to the algorithm, it's counting this pair.

So, why is that?

Ah, I see the mistake in my manual check earlier. For a_j, we need to have a_j % x == required_mod_x and a_j % y == required_mod_y.

For a_i = 15:

required_mod_x = (9 - 6) % 9 = 3

required_mod_y = 0

So, we're looking for a_j where a_j % 9 == 3 and a_j % 5 == 0.

Looking at the array:

a_4 = 3: 3 % 9 == 3, 3 % 5 == 3 → does not match required_mod_y = 0

a_6 = 12: 12 % 9 == 3, 12 % 5 == 2 → does not match required_mod_y = 0

a_7 = 15: 15 % 9 == 6, 15 % 5 == 0 → does not match required_mod_x = 3

Wait, a_j should have a_j % 9 == 3 and a_j % 5 == 0.

Looking back at the frequency map, freq[(3,0)] = 1, which corresponds to a_j = 15.

Wait, but a_j = 15 has 15 % 9 == 6, not 3. So, why is it in freq[(3,0)]?

Wait, no. According to the code, freq keys are (mod_x, mod_y).

Wait, a_j = 3 has mod_x = 3 % 9 = 3 and mod_y = 3 % 5 = 3, so it's freq[(3,3)] = 1.

a_j = 12 has mod_x = 12 % 9 = 3 and mod_y = 12 % 5 = 2, so freq[(3,2)] = 1.

a_j = 15 has mod_x = 15 % 9 = 6 and mod_y = 15 % 5 = 0, so freq[(6,0)] = 1.

Wait, so freq[(3,0)] should be 0, because no a_j has mod_x = 3 and mod_y = 0.

So, why does the algorithm think freq[(3,0)] = 1?

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Looking back:

After processing a_1: freq[(1,1)] = 1

a_2: freq[(1,0)] = 1

a_3: freq[(6,0)] = 1

a_4: freq[(3,3)] = 1

a_5: freq[(8,3)] = 1

a_6: freq[(3,2)] = 1

a_7: looking for (3,0), which is not in freq, but according to my earlier step, it was freq[(3,0)] = 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in keeping track of the frequency map.

Let's list the elements and their corresponding (mod_x, mod_y):

a_1 = 1: (1,1)

a_2 = 10: (1,0)

a_3 = 15: (6,0)

a_4 = 3: (3,3)

a_5 = 8: (8,3)

a_6 = 12: (3,2)

a_7 = 15: (6,0)

So, freq:

(1,1): 1 (a_1)

(1,0): 1 (a_2)

(6,0): 2 (a_3 and a_7)

(3,3): 1 (a_4)

(8,3): 1 (a_5)

(3,2): 1 (a_6)

So, when processing a_7 = 15:

mod_x = 6

required_mod_x = (9 - 6) % 9 = 3

required_mod_y = 0

Looking for (3,0) in freq: freq[(3,0)] = 0 (since no element has mod_x=3 and mod_y=0)

So, beautiful_count += 0

Wait, but earlier I thought freq[(3,0)] = 1, but that's incorrect. There is no element with mod_x=3 and mod_y=0.

So, beautiful_count remains 0, which matches the sample output.

I must have misremembered the frequency map earlier.

So, the algorithm correctly outputs 0 for this test case.

Good, seems correct.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge Case 1: n=2, x=1, y=1, a=[1,1]

Check if <1,2> is beautiful:

sum: 1+1=2 % 1 == 0 (since 2 is divisible by 1)

difference: 1-1=0 % 1 == 0

So, it's a beautiful pair. Total beautiful pairs: 1

According to the algorithm:

Process a_1=1:

mod_x=0, mod_y=0

required_mod_x=(1-0)%1=0, required_mod_y=0

Check if (0,0) in freq: no, so beautiful_count=0

Add (0,0) to freq: freq[(0,0)]=1

Process a_2=1:

mod_x=0, mod_y=0

required_mod_x=(1-0)%1=0, required_mod_y=0

Check if (0,0) in freq: yes, freq[(0,0)]=1, so beautiful_count+=1

Add (0,0) to freq: freq[(0,0)]=2

Output beautiful_count=1, which is correct.

Edge Case 2: n=3, x=2, y=3, a=[1,1,1]

Possible pairs:

<1,2>: sum=2 % 2=0, difference=0 % 3=0 → beautiful

<1,3>: same as above → beautiful

<2,3>: same as above → beautiful

So, total beautiful pairs: 3

According to the algorithm:

Process a_1=1:

mod_x=1, mod_y=1

required_mod_x=(2-1)%2=1, required_mod_y=1

Check if (1,1) in freq: no, beautiful_count=0

Add (1,1) to freq: freq[(1,1)]=1

Process a_2=1:

mod_x=1, mod_y=1

required_mod_x=1, required_mod_y=1

Check if (1,1) in freq: yes, freq[(1,1)]=1, beautiful_count+=1

Add (1,1) to freq: freq[(1,1)]=2

Process a_3=1:

mod_x=1, mod_y=1

required_mod_x=1, required_mod_y=1

Check if (1,1) in freq: yes, freq[(1,1)]=2, beautiful_count+=2

Add (1,1) to freq: freq[(1,1)]=3

Total beautiful_count=1 + 2 = 3, which is correct.

Good.

Edge Case 3: n=2, x=1, y=1, a=[1,2]

Check <1,2>: sum=3 % 1=0, difference=-1 % 1=0 → beautiful

Total beautiful pairs: 1

According to the algorithm:

Process a_1=1:

mod_x=0, mod_y=0

required_mod_x=0, required_mod_y=0

Check if (0,0) in freq: no, beautiful_count=0

Add (0,0) to freq: freq[(0,0)]=1

Process a_2=2:

mod_x=0, mod_y=2 % 1=0

required_mod_x=0, required_mod_y=0

Check if (0,0) in freq: yes, freq[(0,0)]=1, beautiful_count+=1

Add (0,0) to freq: freq[(0,0)]=2

Total beautiful_count=1, which is correct.

Another Edge Case: n=2, x=2, y=2, a=[1,3]

Check <1,2>: sum=4 % 2=0, difference=-2 % 2=0 → beautiful

Total beautiful pairs: 1

According to the algorithm:

Process a_1=1:

mod_x=1, mod_y=1

required_mod_x=(2-1)%2=1, required_mod_y=1

Check if (1,1) in freq: no, beautiful_count=0

Add (1,1) to freq: freq[(1,1)]=1

Process a_2=3:

mod_x=3 % 2=1, mod_y=3 % 2=1

required_mod_x=(2-1)%2=1, required_mod_y=1

Check if (1,1) in freq: yes, freq[(1,1)]=1, beautiful_count+=1

Add (1,1) to freq: freq[(1,1)]=2

Total beautiful_count=1, which is correct.

Seems like the algorithm works for these cases.

Now, let's think about potential pitfalls.

1. x or y equals 1: In this case, any sum or difference is divisible by 1, so the conditions simplify.

2. x and y are equal: Need to ensure the algorithm handles this correctly.

3. Negative differences: But since we're dealing with modulo, the sign doesn't affect divisibility.

4. Elements with the same a_i: Need to ensure that pairs of identical elements are counted correctly if they satisfy the conditions.

5. Frequency map updates: Need to make sure that we update the frequency map after considering a_i, to avoid counting itself or earlier elements.

I think the algorithm handles these cases correctly.

In terms of implementation, I need to read t test cases, and for each test case, read n, x, y and the array a.

I need to process each test case independently and output the beautiful_count for each.

Given that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5, the overall time complexity should be acceptable.

I need to be careful with the frequency map implementation to use a dictionary with tuple keys.

Also, since x and y can be up to 10^9, and a_i up to 10^9, but modulo operations will keep the values manageable.

I should also consider that modulo y might be zero if y divides a_j exactly, but in Python, negative numbers' modulo behavior needs to be considered, but since a_i and a_j are positive integers (as per the sample input), this shouldn't be an issue.

I need to make sure that the frequency map uses tuples of (mod_x, mod_y) as keys, since both conditions need to be satisfied simultaneously.

I should also consider using defaultdict from the collections module to simplify frequency counting, but since the constraints are large, using a regular dictionary should be fine, with checking for key existence before accessing.

In summary, the algorithm seems correct based on the problem description and sample inputs.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array based on given conditions involving modulo operations. The solution involves efficiently tracking the frequency of specific modulo combinations and checking for pairs that satisfy the given criteria.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Conditions:**
   - A pair <i, j> is beautiful if `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` and `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0`.

2. **Modulo Properties:**
   - For the sum condition: `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` implies `a_j % x == (x - a_i % x) % x`.
   - For the difference condition: `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0` implies `a_j % y == a_i % y`.

3. **Frequency Map:**
   - Use a frequency map to track the occurrence of each (mod_x, mod_y) pair as we iterate through the array.
   - For each element, calculate the required (mod_x_required, mod_y_required) for a_j that would make the pair beautiful with a_i.
   - Increment the count by the frequency of this required pair before processing the current element.

4. **Efficient Pair Counting:**
   - Update the frequency map after processing each element to ensure that pairs are only counted where i < j.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n = case['n']
        x = case['x']
        y = case['y']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            key_required = (required_mod_x, required_mod_y)
            if key_required in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[key_required]
            key_current = (mod_x, mod_y)
            if key_current not in freq:
                freq[key_current] = 0
            freq[key_current] += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - For each test case, initialize a frequency map (`freq`) and a counter for beautiful pairs (`beautiful_count`).

2. **Processing Each Element:**
   - For each element `a_i` in the array:
     - Compute `mod_x = a_i % x` and `mod_y = a_i % y`.
     - Determine the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` for `a_j` to form a beautiful pair with `a_i`.
     - Check if this required pair exists in the frequency map and add its frequency to `beautiful_count`.
     - Update the frequency map with the current element's (mod_x, mod_y) pair.

3. **Output Results:**
   - Collect the results for all test cases in a list and return it.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the beautiful pairs by leveraging the properties of modulo operations and frequency mapping, achieving the required time complexity for large input sizes.
