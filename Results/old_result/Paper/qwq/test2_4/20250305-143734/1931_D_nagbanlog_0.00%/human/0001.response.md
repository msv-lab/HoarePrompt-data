Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp has two favorite integers, x and y, and he has an array of numbers. He considers a pair of indices <i, j> (where i < j) beautiful if two conditions are met:

1. The sum of the elements at positions i and j is divisible by x.

2. The difference of the elements at positions i and j is divisible by y.

My task is to find out how many such beautiful pairs exist in the array for given values of n, x, y, and the array a.

First, I need to understand what it means for a sum or difference to be divisible by certain numbers. Let's recall that if a number is divisible by another, it means that when you divide them, the remainder is zero.

So, for the sum a_i + a_j to be divisible by x, it means (a_i + a_j) % x == 0.

Similarly, for the difference a_i - a_j to be divisible by y, it means (a_i - a_j) % y == 0.

I need to find pairs where both these conditions hold true.

Let me think about how to approach this efficiently, especially since the constraints mention that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t (the number of test cases) can be up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5. This suggests that I need an algorithm that's linear or linearithmic in n, probably using hashing or frequency counting.

I recall that in problems involving pairs and divisibility, using modular arithmetic can be helpful. Specifically, looking at the remainders when divided by x and y can simplify the conditions.

Let me consider the first condition: (a_i + a_j) % x == 0.

This can be rewritten as (a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0.

Similarly, the second condition: (a_i - a_j) % y == 0.

This can be thought of as (a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0, which implies that a_i % y == a_j % y.

So, for the difference to be divisible by y, a_i and a_j must be congruent modulo y.

That's interesting. So, for the second condition, a_i ≡ a_j (mod y).

For the first condition, (a_i + a_j) ≡ 0 (mod x).

I need to find pairs where both these conditions are satisfied.

Let me try to combine these two conditions.

Let me denote:

Let’s say a_i ≡ p (mod x)

And a_j ≡ q (mod x)

Then, p + q ≡ 0 (mod x), which means q ≡ -p (mod x).

But also, from the second condition, a_i ≡ a_j (mod y), which means a_i ≡ a_j ≡ r (mod y), for some r.

This seems a bit tricky because x and y could be different and not necessarily related.

I need to find a way to count pairs that satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

Maybe I can use Chinese Remainder Theorem if x and y are coprime, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the combined modulus of x and y if they are coprime, but I don't know if they are.

Alternatively, maybe I can iterate through the array and keep track of some frequency counts based on the remainders of the elements when divided by x and y.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a_i, and I want to find a_j such that:

1. a_j ≡ -a_i (mod x)

2. a_j ≡ a_i (mod y)

So, for each a_i, I'm looking for a_j that satisfies these two congruences.

If I can find the number of a_j's that satisfy both conditions for each a_i, and sum them up, but since each pair is counted twice (once for a_i and once for a_j), I need to handle that.

Wait, but since i < j, I need to make sure I don't double-count.

Actually, in the initial approach, if I iterate through the array and keep a frequency map, I can avoid double-counting by considering the order.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me consider the combined condition:

a_j ≡ -a_i (mod x)

and

a_j ≡ a_i (mod y)

So, for each a_i, I can compute what a_j should be in terms of its remainders modulo x and y.

Then, I can keep a frequency map that counts the occurrences of certain remainder pairs (mod_x, mod_y).

Wait, but remainders are dependent on x and y, which might not be coprime.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can look for a way to combine these two conditions into a single condition, but I'm not sure how.

Let me consider specific examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first example:

n=6, x=5, y=2, a=[1,2,7,4,9,6]

Beautiful pairs are <1,5> and <4,6>.

Let's check:

For <1,5>: a1=1, a5=9

Sum: 1+9=10, which is divisible by 5.

Difference: 1-9=-8, which is divisible by 2.

Similarly, <4,6>: a4=4, a6=6

Sum: 4+6=10, divisible by 5.

Difference: 4-6=-2, divisible by 2.

Looking at the remainders:

For a1=1: 1%5=1, 1%2=1

For a5=9: 9%5=4, 9%2=1

So, (1,1) and (4,1)

Similarly, for a4=4: 4%5=4, 4%2=0

For a6=6: 6%5=1, 6%2=0

So, (4,0) and (1,0)

Wait, so in the frequency map, I can keep track of (mod_x, mod_y) pairs.

Then, for each element, I can determine what the required pair is to form a beautiful pair.

Specifically, for an element with (mod_x, mod_y), the required pair is ((-mod_x) mod x, mod_y).

So, for (1,1), the required pair is (4,1), because (-1 mod 5)=4.

Similarly, for (4,0), the required pair is ((-4 mod 5)=1,0).

Looking back at the frequency map:

Elements and their (mod_x, mod_y):

a1: (1,1)

a2: 2%5=2, 2%2=0 → (2,0)

a3: 7%5=2, 7%2=1 → (2,1)

a4: (4,0)

a5: (4,1)

a6: (1,0)

So, frequency map:

(1,1): 1 (a1)

(2,0): 1 (a2)

(2,1): 1 (a3)

(4,0): 1 (a4)

(4,1): 1 (a5)

(1,0): 1 (a6)

Now, for each element:

a1: (1,1) → requires (4,1): there is one such element (a5)

a2: (2,0) → requires (3,0): no such element

a3: (2,1) → requires (3,1): no such element

a4: (4,0) → requires (1,0): a6 exists

a5: (4,1) → requires (1,1): a1 exists

a6: (1,0) → requires (4,0): a4 exists

But wait, in counting pairs with i < j, we need to ensure we don't double-count.

So, the beautiful pairs are <1,5> and <4,6>.

So, the total is 2, which matches the example.

So, in implementation, I can iterate through the array, keep a frequency map of (mod_x, mod_y) pairs, and for each element, look up how many elements have the required pair ((-mod_x) mod x, mod_y).

But I need to be careful about the order to avoid counting pairs where i >= j.

To handle this, I can process the array in order and maintain the frequency map only for elements that have already been seen (i.e., before the current element).

This way, for each element, I look up the number of elements before it that can form a beautiful pair with it.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize a frequency map freq to store counts of (mod_x, mod_y) pairs.

2. Initialize a counter beautiful_count to 0.

3. Iterate through the array from index 1 to n:

a. For the current element a_i, compute mod_x = a_i % x and mod_y = a_i % y.

b. Compute the required pair for a beautiful pair: required_mod_x = (-mod_x) mod x, required_mod_y = mod_y.

c. Look up the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq.

d. Add the frequency to beautiful_count.

e. Increment the frequency of (mod_x, mod_y) in freq by 1.

4. After processing all elements, beautiful_count will hold the total number of beautiful pairs.

This seems efficient, as it's O(n) per test case, and since the sum of n across all test cases is 2*10^5, it should be acceptable.

Let me verify this approach with the first example:

n=6, x=5, y=2, a=[1,2,7,4,9,6]

Initialize freq = {}, beautiful_count = 0

Process a1=1:

mod_x=1, mod_y=1

required_mod_x=( -1 ) % 5 = 4, required_mod_y=1

freq[(4,1)] = 0

beautiful_count = 0

freq[(1,1)] +=1 → freq[(1,1)]=1

Process a2=2:

mod_x=2, mod_y=0

required_mod_x=(-2)%5=3, required_mod_y=0

freq[(3,0)] = 0

beautiful_count = 0

freq[(2,0)] +=1 → freq[(2,0)]=1

Process a3=7:

mod_x=2, mod_y=1

required_mod_x=(-2)%5=3, required_mod_y=1

freq[(3,1)] = 0

beautiful_count = 0

freq[(2,1)] +=1 → freq[(2,1)]=1

Process a4=4:

mod_x=4, mod_y=0

required_mod_x=(-4)%5=1, required_mod_y=0

freq[(1,0)] = 0

beautiful_count = 0

freq[(4,0)] +=1 → freq[(4,0)]=1

Process a5=9:

mod_x=4, mod_y=1

required_mod_x=(-4)%5=1, required_mod_y=1

freq[(1,1)] =1 (from a1)

beautiful_count =1

freq[(4,1)] +=1 → freq[(4,1)]=1

Process a6=6:

mod_x=1, mod_y=0

required_mod_x=(-1)%5=4, required_mod_y=0

freq[(4,0)] =1 (from a4)

beautiful_count =1 +1=2

freq[(1,0)] +=1 → freq[(1,0)]=1

Total beautiful_count=2, which matches the example.

Great, this seems to work.

Let me consider another example to verify.

Take the second example from the provided input:

7 9 5

1 10 15 3 8 12 15

n=7, x=9, y=5, a=[1,10,15,3,8,12,15]

Compute beautiful pairs.

Let's compute manually:

Possible pairs:

<1,?>: a1=1

Sum with a2=10: 1+10=11 not div by 9

a3=15: 1+15=16 not div by 9

a4=3: 1+3=4 not div by 9

a5=8: 1+8=9 div by 9

diff: 1-8=-7 div by 5? -7 %5 =3, not 0 → not beautiful

a6=12:1+12=13 not div by 9

a7=15:1+15=16 not div by 9

<2,?>: a2=10

Sum with a3=15:10+15=25 not div by 9

a4=3:10+3=13 not div by 9

a5=8:10+8=18 div by 9

diff:10-8=2 not div by 5

a6=12:10+12=22 not div by 9

a7=15:10+15=25 not div by 9

<3,?>: a3=15

Sum with a4=3:15+3=18 div by 9

diff:15-3=12 div by 5? 12%5=2, no

a5=8:15+8=23 not div by 9

a6=12:15+12=27 div by 9

diff:15-12=3 not div by 5

a7=15:15+15=30 div by 9

diff:15-15=0 div by 5 → beautiful pair

So, <3,7> is beautiful.

<4,?>: a4=3

Sum with a5=8:3+8=11 not div by 9

a6=12:3+12=15 not div by 9

a7=15:3+15=18 div by 9

diff:3-15=-12 div by 5? -12%5=3, no

<5,?>: a5=8

Sum with a6=12:8+12=20 not div by 9

a7=15:8+15=23 not div by 9

<6,?>: a6=12

Sum with a7=15:12+15=27 div by 9

diff:12-15=-3 div by 5? -3%5=2, no

<7,?>: a7=15 already considered.

So, only <3,7> is beautiful, but according to the sample output, it's 0.

Wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait, in the sample input, the second test case is:

7 9 5

1 10 15 3 8 12 15

And the corresponding output is 0.

But according to my manual check, <3,7> seems to be a beautiful pair.

Wait, let's check again.

Sum:15+15=30, 30%9=3, not 0 → not divisible by 9.

Oh, I made a mistake. 30 is not divisible by 9. 27 is divisible by 9, but 30 is not.

So, sum is not divisible by 9, hence not a beautiful pair.

So, no beautiful pairs in this test case, which matches the sample output of 0.

Good, my approach seems correct.

Let me consider another example to be sure.

Take the third test case:

9 4 10

14 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 6

n=9, x=4, y=10, a=[14,10,2,2,11,11,13,5,6]

Compute beautiful pairs.

Let's compute manually.

<1,2>:14+10=24 div by 4

diff:14-10=4 div by 10? 4%10=4, no

<1,3>:14+2=16 div by 4

diff:14-2=12 div by 10? 12%10=2, no

<1,4>:14+2=16 div by 4

diff:14-2=12 div by 10? 12%10=2, no

<1,5>:14+11=25 not div by 4

<1,6>:14+11=25 not div by 4

<1,7>:14+13=27 not div by 4

<1,8>:14+5=19 not div by 4

<1,9>:14+6=20 div by 4

diff:14-6=8 div by 10? 8%10=8, no

<2,3>:10+2=12 div by 4

diff:10-2=8 div by 10? 8%10=8, no

<2,4>:10+2=12 div by 4

diff:10-2=8 div by 10? 8%10=8, no

<2,5>:10+11=21 not div by 4

<2,6>:10+11=21 not div by 4

<2,7>:10+13=23 not div by 4

<2,8>:10+5=15 not div by 4

<2,9>:10+6=16 div by 4

diff:10-6=4 div by 10? 4%10=4, no

<3,4>:2+2=4 div by 4

diff:2-2=0 div by 10 → beautiful pair

So, <3,4> is beautiful.

But according to the sample output, it's 1, which matches.

Good.

So, my approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

The function is named func_1, and it takes t (number of test cases) and test_cases (a list of dictionaries, each containing params and array).

It initializes results as an empty list.

For each test case, it extracts n, x, y from params, and the array a.

It initializes a frequency dictionary freq, and a counter beautiful_count to 0.

It then iterates through each number in the array.

For each number, it computes mod_x = num % x and mod_y = num % y.

Then, it computes required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x

And required_mod_y = mod_y

It checks if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, and if so, adds freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] to beautiful_count.

Then, it updates freq[mod_x, mod_y] +=1

Finally, it appends beautiful_count to results and returns results.

This seems to match the approach I outlined.

It processes each element, looks up the required pair in the frequency map, and adds the frequency to the count before incrementing the frequency of the current element.

This should correctly count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
