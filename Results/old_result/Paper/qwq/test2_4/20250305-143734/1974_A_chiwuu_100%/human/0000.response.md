Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each arranged in a 5x3 grid, meaning each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, making a total of 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some take up 1x1 cells and others take up 2x2 cells. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of screens needed to fit all the icons, given the counts of each type of application.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. Each screen has 15 cells. A 1x1 icon takes one cell, and a 2x2 icon takes four cells. Importantly, each cell can be occupied by only one icon, and the icons can't overlap.

So, for each test case, I'm given the number of 1x1 icons (x) and the number of 2x2 icons (y), and I need to calculate the minimum number of screens required to fit all these icons.

I should consider how to optimally place the icons to minimize the number of screens used. Since 2x2 icons take up more space, it might be beneficial to place them first and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

Let me think about the capacity of each screen. Each screen has 15 cells. A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, but I need to make sure that these 4 cells form a valid 2x2 square on the grid. Given that the screen is 5x3, I need to see how many 2x2 squares can fit into this grid.

Let's visualize the grid:

Rows: 1 2 3 4 5

Columns: A B C

So, the grid looks like:

A1 B1 C1

A2 B2 C2

A3 B3 C3

A4 B4 C4

A5 B5 C5

A 2x2 icon would occupy, for example, A1 B1 A2 B2 or B2 C2 B3 C3, etc.

How many such 2x2 squares can fit into this 5x3 grid without overlapping?

Looking at the rows, from rows 1 to 4 (since 2 rows are needed for a 2x2 square), and columns A to B (since 2 columns are needed), so:

Possible positions:

- A1 B1 A2 B2

- B1 C1 B2 C2

- A2 B2 A3 B3

- B2 C2 B3 C3

- A3 B3 A4 B4

- B3 C3 B4 C4

- A4 B4 A5 B5

- B4 C4 B5 C5

So, there are 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons on a single screen.

Each 2x2 icon takes one of these positions, and each position covers 4 cells.

Now, after placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells can be filled with 1x1 icons.

So, for y 2x2 icons, they take up y positions, each covering 4 cells, leaving 15 - 4y cells available for 1x1 icons.

But I need to make sure that the positions chosen for 2x2 icons don't overlap and that the remaining cells can accommodate the 1x1 icons.

However, since the problem allows any arrangement as long as icons don't overlap, and we're trying to minimize the number of screens, I can assume an optimal arrangement.

So, for y 2x2 icons, they take up 4y cells, and x 1x1 icons take up x cells, totaling 4y + x cells needed.

Each screen has 15 cells, so naively, the number of screens required would be ceil((4y + x)/15).

But it's not that simple because of the way 2x2 icons are placed. Since only 8 positions are available for 2x2 icons per screen, and each 2x2 icon takes one position, y must be less than or equal to 8.

Wait, but in reality, placing 2x2 icons might leave some cells unusable for 1x1 icons due to overlapping positions.

Wait, no, each 2x2 icon occupies a specific 4 cells, and as long as their positions don't overlap, the remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps the initial approach is valid.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

1 1

Output:

1

So, x=1, y=1.

Total cells needed: 4*1 + 1*1 = 5 cells.

Since a screen has 15 cells, certainly, one screen is enough.

Another test case:

Input:

7 2

Output:

1

Total cells needed: 4*2 + 7 = 15 cells.

So, exactly one screen is needed.

Another test case:

Input:

12 4

Output:

2

Total cells needed: 4*4 + 12 = 28 cells.

Since one screen has 15 cells, two screens would have 30 cells, which is enough for 28 cells needed.

Another test case:

Input:

0 3

Output:

2

Total cells needed: 4*3 = 12 cells.

One screen has 15 cells, so one screen should be enough, but the output is 2.

Wait, that seems inconsistent with my earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps there's a restriction on how many 2x2 icons can be placed on a single screen.

From my earlier count, there are only 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons per screen.

Each 2x2 icon takes one position.

So, per screen, maximum 8 2x2 icons can be placed.

But in this test case, y=3, which is less than 8, so one screen should be enough.

But the output is 2, which suggests that my initial approach is missing something.

Looking back at the example, for input 0 3, output is 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier count of possible 2x2 positions.

Let me recount the number of possible 2x2 positions on a 5x3 grid.

Rows: 1,2 ; 2,3 ; 3,4 ; 4,5

Columns: A,B ; B,C

So, possible 2x2 squares:

- Rows 1-2, columns A-B: positions (A1,B1,A2,B2)

- Rows 1-2, columns B-C: positions (B1,C1,B2,C2)

- Rows 2-3, columns A-B: positions (A2,B2,A3,B3)

- Rows 2-3, columns B-C: positions (B2,C2,B3,C3)

- Rows 3-4, columns A-B: positions (A3,B3,A4,B4)

- Rows 3-4, columns B-C: positions (B3,C3,B4,C4)

- Rows 4-5, columns A-B: positions (A4,B4,A5,B5)

- Rows 4-5, columns B-C: positions (B4,C4,B5,C5)

So, indeed, 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons per screen.

Each 2x2 icon takes one of these positions.

Now, when y=3, we need to place 3 2x2 icons.

But, looking at the positions, are there any overlapping constraints?

Wait, no, since each 2x2 icon takes a distinct position, and the positions are non-overlapping, we can place up to 8 2x2 icons per screen.

But in the test case where y=3 and x=0, the output is 2, meaning that two screens are needed.

But according to my calculation, one screen should be enough for y=3.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Let me look back at the note and the example output.

In the note, it shows that for input 0 3, output is 2.

But according to my earlier logic, one screen should be enough for y=3, as 3 < 8.

What's going on here?

Wait, perhaps the 2x2 icons are overlapping in terms of cell usage in a way that exceeds the screen's cell capacity.

Let me see: each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

So, for y=3, it's 12 cells.

A screen has 15 cells, so in terms of cell count, one screen should suffice.

But perhaps the positions are such that some cells are shared in a way that makes it impossible to place all 3 icons on one screen.

Wait, but from the positions I listed earlier, it seems possible to place up to 8 non-overlapping 2x2 icons.

For example:

- positions 1: A1,B1,A2,B2

- positions 2: B2,C2,B3,C3

- positions 3: A3,B3,A4,B4

- positions 4: B4,C4,B5,C5

So, placing icons in positions 1, 3, and 4 wouldn't overlap.

Wait, but positions 1 and 2 overlap because position 1 uses B2, and position 2 uses B2.

So, positions 1 and 2 cannot be used simultaneously.

Similarly, positions 3 and 4 overlap because position 3 uses B4, and position 4 uses B4.

So, in reality, the number of non-overlapping 2x2 positions is less than 8.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a maximum set of non-overlapping 2x2 positions.

Looking back, positions:

1: A1,B1,A2,B2

2: B2,C2,B3,C3

3: A3,B3,A4,B4

4: B4,C4,B5,C5

Positions 1 and 3 don't overlap.

Positions 2 and 4 don't overlap.

So, maximum non-overlapping sets:

- Set 1: positions 1 and 2

- Set 2: positions 3 and 4

Each set has 2 non-overlapping positions.

So, per screen, maximum 4 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping.

Wait, but in set 1: positions 1 and 2 overlap at B2.

Wait, no, position 1 uses B2, position 2 uses B2, so they overlap.

Wait, no, they don't overlap; position 1 uses B2, position 2 uses B3.

Wait, position 2 uses B2 and B3.

Wait, position 1: A2, B2, A3, B3

Wait, no, position 1 is A1,B1,A2,B2

Position 2 is B2,C2,B3,C3

So, position 1 uses B2, position 2 uses B2 and B3.

So, they overlap on B2.

Therefore, positions 1 and 2 cannot be used together.

Similarly, positions 3 and 4 overlap on B4.

So, perhaps the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 positions is 4 per screen.

Let me see:

Possible non-overlapping sets:

- positions 1 and 3: uses A1,B1,A2,B2, A3,B3,A4,B4

- positions 2 and 4: uses B2,C2,B3,C3, B4,C4,b5,c5

- positions 1 and 4: uses A1,B1,A2,B2, B4,C4,B5,C5

- positions 2 and 3: uses B2,C2,B3,C3, A3,B3,A4,B4

In all these cases, only 2 non-overlapping positions can be used together.

Wait, no, positions 1 and 3 share B2 and B3.

Wait, position 1 uses B1 and B2, position 3 uses B3 and B4.

So, positions 1 and 3 don't overlap.

Similarly, positions 2 and 4 don't overlap.

So, positions 1 and 3 can be used together, as can positions 2 and 4.

Therefore, per screen, maximum 4 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping.

Wait, but positions 1,3,5,7 don't overlap:

positions 1: A1,B1,A2,B2

positions 3: A3,B3,A4,B4

positions 5: A4,B4,A5,B5

Wait, positions 3 and 5 overlap on A4 and B4.

So, positions 1,3,5,7 don't all work together because positions 3 and 5 overlap.

Similarly, positions 2,4,6,8:

positions 2: B2,C2,B3,C3

positions 4: B4,C4,B5,C5

positions 6: A4,B4,A5,B5

positions 8: B4,C4,B5,C5

Again, positions 4 and 6 overlap on B4 and B5.

So, it seems that the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 positions per screen is 4.

Wait, perhaps it's 5.

Let me try:

- positions 1: A1,B1,A2,B2

- positions 2: B2,C2,B3,C3

- positions 3: A3,B3,A4,B4

- positions 4: B4,C4,B5,C5

- positions 5: A4,B4,A5,B5

Wait, positions 1 and 2 overlap on B2.

Positions 1 and 3 don't overlap.

Positions 1 and 4 don't overlap.

Positions 1 and 5 overlap on A4 and B4.

Positions 2 and 3 overlap on B3.

Positions 2 and 4 don't overlap.

Positions 2 and 5 overlap on B4.

Positions 3 and 4 don't overlap.

Positions 3 and 5 overlap on A4 and B4.

Positions 4 and 5 overlap on B4 and B5.

So, a possible set of non-overlapping positions:

- positions 1, 4

- positions 2, 5

- positions 3

So, maximum 3 non-overlapping 2x2 positions per screen.

Wait, but in positions 1 and 4, no overlap.

Positions 2 and 5, no overlap.

Positions 3 is independent.

So, per screen, maximum 4 2x2 positions can be placed without overlapping.

Wait, but positions 1,3,4 don't overlap.

Wait, positions 1: A1,B1,A2,B2

positions 3: A3,B3,A4,B4

positions 4: B4,C4,B5,C5

Here, positions 1 and 3 don't overlap.

Positions 3 and 4 share B4.

So, positions 1 and 4 don't overlap.

So, positions 1 and 4 can be used together.

Similarly, positions 2 and 5 can be used together.

Positions 3 and 6 can be used together.

But I need to maximize the number of non-overlapping 2x2 positions per screen.

Looking back, perhaps the maximum is 4 per screen.

Given that, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed is ceil(y / 4).

But in the test case where y=3, x=0, output is 2.

According to ceil(3/4)=1, but the output is 2.

Wait, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to calculate it.

Wait, perhaps the issue is not just the number of positions but also the cell usage.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

So, for y=3, it's 12 cells.

A screen has 15 cells.

So, in terms of cell count, one screen should be enough.

But according to the output, two screens are needed.

So, perhaps there's a constraint on the arrangement.

Looking back at the grid:

If I place 2x2 icons in positions 1 and 4:

positions 1: A1,B1,A2,B2

positions 4: B4,C4,B5,C5

That uses cells A1,B1,A2,B2,B4,C4,B5,C5.

Total cells used: 8 cells.

Still, 15 - 8 = 7 cells left for 1x1 icons.

But in this test case, x=0, so no 1x1 icons.

But according to the output, two screens are needed for y=3, x=0.

Wait, maybe the positions are such that some cells are left unusable.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when placing 2x2 icons, some cells become fragmented and can't be used efficiently.

For example, in the first screen, after placing two 2x2 icons, there might be cells that can't be used for 1x1 icons due to the arrangement.

But in this test case, x=0, so we don't have to worry about 1x1 icons.

Wait, but still, the output is 2, meaning one screen isn't enough.

So, perhaps there's a limit to how many 2x2 icons can be placed on a single screen without overlapping, and in this case, only two 2x2 icons can be placed per screen.

Given that, for y=3, you'd need two screens.

But earlier, I thought that four 2x2 icons can be placed per screen.

But according to the test case, it seems only two can be placed per screen.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each 2x2 icon not only takes its four cells but also affects the surrounding cells in terms of placing other icons.

But the problem states that each cell can be occupied by no more than one icon.

So, as long as the 2x2 icons don't overlap, their positions should be independent.

Wait, perhaps the positions are such that placing more than two 2x2 icons on a screen leads to overlapping.

Looking back at the positions:

- positions 1: A1,B1,A2,B2

- positions 2: B2,C2,B3,C3

- positions 3: A3,B3,A4,B4

- positions 4: B4,C4,B5,C5

- positions 5: A4,B4,A5,B5

- positions 6: B4,C4,B5,C5

- positions 7: A5,B5,A6,B6 (but we only have rows 1 to 5)

Wait, positions 5 and 6 are the same as positions 4 and 5.

Wait, no, positions 5: A4,B4,A5,B5

positions 6: B4,C4,B5,C5

positions 7: A5,B5,A6,B6 (but there is no row 6)

So, only positions 1 through 5 are valid.

Wait, positions 1: A1,B1,A2,B2

positions 2: B2,C2,B3,C3

positions 3: A3,B3,A4,B4

positions 4: B4,C4,B5,C5

positions 5: A4,B4,A5,B5

Now, if I try to place positions 1,3,4:

positions 1: A1,B1,A2,B2

positions 3: A3,B3,A4,B4

positions 4: B4,C4,B5,C5

Here, positions 3 and 4 share B4.

So, they overlap on B4.

Therefore, positions 1,3,4 cannot be used together.

Similarly, positions 1,2 overlap on B2.

Positions 2,4 overlap on B4.

Positions 3,5 overlap on A4 and B4.

Positions 4,5 overlap on B4 and B5.

So, the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 positions per screen is 2.

For example:

- positions 1 and 4

- positions 2 and 5

- positions 3

So, per screen, only two 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping.

Therefore, for y=3, you need at least two screens.

Similarly, for y=4, you'd need two screens, and for y=5, three screens, and so on.

So, the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

But wait, in the earlier test case where y=4 and x=12, the output is 2.

Let's see: y=4, x=12.

Number of cells needed: 4*4 + 12 = 28 cells.

Each screen has 15 cells, so two screens have 30 cells, which is enough.

But according to the ceil(y / 2), y=4 would require ceil(4/2)=2 screens.

But perhaps there's a better way to arrange them.

Wait, maybe with y=4, you can fit them into two screens.

Wait, but in this case, two screens can hold up to 30 cells, which is more than enough for 28 cells.

But perhaps there's a constraint on how the icons are arranged within the screens.

Wait, maybe it's not just about the total cell count but also about the arrangement of the icons.

So, perhaps I need to calculate the number of screens based on both the 2x2 icons and the 1x1 icons, considering the constraints of the grid.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons.

Each 2x2 icon requires one position, and each screen can have up to 2 non-overlapping 2x2 positions.

So, the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

Then, the remaining cells on these screens can be used for 1x1 icons.

Each screen used for 2x2 icons can accommodate up to 15 - 4*2 = 15 - 8 = 7 1x1 icons.

So, total cells available for 1x1 icons across all screens used for 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2) * 7.

If x <= ceil(y / 2) * 7, then the number of screens needed is ceil(y / 2).

Otherwise, additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

The remaining 1x1 icons would be x - ceil(y / 2) * 7.

Each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, the number of additional screens needed is ceil((x - ceil(y / 2) * 7) / 15).

Therefore, total screens needed is ceil(y / 2) + ceil((x - ceil(y / 2) * 7) / 15).

But I need to make sure that this formula works with the given test cases.

Let's take the first test case: x=1, y=1.

ceil(1 / 2) = 1 screen for 2x2 icons.

Available cells for 1x1 icons: 1 * 7 = 7.

x=1 <=7, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens: 1.

Matches the sample output.

Second test case: x=7, y=2.

ceil(2 / 2)=1 screen for 2x2 icons.

Available cells for 1x1 icons:1*7=7.

x=7 <=7, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens:1.

Matches the sample output.

Third test case: x=12, y=4.

ceil(4 / 2)=2 screens for 2x2 icons.

Available cells for 1x1 icons:2*7=14.

x=12 <=14, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens:2.

Matches the sample output.

Fourth test case: x=0, y=3.

ceil(3 / 2)=2 screens for 2x2 icons.

Available cells for 1x1 icons:2*7=14.

x=0 <=14, so no additional screens needed.

Total screens:2.

Matches the sample output.

Fifth test case: x=1, y=0.

ceil(0 / 2)=0 screens for 2x2 icons.

Available cells for 1x1 icons:0*7=0.

x=1 >0, so additional screens needed: ceil(1 / 15)=1.

Total screens:0 +1=1.

Matches the sample output.

Sixth test case: x=8, y=1.

ceil(1 / 2)=1 screen for 2x2 icons.

Available cells for 1x1 icons:1*7=7.

x=8 >7, so additional screens needed: ceil(1 / 15)=1.

Total screens:1 +1=2.

Wait, but the sample output for this test case is 1.

Wait, there must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, y=1, ceil(1 / 2)=1 screen for 2x2 icons.

Available cells for 1x1 icons:1*7=7.

x=8 >7, so additional screens needed: ceil(1 / 15)=1.

Total screens:1 +1=2.

But the sample output is 1.

So, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps my assumption about the available cells for 1x1 icons is incorrect.

Let me re-examine.

Each screen used for 2x2 icons can hold up to 2 icons of 2x2, taking up 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

But perhaps it's possible to arrange the 2x2 icons in a way that more cells are left for 1x1 icons.

Wait, in reality, each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and if two are placed without overlapping, they take 8 cells, leaving 7 for 1x1 icons.

But perhaps there's a better arrangement.

Wait, in the first screen, if I place only one 2x2 icon, it takes 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Then, for y=1 and x=8, I can place the 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons on one screen, which is more than enough for x=8.

So, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted.

Instead of ceil(y / 2), perhaps it's better to calculate the total cells needed and see how many screens are required, considering the constraints of placing 2x2 icons.

Wait, maybe I should iterate over the number of screens and see how many 2x2 icons and 1x1 icons can be placed on each screen.

Let me consider that each screen can have up to 2 2x2 icons and up to 15 - 4*number_of_2x2_icons 1x1 icons.

So, for each screen, if I place k 2x2 icons (k <=2), then it can hold up to 15 - 4k 1x1 icons.

I need to maximize the number of icons placed per screen to minimize the number of screens.

This seems like an optimization problem.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total cells needed and divide by the cells per screen, but adjust for the fact that 2x2 icons must be placed in their required positions.

Given the complexity, perhaps the initial approach is not sufficient.

Let me look at the provided program and see how it tackles the problem.

The program is:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = input().split()

a = int(a)

b = int(b)

t = b

if t % 2 == 0:

t = t // 2

else:

t = t // 2 + 1

t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

if t1 >= a:

t = t

else:

t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0:

t = t + t2 // 15

else:

t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

print(t)

So, it seems to calculate the number of screens based on the number of 2x2 icons and then adjust for the 1x1 icons.

Let's see how it works with the sample input.

First test case: x=1, y=1.

t =1

t % 2 ==1, so t =1//2 +1=1+1=2

t1 =2*15 -1*4=30-4=26

if 26 >=1: t=2

else: calculate t2=1-26= -25, but since t1 >=a, it stays t=2

But the sample output is 1, so this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back:

t = b

if t % 2 ==0:

t = t //2

else:

t = t//2 +1

So, for y=1, t=1, which is odd, so t=1//2+1=0+1=1

Then, t1 =1*15 -1*4=15-4=11

if 11 >=1: t=1

else: calculate t2=1-11=-10, which is invalid, so t=1

And output is 1, which matches the sample.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought t=2, but actually, t=1.

So, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me re-execute the code with y=1.

t =1, odd, so t=1//2+1=0+1=1

t1=1*15 -1*4=15-4=11

11 >=1, so t=1

Output:1

Correct.

Second test case: x=7, y=2

t=2, even, t=2//2=1

t1=1*15 -2*4=15-8=7

7 >=7, so t=1

Output:1

Correct.

Third test case: x=12, y=4

t=4, even, t=4//2=2

t1=2*15 -4*4=30-16=14

14 >=12, t=2

Output:2

Correct.

Fourth test case: x=0, y=3

t=3, odd, t=3//2+1=1+1=2

t1=2*15 -3*4=30-12=18

18 >=0, t=2

Output:2

Correct.

Fifth test case: x=1, y=0

t=0, even, t=0//2=0

t1=0*15 -0*4=0-0=0

0 >=1? No

t2=1-0=1

1 %15=1 !=0

t=0 +0 +1=1

Output:1

Correct.

Sixth test case: x=8, y=1

t=1, odd, t=1//2+1=0+1=1

t1=1*15 -1*4=15-4=11

11 >=8, t=1

Output:1

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 1, but earlier I thought it should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Looking back at the sample output:

1

1

2

2

1

1

0

1

1

2

5

So, for input sequence 11 lines, but earlier I only listed 10 outputs.

Wait, perhaps there's a mismatch.

Wait, the input is 11 test cases, and there are 11 outputs.

But in my earlier list, I only provided 10 test cases and their outputs.

Looking back, perhaps I need to consider all 11 test cases.

But for now, focusing on the provided program and its correctness.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for the provided test cases.

Let's see how it works.

It calculates t as ceil(y / 2), which is the minimum number of screens needed to place all y 2x2 icons, given that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.

Then, it calculates t1 = t * 15 - b * 4, which is the total available cells on t screens minus the cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.

If t1 >= a (the number of 1x1 icons), then the current t screens are sufficient.

Else, it calculates the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed, t2 = a - t1, and adds ceil(t2 / 15) to t.

This seems logical and matches the earlier reasoning.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{see the program above}} \]

**Correctness: True**
