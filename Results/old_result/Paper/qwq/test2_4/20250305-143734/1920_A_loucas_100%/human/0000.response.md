Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these n constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of possible k values is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input format. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, there's a number n indicating the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing two integers a and x, where a specifies the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and x is the value associated with that constraint.

My task is to process these constraints and count how many integer values of k satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to collect all the constraints of each type.

- For type 1 (k >= x), I need to find the maximum among these x values because k needs to be greater than or equal to all of them. So, k must be at least the maximum of these x values.

- For type 2 (k <= x), I need to find the minimum among these x values because k needs to be less than or equal to all of them. So, k must be at most the minimum of these x values.

- For type 3 (k != x), I need to exclude these specific x values from the possible k values.

So, the range of possible k values is from the maximum of type 1 constraints to the minimum of type 2 constraints, inclusive, minus the values specified in type 3 constraints.

Now, I need to calculate the number of integers in this range that are not equal to any of the type 3 constraints.

First, I'll find the lower bound of k, which is the maximum of all type 1 x values.

Then, I'll find the upper bound of k, which is the minimum of all type 2 x values.

If the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, then there are no possible k values, so the answer is 0.

Otherwise, the total number of possible k values is upper bound minus lower bound plus one, minus the number of type 3 x values that fall within this range.

I need to make sure that the type 3 x values are within the range defined by the type 1 and type 2 constraints because only those will affect the count.

So, I need to collect all type 3 x values that are >= lower bound and <= upper bound and subtract the number of such x values from the total range size.

Wait, but k cannot be equal to any of the type 3 x values within this range.

So, the total number of valid k is (upper - lower + 1) minus the number of type 3 x values that are in this range.

I need to be careful to only consider type 3 x values that are within the range [lower, upper].

Also, need to ensure that the type 3 x values are unique since no two constraints are the same, but I need to make sure there are no duplicates.

Wait, the problem says that all pairs (a, x) are distinct, so for type 3, all x values are unique.

But, in the context of the range, multiple type 3 constraints could have the same x if they have different a, but since a is fixed for each constraint, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct, then all x values across all constraints are unique.

Wait, no. Different a can have the same x. For example, (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5) are all different constraints.

But the problem says that no two constraints are the exact same, meaning no two pairs (a, x) are identical.

But for type 3, all x values are unique because if there were two type 3 constraints with the same x, say (3, 5) and (3, 5), that would violate the condition that no two constraints are the same.

Wait, but the problem says that all pairs (a, x) are distinct, so for type 3, x values are unique because a is the same (a=3).

Wait, no. If a=3 and x=5, and another a=3 and x=5, they would be the same constraint, which is disallowed.

So, for type 3, all x values are unique across all type 3 constraints.

But for different a, x can be the same.

For example, (1, 5), (2, 5), and (3, 5) are all allowed since (a, x) are distinct.

Wait, no, (1, 5), (2, 5), and (3, 5) are all different constraints because a is different.

So, in this problem, all x values can be unique or not, but all (a, x) pairs are unique.

So, for type 3, x values are unique within type 3, but x values can be shared across different a.

Wait, no, x values can be the same as long as a is different.

But in type 3, a is fixed to 3, so x values in type 3 are unique.

Wait, no, if a=3 and x=5, and another a=3 and x=5, that would be the same constraint, which is disallowed.

So, all x values in type 3 are unique.

But x values can be shared between different a.

For example, (1, 5), (2, 5), and (3, 6) are allowed because all (a, x) pairs are unique.

So, in summary, for type 3, x values are unique.

This simplifies things because I don't have to worry about duplicate x values in type 3.

Now, back to the approach.

Find the lower bound as the maximum of all type 1 x values.

Find the upper bound as the minimum of all type 2 x values.

If lower > upper, then no possible k, so answer is 0.

Else, total possible k is (upper - lower + 1).

Then, subtract the number of type 3 x values that are in the range [lower, upper].

So, I need to count how many type 3 x values are within [lower, upper].

Since type 3 x values are unique, I can just check how many of them are >= lower and <= upper.

Finally, the answer is (upper - lower + 1) minus the count of type 3 x values in [lower, upper].

I need to make sure that I handle the cases where there are no type 3 constraints, in which case the answer is just (upper - lower + 1).

Also, if the range is empty (lower > upper), answer is 0, regardless of type 3 constraints.

Let me think about the sample input.

First sample input:

6

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, n=4.

Constraints:

- k >= 3

- k <= 10

- k != 1

- k != 5

So, range is from 3 to 10, inclusive: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But k != 1 and k != 5.

But 1 is not in the range, so only k=5 is excluded.

So, possible k: 3,4,6,7,8,9,10 → 7 values.

Which matches the sample output.

Second sample input:

2

1 5

2 4

So, n=2.

Constraints:

- k >= 5

- k <= 4

This is impossible, so answer is 0.

Third sample input:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

So, n=10.

Constraints:

- k >= 2

- k >= 7

- k >= 3 → maximum of these is k >= 7

- k <= 100

- k <= 98 → minimum of these is k <= 98

- k != 6,7,100,44,99

So, range is from 7 to 98, inclusive.

Exclude k=6,7,100,44,99.

But 6 is below the range, 100 is above the range, 99 is within the range.

So, exclude k=7,44,99.

Total possible k: 98 - 7 + 1 = 92.

Subtract 3 (for k=7,44,99), so 92 - 3 = 89.

But the sample output is 90, so maybe I miscounted.

Wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait, in the sample output, it's 90, but according to my calculation, it's 89.

Wait, let me check again.

Range is from 7 to 98, inclusive.

Total numbers: 98 - 7 + 1 = 92.

Exclude k=7,44,99.

But k=99 is within the range, so 92 - 3 = 89.

But sample output is 90.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output.

Wait, no, sample output for this test case is 90.

So, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe k=6 is not in the range, so only exclude k=7,44,99.

But 6 is not in the range, so only exclude k=7,44,99.

Wait, but 99 is in the range, so 92 - 3 = 89.

But sample output is 90.

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the sample input.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Wait, looking back, the third test case has 10 constraints:

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

So, type 1: k >= 2, k >= 7, k >= 3 → max is k >= 7

Type 2: k <= 100, k <= 98 → min is k <= 98

Type 3: k != 6,7,100,44,99

So, range is 7 to 98, inclusive.

Exclude k=7,44,99.

Total numbers: 98 - 7 + 1 = 92.

Exclude 3 values: 92 - 3 = 89.

But sample output is 90.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the exclusions.

Wait, k=6 is not in the range, so only exclude k=7,44,99.

But 7 is in the range, 44 is in the range, 99 is in the range.

So, 92 - 3 = 89.

But sample output is 90.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the sample output or my understanding.

Wait, perhaps k=99 is not in the range.

Wait, k=99 is greater than 98, so it's not in the range.

So, only exclude k=7 and k=44.

So, 92 - 2 = 90.

Ah, that makes sense.

I mistakenly thought k=99 was in the range, but it's not.

k=99 is greater than the upper bound of 98, so it's not in the range.

Therefore, only exclude k=7 and k=44.

Hence, 92 - 2 = 90.

Okay, that matches the sample output.

So, my approach seems correct now.

Therefore, in code, I need to:

- Collect all type 1 x values and take the maximum.

- Collect all type 2 x values and take the minimum.

- Collect all type 3 x values.

- Compute the range size as upper - lower + 1.

- Count how many type 3 x values are within the range [lower, upper].

- Subtract that count from the range size.

- If lower > upper, the range size is 0.

Edge cases to consider:

- Range is empty: lower > upper → answer is 0.

- Range has only one value, and it's excluded by type 3 → answer is 0.

- Range has multiple values, some excluded by type 3.

- All type 3 x values are outside the range → answer is upper - lower + 1.

- All type 3 x values are within the range.

- type 3 x values equal to lower or upper.

I need to make sure that the code handles these cases correctly.

Also, need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 100 and t up to 500, it's manageable.

I need to read input correctly, making sure that for each test case, I read n lines of constraints.

In terms of implementation, I can use lists to store the x values for each type of constraint.

Then, find the maximum of type 1, minimum of type 2, and collect all type 3 x values.

Then, compute the range size, and count how many type 3 x values are within the range.

Finally, subtract that count from the range size.

Let me look at the provided program and see if it follows this logic.

Looking at the code:

def func():

loop = int(input())

for iterable in range(loop):

less = []

big = []

no = []

num = 0

innerLoop = int(input())

for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):

(x, a) = map(int, input().split())

if x == 1:

big.append(a)

elif x == 2:

less.append(a)

else:

no.append(a)

num = min(less) - max(big) + 1

if num < 1:

print(0)

continue

for i in no:

if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):

num -= 1

print(num)

So, it seems to follow the logic I described.

It separates the constraints into three lists: big for type 1, less for type 2, and no for type 3.

Then, it computes num as min(less) - max(big) + 1, which is the range size.

If num < 1, it prints 0.

Otherwise, it iterates through the type 3 x values and subtracts 1 for each that is within the range.

Finally, it prints num.

This seems correct.

In the third test case, lower = max(big) = max([2,7,3]) = 7

upper = min(less) = min([100,98]) = 98

num = 98 - 7 + 1 = 92

Then, type 3 x values are [6,7,100,44,99]

Among these, 7 and 44 are within [7,98], so num -= 2 → 92 - 2 = 90, which matches the sample output.

Looks good.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\texttt{True}} \]
