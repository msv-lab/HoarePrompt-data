Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers doesn't have matching bit values from the 1st to the 31st bit. Basically, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, those bits shouldn't be the same.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. Let's think about binary representations. Each number is represented by up to 31 bits, from the least significant bit (LSB) to the 31st bit. The condition says that for any two numbers in the same group, for each of these 31 bits, the bits shouldn't be equal. That means, for each bit position, the bits of the two numbers should differ.

Wait a minute, that sounds a lot like orthogonality in vector spaces, but in the context of binary numbers. In other words, for two numbers to be in the same group, their binary representations should differ in all 31 bit positions.

But hold on, if two numbers differ in all 31 bit positions, that means that for each bit, one has a 0 and the other has a 1. So, essentially, the two numbers are complements of each other, right? Because if they differ in every bit, then one is the bitwise NOT of the other.

Let me confirm that. If I have a number x and its complement is ~x (which is x XOR (2^31 - 1), since 2^31 - 1 is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1). So, x and ~x would differ in all 31 bit positions.

But the problem says "any pair of numbers" in the same group should have differing bits in all 31 positions. So, in a group, every pair should consist of numbers that are complements of each other.

Wait, but that can't be right because if I have more than two numbers in a group, say three numbers, then every pair among them should be complements. But if a is the complement of b, and b is the complement of c, then a should be the same as c, which would mean a and c have the same bits, which violates the condition. So, it's impossible to have more than two numbers in a group where every pair is composed of complements.

Wait, no. If a is the complement of b, and b is the complement of c, then a should be the same as c. But if a and c are the same, then a and c would have the same bits, which violates the condition that they should differ in all bit positions. So, it's impossible to have a group with three numbers where every pair is composed of complements.

Therefore, the maximum group size is two, consisting of two numbers that are complements of each other.

So, the problem reduces to pairing numbers that are complements of each other, and any number that doesn't have its complement in the list will have to be in its own group.

Therefore, the minimum number of groups required is equal to the number of singletons (numbers without their complements present) plus half the number of pairs (since each pair consists of two numbers).

Wait, but in terms of code, how do I implement this efficiently, especially considering the constraints: t test cases, each with up to 2*10^5 numbers, and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

So, time complexity needs to be efficient.

I need to group numbers into pairs where each pair consists of a number and its complement. Any number without a complement will be in its own group.

So, the minimum number of groups is equal to the number of such pairs plus the number of singletons.

Wait, no. Actually, since each pair consists of two numbers, and each singleton is one group, the total number of groups is equal to the number of singletons plus the number of pairs.

But, in terms of minimizing the number of groups, I need to maximize the number of pairs, because each pair reduces the number of groups by one compared to having two singletons.

Wait, let's think carefully.

If I have two numbers that are complements, I can put them in one group, whereas if I have two singletons, they would require two groups. So, for every pair of complements, I save one group compared to if I had to treat them as two singletons.

So, to minimize the number of groups, I need to maximize the number of such pairs.

Therefore, the minimum number of groups is equal to the total number of numbers minus the number of pairs, which is equivalent to the number of singletons plus the number of pairs.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's formalize it.

Let p be the number of pairs, and s be the number of singletons.

Total number of numbers n = 2p + s.

The number of groups g = p (for the pairs) + s (for the singletons).

But I can write s = n - 2p, so g = p + (n - 2p) = n - p.

So, to minimize g, I need to maximize p, the number of pairs.

Therefore, the minimum number of groups is n - p, where p is the maximum number of pairs I can form.

But in this problem, p is limited by the number of complement pairs present in the input.

So, to compute p, I need to count how many pairs of complements exist in the input.

Given that, the minimum number of groups is n - p.

Wait, but in the example, for the first test case:

4

1 4 3 4

Let's compute the complements.

Assuming 31-bit numbers, the complement of 1 is (2^31 -1) -1 = 2^31 -2.

Similarly, complement of 4 is (2^31 -1) -4 = 2^31 -5.

Complement of 3 is 2^31 -4.

Complement of 4 is again 2^31 -5.

Now, in this case, none of these complements are present in the list, so p=0, and g=n -p =4 -0=4, which matches the first output.

In the second test case:

2

0 2147483647

2147483647 is 2^31 -1, which is the complement of 0, so p=1, g=2 -1=1, which matches the second output.

In the third test case:

5

476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767

Let's see, 2136179468 is the complement of 476319172, because 2136179468 + 476319172 = 2^31 -1.

Similarly, 1671164475 is the complement of 261956880, because 1671164475 + 261956880 = 2^31 -1.

And 1885526767 doesn't have its complement in the list.

So, p=2, s=1, g=3, which matches the third output.

So, this seems correct.

Therefore, the strategy is:

- For each number, find its complement.

- Count the number of such pairs.

- The minimum number of groups is n - p, where p is the number of pairs.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=5, p=2, g=3, which matches.

In the first test case, n=4, p=0, g=4, matches.

In the second test case, n=2, p=1, g=1, matches.

Seems correct.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, we need an efficient way to count the number of pairs.

I can use a dictionary to count the frequency of each number and its complement.

For each number, compute its complement, and check if the complement has been seen before.

If yes, form a pair and decrement the count of the complement in the dictionary.

If not, add the number to the dictionary.

Wait, but I need to handle multiple pairs.

Let me think in terms of pairing numbers with their complements.

Initialize an empty dictionary.

For each number in the input:

Compute its complement.

If the complement is in the dictionary and has a count greater than 0:

Form a pair, decrement the count of the complement, and increment p.

Else:

Add the number to the dictionary, increment its count.

At the end, s = n - 2p, and g = p + s = n - p.

So, I need to keep track of the counts.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be doing something similar.

Let me look at the given code.

def func():

times = int(input())

check = 2 ** 31 - 1

for _ in range(times):

n = int(input())

data = list(map(int, input().split()))

dic = dict()

ans = n

check = 2 ** 31 - 1

for i in data:

s = i ^ check

if s in dic:

dic[s] -= 1

ans -= 1

if dic[s] == 0:

del dic[s]

elif i in dic:

dic[i] += 1

else:

dic[i] = 1

print(ans)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the list of numbers.

It initializes a dictionary and ans = n.

check is set to 2^31 -1.

For each number i in the data:

s = i XOR check, which is the complement of i.

If s is in dic:

dic[s] -=1

ans -=1

if dic[s] ==0:

del dic[s]

elif i is in dic:

dic[i] +=1

else:

dic[i] =1

Then print ans.

So, it's trying to keep track of complements.

Let me see how this works.

For each number i:

- Compute its complement s = i XOR check.

- If s is in dic, meaning its complement is already seen, so we can pair them, decrement the count of s, and decrement ans by 1 (since this pair reduces the number of groups by 1).

- If s is in dic and after decrementing its count, if it becomes 0, remove it from the dictionary.

- If s is not in dic, then check if i is in dic. If i is in dic, increment its count.

- If neither s nor i is in dic, add i to dic with count 1.

This seems to be correctly implementing the pairing strategy.

In the first test case:

4

1 4 3 4

check = 2^31 -1.

Compute complements:

1 ^ check = complement of 1.

4 ^ check = complement of 4.

3 ^ check = complement of 3.

4 ^ check = complement of 4.

None of these complements are present initially, so:

- For 1: complement not in dic, so add 1 to dic, dic={1:1}

- For 4: complement not in dic, so add 4 to dic, dic={1:1, 4:1}

- For 3: complement not in dic, so add 3 to dic, dic={1:1, 4:1, 3:1}

- For 4: complement not in dic, so add 4 to dic, dic={1:1, 4:2, 3:1}

ans remains 4.

So, output is 4, which matches the first test case.

In the second test case:

2

0 2147483647

check = 2^31 -1.

Complement of 0 is 2147483647.

Complement of 2147483647 is 0.

So:

- For 0: complement is 2147483647, which is not in dic, so add 0 to dic, dic={0:1}

- For 2147483647: complement is 0, which is in dic, so dic[0] -=1, ans -=1 (ans=2-1=1), and since dic[0]=0, del dic[0]

So, final ans is 1, which matches the second test case.

In the third test case:

5

476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767

Let's compute complements:

- 476319172 ^ check = 2136179468

- 261956880 ^ check = 1671164475

- 2136179468 ^ check = 476319172

- 1671164475 ^ check = 261956880

- 1885526767 ^ check = some value not present in the list.

So:

- For 476319172: complement is 2136179468, not in dic, so add 476319172:1

- For 261956880: complement is 1671164475, not in dic, so add 261956880:1

- For 2136179468: complement is 476319172, which is in dic, so dic[476319172] -=1, ans -=1 (ans=5-1=4), and since dic[476319172]=0, del dic[476319172]

- For 1671164475: complement is 261956880, which is in dic, so dic[261956880] -=1, ans -=1 (ans=4-1=3), and since dic[261956880]=0, del dic[261956880]

- For 1885526767: complement not in dic, so add 1885526767:1

Final ans is 3, which matches the third test case.

So, the code seems to be correctly implementing the logic to minimize the number of groups.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
