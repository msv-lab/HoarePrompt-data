Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about determining who wins in a game between Anna and Sasha based on a list of integers and some parameters. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

So, the game is played with a list of n integers, and there are two players: Anna and Sasha. They take turns, with Anna going first. The game ends when there's only one number left in the list, and based on the value of that number compared to 10^m, we decide who wins.

Let me clarify the moves:

- Anna's move: She chooses one element from the list, reverses its digits, and updates the list with this new number. Leading zeros are removed after reversal.

- Sasha's move: He chooses two different elements from the list, concatenates them in any order, removes them from the list, and inserts the concatenated number back into the list.

The game continues until only one number remains. If this number is greater than or equal to 10^m, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

I need to determine, for multiple test cases, who wins if both players play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics and how the list evolves with each move.

Let's consider the number of elements in the list:

- Initially, there are n elements.

- Each of Sasha's moves reduces the number of elements by 1 (since he removes two and adds one).

- Anna's moves don't change the number of elements.

So, the number of Sasha's moves is limited by the number of elements available to concatenate.

Let me denote the number of Sasha's possible moves as s. Since he needs to choose two different elements each time, the maximum number of times he can play is floor(n/2).

Wait, actually, it's a bit more nuanced because after each of Sasha's moves, the number of elements decreases by 1, so the number of possible Sasha's moves is floor(n/2), assuming n is even, or floor((n-1)/2) if n is odd.

But more precisely, the game alternates between Anna and Sasha, with Anna starting. The game ends when there's only one element left.

Let me think about the total number of moves:

- Each complete turn (Anna and Sasha) reduces the number of elements by 1 (since Sasha removes two and adds one, and Anna doesn't change the count).

- Starting from n elements, the number of complete turns possible is n - 1.

- Since Anna starts, she will have ceil((n - 1)/2) moves, and Sasha will have floor((n - 1)/2).

Wait, perhaps I need to model the game more carefully.

Let me consider the sequence of moves:

1. Anna reverses one number.

2. Sasha concatenates two numbers into one.

3. Anna reverses one number.

4. Sasha concatenates two numbers into one.

And so on, until only one number remains.

Wait, but Sasha can only concatenate if there are at least two numbers in the list.

So, the game proceeds as follows:

- While there is more than one number in the list:

- Anna reverses one number.

- If there are still at least two numbers, Sasha concatenates two into one.

- Repeat.

- When only one number remains, check if it's >= 10^m to decide the winner.

So, the sequence of moves depends on the number of elements available.

Let me try to simulate this process with small examples to see the pattern.

Take the first test case from the example:

2 2

14 2

Anna reverses one number. Options:

- Reverse 14 to 41

- Reverse 2 to 2

So, possible lists after Anna's move:

- [41, 2]

- [14, 2]

Wait, reversing 2 is still 2.

Then Sasha concatenates two numbers:

- From [41, 2]: can concatenate to 412 or 241.

- From [14, 2]: can concatenate to 142 or 214.

Both 412 and 214 are greater than 100 (which is 10^2), so Sasha wins in both cases.

Hence, Sasha wins.

Another test case:

3 5

9 56 1

Anna reverses one number:

Options:

- Reverse 9 to 9

- Reverse 56 to 65

- Reverse 1 to 1

So possible lists after Anna's move:

- [9,56,1]

- [65,56,1]

- [9,56,1]

Wait, reversing 9 is still 9, and reversing 1 is still 1.

Then Sasha concatenates two numbers:

From [9,56,1]:

Possible concatenations:

- 9 and 56: result in 956 or 569

- 9 and 1: result in 91 or 19

- 56 and 1: result in 561 or 156

Similarly for [65,56,1]:

Possible concatenations:

- 65 and 56: 6556 or 5665

- 65 and 1: 651 or 165

- 56 and 1: 561 or 156

After Sasha's move, the list has two elements again, and Anna reverses one, and so on.

This seems complicated to simulate directly.

I need a better approach.

Looking at the provided code:

def func_1(n, m, nums):

tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))

cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)

for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):

tot -= cntvals[i]

return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

def zerocnts(num):

num = str(num)

tot = 0

for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):

if num[i] != '0':

break

tot += 1

return tot

So, it's calculating the total number of digits in all numbers, and then subtracting the trailing zeros from every second number (starting from the one with the most trailing zeros).

If the resulting total is greater than or equal to m + 1, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First, let's understand what trailing zeros mean in this context.

Trailing zeros in a number are the zeros at the end of the number. For example, in 100, there are two trailing zeros.

But in the reversal operation, leading zeros are removed, so reversing 100 gives 001, which becomes 1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says leading zeros are removed after reversal.

So, reversing 100 gives 001, which is 1.

Similarly, reversing 10 gives 01, which is 1.

Reversing 1000 gives 0001, which is 1.

Reversing 123 gives 321.

Reversing 120 gives 021, which is 21.

So, reversing a number can significantly change its value, especially if it has trailing zeros.

But in the code provided, it's considering the trailing zeros in the original numbers and using that to compute some total.

I need to see if this relates to the final number after the game.

Let me think about the game ending condition.

The game ends when there's only one number left, and if that number is >= 10^m, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

So, I need to determine the final number after a series of Anna's and Sasha's moves and see if it's >= 10^m.

But simulating the entire game for large n is not feasible due to time constraints.

Hence, I need a mathematical way to determine the final number's magnitude.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be calculating some kind of total digit count, adjusted by the trailing zeros in some numbers.

I need to verify if this correctly predicts the winner.

Let me consider some test cases.

Take the first test case:

2 2

14 2

According to the code:

n=2, m=2

nums=[14,2]

tot = len('14') + len('2') = 2 + 1 = 3

cntvals = [zerocnts(14), zerocnts(2)] = [0, 0]

sorted cntvals reverse: [0,0]

subtract cntvals[0] = 0 from tot: 3 - 0 = 3

Check if 3 >= 2 + 1 => 3 >= 3, which is True, so 'Sasha'

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

3 5

9 56 1

tot = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

cntvals = [0, 0, 0] (since none have trailing zeros)

sorted reverse: [0,0,0]

subtract cntvals[0] and cntvals[2]: 4 - 0 - 0 = 4

Check 4 >= 5 + 1 => 4 >= 6, False, so 'Anna'

Which matches the sample output.

Third test case:

4 10

1 2007 800 1580

tot = 1 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 12

cntvals = [0, 0, 2, 1] (1 has 0, 2007 has 0, 800 has 2, 1580 has 1)

sorted reverse: [2,1,0,0]

subtract cntvals[0] and cntvals[2]: 12 - 2 - 0 = 10

Check 10 >= 10 + 1 => 10 >= 11, False, so 'Anna'

Which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 'Anna' for this case.

Wait, no, looking back, the sample output is:

Sasha

Anna

Anna

Sasha

Sasha

Anna

Anna

Anna

Sasha

Wait, for the third test case, which is n=4, m=10, nums=[1,2007,800,1580], output is 'Anna'

But according to the code, it's 'Anna', which matches.

Wait, but in my calculation, 12 - 2 - 0 = 10, and 10 >= 11 is False, so 'Anna'

Yes, correct.

Another test case:

1 1

6

tot = 1

cntvals = [0]

subtract cntvals[0] = 0, so tot = 1

Check 1 >= 1 + 1 => 1 >= 2, False, so 'Anna'

Which matches the sample output.

Wait, but in the sample input, for t=9, the outputs are:

Sasha

Anna

Anna

Sasha

Sasha

Anna

Anna

Anna

Sasha

But for t=6:

1 1

6

Output: Anna

Which matches.

Wait, I need to make sure I'm looking at the correct test case.

Moving on.

I need to understand the logic behind the code.

It seems to be calculating the total number of digits in all numbers, and then subtracting the trailing zeros from every second number (starting from the one with the most trailing zeros).

Then, if the adjusted total digits is greater than or equal to m + 1, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

I need to see why this works.

First, let's consider what trailing zeros mean in the context of reversing numbers.

As established earlier, reversing a number with trailing zeros results in a smaller number because leading zeros are removed.

For example:

- 100 reverses to 001 -> 1

- 2007 reverses to 7002

- 800 reverses to 008 -> 8

- 1580 reverses to 0851 -> 851

So, Anna can choose to reverse numbers to either keep them the same or make them smaller, depending on whether they have trailing zeros.

Sasha, on the other hand, concatenates two numbers, which always results in a larger number.

The goal is to make the final number as large as possible (for Sasha to win) or as small as possible (for Anna to win).

Given that Sasha wants the final number to be large, and Anna wants it to be small, their moves reflect that:

- Anna reverses a number, possibly reducing it if it has trailing zeros.

- Sasha concatenates two numbers, increasing the number of digits and thus the potential magnitude.

The key is to analyze how the number of digits affects the final number's magnitude.

In general, a number with more digits is larger than one with fewer digits, assuming the most significant digits are not zero.

However, since Anna can reverse numbers and potentially reduce their digit count (by removing trailing zeros), she can affect the final digit count.

The provided code seems to calculate the total number of digits, adjusted by the trailing zeros that Anna can exploit.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s define:

- Initial total digit count: sum of the number of digits in all numbers.

- Trailing zeros: for each number, count the trailing zeros.

- Anna can choose to reverse numbers with trailing zeros to reduce their digit count.

- Specifically, reversing a number with t trailing zeros reduces its digit count by t.

- For example, 100 (3 digits, 2 trailing zeros) reverses to 1 (1 digit), a reduction of 2 digits.

So, Anna can choose to reduce the digit count of some numbers by reversing them.

The question is, can Anna reduce the digit count enough so that the final number has fewer than m digits?

Or, equivalently, is the maximum possible digit count after all moves less than m?

Wait, but the condition is that the final number must be >= 10^m for Sasha to win.

So, if the final number has at least m digits, it's >= 10^m.

Hence, Sasha wants the final number to have at least m digits, and Anna wants it to have fewer than m digits.

Given that, I need to determine if, after all moves, the final number will have at least m digits or not.

Now, let's think about how the digit count changes during the game.

- Anna can choose to reverse some numbers, potentially reducing their digit count by removing trailing zeros.

- Sasha concatenates two numbers into one, which increases the digit count by the sum of their digit counts.

Wait, actually, concatenating two numbers with d1 and d2 digits results in a number with d1 + d2 digits.

So, each of Sasha's moves increases the total digit count by the sum of the digits of the two numbers he concatenates, but since he removes those two and adds one, the net effect on the total digit count is zero.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Initially, total digit count is sum of digits of all numbers.

After Sasha concatenates two numbers with d1 and d2 digits into one number with d1 + d2 digits, he removes the two numbers and adds one, so the total digit count remains the same: (sum - d1 - d2 + d1 + d2) = sum.

Hence, Sasha's moves don't change the total digit count.

Anna's moves, however, can reduce the digit count if she reverses numbers with trailing zeros.

Therefore, the total digit count can only decrease or stay the same due to Anna's moves.

Sasha's moves don't affect the total digit count.

The final number's digit count will be equal to the initial total digit count minus the total reduction from Anna's moves.

Anna will try to maximize the reduction to minimize the final digit count, while Sasha wants to minimize the reduction to maximize the final digit count.

Hence, the final digit count depends on how much Anna can reduce the total digit count by reversing numbers with trailing zeros.

So, the minimal final digit count is the initial total digit count minus the sum of trailing zeros that Anna can exploit.

Anna can choose which numbers to reverse, and she can reverse any subset of the numbers.

But since she moves first and then alternates with Sasha, she can choose to reverse the numbers with the most trailing zeros to maximize the reduction.

Wait, but in the provided code, it sorts the trailing zeros in reverse order and subtracts every second one.

Wait, in the code:

cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)

for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):

tot -= cntvals[i]

So, it's sorting the trailing zeros in descending order and subtracting every second one starting from the first.

I need to understand why.

Let me consider that Anna and Sasha alternate moves, with Anna starting.

Anna can choose to reverse the number with the most trailing zeros, then Sasha can reverse the next one, and so on.

But actually, Sasha doesn't reverse numbers; he concatenates them.

Wait, no, Sasha doesn't reverse numbers; he concatenates them.

So, Anna is the only one who can reduce the digit count by reversing numbers with trailing zeros.

Hence, Anna will choose to reverse the numbers with the most trailing zeros to maximize the reduction.

So, she should reverse the numbers with the highest trailing zeros first.

But in the code, it's sorting the trailing zeros in descending order and subtracting every second one.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps it's considering that Anna can reverse half of the numbers, selecting those with the most trailing zeros.

But actually, since Anna moves first and then alternates with Sasha, the number of moves Anna has depends on the number of elements and the sequence of moves.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of game theory.

This seems like a combinatorial game where Anna and Sasha make alternating moves, and the game ends when only one number remains.

To determine who wins, we need to see who can force the final number to be >= 10^m.

Given that, perhaps the code is implementing some kind of strategy where Anna can reduce the digit count by reversing numbers with trailing zeros, and Sasha tries to maximize the digit count by concatenating numbers without reducing the digit count.

But I'm not fully grasping why the code subtracts every second highest trailing zero count.

Let me consider a simple case.

Suppose n=1.

Then, no Sasha moves; Anna reverses the single number.

If reversing it reduces its digit count, Anna wins; otherwise, it depends on the number.

Wait, according to the code:

n=1, m=something

tot = len(str(num1))

cntvals = [zerocnts(num1)]

sorted reverse: [zerocnts(num1)]

subtract cntvals[0] (since i=0 is 0)

tot -= cntvals[0]

check if tot >= m + 1

Wait, but in reality, with n=1, Anna reverses the only number, and then the game ends.

So, the final number is the reversed number.

The code seems to be considering that Anna can reduce the digit count by zerocnts(num1), so tot -= cntvals[0]

Then, check if tot >= m + 1

This seems plausible for n=1.

Now, for n=2:

Anna reverses one number, then Sasha concatenates the two numbers.

Anna can choose which number to reverse to minimize the final number.

But in the code, for n=2, it's tot = sum of digits of both numbers, then subtract cntvals[0], which is the highest trailing zeros among the two.

So, tot -= max trailing zeros.

Then check if tot >= m + 1

Wait, in the first test case:

n=2, m=2

nums=[14,2]

tot = 2 + 1 = 3

cntvals = [0,0]

sorted reverse: [0,0]

subtract cntvals[0]=0

tot = 3 - 0 = 3

check 3 >= 2 + 1 => 3 >= 3, which is True, so 'Sasha'

Which matches the sample.

Another test case:

n=1, m=1

nums=[6]

tot = 1

cntvals=[0]

subtract 0

tot = 1

check 1 >= 1 + 1 => 1 >= 2, False, so 'Anna'

Which matches the sample.

Wait, but in another test case:

n=4, m=10

nums=[1,2007,800,1580]

tot = 1 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 12

cntvals = [0,0,2,1] (from 1,2007,800,1580)

sorted reverse: [2,1,0,0]

subtract cntvals[0]=2 and cntvals[2]=0

tot = 12 - 2 - 0 = 10

check 10 >= 10 + 1 => 10 >= 11, False, so 'Anna'

Which matches the sample.

Wait, but in this case, Anna can reverse numbers with trailing zeros, like 800 and 1580.

Reversing 800 removes two trailing zeros, reducing its digit count by 2 (from 3 to 1).

Reversing 1580 removes one trailing zero, reducing its digit count by 1 (from 4 to 3).

So, if Anna reverses both, tot = 1 (from 1) + 4 (from 2007) + 1 (from 800 reversed) + 3 (from 1580 reversed) = 9

But according to the code, it's subtracting only every second highest trailing zeros.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the code is implementing some kind of game theory strategy where Anna can subtract the trailing zeros from her moves, and Sasha's moves don't allow Anna to subtract more.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me consider that Anna can reverse up to ceil(n/2) numbers, choosing those with the most trailing zeros to maximize reduction.

But in the code, it's subtracting every second one in the sorted list.

Wait, perhaps it's considering that Anna and Sasha alternate moves, and Anna gets to choose which numbers to reverse, but in a way that's every second one in the sorted list.

I think I need to look for a better approach.

Let me consider that the final digit count is equal to the initial total digit count minus the sum of trailing zeros that Anna can exploit.

Anna wants to minimize the final digit count, so she will try to reduce it as much as possible.

Sasha wants to maximize the final digit count.

Given that Anna moves first, and they alternate, the question is how much Anna can reduce the digit count.

In combinatorial game theory, this seems like a subtraction game where Anna can subtract the trailing zeros from some numbers.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

An alternative approach is to note that Sasha's moves don't change the total digit count, while Anna's moves can reduce it.

Hence, the minimal final digit count is the initial total digit count minus the sum of trailing zeros that Anna can exploit.

If this minimal final digit count is >= m + 1, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

So, the question is, how much can Anna reduce the digit count?

Assuming Anna plays optimally to minimize the final digit count, she will choose to reverse the numbers with the most trailing zeros.

Hence, the minimal final digit count is initial total digit count minus the sum of the trailing zeros of all numbers.

But wait, no. She can only reverse some of the numbers, not all.

Wait, actually, in the game, Anna can reverse any number in her turn, and there are ceil(n/2) turns for Anna.

Wait, more precisely:

- Total moves: n - 1 (since each complete turn reduces the number of elements by 1)

- Anna moves ceil((n - 1)/2)

- Sasha moves floor((n - 1)/2)

But in reality, Anna moves first, then Sasha, alternating until only one element remains.

Hence, the number of Anna's moves is ceil((n - 1)/2), and Sasha's moves are floor((n - 1)/2)

So, Anna can reverse up to ceil((n - 1)/2) numbers.

Wait, but in the code, it's subtracting cntvals[i] for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2)

Which is every second element starting from 0, assuming cntvals is sorted in reverse.

This seems like Anna is subtracting the trailing zeros from every other number starting from the one with the most trailing zeros.

I'm still not fully understanding why.

Let me consider a small example.

n=3, m=5

nums=[9,56,1]

tot = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

cntvals = [0,0,0]

sorted reverse: [0,0,0]

subtract cntvals[0]=0 and cntvals[2]=0

tot -= 0 + 0 = 4 - 0 = 4

check 4 >= 5 + 1 => 4 >= 6, False, so 'Anna'

Which matches the sample.

Another example:

n=4, m=10

nums=[1,2007,800,1580]

tot=1+4+3+4=12

cntvals=[0,0,2,1]

sorted reverse: [2,1,0,0]

subtract cntvals[0]=2 and cntvals[2]=0

tot=12 - 2 - 0 =10

check 10 >= 10 +1 => 10 >=11, False, so 'Anna'

Which matches the sample.

Wait, but in this case, Anna can reverse numbers with trailing zeros: 800 and 1580.

By reversing them, she reduces the digit count by 2 and 1, respectively.

So, total reduction is 3, making tot=12-3=9

But according to the code, it's only subtracting 2 + 0=2, making tot=12-2=10

Which is different from what I thought.

Wait, perhaps the code is considering that Anna can only reverse a certain number of numbers, not all of them.

Given that Anna has ceil((n-1)/2) moves, in n=4, ceil((4-1)/2)=2 moves.

Hence, she can reverse 2 numbers.

So, she会选择to reverse the numbers with the most trailing zeros, which are 800 (2 trailing zeros) and 1580 (1 trailing zero).

Hence, total reduction is 2 + 1 =3

But according to the code, it's subtracting cntvals[0] and cntvals[2], which are 2 and 0, totaling 2.

Which is not matching my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of moves Anna has.

Wait, for n=4:

Total moves: n-1=3

Anna moves ceil(3/2)=2 times

Sasha moves floor(3/2)=1 time

Hence, Anna can reverse 2 numbers.

So, she should choose to reverse the numbers with the most trailing zeros, which are 800 (2) and 1580 (1), totaling 3.

But according to the code, it's subtracting cntvals[0] and cntvals[2], which are 2 and 0, totaling 2.

Which is less than 3.

Hence, the code is underestimating the reduction Anna can make.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.

Looking back:

for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):

tot -= cntvals[i]

So, for n=4, len(cntvals)=4

i=0: subtract cntvals[0]=2

i=2: subtract cntvals[2]=0

Hence, total subtraction=2+0=2

But Anna can reverse 2 numbers, so she should be able to subtract 2+1=3

Hence, the code is incorrect here.

Wait, perhaps the code is assuming that Anna can only choose to reverse every second number in the sorted list.

Which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the game as a Nim game or something similar, where the subtracted values are XORed or something.

But I don't think so.

I think the code is flawed in this aspect.

Let me consider another approach.

Perhaps the minimal final digit count is the total digit count minus the sum of trailing zeros of the numbers Anna chooses to reverse, and she can choose up to ceil((n-1)/2) numbers to reverse.

Hence, to minimize the final digit count, she should choose to reverse the numbers with the highest trailing zeros.

Hence, the minimal final digit count is total_digit_count - sum of the top ceil((n-1)/2) trailing zeros.

Then, if this minimal final digit count >= m + 1, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

Hence, in the earlier example with n=4, m=10, nums=[1,2007,800,1580]

ceil((4-1)/2)=2

sum of top 2 trailing zeros: 2 (from 800) +1 (from 1580)=3

tot=12-3=9

9 >= 11? No, so 'Anna'

Which matches the sample output.

But in the code, it's subtracting cntvals[0] and cntvals[2], which are 2 and 0, totaling 2, giving tot=12-2=10, which is >=11? No, so 'Anna'

Which coincides with the correct answer, but only by coincidence.

In reality, Anna can reduce the digit count by 3, not 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in this case, it still gives the correct answer because 12-2=10 <11, so 'Anna', which is correct.

But if m=9, then 12-2=10 >=10, so 'Sasha', but actually, Anna can reduce by 3, making 12-3=9 <10, so 'Anna'

Hence, the code would give the wrong answer in this case.

Hence, the code is flawed.

I think the correct approach is:

- Calculate the total digit count.

- Determine how many numbers Anna can reverse (ceil((n-1)/2)).

- Sort the trailing zeros in descending order.

- Subtract the sum of the top ceil((n-1)/2)) trailing zeros from the total digit count.

- If the result >= m +1, Sasha wins; else, Anna wins.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect because it subtracts every second trailing zero in the sorted list, which doesn't correspond to Anna's optimal strategy.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game played between Anna and Sasha based on a list of integers and given parameters. The game involves reversing and concatenating numbers, and the winner is decided based on the final number's magnitude.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - **Anna's Move**: Reverses one number in the list, removing leading zeros.
   - **Sasha's Move**: Concatenates two numbers into one, reducing the list size by one.
   - The game ends when only one number remains. If this number is not less than \(10^m\), Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Insight**:
   - The total number of digits in the list can help determine the final number's magnitude.
   - Anna can reduce the total digit count by reversing numbers with trailing zeros.
   - Sasha aims to maximize the digit count through concatenation.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Calculate the initial total digit count.
   - Determine how much Anna can reduce this digit count by reversing numbers with trailing zeros.
   - Check if the resulting digit count is sufficient to make the final number >= \(10^m\).

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the total digit count of all numbers.
   - Count the trailing zeros in each number.
   - Sort these trailing zeros in descending order.
   - Subtract the sum of the top `ceil((n-1)/2)` trailing zeros from the total digit count.
   - Compare the result with `m + 1` to decide the winner.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def func_1(n, m, nums):
    # Calculate total digit count
    tot = sum(len(str(num)) for num in nums)
    
    # Calculate trailing zeros for each number
    trailing_zeros = [count_trailing_zeros(num) for num in nums]
    
    # Sort trailing zeros in descending order
    trailing_zeros_sorted = sorted(trailing_zeros, reverse=True)
    
    # Determine how many numbers Anna can reverse

### Explanation

1. **Total Digit Count**:
   - Sum of the digits of all numbers in the list.

2. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
   - For each number, count the trailing zeros.

3. **Sorting and Reduction**:
   - Sort the trailing zeros in descending order.
   - Calculate the sum of the top `ceil((n-1)/2)` trailing zeros that Anna can exploit.

4. **Final Digit Count**:
   - Subtract the sum of trailing zeros from the total digit count.
   - Compare this result with `m + 1` to decide the winner.

This approach ensures that we accurately model the game's mechanics and determine the winner based on optimal play from both players.
