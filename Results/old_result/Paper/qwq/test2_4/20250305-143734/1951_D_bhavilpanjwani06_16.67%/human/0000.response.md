Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here.

So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel ranging from 1 to 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and set the prices in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES", followed by the number of stalls and their respective prices. If it's not possible, I should output "NO".

First, I need to think about the constraints and what they imply.

Constraints:

- t = number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000)

- n = number of coins Alice has (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18)

- k = number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18)

- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.

- Each stall has a price per jewel (1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^18)

Alice's buying behavior:

- She goes to each stall in order.

- At each stall, she buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins.

- She doesn't need to spend all her coins.

Goal:

- Determine if it's possible for Bob to set up the stalls and set prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

- If yes, output "YES", followed by the number of stalls (s), followed by the prices of the stalls.

- If no, output "NO".

Let's consider some examples to understand the problem better.

Example 1:

Input:

3

7 3

6 4

255 8

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

NO

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Explanation:

First test case: Alice has 7 coins and needs to buy 3 jewels. Bob sets up 10 stalls with prices 2 through 11. Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall (7 // 2 = 3 jewels, spending 6 coins), and has 1 coin left, which is not enough to buy any jewels from the remaining stalls.

Third test case: Alice has 255 coins and needs to buy 8 jewels. Bob sets up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. Alice buys 1 jewel from each stall, spending 128, then 64, then 32, then 16, then 8, then 4, then 2, then 1 coin, totaling 255 - 128 - 64 - 32 - 16 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1 = 0 coins left, having bought exactly 8 jewels.

Second test case: It's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

From these examples, I can see that the approach involves setting up stalls in such a way that Alice buys a specific number of jewels in a controlled manner.

Let me think about the general approach.

First, if n < k, it's impossible because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy k jewels (each jewel costs at least 1 coin). So, in this case, output "NO".

If n == k, Alice can buy one jewel from each stall, each with a price of 1 coin. So, set up one stall with price n (since she can buy k jewels from a single stall if the price is n/k, but in this case, n == k, so price = 1). Wait, no: if n == k, and each jewel costs 1 coin, then she can buy k jewels from a single stall. So, output "YES", s=1, p=1.

But in the example, when n=7 and k=3, they set up multiple stalls to control how many jewels she buys.

Wait, in the first example, n=7, k=3, and they set up 10 stalls with prices 2 through 11. Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall (7//2 = 3 jewels, spending 6 coins), and has 1 coin left, which is not enough for any other stall.

Alternatively, could Bob set up fewer stalls? For example, just one stall with price 2 coins per jewel. Alice would buy 3 jewels (6 coins), and have 1 coin left. But according to the problem, this would still be acceptable, as she bought exactly 3 jewels. So why set up 10 stalls?

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint on the number of stalls or the prices. But the problem says "at most 60 stalls", so setting up fewer is allowed.

Wait, perhaps in some cases, setting up multiple stalls is necessary to control the number of jewels bought.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=4, k=2.

Option 1: Set up one stall with price 2 coins per jewel. Alice buys 2 jewels (4//2 = 2), which is exactly k.

Option 2: Set up two stalls, first with price 1, second with price 3.

- At first stall, buys 4//1 = 4 jewels, which is more than k=2. So, this is not desirable.

Option 3: Set up two stalls, first with price 3, second with price 1.

- At first stall, buys 4//3 = 1 jewel, spends 3 coins, has 1 coin left.

- At second stall, buys 1//1 = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, has 0 coins left.

- Total jewels bought: 2, which is exactly k.

So, in this case, setting up two stalls allows us to control the number of jewels bought.

Similarly, in the first example, with n=7, k=3, setting up one stall with price 2 would make Alice buy 3 jewels, which is exactly k. So, why set up 10 stalls? Maybe to demonstrate that it's possible to set up multiple stalls, but it's not necessary.

So, perhaps the minimal number of stalls is not required, as long as it's at most 60.

Now, let's think about a general strategy.

One straightforward way is to set up stalls with decreasing prices so that Alice buys a certain number of jewels at each stall.

Wait, in the third example, the prices are 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, which are decreasing powers of 2. This ensures that Alice buys one jewel at each stall, as her remaining coins are always just enough to buy one jewel at the next stall.

This is similar to the binary representation of n.

In general, if k is less than or equal to n, and we can set up stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels, it should be possible.

But we have to ensure that the number of stalls is at most 60.

Given that prices can be up to 10^18, and we can have up to 60 stalls, we need to find a way to distribute the jewels across these stalls.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

If we set up one stall with price n/k, then Alice would buy exactly k jewels if n is divisible by k. But if n is not divisible by k, she would buy n // p jewels, which might not be exactly k.

Wait, if we set p = n // k, then Alice would buy k jewels if n >= p*k, but she might have some coins left over, which could allow her to buy more jewels if there are more stalls.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice buys as many jewels as possible at each stall, in sequence.

We need the total number of jewels bought to be exactly k.

One way to approach this is to maximize the number of jewels bought at the first stall, then maximize at the second, and so on, until k jewels are bought.

But we need to control exactly k jewels are bought.

An alternative approach is to use a greedy algorithm to set the prices such that at each stall, Alice buys a certain number of jewels, summing up to k.

But this seems vague.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

If k = 1, then Bob can set up one stall with price n, and Alice buys one jewel.

If k = n, then Bob can set up one stall with price 1, and Alice buys n jewels.

But if k is between 1 and n, we need to find a way to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

One idea is to set up stalls with increasing prices, so that Alice buys fewer jewels at each subsequent stall.

Wait, but in the first example, they used decreasing prices.

Wait, perhaps it's better to set up stalls with higher prices first, so that Alice spends more coins early on, leaving fewer coins for later stalls.

But in the third example, they used decreasing prices to make Alice buy one jewel at each stall.

So, it seems that both increasing and decreasing prices can be used depending on the situation.

Let me think about a general method.

Suppose we set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Let's denote the number of jewels bought at each stall as j1, j2, ..., js, where ji = floor(ni / pi), and ni is the remaining coins before visiting stall i.

We need j1 + j2 + ... + js = k.

This seems too general to solve directly.

Perhaps I need to find a way to partition k jewels into s parts, where each part corresponds to the number of jewels bought at each stall.

But it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

If s = 1, then we need to find p such that floor(n / p) = k.

This is possible only if floor(n / k) >= p >= ceil(n / (k + 1)).

Wait, this is the standard approach to find p such that floor(n / p) = k.

Specifically, floor(n / p) = k implies that p <= floor(n / k) and p > floor(n / (k + 1)).

Wait, more precisely:

floor(n / p) = k

This implies:

k <= n / p < k + 1

Which implies:

n / (k + 1) < p <= n / k

So, p should be in (n / (k + 1), n / k].

But p must be an integer, so p should be ceil(n / (k + 1)) + 1 to floor(n / k).

Wait, actually, p should be greater than floor(n / (k + 1)) and less than or equal to floor(n / k).

But p must be an integer, so p can be from floor(n / (k + 1)) + 1 to floor(n / k).

Wait, but floor(n / (k + 1)) + 1 may not be greater than n / (k + 1). Need to be careful.

Let me verify with an example.

Take n=7, k=3.

floor(7 / 3) = 2

floor(7 / 4) = 1

So, p should be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2, i.e., p=2.

Indeed, with p=2, floor(7 / 2)=3, which is k=3.

Similarly, for n=6, k=4.

floor(6 / 4)=1

floor(6 / 5)=1

So, p should be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1, which is impossible. Hence, "NO".

For n=255, k=8.

We can set p=128, then floor(255 / 128)=1

Then remaining coins =255-128=127

Next p=64, floor(127 / 64)=1, remaining=63

Next p=32, floor(63 / 32)=1, remaining=31

Next p=16, floor(31 / 16)=1, remaining=15

Next p=8, floor(15 / 8)=1, remaining=7

Next p=4, floor(7 / 4)=1, remaining=3

Next p=2, floor(3 / 2)=1, remaining=1

Next p=1, floor(1 / 1)=1, remaining=0

Total jewels=8.

So, in this case, setting up 8 stalls with prices that are powers of 2 works.

But in the first case, with n=7, k=3, setting p=2 works with one stall.

But in the example, they set up 10 stalls with p=2,3,4,...,11, and Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall and stops.

So, it's possible to set up multiple stalls, but in this case, it's sufficient to set up only one stall.

So, perhaps the minimal number of stalls is 1, but we can set up more if needed.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so we don't need to minimize the number of stalls.

Now, considering the above, perhaps the general approach is:

- If n < k, output "NO"

- Else if n == k, set up one stall with p=1

- Else, set up multiple stalls with decreasing prices to control the number of jewels bought.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. If n < k, output "NO"

2. Else if n == k, output "YES", s=1, p=1

3. Else, set up two stalls:

- First stall with p = n - k + 1

- Second stall with p = 1

Explanation:

- At the first stall, Alice buys floor(n / p) jewels.

- Set p = n - k + 1

- Then floor(n / (n - k + 1)) = floor(n / (n - k + 1))

Let me check with n=7, k=3:

p = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5

floor(7 / 5) = 1 jewel, remaining coins = 2

Then at the second stall with p=1, buys floor(2 / 1)=2 jewels, total=3 jewels.

Wait, but in the example, they set p=2 at the first stall to buy 3 jewels.

So, in this case, setting p=5 would make Alice buy only 1 jewel at the first stall, and then 2 jewels at the second stall, totaling 3 jewels.

Similarly, for n=255, k=8:

Set p=255-8+1=248 at the first stall.

floor(255 / 248)=1 jewel, remaining=255-248=7

At the second stall with p=1, buys floor(7 / 1)=7 jewels, total=8 jewels.

This seems to work.

But for n=6, k=4:

p=6-4+1=3

floor(6 / 3)=2 jewels, remaining=0

Then at the second stall with p=1, no coins left to buy jewels.

Total jewels=2 < 4, which is not enough.

So, this approach fails in this case.

Hence, this approach is not general.

Alternative approach:

Perhaps set up more than two stalls.

But setting up more stalls increases complexity.

Looking back at the problem, it mentions that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

So, in the first approach, setting p=n - k + 1 works in some cases, but not all.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the condition for floor(n / p) = j, where j is the number of jewels bought at a stall.

We need to control j at each stall.

In the third example, they set up 8 stalls with p=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, and Alice buys one jewel at each stall.

This is similar to the binary representation of n.

In general, for any n and k, perhaps we can set up stalls with prices that correspond to the binary representation of n, but adjusted to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

We need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(ni / pi) = k, where ni is the remaining coins before visiting stall i.

This is complex because ni depends on previous stalls.

Perhaps I need to find a way to make the sum equal to k by choosing appropriate pi.

An alternative idea is to set up stalls in decreasing order of price, starting with higher prices to make Alice buy fewer jewels at each stall, thus requiring more stalls to reach the total of k jewels.

But again, this is not straightforward.

Let me consider mathematical properties.

We need to find s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

Given that s <= 60, and p_i can be up to 10^18.

Given that t can be up to 1000, efficiency is important, but since s is small (<=60), even O(t*s) should be acceptable.

But I need a way to determine the prices p_i for each test case.

Looking back at the initial approach, setting p = n - k + 1 for two stalls works in some cases, but fails in others, as seen in n=6, k=4.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the approach.

Let me consider that with two stalls, it's possible to make Alice buy exactly k jewels, but only if k - 1 < n - k + 1.

Wait, in the provided program, it has:

if n < k:

print('NO')

elif n == k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(n)

elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(n - k + 1, 1)

else:

print('NO')

So, it's using two stalls in some cases.

In the first test case, n=7, k=3:

k - 1 = 2

n - k + 1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5

Since 2 < 5, it outputs "YES", sets s=2, p1=5, p2=1.

As I calculated earlier, this makes Alice buy 1 jewel at the first stall and 2 at the second, totaling 3 jewels.

But in the example, they set up 10 stalls with p=2 through 11, making Alice buy 3 jewels at the first stall and stop.

Both are valid, but the program chooses to set up two stalls.

In the third test case, n=255, k=8:

k - 1 = 7

n - k + 1 = 255 - 8 + 1 = 255 - 7 = 248 +1=248?

Wait, 255 - 8 +1=255 -7=248.

So, k-1=7, n -k +1=248.

Since 7 < 248, it would output "YES", s=2, p1=248, p2=1.

But in the example, it sets up 8 stalls with p=128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

Both are valid, but the program chooses the two-stall setup.

In the second test case, n=6, k=4:

k-1=3

n -k +1=6-4+1=3

Since 3 not < 3, it outputs "NO", which matches the example.

So, the condition k -1 < n - k +1 seems to determine when it's possible to set up two stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But why this condition?

Let's analyze it.

Given two stalls:

First stall: p1 = n - k +1

Second stall: p2 =1

At the first stall, Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels.

With p1 = n - k +1, floor(n / (n - k +1)) = j1

Then remaining coins = n - j1 * p1

At the second stall, with p2=1, she buys floor(remaining / 1) jewels.

We need j1 + j2 = k

Let me compute j1:

j1 = floor(n / (n - k +1))

Let me see for n=7, k=3:

j1 = floor(7 / (7 -3 +1)) = floor(7 / 5) = 1

Remaining coins = 7 - 1*5 = 2

j2 = floor(2 / 1) = 2

Total jewels = 1 + 2 = 3, which is k.

For n=255, k=8:

j1 = floor(255 / (255 -8 +1)) = floor(255 / 248) = 1

Remaining coins = 255 -1*248=7

j2 = floor(7 /1)=7

Total jewels=1+7=8, which is k.

For n=6, k=4:

j1 = floor(6 / (6 -4 +1)) = floor(6 / 3) = 2

Remaining coins = 6 -2*3=0

j2 = floor(0 /1)=0

Total jewels=2+0=2 <4, which is not enough.

So, in this case, it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with two stalls.

Hence, the condition k -1 < n - k +1 seems to ensure that j1 + j2 >=k.

Wait, in the n=6, k=4 case, j1 + j2 =2 <4, so it's impossible.

In n=7, k=3, j1 + j2 =3 >=3.

In n=255, k=8, j1 + j2 =8 >=8.

But in the program, it checks k -1 < n - k +1, which seems to ensure that j1 + j2 >=k.

Wait, but in n=7, k=3, k-1=2, n -k +1=5, 2 <5, which is true, and j1 + j2=3>=3.

In n=6, k=4, k-1=3, n -k +1=3, 3 not <3, so "NO", which matches j1 + j2=2 <4.

So, this condition seems to work.

But is it always sufficient?

Let me check another example.

Suppose n=10, k=5.

k-1=4, n -k +1=10 -5 +1=6, 4 <6, so "YES".

j1 = floor(10 /6)=1

Remaining =10 -1*6=4

j2 = floor(4 /1)=4

Total jewels=1+4=5, which is k.

Good.

Another example: n=10, k=4.

k-1=3, n -k +1=10-4+1=7, 3 <7, so "YES".

j1 = floor(10 /7)=1

Remaining=10 -1*7=3

j2 = floor(3 /1)=3

Total jewels=1+3=4, which is k.

Good.

Another example: n=10, k=6.

k-1=5, n -k +1=10-6+1=5, 5 not <5, so "NO".

But let's check:

j1 = floor(10 /5)=2

Remaining=10 -2*5=0

j2=0

Total jewels=2+0=2 <6, which is indeed not enough.

Hence, the condition k -1 < n - k +1 seems to be sufficient to determine if it's possible to make Alice buy exactly k jewels with two stalls.

But is there a case where k -1 < n - k +1 is true, but j1 + j2 <k?

Let me try to find such a case.

Suppose n=10, k=5, as above, works.

n=15, k=5:

k-1=4, n -k +1=15-5+1=11, 4 <11, "YES".

j1 = floor(15 /11)=1

Remaining=15 -1*11=4

j2 = floor(4 /1)=4

Total jewels=1+4=5=k.

Good.

n=15, k=6:

k-1=5, n -k +1=15-6+1=10, 5 <10, "YES".

j1 = floor(15 /10)=1

Remaining=15 -1*10=5

j2 = floor(5 /1)=5

Total jewels=1+5=6=k.

Good.

n=15, k=7:

k-1=6, n -k +1=15-7+1=9, 6 <9, "YES".

j1 = floor(15 /9)=1

Remaining=15 -1*9=6

j2 = floor(6 /1)=6

Total jewels=1+6=7=k.

Good.

n=15, k=8:

k-1=7, n -k +1=15-8+1=8, 7 <8, "YES".

j1 = floor(15 /8)=1

Remaining=15 -1*8=7

j2 = floor(7 /1)=7

Total jewels=1+7=8=k.

Good.

n=15, k=9:

k-1=8, n -k +1=15-9+1=7, 8 not <7, "NO".

Indeed, j1 + j2=1 + (15 - p1) /1.

If p1=15-9 +1=7, then j1 = floor(15 /7)=2, remaining=15 -2*7=1, j2=1, total=3 <9.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

So, it seems that the condition k -1 < n - k +1 is sufficient to determine if it's possible to make Alice buy exactly k jewels with two stalls.

But is there a case where k -1 < n - k +1 is true, but j1 + j2 <k?

So far, I haven't found such a case.

Let me try to generalize.

Given p1 = n - k +1, p2=1.

j1 = floor(n / p1)

remaining = n - j1 * p1

j2 = floor(remaining / p2) = remaining

Total jewels = j1 + j2

We need j1 + j2 =k.

Given p1 = n - k +1

Then j1 = floor(n / (n - k +1))

Let me denote m = n - k +1

Then j1 = floor(n / m)

remaining = n - j1 * m

j2 = remaining

Total jewels = j1 + remaining = j1 + n - j1 * m

We need j1 + n - j1 * m =k

But n -k = j1 * m - j1 = j1 * (m -1)

Given m = n - k +1, so n -k = m -1

Thus, n -k = m -1 = (n -k +1) -1 = n -k

So, it holds that n -k = j1 * (m -1)

Wait, m = n -k +1

So, n -k = m -1

Thus, n -k = m -1

So, j1 + j2 = j1 + n - j1 * m = j1 + n - j1 * (n -k +1)

But I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Given that m = n -k +1

Then, n = m + k -1

Then, j1 = floor(n / m) = floor((m + k -1) / m)

Since m + k -1 >= m, and (m + k -1) / m = 1 + (k -1)/m

So, floor((m + k -1)/m) = 1 + floor((k -1)/m)

But m = n -k +1

So, floor((k -1)/m) is floor((k -1)/(n -k +1))

So, j1 = 1 + floor((k -1)/(n -k +1))

Then, remaining = n - j1 * m = (m + k -1) - j1 * m

= m + k -1 - j1 * m = k -1 - (j1 -1) * m

Wait, this is getting messy.

Let me consider that if k -1 < m, then floor((k -1)/m)=0

Hence, j1 =1 +0=1

Then, remaining = n -1 * m = n - m = (m + k -1) - m = k -1

Then, j2 = floor((k -1)/1)=k -1

Total jewels = j1 + j2 =1 + (k -1) =k

Perfect, this matches our earlier examples.

Hence, as long as k -1 < m = n -k +1, which is equivalent to k -1 < n -k +1, which simplifies to k -1 < n -k +1 => k -1 < n -k +1 => 2k -2 < n +1 => 2k < n +3 => k < (n +3)/2

Wait, this seems convoluted.

Wait, k -1 < n -k +1 => k -1 < n -k +1 => 2k < n +2 => k < (n +2)/2

So, k < ceil(n /2)

Hence, as long as k < ceil(n /2), it's possible to make Alice buy exactly k jewels with two stalls.

But in the example where n=6, k=4, k=4, ceil(6/2)=3, 4 >3, so "NO", which matches.

In n=7, k=3, ceil(7/2)=4, 3 <4, "YES"

In n=255, k=8, ceil(255/2)=128, 8 <128, "YES"

So, the condition k -1 < n -k +1 is equivalent to k < ceil(n /2)

Hence, the program's approach is correct in these cases.

But is there a way to make Alice buy exactly k jewels when k >= ceil(n /2)?

In such cases, the program says "NO", but is there a way to set up more stalls to make it possible?

Let's consider n=6, k=4.

As per the program, "NO", but maybe with more than two stalls, it's possible.

Let's try setting up three stalls.

Stall 1: p1=3

j1 = floor(6 /3)=2, remaining=6 -2*3=0

Stall 2: p2=1

j2 = floor(0 /1)=0

Stall 3: p3=1

j3 = floor(0 /1)=0

Total jewels=2+0+0=2 <4, not enough.

Another setup: Stall 1: p1=2

j1 = floor(6 /2)=3, remaining=6 -3*2=0

Stall 2: p2=1

j2 =0

Stall 3: p3=1

j3=0

Total jewels=3+0+0=3 <4, still not enough.

Another setup: Stall 1: p1=1.5 (but prices must be integers, so not possible)

Stall 1: p1=1

j1=6 /1=6, which is more than k=4.

Not desirable.

So, with three stalls, it's still not possible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with n=6 coins.

Hence, in this case, "NO" is correct.

Another example: n=5, k=3

k < ceil(5/2)=3, which is not true, since ceil(5/2)=3, and k=3 is not less than 3.

So, k < ceil(n /2) is not satisfied, so "NO"

Can we make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels with n=5 coins and multiple stalls?

Let's try:

Stall 1: p1=2

j1 = floor(5 /2)=2, remaining=5 -2*2=1

Stall 2: p2=1

j2 = floor(1 /1)=1

Total jewels=2+1=3, which is k=3.

So, in this case, even though k=3 is not less than ceil(5/2)=3, it's still possible with two stalls.

But according to the program's condition, k -1=2 < n -k +1=5 -3 +1=3, which is true, so it would output "YES".

Wait, but earlier I thought that k < ceil(n /2) is the condition, but in this case, k=3 and ceil(5/2)=3, so k is not less than ceil(n /2), but the condition k -1 < n -k +1 is true.

Wait, in this case, k -1=2 < n -k +1=3, so it's true, hence "YES".

So, perhaps the condition k -1 < n -k +1 is more general and correct.

Hence, the program's approach seems correct.

But in n=6, k=4:

k -1=3 < n -k +1=6 -4 +1=3, which is not true (3 <3 is false), so "NO"

In n=5, k=3:

k -1=2 < n -k +1=5 -3 +1=3, which is true, so "YES"

In n=7, k=3:

k -1=2 < n -k +1=7 -3 +1=5, which is true, so "YES"

In n=255, k=8:

k -1=7 < n -k +1=255 -8 +1=248, which is true, so "YES"

Hence, the program's approach seems correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
