Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, and I need to find an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

My task is to find such an array a that satisfies these conditions. And if there are multiple possible a arrays, I can output any one of them.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

5

4

2 4 1

3

1 1

6

4 2 5 1 2

2

500

3

1 5

Output:

3 5 4 9

2 5 11

5 14 16 5 11 24

501 500

2 7 5

So, for the first test case, n=4 and x=[2,4,1], and the corresponding a is [3,5,4,9]. Let's verify this:

- 5 % 3 = 2 → matches x_2=2

- 4 % 5 = 4 → matches x_3=4

- 9 % 4 = 1 → matches x_4=1

Looks good.

Now, thinking about how to approach this problem. I need to find a_1, a_2, ..., a_n given x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, where x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}.

I need to find a_i such that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

One way to think about this is to express a_i in terms of a_{i-1} and x_i.

We know that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, which means a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 0.

Our goal is to find suitable k for each step to ensure that a_i stays within the range [1, 10^9].

But this seems a bit tricky, especially since we have a sequence of such dependencies.

Maybe there's a smarter way to choose a_1 and then determine the rest based on that.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting something different.

Let's look at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

t = t - 1

n = int(input())

line = input('')

T = list(map(int, line.split()))

a = [1000]

for i in range(1, n):

a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])

a = a[::-1]

result = ' '.join(map(str, a))

print(result)

So, the code reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads n and the array T (which is x_2 to x_n).

It initializes a list a with [1000], and then for each i from 1 to n-1, it appends a[i-1] - T[i-1] to a.

Then it reverses a and prints the result.

Wait, this seems off.

First, it starts with a[0] = 1000, then for each subsequent a[i], it sets a[i] = a[i-1] - x_i.

But according to the problem, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}.

Is this the correct way to compute a_i?

Let's see with the first test case:

n=4, x=[2,4,1]

According to the code:

a = [1000]

a.append(1000 - 2) → a=[1000,998]

a.append(998 - 4) → a=[1000,998,994]

Then reverse a → [994,998,1000]

So a = [994,998,1000]

But in the example, a should be [3,5,4,9]. This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the code is wrong.

Let me think differently.

I need to find a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}.

I need to find a sequence where each a_i, when divided by a_{i-1}, gives remainder x_i.

One way to approach this is to start from the end of the array and work backwards.

Let's consider the last element.

For i = n, x_n = a_n % a_{n-1}.

I can choose a_{n-1} to be greater than x_n, since a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n implies that a_n >= x_n and a_n < a_{n-1} + x_n.

Wait, no.

Actually, a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n means that a_n = k * a_{n-1} + x_n for some integer k >= 0.

To make a_n as small as possible, I can choose k=1, so a_n = a_{n-1} + x_n.

But I need to ensure that a_{n-1} > x_n, otherwise the modulo would be different.

Wait, if a_{n-1} > x_n, then a_n = a_{n-1} + x_n would give a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n, which is correct.

So, one possible choice is to set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n, starting with some a_1.

But I need to choose a_1 appropriately.

Wait, but in this approach, a_i depends on a_{i-1}, and a_{i-1} depends on a_{i-2}, and so on, back to a_1.

So, perhaps I can choose a_1 arbitrarily, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

But is this correct?

Let's test it with the first example:

n=4, x=[2,4,1]

Choose a_1=3.

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9.

a_4 = a_3 + x_4 = 9 + 1 = 10.

But in the example, a_4 is 9, not 10.

Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to choose a_{i-1} such that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Given x_i, I can choose a_{i-1} to be greater than x_i, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, this seems similar to what I thought before.

Let me try this with the first example.

Start with a_1=3.

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9.

a_4 = a_3 + x_4 = 9 + 1 = 10.

But in the example, a_4 is 9, not 10.

Wait, maybe the example chose a different a_1.

In the example, a=[3,5,4,9].

Wait, so a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

Wait, but according to my approach, a_3 should be a_2 + x_3=5+4=9, but in the example, a_3=4.

So, my approach doesn't match the example.

Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set a_1 to be some value, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

But as we saw, this doesn't match the example.

Alternatively, maybe I can set a_1 to be greater than x_2, and then set a_2 = a_1 + x_2, and so on.

But again, this seems similar to what I did before.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose a_1 to be greater than x_2, and then set a_2 = a_1 + x_2, and so on.

But in the example, a_1=3 and x_2=2, and 3 > 2, which is fine.

Then a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

Wait, but according to my approach, a_3 should be a_2 + x_3=5+4=9, but in the example, a_3=4.

This suggests that my approach is incorrect.

Maybe I need to choose a_{i-1} to be greater than x_i, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

But in the example, a_3=4, which is less than a_2=5, but according to my approach, a_3 should be a_2 + x_3=9, which is larger.

So, perhaps the approach needs to allow a_i to be less than a_{i-1} in some cases.

Wait, but if a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i % a_{i-1} = a_i, since a_i < a_{i-1}.

So, if a_i < a_{i-1}, then x_i = a_i.

In the example, a_3=4 and a_2=5, so 4 < 5, and 4 % 5 = 4, which matches x_3=4.

Similarly, a_4=9 and a_3=4, 9 % 4 =1, which matches x_4=1.

But a_2=5 and a_1=3, 5 % 3 =2, which matches x_2=2.

So, in this case, a_2 > a_1, a_3 < a_2, a_4 > a_3.

So, the sequence goes up and down.

This suggests that my initial approach of always setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i may not work, because it would always increase a_i, but in the example, a_3 is less than a_2.

Therefore, I need a different strategy.

Perhaps I should start from the end of the array and work backwards.

Let's consider the last element.

For i=n, x_n = a_n % a_{n-1}.

I can choose a_{n-1} to be greater than x_n, and then set a_n = a_{n-1} + x_n.

Then, for i=n-1, x_{n-1} = a_{n-1} % a_{n-2}, and I can set a_{n-1} = a_{n-2} + x_{n-1}, provided that a_{n-2} > x_{n-1}.

Wait, this seems similar to my initial approach but in reverse.

But in the example, a_3=4 and a_4=9, so a_4 = 9 and a_3=4, and 9 % 4 =1, which matches x_4=1.

Here, a_4 = a_3 + x_4 =4+1=5, but in the example, a_4=9, which is greater than 5.

So, again, my approach doesn't match the example.

Alternatively, maybe I can set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

But as we've seen, this doesn't match the example.

Wait, perhaps I can set a_1 to be greater than x_2, and then set a_2 = a_1 + x_2, but in the example, a_1=3 and a_2=5, which is a_2 = a_1 + 2, but in the next step, a_3=4, which is less than a_2.

So maybe after setting a_2 = a_1 + x_2, I can set a_3 = a_2 - (a_2 - x_3), or something like that.

This is getting confusing.

Maybe I need to choose a_1 arbitrarily, and then adjust the subsequent a_i accordingly.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that for each i from 2 to n, a_i can be expressed as k_i * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k_i is an integer >=0.

My goal is to find suitable k_i's such that all a_i are within [1,10^9].

Perhaps I can start with a_n, but that seems messy because a_n depends on a_{n-1}, which depends on a_{n-2}, and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps I can choose a_1 to be a large enough number, say 10^9, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} - x_i for i from 2 to n, but only if a_{i-1} > x_i, otherwise choose a larger a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the provided code, it starts with a[0]=1000, and then for each i from 1 to n-1, a[i]=a[i-1]-x_i, and then reverses the array.

Let's see what happens with the first test case:

n=4, x=[2,4,1]

a = [1000]

a.append(1000 - 2) → a=[1000,998]

a.append(998 - 4) → a=[1000,998,994]

Then reverse a → [994,998,1000]

So a = [994,998,1000]

But according to the example, a should be [3,5,4,9].

Clearly, this doesn't match.

Moreover, in this approach, a_i = a_{i-1} - x_i, which implies that a_i < a_{i-1}, which may not always be the case, as seen in the example where a_3=4 < a_2=5, but a_4=9 > a_3=4.

So, this approach seems flawed.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider starting from a_1 and building up the array.

Set a_1 to some value.

Then, for each i from 2 to n:

- Choose a_i such that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Given that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, a_i can be expressed as a_i = k_i * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k_i is an integer >=0.

I need to choose k_i such that a_i is within [1,10^9].

To minimize a_i, I can choose k_i=0, which gives a_i = x_i.

But in this case, a_i must be greater than or equal to x_i.

Wait, but if a_{i-1} > x_i, then a_i can be less than a_{i-1}, specifically a_i = x_i.

Otherwise, if a_{i-1} <= x_i, then a_i must be at least a_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, no.

Actually, a_i can be x_i, a_{i-1} + x_i, 2*a_{i-1} + x_i, etc.

But to make it simple, perhaps I can set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, provided that a_{i-1} > x_i.

If a_{i-1} <= x_i, then I need to choose a_i = k*a_{i-1} + x_i, with k >= ceil((x_i - a_{i-1}) / a_{i-1}).

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

This implies that a_i >= x_i, and a_i < a_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, no.

Actually, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i implies that a_i = k*a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >=0, and a_i >= x_i.

But to minimize a_i, I can choose k=0, so a_i = x_i, provided that x_i < a_{i-1}.

If x_i >= a_{i-1}, then k must be at least 1, so a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, that seems promising.

So, for each i from 2 to n:

- If x_i < a_{i-1}, set a_i = x_i.

- Else, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

This way, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i in both cases.

Let's test this with the first example:

n=4, x=[2,4,1]

Choose a_1=3.

Then:

a_2 = 2, since 2 < 3.

a_3 = 4, but 4 >= 2, so a_3 = 2 + 4 = 6.

a_4 = 1, since 1 < 6.

So a = [3,2,6,1], but in the example, a = [3,5,4,9].

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose a_1 appropriately.

In the example, a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

Wait, but according to my approach, a_2=2, a_3=6, a_4=1.

This suggests that my approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I need to choose a_1 to be greater than the maximum x_i.

Wait, in the first test case, x=[2,4,1], max x_i=4.

If I set a_1=5, then:

a_2 = 2 < 5, so a_2=2.

a_3 = 4 >=2, so a_3=2+4=6.

a_4=1 <6, so a_4=1.

So a=[5,2,6,1], but in the example, a=[3,5,4,9].

Again, doesn't match.

However, let's verify if a=[5,2,6,1] satisfies the conditions:

- 2 % 5 =2 → matches x_2=2

- 6 % 2 =0 ≠4 → doesn't match x_3=4

Oops, that doesn't work.

So my approach is flawed.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, if a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i = x_i.

But in the example, a_3=4 < a_2=5, and x_3=4, which matches.

Similarly, a_4=9 > a_3=4, and 9 %4=1, which matches x_4=1.

Wait, but in my previous attempt, a_3=6 %2=0, which didn't match x_3=4.

So, perhaps I need to ensure that when a_i >= a_{i-1}, a_i is set appropriately.

Wait, maybe I need to set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i when a_i >= a_{i-1}, but adjust it to be the smallest possible value that satisfies a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to find a different approach.

Perhaps I can set a_1 to be the maximum x_i +1, to ensure that a_1 > x_2.

Then, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

Let's try with the first example:

n=4, x=[2,4,1]

Set a_1=5 (since max x_i=4).

Then a_2=5+2=7.

a_3=7+4=11.

a_4=11+1=12.

But in the example, a=[3,5,4,9], which is different.

Let's check if this satisfies the conditions:

- 7 %5=2 → matches x_2=2

- 11%7=4 → matches x_3=4

- 12%11=1 → matches x_4=1

So, this works.

But in the example, a=[3,5,4,9] also works, but my approach gives a=[5,7,11,12].

Both are valid, so perhaps my approach is correct, and the example just chose a different valid a array.

In that case, my approach seems acceptable, as long as it produces a valid a array.

Wait, but earlier I thought that my approach didn't match the example, but actually, as long as any valid a is produced, it's acceptable.

So, perhaps my approach is correct.

But in the earlier test, it didn't work because I chose a_1=5, which led to a_3=11 %7=4, which matched x_3=4, and a_4=12%11=1, which matched x_4=1.

So, it seems to work.

But in the previous flawed attempt, I set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, which worked in this case.

But earlier, I had a mistake where I set a_2=2, which was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that a_i >= x_i, and a_i >= a_{i-1} when x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case, as in the example a_3=4 < a_2=5, and x_3=4 >= a_2=5 is false, since 4 <5.

Wait, 4 <5, so x_3=4 < a_{i-1}=5, so a_i can be set to x_i=4.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

For each i from 2 to n:

- If x_i < a_{i-1}, set a_i = x_i.

- Else, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Let's test this with the first example:

a_1=5

a_2 = x_2=2 <5, so a_2=2

a_3 = x_3=4 <5, so a_3=4

a_4 = x_4=1 <4, so a_4=1

Then a=[5,2,4,1]

Now, check the conditions:

- 2%5=2 → matches x_2=2

- 4%2=0 ≠4 → doesn't match x_3=4

Oops, again, it fails.

So, my approach is incorrect.

I need to adjust it.

Wait, perhaps when x_i >= a_{i-1}, I need to set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

And when x_i < a_{i-1}, set a_i = x_i.

But as we've seen, this doesn't work.

Alternative idea: Maybe set a_1 to be greater than the maximum x_i, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

In the first test case, set a_1=5, a_2=5+2=7, a_3=7+4=11, a_4=11+1=12.

This works, as shown earlier.

In the example, a_1=3, a_2=5=3+2, a_3=4=5 -1, a_4=9=4+5.

Wait, in the example, a_3=4, which is less than a_2=5.

So, perhaps in cases where x_i < a_{i-1}, I can set a_i = x_i, but in the earlier attempt, that led to a_i % a_{i-1} not matching x_i.

Wait, in the example, a_3=4 and a_2=5, so 4 %5=4, which matches x_3=4.

So, perhaps when x_i < a_{i-1}, setting a_i = x_i works.

But in my previous attempt, a_3=4 %2=0 ≠4.

Wait, in that case, a_{i-1}=2, x_i=4, but 4 >=2, so I should set a_i =2 +4=6, and 6%2=0 ≠4.

So, that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose a_{i-1} such that x_i < a_{i-1}, and then set a_i = x_i.

But in the case where x_i >= a_{i-1}, I need to set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, but in the example, x_3=4 >= a_{2}=5 is false, so set a_3 = x_3=4.

And 4 %5=4, which matches x_3=4.

Similarly, x_4=1 < a_3=4, so set a_4=1, and 1%4=1, which matches x_4=1.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

For each i from 2 to n:

- If x_i < a_{i-1}, set a_i = x_i

- Else, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i

Then, to ensure that a_1 is greater than x_2, I can set a_1 to be max(x_2) +1 or higher.

In the first test case, set a_1=5.

Then:

a_2 = x_2=2 <5, so a_2=2

a_3 = x_3=4 <5, so a_3=4

a_4 = x_4=1 <4, so a_4=1

But earlier, this didn't work because a_3=4 %2=0 ≠4.

Wait, but in this case, a_{i-1}=5 for a_2, a_{i-1}=2 for a_3.

Wait, no, in the example, a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to formalize the approach.

Set a_1 to be greater than x_2.

Then, for each i from 2 to n:

- If x_i < a_{i-1}, set a_i = x_i

- Else, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i

In the first test case, set a_1=5.

a_2 =2 <5, so a_2=2

a_3=4 <5, so a_3=4

a_4=1 <4, so a_4=1

Now, check a_3 % a_2 =4%2=0 ≠4.

So, this doesn't work.

But in the example, with a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

Here, a_2=5 > x_2=2, a_3=4 < a_2=5, and a_4=9 > a_3=4.

So, perhaps I need to set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i when x_i >= a_{i-1}, else set a_i = x_i.

But in this case, when x_i >= a_{i-1}, setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i ensures that a_i % a_{i-1} =x_i.

When x_i < a_{i-1}, setting a_i =x_i ensures that a_i % a_{i-1} =x_i, since x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, but in the earlier attempt, when a_{i-1}=2, x_i=4, a_i=4, but 4%2=0 ≠4.

So, this approach fails in this case.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

I need to find another way.

Perhaps I need to choose a_{i-1} such that a_{i-1} > x_i, which ensures that a_i =x_i satisfies a_i % a_{i-1} =x_i.

But in the earlier case, when a_{i-1}=2 and x_i=4, a_i=4, but 4%2=0 ≠4.

So, in this case, I need to set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i =2+4=6, and 6%2=0 ≠4.

Wait, that still doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose a_{i-1} such that a_{i-1} divides a_i -x_i.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think recursively, starting from the end of the array.

Suppose I set a_n to be x_n, and then set a_{n-1} to be x_{n-1}, and so on.

But in the first test case, setting a_4=1, a_3=4, a_2=2, a_1=3.

But in the example, a_4=9, a_3=4, a_2=5, a_1=3.

So, perhaps setting a_n=x_n, a_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, and so on, doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set a_n to be x_n, a_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, and then adjust a_{n-2} based on a_{n-1} and x_{n-1}.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think of a different strategy.

Suppose I set a_1 to be a large number, say 10^9.

Then, set a_2 = a_1 + x_2.

a_3 = a_2 + x_3.

And so on.

This would ensure that a_i >= a_{i-1}, but in the example, a_3=4 < a_2=5, which contradicts this.

So, this approach is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set a_1 to be the greatest x_i +1, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

In the first test case, max x_i=4, so set a_1=5.

Then a_2=5+2=7.

a_3=7+4=11.

a_4=11+1=12.

Now, check:

- 7%5=2 → matches x_2=2

- 11%7=4 → matches x_3=4

- 12%11=1 → matches x_4=1

This works.

In this case, a_i >= a_{i-1} for all i, and a_i % a_{i-1} =x_i.

So, this seems to be a valid approach.

Set a_1 to be greater than the maximum x_i, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

This ensures that a_i > a_{i-1}, and thus a_i % a_{i-1} =x_i, since a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Therefore, this approach works.

In the example, a=[5,7,11,12], which also satisfies the conditions.

Hence, the provided code must be incorrect, as it uses a different approach.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

t = t - 1

n = int(input())

line = input('')

T = list(map(int, line.split()))

a = [1000]

for i in range(1, n):

a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])

a = a[::-1]

result = ' '.join(map(str, a))

print(result)

This code initializes a with [1000], then for each i from 1 to n-1, appends a[i-1] - T[i-1], and then reverses the list.

This seems to be trying to set a_i = a_{i-1} - x_{i-1}, which doesn't align with the correct approach I just derived.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \), given the array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \). The values of \( a_i \) should be between 1 and \( 10^9 \).

### Approach

1. **Initial Choice of \( a_1 \)**:
   - Choose \( a_1 \) to be larger than the maximum value in \( x \) to ensure that \( a_1 > x_2 \). This choice simplifies the construction of the subsequent elements.

2. **Constructing the Array \( a \)**:
   - For each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \). This ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) because \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \), and since \( a_{i-1} > x_i \), the modulus operation will yield \( x_i \).

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    res = []
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        T = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n - 1]))
        idx += n - 1
        max_x = max(T)
        a = [max_x + 1]  # Choose a1 to be greater than the maximum x_i
        for x in T:
            a.append(a[-1] + x)
        res.append(' '.join(map(str, a)))
    print('\n'.join(res))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Read the input values and initialize the variables.
   - Determine the number of test cases \( t \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, read the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).
   - Choose \( a_1 \) to be one greater than the maximum value in \( x \) to ensure \( a_1 > x_2 \).
   - Construct the array \( a \) by setting \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \) for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

3. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the constructed array \( a \) for each test case.

This approach ensures that each \( a_i \) satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) and keeps the values within the specified bounds.
