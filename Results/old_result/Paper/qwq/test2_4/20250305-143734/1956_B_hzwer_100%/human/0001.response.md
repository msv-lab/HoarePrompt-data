Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with me and Nene. There are 2n cards, each card has an integer from 1 to n, and each integer appears exactly twice. So, the deck is made up of pairs of identical numbers.

In the beginning, the cards are distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating between me and Nene, for a total of 2n turns. On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at the number on it, and checks if there's already a card with that number on the table. If there is, the player gets a point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Important points:

- The game is played publicly, so both players can see all the cards on the table at any time.

- Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Let's break it down.

Understanding the game mechanics:

1. **Card Distribution:**

- There are 2n cards with numbers from 1 to n, each number appearing exactly twice.

- These cards are divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

2. **Game Play:**

- We take turns, starting with me, for a total of 2n turns.

- On each turn, a player selects one card from their hand, checks if its number is already on the table, and if it is, they get a point.

- The selected card is then placed on the table.

3. **Nene's Strategy:**

- She plays optimally to maximize her score.

- If there are multiple optimal moves, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My task is to determine the maximum score I can achieve, assuming Nene plays optimally.

Let's consider a simple example to understand better.

**Example 1:**

- n = 1

- My cards: [1]

- Nene's cards: [1]

- Sequence of plays:

1. I play 1 (no point, since the table is empty).

2. Nene plays 1 (she gets a point because 1 is already on the table).

- Final scores: Me = 0, Nene = 1

In this case, it's clear that I can't get any points.

**Example 2:**

- n = 2

- My cards: [1, 1]

- Nene's cards: [2, 2]

- Possible sequence:

1. I play 1 (no point).

2. Nene plays 2 (no point).

3. I play 1 (get a point because 1 is already on the table).

4. Nene plays 2 (gets a point).

- Final scores: Me = 1, Nene = 1

Another possible sequence:

1. I play 1 (no point).

2. Nene plays 2 (no point).

3. I play 1 (get a point).

4. Nene plays 2 (gets a point).

- Same result.

It seems that in this scenario, I can get at least one point.

Wait, but the problem is to find the maximum score I can get assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in this case, Nene will play in a way that maximizes her score first, and among those options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

In the above example, no matter what Nene does, I can get one point.

Let's consider another example.

**Example 3:**

- n = 3

- My cards: [1, 2, 3]

- Nene's cards: [1, 2, 3]

- Possible sequence:

1. I play 1 (no point).

2. Nene plays 1 (gets a point).

3. I play 2 (no point).

4. Nene plays 2 (gets a point).

5. I play 3 (no point).

6. Nene plays 3 (gets a point).

- Final scores: Me = 0, Nene = 3

In this case, it seems I can't get any points.

Wait, is there a way for me to get a point?

Let's try another sequence:

1. I play 1 (no point).

2. Nene plays 2 (no point).

3. I play 2 (get a point).

4. Nene plays 3 (no point).

5. I play 3 (get a point).

6. Nene plays 1 (get a point).

Wait, in this sequence, I get two points, and Nene gets two points.

But Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in the first turn, I play 1 (no point). Then Nene, to maximize her score, would play a card that she knows will give her a point later.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let's think about the frequencies of the numbers in my hand.

In the first example, with n=2, I have two 1's, Nene has two 2's.

In the second example, with n=3, I have one each of 1,2,3, and Nene has one each of 1,2,3.

It seems that if I have multiple cards with the same number, I can potentially get points from them.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

I need to find a way to maximize my points considering Nene's optimal play.

Let me try to find a general strategy.

First, let's consider the frequency of each number in my hand.

Let’s denote:

- For each number i (1 to n), count how many times it appears in my hand (let's say a_i).

- Then, the total number of times i appears in Nene's hand is 2 - a_i.

Goal: maximize my points, considering Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and among those, minimize mine.

I need to think about the sequence of plays.

Since the game is played in turns, and both players can see the table, it's essential to consider the order in which cards are played.

This seems complex due to the alternating turns and the dependency on the table's state.

Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without simulating the game step by step.

Let’s think about the number of points I can get from each number.

For a number i, if I have multiple cards, I can potentially get points when I play a second card of that number, provided that it's already on the table.

But Nene can influence this by playing her cards strategically.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of pairs.

Each number appears exactly twice in the deck.

If I have both cards of a number, I can potentially get a point when playing the second one, as the first one is already on the table.

Similarly, if Nene has both cards of a number, she can get a point when playing the second one.

But if one card is with me and one with Nene, then whoever plays their card first will not get a point, and the second player will get a point.

Given that, perhaps I can calculate, for each number, who will get the point based on who has the second card.

Wait, but it's more complicated because of the interleaving turns and the public nature of the table.

Let me try to categorize the numbers based on how many cards I have for each number.

- For numbers where I have two cards, I can potentially get a point from the second card, provided that the first card is already on the table before I play the second one.

- For numbers where I have one card, the point from that number depends on whether Nene has already played her card of that number.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look at the problem differently.

Let’s consider that the total number of points that can be scored in the game is equal to the number of times a card is played and its number is already on the table.

Since there are 2n cards, and each card played after the first card of its number will score a point for the player playing it.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

I need to maximize my points against her optimal play.

This seems like a zero-sum game, and perhaps I can model it as such.

But maybe there's a simpler way.

Let’s consider the frequency of each number in my hand.

For each number, if I have two cards, I can potentially get one point from the second card, provided that Nene doesn't play her card in between in a way that interferes.

Wait, but Nene can see the table and play accordingly.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about it in terms of graph theory or combinatorics, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of "extra" cards I have for each number.

For example, if I have two cards of the same number, I can potentially get one point from the second card.

But Nene can try to deny that point by playing her cards in a way that minimizes my opportunities.

Wait, maybe I should consider that for each number, if I have two cards, I can get one point, but only if Nene doesn't play her cards in a way to block it.

But Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the maximum points I can get based on the number of pairs I have.

Wait, but in the first example, with n=4 and a= [1,1,2,3], I have one pair of 1's, and Nene has one pair of 4's.

From the pair I have, I can potentially get one point from the second 1, provided that the first 1 is already on the table when I play the second one.

Similarly, Nene can get a point from her second 4.

But in the example, the output is 1, meaning I can get one point.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, which in this case is one.

Wait, but in the second test case with n=8 and a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], I have two pairs (8 and 5), so potentially two points, and indeed the output is 2.

Similarly, in the third test case with n=8 and a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], I have one pair of 4's, so one point, and the output is 1.

In the fourth test case with n=3 and a=[1,2,3], I have no pairs, output is 0.

In the fifth test case with n=1 and a=[1], I have one pair, but since n=1, it's just one pair, and the output is 0.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], output is 1.

In the fifth test case, n=1, a=[1], output is 0.

Wait, but in n=1, there is only one number, and I have both cards, but since there are only two cards, and I play first, I play one card, then Nene plays the other, and she gets the point.

So, in that case, I can't get any points.

Similarly, in n=3, a=[1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3], and no matter the order, I can't get any points because Nene can always play her card after mine to get the point.

In n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], Nene has [2,3,4,4].

If I play one 1, then Nene can play 4, then I play the other 1 to get one point, then Nene plays 4 to get a point, then I play 2, Nene plays 2 to get a point, then I play 3, Nene plays 3 to get a point.

So, I get one point, Nene gets three points.

Alternative sequence: I play 1, Nene plays 4, I play 2, Nene plays 2 to get a point, I play 1 to get a point, Nene plays 4 to get a point, I play 3, Nene plays 3 to get a point.

Still, I get one point.

Seems like in this scenario, I can get at most one point.

Similarly, in n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], I have two pairs of 8 and 5, so potentially two points.

Nene has the remaining cards, which are [3,6,9,10,11,12,13,14] assuming n=8, but since n=8, numbers are from 1 to 8, so perhaps [3,6] if some numbers are missing from my hand.

But in this case, with a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], Nene has the other cards, and I can get two points from my pairs of 8 and 5.

Hence, the output is 2.

Similarly, in n=8, a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], I have one pair of 4's, so one point.

Hence, the output is 1.

In n=3, a=[1,2,3], no pairs, output is 0.

In n=1, a=[1], no pairs (or only one pair, but I can't get a point from it), output is 0.

Wait, but in n=1, a=[1], Nene has the other 1, so:

- I play 1 (no point).

- Nene plays 1 (gets a point).

Hence, I get zero points.

So, in general, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, minus the pairs where Nene can play her card before I play my second card.

But in the first test case, I have one pair, and I can get one point.

In the fifth test case, I have one pair, but I can't get any points.

So, perhaps it's not just the number of pairs I have.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs I have minus the number of pairs where Nene has both cards.

Wait, no, in the fifth test case, n=1, a=[1], so Nene also has [1], which is one pair.

But in that case, I have one pair, but I can't get any points.

Similarly, in n=3, a=[1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3], which are three pairs, but since I have no pairs, I can't get any points.

Wait, but in n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], Nene has [2,3,4,4], which are two pairs.

I have one pair, and I can get one point.

So, perhaps the formula is the number of pairs I have minus the number of pairs Nene has where she has both cards.

Wait, in n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], Nene has [2,3,4,4], which is one pair.

So, number of my pairs is one, Nene's pairs are one, so maybe I can get one minus zero, which is one.

Wait, but in n=1, a=[1], Nene has [1], which is one pair, so number of my pairs is one, Nene's pairs are one, so one minus one is zero, which matches the output.

In n=3, a=[1,2,3], my pairs are zero, Nene's pairs are one (if she has two of any number), but in this case, Nene has [1,2,3], which are no pairs, because each number appears only once in her hand.

Wait, but in n=3, total cards are [1,1,2,2,3,3], if I have [1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3], so she has no pairs either.

Wait, but in n=3, a=[1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3], so neither of us has pairs.

Hence, no points can be scored.

Wait, but in n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], Nene has [2,3,4,4], so she has one pair of 4's.

I have one pair of 1's.

So, perhaps the formula is the number of pairs I have minus the number of pairs Nene has.

In this case, 1 - 1 = 0, but the output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of pairs I have minus the number of pairs Nene has, but in the fifth test case, 1 - 1 = 0, which matches.

But in the first test case, 1 - 1 = 0, but the output is 1.

Hmm.

Maybe it's not directly subtracting the pairs.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, provided that Nene doesn't have pairs that can block my pairs.

Wait, but in the first test case, I have one pair, Nene has one pair, and I can still get one point.

Wait, maybe it's the number of pairs I have, because Nene can't block all of them.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, I have one pair, Nene has one pair, and I can't get any points.

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs I have, minus the number of pairs Nene has that don't overlap with mine.

Wait, in the first test case, I have one pair (1's), Nene has one pair (4's), which don't overlap, so 1 - 1 = 0, but output is 1.

Wait, not matching.

Wait, maybe it's the number of pairs I have, and Nene's pairs don't affect my pairs.

Wait, but again, in the fifth test case, it doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each pair I have, I can get a point unless Nene has a pair that she can play before I play my second card.

But in the first test case, Nene has a pair of 4's, which doesn't overlap with my pair of 1's, so she can't block my pair.

Hence, I can get one point.

In the fifth test case, Nene has a pair of 1's, and I have a pair of 1's, but since we are both trying to play optimally, Nene can play her 1 before I play my second 1, thus preventing me from getting a point.

Wait, but in the first test case, Nene has a pair of 4's, which doesn't interfere with my pair of 1's.

So, perhaps, if Nene has pairs that don't overlap with my pairs, she can't block my pairs.

Hence, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But in the fifth test case, Nene has a pair that overlaps with mine, so I can't get any points.

Wait, but in the first test case, Nene has a pair that doesn't overlap with mine, so I can get my pair's point.

In the fifth test case, Nene has a pair that overlaps with mine, so I can't get any points.

Wait, but in n=3, a=[1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3], neither of us has overlapping pairs, but since I have no pairs, I can't get any points.

Wait, perhaps it's not about overlapping pairs, but about who has both cards of a number.

Wait, maybe the formula is the number of pairs I have minus the number of pairs Nene has where she has both cards.

In the first test case, I have one pair, Nene has one pair, so 1 - 1 = 0, but output is 1.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs I have minus the number of pairs Nene has where she has both cards and those pairs don't overlap with my pairs.

In the first test case, I have one pair of 1's, Nene has one pair of 4's, which doesn't overlap with my pair, so 1 - 1 = 0, but output is 1.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe it's the number of pairs I have minus the number of pairs Nene has where she has both cards and she can play both before I play my second card.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each number, if I have two cards, I can potentially get one point, unless Nene plays her card of that number before I play my second card.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, she will try to play her cards in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

In particular, for the numbers where I have two cards, she might try to play her card of that number early to prevent me from getting a point.

Wait, but in the first test case, she has no cards of my pair (she has 4's, which I don't have), so she can't block me.

Hence, I can get the point from my second 1.

In the fifth test case, she has the other 1, so if she plays her 1 before I play my second 1, she gets the point, and I don't.

Hence, I can't get any points.

Similarly, in n=3, a=[1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3], so for each number, she has one card, but since I have only one card per number, I can't get any points.

In n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], Nene has the other cards, including some pairs.

But since I have pairs of 8 and 5, and Nene has other numbers, she can't block me from getting points from my pairs.

Hence, I can get two points.

So, perhaps the general formula is the number of pairs I have, minus the number of pairs Nene has that overlap with my pairs.

Wait, but in the first test case, Nene has one pair that doesn't overlap with mine, but I can still get one point.

In the fifth test case, Nene has one pair that overlaps with mine, so I can't get any points.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs I have minus the number of pairs Nene has that overlap with my pairs.

In the first test case, number of my pairs is one, number of Nene's pairs that overlap with mine is zero, so 1 - 0 = 1, which matches the output.

In the fifth test case, number of my pairs is one, number of Nene's pairs that overlap is one (since she has the other 1), so 1 - 1 = 0, which matches.

In n=3, a=[1,2,3], number of my pairs is zero, number of Nene's pairs that overlap is zero, so 0 - 0 = 0, which matches.

In n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], number of my pairs is two (8 and 5), number of Nene's pairs that overlap is zero, so 2 - 0 = 2, which matches.

Hence, the formula seems to hold.

So, to implement this, I need to:

1. Count the number of pairs I have.

2. Count the number of pairs Nene has that overlap with my pairs.

3. Subtract the second from the first to get the maximum points I can get.

But wait, in the first test case, Nene has one pair of 4's, which doesn't overlap with my pairs, so overlapping pairs is zero.

Hence, points = my pairs - 0 = 1, which matches.

In the fifth test case, Nene has one pair of 1's, which overlaps with my pair of 1's, so overlapping pairs is one.

Hence, points = 1 - 1 = 0, which matches.

In n=3, a=[1,2,3], Nene has [1,2,3], no pairs, so overlapping pairs is zero, points = 0 - 0 = 0, which matches.

In n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], Nene has the other cards, no overlapping pairs with my pairs, so points = 2 - 0 = 2, which matches.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the implementation would be:

- Count the frequency of each number in my hand.

- For each number, if I have two cards, it's a pair.

- For Nene's pairs that overlap with mine, it's the number of pairs where Nene has two cards and I also have two cards.

Wait, but in the first test case, Nene has a pair of 4's, which doesn't overlap with my pairs (I have pairs of 1's), so overlapping pairs is zero.

In the fifth test case, Nene has a pair of 1's, which overlaps with my pair of 1's, so overlapping pairs is one.

Wait, but in general, overlapping pairs would be the number of numbers where both Nene and I have two cards.

But in the first test case, Nene has a pair of 4's, and I have a pair of 1's, so no overlapping pairs.

In the fifth test case, Nene has a pair of 1's, and I have a pair of 1's, so overlapping pairs is one.

Hence, the formula holds.

Hence, in implementation, I need to:

- Count the frequency of each number in my hand.

- Determine which numbers I have two cards of (my pairs).

- Determine which numbers Nene has two cards of (Nene's pairs).

- Find the overlap between my pairs and Nene's pairs.

- Calculate points as my pairs minus overlapping pairs.

But wait, how do I determine Nene's pairs?

I don't know exactly which cards Nene has, only which cards I have.

But I know that for each number, the total number of cards is two.

Hence, for each number, if I have x cards, Nene has 2 - x cards.

So, for each number, if I have two cards, Nene has zero.

If I have one card, Nene has one.

If I have zero cards, Nene has two.

Hence, Nene's pairs are the numbers where I have zero cards.

Similarly, my pairs are the numbers where I have two cards.

Overlapping pairs are the numbers where both Nene and I have two cards, but since total is two, that's impossible.

Wait, no.

If I have two cards of a number, Nene has zero.

If I have one card, Nene has one.

If I have zero, Nene has two.

Hence, overlapping pairs would be numbers where both Nene and I have two cards, but that's impossible because total is two.

Hence, overlapping pairs is always zero.

But in the fifth test case, when n=1, a=[1], I have two cards of 1, Nene has zero.

But in the explanation, I can't get any points.

Wait, perhaps overlapping pairs isn't the right term.

Wait, maybe it's not about overlapping pairs, but about Nene having pairs that can block my pairs.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs Nene has where she has both cards, and those pairs correspond to numbers where I have at least one card.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, Nene has the pair of 1's, and I have the pair of 1's, so she has both cards, but total is two, so she can't have both if I have both.

Wait, there are only two cards per number.

Hence, if I have two cards of a number, Nene has zero.

Hence, in the fifth test case, Nene has zero cards of 1, but the output is zero.

Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's not about Nene having pairs, but about her having pairs where she can play before me to block my potential points.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of my pairs minus the number of Nene's pairs where she has both cards and those numbers are present in my hand.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, Nene has both 1's, and I have both 1's, but total is only two, so it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let’s consider that for each number, if I have two cards, I can get one point, provided that Nene doesn't have any cards of that number to play before me.

But in reality, if I have two cards of a number, Nene has zero, so she can't play any cards of that number to block me.

Hence, I should be able to get a point from that pair.

But in the fifth test case, n=1, a=[1], I have two 1's, Nene has zero, but the output is zero.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Let's look back at the fifth test case.

n=1, a=[1], meaning I have two 1's, Nene has zero.

But in this case, I play one 1, then Nene plays the other 1.

Wait, but if I have both 1's, how does Nene have any cards?

Wait, with n=1, total cards are two, both assigned to me, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the deck has 2n cards, distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

But in n=1, I get one card, Nene gets one card.

Wait, but in the example, n=1, a=[1], meaning I have one 1, Nene has one 1.

Wait, perhaps I misread it.

Looking back at the example:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

So, the fifth test case is n=1, a=[1], meaning I have one 1, Nene has one 1.

Hence, in this case, I don't have any pairs, only one card.

Hence, I can't get any points.

Similarly, in n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], I have one pair of 1's, Nene has [2,3,4,4], one pair of 4's.

Hence, output is 1.

So, perhaps the formula is simply the number of pairs I have.

In n=1, a=[1], I have zero pairs, output is zero.

In n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], I have one pair, output is one.

In n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], I have two pairs, output is two.

In n=8, a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], I have one pair, output is one.

In n=3, a=[1,2,3], I have zero pairs, output is zero.

Hence, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But in the first test case, I have one pair, and I can get one point, which matches.

In the fifth test case, I have zero pairs, and I get zero points, which matches.

Hence, perhaps the answer is simply the number of pairs I have.

But wait, in the first test case, I have one pair, and I can get one point, but in the explanation, it's mentioned that Nene can play her cards in a way to maximize her score and minimize mine.

However, in that case, since Nene has no cards of my pair, she can't block me from getting the point from my second card of the pair.

Hence, perhaps, the answer is indeed the number of pairs I have.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, I have zero pairs, so zero points.

Hence, perhaps the implementation is correct.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

cnt = [0] * (n + 1)

for x in a:

cnt[x] += 1

ans = 0

for x in cnt:

ans += max(0, x - 1)

print(ans)

This code counts the frequency of each number in my hand, and for each number, if I have two cards, it adds one to the answer.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, n=1, a=[1], cnt[1] = 1, so max(0,1-1)=0, which matches the output.

In the first test case, n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], cnt=[2,1,1,0], so ans = max(0,2-1) + max(0,1-1) + max(0,1-1) + max(0,0-1) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1, which matches.

In n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], cnt=[0,0,1,0,2,2,0,1,2], so ans = max(0,0-1)+max(0,0-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,0-1)+max(0,2-1)+max(0,2-1)+max(0,0-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,2-1) = 0+0+0+0+1+1+0+0+1 = 3, but in the example, output is 2.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, in the second test case, n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], cnt=[0,0,1,0,1,2,0,1,2], assuming numbers are from 1 to 8.

Hence, ans = max(0,0-1)+max(0,0-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,0-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,2-1)+max(0,0-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,2-1) = 0+0+0+0+0+1+0+0+1 = 2, which matches the output.

Wait, in my previous calculation, I mistakenly assumed cnt=[0,0,1,0,2,2,0,1,2], but actually, for n=8, indices are from 1 to 8.

Given a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=0, cnt[4]=1, cnt[5]=2, cnt[6]=0, cnt[7]=1, cnt[8]=2.

Hence, ans = max(0,1-1) + max(0,1-1) + max(0,0-1) + max(0,1-1) + max(0,2-1) + max(0,0-1) + max(0,1-1) + max(0,2-1) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2, which matches.

Hence, the code seems correct.

In the third test case, n=8, a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], cnt=[0,1,1,1,2,0,1,1,0], assuming numbers from 1 to 8.

Hence, ans = max(0,0-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,2-1)+max(0,0-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,0-1) = 0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0+0 = 1, which matches the output.

In the fourth test case, n=3, a=[1,2,3], cnt=[1,1,1,0], assuming numbers from 1 to 3.

Hence, ans = max(0,1-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,1-1)+max(0,0-1) = 0+0+0+0 = 0, which matches.

In the fifth test case, n=1, a=[1], cnt=[0,1], assuming numbers from 1 to 1.

Hence, ans = max(0,1-1) = 0, which matches.

Hence, the code seems correct.

But earlier, I thought that in the first test case, I can get one point, which matches the output.

Hence, perhaps the answer is indeed the number of pairs I have.

But why in the fifth test case, even though I have no pairs, and Nene has the other 1, she can prevent me from getting any points.

Wait, but in the code, for n=1, a=[1], I have one card, no pair, so points = 0, which matches.

Hence, the code seems correct.

But to confirm, let's think about another test case.

Suppose n=2, a=[1,2], Nene has [1,2].

In this case, neither of us has pairs.

Hence, points = 0.

Which makes sense, as no points can be scored.

Another test case: n=2, a=[1,1], Nene has [2,2].

I have one pair, Nene has one pair.

Hence, points = 1, as in the first test case.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Hence, the answer is the number of pairs I have.

Hence, the code is correct.
