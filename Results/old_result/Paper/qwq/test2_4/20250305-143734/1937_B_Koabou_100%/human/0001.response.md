Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump right or down. It needs to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a path looks like. Since the grasshopper can only move right or down, in a 2xN grid, each path will consist of exactly N right moves and (N-1) down moves, or something like that. Wait, actually, let's think carefully. Starting from (1,1), each move can be either right to the next column in the same row or down to the other row in the same column. So, to go from (1,1) to (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make exactly N-1 right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any step, as long as it reaches (2,N) in the end.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let's consider a small N, say N=2. So, grid has two rows and two columns. The possible paths are:

1. Right from (1,1) to (1,2), then down to (2,2).

2. Down from (1,1) to (2,1), then right to (2,2).

So, only two paths in this case. The strings would be a11 + a12 + a22 for the first path, and a11 + a21 + a22 for the second path. We need to find the lexicographically smallest among these strings and count how many paths produce that string.

For N=2, with a11=a12=a21=a22=0, the strings are "000" and "000", both the same, so the smallest is "000" and there are 2 paths that produce it.

In another case, if a11=1, a12=1, a21=1, a22=0, then the strings are "110" and "110", same again, so "110" is the smallest and there are 2 paths.

But in a case where a11=1, a12=0, a21=1, a22=0, the strings are "100" and "110". "100" is lexicographically smaller than "110", so the smallest string is "100" and there is only one path that produces it.

So, the general approach seems to be generating all possible paths, constructing the strings, finding the smallest one, and counting how many paths produce it.

But for N up to 2*10^5, we can't generate all paths explicitly because there are exponentially many paths. So, we need a smarter way.

Let's think about how to find the lexicographically smallest path.

Lexicographical order means we compare strings letter by letter, starting from the first character. So, the smallest string will have the smallest possible character at the first position, then the smallest possible at the second position given the first, and so on.

In this problem, since the grid is only 2 rows high, at each column, we have two choices: take the top cell or the bottom cell, with the constraint that we can only move right or down.

Wait, but actually, in this grid, the grasshopper starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N), with moves only right or down. So, in terms of path, it's like a lattice path where each step is either right or down.

In such a path, the sequence of cells visited will be a sequence that includes a11, then a series of cells where we alternate between row 1 and row 2 based on the moves, finally ending at a2N.

But perhaps there's a better way to model this.

Let me try to model the path.

Let's number the columns from 1 to N.

At each step, the grasshopper is at some cell (r, c), and can move to either (r, c+1) or (down to the other row in the same column), i.e., (3 - r, c).

Wait, since there are only two rows, moving down from row 1 goes to row 2 in the same column, and moving down from row 2 would not make sense because we can only move down from row 1 to row 2.

Wait, actually, in a 2-row grid, moving down from row 1 to row 2 in the same column, and moving right from there.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of sequence of moves.

Starting at (1,1), each move is either right or down, but down is only possible if we are in row 1.

Wait, no, in row 2, we can still move right.

But, in row 1, we can choose to move right or down.

In row 2, we can only move right.

So, the path can be represented by a sequence of moves where, starting at (1,1), we make a series of right and down moves, with down moves only possible from row 1.

The path ends at (2,N).

So, the number of down moves must be exactly one, because we start at row 1 and need to end at row 2.

Wait, actually, no. If we make an odd number of down moves, we'll end up in row 2, since each down move toggles the row.

Wait, but in this problem, down moves are only possible from row 1 to row 2, so, actually, you can only make down moves from row 1.

So, in terms of path, it's like starting at (1,1), then making a sequence of right and down moves, with down moves only possible from row 1, and ending at (2,N).

So, in terms of the sequence of cells visited, it's a sequence that starts with a11, then alternates between row 1 and row 2 based on the moves.

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Another way is to realize that the path can be defined by the column where we make the down move, if we are to make exactly one down move.

Wait, but in the problem, it's possible to make multiple down moves, as long as we end up at (2,N).

Wait, no, in this grid, since we can only move right or down, and down is only possible from row 1 to row 2 in the same column, so, actually, you can only make one down move.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, if you are in row 1, you can move right to the next column in row 1 or down to row 2 in the same column.

Once in row 2, you can only move right to the next column in row 2.

So, effectively, you can make only one down move, from some column in row 1 to the same column in row 2, and then move right in row 2 until column N.

So, in this case, the path is defined by the column where you make the down move.

For example, in N=2:

- If you make the down move in column 1, you go from (1,1) to (2,1), then right to (2,2). The string is a11 + a21 + a22.

- If you make the down move in column 2, you go right to (1,2), then down to (2,2). The string is a11 + a12 + a22.

- If you make the down move in column c, it's a11 + a12 + ... + a1c + a2c + a2(c+1) + ... + a2N.

Wait, no. If you make the down move in column c, you go right from (1,1) to (1,2) to ... (1,c), then down to (2,c), then right to (2,c+1), ..., to (2,N).

So, the string is a11, a12, ..., a1c, a2c, a2(c+1), ..., a2N.

Wait, but in this case, a2c is included only once.

Wait, in the path where you go right to column c in row 1, then down to row 2 in column c, then right to column N in row 2.

So, the string is a11, a12, ..., a1c, a2c, a2(c+1), ..., a2N.

Similarly, if you make the down move in column c, the string is the sequence of a11 to a1c, then a2c to a2N.

So, in this case, the strings are determined by the column c where you make the down move, and the string is a11 to a1c, then a2c to a2N.

Therefore, all possible strings are of the form a11 a12 ... a1c a2c a2(c+1) ... a2N, for c from 1 to N.

Wait, but in the first path, c=1: a11 a12 ... a1c a2c a2(c+1) ... a2N.

Wait, in the first path, c=1: a11 a12 ... a11 a21 a22 ... a2N.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to be careful.

If c=1, the path is (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> ... -> (2,N). So, the string is a11, a21, a22, ..., a2N.

If c=2, the path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> ... -> (2,N). So, the string is a11, a12, a22, a23, ..., a2N.

If c=3, the path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> ... -> (2,N). So, the string is a11, a12, a13, a23, a24, ..., a2N.

And so on, up to c=N, where the path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> ... -> (1,N) -> (2,N). So, the string is a11, a12, ..., a1N, a2N.

Wait, but in the last case, c=N, the path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> ... -> (1,N) -> (2,N), so the string is a11 a12 ... a1N a2N.

Wait, but a2N is only added once.

Wait, in general, for each c from 1 to N, the string is a11 a12 ... a1c a2c a2(c+1) ... a2N.

But in the case c=1, it's a11 a21 a22 ... a2N.

For c=2, it's a11 a12 a22 a23 ... a2N.

For c=3, it's a11 a12 a13 a23 a24 ... a2N.

...

For c=N, it's a11 a12 ... a1N a2N.

So, in each case, the string has length N + 1, since you visit N+1 cells: from (1,1) to (2,N), passing through one cell in each column, except for the column where you make the down move, where you visit two cells.

Wait, no, actually, in each path, you visit N steps: from (1,1) to (2,N), making N moves: some right and some down.

Wait, but in terms of cells visited, it's N+1 cells: starting at (1,1), then N moves to reach (2,N), visiting N+1 cells in total.

So, the string should have length N+1.

In the first path, c=1: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2). So, string is a11, a21, a22.

In the second path, c=2: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2). String is a11, a12, a22.

In the third path, c=3: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3). String is a11, a12, a13, a23.

Wait, but in this case, N=3, and c=3, the path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4). Wait, N=3, so columns 1 to 3, and rows 1 and 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, in general, for N columns, the path starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N), making moves right or down, with down moves only from row 1 to row 2 in the same column.

So, for c from 1 to N, the path is:

- Right to (1,2), ..., right to (1,c), then down to (2,c), then right to (2,c+1), ..., right to (2,N).

So, the string is a11, a12, ..., a1c, a2c, a2(c+1), ..., a2N.

Hence, all possible strings are of this form for c from 1 to N.

Therefore, to find the lexicographically smallest string, we can consider all c from 1 to N, construct the string s_c = a11 a12 ... a1c a2c a2(c+1) ... a2N, and find the smallest among them.

Then, the number of paths that yield this smallest string is the number of c's that produce this smallest string.

But for N up to 2*10^5, and T up to 10^4, with total N over all test cases up to 2*10^5, we need an efficient way to handle this.

So, we need an efficient way to find the lexicographically smallest string among s_c for c from 1 to N, and count how many c's produce this string.

Let's think about how to compare these strings s_c.

Each s_c has length N+1: c elements from row 1, followed by N - c + 1 elements from row 2 starting from column c.

Wait, no, s_c has c elements from row 1 (a11 to a1c), and N - c + 1 elements from row 2 starting from a2c to a2N.

So, s_c = a11 a12 ... a1c a2c a2(c+1) ... a2N.

To find the smallest s_c, we need to find the c that minimizes this string in lex order.

One way to find the smallest s_c is to iterate through c from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal s_c.

But for large N, this would be too slow, as it would be O(N^2).

We need a smarter approach.

Let's consider that s_c is determined by the point where we switch from row 1 to row 2.

So, the strings differ based on where we make that switch.

To find the lex smallest s_c, we can think of it as finding the point c where the sequence a11...a1c a2c...a2N is smallest.

To optimize this, perhaps we can find the earliest position where the sequences differ and choose the one with the smallest character at that position.

But since the strings share some prefix, we need a way to compare them efficiently.

Another idea is to iterate through the columns and decide at each step which row to choose to minimize the string.

Wait, but in this problem, because of the movement constraints, we can't choose arbitrary sequences; we have to follow the path constraints.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem, where we keep track of the current row and column, and maintain the current string built so far, but that would be too slow for large N.

Let me consider another approach.

Let's fix c and write s_c as a11 a12 ... a1c a2c a2(c+1) ... a2N.

Now, for different c, the strings share some prefix.

Let's try to find the c that gives the smallest s_c.

To do this efficiently, perhaps we can iterate through the columns and decide at each step whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

Wait, but given the movement constraints, it's equivalent to choosing the column c where we switch from row 1 to row 2.

So, the problem reduces to choosing the optimal c that minimizes s_c.

To find the minimal s_c, we can iterate through c from 1 to N, compute s_c, and keep track of the minimal one.

But this is O(N^2) time, which is too slow for N up to 2*10^5.

We need a smarter way to find the minimal s_c.

Let me consider that s_c is a concatenation of prefix from row 1 and suffix from row 2, with a2c being part of both.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as s_c = a11 a12 ... a1c a2c a2(c+1) ... a2N.

To find the minimal s_c, perhaps I can iterate through c and keep track of the point where a1c is smaller than a2c, or vice versa.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me consider that for c from 1 to N, s_c is determined by the choice of c, and I need to find the minimal among these s_c.

Given that, perhaps I can find the smallest c such that s_c is lex smallest.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through c from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal s_c.

But again, this is O(N^2) time, which is too slow.

Is there a way to compute all s_c in O(N) time?

Wait, perhaps not directly, but maybe I can find a way to compare s_c efficiently.

Let me consider that s_c is equal to a11 ... a1c a2c ... a2N.

So, s_c = a1[1..c] + a2[c..N].

I need to find the minimal among all such s_c.

To optimize this, perhaps I can precompute suffixes of a2 and prefixes of a1.

Wait, but still, comparing strings directly would be too slow.

Maybe I can find a way to compare s_c and s_{c+1} efficiently.

Let's see:

s_c = a11 a12 ... a1c a2c a2(c+1) ... a2N

s_{c+1} = a11 a12 ... a1(c+1) a2(c+1) a2(c+2) ... a2N

So, s_c and s_{c+1} share some prefix.

To compare s_c and s_{c+1}, I can find the first position where they differ.

This would be the position where a1c differs from a1(c+1), or a2c differs from a1(c+1), etc.

Wait, it's a bit tricky.

Perhaps I can iterate through c from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal s_c.

But again, this is O(N^2) time.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal s_c corresponds to the minimal possible sequence that can be formed by choosing a prefix from row 1 and suffix from row 2, connected through a2c.

Is there a way to merge these two sequences efficiently?

Wait, perhaps I can consider the strings a1[1..c] + a2[c..N] and find the minimal among them.

This seems similar to finding the minimal string in the skew array of a1 and a2.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through c and keep track of the point where switching from a1 to a2 gives the smallest possible extension.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through c and keep track of the minimal a1[1..c] + a2[c..N].

To optimize this, perhaps I can precompute suffix minimums for a2 and prefix values for a1.

Wait, but strings are involved, not just single characters.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through c and for each c, compute s_c, but do it in a way that s_c is built incrementally.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through c from 1 to N and keep track of the current s_c, updating it efficiently.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix c and look at s_c = a1[1..c] + a2[c..N].

I can iterate through c from 1 to N and for each c, construct s_c.

But constructing each s_c explicitly is O(N) time, leading to O(N^2) total time.

I need a way to find the minimal s_c in O(N) time.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position c where a1c is minimal compared to a2c.

Wait, no, it's more complicated than that.

Let me consider that s_c is a1[1..c] + a2[c..N].

So, to find the minimal s_c, I need to find the c that makes this concatenation lex smallest.

One way to approach this is to iterate through the columns and keep track of the current minimal s_c.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through c from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal s_c seen so far.

But again, this seems too slow.

Let me consider that the strings s_c and s_{c+1} share a common prefix.

So, perhaps I can find the c that minimizes the difference between s_c and s_{c+1}.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me consider that s_c is a1[1..c] + a2[c..N], and s_{c+1} is a1[1..(c+1)] + a2[(c+1)..N].

So, s_c and s_{c+1} share the prefix a1[1..c], and differ starting from position c+1.

Wait, no, s_c is a1[1..c] + a2[c..N], and s_{c+1} is a1[1..(c+1)] + a2[(c+1)..N].

So, the first c characters are a1[1..c] for both s_c and s_{c+1}.

Then, s_c has a2[c..N], and s_{c+1} has a1[c+1] followed by a2[(c+1)..N].

So, the difference starts at position c+1.

At position c+1, s_c has a2[c], and s_{c+1} has a1[c+1].

Therefore, to compare s_c and s_{c+1}, we look at a2[c] and a1[c+1].

If a2[c] < a1[c+1], then s_c is smaller than s_{c+1}.

If a2[c] > a1[c+1], then s_{c+1} is smaller.

If a2[c] == a1[c+1], then we need to compare the remaining parts.

Wait, but in that case, the remaining parts are a2[(c+1)..N] for s_c and a2[(c+1)..N] for s_{c+1}.

Wait, no, s_{c+1} has a1[c+1] followed by a2[(c+1)..N], but in s_c, position c+1 is a2[c], and in s_{c+1}, position c+1 is a1[c+1].

Wait, let's clarify:

s_c = a1[1..c] + a2[c..N]

s_{c+1} = a1[1..(c+1)] + a2[(c+1)..N]

So, up to position c, both s_c and s_{c+1} have a1[1..c].

At position c+1:

- s_c has a2[c]

- s_{c+1} has a1[c+1]

Then, from position c+2 onwards:

- s_c has a2[c+1..N]

- s_{c+1} has a2[(c+1)..N]

So, s_c from position c+1 is a2[c] followed by a2[c+1..N]

s_{c+1} from position c+1 is a1[c+1] followed by a2[(c+1)..N]

Therefore, to compare s_c and s_{c+1}, we compare a2[c] and a1[c+1].

If a2[c] < a1[c+1], then s_c is smaller.

If a2[c] > a1[c+1], then s_{c+1} is smaller.

If a2[c] == a1[c+1], then the strings are equal from position c+1 onwards, since a2[c..N] == a1[c+1] + a2[(c+1)..N] only if a2[c] == a1[c+1], a2[c+1] == a1[c+2], and so on.

Wait, not necessarily.

Wait, if a2[c] == a1[c+1], then s_c from position c+1 is a2[c] + a2[c+1..N], and s_{c+1} from position c+1 is a1[c+1] + a2[c+1..N].

Since a2[c] == a1[c+1], the remaining parts are a2[c+1..N] for both.
