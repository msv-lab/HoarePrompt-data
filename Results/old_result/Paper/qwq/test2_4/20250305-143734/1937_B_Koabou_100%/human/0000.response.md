Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump right or down to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's basically the smallest string when comparing them as if they were words in a dictionary. So, for binary strings, '0' comes before '1'. That means that when comparing two strings, the one that has a '0' at the first position where they differ is smaller.

Okay, so I need to find the path that gives the smallest possible string, and then count how many such paths there are.

Let's think about how the grasshopper moves. From any cell, it can either move right or down, provided it doesn't go out of the grid. So, from (1,1), it can go to (1,2) or (2,1). From (1,2), it can go to (1,3) or (2,2), and so on, until it reaches (2,N).

I need to consider all possible paths from (1,1) to (2,N) and find the one that gives the smallest string.

But considering that N can be up to 2*10^5, and the total sum of N across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this without explicitly checking all paths, as that would be too slow.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me try to visualize this. Since it's a 2xN grid, it's a very narrow grid, only two rows. That simplifies things.

Let me think about the path the grasshopper takes. Each path can be represented by a sequence of moves: right (R) and down (D). Since it starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N), it needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, in some order.

Wait, no. Actually, it needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any point in the path, as long as it ends at (2,N).

Wait, actually, no. Let's think carefully.

Starting at (1,1), to reach (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make a total of (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any point in the path.

Wait, actually, more precisely, the down move must be from row 1 to row 2 at some column, and then it continues right to column N.

So, the path can be thought of as moving right some number of times in row 1, then moving down to row 2 at some column, and then moving right to column N in row 2.

So, the only choice is where to make the down move.

Wait, no. Actually, it's more flexible than that. The grasshopper can make multiple down and right moves in any order, as long as it starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N).

Wait, but given that it's only two rows, any path can be simplified to moving right some steps in row 1, then down to row 2 at some column, and then right to column N in row 2.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me think about it. Suppose N=3.

Possible paths:

1. Right to (1,2), right to (1,3), down to (2,3).

String: a11, a12, a13, a23

2. Right to (1,2), down to (2,2), right to (2,3).

String: a11, a12, a22, a23

3. Down to (2,1), right to (2,2), right to (2,3).

String: a11, a21, a22, a23

So, in general, for any N, the path can be represented by choosing at which column to make the down move from row 1 to row 2.

Wait, but in the above example, in path 1, the down move is from (1,3) to (2,3), which is allowed.

So, more generally, the path can be seen as moving right in row 1 up to some column k (where 1 <= k <= N), then moving down to row 2 at column k, and then moving right in row 2 from column k to column N.

So, the string for each path is a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

Our goal is to choose k such that this string is lexicographically smallest possible, and then count how many k's give this same smallest string.

Wait, but actually, it's a bit more nuanced because the down move can be at any point in the path, but in terms of the final string, it seems that the above representation covers all possibilities.

Wait, but in path 2 above, the string is a11, a12, a22, a23, which corresponds to k=2.

In path 1, it's a11, a12, a13, a23, which corresponds to k=3.

In path 3, it's a11, a21, a22, a23, which corresponds to k=1.

So, in general, for any k from 1 to N, there is a path that corresponds to choosing to down at column k.

Therefore, the set of all possible strings corresponds to choosing k from 1 to N, and constructing the string as a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

Our task is to find the lexicographically smallest such string among these N options, and then count how many times this smallest string appears.

So, to find the smallest string, we can consider all k from 1 to N, generate the corresponding string, and find the minimum among them.

Then, count how many times this minimum string appears.

But since N can be up to 2*10^5, and we have up to 10^4 test cases, we need an efficient way to do this.

Generating all N strings and comparing them would be too slow for large N.

So, I need a smarter way to find the minimal string and count its occurrences.

Let me think about how to compare these strings efficiently.

Let's consider that for each k from 1 to N, the string is constructed by taking a11 to a1k, then a2k to a2N.

So, the string for k is: a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

We need to find the minimal such string among all k.

To find the minimal string, we can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal string found so far.

But again, this would be too slow for large N.

I need a way to find the minimal string without generating all of them explicitly.

Let me consider the strings for different k and see if there is a way to find the minimal one efficiently.

Let me consider that the string for k is: a11 to a1k followed by a2k to a2N.

So, the string is: a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

I need to find the minimal among these.

One way to think about this is to iterate through the columns and decide where to switch from row 1 to row 2 in a way that minimizes the string.

Let me think about merging the two rows in a way that produces the smallest possible string.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as merging the two rows with the option to switch from row 1 to row 2 at some point, and I need to choose the switch point that results in the smallest possible merged string.

This sounds similar to merging two sorted arrays, but in this case, the arrays are not sorted, and we're dealing with lexicographical order.

Maybe I can use some kind of pointer approach to find the minimal string.

Let me consider starting from the beginning and at each step choosing the smallest available character from the current positions in row 1 and row 2, considering the path constraints.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps dynamic programming can help here.

Let me consider defining dp[i][j], where i is the current row, j is the current column, and dp[i][j] represents the minimal string from (i,j) to (2,N).

But I'm not sure if that's efficient enough given the constraints.

Wait, maybe I can find the point where switching from row 1 to row 2 makes sense in terms of getting a smaller string.

Let me consider that as long as a1j < a2j, it's better to stay in row 1.

But actually, it's more complicated because the choice affects the subsequent characters in the string.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where a1j > a2j, and consider switching there.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that the string for k is: a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

I need to find the k that makes this string lexicographically smallest.

To compare two strings for different k and k', I need to find the first position where they differ and see which one is smaller there.

This seems tricky to do directly for all k.

Maybe I can find the minimal string by comparing the strings for different k in a smart way.

Let me consider that the string for k is: a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

And for k+1: a11 a12 ... a1(k+1) a2(k+1) a2(k+2) ... a2N.

To compare these two strings, I need to see where they differ.

The initial part is a11 to a1k, and for k+1 it's a11 to a1(k+1).

So, at position k+1, the string for k has a2k, and the string for k+1 has a1(k+1).

Wait, actually, no.

Wait, let's look carefully.

String for k: a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

String for k+1: a11 a12 ... a1k a1(k+1) a2(k+1) a2(k+2) ... a2N.

Wait, not quite.

Wait, string for k+1 is: a11 a12 ... a1(k+1) a2(k+1) a2(k+2) ... a2N.

So, up to a1k, they share a11 to a1k, then string for k has a1(k+1) and string for k+1 has a1(k+1), but then string for k has a2k and string for k+1 has a2(k+1).

Wait, no.

Wait, string for k: a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

String for k+1: a11 a12 ... a1k a1(k+1) a2(k+1) a2(k+2) ... a2N.

So, the first k elements are the same, then string for k has a1(k+1) followed by a2k and the rest of row 2, while string for k+1 has a1(k+1) followed by a2(k+1) and the rest of row 2.

So, at position k+1, both have a1(k+1), then string for k has a2k at position k+2, and string for k+1 has a2(k+1) at position k+2.

So, to compare string_k and string_{k+1}, we look at the first k positions, which are the same, then at position k+1, both have a1(k+1), so they are equal up to position k+1.

Then, at position k+2, string_k has a2k and string_{k+1} has a2(k+1).

So, the comparison depends on a2k vs a2(k+1).

If a2k < a2(k+1), then string_k < string_{k+1}.

If a2k > a2(k+1), then string_{k+1} < string_k.

If a2k == a2(k+1), then we need to look further.

But actually, after position k+2, both strings have the same suffix a2(k+2) ... a2N.

So, the comparison boils down to a2k vs a2(k+1).

Therefore, the ordering between string_k and string_{k+1} depends only on a2k and a2(k+1).

If a2k < a2(k+1), then string_k < string_{k+1}.

If a2k > a2(k+1), then string_{k+1} < string_k.

If a2k == a2(k+1), then the strings are equal up to position k+2, and then they have the same suffix, so the strings are equal.

Wait, no. If a2k == a2(k+1), then at position k+2 they are equal, and the rest of the suffix is the same, so the strings are equal from position k+2 onwards.

But up to position k+1, they are equal, and at position k+2, they are equal, so the strings are equal.

Wait, no. Wait, string_k is a11 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

String_{k+1} is a11 ... a1k a1(k+1) a2(k+1) ... a2N.

Wait, but a1(k+1) might be different from a2k.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's carefully write down string_k and string_{k+1}.

String_k: a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

String_{k+1}: a11 a12 ... a1k a1(k+1) a2(k+1) a2(k+2) ... a2N.

So, up to a1k, they are the same.

Then, string_k has a2k at position k+1, and string_{k+1} has a1(k+1) at position k+1.

Wait, no.

Wait, the positions are:

- string_k: positions 1 to k: a11 to a1k

- position k+1: a2k

- positions k+2 to N+1: a2(k+1) to a2N

Wait, no. Wait, the string for k is a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

So, positions 1 to k: a11 to a1k

Position k+1: a2k

Positions k+2 to N+1: a2(k+1) to a2N

Similarly, string_{k+1}: positions 1 to k: a11 to a1k

Position k+1: a1(k+1)

Position k+2: a2(k+1)

Position k+3 to N+1: a2(k+2) to a2N

So, up to position k, they are the same.

At position k+1, string_k has a2k and string_{k+1} has a1(k+1).

So, to compare string_k and string_{k+1}, we look at position k+1.

If a2k < a1(k+1), then string_k < string_{k+1}.

If a2k > a1(k+1), then string_{k+1} < string_k.

If a2k == a1(k+1), then we need to look at the next position, which is k+2.

At position k+2:

String_k has a2(k+1)

String_{k+1} has a2(k+1)

So, they are equal at position k+2.

And then, the suffix is the same.

Therefore, if a2k == a1(k+1), then string_k == string_{k+1}.

Otherwise, the comparison at position k+1 decides which one is smaller.

So, in summary:

- If a2k < a1(k+1), then string_k < string_{k+1}.

- If a2k > a1(k+1), then string_{k+1} < string_k.

- If a2k == a1(k+1), then string_k == string_{k+1}.

This is a crucial observation.

This means that the sequence of strings for k from 1 to N is non-decreasing, in the sense that each string_k is either equal to or greater than string_{k+1}, depending on the comparison at position k+1.

Wait, no. Actually, depending on the comparison at position k+1.

Wait, let's think about this.

Suppose a2k < a1(k+1), then string_k < string_{k+1}.

So, string_k is better (smaller).

If a2k > a1(k+1), then string_{k+1} < string_k, so string_{k+1} is better.

If a2k == a1(k+1), then string_k == string_{k+1}, so they are equal.

Therefore, as k increases, the strings can either stay the same or get worse (larger).

Wait, no.

Wait, if a2k < a1(k+1), then string_k < string_{k+1}, so string_{k+1} is larger.

If a2k > a1(k+1), then string_{k+1} < string_k, so string_{k+1} is better.

So, as k increases, the strings can either stay the same or get better (smaller).

Wait, no, actually, it's the opposite.

Wait, let's consider an example.

Take N=4, a1 = 1101, a2 = 1100.

Let's compute the strings for k=1 to 4.

For k=1:

string_1 = a11 a21 a22 a23 a24 = 1 1 1 0 0

For k=2:

string_2 = a11 a12 a22 a23 a24 = 1 1 1 0 0

For k=3:

string_3 = a11 a12 a13 a23 a24 = 1 1 0 0 0

For k=4:

string_4 = a11 a12 a13 a14 a24 = 1 1 0 1 0

Now, compare these strings:

string_1: 1 1 1 0 0

string_2: 1 1 1 0 0

string_3: 1 1 0 0 0

string_4: 1 1 0 1 0

So, string_3 is smaller than string_1 and string_2, and string_4 is larger than string_3.

So, in this case, the minimal string is string_3.

So, in this example, as k increases from 1 to 4, the strings start at string_1 and string_2 being equal, then string_3 is smaller, and string_4 is larger than string_3.

So, the minimal string is achieved at k=3.

This matches the observation that when a2k < a1(k+1), string_k < string_{k+1}, meaning that string_{k+1} is larger.

When a2k > a1(k+1), string_{k+1} < string_k, meaning that string_{k+1} is smaller.

When a2k == a1(k+1), string_k == string_{k+1}.

So, to find the minimal string, I need to find the smallest string among all string_k, which corresponds to finding the minimal point where the string cannot be improved further by increasing k.

In other words, I need to find the k where:

- For all m > k, string_m >= string_k

- For all m < k, string_m >= string_k

So, it's a local minimum in the sequence of strings.

Given that, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal string found so far, and also count how many times this minimal string appears.

But again, this would be O(N) per test case, which might be too slow for N up to 2*10^5 and T up to 10^4, since total N across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, so it should be acceptable.

However, I need to optimize it further.

Wait, but 10^4 test cases with up to 2*10^5 N in total means that on average, N per test case is up to 2*10^5 / 10^4 = 20.

So, perhaps iterating through k from 1 to N for each test case is acceptable, since N per test case is small on average.

But to be safe, I need to find a way to compute the minimal string and its count efficiently.

Let me think about how to compute the minimal string without generating all strings explicitly.

From the earlier observation, the strings for consecutive k can be compared based on a2k and a1(k+1).

So, perhaps I can find the range of k where the string is minimal.

Let me try to find the k that gives the minimal string.

I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string found so far.

But I need a way to compare strings efficiently.

Given that strings can be up to length N+1, which is up to 2*10^5 +1, comparing strings directly would be too slow.

I need a way to compare them based on their prefixes.

Wait, perhaps I can find the k that minimizes the string by finding the point where switching from row 1 to row 2 gives the smallest possible continuation.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the one that has the smallest possible characters at the earliest positions.

So, I should try to stay in row 1 as long as possible, but switch to row 2 when it gives a smaller character.

But, considering that after switching to row 2, I have to continue in row 2, I need to choose the switch point carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by choosing the smallest possible character at each position, considering the constraints of the path.

This sounds similar to choosing the path that minimizes the string lexicographically.

Let me think about it differently.

Let me consider that the grasshopper starts at (1,1), and at each step, it can choose to move right or down, and I need to choose the path that results in the smallest possible string.

This sounds like a shortest path problem, but with lexicographical order instead of sum of weights.

I need to find the path that gives the smallest string.

In such cases, a greedy approach often works: always choose the smallest possible character at each step.

In this grid, since it's only two rows, I can consider the choices at each step.

Let me try to simulate the process.

Start at (1,1).

Option 1: move right to (1,2).

Option 2: move down to (2,1).

Choose the one that gives the smallest next character.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire path, not just the next step.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each column whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize current row as row 1.

Initialize the current position as column 1.

Initialize the result string as empty.

While the current position is less than or equal to N:

Add a1[current_row][current_column] to the result string.

If current_row is 1:

Option 1: move right to (1, current_column + 1).

Option 2: move down to (2, current_column).

Choose the option that gives the smallest possible next character.

Similarly, if current_row is 2:

Option 1: move right to (2, current_column + 1).

Option 2: move up to (1, current_column), but wait, moving up is not allowed.

Wait, the grasshopper can only move right or down, so once it moves down to row 2, it can only move right in row 2.

Therefore, in row 2, it can only move right.

In row 1, it can move right or down.

So, in row 1, at each column, it can choose to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

Once in row 2, it must move right until column N.

So, to minimize the string, it should stay in row 1 as long as row 1 has smaller or equal characters compared to row 2.

Wait, but it's not just about the current column, but also about the next columns.

Wait, perhaps I can find the last column k where a1k <= a2k, and then switch to row 2 at column k.

Wait, but I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that at each column, I have a choice: stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

I need to make the choice that leads to the smallest possible string.

To do this, I can iterate through the columns from left to right, and at each column, decide whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row if it gives a smaller character.

But given that in row 2, I can only move right, the decision to switch to row 2 at some column is irreversible in the sense that I have to stay in row 2 until the end.

So, I need to choose the column k where I switch to row 2, such that the resulting string is minimized.

Given that, perhaps I can find the minimal string by finding the smallest possible character at each position, considering the switch point.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can merge the two rows in a way that minimizes the string.

Let me consider that the final string is a sequence of characters where the first part comes from row 1 up to some column k, and the rest from row 2 starting from column k.

So, to minimize the string, I need to choose k such that the concatenation of a11 to a1k and a2k to a2N is lexicographically smallest.

Given that, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and for each k, compare the string formed by a11 to a1k and a2k to a2N, and find the minimal one.

But again, this is O(N^2) in time, which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the string for k is: a11 to a1k followed by a2k to a2N.

So, the string is: a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

I need to find the k that minimizes this string.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string found so far, but I need a way to compare the strings efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimums for row 2.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I can find the k where a1k is minimized, but considering the subsequent characters in row 2.

Wait, this is tricky.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the string for k is: a11 to a1k followed by a2k to a2N.

I can represent this string as: a1[0 to k-1] + a2[k-1 to N-1]

Since it's a binary string, I can think of it as a sequence of bits.

To find the minimal string, I need to find the k where this sequence is smallest lexicographically.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string found so far.

But again, comparing strings directly would be too slow.

I need a way to compare them based on their differences.

Wait, perhaps I can find the k where a1k is as small as possible, and a2k is as small as possible, considering the previous choices.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimal string up to each column.

Define dp[k][r], where k is the column, r is the row, and dp[k][r] is the minimal string to reach (r,k).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain a current minimal string and update it as I iterate through the columns.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize the minimal string as the string for k=1: a11 a21 a22 ... a2N.

Initialize the count as 1.

Then, for k from 2 to N:

Compute the string for k: a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

Compare this string with the current minimal string.

If it's smaller, update the minimal string and reset the count to 1.

If it's equal, increment the count.

If it's larger, do nothing.

This way, after iterating through all k, I have the minimal string and its count.

But this is O(N^2) in time, which is too slow for N up to 2*10^5.

I need a way to compare the strings in O(1) time or O(log N) time.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compare the strings based on their differences starting from the first differing position.

Wait, let's consider that for k and k+1, the strings differ starting from position k+1.

Because up to position k, they are the same, and at position k+1, string_k has a2k and string_{k+1} has a1(k+1).

Then, at position k+2, both have a2(k+1), and so on.

So, to compare string_k and string_{k+1}, I need to compare a2k and a1(k+1).

If a2k < a1(k+1), then string_k < string_{k+1}.

If a2k > a1(k+1), then string_{k+1} < string_k.

If a2k == a1(k+1), then the strings are equal up to position k+1, and then they have the same suffix a2(k+1) to a2N, so they are equal.

Therefore, the sequence of strings for k from 1 to N can be seen as a sequence where each string is either equal to or different from the next one based on a2k and a1(k+1).

Given that, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string by comparing a2k and a1(k+1).

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k and find the k where a2k is minimized, considering the transition from row 1 to row 2.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me try to find the k where switching to row 2 gives the smallest possible string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string up to that column.

Wait, maybe I can maintain two options: staying in row 1 or switching to row 2.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize two options:

- Option 1: stay in row 1.

- Option 2: switch to row 2 at some column.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the current minimal string for each column.

Define two arrays:

- dp1[k]: minimal string up to column k if staying in row 1.

- dp2[k]: minimal string up to column k if switching to row 2 at some column <=k.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of prefixes.

Wait, maybe I can compute the minimal string by considering the point where switching to row 2 is beneficial.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by finding the point where a1k > a2k, and switch at that point.

But I need to consider the entire string, not just individual characters.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by choosing the smallest possible a1k and a2k at each step.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the two rows as two strings, and find the minimal merge of these two strings, considering the path constraints.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the suffixes of row 2 and see how they compare.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimums for row 2.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I can find the k where a1k is minimized, considering that a2k will be appended next.

Wait, this is too vague.

Let me consider that the string for k is: a1[0 to k-1] + a2[k-1 to N-1]

Wait, in 0-based indexing.

So, string_k = a1[0] a1[1] ... a1[k-1] a2[k-1] a2[k] ... a2[N-1]

I need to find the k that minimizes this string.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through k from 0 to N-1, and keep track of the minimal string.

But again, comparing strings directly is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the strings as integers in base 2, but that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I can find the k where a2[k-1] is minimized, but considering the previous a1's.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k and keep track of the minimal a2[k-1], considering that a1[0 to k-1] is fixed.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that the string for k is: a1[0 to k-1] + a2[k-1 to N-1]

So, the string is a1[0] a1[1] ... a1[k-1] a2[k-1] a2[k] ... a2[N-1]

I need to find the k that minimizes this string.

To do this, I can iterate through k from 0 to N, and for each k, compare a1[k] with a2[k].

Wait, not quite.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the positions from left to right and decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

At each step, choose the smallest possible character available.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and choose the smallest available character at each step, considering the path constraints.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize current row as row 1.

Initialize an empty string.

For each column from 1 to N:

If current row is row 1:

Option 1: stay in row 1 and take a1[j].

Option 2: switch to row 2 and take a2[j].

Choose the smallest available character.

If current row is row 2:

Only option: stay in row 2 and take a2[j].

Wait, this seems promising.

So, starting from column 1:

- If a1[1] < a2[1], choose a1[1] and stay in row 1.

- Else, choose a2[1] and switch to row 2.

Then, for column 2:

- If still in row 1: choose a1[2] or switch to row 2 and choose a2[2].

- If in row 2: choose a2[2].

And so on.

Wait, but this seems similar to the earlier idea of iterating through columns and choosing the smallest available character at each step.

But I need to make sure that this leads to the minimal string.

Let me try with the second test case.

N=4

a1 = 1101

a2 = 1100

So, a1 = [1,1,0,1]

a2 = [1,1,0,0]

Start at column 1:

- a1[1] = 1, a2[1] = 1

- Since equal, choose a1[1] = 1 and stay in row 1.

Add '1' to the string.

Column 2:

- a1[2] = 1, a2[2] = 1

- Equal, choose a1[2] = 1 and stay in row 1.

Add '1' to the string.

Column 3:

- a1[3] = 0, a2[3] = 0

- Equal, choose a1[3] = 0 and stay in row 1.

Add '0' to the string.

Column 4:

- a1[4] = 1, a2[4] = 0

- a1[4] = '1', a2[4] = '0'

- Choose a2[4] = '0' and switch to row 2.

Add '0' to the string.

Then, since we switched to row 2 at column 4, we have to continue in row 2.

But in this case, since column 4 is the last column, that's it.

So, the string is '1100', which matches the example.

Wait, but in the example, the minimal string is '11000', which corresponds to N=4, so length 5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting N.

Wait, in the second test case, N=4, and the strings are of length 5, but since N=4, the grid has columns from 1 to 4, and the string has length 5 because it's a11 to a1k and a2k to a2N, which is k elements from row 1 and (N - k + 1) elements from row 2.

Wait, in N=4, k=2: a11 a12 a22 a23 a24, which is 5 elements.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, I only added 4 characters, but according to the problem, the string should have length N+1=5.

Wait, perhaps I need to include a2k in the string when switching at k.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Let me try again.

Start at column 1:

- Current row: 1

- Choose a1[1] = '1'

- Options: stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

- a1[1] = '1', a2[1] = '1'

- Since equal, choose to stay in row 1.

Add '1' to the string.

Column 2:

- Current row: 1

- Choose a1[2] = '1'

- Options: stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

- a1[2] = '1', a2[2] = '1'

- Equal, choose to stay in row 1.

Add '1' to the string.

Column 3:

- Current row: 1

- Choose a1[3] = '0'

- Options: stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

- a1[3] = '0', a2[3] = '0'

- Equal, choose to stay in row 1.

Add '0' to the string.

Column 4:

- Current row: 1

- Choose a1[4] = '1'

- Options: stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

- a1[4] = '1', a2[4] = '0'

- a2[4] < a1[4], so choose to switch to row 2 and take a2[4] = '0'

Add '0' to the string.

Now, since in row 2, I have to move right to column 5, but N=4, so no column 5.

Wait, but in the example, the string is '11000', which is length 5 for N=4.

Wait, perhaps I need to include a2k when switching.

Wait, perhaps I need to include a2k when switching at column k.

Wait, perhaps I need to include a2(k-1) in the string when switching at column k.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look back at how the string is constructed.

For k=2 in N=4:

string = a11 a12 a22 a23 a24 = '1 1 1 0 0'

For k=3:

string = a11 a12 a13 a23 a24 = '1 1 0 0 0'

For k=4:

string = a11 a12 a13 a14 a24 = '1 1 0 1 0'

So, in my simulation, I have '1100', but according to the problem, it's '11000'.

So, perhaps I need to include a2k when switching at k.

Wait, in the string for k=3: a11 a12 a13 a23 a24 = '1 1 0 0 0'

So, in my simulation, I have '1100', but according to the problem, it's '11000'.

Wait, perhaps I need to include a2k when switching at k, and then continue with a2(k+1) to a2N.

In my simulation, I included a2k when switching at k, but didn't include a2(k+1) to a2N.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my simulation to include a2k and then a2(k+1) to a2N.

Wait, in the simulation I did earlier, I only added a2k when switching at k, but according to the problem, when switching at k, I should add a2k and then a2(k+1) to a2N.

So, in the earlier simulation, for k=3 in N=4:

- Add a11='1', a12='1', a13='0'

- Then, switch to row 2 at column 3, add a23='0', a24='0'

- So, the string is '11000', which matches the example.

Similarly, for k=4:

- Add a11='1', a12='1', a13='0', a14='1'

- Then, switch to row 2 at column 4, add a24='0'

- So, the string is '11010'

So, in my earlier simulation, I was missing the inclusion of a2k and the subsequent a2(k+1) to a2N when switching at k.

Therefore, I need to adjust my simulation to include a2k and the rest of row 2 when switching at k.

So, perhaps I can simulate the process by choosing at
