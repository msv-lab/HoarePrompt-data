Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the list a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on day i, then from day i+1 onwards, the price per ticket increases by x.

My goal is to buy exactly k tickets at the minimum total cost.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's look at the example to get a better grasp.

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 3

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

The optimal way is:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices become [6, 4, 2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices become [4, 2]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost = 4, prices become [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 6

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10

In the second test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 8

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

Only one way:

- Buy 2 on day 1: cost = 16, prices become [8, 6, 4]

- Buy 2 on day 2: cost = 16, prices become [8, 6]

- Buy 2 on day 3: cost = 16, prices become [8]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 16

Total cost = 64

From these examples, it seems like buying tickets on later days is cheaper because the prices are lower, but buying on earlier days can affect the prices on later days.

I need to find a strategy that minimizes the total cost.

Let me think about the constraints:

- n can be up to 3*10^5, which is 300,000 days.

- m can be up to 10^9, which is a billion tickets per day.

- k can be up to min(n*m, 10^9), which is up to a billion tickets.

So, the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n log n) at worst, since n can be up to 300,000.

Given that t, the number of test cases, can be up to 10^4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, it's manageable.

First, I need to find a way to model the problem.

Let's consider that the price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for all j < i, where x_j is the number of tickets bought on day j.

Wait, more precisely, the price per ticket on day i after buying x tickets before day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on days before i.

But actually, the problem says: "If a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x."

So, the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for all j < i.

But in the example, when buying 2 on day 1, prices become [8, 6, 4, 2] -> [8, 6+2, 4+2, 2+2] = [8, 8, 6, 4]

Wait, but in the explanation, it seems different.

Wait, in the first test case, buying 0 on day 1 keeps prices as [6,4,2].

Wait, no. If you buy x tickets on day i, from day i+1 onwards, the price per ticket increases by x.

So, if you buy x tickets on day 1, then from day 2 onwards, prices increase by x.

If you buy y tickets on day 2, then from day 3 onwards, prices increase by x + y.

Wait, but in the first test case, buying 0 on day 1 means prices remain as [6,4,2].

Then buying 0 on day 2 means prices remain as [4,2].

Then buying 1 on day 3: cost is 4, and from day 4 onwards, prices increase by 1, so [2+1] = [3].

Then buying 2 on day 4: cost is 2*3 = 6.

Total cost is 4 + 6 = 10.

So, it seems that the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of all x_j for j < i.

Wait, in this case, buying 0 on day 1, prices on day 2 are a_2 + 0 = 6, day 3: a_3 + 0 = 4, day 4: a_4 + 0 = 2.

Then buying 0 on day 2: prices on day 3 and 4 remain the same.

Then buying 1 on day 3: cost is (a_3 + 0) * 1 = 4, and from day 4 onwards, prices increase by 1, so day 4: a_4 + 0 + 1 = 3.

Then buying 2 on day 4: cost is (a_4 + 0 + 1) * 2 = 6.

Total cost: 4 + 6 = 10.

Okay, that matches.

So, the price on day i when buying x tickets is (a_i + sum of x_j for j < i) * x.

Our goal is to choose x_i for each day (number of tickets to buy on day i), with 0 <= x_i <= m, and sum of x_i = k, such that the total cost is minimized.

Total cost = sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j)

This seems complicated because of the dependency of the price on previous purchases.

I need to find a way to minimize this total cost.

Let me try to rearrange the total cost expression.

Let’s denote s_i = sum of x_j for j from 1 to i.

Then s_0 = 0, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i.

Then the price on day i is a_i + s_{i-1}.

So, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}).

Total cost = sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

But s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i.

So, total cost = sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + s_i - x_i) = sum over i from 1 to n of (x_i * a_i + x_i * s_i - x_i^2)

But s_i = sum of x_j for j from 1 to i.

So, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i.

This seems messy.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let’s consider that the increase in price for future days depends on the cumulative tickets bought so far.

Perhaps I can model this as a priority queue or something similar.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the increasing prices.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets I buy on each day, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, with sum x_i = k and 0 <= x_i <= m.

Then, the total cost is sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j)

Let’s denote s_i = sum over j from 1 to i of x_j.

Then s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i.

So, total cost = sum over i of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

But s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i.

Wait, that might not help directly.

Let me try to expand the total cost:

Total cost = sum over i of x_i * a_i + x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1}

But s_{i-1} = sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j.

So, sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of x_i * (sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j) = sum over 1 <= j < i <= n of x_i * x_j

So, total cost = sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over 1 <= j < i <= n of x_i * x_j

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of dynamic programming.

Let’s consider dp[i][s], where s is the number of tickets bought up to day i.

But with k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the greedy approach.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

But wait, the prices increase based on previous purchases, so it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i and assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_i.

But I need to consider the price increases due to previous purchases.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the total cost per ticket.

If I buy x tickets on day i, the cost is x * (a_i + s), where s is the sum of tickets bought before day i.

So, perhaps I should buy tickets on days with the lowest a_i + s.

But s depends on previous purchases, so it's interdependent.

This seems like a minimum cost flow problem, where each day is a node, and I can send flow (number of tickets) subject to the capacity m per day, and the cost increases based on the flow sent in previous days.

But implementing that seems too time-consuming and maybe not efficient enough for the constraints.

Let me look for a mathematical optimization.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, with sum x_i = k and 0 <= x_i <= m.

Then, the total cost is sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j)

Let’s denote s = sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j.

Then, the cost for day i is x_i * (a_i + s)

I need to minimize sum over i of x_i * a_i + x_i * s

But s is the cumulative sum up to i-1.

This seems like a sum of products of variables and their prefixes.

This is similar to some optimization problems I've seen in calculus, but with integer variables and constraints.

Maybe I can model this as a quadratic function and find its minimum.

But with variables being integers and constrained, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider small values and see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

Sort a in ascending order: [2,4,6,8]

But in the optimal strategy, we bought 1 ticket on day 3 and 2 tickets on day 4.

Wait, in sorted order, day 4 has a=2, day 3 has a=4, etc.

So, perhaps buying on days with lower a_i is better, but need to consider the price increases.

Wait, maybe I should buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, but considering the price increases for future days.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that each ticket bought on a day affects the prices of all subsequent days.

So, each ticket bought on day i increases the price for all later days by 1.

Therefore, the total cost for buying x_i tickets on day i is x_i * a_i plus x_i * (sum over j from i+1 to n of x_j)

Because each x_i contributes x_i to the price increase for all later days.

Wait, more precisely, each ticket bought on day i increases the price for all later days by 1 per ticket.

So, the total price increase for days j > i is x_i * (number of tickets bought on days j > i)

But this seems too convoluted.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the total cost as:

sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * (sum over j from i+1 to n of x_j)

Which simplifies to sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * (k - s_i)

Wait, s_i is sum from j=1 to i of x_j.

Wait, need to be careful with indices.

Let me denote s_i = sum from j=1 to i of x_j

Then, sum over j from i+1 to n of x_j = k - s_i

So, the total cost is sum over i of x_i * a_i + x_i * (k - s_i)

But s_i = sum from j=1 to i of x_j

So, total cost = sum over i of x_i * a_i + x_i * (k - s_i)

= sum over i of x_i * a_i + x_i * k - x_i * s_i

But s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i, where s_0 = 0

So, total cost = sum over i of x_i * a_i + x_i * k - x_i * s_{i-1} - x_i^2

Wait, this seems messy.

Maybe there's another way.

Let me consider the incremental cost of buying an additional ticket on day i.

The cost of buying one ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

Which is a_i plus the total tickets bought before day i.

So, if I buy x_i tickets on day i, the cost is x_i * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j)

This seems similar to assigning a cost to each ticket based on the day it's bought and the cumulative tickets bought before that day.

This sounds like a linear assignment problem, but I need a more efficient way to compute it.

Perhaps I can sort the days in some order and assign tickets accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can sort the days based on a_i in ascending order and assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_i, considering the constraints.

But I need to account for the price increases due to previous purchases.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of priority queues.

Let me consider that I should buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price, considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

So, I can maintain a sorted list of days based on their current price, and iteratively buy as many tickets as possible on the day with the lowest current price, up to the daily limit m.

Then, after buying on that day, increase the prices of the remaining days by the number of tickets bought.

Repeat this process until all tickets are bought.

This sounds similar to a greedy approach.

Let me try this with the first test case.

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

Initialize prices: [8,6,4,2]

Find the day with the lowest price: day 4 with 2.

Buy 2 tickets on day 4: cost = 2 * 2 = 4

Increase prices for remaining days by 2: [10,8,6]

Now, prices are [10,8,6]

Find the day with the lowest price: day 3 with 6.

Buy 1 ticket on day 3: cost = 6 * 1 = 6

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10

Which matches the first test case.

Let's try the second test case.

n=4, m=2, k=8

a = [8,6,4,2]

Initialize prices: [8,6,4,2]

Find the day with the lowest price: day 4 with 2.

Buy 2 tickets on day 4: cost = 2 * 2 = 4

Increase prices for remaining days by 2: [10,8,6]

Find the day with the lowest price: day 3 with 6.

Buy 2 tickets on day 3: cost = 6 * 2 = 12

Increase prices for remaining days by 2: [12,10]

Find the day with the lowest price: day 2 with 10.

Buy 2 tickets on day 2: cost = 10 * 2 = 20

Increase prices for remaining days by 2: [14]

Find the day with the lowest price: day 1 with 14.

Buy 2 tickets on day 1: cost = 14 * 2 = 28

Total cost = 4 + 12 + 20 + 28 = 64

Which matches the second test case.

Seems like this approach works.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

With n up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient solution.

Implementing this approach directly with sorting or heap operations might be too slow, as it would be O(k log n), and k can be up to 1e9.

I need a better way.

Let me see if I can find a mathematical formula or a way to calculate the total cost without iterating day by day.

Let’s consider that each ticket bought on a day contributes to the cost based on the price on that day plus the number of tickets bought on all previous days.

So, the cost of the p-th ticket bought in this process is a_{d(p)} + s(p-1), where d(p) is the day on which the p-th ticket is bought, and s(p-1) is the number of tickets bought before the p-th ticket.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of ordering the tickets based on the day they are bought and the cumulative effect.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to find a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days in ascending order of a_i and assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_i, considering the constraints.

But I need to account for the price increases due to previous purchases.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the total cost based on the order of buying tickets on sorted days.

Let’s sort the days in ascending order of a_i.

Then, assign tickets to the days starting from the lowest a_i, but considering the price increases.

Wait, but in the first test case, sorted a is [2,4,6,8], and in the optimal strategy, we bought 1 ticket on day 3 (a=4) and 2 tickets on day 4 (a=2).

Wait, day 4 has a=2, but in sorted order, it's still day 4.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let’s consider that for each ticket, I choose the day to buy it, considering the cumulative effect.

But with k up to 1e9, I need a way to calculate this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can group the tickets bought on the same day and calculate the cost for each group.

Let me think about the prices.

If I buy x tickets on day i, the cost is x * (a_i + s), where s is the sum of tickets bought before day i.

If I sort the days in ascending order of a_i + s, but s depends on previous purchases.

This seems circular.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the increasing prices.

This sounds like a minimum cost assignment problem.

But with large n and k, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Sort the days in ascending order of a_i.

2. Assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_i, considering the constraints.

But I need to account for the price increases due to previous purchases.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the sorted days and assign tickets accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of prefix sums.

Let’s sort the days in ascending order of a_i.

Let’s say the sorted prices are b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n.

Now, if I buy x_1 tickets on the first day, x_2 on the second, and so on, with x_i <= m and sum x_i = k.

But the cost for day i is b_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j.

Wait, but the sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j is the total tickets bought before day i.

So, the cost for day i is b_i + s_{i-1}, where s_{i-1} is the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

So, total cost is sum over i of x_i * (b_i + s_{i-1})

Let’s denote s_0 = 0, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i.

So, total cost = sum over i of x_i * b_i + x_i * s_{i-1}

= sum over i of x_i * b_i + sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1}

= sum over i of x_i * b_i + sum over i of x_i * (s_i - x_i)

= sum over i of x_i * b_i + sum over i of x_i * s_i - sum over i of x_i^2

This still seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I can express s_i in terms of the cumulative sum.

Let me try to find a better way.

Let’s consider that s_i = sum over j=1 to i of x_j

Then, sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of x_i * (s_i - x_i) = sum over i of x_i * s_i - sum over i of x_i^2

But sum over i of x_i * s_i = sum over i of x_i * sum over j=1 to i of x_j = sum over 1 <= j <= i <= n of x_i * x_j

This seems too complicated.

Maybe I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum over p from 1 to k of a_{d(p)} + (p - 1), where d(p) is the day on which the p-th ticket is bought.

Wait, why p - 1? Because each previous ticket increases the price by 1 for all subsequent tickets.

Wait, no. Each ticket bought on any day increases the price for all subsequent days by 1 per ticket.

So, for the p-th ticket bought on day d(p), the price is a_{d(p)} plus the sum of x_j for j from 1 to d(p)-1.

Wait, this is getting too involved.

Let me try to think of it in terms of assigning tickets to days, where each ticket has a cost based on the day it's assigned to and the number of tickets assigned to previous days.

This sounds like assigning k tickets to n days, where the cost of the p-th ticket assigned to day i is a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i.

This seems similar to assigning priorities or ordering the assignments.

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I can consider that the minimal total cost is achieved by assigning the earliest tickets to the days with the lowest adjusted prices, considering the price increases.

But I need a way to calculate this efficiently.

Wait, maybe I can model this problem using the concept of minimum cost to buy k tickets with increasing prices based on previous purchases.

I recall that in algorithmic problems, when there are dependencies between choices that affect future costs, sometimes we can use priority queues or sort the elements in a certain way to minimize the total cost.

In this case, since buying tickets on a day increases the prices for future days, it's beneficial to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest initial prices, considering the constraints.

Wait, but m is the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day.

So, perhaps I can sort the days in ascending order of a_i and buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, up to m per day.

But I need to account for the price increases due to previous purchases.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the sorted days and assign tickets accordingly.

Let me try to formalize this.

Sort the days in ascending order of a_i.

Let’s say the sorted prices are b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n.

Now, I need to assign x_1, x_2, ..., x_n tickets to each day, with x_i <= m and sum x_i = k.

The total cost would be sum over i of x_i * (b_i + sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j)

Which is sum over i of x_i * b_i + x_i * s_{i-1}, where s_{i-1} is the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

This still seems tricky.

Let me try to compute this differently.

Let’s denote s_i = sum over j=1 to i of x_j.

Then s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i.

So, the cost for day i is x_i * (b_i + s_{i-1}) = x_i * b_i + x_i * s_{i-1}

Then, total cost = sum over i of x_i * b_i + sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1}

But s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i.

So, total cost = sum over i of x_i * b_i + sum over i of x_i * (s_i - x_i) = sum over i of x_i * b_i + sum over i of x_i * s_i - sum over i of x_i^2

This seems no better.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that s_i is the cumulative sum up to day i, and find a way to express the total cost in terms of s_i.

Let me try to express the total cost in terms of s_i.

Total cost = sum over i of x_i * b_i + x_i * s_{i-1}

But s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i.

So, total cost = sum over i of x_i * b_i + x_i * (s_i - x_i) = sum over i of x_i * b_i + x_i * s_i - x_i^2

Now, sum over i of x_i * s_i = sum over i of x_i * sum over j=1 to i of x_j = sum over 1 <= j <= i <= n of x_i * x_j

This seems too involved.

Maybe I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that each ticket bought increases the price for all future tickets by 1.

So, the total cost can be expressed as sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + (p - 1), where d(p) is the day on which the p-th ticket is bought.

So, total cost = sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + (p - 1)

= sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + sum over p=1 to k of (p - 1)

= sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + sum over p=0 to k-1 of p

= sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + k*(k-1)/2

So, the total cost is the sum of a_{d(p)} for all p, plus k*(k-1)/2.

Wait, this seems interesting.

So, total cost = sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + k*(k-1)/2

But sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} is the sum of the a_i's for the days on which the tickets are bought.

Wait, but each day can have multiple tickets.

Wait, no.

Actually, in this formulation, d(p) is the day on which the p-th ticket is bought.

So, sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} is the sum of a_i for each ticket bought on day i, considering the day it's bought.

But in reality, the price for the p-th ticket is a_{d(p)} plus the number of tickets bought before it.

Wait, no.

Earlier, I thought that the price for the p-th ticket is a_{d(p)} plus (p - 1), but that's not accurate.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Each ticket bought on any day increases the price for all subsequent tickets by 1.

So, the total price for the p-th ticket is a_{d(p)} plus the number of tickets bought before it.

So, if I buy tickets in a certain order, the p-th ticket's price is a_{d(p)} plus (p - 1).

Therefore, total cost = sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + (p - 1)

= sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + sum over p=1 to k of (p - 1)

= sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + k*(k-1)/2

So, the total cost is the sum of a_{d(p)} for all p, plus k*(k-1)/2.

Therefore, to minimize the total cost, I need to minimize sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)}.

Given that, I should choose the days with the lowest a_i for buying the tickets.

But I have constraints:

- I can buy at most m tickets per day.

- I have to buy exactly k tickets.

So, the problem reduces to selecting k tickets from the available days, each day providing up to m tickets, and choosing the days with the lowest a_i.

In other words, it's like selecting k items with the lowest costs, each type (day) having up to m identical items.

So, I can think of it as having n days, each day offering m tickets with cost a_i, and I need to choose k such tickets, minimizing the sum of their a_i's.

Then, the minimal sum of a_i's would be the sum of the k smallest a_i's, each repeated up to m times.

Wait, but with the constraint that I can't buy more than m tickets from any single day.

So, it's like selecting k items from n groups, each group having m identical items with cost a_i, and I can't select more than m items from any group.

This is similar to selecting k smallest elements from a multiset where each element a_i appears m times, but with the restriction that I can't select more than m copies of a_i.

So, to minimize sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)}, I need to select the k smallest a_i's, respecting the m limit per day.

Therefore, the minimal sum of a_{d(p)} is the sum of the k smallest a_i's, where I can select up to m a_i's for each day.

In other words, sort all possible ticket choices in ascending order of a_i, considering that each day can contribute up to m tickets.

Then, pick the first k tickets from this sorted list.

So, in code, I can sort all possible tickets based on a_i, and pick the k smallest a_i's, respecting the m limit per day.

This can be done by sorting the days based on a_i, and assigning as many tickets as possible to the days with the smallest a_i, up to m per day.

Then, sum up these a_i's multiplied by the number of tickets bought on that day.

Finally, add k*(k-1)/2 to this sum to get the total cost.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I had total cost = sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + k*(k-1)/2.

But in the first test case, sum of a_{d(p)} is 4 + 2 + 2 = 8, plus 3*2/2 = 3, total 11, but the correct answer is 10.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the first test case, sum of a_{d(p)} is 4 + 2 + 2 = 8, and k*(k-1)/2 = 3, total 11, but the correct answer is 10.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the optimal strategy, buying 1 ticket on day 3 (a=4) and 2 tickets on day 4 (a=2), so sum of a_{d(p)} is 4 + 2 + 2 = 8, and k*(k-1)/2 = 3, total 11, but the actual cost is 10.

So, my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is total cost = sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + (number of tickets bought before d(p)).

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me think again.

Each ticket bought before the p-th ticket increases the price of the p-th ticket by 1.

So, the p-th ticket's price is a_{d(p)} plus (p - 1), where p is the order in which tickets are bought.

Wait, but in the first test case, p=1: a_{d(1)} + 0, p=2: a_{d(2)} + 1, p=3: a_{d(3)} + 2.

But in the optimal strategy, buy 1 ticket on day 3: cost 4 + 0 = 4

Buy 2 tickets on day 4: costs 2 + 1 = 3, and 2 + 2 = 4

Total cost: 4 + 3 + 4 = 11, but the correct answer is 10.

Wait, but in the earlier explanation, it was 4 + 6 = 10.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, in the optimal strategy, buy 0 on day 1, 0 on day 2, 1 on day 3, and 2 on day 4.

So, the first ticket is bought on day 3: cost = 4 + 0 = 4

Then, the second ticket is bought on day 4: cost = 2 + 1 = 3

The third ticket is bought on day 4: cost = 2 + 2 = 4

Total cost: 4 + 3 + 4 = 11, but the correct answer is 10.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the ordering of p is based on the sequence of purchases.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the p-th ticket is the one bought at position p in the sequence of all ticket purchases.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + s_{d(p)-1}, where s_{d(p)-1} is the total tickets bought before day d(p).

In the first test case:

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3: s_{2} = 0 (since bought 0 on day 1 and 2)

Cost: 4 + 0 = 4

- Buy 2 tickets on day 4: s_{3} = 1 (since bought 1 on day 3)

Costs: 2 + 1 = 3 and 2 + 1 = 3

Wait, but in the earlier explanation, it was 4 + 6 = 10.

Wait, perhaps the second ticket on day 4 has s_{3} = 1 for the first ticket, and s_{3} = 2 for the second ticket.

Wait, no, s_i is the sum up to day i-1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to formalize it properly.

Let’s define s_i = sum over j=1 to i of x_j

So, s_0 = 0, s_1 = x_1, s_2 = x_1 + x_2, etc.

Then, the cost for buying x_i tickets on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

So, in the first test case:

- x_1 = 0, s_0 = 0, cost = 0 * (8 + 0) = 0

- x_2 = 0, s_1 = 0, cost = 0 * (6 + 0) = 0

- x_3 = 1, s_2 = 0, cost = 1 * (4 + 0) = 4

- x_4 = 2, s_3 = 1, cost = 2 * (2 + 1) = 6

Total cost: 4 + 6 = 10

So, total cost = sum over i of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) = 10

Now, in my earlier assumption, I thought total cost = sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + (p - 1)

But in this case, sum over p=1 to k of a_{d(p)} + (p - 1) = 4 + (0) + 2 + (1) + 2 + (2) = 4 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 11, which doesn't match the actual total cost of 10.

So, my assumption is incorrect.

Therefore, I need to find another way to compute the total cost.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum over i of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Given that, and s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i, with s_0 = 0

I need to minimize sum over i of x_i * a_i + x_i * s_{i-1}

Let’s try to express this sum in a different way.

Sum over i of x_i * a_i + x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1}

Now, sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of x_i * (sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j) = sum over 1 <= j < i <= n of x_i * x_j

This seems like the sum of products of all pairs of x_j and x_i where j < i.

This is equal to (sum over i of x_i)^2 - sum over i of x_i^2 / 2

Wait, not sure about that.

Actually, sum over 1 <= j < i <= n of x_i * x_j = (sum over i x_i)^2 - sum over i x_i^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, sum over 1 <= j < i <= n of x_i * x_j = (sum over i x_i)^2 - sum over i x_i^2 / 2

Wait, actually, sum over j=1 to n sum over i=1 to n x_i x_j = (sum x_i)^2

Sum over i x_i^2 is the sum of squares.

Sum over j < i x_i x_j = (sum x_i)^2 - sum x_i^2 / 2

Wait, no, that's not accurate.

Actually, sum over j < i x_i x_j = (sum x_i)^2 - sum x_i^2 / 2 - sum x_i^2 / 2 = (sum x_i)^2 - sum x_i^2

Wait, let's think carefully.

sum over i sum over j x_i x_j = (sum x_i)^2

sum over i x_i^2 is the sum of squares.

sum over j < i x_i x_j = (sum x_i)^2 - sum x_i^2

But divided by 2.

Wait, no.

Actually, sum over j < i x_i x_j = 1/2 [ (sum x_i)^2 - sum x_i^2 ]

Because sum over j < i x_i x_j + sum over i < j x_i x_j = (sum x_i)^2 - sum x_i^2

So, sum over j < i x_i x_j = 1/2 [ (sum x_i)^2 - sum x_i^2 ]

Therefore, sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of x_i * (sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j) = sum over j < i x_i x_j = 1/2 [ (sum x_i)^2 - sum x_i^2 ]

So, total cost = sum x_i a_i + 1/2 [ k^2 - sum x_i^2 ]

Given that sum x_i = k.

So, total cost = sum x_i a_i + 1/2 [ k^2 - sum x_i^2 ]

I need to minimize this.

Given that, perhaps I can rearrange this to find a better way to minimize it.

Let me see.

Total cost = sum x_i a_i + 1/2 k^2 - 1/2 sum x_i^2

So, to minimize total cost, I need to minimize sum x_i a_i - 1/2 sum x_i^2

Because 1/2 k^2 is constant.

Wait, no, 1/2 k^2 is constant, yes.

So, I need to minimize sum x_i a_i - 1/2 sum x_i^2

Wait, but sum x_i = k.

This seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as minimizing sum x_i (a_i + s_{i-1}) where s_{i-1} is determined by previous x_j's.
