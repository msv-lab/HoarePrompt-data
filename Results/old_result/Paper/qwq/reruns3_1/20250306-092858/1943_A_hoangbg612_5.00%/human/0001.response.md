Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to find the final score based on their optimal plays. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the game:

- There's an array `a` of size `n`, and Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

- Players take turns, with Alice going first.

- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a`, deletes it from `a`, but doesn't add it to `c`.

- The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

So, the goal is to find the final MEX when both play optimally.

Let me think about how MEX is calculated. MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array. For example:

- If `c = [0, 1, 3]`, MEX is 2.

- If `c = [0, 1, 2]`, MEX is 3.

- If `c = [1, 2, 3]`, MEX is 0.

Wait, in the note, they have `c = [1, 0]`, MEX is 2. That makes sense because 0 and 1 are present, so 2 is the smallest missing.

Now, since Alice wants to maximize MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, it's a zero-sum game scenario. I need to find the equilibrium point where neither can do better against an optimal opponent.

Let me consider the process:

1. The total number of elements in `c` will be `(n + 1) // 2`, since Alice picks every other element starting first.

2. Bob can influence which elements go into `c` by choosing which elements to remove on his turns.

Wait, actually, Bob just removes elements from `a`, but doesn't add them to `c`. So, Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice might want for a higher MEX.

But, more carefully:

- Alice picks an element to add to `c` and removes it from `a`.

- Bob picks an element to remove from `a`, not adding to `c`.

So, in total, `(n + 1) // 2` elements will be added to `c` by Alice, because she picks first and they alternate.

Wait, no. Let's think about the number of turns:

- Total elements: `n`.

- Each turn, one element is removed from `a`, either by Alice or Bob.

- Alice goes first, and on her turn, she picks and adds to `c`, then removes it.

- Bob goes next, picks and just removes it.

So, in total, `n` turns, alternating between Alice and Bob.

- Alice's turns: pick and add to `c`, then remove.

- Bob's turns: pick and remove, don't add to `c`.

So, the number of elements in `c` will be the number of Alice's turns.

- If `n` is even, Alice and Bob each have `n/2` turns.

- If `n` is odd, Alice has `(n + 1)/2` turns, Bob has `(n - 1)/2` turns.

So, size of `c` will be ceil(n / 2).

Wait, more precisely:

- Total turns: `n`.

- Alice plays on turns 1, 3, 5, ..., i.e., every odd-numbered turn.

- Bob plays on turns 2, 4, 6, ..., i.e., every even-numbered turn.

- So, if `n` is even, both have `n/2` turns.

- If `n` is odd, Alice has `n/2 + 0.5` turns, but since turns are integer, Alice has `(n + 1) // 2` turns.

So, size of `c` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

Now, the problem reduces to selecting `(n + 1) // 2` elements from `a`, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob trying to minimize it.

Wait, but they play alternately, so the selection is interleaved.

This seems like a game where Alice chooses elements to maximize MEX, and Bob tries to disrupt that.

I need to find the MEX of the array `c` that results from both playing optimally.

Let me consider some small examples to get an intuition.

Example 1:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

Output:

2

Explanation:

A possible game:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0,0,1]

- Bob picks 0, a = [0,1]

- Alice picks 0, c = [1,0], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

Final c = [1,0], MEX = 2.

But is this the optimal? Let's see.

Another game:

- Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [0,1,1]

- Bob picks 1, a = [0,1]

- Alice picks 1, c = [0,1], a = [0]

- Bob picks 0, a = []

Again, c = [0,1], MEX = 2.

Seems consistent.

Another possible game:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0,0,1]

- Bob picks 1, a = [0,0]

- Alice picks 0, c = [1,0], a = [0]

- Bob picks 0, a = []

Again, c = [1,0], MEX = 2.

So, in this case, MEX is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

4

0 1 2 3

Output:

1

Possible game:

- Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a = [2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c = [0,2], a = [3]

- Bob picks 3, a = []

c = [0,2], MEX = 1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a = [2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c = [1,2], a = [3]

- Bob picks 3, a = []

c = [1,2], MEX = 0.

Wait, but according to the output, it's 1. So, 1 is the optimal MEX.

Wait, perhaps in this case, MEX can be 1.

Wait, c = [0,2], MEX = 1.

c = [1,2], MEX = 0.

So, MEX = 1 is better for Alice, so that's the optimal.

Example 3:

Input:

2

1 1

Output:

0

Possible game:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

c = [1], MEX = 0.

Another game:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

Same result.

So, MEX is 0.

Now, I need to generalize this.

I need to find, given `n` and the array `a`, the MEX of `c` when both play optimally.

Let me think about what determines the MEX.

The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to have as many small integers in `c` as possible.

Bob, wanting to minimize MEX, would try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

Given that, Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice might want to include in `c`.

But, since Bob doesn't add to `c`, his removals can limit Alice's choices.

I need to model this interaction.

Let me consider that the game is about selecting `(n + 1) // 2` elements out of `n`, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX of her selected set, and Bob trying to minimize it.

This seems similar to a selection game where one player wants to achieve a certain property, and the other tries to hinder it.

I need to find the MEX that Alice can guarantee, no matter how Bob plays.

Alternatively, think of it as a game where Alice selects elements to include in `c`, and Bob selects elements to exclude from `c`.

Wait, actually, Bob's removals directly remove elements from `a`, which might be candidates for Alice to include in `c`.

So, Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice wants, forcing her to pick less desirable elements.

This seems complex. Maybe I need to think in terms of availability of elements at each step.

Let me try to think in terms of the frequency of each number in `a`.

Let's count the frequency of each number in `a`.

Let me sort the numbers and see how many times each number appears.

Then, consider that Alice wants to include as many small numbers as possible in `c`, while Bob tries to prevent that.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a game where for each number, Alice and Bob have certain preferences.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

Suppose I have the frequency count of each number in `a`.

Then, Alice will try to include as many small numbers as possible in `c`, but Bob can remove some of them.

I need to see, for each number, how many times it can be included in `c`, considering that Bob can remove some instances.

Let me consider that each number has a certain number of copies, and Alice and Bob take turns picking elements, with Alice trying to include them in `c` and Bob trying to prevent them.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick a number before Bob can remove all its occurrences.

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the game is equivalent to Alice selecting `(n + 1) // 2` elements, and Bob selecting the remaining `n - (n + 1) // 2` elements.

Wait, but in reality, Bob doesn't select elements to include anywhere; he just removes them from `a`.

But in terms of the final set `c`, it's Alice who decides what goes into `c`.

Wait, no, Alice decides what goes into `c` by picking and adding them, but Bob can remove elements that Alice might want to pick later.

This is getting messy.

Let me try to think about it in another way.

Suppose I have the sorted array `a`.

I can simulate the game by considering the order in which elements are picked by Alice and Bob.

Since Alice starts, she picks first, then Bob, and so on.

I need to track which elements are picked by Alice and added to `c`.

Then, at the end, compute the MEX of `c`.

But simulating the game for each test case would be too slow because `n` can be up to 2e5, and `t` up to 2e4, so total n across all test cases is up to 2e5.

But I need a smarter way to compute the MEX without simulating each move.

Let me think about what determines the MEX.

The MEX is determined by the presence of numbers 0, 1, 2, ... in `c`.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to have as many small numbers in `c` as possible.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having small numbers in `c`.

So, for each small number, Bob will try to remove it from `a` so that Alice cannot include it in `c`.

Alice, knowing this, will try to protect the small numbers by including them in `c`.

Given that, I need to find out which small numbers Alice can guarantee to include in `c`, despite Bob's efforts to remove them.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

Suppose a number `x` appears `f[x]` times in `a`.

Alice wants to include `x` in `c` as many times as possible.

Bob wants to remove `x` from `a` to prevent Alice from including it.

Each time Alice picks `x` and adds it to `c`, she removes one occurrence of `x` from `a`.

Each time Bob picks `x`, he removes one occurrence of `x` from `a`, without adding to `c`.

So, for each `x`, the number of times it can be included in `c` is `ceil(f[x] / 2)`.

Because for every two occurrences, Alice can include one (since she picks first).

If `f[x]` is odd, Alice can include one more.

Wait, but this might not be entirely accurate because the picks are interleaved.

Wait, perhaps for each `x`, the number of times Alice can include it in `c` is `ceil(f[x] / 2)`.

Because for each pair of occurrences, Alice and Bob can each take one.

If `f[x]` is odd, Alice gets the extra one.

So, total times Alice can include `x` in `c` is `ceil(f[x] / 2)`.

Is that correct?

Let's test with `f[x] = 1`: Alice picks it, includes in `c`.

With `f[x] = 2`: Alice picks one, includes in `c`; Bob picks the other, removes it.

So, only one inclusion in `c`.

With `f[x] = 3`: Alice picks one, includes in `c`; Bob picks one, removes it; Alice picks the last one, includes in `c`.

So, two inclusions in `c`.

Which is `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.

Similarly, `f[x] = 4`: Alice includes two, Bob removes two.

So, yes, `ceil(f[x] / 2)` seems correct.

So, for each `x`, the number of times it can be included in `c` is `ceil(f[x] / 2)`.

Given that, the total number of times each `x` appears in `c` is `ceil(f[x] / 2)`.

Then, to find the MEX, we need to see the smallest `x` where the number of times `x` appears in `c` is less than the required amount to keep MEX higher.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Given that Alice can include `ceil(f[x] / 2)` of each `x` in `c`, I need to see the smallest `x` where `ceil(f[x] / 2)` is less than what's needed to have enough `x` in `c` for a higher MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through `x` from 0 upwards, and see if Alice can include at least one `x` in `c`.

If she can, then `x` is present in `c`, and MEX is higher.

If she cannot, then `x` is not present in `c`, and MEX is `x`.

But, more precisely, I need to ensure that for MEX to be `k`, all numbers from 0 to `k-1` must be present in `c`, and `k` must be missing.

So, I need to find the smallest `k` such that either one of the following is true:

- Some `x` in 0 to `k-1` has `ceil(f[x]/2) == 0`, meaning Alice cannot include any `x` in `c`.

- The total number of elements Alice includes from 0 to `k-1` is less than `k`, meaning she doesn't have all numbers from 0 to `k-1` in `c`.

Wait, perhaps I need to accumulate the sum of `ceil(f[x]/2)` for `x` from 0 to some `k-1`, and see if it's at least `k`.

If it is, then MEX can be at least `k`.

Otherwise, MEX is `k`.

But I need to maximize MEX, so I need to find the largest `k` where the sum of `ceil(f[x]/2)` for `x` from 0 to `k-1` is at least `k`.

Then, MEX would be `k`.

Wait, but I need to find the smallest `k` where this condition fails.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the smallest `k` such that the sum of `ceil(f[x]/2)` for `x` from 0 to `k-1` is less than `k`.

Because if that sum is less than `k`, it means Alice cannot have all numbers from 0 to `k-1` in `c`, so MEX is `k`.

Otherwise, MEX is at least `k`.

So, I need to find the smallest `k` where sum of `ceil(f[x]/2)` for `x` from 0 to `k-1` is less than `k`.

That would be the MEX.

Wait, but in the first test case:

a = [0,0,1,1]

f[0] = 2, ceil(2/2) = 1

f[1] = 2, ceil(2/2) = 1

So, for k=2:

sum for x from 0 to 1: 1 + 1 = 2, which is equal to k=2.

So, MEX is greater than or equal to 2.

But in the example, MEX is 2.

In the second test case:

a = [0,1,2,3]

f[0]=1, ceil(1/2)=1

f[1]=1, ceil(1/2)=1

f[2]=1, ceil(1/2)=1

f[3]=1, ceil(1/2)=1

For k=1:

sum for x from 0 to 0: 1, which is equal to k=1.

For k=2:

sum for x from 0 to 1: 1 + 1 = 2, equal to k=2.

For k=3:

sum for x from 0 to 2: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, equal to k=3.

For k=4:

sum for x from 0 to 3: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, equal to k=4.

But in the example, MEX is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the size of `c`.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, so size of `c` is ceil(4/2)=2.

So, Alice can include 2 elements in `c`.

In the example, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

But according to my earlier logic, sum of ceil(f[x]/2) for x from 0 to k-1 should be compared to k.

For k=1:

sum for x=0: ceil(1/2)=1, which equals k=1.

For k=2:

sum for x=0 to 1: 1 + 1 = 2, equals k=2.

But in reality, MEX is 1.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to consider that the total number of elements Alice can include from 0 to k-1 is sum of ceil(f[x]/2), and compare it to k.

But in this case, sum is equal to k for k=1 and k=2, but MEX is 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the sum of ceil(f[x]/2) for x from 0 to k-1 is less than the size of `c`.

Wait, in the second test case:

size of `c` is 2.

sum for k=1: sum for x=0: 1, which is less than 2.

So, MEX is 1.

Wait, but according to the example, MEX is 1.

Wait, perhaps that's it.

So, the condition is:

Find the smallest k such that sum of ceil(f[x]/2) for x from 0 to k-1 < size of c.

Then, MEX is k.

In the second test case:

size of c is 2.

sum for k=1: sum for x=0: 1 < 2, so MEX=1.

In the first test case:

size of c is 2.

sum for k=1: sum for x=0: 1 < 2, so MEX=1, but in the example, MEX is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to accumulate the sum until it's greater than or equal to k.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the smallest k where sum of ceil(f[x]/2) for x from 0 to k-1 < k.

In the first test case:

k=1: sum for x=0: 1 < 1? No, 1 >= 1.

k=2: sum for x=0 to 1: 1 + 1 = 2 >= 2.

k=3: sum for x=0 to 2: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 < 3.

So, MEX is 3, but in the example, MEX is 2.

Wait, doesn't match.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the size of `c` is limited, and ensure that Alice can include enough small numbers in `c`.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through k from 0 upwards, and for each k, check if the sum of ceil(f[x]/2) for x from 0 to k-1 is greater than or equal to k.

If it is, then MEX is at least k.

Otherwise, MEX is k.

But in the first test case, for k=2: sum=2 >=2, so MEX >=2.

For k=3: sum=2 <3, so MEX=3, but example shows MEX=2.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the smallest k where sum of ceil(f[x]/2) for x from 0 to k-1 < k, and also ensure that the remaining elements in c can be filled with numbers greater than or equal to k.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the total size of c.

Let me think differently.

Let me sort the unique numbers in a and see the frequency.

Then, for each k, check if Alice can include at least one of each x from 0 to k-1 in c.

If she can, then MEX is at least k.

Otherwise, MEX is k.

But, Alice can include ceil(f[x]/2) of each x.

So, for MEX to be k, she needs to include at least one of each x from 0 to k-1.

So, for each x from 0 to k-1, ceil(f[x]/2) >=1.

Wait, ceil(f[x]/2) >=1 implies f[x] >=1.

But that's not necessarily true.

Wait, ceil(f[x]/2) >=1 means f[x] >=1.

So, if f[x] >=1, then ceil(f[x]/2) >=1.

So, for each x from 0 to k-1, if f[x] >=1, then Alice can include at least one in c.

Otherwise, if f[x] ==0, then Alice cannot include it.

So, MEX is the smallest k where either f[k] ==0 or, if f[k] >=1, but Alice cannot include it in c.

Wait, but if f[k] >=1, Alice can include ceil(f[k]/2) >=1, so she can include it.

So, MEX is the smallest k where f[k] ==0.

But in the second test case, f[0]=1, f[1]=1, f[2]=1, f[3]=1.

So, MEX should be 4, but in the example, it's 1.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice has to include enough small numbers in c, considering that Bob can remove some.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the total number of elements Alice can include from 0 to k-1.

Let me define:

For a given k, the number of elements Alice can include from 0 to k-1 is sum of ceil(f[x]/2) for x from 0 to k-1.

The total size of c is ceil(n / 2).

For MEX to be at least k, Alice needs to include at least one of each x from 0 to k-1 in c.

Wait, but for MEX to be k, Alice must have all x from 0 to k-1 in c.

So, for each x from 0 to k-1, ceil(f[x]/2) >=1.

And the total sum of ceil(f[x]/2) for x from 0 to k-1 >= k.

Wait, but in the second test case, for k=2:

sum = ceil(1/2) + ceil(1/2) =1 +1=2 >=2.

But in reality, MEX is 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the sum of ceil(f[x]/2) for x from 0 to k-1 >=k, and also that the remaining elements in c can be filled with higher numbers.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that sum of ceil(f[x]/2) for x from 0 to k-1 >=k, and that the total elements Alice can include from 0 to infinity is at least ceil(n / 2).

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can control ceil(f[x]/2) instances of each x.

Bob can control floor(f[x]/2).

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she wants to have as many small x in c as possible.

Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having small x in c.

So, for each x, if Alice can include at least one in c, then x is in c.

Otherwise, x is not in c.

So, for MEX to be k, all x from 0 to k-1 must be in c, and k must not be in c.

So, to have MEX > k, Alice must have all x from 0 to k in c.

Wait, MEX is the smallest x not in c.

So, to have MEX >=k, Alice must have all x from 0 to k-1 in c.

So, the condition for MEX >=k is that for all x from 0 to k-1, ceil(f[x]/2) >=1.

Which is equivalent to f[x] >=1.

Because ceil(f[x]/2) >=1 if and only if f[x] >=1.

So, MEX is the smallest k where f[k] ==0.

But in the second test case, f[0]=1, f[1]=1, f[2]=1, f[3]=1.

So, f[k] >=1 for k=0,1,2,3.

So, MEX should be 4, but in the example, it's 1.

So, my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that even if f[x] >=1, Bob can remove all instances of x except zero, preventing Alice from including any in c.

Wait, but ceil(f[x]/2) >=1 if f[x] >=1.

Wait, no, if f[x] ==1, ceil(1/2)=1, so Alice includes it.

But in the second test case, Alice can include two elements in c.

So, she can include 0 and 1, making c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But in the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can force Alice to include certain elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at it differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include ceil(f[x]/2) of each x.

So, in the second test case:

x=0: ceil(1/2)=1

x=1: ceil(1/2)=1

x=2: ceil(1/2)=1

x=3: ceil(1/2)=1

So, Alice can include one of each.

But size of c is 2.

So, she can choose any two to include.

So, she can choose 0 and 1, making c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But in the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can force Alice to include certain elements.

Wait, perhaps Bob can remove elements in such a way that Alice is forced to include elements that don't maximize the MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to remove elements that Alice wants to include.

So, if Alice wants to include 0 and 1, Bob can remove one of them, forcing Alice to include something else.

Wait, in the second test case:

- Alice picks 0, includes in c, removes from a.

- Bob picks 1, removes from a.

- Alice picks 2, includes in c, removes from a.

- Bob picks 3, removes from a.

So, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, includes in c, removes from a.

- Bob picks 0, removes from a.

- Alice picks 2, includes in c, removes from a.

- Bob picks 3, removes from a.

c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, in this case, MEX can be 1 or 0, depending on the choices.

But according to the example, it's 1.

So, perhaps MEX is the minimum over all possible games.

Wait, no, it's that both play optimally.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

So, I need to find the MEX when both play optimally.

So, in this case, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps
