Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows a value a_i. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order of their values, meaning from largest to smallest. If two cubes have the same value, their order relative to each other can be anything.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among the removed ones.

Looking at the example:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]

After sorting, it could be [4, 3, 3, 3, 2] or [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], etc., depending on how the same values are ordered.

If it's [4, 3, 3, 3, 2], and k=2, he removes the first two cubes: 4 and 3. The favorite cube was originally at position 2 (0-indexed, so index 1), which had value 3. In this sorting, it's in position 2 (index 1), which is not removed.

But in another sorting, say [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], the favorite cube might be in position 3 (index 2), which is not removed.

Wait, in the first sorting, [4, 3, 3, 3, 2], removing first two: 4 and 3. The favorite cube was originally at index 1 with value 3, which is now at index 1 in the sorted list, so it's removed.

In the second sorting, [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], the favorite cube is at index 1 originally, value 3, now it's at index 2, which is not removed.

So, in some sortings, it's removed, in others, it's not. Hence, the answer is "MAYBE".

I need to generalize this.

First, I need to understand the possible positions of the favorite cube after sorting.

Given that sorting is in non-increasing order, and that equal elements can be in any order.

So, for a given value x = a[f], I need to find the possible positions it can occupy after sorting.

I need to find the range of positions where the favorite cube could end up.

To do this, I need to find the minimum and maximum possible positions for x in the sorted list.

Then, I need to check if k (the number of cubes removed) is greater than or equal to the maximum possible position, in which case it's always removed, or less than the minimum possible position, in which case it's never removed, or somewhere in between, meaning it could be removed or not, hence "MAYBE".

So, how do I find the minimum and maximum possible positions for x after sorting?

Let's think about the sorted list in non-increasing order.

First, count how many elements are strictly greater than x, how many are equal to x, and how many are less than x.

Letâ€™s denote:

- num_greater: number of elements strictly greater than x

- num_equal: number of elements equal to x

- num_less: number of elements less than x

Given that, in the sorted list, the elements will be arranged with num_greater elements first, then num_equal elements, and then num_less elements.

Now, within the num_equal elements, their relative order is arbitrary.

So, the favorite cube, which has value x, can be in any position among the num_equal elements.

The first position where x can appear is after the num_greater elements, i.e., position num_greater.

The last position where x can appear is position num_greater + num_equal - 1.

But since the list is 0-indexed, positions are from 0 to n-1.

So, the minimum position of x is num_greater

The maximum position of x is num_greater + num_equal - 1

Now, since the sorting is in non-increasing order, the positions are from 0 to n-1, with 0 being the largest.

So, if k > max_position, meaning k is larger than the highest possible position of x, then x will always be removed.

Wait, no.

Wait, he removes the first k cubes, which are the largest k cubes.

So, if the position of x is less than k, meaning it's among the first k, it's removed.

So, if the maximum possible position of x is less than k, then it's always removed.

If the minimum possible position of x is greater than or equal to k, then it's never removed.

If the range overlaps with k, then it's "MAYBE".

Wait, let's clarify.

If the maximum position of x is less than k, then x is always removed.

If the minimum position of x is greater than or equal to k, then x is never removed.

Otherwise, it's "MAYBE".

Wait, but positions are from 0 to n-1, with 0 being the largest.

k is the number of cubes removed from the beginning, i.e., positions 0 to k-1.

So, if the position of x is less than k, it's removed.

If it's greater than or equal to k, it's not removed.

Given that, if the maximum possible position of x is less than k, then x is always removed.

If the minimum possible position of x is greater than or equal to k, then x is never removed.

Otherwise, it's "MAYBE".

Wait, but in the example, n=5, f=2, k=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3]

x = 3

num_greater = number of elements > 3, which is 1 (the 4)

num_equal = number of elements == 3, which is 3

num_less = number of elements < 3, which is 1 (the 2)

So, positions:

min_position = num_greater = 1

max_position = num_greater + num_equal -1 = 1 + 3 -1 = 3

k = 2

So, min_position =1, max_position=3, k=2

Since min_position < k <= max_position, it's "MAYBE"

Because sometimes it's position 1 or 2 (removed), sometimes position 3 (not removed)

Another example in the question is:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

x=5

num_greater=0 (no element >5)

num_equal=1 (only one 5)

num_less=4

min_position=0

max_position=0

k=3

Since max_position=0 < k=3, so x is always removed. Hence "YES"

Wait, but in the sample output, it's "YES"

Wait, but according to my logic, if max_position < k, then it's always removed, so "YES"

Wait, but in the earlier case, it was "MAYBE"

So, seems consistent.

Another sample input:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

x=5

num_greater=0

num_equal=1

num_less=4

min_position=0

max_position=0

k=2

Since max_position=0 < k=2, x is always removed. So "YES"

Another sample:

5 5 5

1 2 5 4 3

x=5

num_greater=0

num_equal=1

num_less=4

min_position=0

max_position=0

k=5

max_position=0 < k=5, so always removed. "YES"

Another sample:

5 5 4

3 1 2 4 5

x=5

num_greater=0

num_equal=1

num_less=4

min_position=0

max_position=0

k=4

max_position=0 < k=4, so always removed. "YES"

Another sample:

5 5 5

4 3 2 1 5

x=5

num_greater=0

num_equal=1

num_less=4

min_position=0

max_position=0

k=5

max_position=0 < k=5, always removed. "YES"

Another sample:

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

x=3

num_greater=2 (two 3's)

Wait, no.

Wait, a=[1,2,3,1,2,3], f=5, so x=3

num_greater=1 (only one 3, but wait, num_greater should be number of elements > x=3, which are none.

Wait, a=[1,2,3,1,2,3], x=3

num_greater=0 (no elements >3)

num_equal=2 (two 3's)

num_less=4 (four elements <3)

min_position=0

max_position=1

k=3

So, min_position=0, max_position=1, k=3

min_position=0 < k=3, and max_position=1 < k=3, wait, no.

Wait, max_position=1 < k=3, so always removed. "YES"

But in the sample output, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, a=[1,2,3,1,2,3], x=3

num_greater=0 (no elements >3)

num_equal=2 (two 3's)

num_less=4 (four elements <3)

So, sorted list: [3,3,2,2,1,1]

So, positions of x=3 are 0 and 1.

k=3, removes positions 0,1,2.

So, x could be at position 0 or 1, both of which are removed.

Hence, always removed. So "YES"

But in the sample output, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, checking the sample input:

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

Output:

MAYBE

Wait, according to my logic, it should be "YES", but sample output is "MAYBE"

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted num_greater.

Wait, a=[1,2,3,1,2,3], x=3

num_greater: number of elements >3, which is 0.

num_equal: number of elements ==3, which is 2.

num_less: number of elements <3, which is 4.

So, positions of x can be 0 and 1.

k=3, removes positions 0,1,2.

So, x is always removed.

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the sorting can have different orders for equal elements.

Wait, but in this case, there are two 3's, and they can be in any order.

So, positions 0 and 1 are both removed.

Hence, always removed.

Wait, but sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my logic.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the favorite cube could be any of the equal elements.

But in this case, both positions 0 and 1 are removed, so it's always removed.

Wait, perhaps the sample output is wrong, or I misread it.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

NO

In the case of 6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

Output: MAYBE

But according to my logic, it should be "YES"

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps if there are multiple elements equal to x, their relative order is arbitrary, but the positions they occupy are fixed.

Wait, in the sorted list, all elements >= x come before elements < x.

Wait, no, it's non-increasing order.

So, all elements >= x come first, in some order.

Then elements < x come later.

Within the >= x group, elements can be in any order relative to each other.

So, for x=3, in the sorted list, all elements >=3 come first, in some order.

Then elements <3 come later.

So, in this case, elements >=3 are two 3's and two 2's.

Wait, no, elements >=3 are two 3's and two 2's?

Wait, a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

Elements >=3 are two 3's.

Elements <3 are four elements: two 2's and two 1's.

So, sorted in non-increasing order: [3,3,2,2,1,1]

So, positions of x=3 are 0 and 1.

k=3, removes positions 0,1,2.

So, x is always removed.

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the elements equal to x can be in any order within their group.

But in this case, both 3's are in positions 0 and 1, both removed.

Hence, always removed.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the sample output.

Or perhaps I need to consider something else.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after sorting, the first k elements are removed, and I need to check if the favorite cube is among them.

Given that, if the favorite cube's value is such that all possible positions after sorting are within the first k, then "YES"

If none of the possible positions are within the first k, then "NO"

Else, "MAYBE"

So, in this case, for x=3, min_position=0, max_position=1, k=3

Since max_position=1 < k=3, wait no, k=3 means removes positions 0,1,2.

Wait, in 0-based indexing, positions 0 to k-1 are removed.

So, k=3, removes positions 0,1,2.

In this case, x can be at positions 0 or 1, both of which are removed.

Hence, always removed. "YES"

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps the interpretation is different.

Wait, maybe k is the number of cubes removed, not the position index.

Wait, no, it's the number of cubes removed from the beginning.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the sorting isn't strictly decreasing, it's non-increasing.

So, equal elements can be in any order within their group.

But in the case of x=3, and two 3's, their order is arbitrary.

But both are within the first two positions, which are removed when k=3.

Wait, but k=3 removes the first three cubes.

In the sorted list [3,3,2,2,1,1], positions 0,1,2 are removed.

So, both 3's are removed.

Hence, "YES"

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: "After sorting, he removed the first k cubes."

So, in the sorted list, the first k cubes are removed.

Hence, in the case where x can be in positions 0 to num_greater + num_equal -1, and if all those positions are <k, then always removed.

If none of those positions are <k, then never removed.

Else, "MAYBE"

Wait, in the earlier example:

n=5, f=2, k=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3]

x=3

num_greater=1 (only 4)

num_equal=3 (three 3's)

num_less=1 (one 2)

So, positions of x are from 1 to 3.

k=2, removes positions 0 and 1.

So, x can be at positions 1,2,3.

Position 1 is removed, positions 2 and 3 are not.

Hence, "MAYBE"

Because in some cases, it's removed (if it's at position 1), in other cases, not removed (if it's at position 2 or 3).

Hence, "MAYBE"

Wait, but in the earlier case with n=6, f=5, k=3, a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

x=3

num_greater=0

num_equal=2

num_less=4

positions of x are 0 and 1.

k=3, removes positions 0,1,2.

Hence, x is always removed.

Hence, "YES"

But in the sample output, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Wait, checking the sample input and output again:

Input:

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

Output:

MAYBE

But according to my logic, it should be "YES"

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or sample output.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that after sorting, the first k elements are removed, but since equal elements can be in any order, their positions are not fixed.

Wait, but in the case where num_equal >=2, their positions among themselves are arbitrary.

But in the case of n=6, f=5, k=3, a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

x=3

After sorting, the list is [3,3,2,2,1,1]

The favorite cube, which was at index 4 (0-based, f=5), has value 3.

After sorting, it can be at position 0 or 1, both of which are removed.

Hence, always removed. "YES"

But sample output is "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps the favorite cube is not necessarily one of the 3's in the sorted list.

Wait, no, the favorite cube has value x=3, and after sorting, it's among the 3's.

Hence, its position is among the first num_greater + num_equal.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in 0-based vs 1-based indexing.

Wait, in the problem, f is 1-based index.

But in the sample input, f=5 for n=6.

So, f=5 means index 4 in 0-based.

a=[1,2,3,1,2,3], so a[4]=2.

Wait, ahh, here f=5, but a[4]=2.

Wait, in the sample input, f=5, but a[4]=2, which is not equal to x=3.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, perhaps I misread the input.

Wait, checking the sample input:

6 5 3

1 2 3 1 2 3

So, n=6, f=5, k=3

a=[1,2,3,1,2,3]

x=a[4]=2

Wait, so x=2

Then, num_greater: number of elements >2, which are two 3's

num_equal: number of elements ==2, which are two 2's

num_less: number of elements <2, which are two 1's

So, sorted list: [3,3,2,2,1,1]

Positions of x=2 are 2 and 3.

k=3, removes positions 0,1,2.

So, position 2 is removed, position 3 is not.

Hence, "MAYBE"

Because it could be at position 2 (removed) or position 3 (not removed).

Hence, "MAYBE"

I see, I misread f=5 as index 5 (0-based), but in 0-based, f=5 corresponds to index 4.

Wait, no, f=5, n=6, 1-based, so index 4 in 0-based.

But a[4]=2, not 3.

Hence, x=2.

In that case, positions of x=2 are 2 and 3 in sorted list.

k=3 removes positions 0,1,2.

Hence, "MAYBE"

Got it.

So, in this case, my initial logic needs adjustment.

I need to correctly identify x=a[f-1], since f is 1-based.

Then, count num_greater, num_equal
