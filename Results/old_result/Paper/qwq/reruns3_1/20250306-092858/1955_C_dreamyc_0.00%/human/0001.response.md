Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships, each with some durability a_i, and they're arranged in a sequence from 1 to n. The Kraken attacks these ships in a specific pattern: first the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. When a ship's durability drops to zero, it sinks and is removed from the sequence. The Kraken stops attacking once all ships have sunk or it has performed k attacks.

My task is to determine how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the process clearly. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and the last ship in the current sequence. After each attack, if a ship's durability reaches zero, it's removed from the sequence. This means that the sequence can shrink over time as ships are sunk.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and k can be up to 10^15, I need an efficient algorithm. A naive approach where I simulate each attack one by one would be too slow because of the large constraints.

I need to find a way to handle this efficiently. Let's think about the pattern of attacks.

The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and the last ship. So, in the first attack, it hits the first ship, in the second attack, it hits the last ship, in the third attack, it hits the first ship again, and so on.

I need to keep track of which ships are currently in the sequence and which ones have been sunk.

Using a deque seems like a good idea because it allows efficient operations at both ends, which is perfect for repeatedly removing from the front and the back.

Let me consider implementing a deque to hold the current sequence of ships, with their durabilities.

I'll need to perform k attacks, but I have to be careful because k can be up to 10^15, which is a very large number. So, I need a way to handle multiple attacks in batches to avoid iterating one by one.

Let me think about how to batch the attacks.

Each cycle consists of two attacks: one on the first ship and one on the last ship. So, in each cycle, two attacks are performed.

But I need to be careful because after each attack, a ship might be sunk and removed from the sequence, which could affect future attacks.

Wait, but if a ship is sunk, it's removed, so the sequence changes.

This makes it a bit tricky to batch the attacks because the sequence can change dynamically.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Use a deque to represent the current sequence of ships.

- Initialize a counter for the number of sunk ships.

- While k > 0 and there are at least two ships left in the deque:

- Attack the first ship and reduce its durability by 1.

- If its durability drops to zero, remove it from the deque and increment the sunk counter.

- Decrement k.

- If k > 0 and there are ships left in the deque:

- Attack the last ship and reduce its durability by 1.

- If its durability drops to zero, remove it from the deque and increment the sunk counter.

- Decrement k.

- After the loop, if k > 0 and there's one ship left:

- If k >= the durability of the remaining ship, sink it and increment the sunk counter.

- Finally, return the number of sunk ships.

This approach simulates each attack one by one, but since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^15, this could be too slow if n is large and k is close to 10^15.

I need a way to optimize this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I can find, for each pair of ships (first and last), how many attacks can be performed before one of them sinks.

Since the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship, I can consider that in each cycle of two attacks, the first and last ship each lose 1 durability.

So, for each cycle, the first and last ship's durabilities decrease by 1 each.

I can calculate how many such cycles can be performed before either the first or last ship's durability drops to zero.

Let's say the first ship has durability a and the last ship has durability b.

The number of cycles that can be performed before one of them sinks is min(a, b).

Each cycle consists of two attacks: one on the first ship and one on the last ship.

So, the number of attacks in these cycles is 2 * min(a, b).

If k is greater than or equal to 2 * min(a, b), then both ships will be sunk, and I can remove them from the sequence and subtract 2 * min(a, b) from k.

Then, I can repeat this process with the new first and last ships.

If k is less than 2 * min(a, b), then I need to perform individual attacks until k is exhausted.

This seems promising because it allows me to handle multiple attacks in batches, reducing the time complexity.

Let me formalize this approach:

- Use a deque to hold the sequence of ships' durabilities.

- Initialize a counter for sunk ships.

- While k > 0 and there are at least two ships left in the deque:

- Let a be the durability of the first ship and b be the durability of the last ship.

- Let x = min(a, b).

- If k >= 2 * x:

- Perform 2 * x attacks: x cycles of attacking first and last ships.

- Both ships are sunk because their durabilities are reduced by x.

- Remove both ships from the deque.

- Increment the sunk counter by 2.

- Subtract 2 * x from k.

- Else:

- Perform k attacks, alternating between the first and last ships.

- Keep track of how much durability is reduced for each ship.

- Remove ships if their durability drops to zero.

- Break the loop since further attacks can't be performed.

- If k > 0 and there's one ship left:

- If k >= the durability of the remaining ship:

- Sink it and increment the sunk counter by 1.

- Else:

- Reduce its durability by k, but it doesn't sink.

- Return the number of sunk ships.

This approach should be more efficient because in each iteration of the loop, I'm handling a batch of attacks instead of individual attacks.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge Case 1: n = 1, k = 1, a = [1]

- Kraken attacks the only ship once.

- The ship's durability drops to 0 and it sinks.

- Number of sunk ships: 1.

Edge Case 2: n = 1, k = 0, a = [1]

- No attacks are performed.

- Number of sunk ships: 0.

Edge Case 3: n = 2, k = 1, a = [1, 1]

- Attack the first ship: its durability drops to 0, it sinks.

- Now only the last ship remains.

- k is now 0, so no more attacks.

- Number of sunk ships: 1.

Edge Case 4: n = 2, k = 3, a = [1, 2]

- First attack: first ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks.

- Now only the last ship remains with durability 2.

- Since k = 2 still remains, attack the last ship twice.

- Its durability drops to 0, it sinks.

- Number of sunk ships: 2.

Edge Case 5: n = 3, k = 4, a = [1, 2, 3]

- First attack: first ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks.

- Sequence: [2, 3]

- Second attack: last ship's durability drops to 2.

- Sequence: [2, 2]

- Third attack: first ship's durability drops to 1.

- Sequence: [1, 2]

- Fourth attack: last ship's durability drops to 1.

- Sequence: [1, 1]

- k is now 0.

- Number of sunk ships: 0 (since no ship's durability reached 0).

Wait, but according to the problem, when a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed.

In this case, after the first attack, the first ship sinks and is removed.

Then, the sequence is [2, 3].

Second attack: last ship's durability drops to 2.

Third attack: first ship's durability drops to 1.

Fourth attack: last ship's durability drops to 1.

No ship's durability reaches 0, so no more ships sink.

So, number of sunk ships: 1.

But according to my earlier approach, I would have counted 1 sunk ship, which is correct.

Seems consistent.

Another Edge Case: n = 5, k = 10^15, a = [10^9, 10^9, 10^9, 10^9, 10^9]

- In each cycle of two attacks, the first and last ships lose 1 durability each.

- Since all ships have high durability, many cycles can be performed.

- Need to ensure that the algorithm doesn't iterate one by one but handles batches efficiently.

- In this case, the number of cycles that can be performed is min(a[0], a[4]), which is 10^9.

- So, 2 * 10^9 attacks are performed, sinking both the first and last ships.

- Then, the sequence becomes [10^9, 10^9, 10^9].

- Repeat the process: min(a[0], a[2]) = 10^9, so 2 * 10^9 attacks are performed, sinking the first and last ships.

- Sequence becomes [10^9].

- k is now 10^15 - 4 * 10^9 attacks have been performed.

- Since 10^15 is much larger than 4 * 10^9, continue.

- Finally, k is still large, and the last ship is attacked.

- If k >= a[0], it sinks.

- Total sunk ships: 5.

This seems correct.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given Program:

from collections import deque

T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

ans = func_1(n, k, nums)

print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):

nums = deque(nums)

ans = 0

while k and len(nums) >= 2:

(a, b) = (nums.popleft(), nums.pop())

x = min(a, b)

if k >= 2 * x:

a -= x

b -= x

k -= 2 * x

else:

break

if a > 0:

nums.appendleft(a)

else:

ans += 1

if b > 0:

nums.append(b)

else:

ans += 1

if k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]):

return ans + 1

return ans

Analyzing the provided program:

- It uses a deque to handle the sequence of ships.

- It defines a function func_1 to perform the calculations.

- In the while loop, it pops the first and last ships, gets the minimum durability x = min(a, b).

- If k >= 2 * x:

- It subtracts x from a and b.

- Subtracts 2 * x from k.

- If a > 0, appends it back to the front; else, increments ans.

- If b > 0, appends it back to the end; else, increments ans.

- After the loop, if k > 0 and one ship remains and k >= its durability, increments ans by 1.

- Returns the number of sunk ships.

Wait a minute, there's a potential issue here.

In the line:

if k >= 2 * x:

a -= x

b -= x

k -= 2 * x

else:

break

This seems to be reducing a and b by x, but a and b are local variables; the changes won't reflect back to the deque.

Wait, actually, a and b are just copies of the values from the deque; modifying a and b doesn't affect the deque.

So, after modifying a and b, it appends them back to the deque if they're greater than 0.

But, in the line:

a -= x

b -= x

This reduces a and b by x.

Then, if a > 0, it appends a back to the front of the deque.

Similarly for b.

This seems correct because it's simulating that both ships have been attacked x times, and if their durability is still positive, they remain in the sequence.

If a or b is <= 0 after the reduction, it means the ship has sunk, and it's not appended back to the deque, and ans is incremented.

This seems to align with the batch processing approach I was thinking of.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step-by-step simulation:

- Initial deque: [1,2,4,3]

- First iteration:

- a=1, b=3, x=min(1,3)=1

- Since k=5 >= 2*1=2:

- a=1-1=0, b=3-1=2

- k=5-2=3

- a=0, so don't append it back, ans=1

- b=2 >0, append it back: deque=[2,4,2]

- Second iteration:

- a=2, b=2, x=min(2,2)=2

- Since k=3 >= 2*2=4: wait, k=3 < 4, so break

- So, perform individual attacks:

- But the code doesn't seem to handle individual attacks in this block.

Wait, actually, in the provided code, if k < 2*x, it breaks out of the loop.

Then, it seems like it doesn't handle the case where k < 2*x but k is still greater than 0.

In the example, after the first iteration, k=3, deque=[2,4,2]

Then, a=2, b=2, x=2, but k=3 < 4, so break.

Then, it doesn't handle the remaining k attacks.

But in the problem description, after the first iteration, k=3, and the sequence is [2,4,2]

Then, it should perform individual attacks:

- Attack first ship: 2-1=1, deque=[1,4,2], k=2

- Attack last ship: 2-1=1, deque=[1,4,1], k=1

- Attack first ship: 1-1=0, sink it, ans=2, deque=[4,1], k=0

So, final ans=2

But in the code, after breaking out of the loop, it doesn't handle these remaining attacks.

It only checks if len(nums)==1 and k >= nums[0], then ans +=1

But in this case, len(nums)=2, so it just returns ans=1, which is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem's example, the output is 2.

So, the code seems incorrect because it returns 1, but the expected output is 2.

Wait, no, looking back, in the provided code, after the loop, it checks if k and len(nums)==1 and k >= nums[0], then ans +=1

But in this case, len(nums)=2, so it doesn't do anything and returns ans=1, which is wrong.

So, the code is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case when k < 2*x but k > 0 and len(nums) >=2.

It needs to handle individual attacks in that scenario.

Another issue: in the first iteration, a=1, b=3, x=1, k=5 >=2*1=2

Then a=0, b=2, k=3

ans +=1 (for a=0)

b=2 >0, append it back.

Then deque=[2,4,2]

Second iteration:

a=2, b=2, x=2

k=3 < 2*2=4, so break.

Then, it seems like there's remaining k=3, but it doesn't handle it.

It should handle the remaining k attacks by attacking the first and last ships alternately until k=0 or no ships are left.

So, the provided code is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case when k < 2*x but k >0 and len(nums)>=2.

It needs to perform individual attacks in that case.

Let me think about how to fix this.

One way is:

- While k >0 and len(nums) >=2:

- If k >= 2*x:

- Perform 2*x attacks: reduce a and b by x, k -=2*x

- If a >0, append a back; else, ans +=1

- If b >0, append b back; else, ans +=1

- Else:

- Perform k attacks, alternating between first and last ships.

- For each attack:

- Attack the first ship:

- If its durability >0:

- Reduce its durability by 1

- If its durability becomes 0, remove it and ans +=1

- Else, it's already sunk, so skip

- Then, if k >0 and len(nums) >=1:

- Attack the last ship:

- If its durability >0:

- Reduce its durability by 1

- If its durability becomes 0, remove it and ans +=1

- Else, it's already sunk, so skip

- And so on, until k=0 or no ships are left.

This way, we handle batch attacks when possible and fall back to individual attacks when k < 2*x.

I need to modify the code to include this logic.

But in the provided code, it doesn't handle the remaining k attacks when k < 2*x.

So, it's incorrect.

Another issue: in the while loop, it assumes that after reducing a and b by x, they are appended back only if >0.

But in the example, after the first iteration, a=0, b=2, so append b=2 back, ans=1.

Then, in the second iteration, a=2, b=2, x=2, but k=3 <4, so break.

Then, it should perform individual attacks:

- Attack first ship: a=2-1=1, append back, k=2

- Attack last ship: b=2-1=1, append back, k=1

- Attack first ship: a=1-1=0, don't append back, ans=2, k=0

So, final ans=2, which matches the expected output.

But the provided code doesn't do this.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Another test case:

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Following the same steps:

First iteration:

a=1, b=3, x=1, k=6 >=2*1=2

a=0, b=2, k=6-2=4

ans=1

append b=2 back: deque=[2,4,2]

Second iteration:

a=2, b=2, x=2, k=4 >=4

a=0, b=0, k=4-4=0

ans +=2 (ans=3)

Both a and b are 0, so don't append back.

So, final ans=3, which matches the expected output.

But in the provided code, in the second iteration, a=2, b=2, x=2, k=4 >=4

So, a=0, b=0, k=0

ans +=2 (ans=1+2=3)

Then, return ans=3

So, in this case, it works correctly.

But in the previous case, where k=5, it fails because it doesn't handle the remaining k=3 after the first iteration.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect because it doesn't handle the remaining k attacks when k < 2*x and len(nums)>=2.

I need to modify the code to handle this case.

Possible fix:

After the while loop where k >= 2*x, add another loop to handle the remaining k attacks, attacking the first and last ships alternately until k=0 or no ships are left.

Here's how it can be done:

while k and len(nums) >= 2:

a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()

x = min(a, b)

if k >= 2 * x:

a -= x

b -= x

k -= 2 * x

if a > 0:

nums.appendleft(a)

if b > 0:

nums.append(b)

else:

# Handle remaining k attacks individually

while k and len(nums) >= 2:

if k >=1:

# Attack first ship

if nums[0] > 0:

nums[0] -=1

k -=1

if nums[0] ==0:

ans +=1

nums.popleft()

if k >=1 and len(nums) >=1:

# Attack last ship

if nums[-1] >0:

nums[-1] -=1

k -=1

if nums[-1] ==0:

ans +=1

nums.pop()

break

Then, finally, handle the case when k >0 and len(nums)==1

if k and len(nums)==1 and k >= nums[0]:

ans +=1

return ans

This way, it handles batch attacks when possible and falls back to individual attacks when necessary.

This should fix the issue.

But in the provided code, it doesn't have this additional loop to handle individual attacks, so it's incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ships are sunk after a series of attacks by the Kraken. The Kraken alternately attacks the first and last ships in a sequence, reducing their durability until they sink.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a deque to manage the ships' durabilities since it allows efficient operations at both ends.
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - While there are enough attacks (`k`) and at least two ships left:
     - Calculate the minimum durability between the first and last ship.
     - Determine how many full cycles of attacks (first and last ship) can be performed.
     - Reduce the durability of the first and last ships by the minimum value and adjust `k`.
     - Remove ships if their durability drops to zero and update the sunk counter.

3. **Individual Attacks**:
   - If there are remaining attacks and at least two ships left:
     - Perform individual attacks alternately on the first and last ships until `k` is exhausted or no ships are left.

4. **Final Check**:
   - If there is one ship left and sufficient attacks remaining to sink it, increment the sunk counter.

### Solution Code

```python
from collections import deque

def count_sunk_ships(t):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        nums = deque(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
        results.append(ans)
    return results

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a = nums.popleft()
        b = nums.pop()
        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
            if a > 0:
                nums.appendleft(a)
            if b > 0:
                nums.append(b)
        else:
            break
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        if k >= 1:
            if nums[0] > 0:
                nums[0] -= 1
                k -= 1
                if nums[0] == 0:
                    ans += 1
                    nums.popleft()
            if k >= 1 and len(nums) >= 2:
                if nums[-1] > 0:
                    nums[-1] -= 1
                    k -= 1
                    if nums[-1] == 0:
                        ans += 1
                        nums.pop()
    if k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]:
        ans += 1
    return ans

# Example usage
T = int(input())
for result in count_sunk_ships(T):
    print(result)
```

### Explanation

1. **Batch Processing**:
   - We handle multiple attacks in batches by calculating how many full cycles of attacks can be performed on the first and last ships simultaneously.
   - This reduces the number of iterations needed for large values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Individual Attacks**:
   - After handling the batch attacks, if there are remaining attacks, we perform individual attacks on the first and last ships alternately.
   - This ensures that we correctly manage the sequence of attacks and the state of the ships.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - By processing attacks in batches, we minimize the computational complexity, making the solution efficient for large inputs.

This approach ensures that we accurately determine the number of ships sunk after the Kraken's attacks while maintaining efficiency.
