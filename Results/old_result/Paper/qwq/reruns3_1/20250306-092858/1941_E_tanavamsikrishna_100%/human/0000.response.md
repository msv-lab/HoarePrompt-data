Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bernard has to cross a river on a ferry, and he's always late. Rudolf wants to help by building bridges across the river to make the crossing faster. The river is represented as a grid with n rows and m columns, where each cell has a certain depth, and the depths on the first and last columns are zero because those are the banks.

Rudolf can build a bridge on any row, and to build a bridge, he needs to install supports in certain cells. The supports must be installed in the first and last columns of the row, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than d cells. The cost of installing a support in cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.

Moreover, Rudolf wants to build k bridges on consecutive rows and minimize the total cost of installing supports for all these bridges.

Given multiple test cases, I need to compute the minimum total cost for each test case.

First, I need to understand how to compute the cost for a single bridge on a single row. Then, since the bridges are on consecutive rows, I can consider sequences of k rows and sum their individual bridge costs, aiming to find the minimum sum among all possible sequences of k consecutive rows.

Let's focus on building one bridge on a single row. The row is represented as a list of depths, with the first and last being zero. I need to place supports such that:

1. Supports are placed in the first and last cells.

2. The distance between any two adjacent supports is at most d.

The cost for each support in cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.

So, for a given row, I need to find the minimum cost to place supports under these constraints.

This sounds like an optimization problem, possibly solvable with dynamic programming.

Let me think about dynamic programming for a single row.

Let's define dp[j] as the minimum cost to build a bridge up to cell j, given the constraints.

Initialization:

- dp[0] = a_{i,0} + 1 = 1 (since a_{i,0} = 0)

- dp[1] = a_{i,1} + 1 + cost from dp[0], but need to check if the distance is acceptable.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that supports can be placed in any cell between 0 and m-1, inclusive, with mandatory supports at 0 and m-1, and the distance between any two adjacent supports ≤ d.

So, the problem is to place supports at positions where the distance between any two consecutive supports is at most d, including mandatory supports at positions 0 and m-1, and minimize the total cost.

This sounds similar to the "Jump Game" variants, where you can jump up to d cells at a time, and the cost of landing on a cell is a_{i,j} + 1.

Wait, but in Jump Game, you typically minimize the number of jumps, but here, we need to minimize the sum of costs at the cells where supports are placed.

So, perhaps I can model this as a dynamic programming problem where dp[j] represents the minimum cost to place supports up to column j, including column j.

The recurrence would be:

dp[j] = min over all k from max(0, j - d) to j - 1 of (dp[k] + a_{i,j} + 1)

with the base case dp[0] = 1 (since a_{i,0} = 0, and cost is 1)

And finally, dp[m-1] will give the minimum cost for that row.

Then, for k consecutive rows, I need to select a sequence of k consecutive rows and sum their individual dp[m-1] values, then find the minimum such sum.

Given that n and m can be up to 100 and 2*10^5 respectively, and t can be up to 10^3, but with the constraint that the total sum of n*m across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient solution.

Computing dp for one row takes O(m*d), which should be acceptable since m can be up to 2*10^5 and d up to m, but with n up to 100 and k up to n, and t up to 10^3, but with the sum of n*m across all test cases being up to 2*10^5, it should be manageable.

Now, looking at the provided program:

It defines two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_2 seems to handle the input and overall logic:

- It reads n, m, k, d.

- Reads n rows of depths.

- Computes costs for each row using func_1.

- Then computes the sum of costs for every k consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum.

func_1 seems to implement the dynamic programming for a single row.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(row, d: int):

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

This seems to be implementing the dp for a single row, but using a sliding window minimum approach with a heap to optimize the dp computation.

Let's verify if this correctly computes the minimum cost for a single row.

In the dp approach, dp[j] = min over k from max(0, j - d) to j - 1 of (dp[k] + a_{i,j} + 1)

So, for each j, we need to find the minimum dp[k] for k in [j - d, j - 1], and then add a_{i,j} + 1.

A straightforward implementation would be O(m*d), which could be too slow if d is large.

To optimize, we can use a sliding window minimum approach, where we maintain a window of size d and keep track of the minimum dp[k] in that window.

Using a heap (priority queue), we can keep track of the minimum dp[k] in the current window.

However, in the provided code, it seems to be modifying the row list in place, which might not be the best approach.

Let me try to re-implement the dp approach properly.

Here's a better way to implement func_1:

def func_1(row, d):

m = len(row)

dp = [float('inf')] * m

dp[0] = 1  # since a_{i,0} = 0, cost is 1

min_heap = []

for j in range(1, m):

while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] <= j - d - 1:

heappop(min_heap)

if min_heap:

dp[j] = min_heap[0][0] + row[j] + 1

else:

dp[j] = dp[j - 1] + row[j] + 1  # or some other initialization

heappush(min_heap, (dp[j - 1], j - 1))

return dp[-1]

Wait, but in the provided code, it's modifying the row list in place, which might be confusing.

Let's see what the provided code does:

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

Wait, there's an issue here. The heap is being popped until the top element's index is greater than i - d - 1.

Wait, i - (d + 2) seems off.

Let me think about the sliding window.

The window for j is from j - d to j - 1.

So, for each j, we need to consider k from j - d to j - 1.

In the heap, we should keep elements within this window.

So, when j increases, we need to remove elements whose indices are less than j - d.

Hence, the condition should be while min_heap[0][1] <= j - d:

heappop(min_heap)

Then, dp[j] = min_heap[0][0] + a_{j} + 1

And push (dp[j - 1], j - 1) into the heap.

But in the provided code, it's using i instead of j, and the condition is while e[1] <= i - (d + 2):

Which seems incorrect.

Wait, let's map the variables:

In the provided code:

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

This seems flawed because:

- It's popping elements from the heap until it finds one with index > i - d - 1.

- But the correct condition should be to remove elements with index <= i - d.

- Also, it's modifying the row in place, which might not be correct because row[i] is being used in the calculation.

Let me try to correct this.

A better approach is to keep a dp array separately.

Here's a corrected version of func_1:

def func_1(row, d):

m = len(row)

dp = [float('inf')] * m

dp[0] = 1  # since a_{i,0} = 0, cost is 1

min_heap = []

for j in range(1, m):

# Remove elements that are out of the window

while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] <= j - d - 1:

heappop(min_heap)

# Get the minimum dp[k] for k in [j - d, j - 1]

if min_heap:

dp[j] = min_heap[0][0] + row[j] + 1

else:

dp[j] = dp[j - 1] + row[j] + 1  # or some other value

# Push the current dp[j - 1] into the heap

if j - 1 >= 0:

heappush(min_heap, (dp[j - 1], j - 1))

return dp[-1]

This seems more accurate.

Now, comparing this with the provided code, it's different.

The provided code modifies the row in place, which might not be correct because row[i] is being used in the calculation.

Moreover, the condition in the while loop seems off.

Hence, the provided program might be incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps it's optimized in some way.

Let me check with the sample input.

Sample Input:

3 11 1 4

Sample Output:

Let's see for the first test case:

n=3, m=11, k=1, d=4

Rows:

Row 1: [0,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,0]

Row 2: [0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,3,2,0]

Row 3: [0,1,2,3,5,5,5,5,5,2,0]

Since k=1, we need to choose one row and build one bridge on it, and find the row with the minimum cost.

Let's compute the cost for each row.

For Row 1:

dp[0] = 1

dp[1] = dp[0] + row[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

dp[2] = min(dp[1], dp[0]) + row[2] + 1 = min(3,1) + 2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

dp[3] = min(dp[2], dp[1], dp[0]) + row[3] + 1 = min(4,3,1) + 3 + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

dp[4] = min(dp[3], dp[2], dp[1], dp[0]) + row[4] + 1 = min(5,4,3,1) + 4 + 1 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

dp[5] = min(dp[4], dp[3], dp[2], dp[1], dp[0]) + row[5] + 1 = min(6,5,4,3,1) + 5 + 1 = 1 + 5 + 1 = 7

dp[6] = min(dp[5], dp[4], dp[3], dp[2], dp[1]) + row[6] + 1 = min(7,6,5,4,3) + 4 + 1 = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8

dp[7] = min(dp[6], dp[5], dp[4], dp[3], dp[2]) + row[7] + 1 = min(8,7,6,5,4) + 3 + 1 = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8

dp[8] = min(dp[7], dp[6], dp[5], dp[4], dp[3]) + row[8] + 1 = min(8,8,7,6,5) + 2 + 1 = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8

dp[9] = min(dp[8], dp[7], dp[6], dp[5], dp[4]) + row[9] + 1 = min(8,8,8,7,6) + 1 + 1 = 6 + 1 + 1 = 8

dp[10] = min(dp[9], dp[8], dp[7], dp[6], dp[5]) + row[10] + 1 = min(8,8,8,8,7) + 0 + 1 = 7 + 0 + 1 = 8

So, cost for Row 1 is 8.

Similarly, for Row 2:

dp[0] = 1

dp[1] = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

dp[2] = min(3,1) + 2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

dp[3] = min(4,3,1) + 3 + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

dp[4] = min(5,4,3,1) + 2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

dp[5] = min(4,5,4,3,1) + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

dp[6] = min(3,4,5,4,3) + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6

dp[7] = min(6,3,4,5,4) + 3 + 1 = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7

dp[8] = min(7,6,3,4,5) + 3 + 1 = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7

dp[9] = min(7,7,6,3,4) + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6

dp[10] = min(6,7,7,6,3) + 0 + 1 = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4

So, cost for Row 2 is 4.

For Row 3:

dp[0] = 1

dp[1] = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

dp[2] = min(3,1) + 2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

dp[3] = min(4,3,1) + 3 + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

dp[4] = min(5,4,3,1) + 5 + 1 = 1 + 5 + 1 = 7

dp[5] = min(7,5,4,3,1) + 5 + 1 = 1 + 5 + 1 = 7

dp[6] = min(7,7,5,4,3) + 5 + 1 = 3 + 5 + 1 = 9

dp[7] = min(9,7,7,5,4) + 5 + 1 = 4 + 5 + 1 = 10

dp[8] = min(10,9,7,7,5) + 5 + 1 = 5 + 5 + 1 = 11

dp[9] = min(11,10,9,7,7) + 2 + 1 = 7 + 2 + 1 = 10

dp[10] = min(10,11,10,9,7) + 0 + 1 = 7 + 0 + 1 = 8

So, cost for Row 3 is 8.

Hence, the minimum cost among the three rows is 4, which matches the first output in the sample.

Similarly, I can verify the other test cases, but for now, it seems the program might be correct.

However, I noticed that in the provided code, func_1 modifies the row in place, which might lead to incorrect results if not handled carefully.

Moreover, the condition in the while loop seems off.

Hence, I think the program might be incorrect.

Wait, but the sample input gives the correct output.

Maybe it's correct after all.

Let me think about another test case.

Consider n=1, m=3, k=1, d=1

Row: [0,1,0]

According to the problem, supports must be placed at columns 0 and 2, and the distance between them is 1, which is equal to d=1, so it's allowed.

Hence, cost should be a_{0} + 1 + a_{2} + 1 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

But according to the dp approach:

dp[0] = 1

dp[1] = dp[0] + a_{1} + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

dp[2] = min(dp[1], dp[0]) + a_{2} + 1 = min(3,1) + 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

Hence, cost is 2, which is correct.

Another test case: n=1, m=4, k=1, d=1

Row: [0,1,2,0]

Here, supports must be placed at columns 0 and 3, with distance 3, which is greater than d=1, so we need to place an additional support in between.

The possible placements are:

- Supports at 0,1,3: cost = (0+1) + (1+1) + (0+1) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

- Supports at 0,2,3: cost = (0+1) + (2+1) + (0+1) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

- Supports at 0,1,2,3: cost = 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7

Hence, the minimum cost is 4.

Let's see what the dp approach gives:

dp[0] = 1

dp[1] = dp[0] + a_{1} + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

dp[2] = min(dp[1], dp[0]) + a_{2} + 1 = min(3,1) + 2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

dp[3] = min(dp[2], dp[1], dp[0]) + a_{3} + 1 = min(4,3,1) + 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

Wait, this gives dp[3]=2, which is less than the minimum possible cost of 4.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dp approach.

Let me re-examine the dp definition.

dp[j] represents the minimum cost to build a bridge up to and including column j, with supports placed according to the rules.

Hence, dp[j] = min over k from max(0, j - d) to j - 1 of (dp[k] + a_{j} + 1), and also ensuring that supports are placed at j and at k, and the distance between any two consecutive supports is ≤ d.

In the above test case, dp[3] = min(dp[2], dp[1], dp[0]) + a_{3} + 1 = min(4,3,1) + 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

But this cost of 2 is impossible because to have a support at j=3, the previous support must be at j=2 or j=1, given d=1.

If the previous support is at j=2, then dp[2]=4, and dp[3]=4 + 0 +1=5, but that's not correct because we can have supports at 0,1,3 with cost 4.

Wait, perhaps the dp definition needs to ensure that there is a support at j, and the previous support is within d distance.

Hence, dp[j] = min over k from max(0, j - d) to j - 1 of (dp[k] + a_{j} + 1)

But in the above calculation, dp[3] = min(dp[2], dp[1], dp[0]) + a_{3} + 1 = min(4,3,1) + 0 +1 =1 +0 +1=2, which is incorrect.

This suggests that the dp approach needs to account for the fact that if we place a support at j, the previous support must be within d distance, but also, the supports must be placed in a way that all columns are covered.

The issue might be that dp[j] represents the minimum cost to cover columns up to j, with a support at j.

In that case, dp[j] = min over k from max(0, j - d) to j - 1 of (dp[k] + a_{j} + 1)

But in the above test case, dp[3] should be min(dp[2] + a_{3} +1, dp[1] + a_{3} +1), but dp[1] + a_{3} +1 = 3 + 0 +1=4, and dp[2] + a_{3} +1=4 +0 +1=5, so dp[3] should be 4, not 2.

Hence, there's an error in the dp approach.

Wait, in the dp calculation, dp[3] = min(dp[2], dp[1], dp[0]) + a_{3} +1 = min(4,3,1) +0 +1=1 +0 +1=2, but this is incorrect because dp[0] corresponds to placing a support at 0, but the distance between 0 and 3 is 3, which is greater than d=1.

Hence, dp[j] should only consider k such that j - k <= d.

In this case, k should be from j - d to j -1.

So, for j=3, k can be from 2 to 3 -1=2, so k=2 only.

Hence, dp[3] = dp[2] + a_{3} +1 =4 +0 +1=5

But in the earlier dp calculation, dp[3] was incorrectly taking dp[1] and dp[0], which are outside the window.

Hence, the dp approach needs to ensure that k is within j - d to j -1.

In the earlier code, the window was set to d, but perhaps the indices were off.

Looking back at the provided code:

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

In this code, min_heap contains (dp[k], k) for k in [j - d, j -1]

But the condition while e[1] <= i - (d + 2): seems incorrect.

It should be while min_heap[0][1] < i - d:

heappop(min_heap)

Then, dp[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] +1

And push (dp[i-1], i-1) into the heap.

Hence, the provided code seems to have an error in the condition for removing elements from the heap.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
