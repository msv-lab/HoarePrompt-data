Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I need to perform exactly K operations on it. In each operation, I can select any contiguous subarray (which could even be empty) and insert the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array. My goal is to maximize the sum of the array after K operations, and since the sum can be very large, I need to output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what exactly an operation entails. I can choose any contiguous subarray, calculate its sum, and then insert that sum into the array at any position. This means that the array can grow with each operation because I'm adding a new element (the sum) to it.

My task is to perform exactly K such operations and maximize the sum of the array afterward. Since I can choose where to insert the sum, I can potentially create new subarrays that allow me to sum positive values multiple times.

I should consider the impact of each operation on the total sum. If I select a subarray with a positive sum and insert that sum into the array, I'm effectively adding that sum to the array's total sum because I'm adding a new element equal to the sum of the subarray.

Wait a minute, but the sum of the array after inserting a new element would be the original sum plus the sum of the subarray I chose. So, if I choose a subarray with sum S and insert it into the array, the new sum becomes original_sum + S.

If I repeat this K times, choosing the same subarray each time, the total sum would be original_sum + K*S. But the problem allows me to choose any contiguous subarray each time, possibly different ones.

I need to maximize the sum, so I should choose the subarray with the maximum possible sum each time. That sounds like I should find the maximum subarray sum and add it K times to the original sum.

But wait, there's more to it. Because after each insertion, the array changes, and new subarrays become possible. For example, if I insert the sum of a subarray, that new element can be part of new subarrays in future operations.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the maximum sum I can achieve after K operations.

Suppose I have the original array with sum S. In each operation, I can select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert that sum into the array.

If I choose a subarray with sum X and insert it into the array, the new sum becomes S + X.

In the next operation, I can again choose a subarray with sum Y and insert it into the array, making the sum S + X + Y.

But I can choose Y to be the same as X or a different subarray.

Wait, but I need to maximize the sum, so I should choose the subarray with the maximum possible sum in each operation.

If I always choose the subarray with the maximum sum, say M, then after K operations, the total sum would be S + K*M.

But is this always optimal?

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example in the problem:

n=2, k=2, array: [-4, -7]

The maximum subarray sum is -4 (since both elements are negative, and -4 is greater than -7).

If I always choose this subarray and insert -4 each time, then after two operations, the sum would be (-4) + (-7) + (-4) + (-4) = -19.

But according to the example, the answer is 999,999,996, which is -11 modulo 10^9 + 7.

Wait, that's different from what I calculated. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Looking back at the example, it says that taking empty subarrays twice and inserting zero each time results in a sum of -11, which modulo 10^9 + 7 is 999,999,996.

So, in this case, inserting zeros is better than inserting negative sums.

That suggests that if the maximum subarray sum is negative, it's better to insert zeros.

Wait, but zero is not a possible sum if all subarrays have negative sums, unless I choose an empty subarray.

Ah, so I need to consider the sum of an empty subarray, which is zero.

So, if all subarrays have negative sums, I should choose the empty subarray and insert zero each time.

That way, I'm not decreasing the sum.

In the first example, choosing the empty subarray twice and inserting zero twice results in the array [-4, -7, 0, 0], with sum -11, which is better than choosing the maximum subarray sum of -4 and getting -19.

So, my previous approach is incorrect.

I need to adjust my strategy.

I should find the maximum subarray sum, and if it's positive, add it K times to the original sum.

If it's negative, add zero K times, meaning the sum remains the original sum.

But wait, in the second example:

n=3, k=3, array: [2, 2, 8]

The maximum subarray sum is 2 + 2 + 8 = 12.

If I insert 12 three times, the final sum would be 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 48.

But according to the example, it's 96.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the second example, the operations are described as:

[2, 2, 8] -> [2, 2, 8, 12] -> [2, 2, 8, 12, 24] -> [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48], with the sum being 96.

So, they are choosing the sum of the entire array each time and inserting it at the end.

Wait, but 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96, which matches the example.

So, in this case, they are choosing the entire array each time and inserting its sum.

But, in my earlier approach, I thought of choosing the maximum subarray sum each time and inserting it.

In this case, the maximum subarray sum is 12, and inserting 12 three times would give sum 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 48, which is less than 96.

So, there must be a better strategy.

It seems that by choosing the entire array each time and inserting its sum, the sum grows exponentially.

Wait, in the first operation, sum is 2 + 2 + 8 = 12, insert 12, array becomes [2, 2, 8, 12], sum is 24.

Second operation, sum is 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 = 24, insert 24, array becomes [2, 2, 8, 12, 24], sum is 48.

Third operation, sum is 2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 48, insert 48, array becomes [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48], sum is 96.

So, each time, the sum is doubling.

Wait, 12, 24, 48, 96, which is multiplying by 2 each time.

So, it's like sum = initial_sum * (2^k).

Wait, but in this case, initial_sum is 12, and 12 * (2^3 - 1) = 12 * 7 = 84, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's initial_sum * 2^k - initial_sum.

Wait, 12 * (2^3 - 1) = 12 * 7 = 84, but the actual sum is 96.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's initial_sum * 2^k.

12 * 8 = 96, which matches.

But wait, in the first operation, sum is 12, after inserting 12, sum becomes 24.

Second operation, sum is 24, insert 24, sum becomes 48.

Third operation, sum is 48, insert 48, sum becomes 96.

So, it's like sum is multiplied by 2 each time.

Hence, after K operations, sum = initial_sum * 2^k.

But in the first example, initial_sum is -11, and -11 * 2^2 = -44, but the answer is -11 modulo 10^9 + 7, which is 999,999,996.

So, perhaps choosing to insert the current sum each time leads to sum = initial_sum * 2^k.

But in the first example, inserting zero instead leads to a better sum of -11, which is better than -44.

Wait, but -11 is larger than -44, but according to the modulo operation, 999,999,996 is equivalent to -11 modulo 10^9 + 7.

So, in this case, choosing to insert zero is better than choosing to insert the current sum.

Hence, perhaps the strategy is:

- If the initial sum is positive, insert the current sum each time, leading to sum = initial_sum * (2^k - 1).

- If the initial sum is non-positive, insert zero each time, leading to sum = initial_sum.

Wait, but in the second example, sum = 12 * (2^3 - 1) = 12 * 7 = 84, but the actual sum is 96.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's sum = initial_sum * 2^k.

In the second example, initial_sum = 12, 12 * 8 = 96, which matches.

In the first example, initial_sum = -11, -11 * 4 = -44, but the answer is -11, because inserting zero is better.

Hence, perhaps the strategy is:

- If initial_sum is positive, sum = initial_sum * 2^k.

- If initial_sum is non-positive, sum = initial_sum.

But in the seventh test case, with all elements negative, sum = sum(l) * 2^k, but that would be worse than sum(l).

Wait, in the seventh test case, sum is negative, and the answer is 42, which is sum(l) modulo 10^9 + 7.

Hence, in this case, inserting zero each time is better, leading to sum = sum(l).

So, the strategy should be:

- If the maximum subarray sum is positive, sum = sum(l) + sum of maximum subarray sum multiplied by (2^k - 1).

- Else, sum = sum(l).

Wait, but in the second example, maximum subarray sum is 12, which is the sum of the entire array.

So, sum = sum(l) + 12 * (2^3 - 1) = 12 + 12 * 7 = 12 + 84 = 96, which matches.

Wait, but in the first example, maximum subarray sum is -4, which is negative.

So, sum = sum(l) + (-4) * (2^2 - 1) = -11 + (-4)*3 = -11 -12 = -23, which is worse than sum(l) = -11.

Hence, in this case, we should not add the maximum subarray sum multiplied by (2^k -1), but rather keep sum(l).

Hence, the strategy should be:

- If the maximum subarray sum is positive, sum = sum(l) + maximum_subarray_sum * (2^k -1).

- Else, sum = sum(l).

Wait, but in the second example, sum = sum(l) + maximum_subarray_sum * (2^k -1) = 12 + 12 * 7 = 96.

Which matches the example.

In the first example, maximum_subarray_sum is -4, which is negative, so sum = sum(l) = -11, which matches the example.

In the seventh test case, maximum_subarray_sum is negative, so sum = sum(l).

Which matches the output.

Hence, this seems to be the correct approach.

So, to implement this, I need to:

1. Calculate the sum of the array, sum(l).

2. Find the maximum subarray sum, maxi.

3. If maxi > 0, then sum = sum(l) + maxi * (2^k -1).

Else, sum = sum(l).

4. Finally, take sum modulo 10^9 +7.

Now, I need to make sure that I handle negative sums correctly, and that I compute 2^k modulo 10^9 +7 efficiently.

Also, since n and k can be up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to compute the maximum subarray sum, which is O(n) using Kadane's algorithm.

Wait, looking at the given code, it seems to be implementing something similar.

Let me look at the given code:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

c = 0

maxi = 0

for ele in l:

if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):

maxi = max(c, maxi)

c = 0

else:

c += ele

maxi = max(c, maxi)

maxi = max(c, maxi)

print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)

So, it's reading t test cases, then for each test case, reading n, k, and the array l.

Then, it initializes c=0 and maxi=0.

Then, it iterates through the array, updating c and maxi.

This seems like an attempt at Kadane's algorithm, but it's not standard.

In standard Kadane's algorithm, we keep track of the current maximum subarray sum ending at each position.

The standard implementation is:

max_current = max_global = l[0]

for i in range(1, n):

max_current = max(l[i], max_current + l[i])

if max_current > max_global:

max_global = max_current

return max_global

But in the given code, it's doing something different.

It's setting c=0 and maxi=0.

Then, for each element:

if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):

maxi = max(c, maxi)

c = 0

else:

c += ele

maxi = max(c, maxi)

maxi = max(c, maxi)

This seems flawed.

First, in Kadane's algorithm, we should keep track of the maximum ending at each position.

Here, it's resetting c to zero when the element is negative and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of the element.

This doesn't make sense for finding the maximum subarray sum.

In standard Kadane's, we reset c to zero whenever c + ele is less than zero, but only if c + ele is negative.

Wait, actually, in standard Kadane's, we set c = max(ele, c + ele), and keep track of the maximum c seen so far.

In this code, it's doing something different, which might not correctly compute the maximum subarray sum.

This could be a mistake.

Let me test it with the second example:

n=3, k=3, l=[2,2,8]

Initialize c=0, maxi=0

First ele=2:

2 >=0 and c=0 <= abs(2)=2 → else clause: c +=2 → c=2

maxi = max(2,0)=2

maxi=2

Second ele=2:

2 >=0 and c=2 <= abs(2)=2 → if condition is true → maxi=max(2,2)=2, c=0

else clause not executed

maxi=2

Third ele=8:

8 >=0 and c=0 <= abs(8)=8 → if condition is true → maxi=max(0,2)=2, c=0

else clause not executed

maxi=2

Final maxi=2

But the maximum subarray sum should be 12 (2+2+8=12), but it's computing maxi=2, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is flawed in computing the maximum subarray sum.

It should use the standard Kadane's algorithm to compute the maximum subarray sum.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
