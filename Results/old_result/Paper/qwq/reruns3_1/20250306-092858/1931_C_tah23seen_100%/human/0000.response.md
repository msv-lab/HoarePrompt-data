Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and then setting all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is basically the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that it can always be done, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what the operation allows me to do. I can select a subarray and set all its elements to a single value x, and I can do this at most once. After this operation (or no operation), all elements should be equal.

If I don't perform any operation, that means the array is already equal, and the cost is 0. So, I need to check if all elements are already the same. If they are, then the answer is 0.

If not, I need to perform the operation in such a way that, after setting a certain subarray to a specific value, the entire array becomes equal. I need to choose i, j, and x such that setting arr[i..j] to x makes all elements equal, and I want to minimize the cost, which is (j - i + 1).

I need to find the smallest possible cost to make the array uniform.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider that after the operation, all elements should be equal to some value, say y. So, I need to choose y such that most of the array is already y, and only a small portion needs to be set to y.

Wait, but I can only perform the operation once, and it involves setting a contiguous subarray to x. So, I need to choose x, i, and j such that, after setting arr[i..j] to x, the entire array becomes equal to x or to some other value.

Wait, but if I set arr[i..j] to x, then the elements outside this range should already be equal to x, right? Because after the operation, all elements should be equal to x.

So, the elements before i and after j should already be equal to x.

So, perhaps I need to find a value x that appears at both ends of the array, and then set the middle part to x.

Wait, but that might not always be possible. For example, if x is not present at both ends.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose to set the entire array to a particular value z. If I set the entire array to z, the cost would be n (the total number of elements). But I can perform at most one operation, which can set a subarray to x, and the rest should already be x.

Wait, no, I can choose to set a subarray to x, and the rest should be x already.

Wait, that's not quite right.

Let me try to formalize this.

After the operation, all elements should be equal to some value, say x.

So, if I set arr[i..j] to x, then the elements before i and after j should already be x.

But that might not always be possible, because x might not be present at both ends.

Alternatively, I can think of it as: I need to choose x, i, and j such that:

- arr[1..i-1] are already x

- arr[i..j] are set to x

- arr[j+1..n] are already x

So, the cost is (j - i + 1), and I need to minimize this cost.

Therefore, I need to maximize the lengths of the prefix and suffix that are already equal to x.

So, for each possible x, I can find the longest prefix that is already x, and the longest suffix that is already x, and then set the middle part to x.

The cost would be the length of the middle part.

I need to choose x such that the sum of the lengths of the prefix and suffix is maximized, so that the middle part is minimized.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation, so I need to choose x and the subarray to set to x, and the cost is the length of that subarray.

Wait, perhaps another way: I need to choose a subarray to set to x such that, after setting, all elements are x.

So, the elements outside the subarray must already be x.

Alternatively, I can choose to set the entire array to x, which would cost n, but I can try to reduce the cost by having as much of the array already be x.

So, if I can find the maximum length of a prefix and suffix that are already equal to x, then the cost would be n minus that combined length.

Wait, perhaps I need to find, for each x, the maximum length of a prefix that is equal to x and the maximum length of a suffix that is equal to x.

Then, for that x, the cost would be n - (prefix_length + suffix_length - overlap).

But I need to think carefully.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first example:

n = 6

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

I can choose x = 1, and set arr[2..5] to 1.

So, i=2, j=5, x=1

Cost is 4.

After setting, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], which is all equal to 1.

Is there a way to do it with a lower cost?

If I choose x=1 and set arr[2..4] to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,5,1].

Still, the fifth element is 5, which is not 1.

So, that doesn't make the entire array equal to 1.

Similarly, if I set arr[3..5] to 1, the array becomes [1,2,1,1,1,1].

Still, the second element is 2, which is not 1.

So, in this case, setting arr[2..5] to 1 with a cost of 4 is the minimal cost.

Is there another x that could lead to a lower cost?

Let's try x=2.

If I set arr[1..3] to 2, the array becomes [2,2,2,4,5,1].

Still not all equal.

If I set arr[1..2] to 2, it becomes [2,2,3,4,5,1].

Still not all equal.

Seems like x=1 is the best choice here.

Another example:

n=7

arr=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Already all equal, so cost 0.

Another example:

n=8

arr=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

If I choose x=8 and set arr[4..6] to 8, cost is 3.

But is there a better way?

Wait, if I set arr[4..5] to 8, the array becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], cost is 2.

Is that the minimal possible?

Is there a way to do it with cost 1?

If I set arr[4] to 8, array becomes [8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8].

Still, the fifth element is 2.

So, cost of 2 is the minimal.

Seems consistent.

Another example:

n=1

arr=[1]

Already all equal, cost 0.

n=2

arr=[1,2]

If I set arr[2] to 1, cost is 1, and array becomes [1,1].

Alternatively, set arr[1] to 2, cost is 1, array becomes [2,2].

So, minimal cost is 1.

n=3

arr=[1,2,3]

If I set arr[1..2] to 3, cost is 2, array becomes [3,3,3].

Alternatively, set arr[2..3] to 1, cost is 2, array becomes [1,1,1].

No better than cost 2.

n=7

arr=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

If I set arr[1..4] to 1, cost is 4, array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3].

Still, the last element is 3.

If I set arr[4..7] to 1, cost is 4, array becomes [4,3,2,1,1,1,1].

Still, the first three elements are not 1.

If I set arr[3..5] to 1, cost is 3, array becomes [4,3,1,1,1,1,3].

Still, the first two and the last are not 1.

If I set arr[2..6] to 1, cost is 5, array becomes [4,1,1,1,1,1,3].

Still, the first and the last are not 1.

Seems like setting arr[2..5] to 1, cost 4, array becomes [4,1,1,1,1,1,3].

Still, need to set the first and the last to 1, which would require additional operations, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, perhaps choosing x=3.

Set arr[1..4] to 3, cost is 4, array becomes [3,3,3,3,1,1,3].

Still, the fifth and sixth elements are 1, not 3.

Set arr[4..7] to 3, cost is 4, array becomes [4,3,2,3,3,3,3].

Still, the first three elements are not all 3.

Set arr[3..6] to 3, cost is 4, array becomes [4,3,3,3,3,3,3].

Still, the first two elements are not 3.

Set arr[2..7] to 3, cost is 6, array becomes [4,3,3,3,3,3,3].

Now, only the first element is 4, which is not 3.

So, I need to set arr[1] to 3, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, perhaps choosing x=1.

Set arr[4..5] to 1, cost is 2, array becomes [4,3,2,1,1,1,3].

Now, set arr[1..3] to 1, but I can only do one operation.

Wait, I think the minimal cost here is 6, as per the example.

n=9

arr=[9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3]

If I choose x=5, set arr[1..5] to 5, cost is 5, array becomes [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3].

Still, the first eight elements are 5, but the last one is 3.

So, need to set arr[9] to 5, but I can only perform one operation.

Alternatively, set arr[3..9] to 5, cost is 7, array becomes [9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5].

Now, set arr[1..2] to 5, but again, only one operation.

Seems like the minimal cost is 7, as per the example.

From these examples, it seems that the strategy is to choose x and set the subarray that is not equal to x to x, minimizing the length of that subarray.

Wait, but I need to make sure that after setting that subarray to x, the entire array is equal to x.

So, the elements outside that subarray should already be equal to x.

So, I need to choose x such that the prefix and suffix that are already x are as long as possible.

So, for each possible x, find the maximum prefix length that is equal to x and the maximum suffix length that is equal to x.

Then, the cost would be n - (prefix_length + suffix_length - overlap).

Wait, but if the prefix and suffix overlap, meaning that the prefix and suffix have some common elements in the middle, I need to handle that.

Wait, actually, if the prefix and suffix overlap, it means that the entire array is equal to x, so the cost is 0.

But in the problem, it's guaranteed that it's always possible to make the array equal, even if I don't perform any operation.

Wait, no, performing no operation is allowed only if the array is already equal.

But I can perform at most one operation.

So, I need to choose x and the subarray to set to x such that after setting, the entire array is equal to x.

I need to minimize the cost, which is the length of the subarray set to x.

So, for each possible x, I need to find the minimal subarray to set to x such that the entire array becomes x.

Wait, perhaps another way: find the largest subarray (not necessarily contiguous) where the elements are already x, and set the rest to x.

But the operation allows setting a contiguous subarray to x.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I choose x to be the value that appears in both the prefix and the suffix.

I need to find the maximum prefix length where arr[1..p] are all equal to x, and the maximum suffix length where arr[s..n] are all equal to x.

Then, the minimal subarray to set to x would be arr[p+1..s-1], and the cost would be (s-1) - (p+1) + 1 = s - p - 1.

So, for each x, I can find the maximum p where arr[1..p] == x, and the maximum s where arr[s..n] == x.

Then, the cost for x is n - (p + (n - s + 1)) = n - p - n + s - 1 = s - p - 1.

I need to choose x such that s - p - 1 is minimized.

So, I need to maximize p and minimize s.

Wait, p is the length of the prefix equal to x, and s is the length of the suffix equal to x.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize p + (n - s + 1), which is the total number of elements already equal to x in the prefix and suffix.

Then, the cost would be n - (p + (n - s + 1)) = s - p - 1.

Wait, but s - p - 1 could be negative.

Wait, no, s is the starting index of the suffix, and p is the ending index of the prefix.

Wait, I need to be careful with the indices.

Let me define:

- For each x, find the maximum p such that arr[1..p] == x

- Find the minimum s such that arr[s..n] == x

Then, the subarray to set to x would be arr[p+1..s-1], and its length is s - p - 1.

I need to choose x such that s - p - 1 is minimized.

And ensure that s > p + 1, meaning that there is a subarray to set.

If p + 1 >= s, then the cost is 0, meaning that the prefix and suffix cover the entire array.

Wait, but in practice, p + (n - s + 1) <= n, and the overlap is p + (n - s + 1) - n.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the union of prefix and suffix.

The total number of elements that are already x is p + (n - s + 1) - overlap.

But I'm getting tangled up.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program is:

t = int(input())

while t:

n = int(input())

arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

print(func_1(arr))

t -= 1

def func_1(arr):

i = 0

n = len(arr)

j = len(arr) - 1

while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:

i += 1

while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:

j -= 1

if arr[0] == arr[-1]:

return max(j - i - 1, 0)

return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)

So, it defines a function func_1 that takes the array arr.

It initializes i to 0 and j to n - 1.

Then, it has two while loops:

- The first while loop increments i as long as arr[i] == arr[i+1], meaning it finds the end of the initial run of equal elements.

- The second while loop decrements j as long as arr[j] == arr[j-1], meaning it finds the start of the final run of equal elements.

Then, it checks if arr[0] == arr[-1].

- If yes, it returns max(j - i - 1, 0)

- If not, it returns max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)

Let me see what this means.

First, it finds i such that arr[0..i] are all equal.

Similarly, it finds j such that arr[j..n-1] are all equal.

Then, if arr[0] == arr[-1], it returns max(j - i - 1, 0).

Else, it returns max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0).

Wait, in the first case, if arr[0] == arr[-1], it means that both prefix and suffix are equal to arr[0], and j - i - 1 would be the length of the subarray that needs to be set to arr[0] to make the entire array equal to arr[0].

In the second case, if arr[0] != arr[-1], it needs to choose one x, either arr[0] or arr[-1], and calculate the cost accordingly.

Wait, but in the code, it doesn't explicitly choose x; it seems to assume x is arr[0] or arr[-1], but it's not clear.

Let me test this code with the first example.

First test case:

n=6

arr=[1,2,3,4,5,1]

So, arr[0]=1, arr[-1]=1

So, arr[0] == arr[-1]

Find i:

i starts at 0.

arr[0]==arr[1]? 1==2? No.

So, i remains 0.

j starts at 5.

arr[5]==arr[4]? 1==5? No.

So, j remains 5.

So, j - i - 1 = 5 - 0 - 1 = 4.

Which matches the first example's output.

Second test case:

n=7

arr=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

arr[0]=1, arr[-1]=1

Find i:

arr[0]==arr[1], arr[1]==arr[2], ..., arr[6]==arr[6]

So, i=6

j=6

j - i -1 = 6 - 6 -1 = -1

So, max(-1,0)=0, which is correct.

Third test case:

n=8

arr=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

arr[0]=8, arr[-1]=8

Find i:

arr[0]==arr[1], arr[1]==arr[2], arr[2]==arr[3]? 8==1? No.

So, i=2

j starts at 7

arr[7]==arr[6], arr[6]==arr[5], arr[5]==arr[4]? 8==2? No.

So, j=5

j - i -1 =5 -2 -1=2, which matches the third example's output.

Fourth test case:

n=1

arr=[1]

arr[0]=1, arr[-1]=1

i=0 (since len(arr)-1=0, loop doesn't run)

j=0

j - i -1 =0-0-1=-1

max(-1,0)=0, correct.

Fifth test case:

n=2

arr=[1,2]

arr[0]=1, arr[-1]=2

arr[0] != arr[-1]

So, go to else clause.

Find i:

i=0 (arr[0]==arr[1]? 1==2? No)

j=1 (arr[1]==arr[0]? 2==1? No)

So, min(n - i -1, j) = min(2 - 0 -1,1)=min(1,1)=1

Which matches the fifth example's output.

Sixth test case:

n=3

arr=[1,2,3]

arr[0]=1, arr[-1]=3

arr[0] != arr[-1]

Find i:

i=0 (arr[0]==arr[1]? 1==2? No)

j=2 (arr[2]==arr[1]? 3==2? No)

min(n - i -1, j)=min(3-0-1,2)=min(2,2)=2

Which matches the sixth example's output.

Seventh test case:

n=7

arr=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

arr[0]=4, arr[-1]=3

arr[0] != arr[-1]

Find i:

i=0 (arr[0]==arr[1]? 4==3? No)

j=6 (arr[6]==arr[5]? 3==1? No)

min(n - i -1, j)=min(7-0-1,6)=min(6,6)=6

Which matches the seventh example's output.

Eighth test case:

n=9

arr=[9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3]

arr[0]=9, arr[-1]=3

arr[0] != arr[-1]

Find i:

i=1 (arr[0]==arr[1], arr[1]==arr[2]? 9==2? No)

j=8 (arr[8]==arr[7], arr[7]==arr[6], arr[6]==arr[5]? 3==5? No)

min(n - i -1, j)=min(9-1-1,8)=min(7,8)=7

Which matches the eighth example's output.

So, in all the examples, this code seems to produce the correct output.

Now, I need to verify if this logic is generally correct.

So, the logic is:

- If arr[0] == arr[-1], find the length of the initial run of arr[0] and the final run of arr[-1], which are equal since arr[0] == arr[-1].

- Then,
