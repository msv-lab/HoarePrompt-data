Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Anton has a permutation of size n, and he wants to find a number x using binary search. But here's the twist: the array isn't sorted, and I can only perform up to two swaps to rearrange the elements before running the binary search. The goal is to make sure that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array that contains each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. So, for example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, binary search typically requires a sorted array. But here, we're supposed to apply it to a possibly unsorted permutation, with the option to perform up to two swaps to make it work. The problem also assures me that two swaps are always sufficient, which is helpful to know.

Let me try to grasp how binary search works in this context. The binary search algorithm provided in the problem description initializes l to 1 and r to n+1. Then, it enters a loop where it calculates the midpoint m as floor((r + l)/2). If p_m <= x, it sets l = m; otherwise, it sets r = m. This continues until r - l = 1.

The key here is that after performing the binary search, p_l should be equal to x. So, I need to arrange the permutation in such a way that after this binary search process, the element at position l is exactly x.

Given that the array isn't sorted, I need to see how I can adjust it with at most two swaps to satisfy the condition.

Let me consider the example provided in the problem:

Input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

Output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

From the first test case, with n=6, x=3, and arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6], no swaps are needed because the array is already sorted, and the binary search will correctly find x=3.

In the second test case, n=6, x=5, arr=[3,1,6,5,2,4], one swap is needed: swapping indices 3 and 4 (0-based, so positions 4 and 5 in 1-based indexing), resulting in arr=[3,1,6,5,4,2]. After the binary search, p_l should be 5.

I need to generalize this approach.

First, I should understand how the binary search proceeds on the given permutation. Since the array isn't sorted, the behavior of binary search is unpredictable, but I can simulate it to see where it ends up.

Given that, my task is to perform at most two swaps to adjust the positions of elements so that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

One way to approach this is:

1. Simulate the binary search on the original array to see where it ends up.

2. If p_l equals x, then no swaps are needed.

3. If not, try to perform one or two swaps to make p_l equal to x.

But this seems a bit vague. Let's think differently.

Another approach is to consider the positions where x could be placed to satisfy the binary search condition. Since the binary search divides the array into parts based on comparisons, I need to place x in a position where the search algorithm will converge to it.

Wait, but the array is not sorted, so the binary search may not behave as expected. However, the problem allows me to perform up to two swaps to rearrange the array before running the search.

Perhaps, I can bring x to a position where the binary search will find it by swapping it with at most one other element.

Let me consider the binary search process step by step.

Initialize l = 1, r = n + 1.

Repeat:

If r - l == 1, break.

m = floor((l + r) / 2)

If p_m <= x, set l = m

Else, set r = m

Finally, check if p_l == x.

I need to ensure that after this process, p_l == x.

Let me think about how l is updated.

In each step, m is the midpoint between l and r, and depending on whether p_m <= x or not, l or r is updated.

Eventually, l will be set to a position where p_m > x, and r will be set to m.

Wait, actually, in standard binary search, l and r are adjusted based on comparisons to find the position where x would be inserted to keep the array sorted.

But in this problem, the array isn't sorted, so the behavior is different.

Let me try to simulate the binary search on an example.

Take the second test case:

n=6, x=5

arr = [3,1,6,5,2,4] (1-based indexing)

Initialize l=1, r=7

First loop:

m = floor((1+7)/2) = 4

p_m = arr[4] = 5

Since 5 <= 5, set l = 4

Check r - l = 7 - 4 = 3 > 1

Second loop:

m = floor((4+7)/2) = 5

p_m = arr[5] = 2

Since 2 <= 5, set l = 5

Check r - l = 7 - 5 = 2 > 1

Third loop:

m = floor((5+7)/2) = 6

p_m = arr[6] = 4

Since 4 <=5, set l = 6

Check r - l = 7 - 6 = 1

Loop ends.

Check p_l = arr[6] = 4, which is not equal to x=5.

So, in this case, we need to perform swaps to make p_l =5.

Looking at the output, one swap is performed: 3 4 (1-based indexing)

So, swap arr[3] and arr[4]: swap 6 and 5.

New arr: [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Now, rerun the binary search:

l=1, r=7

First loop:

m=4, p_m=6 >5, so r=4

Check r - l =4 -1=3 >1

Second loop:

m=floor((1+4)/2)=2

p_m=1 <=5, set l=2

Check r - l=4 -2=2 >1

Third loop:

m=floor((2+4)/2)=3

p_m=5 <=5, set l=3

Check r - l=4 -3=1

Loop ends.

p_l = arr[3] =5, which matches x=5.

So, one swap was sufficient.

Another test case:

n=5, x=1

arr=[3,5,4,2,1]

Run binary search:

l=1, r=6

First loop:

m=3, p_m=4 >1, set r=3

Check r - l=3 -1=2 >1

Second loop:

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_m=3 >1, set r=1

Check r - l=1 -1=0 <1

Loop ends.

p_l = arr[1] =3 !=1

Need to perform swaps.

Output shows two swaps: 2 4 and 1 5

Swap arr[2] and arr[4]: 5 and 2 => [3,2,4,5,1]

Then swap arr[1] and arr[5]: 3 and 1 => [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, run binary search on [1,2,4,5,3]:

l=1, r=6

First loop:

m=3, p_m=4 >1, set r=3

Check r - l=3 -1=2 >1

Second loop:

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_m=1 <=1, set l=1

Check r - l=3 -1=2 >1

Third loop:

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_m=1 <=1, set l=1

Check r - l=3 -1=2 >1

Wait, this seems stuck in a loop. Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, in the second loop, m=floor((1+3)/2)=1, p_m=1 <=1, set l=1

Then check r - l=3 -1=2 >1

Third loop: m=floor((1+3)/2)=1, p_m=1 <=1, set l=1

Check r - l=3 -1=2 >1

This seems like it's stuck. But according to the problem, it should terminate when r - l =1.

Wait, perhaps I need to implement the binary search correctly.

Let me carefully simulate the binary search for the adjusted array [1,2,4,5,3]:

l=1, r=6

First loop:

m=floor((1+6)/2)=3

p_m=4 >1, set r=3

Now, r=3, l=1

Check r - l=2 >1

Second loop:

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_m=1 <=1, set l=1

Now, r=3, l=1

Check r - l=2 >1

Third loop:

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_m=1 <=1, set l=1

Now, r=3, l=1

Check r - l=2 >1

It seems like it's stuck. Maybe there's a mistake in my simulation.

Looking back at the problem, the binary search stops when r - l =1, not when they are equal.

So, in this case, it would stop after the third loop with l=1, r=3, r - l=2 >1, but according to the condition, if r - l =1, stop.

Wait, the condition is: if r - l =1, end the loop.

In my simulation, r - l =2, so it continues.

Wait, perhaps I need to see what l is when the loop ends.

Actually, in the third loop, r - l=2 >1, so it continues, but perhaps in the next loop, m=floor((1+3)/2)=1, p_m=1 <=1, set l=1, then r - l=3 -1=2 >1.

This seems like it will continue indefinitely.

Hmm, maybe there's an error in my understanding of the binary search algorithm as provided in the problem.

Looking back at the problem, the binary search is:

1. If r - l =1, end the loop

2. m = floor((r + l)/2)

3. If p_m <= x, assign l = m, otherwise r = m

After the loop ends, p_l should be equal to x.

In my simulation, l=1, r=3, r - l=2 >1, so it continues, but it seems like it's stuck in an infinite loop.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the loop condition.

Let me try to write down the steps more carefully.

Initialize l=1, r=6

Loop:

m=floor((1+6)/2)=3

p_m=4 >1, so r=3

Now, l=1, r=3, r - l=2 >1

Loop:

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_m=1 <=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=3, r - l=2 >1

Loop:

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_m=1 <=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=3, r - l=2 >1

Loop:

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_m=1 <=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=3, r - l=2 >1

...

It seems like it will continue forever.

Wait, perhaps I need to implement it correctly.

Looking back at the problem, the loop condition is: if r - l =1, end the loop

Otherwise, compute m, update l or r based on p_m <=x, and repeat.

In my simulation, r - l remains 2, so it continues forever.

This suggests that for the array [1,2,4,5,3], with x=1, the binary search doesn't terminate as expected.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Perhaps I need to implement the binary search correctly in code to see where it ends.

But for now, I need to find a way to make sure that after at most two swaps, the binary search converges to p_l =x.

Let me consider a different strategy.

Since the problem states that two swaps are always sufficient, I can look for the minimal number of swaps needed to make the binary search find x.

First, I can simulate the binary search on the original array. If it finds x, then no swaps are needed.

If not, I can try to perform one swap to make p_l =x.

If one swap isn't enough, then perform a second swap to adjust.

But this seems vague. Let's think more concretely.

Let's consider the final position l where the binary search ends.

If p_l !=x, I can swap p_l with x's current position.

But perhaps x isn't in the array, which isn't possible since it's a permutation from 1 to n, and x is between 1 and n, so x is always in the array.

Wait, no, x can be any number from 1 to n, and the permutation contains each number from 1 to n exactly once, so x is always in the permutation.

So, x is always present in the permutation.

Given that, I can find the current position of x in the permutation.

Then, I can see where the binary search ends, and if p_l !=x, swap p_l with x's current position.

If that's not sufficient, perform a second swap to adjust another element.

But maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_3()

def func_1():

return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():

return list(func_1())

def func_3():

(n, k) = func_1()

arr = func_2()

pos = -1

for i in range(n):

if arr[i] == k:

pos = i

(low, high) = (0, n)

st = set()

while low + 1 < high:

mid = (low + high) // 2

st.add(mid)

if arr[mid] > k:

high = mid

else:

low = mid

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low + 1, pos + 1)

So, in func_3(), it reads n and k, then reads the array arr.

It finds the position pos of k in arr.

Then, it sets low=0 and high=n.

It enters a loop while low +1 < high:

mid = floor((low + high)/2)

if arr[mid] > k:

high = mid

else:

low = mid

After the loop, it checks if arr[low] == k.

If yes, print 0 (meaning no swaps are needed).

Else, print 1 and then the indices (low+1 and pos+1).

Wait, in the second test case, it performed one swap: 3 4.

But according to this code, it should print 1 followed by low+1 and pos+1.

In the second test case, n=6, k=5, arr=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

pos=3 (since arr[3]=5)

Simulate the binary search:

low=0, high=6

First loop:

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=5 <=5, so low=3

Now, low=3, high=6

Check low +1 < high: 4 <6, so True

Second loop:

mid=(3+6)//2=4

arr[4]=2 <=5, so low=4

Now, low=4, high=6

Check low +1 < high:5 <6, True

Third loop:

mid=(4+6)//2=5

arr[5]=4 <=5, so low=5

Now, low=5, high=6

Check low +1 < high:6 <6, False

Loop ends.

Check arr[5]=4 !=5, so print 1 followed by low+1=6 and pos+1=4

But in the sample output, it's 3 4, which are 1-based indices for 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code or in my understanding.

Wait, in the sample output for the second test case, it's 1

3 4

But according to the code, it would print 1 followed by 6 and 4 (0-based indices, converted to 1-based).

Wait, no, in the code, pos=3, low=5 for n=6, k=5, arr=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

So, pos+1=4, low+1=6

But in the sample output, it's 3 4, which are positions 3 and 4 in 1-based indexing.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the code is using 0-based indexing for arr, but printing 1-based indices.

In Python, lists are 0-based.

So, pos=3 (0-based), which is 4 in 1-based.

low=5 (0-based), which is 6 in 1-based.

But in the sample output, it's 3 4, which are 1-based indices.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, in the second test case, the sample output is 1

3 4

But according to the code, it would print 1

4 6

But in the sample, it's 3 4.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices.

Wait, in the code, pos is the 0-based index of k in arr.

low is the 0-based index where the binary search ends.

Then, it prints low+1 and pos+1.

But in the sample output, it's printing 3 4, which are 1-based indices of 2 and 3 in 0-based.

Wait, in the second test case, pos=3 (arr[3]=5), low=5 (arr[5]=4)

So, it should print 1

6 4

But in the sample output, it's 1

3 4

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, maybe the intention is to swap arr[low] with arr[pos], but in 1-based indexing.

Wait, in 1-based indexing, pos=4, low=6, so swap 6 and 4, which is arr[5] and arr[3] in 0-based.

But in the sample output, it's swapping 3 and 4, which are arr[2] and arr[3] in 0-based.

So, the code seems to be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the logic is flawed.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the idea is to bring x to the position where the binary search ends, by swapping it with the element at that position.

So, swap arr[low] with arr[pos], where pos is the current position of x.

Then, after the swap, check if p_l ==x.

If yes, then one swap is sufficient.

If not, perform a second swap.

But in the second test case, swapping arr[low] with arr[pos] doesn't seem to work, as per the sample output.

Wait, in the second test case, n=6, k=5, arr=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

pos=3 (arr[3]=5)

Perform binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=3, arr[3]=5 <=5, low=3

mid=4, arr[4]=2 <=5, low=4

mid=5, arr[5]=4 <=5, low=5

Now, arr[5]=4 !=5, so perform one swap: swap arr[5] with arr[3]

arr becomes [3,1,6,4,2,5]

Now, rerun the binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=3, arr[3]=4 <=5, low=3

mid=4, arr[4]=2 <=5, low=4

mid=5, arr[5]=5 <=5, low=5

Now, arr[5]=5 ==5, so it's correct.

But in the sample output, it's swapping 3 and 4, which are positions 2 and 3 in 0-based indexing.

Wait, in the sample output, it's 1

3 4

Which corresponds to swapping arr[2] and arr[3]: 6 and 5.

After swapping, arr becomes [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Then, binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=3, arr[3]=6 >5, high=3

mid=1, arr[1]=1 <=5, low=1

mid=2, arr[2]=5 <=5, low=2

Now, arr[2]=5 ==5, which is correct.

So, in this case, swapping arr[2] and arr[3] achieves the goal.

But according to the code, it would swap arr[5] and arr[3], resulting in [3,1,6,4,2,5], which also works.

So, both approaches seem to work in this case.

Perhaps there are multiple possible solutions, and the problem allows any solution with up to two swaps.

Given that, maybe the code's approach is acceptable, even if it's not matching the sample output, as long as it achieves the goal with at most two swaps.

But I need to verify if the code always works.

Let's consider another test case.

Take the third test case:

n=5, x=1, arr=[3,5,4,2,1]

Find pos=4 (0-based, arr[4]=1)

Perform binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=4 >1, high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=5 >1, high=1

Now, low=0, high=1, r - l =1, loop ends.

p_l = arr[0]=3 !=1

So, need to perform swaps.

According to the code, it would perform one swap: swap arr[low] with arr[pos], i.e., swap arr[0] and arr[4]: swap 3 and 1.

New arr: [1,5,4,2,3]

Rerun binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=4 >1, high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=5 >1, high=1

mid=0, arr[0]=1 <=1, low=0

Now, check arr[0]=1 ==1, which is correct.

So, one swap suffices.

But in the sample output, it's performing two swaps:

2

2 4

1 5

Which corresponds to:

Swap arr[1] and arr[3]: 5 and 2 => [3,2,4,5,1]

Then swap arr[0] and arr[4]: 3 and 1 => [1,2,4,5,3]

After these swaps, as I simulated earlier, the binary search gets stuck in an infinite loop, or at least doesn't terminate as expected.

Wait, perhaps in this case, two swaps are necessary because one swap isn't enough.

Wait, in the earlier simulation, one swap was sufficient, but the sample output shows two swaps.

Maybe there are multiple possible solutions, and the problem allows any valid sequence of up to two swaps.

Given that, the code's approach of performing one swap might be sufficient in some cases, but not in all.

Wait, in the fourth test case:

n=6, x=3, arr=[4,3,1,5,
