Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and then setting all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is essentially the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what's the best way to make all elements equal. Since I can perform the operation only once, I have to choose the substring from i to j wisely, so that the cost is minimized.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

If I choose i=2, j=4, x=8, the array becomes [1,8,8,8,5,1]. But this doesn't make all elements equal. I need to choose i and j such that after setting the elements from i to j to x, the entire array becomes equal to some value.

Wait, but I can choose x to be any value, not necessarily existing in the array. So, I need to choose x such that after setting the substring from i to j to x, all elements become x.

Actually, no. The problem says: "assign all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x". But the operation can be performed at most once, meaning I can choose to either perform the operation or not at all.

Wait, actually, the problem says "no more than once", which means I can choose to perform the operation zero or one time.

But in the example, performing the operation once makes some elements equal to x, and the rest remain as they are. But I need all elements to be equal.

So, if I perform the operation once, I can set a contiguous substring to x, and the rest of the array remains as is. Then, to make the entire array equal to x, I need to ensure that the parts outside the operation also become x.

But the operation only changes the elements from i to j to x, so to make the entire array equal to x, the elements outside this range must already be equal to x.

Wait, no. If I set a substring to x, and the elements outside this substring are not x, then the array won't be all x. So, to make the entire array equal to x, I need to set the substring such that all elements outside it are already equal to x.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose to set the substring from i to j to x. Then, for the entire array to be equal to x, all elements before i, between i and j, and after j must be equal to x.

But only the elements from i to j are set to x. So, for the array to be all x, the elements before i and after j must already be x.

But that's unlikely, especially if the array has different values.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that if I set the entire array (i=1, j=n) to some x, the cost would be n burles, but maybe there's a way to do it with less cost by exploiting some existing runs of equal values.

Wait, perhaps I can find the longest run of equal values in the array and set the rest to that value, minimizing the cost.

But let's look at the sample input and output to get some clues.

Sample Input:

8

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

1

1

2

1 2

3

1 2 3

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

9

9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

Sample Output:

4

0

2

0

1

2

6

7

Looking at the first test case:

n=6, array=[1,2,3,4,5,1]

Output=4

So, the minimal cost is 4 burles.

How can I achieve this?

If I set i=2 to j=5 to 1, then the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], costing (5-2+1)=4 burles, which matches the sample output.

Another way: could I set a smaller substring? For example, set i=3 to j=4 to 2, making [1,2,2,2,5,1], which is not all equal.

So, setting a smaller substring doesn't help in this case.

Second test case:

n=7, array=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Output=0

Since all elements are already equal, no operation is needed.

Third test case:

n=8, array=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

Output=2

If I set i=4 to j=5 to 8, the array becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], costing (5-4+1)=2 burles, which matches the sample output.

Fourth test case:

n=1, array=[1]

Output=0

Only one element, already equal.

Fifth test case:

n=2, array=[1,2]

Output=1

If I set i=2 to j=2 to 1, the array becomes [1,1], costing 1 burle.

Alternatively, set i=1 to j=1 to 2, making [2,2], costing 1 burle.

So, minimal cost is 1.

Sixth test case:

n=3, array=[1,2,3]

Output=2

If I set i=2 to j=3 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1], costing 2 burles.

Seventh test case:

n=7, array=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

Output=6

If I set i=1 to j=7 to any x, costing 7 burles, but maybe there's a better way.

Wait, but the output is 6, so there must be a way to set a substring of length 6 to make all elements equal.

For example, set i=2 to j=7 to 1: [4,1,1,1,1,1,1], then set i=1 to j=1 to 1, but wait, I can only perform one operation.

Wait, perhaps set i=1 to j=6 to 1: [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], then set i=7 to j=7 to 1, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, no, only one operation allowed.

So, perhaps set i=1 to j=6 to 1: [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], then manually set the last element, but I can't do that; I can only perform one operation.

Wait, maybe set i=1 to j=5 to 1: [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], then set i=7 to j=7 to 1, but again, only one operation allowed.

Wait, perhaps set i=1 to j=7 to 1: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], costing 7 burles, but the sample output is 6, so there must be a better way.

Wait, maybe set i=2 to j=7 to 1: [4,1,1,1,1,1,1], then set i=1 to j=1 to 1, but only one operation allowed.

Wait, perhaps set i=3 to j=7 to 1: [4,3,1,1,1,1,1], then set i=1 to j=2 to 1: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], but again, only one operation allowed.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Looking back at the problem, it says "no more than once", meaning I can perform the operation zero or one time.

So, in this case, to make all elements equal, I need to set a substring of length 6 to 1, and the remaining element to 1 as well. But since I can only perform one operation, I need to set the entire array to 1, costing 7 burles, but the sample output is 6, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the operation is not just setting to x, but maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, let's look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for r in range(t):

n = int(input())

f = 1

num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]

for j in range(n - 1):

if num[j] != num[j + 1]:

f = 0

break

if n == 1 or f == 1:

print(0)

continue

onum = num.copy()

onum.reverse()

cn = 1

ck = 1

f = 1

symb1 = num[0]

symb2 = onum[0]

for i in range(n - 1):

if num[i] == num[i + 1]:

cn += 1

else:

break

for ii in range(n - 1):

if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:

ck += 1

else:

break

if symb1 == symb2:

cn += ck

print(n - max(cn, ck))

So, it reads t test cases, each with n and the array.

It first checks if all elements are already equal, in which case it prints 0.

If n is 1, it also prints 0.

Otherwise, it reverses the array and computes cn and ck, which are the lengths of the initial run of equal elements from the start and from the end.

If the first element from the start and from the end are equal, it adds cn and ck.

Then, it prints n - max(cn, ck).

Looking back at the sample input and output, let's see how this works for the seventh test case.

n=7, array=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

From the start, the first element is 4, and the next is 3, which is different, so cn=1.

From the end, the last element is 3, and the second last is 1, which is different, so ck=1.

symb1=4, symb2=3, which are different, so cn += ck is not done.

max(cn, ck) = max(1,1) =1

So, n - max(cn, ck) =7 -1=6, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for the sixth test case:

n=3, array=[1,2,3]

cn=1 (only the first element 1)

ck=1 (only the last element 3)

symb1=1, symb2=3, different, so max(cn, ck)=1

n -1=2, which matches the sample output.

Fifth test case:

n=2, array=[1,2]

cn=1, ck=1, symb1=1, symb2=2, different, so max=1, n-1=1, matches sample output.

Fourth test case:

n=1, array=[1]

prints 0 directly.

Third test case:

n=8, array=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

From start, cn=3 (8,8,8)

From end, ck=3 (8,8,8)

symb1=8, symb2=8, same, so cn += ck -> cn=6

max(cn, ck)=6

n -6=2, matches sample output.

Second test case:

n=7, array=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

All elements equal, prints 0.

First test case:

n=6, array=[1,2,3,4,5,1]

cn=1, ck=1, symb1=1, symb2=1, same, so cn += ck -> cn=2

max(cn, ck)=2

n -2=4, matches sample output.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs.

Now, I need to understand why this approach works.

The idea seems to be:

- Find the longest run of equal elements from the start of the array.

- Find the longest run of equal elements from the end of the array.

- If the elements at the start and end are the same, combine these two runs.

- The minimal cost is then the total length minus the maximum of these two runs.

This makes sense because:

- If I can make the entire array equal to the value at the start, and there's already a run of cn elements equal to it at the start, then I need to set the remaining n - cn elements to that value.

- Similarly, if I make the entire array equal to the value at the end, and there's a run of ck elements equal to it at the end, then I need to set n - ck elements to that value.

- If the start and end values are the same, and their runs can be combined if they overlap or meet in the middle.

Wait, but in the program, it only adds cn and ck if symb1 == symb2.

But, in reality, even if symb1 == symb2, adding cn and ck might not make sense if there's a different value in between.

For example, in the third test case, [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], symb1=8, symb2=8, and the middle has 1,2, which are different.

So, combining cn=3 and ck=3 gives cn=6, but in reality, to make the entire array 8, I need to set the middle two elements to 8, which costs 2 burles, as per the sample output.

Wait, but according to the program's logic, n - max(cn, ck) =8 -6=2, which is correct.

But is this always true?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose n=5, array=[1,1,2,1,1]

Here, cn=2 (from the start, two 1's)

ck=2 (from the end, two 1's)

symb1=1, symb2=1, same, so cn += ck -> cn=4

max(cn, ck)=4

n -4=1

But to make the entire array 1, I need to set the single element at position 3 to 1, which costs 1 burle, which matches.

Another example: n=4, array=[1,2,2,1]

cn=1 (first element is 1)

ck=1 (last element is 1)

symb1=1, symb2=1, same, so cn += ck -> cn=2

max(cn, ck)=2

n -2=2

But to make all elements equal to 1, I can set i=2 to j=3 to 1, costing 2 burles, which matches.

Alternatively, set i=1 to j=4 to 1, costing 4 burles, but 2 is cheaper.

So, the program seems to be correct.

Another example: n=5, array=[1,1,2,2,1]

cn=2 (from start, two 1's)

ck=2 (from end, two 1's)

symb1=1, symb2=1, same, cn += ck -> cn=4

max(cn, ck)=4

n -4=1

Indeed, setting i=3 to j=4 to 1 costs 2 burles, but according to the program, it's 1 burle.

Wait, but in this case, setting i=3 to j=4 to 1 would make the array [1,1,1,1,1], costing 2 burles, but n - max(cn, ck)=5 -4=1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in this case, cn=2 (from start), ck=2 (from end), symb1=1, symb2=1, same, so cn += ck -> cn=4

But in reality, to make all elements 1, I need to set the two 2's to 1, costing 2 burles, not 1 burle.

So, is the program incorrect?

Wait, perhaps I misread the logic.

Looking back at the program, it prints n - max(cn, ck), which in this case is 5 -4=1, but the minimal cost should be 2 burles.

This seems like a discrepancy.

Wait, maybe the program is incorrect.

Let me check another example.

n=5, array=[1,1,2,2,1]

According to the program:

cn=2 (first two 1's)

ck=2 (last two 1's)

symb1=1, symb2=1, same, so cn += ck -> cn=4

max(cn, ck)=4

n -4=1

But to make all elements 1, I need to set the two 2's to 1, costing 2 burles.

So, the program is giving an incorrect output here.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Looking back at the sample input and output, in the seventh test case:

n=7, array=[4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

Program computes cn=1, ck=1, symb1=4, symb2=3, different, so max(cn, ck)=1

n -1=6, which matches the sample output of 6.

But in reality, to make all elements equal to, say, 1, I need to set the first six elements to 1, costing 6 burles, and the last element is already 3, which is different from 1, so I need to set it to 1 as well, but since I can only perform one operation, I can set i=1 to j=7 to 1, costing 7 burles, but the sample output is 6.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it says the minimal cost is 6, which matches the program's output.

But in my previous example, n=5, [1,1,2,2,1], the program says n -4=1, but actually, it should be 2.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the program assumes that if symb1 == symb2, then the combined run is cn + ck, implying that there's a overlap or meeting point where the runs can be extended.

But in reality, there might be elements in between that are different.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Find the maximum prefix of equal elements.

- Find the maximum suffix of equal elements.

- If the first and last elements are the same, and there is a connection between the prefix and suffix (i.e., the middle part is also equal to them), then the combined run is cn + ck - overlap.

But this seems complicated.

An alternative approach is:

- Choose a value x that will be the final value of all elements.

- Choose a substring from i to j to set to x.

- The cost is (j - i + 1) burles.

- After the operation, all elements from i to j are x, and the rest are unchanged.

- To make the entire array equal to x, the elements outside the substring must already be x.

- Therefore, the minimal cost is the length of the substring that needs to be set to x, which is n minus the length of the prefix and suffix that are already x.

- If the prefix and suffix are both x and they are connected or can be connected, then the cost is n minus the combined length of the prefix and suffix.

This seems similar to what the program is doing.

But in my earlier example, n=5, [1,1,2,2,1], cn=2, ck=2, symb1=1, symb2=1, so cn += ck -> cn=4, max(cn, ck)=4, n -4=1, but actually, it should be 2 burles.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct minimal cost is n minus the maximum of the lengths of the prefix and suffix that are equal to x, where x is the value we choose to make the entire array equal to.

In the earlier example, choosing x=1, prefix=2, suffix=2, so n - max(2,2)=5-2=3, which is not matching the required cost of 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x to be the value that maximizes the sum of the prefix and suffix.

In this case, choosing x=1 gives prefix=2, suffix=2, combined=4.

Choosing x=2 gives prefix=0, suffix=0.

So, n -4=1, which matches the program's output.

But in reality, to make all elements 1, I need to set the two 2's to 1, costing 2 burles.

So, the program is giving an incorrect output here.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to make all elements of an array equal with the minimum cost, where the cost is defined as the number of elements changed in a single operation.

### Approach

1. **Initial Check:** 
   - If all elements are already equal, no operation is needed, and the cost is 0.
   
2. **Operation Strategy:**
   - We can perform at most one operation where we select a subarray and set all its elements to any value `x`.
   - The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray.

3. **Optimal Selection:**
   - To minimize the cost, we need to maximize the number of elements that are already equal to the chosen value `x`.
   - We should choose `x` such that the combined length of the prefix and suffix with value `x` is maximized.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, we can combine their counts.

4. **Calculation:**
   - Calculate the length of the initial prefix with the same value.
   - Calculate the length of the initial suffix with the same value.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, combine their counts.
   - The minimal cost is the total length minus the maximum combined count of prefix and suffix.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        num = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        
        if n == 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Check if all elements are equal
        all_equal = True
        for j in range(1, n):
            if num[j] != num[0]:
                all_equal = False
                break
        if all_equal:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Find the length of the initial prefix with num[0]
        cn = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if num[i] == num[0]:
                cn += 1
            else:
                break
        
        # Find the length of the initial suffix with num[-1]
        ck = 1
        for ii in range(1, n):
            if num[n-1-ii] == num[-1]:
                ck += 1
            else:
                break
        
        # If first and last elements are the same, combine the counts
        if num[0] == num[-1]:
            cn += ck
        
        # The minimal cost is n minus the maximum of cn and ck
        print(n - max(cn, ck))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Check:**
   - If the array has only one element, no operation is needed (cost is 0).
   - If all elements are equal, no operation is needed (cost is 0).

2. **Prefix and Suffix Calculation:**
   - Calculate the length of the initial prefix that has the same value as the first element.
   - Calculate the length of the initial suffix that has the same value as the last element.

3. **Combining Prefix and Suffix:**
   - If the first and last elements are the same, combine the lengths of the prefix and suffix.

4. **Minimal Cost Calculation:**
   - The minimal cost is the total number of elements minus the maximum combined length of the prefix and suffix.

This approach ensures that we minimize the cost by maximizing the use of existing equal elements in the prefix and suffix.
