Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase letters such that there are exactly n special characters in this string. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

First, I need to understand what makes a character special. Let's look at the example provided: in the string "AAABAACC", there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's verify that:

- Position 1: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'A' (right). It's equal to both, so it shouldn't be special. Wait, but the example says it's special. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the first character only has one neighbor, the right one. So, if the first character is equal to its only neighbor, it's special. Similarly, the last character only has one neighbor, the left one. So, if it's equal to that, it's special.

Let's check "AAABAACC" again:

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' (right neighbor), so it's special.

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' (right), so not special.

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right), so it's special because it's equal to one neighbor.

- Pos 4: 'B' != 'A' (left) and 'A' (right), so not special.

- Pos 5: 'A' != 'B' (left) and 'A' (right), so it's special because it's equal to one neighbor.

- Pos 6: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'C' (right), so it's special.

- Pos 7: 'C' != 'A' (left) and 'C' (right), so it's special.

- Pos 8: 'C' == 'C' (left), so it's special.

Okay, that matches the example. So, edge cases are the first and last characters, which only have one neighbor.

Now, I need to build a string with exactly n such special characters. The string should be up to 200 characters long, and I need to output "YES" followed by the string if it's possible, or "NO" if it's not.

Looking at the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

if n % 2:

print('NO')

else:

s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)

if len(s) < 200:

print('YES')

print(s)

else:

print('NO')

So, it checks if n is odd, and if so, prints 'NO'. If n is even, it creates a string by repeating 'AAB' n//2 times. Then, if the length of this string is less than 200, it prints 'YES' and the string; otherwise, 'NO'.

First, I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let's consider n=6, as in the example.

s = 'AAB' * 3 = 'AABAAB'

Now, let's check the number of special characters in 'AABAAB':

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' (right) → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → not special

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → special

- Pos 4: 'B' != 'A' (left) and 'A' (right) → special

- Pos 5: 'A' != 'B' (left) and 'A' (right) → special

- Pos 6: 'A' == 'A' (left) → special

So, positions 1,3,4,5,6 are special → that's 5 special characters, but n=6. Wait, that's not matching. The example has 6 special characters, but 'AABAAB' has 5. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I miscounted:

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → not special

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → special

- Pos 4: 'B' != 'A' (left) and 'A' (right) → special

- Pos 5: 'A' != 'B' (left) and 'A' (right) → special

- Pos 6: 'A' == 'A' (left) → special

Wait, that's 1,3,4,5,6 → 5 special characters. But n=6, which doesn't match. So, perhaps this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, maybe the string needs to be constructed differently.

Let me think about how to approach this problem.

First, observe that in a string, special characters are those that are equal to exactly one neighbor.

So, for any character, if it's equal to its left neighbor but not the right, or equal to the right neighbor but not the left, it's special.

Also, for the first and last characters, they only have one neighbor, so they are special if they are equal to that single neighbor.

I need to construct a string where the total number of such characters is exactly n.

Let me try to find a pattern or a way to control the number of special characters.

One way to have a special character is to have a single character between two different characters. For example, in "ABA", position 2 ('B') is special because it's different from both neighbors, but in this problem, special means equal to exactly one neighbor.

Wait, in "ABA", position 1: 'A' == 'B' (right)? No, 'A' != 'B', so not special. Position 2: 'B' != 'A' (left) and 'A' (right), so not special. Position 3: 'A' == 'B' (left), but 'B' is not equal to 'A', so wait, how does that work?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a sequence like "AAB", positions are:

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' (right) → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → not special

- Pos 3: 'B' != 'A' (left) → special

So, in "AAB", there are two special characters.

Similarly, "AABAAB" should have:

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' → not special

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'B' → special

- Pos 4: 'B' != 'A' and 'A' → not special

- Pos 5: 'A' != 'B' and 'A' → special

- Pos 6: 'A' == 'A' → special

Wait, that's positions 1,3,5,6 → 4 special characters. But earlier I thought it was 5. Maybe I miscounted.

Wait, pos 4: 'B' != 'A' (left) and 'A' (right) → should it be special? Wait, the character 'B' is not equal to 'A' on the left and 'A' on the right, so it's equal to neither neighbor, so it's not special.

So, in "AAB", there are 2 special characters.

In "AABAAB", there are 4 special characters.

So, for n=6, the example has 6 special characters, but "AABAAB" has 4. So, perhaps repeating 'AAB' isn't sufficient.

Let me try to find another pattern.

Suppose I use "AAB" which has 2 special characters.

So, for n=6, I need 6 special characters. If 'AAB' has 2, then 'AAB AAB AAB' would have 2*3=6 special characters.

Wait, but in "AABAABAAB", let's see:

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' → not special

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'B' → special

- Pos 4: 'B' != 'A' and 'A' → not special

- Pos 5: 'A' != 'B' and 'A' → special

- Pos 6: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 7: 'A' == 'B' → special

- Pos 8: 'B' != 'A' and 'A' → not special

- Pos 9: 'A' == 'B' → special

Wait, positions 1,3,5,6,7,9 are special → that's 6 special characters. Perfect for n=6.

So, "AABAABAAB" has 6 special characters.

Similarly, for n=4, "AABAAB" has 4 special characters.

For n=2, "AAB" has 2 special characters.

For n=0, I can use "ABC" which has 0 special characters.

Wait, but n is at least 1, so n=0 is not relevant here.

But according to the program, if n is odd, it prints 'NO', else it prints 'YES' and 'AAB' repeated n//2 times.

But in the example, for n=1, it should be 'NO', which matches the program.

For n=2, it prints 'YES' and 'AAB'.

Wait, but 'AAB' has 2 special characters, which is correct.

For n=6, it prints 'AAB' repeated 3 times, which is "AABAABAAB", having 6 special characters.

So, seems correct for even n.

But is there a case where n is even, but the string length exceeds 200?

Well, 'AAB' has 3 characters, so for n//2 repeats, length is 3*(n//2).

For n=50, which is the maximum n, n//2=25, so length=75, which is less than 200.

So, length should never exceed 200 for n<=50.

Therefore, the program seems correct.

But wait, in the program, it has:

if len(s) < 200:

print('YES')

print(s)

else:

print('NO')

But for n<=50, s.length=3*(n//2)<=3*25=75<200, so it should always print 'YES' and the string for even n, and 'NO' for odd n.

Which seems correct based on the example.

But in the example, for n=1, it's 'NO', for n=6, it's 'YES AAABAACC', and for n=2, it's 'YES MM'.

Wait, but according to the program, for n=2, it should print 'YES AAB', but the example shows 'YES MM'.

Wait, 'MM' has only one special character: the first 'M' is special because it's equal to the second 'M', and the second 'M' is special because it's equal to the first 'M'. So, both are special.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says for n=2, 'YES MM', which has 2 special characters.

But according to the program, it would print 'YES AAB', which has 2 special characters.

So, both are correct.

But in the example for n=6, it shows 'AAABAACC' with 6 special characters, but the program generates 'AABAABAAB' for n=6, which also has 6 special characters.

So, different strings, but both are correct.

Hence, the program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that it contains exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Special Characters**:
   - A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - For the first and last characters in the string, they only have one neighbor, so they are special if they are equal to that neighbor.
   - For characters in the middle, they are special if they are equal to one neighbor but not the other.

2. **Pattern Identification**:
   - We observe that the substring 'AAB' contributes exactly two special characters.
   - By repeating 'AAB' multiple times, we can control the number of special characters.

3. **Construction of the String**:
   - For even values of n, we can construct a string by repeating 'AAB' (which has 2 special characters) n//2 times.
   - For odd values of n, it is impossible to construct such a string because 'AAB' always adds two special characters, and no combination can result in an odd number of special characters.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If n is 0, any string where no character is equal to its neighbors would work, but since n is at least 1, this case is not considered.
   - For n=1, it is impossible, hence 'NO'.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) <= 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases t.
  - For each test case, read the integer n.

- **Logic**:
  - If n is odd, print 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters with the given pattern.
  - If n is even, construct the string by repeating 'AAB' n//2 times.
  - Check if the length of the constructed string is within the limit (less than 200 characters). If yes, print 'YES' followed by the string; otherwise, print 'NO'.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The approach is efficient as it constructs the string in linear time relative to the number of repetitions needed.
  - Given that n is at most 50, and each 'AAB' is 3 characters, the maximum string length is 150 characters, which is well within the 200-character limit.

This solution ensures that we always produce a correct string for even n and correctly identify impossibility for odd n.
