Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. We have n signs of the apocalypse, each occurring every a_i years. These signs must occur sequentially, meaning each sign must happen one after the other in the order specified. So, the first sign occurs at year a_1, then the second sign must occur after that, and so on, up to the nth sign.

First, I need to figure out in which year the nth sign will occur, given that each sign must happen strictly after the previous one.

Let's look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 6

a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]

The explanation says:

- Wait for the first sign in the 3rd year.

- Wait for the second sign in the 4th year (since year 2 has already passed).

- Wait for the third sign in the 8th year (since the second sign happened in the 4th year).

- Wait for the fourth sign in the 10th year (year 5 has already passed).

- Wait for the fifth sign in the 18th year (year 9 has already passed).

- Wait for the sixth sign in the 36th year.

So, the final answer is 36.

From this, it seems like for each sign, we need to find the next occurrence that is strictly after the previous sign's occurrence.

Let me try to generalize this.

Let's say we have signs with periods a1, a2, ..., an.

We need to find the smallest year y such that for each sign i from 1 to n, there exists an occurrence of the i-th sign in year y, and this occurrence is strictly after the occurrence of the (i-1)-th sign.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's more precise to say that after the (i-1)-th sign occurs, we start waiting for the i-th sign in the next year.

So, perhaps it's better to think of it iteratively.

Start with year 0.

For the first sign, find the smallest year that is a multiple of a1 and greater than 0.

That would be a1.

Then, for the second sign, find the smallest year that is a multiple of a2 and greater than a1.

Similarly, for the third sign, find the smallest year that is a multiple of a3 and greater than the year the second sign occurred, and so on.

So, for each sign i, find the smallest year y that is a multiple of a_i and y > previous_sign_year.

This seems straightforward.

Let's see if this logic matches the first example.

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

Start with year 0.

First sign: smallest multiple of 3 > 0 → year 3.

Second sign: smallest multiple of 2 > 3 → year 4.

Third sign: smallest multiple of 4 > 4 → year 8.

Wait, but 4 is a multiple of 4 and it's equal to 4, but the problem says strictly after, so maybe it's year 8.

Wait, but 4 is greater than 3, so it should be allowed.

Wait, but according to the explanation, it's year 4.

Then fourth sign: smallest multiple of 5 > 4 → year 5.

Fifth sign: smallest multiple of 9 > 5 → year 9.

Sixth sign: smallest multiple of 18 > 9 → year 18.

Wait, but according to the explanation, it's year 36.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the explanation, it says:

- First sign in year 3.

- Second sign in year 4.

- Third sign in year 8.

- Fourth sign in year 10.

- Fifth sign in year 18.

- Sixth sign in year 36.

So, perhaps there's more to it.

Let me read the problem again.

"It has been found out that the i-th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, ...)."

"And for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. If the i-th sign occurred in year x, the tribe starts waiting for the (i+1)-th sign, starting from year x+1."

So, after each sign occurs, they start waiting for the next sign in the next year.

So, for each sign i from 1 to n, find the smallest year y that is a multiple of a_i and y > previous_sign_year.

Let's apply this to the first example:

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

Initialize previous_year = 0.

First sign: smallest y where y is multiple of 3 and y > 0 → y=3.

Second sign: smallest y where y is multiple of 2 and y > 3 → y=4.

Third sign: smallest y where y is multiple of 4 and y > 4 → y=8.

Wait, but 4 is a multiple of 4 and y > 4 would be y=8.

Fourth sign: smallest y where y is multiple of 5 and y > 8 → y=10.

Fifth sign: smallest y where y is multiple of 9 and y > 10 → y=18.

Sixth sign: smallest y where y is multiple of 18 and y > 18 → y=36.

Yes, this matches the explanation.

So, the logic seems correct.

Now, let's see how to implement this efficiently.

We need to process each sign one by one, keeping track of the previous sign's year, and find the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than the previous year.

Mathematically, for each a_i, given a previous year p, find the smallest y such that y is a multiple of a_i and y > p.

This can be calculated as y = ceil((p + 1) / a_i) * a_i.

In other words, find the smallest multiple of a_i that is strictly greater than p.

Now, in code, to compute ceil((p + 1) / a_i), we can use (p + 1 + a_i - 1) // a_i * a_i.

This avoids using floating-point operations.

Let's verify this formula with the first example.

Initialize p = 0.

First sign: y = ceil((0 + 1) / 3) * 3 = ceil(1 / 3) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3.

Second sign: y = ceil((3 + 1) / 2) * 2 = ceil(4 / 2) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4.

Third sign: y = ceil((4 + 1) / 4) * 4 = ceil(5 / 4) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8.

Fourth sign: y = ceil((8 + 1) / 5) * 5 = ceil(9 / 5) * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10.

Fifth sign: y = ceil((10 + 1) / 9) * 9 = ceil(11 / 9) * 9 = 2 * 9 = 18.

Sixth sign: y = ceil((18 + 1) / 18) * 18 = ceil(19 / 18) * 18 = 2 * 18 = 36.

Perfect, matches the example.

Now, let's see another example to confirm.

Second test case:

n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

According to the output, the year is 5.

Let's compute:

Initialize p=0.

First sign: y = ceil((0+1)/1)*1 = 1*1=1.

Second sign: y = ceil((1+1)/2)*2 = ceil(2/2)*2=1*2=2.

Third sign: y = ceil((2+1)/3)*3=ceil(3/3)*3=1*3=3.

Fourth sign: y = ceil((3+1)/4)*4=ceil(4/4)*4=1*4=4.

Fifth sign: y = ceil((4+1)/5)*5=ceil(5/5)*5=1*5=5.

So, the final year is 5, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

Expected output: 5.

Initialize p=0.

First sign: y=ceil((0+1)/1)*1=1*1=1.

Second sign: y=ceil((1+1)/1)*1=2*1=2.

Third sign: y=ceil((2+1)/1)*1=3*1=3.

Fourth sign: y=ceil((3+1)/1)*1=4*1=4.

Fifth sign: y=ceil((4+1)/1)*1=5*1=5.

Matches the sample output.

Last test case:

n=6, a=[50,30,711,200,503,1006]

Need to find the year when the sixth sign occurs.

Initialize p=0.

First sign: y=ceil((0+1)/50)*50=1*50=50.

Second sign: y=ceil((50+1)/30)*30=ceil(51/30)*30=2*30=60.

Third sign: y=ceil((60+1)/711)*711=ceil(61/711)*711=1*711=711.

Fourth sign: y=ceil((711+1)/200)*200=ceil(712/200)*200=4*200=800.

Fifth sign: y=ceil((800+1)/503)*503=ceil(801/503)*503=2*503=1006.

Sixth sign: y=ceil((1006+1)/1006)*1006=ceil(1007/1006)*1006=2*1006=2012.

Matches the sample output.

So, the logic seems solid.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

The program is:

def func():

num_tests = int(input())

while num_tests > 0:

num_tests -= 1

n = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

start_year = 0

for x in range(0, len(nums)):

start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

print(start_year)

Let's analyze this.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the list of a_i's.

It initializes start_year to 0.

Then, for each sign, it updates start_year as follows:

start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

Let's see what this does.

start_year // nums[x] gives the number of times nums[x] fits into start_year.

Adding 1 gives the next multiple.

Multiplying back by nums[x] gives the smallest multiple of nums[x] that is strictly greater than start_year.

Wait, no.

If start_year is divisible by nums[x], then start_year // nums[x] is exact, and (start_year // nums[x]) * nums[x] = start_year.

But in the program, it's (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x], which would be the next multiple beyond start_year.

But, if start_year is already a multiple of nums[x], this would give the next multiple.

But according to our earlier logic, we need the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than the previous sign's year.

So, if previous_year is p, and a_i is nums[x], then y = ceil((p + 1) / nums[x]) * nums[x].

Now, ceil((p + 1) / nums[x]) is equal to (p + 1 + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x] = (p + nums[x]) // nums[x].

Then, y = ((p + nums[x]) // nums[x]) * nums[x].

But in the program, it's (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x].

Wait, start_year // nums[x] is the integer division.

If start_year is a multiple of nums[x], then start_year // nums[x] * nums[x] = start_year.

Adding 1 to the quotient gives the next multiple.

If start_year is not a multiple of nums[x], then start_year // nums[x] * nums[x] is the largest multiple less than or equal to start_year, and adding 1 gives the next multiple.

Wait, but we need the smallest multiple greater than start_year.

So, if start_year is a multiple of nums[x], then the next multiple is start_year + nums[x].

Else, it's the next multiple.

So, the expression in the program seems correct.

It's effectively computing the smallest multiple of nums[x] that is strictly greater than start_year.

This matches our earlier formula.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Let's verify with the first test case.

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

start_year starts at 0.

First iteration, x=0, nums[0]=3.

start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3.

Second iteration, x=1, nums[1]=2.

start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (1 + 1) * 2 = 4.

Third iteration, x=2, nums[2]=4.

start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (1 + 1) * 4 = 8.

Fourth iteration, x=3, nums[3]=5.

start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (1 + 1) * 5 = 10.

Fifth iteration, x=4, nums[4]=9.

start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = (1 + 1) * 9 = 18.

Sixth iteration, x=5, nums[5]=18.

start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = (1 + 1) * 18 = 36.

Matches the sample.

Another test case:

n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

start_year=0.

First: (0//1 + 1)*1=1.

Second: (1//2 +1)*2=1*2=2.

Third: (2//3 +1)*3=0*3=0, but according to our earlier calculation, it should be 3.

Wait, no.

Wait, 2//3 is 0, then +1=1, then *3=3.

Yes, my mistake.

Fourth: (3//4 +1)*4=0*4=0, but according to earlier, it should be 4.

Wait, 3//4 is 0, +1=1, *4=4.

Fifth: (4//5 +1)*5=0*5=0, but should be 5.

Again, 4//5 is 0, +1=1, *5=5.

So, it's correct.

I mistakenly thought that (2//3 +1)*3 was 0, but actually, 2//3 is 0, +1=1, *3=3.

So, it's correct.

Hence, the program seems to correctly implement the required logic.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]

**Correctness:**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
