Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what the operation does. Essentially, for any number that is at least 10, I can split it into its individual digits and insert them in place of the number. So, for example, 12 becomes 1 and 2, 45 becomes 4 and 5, and so on.

The goal is to check if, after possibly splitting some numbers, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

I need to think about how to approach this. One way is to consider all possible ways of splitting the numbers and check if any of those configurations result in a sorted array. However, this sounds computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 50, and each number can be up to 99, meaning splitting a number into two digits.

Wait, but in the problem, n is up to 50, and a_i is up to 99, which isn't too bad. But considering that for each element that is at least 10, I have a choice to either split it or not, the number of possible configurations could be up to 2^n, which for n=50 is 1e15, which is way too big.

So, that can't be the right approach. There must be a smarter way to handle this.

Let me think differently. I need to end up with a sorted array. So, I need to decide for each element whether to split it or not, in such a way that the resulting array is sorted.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where each node represents a choice for an element (split or not), and I need to find a path that leads to a sorted array.

But that seems complicated. Let's consider the properties of the operation.

First, splitting a number into digits can only decrease the value, since digits are at most 9, and the original number is at least 10.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. For example, 12 splits into 1 and 2, both of which are less than 12, but for 45, it splits into 4 and 5, which are both less than 45.

Wait, but in the first example, they split 12 into 1 and 2, and the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

But in the second example, [12, 28, 5], splitting 12 into 1 and 2 would give [1, 2, 28, 5], which is not sorted. Splitting 28 into 2 and 8 would give [12, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted. Splitting 12 and 28 would give [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted. So, in this case, it's impossible to sort the array.

In the third example, [0, 0], it's already sorted, so no need to split anything.

So, the key is to decide for each element whether to split it or keep it, such that the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

But as I thought earlier, checking all possible combinations is not feasible due to time constraints.

Is there a way to optimize this?

Let me consider that for each element, if it's less than 10, I have no choice but to keep it as is. If it's at least 10, I have two options: keep it as is or split it into its digits.

Wait, but splitting it into digits inserts them in the same position, so the digits are treated as separate elements in the array.

So, the array can increase in length depending on how many numbers I decide to split.

For example, starting with [12, 3, 45, 67], if I split 12 and 45, the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5,67]. If I split only 45, it becomes [12,3,4,5,67]. And so on.

I need to find if there's a combination of splits that results in a sorted array.

Given that n is up to 50, and each a_i is up to 99, which means that splitting a number increases the array length by at most one (since 99 splits into two digits).

So, the maximum possible length of the array after splitting all possible elements is n + something. Wait, no, for each number >=10, splitting it increases the array length by one, because you're replacing one number with two numbers.

Wait, no, more precisely, splitting a number >=10 replaces it with two numbers, so the length increases by one for each split.

For example, [12,3,45,67]:

- Split 12: [1,2,3,45,67], length increases by 1.

- Split 45: [1,2,3,4,5,67], length increases by 1.

- Split 67: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], length increases by 1.

So, splitting all possible elements maximally increases the array length.

But in this problem, we don't need to split all elements; we just need to split some elements to make the array sorted.

So, how can I determine which elements to split?

I need to ensure that after splitting, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

I need to consider the possible values that each position can take.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it this way: for each position, if the number is >=10, it can either stay as is or be split into two digits.

So, for each position, there are two possibilities: keep the number as is or split it into digits.

Then, I need to check all possible combinations of these choices to see if any of them result in a sorted array.

But as I thought earlier, with n=50, 2^50 is too large.

So, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that splitting a number always results in smaller or equal values.

Wait, no, splitting 10 into 1 and 0 actually introduces a 0, which is less than 10.

But in general, splitting a number >=10 into its digits can only make the values smaller or stay the same (in case of digits being equal to the original number, which only happens for single-digit numbers, but those are less than 10).

Wait, but 10 splits into 1 and 0, both less than 10.

45 splits into 4 and 5, both less than 45.

12 splits into 1 and 2, both less than 12.

So, splitting a number >=10 always results in digits that are less than or equal to the original number.

Hence, splitting a number can only help in making the array sorted if the previous element is larger than the current one.

Wait, no. If the previous element is larger than the current one, splitting the current element to make it smaller could help.

But in some cases, splitting the previous element might be necessary.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the possibilities for each position.

Let me try to model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the index in the original array, and j represents the state of splitting up to that point.

But this seems complicated because j could represent many things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value seen so far, considering the possibilities of splitting.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the array and for each position, consider the possible values it can take (either the number itself if not split, or its digits if split), and ensure that it's greater than or equal to the previous element's value.

This sounds similar to building a sorted array by choosing from possible values at each position.

So, I can think of each position having a set of possible values: if the number is less than 10, only one possibility (keep it as is); if the number is >=10, two possibilities: keep it as is or split it into its digits.

Then, I need to choose one possibility for each position such that the resulting array is sorted.

This sounds like a graph where each node is a position and its chosen value, and edges connect compatible choices.

But again, this seems too time-consuming for n=50.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that splitting a number can only help in making the array sorted if it allows the current element to be smaller, which might help in satisfying the sorted condition with the previous element.

But perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum possible value at each position, considering the splits.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the minimal possible value at each position to make sure the array is sorted.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look at the examples again.

In the first example:

4

12 3 45 67

After splitting 12, it becomes [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

So, by splitting 12, we get smaller elements that help in sorting.

In the second example:

3

12 28 5

If we split 12: [1,2,28,5] – not sorted.

Split 28: [12,2,8,5] – not sorted.

Split both: [1,2,2,8,5] – not sorted.

Split neither: [12,28,5] – not sorted.

Hence, it's impossible to sort this array.

In the third example:

2

0 0

Already sorted, no need to split.

So, I need to find a way to decide which elements to split, if any, to make the array sorted.

Given the constraints, n is up to 50, which is small enough that perhaps a dynamic programming approach could work.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][max_val], where i is the current index in the array, and max_val is the maximum value chosen up to that point.

But I need to track more information, because at each step, I might have split previous elements, which affects the current position.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the previous value in the sequence.

So, define dp[i][prev], where i is the current index, and prev is the value of the previous element in the sequence.

Then, for each position i, I can choose to split or not split the element at i, depending on its value and the prev value.

But with n=50 and prev can be up to 99, this might be feasible.

Wait, but prev can be up to 99, and i up to 50, so dp[50][100], which is manageable.

But I need to consider that splitting an element increases the number of elements in the array, so the indices might not align directly.

Wait, this seems tricky.

Maybe I need to think recursively.

Define a function that, given the current index and the previous value, tries to build the sequence.

At each step, for the current index, if the value is less than 10, just check if it's >= prev, and if so, proceed to the next index with the current value as prev.

If the value is >=10, I have two choices: keep it as is or split it into its digits.

- If I keep it, check if a_i >= prev, then proceed to the next index with a_i as prev.

- If I split it, insert its digits in place, and consider them as separate elements.

But splitting increases the number of elements, so I need to handle that.

This seems complicated because splitting affects the sequence length.

Perhaps I need to precompute all possible sequences by splitting or not splitting each element, and then check if any of those sequences are sorted.

But again, with n=50, that's not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are smaller than the original number, which allows for a better alignment with the previous element.

But in reality, splitting can make the array longer, which might make it harder to sort, or easier, depending on the situation.

Wait, maybe I can consider the minimal possible value at each position by choosing to split or not, and see if the minimal possible sequence is sorted.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I try to build the sorted array step by step.

Start with the first element. If it's less than 10, it stays as is. If it's >=10, I can choose to split it or keep it.

Then, move to the next element, and so on.

At each step, I need to ensure that the current choice (split or not) results in a sequence that is >= the previous element.

But this still seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a position in the array and the choice made (split or not), and edges connect compatible choices.

Then, I can search for a path from the first position to the last that maintains the sorted order.

But implementing this seems too complex for the time constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that for the array to be sorted, for every pair of consecutive elements, the earlier one should be less than or equal to the later one.

So, I need to ensure that after all splits, for every two consecutive elements in the final array, the left one is <= the right one.

Now, considering that splitting an element can insert multiple digits in place, which can affect the comparison with neighboring elements.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of possible insertions.

For each element that is >=10, I can choose to keep it as is or split it into its digits.

Then, I need to check if there exists a sequence where the elements are in non-decreasing order.

But I still need a way to efficiently check all possible sequences.

Maybe I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value seen so far, and decide whether to split based on that.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and whenever the current element is smaller than the previous one, consider splitting the current or previous element to fix the order.

But this seems too simplistic and might not cover all cases.

Let me try with the first example:

[12,3,45,67]

- Start with 12. Previous = 12.

- Next 3 < previous (12), so need to fix.

- Option: split 12 into [1,2], so the array becomes [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

- Option: split 3 into [3], but it's already less than 12, so splitting doesn't help.

- So, splitting the previous element (12) helped in making the array sorted.

In the second example:

[12,28,5]

- Start with 12. Previous =12.

- Next 28 >=12, so no issue.

- Next 5 < previous (28), so need to fix.

- Option: split 28 into [2,8], so array becomes [12,2,8,5]. Is this sorted? 12 >=2, which breaks the order.

- Option: split 5 into [5], doesn't help.

- Option: split both 28 and 5: [12,2,8,5], still not sorted.

- Option: split 12 into [1,2], so array becomes [1,2,28,5]. Is this sorted? 1 <=2 <=28 >=5, not sorted.

- So, no way to make it sorted.

In the third example:

[0,0]

Already sorted.

So, in the first example, splitting the previous element helped in making the array sorted.

In the second example, no splitting could make it sorted.

So, perhaps the strategy is: whenever a[i] < previous, consider splitting a[i] or the previous element to make a[i] >= previous.

But in the first example, splitting the previous element helped.

So, maybe I need to consider splitting the previous element when a[i] < previous.

Wait, but in the first example, splitting the previous element (12) into [1,2] made the array [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

So, it worked.

But in the second example, splitting the previous element (28) into [2,8] would make the array [12,2,8,5], where 12 >=2, which breaks the order.

So, it's not always beneficial to split the previous element.

Maybe I need to consider both options: splitting the current element or the previous element, and see which one helps in making the array sorted.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that splitting a number can be seen as inserting its digits in place, which can be treated as if the array is expanded at that point.

So, perhaps I can simulate the process by considering all possible splits.

But with n=50, this is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for the array to be sorted, for every position, after considering splits, the elements should be in non-decreasing order.

So, for each position, I need to choose whether to split or not, such that the resulting sequence is sorted.

But again, this seems too broad.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal possible value at each position by choosing to split or not, and see if that sequence is sorted.

In other words, for each element, choose the smallest possible value by deciding whether to split or not, and see if that results in a sorted array.

But in the first example, choosing to split 12 gives smaller values [1,2], which helps in making the array sorted.

In the second example, even with splitting, it's impossible to make the array sorted.

So, perhaps this approach could work.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a function that, given the current index and the previous value, tries to proceed to the end of the array while maintaining the sorted order.

At each step, for the current element:

- If it's less than 10, no choice: keep it as is.

- If it's >=10, choose to split or not.

- If splitting, insert its digits and consider them as separate elements.

- Ensure that each inserted element is >= the previous value.

Wait, but splitting can insert multiple elements, which complicates the indexing.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that the operation of splitting can be applied multiple times, but in practice, splitting a number that has already been split doesn't change anything, since splitting digits wouldn't do anything (digits are less than 10 and can't be split further).

So, perhaps I can consider the array after all possible splits have been applied, meaning that the array consists only of digits (numbers less than 10), except for numbers that are less than 10 and weren't split (but they can't be split anyway).

Wait, but numbers less than 10 can't be split.

So, the final array will consist of numbers that are less than 10, possibly with some numbers that were split into digits.

So, perhaps I can think of the operation as allowing me to replace any number >=10 with its digits, and I can do this operation any number of times, but in practice, once a number is split, it's already in digits, so no further splitting is needed.

Hence, the final array will consist of all elements being less than 10, except for those that were not split, which are >=10.

But in reality, splitting a number >=10 always results in digits less than 10, so if I split all numbers >=10, the final array will consist only of digits less than 10.

But in the problem, I can choose to split some numbers and not others, as long as the resulting array is sorted.

So, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider that the final array will be a sequence of digits and possibly some numbers >=10 that weren't split.

But this seems too broad.

Let me consider that for each number >=10, I have two choices: keep it as is or split it into its digits.

Then, the final array will be a combination of the original numbers kept as is (if <=9 or chosen not to split if >=10), or their digits if split.

I need to choose for each such number whether to split or not, such that the resulting array is sorted.

Given that n is up to 50, and t is up to 1000, I need an efficient way to check for each test case if such a combination exists.

I need to find a way to model this efficiently.

Another idea: since splitting a number >=10 always results in smaller or equal values, perhaps I can greedily decide to split a number if it's greater than the next number.

Wait, in the first example, 12 >3, so I split 12 to get [1,2], which are both less than 12 and allow the array to be sorted.

In the second example, 12 >5, but splitting 12 gives [1,2], which are less than 5, but the sequence still isn't sorted because of the position of other elements.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and whenever a[i] > a[i+1], consider splitting a[i] or a[i+1].

But this seems too simplistic.

Let me try with the first example:

[12,3,45,67]

- Check 12 and 3: 12 >3, so consider splitting 12: [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

- Alternatively, splitting 3 doesn't help since 3 is already less than 12.

In the second example:

[12,28,5]

- Check 12 and 28: 12 <=28, no issue.

- Check 28 and 5: 28 >5, so consider splitting 28: [12,2,8,5], which isn't sorted.

- Alternatively, splitting 5 doesn't help.

- Splitting both: [12,2,8,5], still not sorted.

Hence, it's impossible to sort this array.

In the third example:

[0,0]

Already sorted.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the array and whenever a[i] > a[i+1], consider splitting a[i] or a[i+1], and see if that helps in making the array sorted.

But I need to consider that splitting a[i] or a[i+1] can affect the sequence, and I need to ensure that the entire sequence is sorted after all splits.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that the operation of splitting can be seen as inserting digits in place of a number, and I can perform this operation multiple times.

But in reality, splitting a number once into its digits is sufficient, since digits can't be split further.

Hence, for each number >=10, I can choose to split it once or not.

So, for each such number, I have two choices: split or not split.

Then, the final array will be a combination of the original numbers (if not split) or their digits (if split).

I need to check if there exists a combination where the final array is sorted.

Given that n is up to 50, and each number can be split or not, leading to 2^n possibilities, which is too much, I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a choice for an element (split or not), and edges connect compatible choices that maintain the sorted order.

Then, I can search for a path from the start to the end that maintains the sorted order.

But implementing this seems too complex.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I consider the array after all possible splits have been performed.

In this final array, each element is a digit (less than 10), or a number that wasn't split (which could be >=10).

But in reality, splitting a number >=10 always results in digits less than 10, so if I choose to split a number >=10, the final array will have those digits inserted in place.

Hence, the final array will consist of a mixture of original numbers that weren't split and digits from numbers that were split.

I need to arrange these choices such that the entire array is sorted.

This seems too vague to implement efficiently.

Let me consider that for each number >=10, I can choose to keep it as is or split it into its digits.

Then, for the array to be sorted, for every two consecutive elements, the left one should be less than or equal to the right one.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the array and whenever a conflict arises (a[i] > a[i+1]), consider splitting a[i] or a[i+1] to resolve the conflict.

But I need to ensure
