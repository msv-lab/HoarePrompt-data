Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find an array of length n such that exactly k of its cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift is. From the description, the x-th cyclic shift of the array a is obtained by taking the elements starting from the x-th position and then wrapping around to the beginning. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 3], the cyclic shifts are:

- x=1: [1, 2, 3, 3]

- x=2: [2, 3, 3, 1]

- x=3: [3, 3, 1, 2]

- x=4: [3, 1, 2, 3]

And among these, only the first one is sorted.

So, my task is to create an array where exactly k out of n cyclic shifts are sorted.

Let me think about the constraints:

- Each element a_i must be between 1 and 10^9.

- The array must have exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

- I need to do this for multiple test cases, up to 10^3, with the sum of n across all test cases not exceeding 10^3.

First, I should consider some small examples to get a feel for the problem.

Let's take n=2 and k=2.

I need an array where both cyclic shifts are sorted.

Possible array: [1, 1]

- Shift 1: [1, 1] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [1, 1] (sorted)

So, k=2 is satisfied.

Another possibility: [1, 2]

- Shift 1: [1, 2] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [2, 1] (not sorted)

Here, k=1.

So, to have k=2 for n=2, all elements must be equal.

Wait, is that always the case?

Let's try n=3 and k=3.

Array: [1, 1, 1]

- Shift 1: [1, 1, 1] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [1, 1, 1] (sorted)

- Shift 3: [1, 1, 1] (sorted)

So, k=3.

Another array: [1, 2, 3]

- Shift 1: [1, 2, 3] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [2, 3, 1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [3, 1, 2] (not sorted)

Here, k=1.

So, for k=3, all elements must be equal.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, for n=3 and k=1, the array [69420, 69, 420] has k=1, which makes sense because only one cyclic shift is sorted.

Now, for n=3 and k=2, the output is -1, meaning no such array exists.

So, I need to figure out for which n and k such an array exists.

Let me consider the general case.

First, if k=0, which is not allowed since k >=1, as per the problem's constraints (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

So, k ranges from 1 to n.

I need to find an array where exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted.

Let me think about the properties of cyclic shifts and sortedness.

Suppose the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Then, the first cyclic shift is sorted by definition.

Now, if I have k=1, it's possible to have only one sorted cyclic shift.

For example, in the array [1, 2, 3], only the first shift is sorted.

Similarly, in [1, 1, 1], all shifts are sorted, so k=3.

Wait, but for n=3, k=2 is impossible, as seen in the example.

So, perhaps for k=n, all elements must be equal.

And for k=1, I can have a strictly increasing array.

But for other values of k, it's not clear.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array where some cyclic shifts are sorted and others are not.

I need exactly k sorted shifts.

Is there a pattern or a formula that relates n and k for which such an array exists?

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of rotations.

Each cyclic shift corresponds to a rotation of the array.

So, if I have an array a, and I rotate it x times, I get the x-th cyclic shift.

I need exactly k rotations that result in a sorted array.

Now, consider that if the array is sorted, then rotating it by any amount will either keep it sorted or make it unsorted, depending on the structure of the array.

For example, if all elements are equal, any rotation keeps it sorted.

If the array is strictly increasing, only the first rotation is sorted.

If the array has some repeated elements or is partially increasing, it might have more than one sorted rotation, but not all.

So, perhaps I can categorize based on k.

Case 1: k=1

In this case, I need exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

This seems achievable by having a strictly increasing array.

For example, [1,2,3,4], where only the first rotation is sorted.

Case 2: k=n

Here, all cyclic shifts must be sorted.

This is only possible if all elements are equal.

Because if any two elements are different, rotating the array so that a smaller element follows a larger one will make that shift unsorted.

So, for k=n, the array must have all elements equal.

Case 3: k divides n?

Wait, maybe there's a relationship between k and n in terms of divisors.

For example, if n is 4 and k is 2, perhaps I can have an array where every other rotation is sorted.

But let's see.

Suppose n=4, k=2.

Is there an array where exactly two rotations are sorted?

Let me try to construct one.

Suppose I have [1,2,1,2].

- Shift 1: [1,2,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 2: [2,1,2,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [1,2,1,2] (same as shift 1)

- Shift 4: [2,1,2,1] (same as shift 2)

So, no sorted shifts.

Not helpful.

Another attempt: [1,2,2,3]

- Shift 1: [1,2,2,3] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [2,2,3,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [2,3,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 4: [3,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift, which is k=1.

Not what I need.

Another try: [1,1,2,2]

- Shift 1: [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- Shift 4: [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

Here, k=2.

So, for n=4 and k=2, this array works.

Interesting.

So, sometimes k does not have to divide n.

But in this case, k=2 for n=4.

Let me see for n=3 and k=2.

Suppose I try [1,2,3]

- Shift 1: [1,2,3] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [2,3,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [3,1,2] (not sorted)

k=1.

Another attempt: [1,1,2]

- Shift 1: [1,1,2] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [1,2,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [2,1,1] (not sorted)

Still k=1.

Another attempt: [1,2,1]

- Shift 1: [1,2,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 2: [2,1,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [1,1,2] (sorted)

Here, k=1 again.

Seems like for n=3, k=2 is impossible.

So, perhaps k must be a divisor of n or something similar.

Wait, in the n=4, k=2 case, it worked, but in n=3, k=2 didn't work.

So, maybe k must divide n, but that's not the case here since 2 divides 4 but not 3.

Wait, 2 doesn't divide 3, which is consistent with k=2 not being possible for n=3.

But in n=4, k=2 worked.

Is there a pattern?

Let me consider n=5 and k=2.

Can I have an array of length 5 with exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts?

Let me try: [1,1,1,1,2]

- Shift 1: [1,1,1,1,2] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [1,1,1,2,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [1,1,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 4: [1,2,1,1,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 5: [2,1,1,1,1] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift, which is k=1.

Another attempt: [1,2,3,4,2]

- Shift 1: [1,2,3,4,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 2: [2,3,4,2,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [3,4,2,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 4: [4,2,1,2,3] (not sorted)

- Shift 5: [2,1,2,3,4] (not sorted)

No sorted shifts.

Another attempt: [1,2,2,3,3]

- Shift 1: [1,2,2,3,3] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [2,2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [2,3,3,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 4: [3,3,1,2,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 5: [3,1,2,2,3] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift again.

Seems like for n=5, k=2 is not possible.

So, perhaps k must be a divisor of n for such an array to exist.

Wait, in n=4, k=2 worked, and 2 divides 4.

In n=3, k=2 didn't work, and 2 does not divide 3.

In n=5, k=2 didn't work, and 2 does not divide 5.

Wait, but in n=4, k=2 worked, but 2 divides 4.

Wait, but in n=4, k=2 worked with [1,1,2,2], which had k=2.

Wait, but in that case, the array had repeating patterns.

Maybe k divides n, but that's not sufficient.

Wait, perhaps k must be 1 or n.

But in n=4, k=2 worked.

Wait, maybe only for k=1 and k=n, such arrays exist.

But in n=4, k=2 worked.

Wait, maybe only when k=1 or k=n.

But in n=4, k=2 worked, so that seems to be a counterexample.

Wait, perhaps for k=1 and k=n, such arrays always exist, and for other k, sometimes they exist, sometimes not.

But in n=4, k=2 existed, but in n=3, k=2 didn't.

So, maybe there's no general rule, and I need to find a way to construct the array based on n and k.

Alternatively, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible for certain arrays.

Wait, but in the example, for n=3 and k=1, an array exists.

For n=3 and k=2, no array exists.

For n=3 and k=3, an array exists (all elements equal).

So, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible, and for some n, k=n/gcd(n,m) for some m.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of sorted shifts being n divided by some cyclic group order.

This might be getting too complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix an array a.

I need exactly k cyclic shifts that are sorted.

Let me consider the array as a circular sequence.

A sorted cyclic shift corresponds to a rotation where the sequence is non-decreasing.

Now, if I have a sorted array, the number of sorted cyclic shifts is equal to the number of times the array repeats its minimal element.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me think.

Suppose the array is [1,1,2,2].

The sorted shifts are:

- [1,1,2,2]

- [2,2,1,1]

So, k=2.

Both shifts that are sorted correspond to rotations starting with the minimal element, which is 1.

Wait, in this case, the minimal element is 1, and there are two 1's.

So, k equals the number of times the minimal element appears.

Wait, in this example, minimal element 1 appears twice, and k=2.

Similarly, in [1,1,1], minimal element 1 appears three times, and k=3.

In [1,2,3], minimal element 1 appears once, and k=1.

So, perhaps in general, k equals the number of times the minimal element appears in the array.

Wait, is that always true?

Let me check.

Take [1,1,2].

Minimal element 1 appears twice.

But earlier, we saw that only one cyclic shift is sorted, which is [1,1,2].

Wait, but according to this hypothesis, k should be equal to the number of times 1 appears, which is twice.

But in reality, only one shift is sorted.

So, the hypothesis is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of distinct starting positions where the rotation begins with the minimal element.

Wait, perhaps k is equal to the number of times the array "resets" its sorted order.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to find a general approach.

I need to find an array where exactly k rotations are sorted.

Let me consider constructing the array in such a way that only the first k rotations are sorted, and the rest are not.

Wait, but rotations are circular, so it's not just the first k; it could be any k rotations.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can look for arrays where the number of sorted rotations is exactly k.

From the earlier observations, it seems that for k=1 and k=n, such arrays exist, and for some other k, they might or might not exist.

But in the problem, for n=3 and k=2, it's impossible.

So, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible for general n.

But in n=4 and k=2, it's possible.

So, maybe for k dividing n, it's possible.

Wait, in n=4 and k=2, 2 divides 4, and it's possible.

In n=3 and k=2, 2 does not divide 3, and it's impossible.

Similarly, in n=4 and k=4, it's possible if all elements are equal.

So, perhaps k must divide n for such an array to exist.

But wait, in n=4 and k=3, does 3 divide 4? No, and from the earlier attempts, it's not possible to have k=3 for n=4.

Wait, but in n=4, k=3 is not considered because k must be less than or equal to n, but in this case, n=4, k=3 is not allowed because it doesn't divide n.

Wait, but in n=4 and k=2, which divides n, it's possible.

In n=3 and k=1, which doesn't divide n, but k=1 is allowed.

Wait, perhaps k must divide n, or k=1.

Wait, in n=3 and k=1, which doesn't divide n, but it's allowed.

Wait, perhaps k must be a divisor of n or k=1.

But in n=4 and k=2, which divides n, it's allowed.

In n=3 and k=1, which doesn't divide n, but it's allowed.

Wait, perhaps it's more about the greatest common divisor.

Wait, perhaps k must be such that gcd(n, k) equals k.

Wait, in n=4 and k=2, gcd(4,2)=2, which equals k.

In n=3 and k=1, gcd(3,1)=1, which equals k.

So, perhaps k must be a divisor of n.

Wait, but in n=4 and k=4, gcd(4,4)=4, which equals k.

So, perhaps k must be a divisor of n.

But in n=4 and k=4, it's allowed by setting all elements equal.

Similarly, in n=3 and k=3, setting all elements equal allows k=3.

In n=4 and k=2, setting two blocks of equal elements, as in [1,1,2,2], gives k=2.

In n=3 and k=3, [1,1,1] gives k=3.

In n=3 and k=1, [1,2,3] gives k=1.

In n=3 and k=2, no such array exists.

So, perhaps only when k divides n, such an array exists.

But in n=4 and k=2, it works.

Wait, but in n=4 and k=2, k divides n.

Similarly, in n=3 and k=3, k divides n.

In n=3 and k=1, k divides n.

In n=5 and k=1, k divides n.

In n=5 and k=5, k divides n.

In n=5 and k=2, k does not divide n, and it's impossible.

So, perhaps the condition is that k divides n.

But in n=4 and k=2, it works.

Wait, but in n=4 and k=2, k divides n.

Similarly, in n=6 and k=3, which divides n, it should work.

Let me try n=6 and k=3.

Construct an array where exactly 3 out of 6 cyclic shifts are sorted.

One way is to have two blocks of equal elements.

For example, [1,1,1,2,2,2].

Let's check the cyclic shifts:

- Shift 1: [1,1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [1,1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [1,2,2,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 4: [2,2,2,1,1,1] (sorted)

- Shift 5: [2,2,1,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 6: [2,1,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

So, only shift 1 and shift 4 are sorted, which is k=2, but I need k=3.

Hmm, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need three blocks.

Let's try [1,1,2,2,3,3].

- Shift 1: [1,1,2,2,3,3] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [1,2,2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [2,2,3,3,1,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 4: [2,3,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 5: [3,3,1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- Shift 6: [3,1,1,2,2,3] (not sorted)

Again, only shift 1 and shift 5 are sorted, which is k=2.

Not k=3.

Another attempt: [1,1,2,2,3,3]

Same as above.

Wait, maybe I need overlapping blocks.

Wait, perhaps [1,1,2,2,2,2]

- Shift 1: [1,1,2,2,2,2] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [1,2,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [2,2,2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- Shift 4: [2,2,2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 5: [2,2,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 6: [2,1,1,2,2,2] (not sorted)

Here, shifts 1 and 3 are sorted, which is k=2 again.

Still not k=3.

Another attempt: [1,1,1,2,2,2]

- Shift 1: [1,1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [1,1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [1,2,2,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 4: [2,2,2,1,1,1] (sorted)

- Shift 5: [2,2,1,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 6: [2,1,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Again, k=2.

Hmm, maybe for n=6 and k=3, it's impossible.

Wait, but 3 divides 6.

So, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, maybe there are additional constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps for k dividing n, such an array exists only if n/k is an integer, which it is since k divides n.

But in this case, n=6 and k=3 should work, but from my attempts, I couldn't find an array with k=3.

Wait, maybe I need to arrange the array in a specific way.

Let me try [1,1,2,2,3,3], but arrange it differently.

Wait, perhaps [1,2,3,1,2,3]

- Shift 1: [1,2,3,1,2,3] (not sorted)

- Shift 2: [2,3,1,2,3,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [3,1,2,3,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 4: [1,2,3,1,2,3] (same as shift 1)

- Shift 5: [2,3,1,2,3,1] (same as shift 2)

- Shift 6: [3,1,2,3,1,2] (same as shift 3)

No sorted shifts.

Another attempt: [1,1,2,2,3,3]

Same as before, k=2.

Seems like for n=6 and k=3, it's impossible.

So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Maybe k must divide n, but in n=6 and k=3, it's possible only if the array is constructed in a specific way.

But from my attempts, I couldn't find such an array.

Alternatively, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible for general n.

But in n=4 and k=2, it's possible, as shown earlier.

So, perhaps only when k equals 1 or n, or when k divides n in a specific way.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look back at the problem.

In the problem statement, for n=3 and k=1, it's possible.

For n=3 and k=2, it's impossible.

For n=3 and k=3, it's possible.

Similarly, for n=4 and k=2, it's possible.

So, perhaps for k=1, k=n, and some other specific k where k divides n, it's possible.

But in n=4 and k=2, it's possible, as shown.

But in n=6 and k=3, from my attempts, it's not possible.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of distinct elements in the array.

Wait, perhaps the number of distinct elements should be n/k.

Wait, in n=4 and k=2, having two distinct elements, each appearing twice, gives k=2.

Similarly, in n=3 and k=3, having one distinct element appearing three times gives k=3.

In n=3 and k=1, having three distinct elements in increasing order gives k=1.

But in n=6 and k=3, if I have two distinct elements, each appearing three times, like [1,1,1,2,2,2], then:

- Shift 1: [1,1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- Shift 2: [1,1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [1,2,2,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 4: [2,2,2,1,1,1] (sorted)

- Shift 5: [2,2,1,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 6: [2,1,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Only shift 1 and shift 4 are sorted, which is k=2.

So, even with two distinct elements, each appearing three times, k=2, not k=3.

So, perhaps for n and k where k divides n, and the array is composed of n/k blocks of equal elements, each block repeated k times.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of periodicity.

If the array is periodic with period n/k, then there would be k sorted shifts.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me consider n=4 and k=2.

Period is 2.

So, blocks of size 2.

Array: [1,1,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

So, k=2.

Similarly, for n=6 and k=2, with period 3.

Array: [1,1,1,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,2,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,2,1,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,2,1,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

So, k=2.

But for n=6 and k=3, if I try with period 2.

Array: [1,1,2,2,3,3]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,3,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,3,3,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,3,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,3,1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [3,1,1,2,2,3] (not sorted)

Again, k=2.

So, perhaps for n and k where k divides n, and the array is composed of n/k blocks of equal elements, each block repeated k times, but in this case, k=2 for n=6, but I need k=3.

Wait, maybe I need three blocks of equal elements, each of size 2.

Array: [1,1,2,2,3,3]

But as above, k=2.

Another attempt: [1,2,3,1,2,3]

- Shift 1: [1,2,3,1,2,3] (not sorted)

- Shift 2: [2,3,1,2,3,1] (not sorted)

- Shift 3: [3,1,2,3,1,2] (not sorted)

- Shift 4: [1,2,3,1,2,3] (same as shift 1)

- Shift 5: [2,3,1,2,3,1] (same as shift 2)

- Shift 6: [3,1,2,3,1,2] (same as shift 3)

No sorted shifts.

Another attempt: [1,1,2,2,3,3]

Same as before, k=2.

Seems like for n=6 and k=3, it's impossible.

So, perhaps only when k divides n and k=1 or k=n, such arrays exist.

But in n=4 and k=2, which divides n, it's possible.

So, maybe there's a different condition.

Alternatively, perhaps only when k is a divisor of n and n/k is even, but in n=4 and k=2, n/k=2, which is even, and it's possible.

In n=6 and k=3, n/k=2, which is even, but from my attempts, it's not possible.

Wait, but earlier, for n=4 and k=2, it's possible, and n/k=2, which is even.

In n=3 and k=3, n/k=1, which is odd, and it's possible.

In n=3 and k=1, n/k=3, which is odd, and it's possible.

In n=2 and k=2, n/k=1, which is odd, and it's possible.

In n=2 and k=1, n/k=2, which is even, and it's possible.

Wait, this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that k divides n, and k <= n/2 +1 or something.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for k=1, I can have a strictly increasing array.

For k=n, all elements equal.

For other k, perhaps arrange the array in a way that there are k blocks of equal elements, each of size n/k.

Wait, in n=4 and k=2, [1,1,2,2], which is two blocks of size 2.

Gives k=2 sorted shifts.

Similarly, in n=3 and k=3, [1,1,1], one block of size 3.

Gives k=3 sorted shifts.

In n=3 and k=1, [1,2,3], strictly increasing.

Gives k=1 sorted shift.

In n=3 and k=2, no such array exists.

So, perhaps for k dividing n, and arranging the array into k blocks of size n/k, with each block having the same value, and the blocks ordered in a non-decreasing manner.

Wait, in n=4 and k=2, [1,1,2,2], which has two blocks of size 2.

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

So, k=2.

Similarly, for n=6 and k=2, [1,1,1,2,2,2].

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,2,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,2,1,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,2,1,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

So, k=2.

But for n=6 and k=3, if I try [1,1,2,2,3,3].

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,3,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,3,3,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,3,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,3,1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [3,1,1,2,2,3] (not sorted)

Only k=2.

Another attempt: [1,1,1,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,2,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,2,1,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,2,1,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Again, k=2.

So, perhaps for n=6 and k=3, it's impossible.

Therefore, maybe only when k divides n and n/k is an integer, but in this case, n=6 and k=3, which divides n, but it's impossible.

So, perhaps only when k divides n and n/k is even or odd in a certain way.

Wait, in n=4 and k=2, n/k=2, which is even, and it's possible.

In n=3 and k=3, n/k=1, which is odd, and it's possible.

In n=6 and k=3, n/k=2, which is even, but from my attempts, it's not possible.

Wait, but in n=3 and k=1, n/k=3, which is odd, and it's possible.

In n=2 and k=2, n/k=1, which is odd, and it's possible.

In n=2 and k=1, n/k=2, which is even, and it's possible.

Wait, perhaps when n/k is an integer, and the blocks are arranged in a certain way.

But in n=6 and k=3, n/k=2, which is even, and I couldn't find an array with k=3.

So, maybe only when n/k is odd, it's possible.

In n=4 and k=2, n/k=2, even, possible.

In n=3 and k=3, n/k=1, odd, possible.

In n=3 and k=1, n/k=3, odd, possible.

In n=2 and k=2, n/k=1, odd, possible.

In n=2 and k=1, n/k=2, even, possible.

In n=6 and k=3, n/k=2, even, not possible.

Wait, but in n=4 and k=2, n/k=2, even, possible.

So, perhaps it's only when n/k is even and n is even, it's possible only if k is even.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to accept that for some n and k, even if k divides n, it's not possible to have exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.

So, perhaps the only general cases where it's possible are k=1 and k=n.

For k=1, use a strictly increasing array.

For k=n, use all elements equal.

For other k, it might or might not be possible based on n and k.

But in the problem, for n=4 and k=2, it's possible.

So, perhaps I need to implement a general approach where:

- If k=1, create a strictly increasing array.

- If k=n, create an array with all elements equal.

- For other k, check if k divides n, and if so, create an array with n/k blocks of equal elements, each block having a different value.

Wait, in n=4 and k=2, [1,1,2,2] works.

In n=6 and k=2, [1,1,1,2,2,2] gives k=2.

But in n=6 and k=3, I can't find an array that works.

So, perhaps only when k divides n and n/k is even, it's possible.

Wait, in n=4 and k=2, n/k=2, which is even, and it's possible.

In n=6 and k=3, n/k=2, which is even, but it's not possible.

Wait, doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps only when k divides n and n/k is a power of 2.

Wait, in n=4 and k=2, n/k=2, which is a power of 2, and it's possible.

In n=6 and k=3, n/k=2, which is a power of 2, but it's not possible.

Wait, no, in n=6 and k=3, it's not possible, even though n/k=2 is a power of 2.

So, that doesn't hold.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that for k=1 and k=n, such arrays exist, and for other k, it's hit or miss.

So, in the code, I can handle the cases where k=1 and k=n.

For k=1, output a strictly increasing sequence.

For k=n, output all elements equal.

For other k, output -1.

But in the problem description, for n=4 and k=2, an array exists.

So, perhaps I need to handle k=1 and k=n, and for other k, output -1.

But that might not be correct, as per the example.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=2 and k=2, it's possible.

For n=3 and k=1, it's possible.

For n=3 and k=2, it's impossible.

So, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are always possible, and for other k, it's impossible.

But in n=4 and k=2, it's possible.

So, perhaps the general rule is:

- If k=1, output
