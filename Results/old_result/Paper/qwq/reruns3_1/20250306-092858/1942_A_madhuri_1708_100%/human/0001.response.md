Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to create an array of length n, where each element is between 1 and 10^9, and exactly k out of the n cyclic shifts of the array are sorted. If it's not possible, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift is. From the description, the x-th cyclic shift of the array a is a_x, a_{x+1}, ..., a_n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{x-1}. So, it's like rotating the array x-1 times to the left.

For example, if n=4 and the array is [1,2,3,3], the cyclic shifts are:

- x=1: [1,2,3,3] (original array)

- x=2: [2,3,3,1]

- x=3: [3,3,1,2]

- x=4: [3,1,2,3]

And in this case, only the first shift is sorted.

My task is to find an array where exactly k out of these n shifts are sorted.

Let me consider some small cases to get a feel for the problem.

Case 1: n=1, k=1

For n=1, there's only one cyclic shift, which is the array itself. So, any single element array is sorted. So, [1] would work.

Case 2: n=2, k=1

I need exactly one sorted cyclic shift out of two.

Possible array: [1,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2] (sorted)

- [2,1] (not sorted)

So, this satisfies k=1.

Another possible array: [2,1]

Shifts:

- [2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2] (sorted)

Also satisfies k=1.

Case 3: n=2, k=2

I need both shifts to be sorted.

Possible array: [1,1]

Shifts:

- [1,1] (sorted)

- [1,1] (sorted)

Perfect.

Or [2,2], [3,3], etc.

Case 4: n=3, k=1

I need exactly one sorted shift out of three.

Possible array: [69420,69,420] as in the example.

Shifts:

- [69420,69,420] (not sorted)

- [69,420,69420] (sorted)

- [420,69420,69] (not sorted)

So, only one sorted shift.

Another possible array: [3,1,2]

Shifts:

- [3,1,2] (not sorted)

- [1,2,3] (sorted)

- [2,3,1] (not sorted)

Again, only one sorted shift.

Case 5: n=3, k=2

I need exactly two sorted shifts out of three.

Is this possible?

Let's try [1,2,3]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3] (sorted)

- [2,3,1] (not sorted)

- [3,1,2] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Another try: [1,1,1]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1] (sorted)

- [1,1,1] (sorted)

- [1,1,1] (sorted)

All three shifts are sorted, which is k=3, not k=2.

Another try: [1,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2,2] (sorted)

- [2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,1,2] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Another try: [1,2,3]

Same as above.

Another try: [2,1,3]

Shifts:

- [2,1,3] (not sorted)

- [1,3,2] (not sorted)

- [3,2,1] (not sorted)

No sorted shifts.

Seems like for n=3, k=2 is not possible. At least, I can't find an array that satisfies it. Maybe it's impossible.

Case 6: n=4, k=2

Is it possible?

Let's try [1,1,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

Here, two sorted shifts. So, k=2 is possible for n=4.

Another example: [1,2,3,4]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,4] (sorted)

- [2,3,4,1] (not sorted)

- [3,4,1,2] (not sorted)

- [4,1,2,3] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

So, with [1,1,2,2], we have k=2.

Interesting.

Case 7: n=4, k=3

Is it possible?

Let's try [1,2,3,3]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,3] (sorted)

- [2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- [3,3,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,1,2,3] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Another try: [1,2,2,3]

Shifts:

- [1,2,2,3] (sorted)

- [2,2,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,3,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Again, only one sorted shift.

Another try: [1,1,2,3]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,3,1,1] (not sorted)

- [3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

Still, only one sorted shift.

Another try: [1,2,3,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,2] (not sorted)

- [2,3,2,1] (not sorted)

- [3,2,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,2,3] (not sorted)

No sorted shifts.

Seems like for n=4, k=3 is not possible.

Wait, is there any array where exactly three shifts are sorted?

Let me think differently. Maybe if I have multiple elements equal, I can get more sorted shifts.

Try [1,1,1,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,1] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Another try: [1,1,2,2]

Earlier, k=2.

Not k=3.

Seems like for n=4, k=3 is impossible.

So, from these observations:

- For n=1, k=1: possible

- For n=2, k=1: possible

- For n=2, k=2: possible

- For n=3, k=1: possible

- For n=3, k=2: impossible

- For n=4, k=2: possible

- For n=4, k=3: impossible

Is there a pattern here?

It seems that for k=1, it's possible for n>=2.

For k=2, it's possible for some n, but not for others.

Wait, in the code provided, it seems to handle k >=2 differently.

Let me look at the code:

def func():

for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

(n, k) = map(int, s.split())

if k >= 2:

if n == k:

print(*[k for j in range(k)])

else:

print('-1')

else:

print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])

So, the code does the following:

- If k >= 2:

- If n == k, output an array where all elements are k.

- Else, output -1.

- If k ==1:

- Output an array [1,2,3,...,n]

Wait, in the first part, it's checking if k >=2.

But in the problem, k can be from 1 to n.

Wait, the code is handling k >=2 and k ==1 separately.

From the examples:

- For n=2, k=2: output [1,1]

- For n=3, k=1: output [1,2,3]

- For n=3, k=2: output -1

Seems like for k=1, it's outputting [1,2,3,...,n], which works because only one cyclic shift will be sorted, which is the sorted array itself.

For k >=2, it's checking if n == k, and if so, output an array where all elements are k.

So, for n=2, k=2: [1,1]

Wait, in the code, it's printing [k for j in range(k)], so for n=2, k=2, it's [2,2]

Is [2,2] correct for n=2, k=2?

Yes, because both cyclic shifts are [2,2] and [2,2], both sorted.

For n=3, k=3: [3,3,3]

All three shifts are [3,3,3], which are sorted.

So, for k >=2, if n ==k, output [k,k,k,...,k], else -1.

From my earlier cases, for n=4, k=2: [1,1,2,2] works, but according to the code, since k < n, it would output -1, which is incorrect because [1,1,2,2] is a valid array for n=4, k=2.

So, the code is incomplete or incorrect for k >=2 and n !=k.

Wait, in the code, for k >=2 and n ==k, it outputs [k,k,k,...,k], which is correct because all shifts are sorted.

But for k >=2 and n !=k, it outputs -1, which might not always be correct, as in n=4, k=2, [1,1,2,2] is a valid array.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the problem constraints, t <=10^3, and sum of n over all test cases <=10^3.

But in the code, it's reading from open(0), which is standard input.

Now, thinking about the problem more generally.

I need to find an array where exactly k out of n cyclic shifts are sorted.

First, observe that if all elements are equal, then all cyclic shifts are sorted.

So, for k ==n, output [k,k,k,...,k] works.

For k ==1, output [1,2,3,...,n] works, as only the original sorted shift is sorted.

For k ==0, I need no cyclic shifts to be sorted.

Is that possible? Let's see.

If I have [2,1,3], shifts are [2,1,3], [1,3,2], [3,2,1], none of which are sorted.

So, yes, for k==0, some arrays are possible.

But according to the problem, k >=1, so k==0 is not allowed.

Wait, the problem says 1 <=k <=n.

So, k==0 is not considered.

But in the code, it only handles k >=2 and k ==1.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's 1 <=k <=n.

In the code, for k >=2 and n ==k, it outputs [k,k,k,...,k], else -1.

And for k ==1, it outputs [1,2,3,...,n].

But from my earlier cases, for n=3, k=2, it's impossible, so -1 is correct.

For n=4, k=2, it's possible with [1,1,2,2], so the code is incorrect in this case.

So, the code is incomplete.

I need to find a general way to handle any k from 1 to n.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, for k ==n, output [n,n,n,...,n].

For k ==1, output [1,2,3,...,n].

For other values of k, it's trickier.

I need to find an array where exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted.

One idea is to make the array have some repeating elements to increase the number of sorted shifts.

For example, for n=4, k=2, [1,1,2,2] has two sorted shifts.

Similarly, for n=4, k=4, [4,4,4,4] has four sorted shifts.

But for n=3, k=2, I can't find any array that works.

So, maybe for k !=1 and k !=n, it's only possible when n is divisible by (n/k)?

Wait, let's think in terms of the number of sorted shifts.

Suppose the array has a certain structure where some elements are equal, and others are increasing.

Maybe I can model this as having repeating blocks.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the minimal period of the array.

If the array has a minimal period d, then the number of sorted shifts might be n/d.

Wait, let's check:

For [1,1,2,2], n=4, k=2.

The minimal period is 2.

n/d =4/2=2, which matches k=2.

Another example: [1,2,3,4], n=4, k=1.

Minimal period is 4, n/d=1, which matches k=1.

Another example: [1,2,3,3], n=4, k=1.

Minimal period is 4, n/d=1, which matches k=1.

Wait, but [1,1,2,2] has minimal period 2, and k=2.

So, perhaps in general, if the minimal period is d, then the number of sorted shifts is n/d.

If that's the case, then for k to be valid, n must be divisible by k, because n/d =k, so d=n/k.

So, for k to be valid, n must be divisible by k.

Wait, let's check this hypothesis.

From earlier cases:

- n=2, k=2: d=1, n/d=2, which matches.

- n=2, k=1: d=2, n/d=1, which matches.

- n=3, k=1: d=3, n/d=1, which matches.

- n=3, k=3: d=1, n/d=3, which would require n to be divisible by k.

But in this case, n=3, k=3, 3 is divisible by 3.

- n=4, k=2: d=2, n/d=2, which matches.

- n=4, k=4: d=1, n/d=4, which matches.

- n=3, k=2: 3 is not divisible by 2, so no solution.

Hence, the hypothesis is that k must divide n for a solution to exist, except for k=1.

Wait, but for k=1, n can be any value, as long as there's exactly one sorted shift.

Wait, but in the earlier case, for n=3, k=1, it's possible.

Similarly, for n=4, k=1, it's possible.

So, perhaps the general rule is:

- If k ==1, output [1,2,3,...,n]

- If k ==n, output [k,k,k,...,k]

- If k divides n (and k !=1 and k !=n), then output an array with minimal period d =n/k

- Else, output -1

Wait, but in the code, it only handles k >=2 and n ==k, output [k,k,k,...,k], else -1.

So, it's missing the case where k divides n and k !=n.

For example, n=4, k=2, which should be possible with [1,1,2,2], since n/k=2, d=2.

So, the code is incomplete because it doesn't handle the case where k divides n and k !=n.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to generate an array of length \( n \) such that exactly \( k \) out of its \( n \) cyclic shifts are sorted. The solution must consider the constraints provided and handle various edge cases appropriately.

## Approach

1. **Understanding Cyclic Shifts and Sorted Arrays**:
   - A cyclic shift of an array involves rotating its elements in a circular manner.
   - We need to ensure that exactly \( k \) of these shifts result in a sorted array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If \( k = n \), meaning all shifts must be sorted, this is achievable only if all elements in the array are equal.
   - If \( k = 1 \), we can use a strictly increasing array, which naturally has only one sorted shift (the array itself).
   - For other values of \( k \), it's possible only if \( n \) is divisible by \( k \). In such cases, we can construct an array with repeating patterns that satisfy the condition.

3. **General Solution**:
   - For \( k = 1 \), output a strictly increasing sequence.
   - For \( k = n \), output an array where all elements are equal to \( k \).
   - For other \( k \), check if \( n \) is divisible by \( k \):
     - If yes, construct an array with a repeating pattern of length \( \frac{n}{k} \).
     - If not, output -1 as it's impossible to satisfy the condition.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    for i in range(1, t + 1):
        n_k = data[i].split()
        n = int(n_k[0])
        k = int(n_k[1])
        if k == 1:
            print(' '.join(map(str, range(1, n + 1))))
        elif k == n:
            print(' '.join(map(str, [k] * n)))
        else:
            if n % k == 0:
                d = n // k
                base = list(range(1, d + 1))
                arr = []
                for _ in range(k):
                    arr.extend(base)
                print(' '.join(map(str, arr)))
            else:
                print('-1')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

## Explanation

1. **Handling \( k = 1 \)**:
   - Output an array \([1, 2, 3, \ldots, n]\), which has only one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself).

2. **Handling \( k = n \)**:
   - Output an array where all elements are equal to \( k \), ensuring all \( n \) cyclic shifts are sorted.

3. **Handling Other Values of \( k \)**:
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by \( k \). If not, output -1.
   - If \( n \) is divisible by \( k \), create a base pattern of length \( \frac{n}{k} \) with increasing numbers and repeat this pattern \( k \) times to form the array.

This approach ensures that exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted, meeting the problem's requirements efficiently.
