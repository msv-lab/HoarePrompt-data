Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, and m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of array a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for the elements to "match" after rearrangement. I think it means that there are at least k elements in the subsegment that are also in array b, regardless of their positions. So, it's about having at least k common elements between the subsegment and array b, considering their frequencies.

Wait, but the problem says "match the elements of array b," and in the example, it shows that even if you reorder the subsegment, as long as at least k elements are the same as in b, it's good. So, it's not just about the presence of k elements, but also considering their counts.

Let me look at the example to clarify:

Example input:

5

7 4 2

4 1 2 3 4 5 6

1 2 3 4

7 4 3

4 1 2 3 4 5 6

1 2 3 4

7 4 4

4 1 2 3 4 5 6

1 2 3 4

11 5 3

9 9 2 2 10 9 7 6 3 6 3

6 9 7 8 10

4 1 1

4 1 5 6

6

Output:

4

3

2

4

1

So, for the first test case, n=7, m=4, k=2, a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6], b=[1,2,3,4]. It says there are 4 good subsegments.

Let's list all subsegments of length 4:

Positions 1-4: [4,1,2,3] -> can be reordered to [1,2,3,4], which matches b completely, so at least 2 match.

Positions 2-5: [1,2,3,4] -> same as above.

Positions 3-6: [2,3,4,5] -> can be reordered to [2,3,4,5], which has 3 elements matching b: 2,3,4.

Positions 4-7: [3,4,5,6] -> can be reordered to [3,4,5,6], which has 2 elements matching b: 3,4.

So, all four subsegments have at least 2 matching elements with b after rearrangement.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, for the second test case: n=7, m=4, k=3, a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6], b=[1,2,3,4].

Subsegments:

1-4: [4,1,2,3] -> [1,2,3,4] matches all 4 with b, which is more than k=3.

2-5: [1,2,3,4] -> same as above.

3-6: [2,3,4,5] -> [2,3,4,5] matches 3 with b: 2,3,4.

4-7: [3,4,5,6] -> [3,4,5,6] matches 2 with b: 3,4. But k=3, so this is not good.

So, only the first three subsegments are good.

Output is 3, which matches.

Third test case: n=7, m=4, k=4, a=[4,1,2,3,4,5,6], b=[1,2,3,4].

Subsegments:

1-4: [4,1,2,3] -> [1,2,3,4] matches all 4 with b.

2-5: [1,2,3,4] -> same as above.

3-6: [2,3,4,5] -> [2,3,4,5] matches 3 with b: 2,3,4. Less than k=4.

4-7: [3,4,5,6] -> [3,4,5,6] matches 2 with b: 3,4.

So, only the first two subsegments are good. Output is 2, matches.

Fourth test case: n=11, m=5, k=3, a=[9,9,2,2,10,9,7,6,3,6,3], b=[6,9,7,8,10].

Subsegments:

1-5: [9,9,2,2,10] -> sorted: [2,2,9,9,10]. Comparing with b: 9,10 match. Only 2 matches, less than k=3.

2-6: [9,2,2,10,9] -> sorted: [2,2,9,9,10]. Matches 9,10. Only 2.

3-7: [2,2,10,9,7] -> sorted: [2,2,7,9,10]. Matches 7,9,10. Three matches.

4-8: [2,10,9,7,6] -> sorted: [2,6,7,9,10]. Matches 6,7,9,10. Four matches.

5-9: [10,9,7,6,3] -> sorted: [3,6,7,9,10]. Matches 6,7,9,10. Four matches.

6-10: [9,7,6,3,6] -> sorted: [3,6,6,7,9]. Matches 6,7,9. Three matches.

7-11: [7,6,3,6,3] -> sorted: [3,3,6,6,7]. Matches 6,7. Only two.

So, subsegments 3-7, 4-8, 5-9, 6-10 are good. Total 4, matches output.

Last test case: n=4, m=1, k=1, a=[4,1,5,6], b=[6].

Subsegments:

1-1: [4] -> doesn't match 6.

2-2: [1] -> doesn't match 6.

3-3: [5] -> doesn't match 6.

4-4: [6] -> matches 6.

Only one good subsegment, matches output.

So, the problem is clear. I need to iterate through all subsegments of a of length m, and for each one, check if after sorting, at least k elements match with the sorted b.

But since n and m can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with sum of n and m over all test cases up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

A brute-force approach would be, for each test case, to iterate through all possible subsegments of a of length m, sort them, sort b, and count the number of matching elements. If it's at least k, increment the answer.

But this would be O(t * n * m), which is too slow because t can be up to 1e4 and n up to 2e5, making it up to 2e9 operations, which is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about it differently. Since the order doesn't matter after sorting, I can think in terms of frequency counts.

I need to count, for each subsegment of a of length m, the number of unique elements that are also in b, considering their frequencies.

Wait, but it's not just unique elements, because duplicates matter.

For example, if b has two 2's, and the subsegment has at least two 2's, then those count towards k.

So, I need to consider the frequency of each element in b and in the subsegment.

I need to count, for each subsegment, the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element in b and in the subsegment.

Wait, that sounds like the intersection of two multisets.

So, for two arrays x and y, the intersection count is the sum over all elements of the minimum of their frequencies in x and y.

Yes, that's what I need.

So, for each subsegment of a of length m, I need to compute the intersection count with b, and check if it's at least k.

Now, computing this directly for every subsegment would still be too slow.

I need a sliding window approach where I can efficiently compute the intersection count as I slide the window over a.

Let me think about maintaining a frequency counter for the current window of size m.

I can initialize a counter for the first window a[0:m], then, as I slide the window to the right, I add a[new_right] and remove a[new_left -1], updating the counter accordingly.

Then, I need to compute the intersection count with b using this counter.

But computing the intersection count for each window would still be O(m) per window, which is too slow for large n.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the frequency counts for b, and then maintain a counter for the current window, and keep track of the sum of the minimum frequencies for each element.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let cb be the counter (frequency map) of b.

Let cw be the counter of the current window of a.

Then, the intersection count is sum(min(cw[x], cb[x]) for all x).

I need to compute this sum efficiently as I slide the window.

Is there a way to update this sum quickly when I add one element and remove another?

Let's see.

When I add an element y to the window and remove an element z, I need to update the sum.

If y was not in the window before, or if its count was less than cb[y], then adding y could increase the sum by min(cw[y], cb[y]).

Similarly, removing z could decrease the sum by min(cw[z] before removal, cb[z]).

Wait, let's think carefully.

Let me denote:

- Before adding y and removing z:

sum = sum(min(cw[x], cb[x])) over all x.

- After adding y and removing z:

sum' = sum(min(cw'[x], cb[x])) over all x.

I need to find sum' - sum.

But this seems tricky because y and z could be the same or different.

Maybe I can keep track of the current sum and update it based on the changes in cw[y] and cw[z].

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the change in cw[y] and cw[z].

Let me consider that.

Let me denote:

- delta_y = min(cw[y] after addition, cb[y]) - min(cw[y] before addition, cb[y])

- delta_z = min(cw[z] after removal, cb[z]) - min(cw[z] before removal, cb[z])

Then, sum' = sum + delta_y + delta_z.

Wait, but cw[z] after removal is cw[z] before removal minus 1.

Similarly, cw[y] after addition is cw[y] before addition plus 1.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to derive a formula.

Let me consider that for each element x, the contribution to the sum is min(cw[x], cb[x]).

When I add y, cw[y] increases by 1.

- If cw[y] after addition <= cb[y], then sum increases by 1.

- If cw[y] after addition > cb[y], then sum increases by min(1, cb[y] - (cw[y] before addition))

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

If cw[y] before addition < cb[y], then sum increases by 1.

If cw[y] before addition >= cb[y], then sum increases by 0.

Similarly, when removing z:

If cw[z] after removal < cb[z], then sum decreases by 1.

If cw[z] after removal >= cb[z], then sum decreases by 0.

Wait, no.

Wait, when removing z:

If cw[z] before removal > cb[z], then sum remains the same.

If cw[z] before removal == cb[z], then sum decreases by 1.

Wait, let's formalize this.

When adding y:

- If cw[y] before addition < cb[y], then sum increases by 1.

- Else, sum increases by 0.

When removing z:

- If cw[z] after removal < cb[z], then sum decreases by 1.

- Else, sum decreases by 0.

So, in total, sum' = sum + delta_y + delta_z, where:

delta_y = 1 if cw[y] before addition < cb[y], else 0.

delta_z = -1 if cw[z] after removal < cb[z], else 0.

Wait, but I need to compute sum' = sum + delta_y + delta_z.

Wait, actually, I think it's better to track sum directly.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Initialize sum as the intersection count of the first window and b.

Then, for each step:

- Add y to the window: if cw[y] <= cb[y], then sum += 1.

- Remove z from the window: if cw[z] < cb[z], then sum -= 1.

Wait, but when removing z, cw[z] is decreased by 1, so if cw[z] before removal == cb[z], then after removal, cw[z] < cb[z], so sum should decrease by 1.

Otherwise, sum remains the same.

Similarly, when adding y, if cw[y] before addition < cb[y], then sum += 1.

Else, sum remains the same.

Yes, that seems correct.

Let me test this logic with an example.

Take the first test case:

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6], b = [1,2,3,4], m=4, k=2.

Initialize cw for a[0:4] = [4,1,2,3], counter: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1.

cb for b = [1,2,3,4], counter: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1.

sum = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 4.

Which is greater than or equal to k=2, so ans +=1.

Now, slide to a[1:5] = [1,2,3,4], cw updated:

remove a[0]=4, cw[4] =1 -1 =0.

Since cw[4]=0 < cb[4]=1, sum -=1 => sum=3.

add a[4]=5, cw[5]=1, cb[5]=0, so cw[5] <= cb[5] => sum +=0 => sum=3.

sum=3 >=2, ans +=1.

Next, slide to a[2:6] = [2,3,4,5], cw updated:

remove a[1]=1, cw[1]=1 -1=0.

cw[1]=0 < cb[1]=1, sum -=1 => sum=2.

add a[5]=6, cw[6]=1, cb[6]=0, sum +=0 => sum=2.

sum=2 >=2, ans +=1.

Next, slide to a[3:7] = [3,4,5,6], cw updated:

remove a[2]=2, cw[2]=1 -1=0.

cw[2]=0 < cb[2]=1, sum -=1 => sum=1.

add a[6]=6, cw[6]=2, cb[6]=0, sum +=0 => sum=1.

sum=1 <2, ans not incremented.

Total ans=3, but in the first test case, the output is 4.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the first test case, output is 4, but according to this, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum calculation.

Wait, in the first window, sum=4, which is >=2, ans=1.

Second window, sum=3 >=2, ans=2.

Third window, sum=2 >=2, ans=3.

Fourth window, sum=1 <2, ans=3.

But output is 4.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in the first test case, m=4, n=7, so there are 4 windows: 1-4, 2-5, 3-6, 4-7.

According to above, sum for each window:

Window 1: sum=4 >=2, ans=1

Window 2: sum=3 >=2, ans=2

Window 3: sum=2 >=2, ans=3

Window 4: sum=1 <2, ans=3

But output is 4, so something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the sum updates.

Let me try again.

Initialize first window [4,1,2,3], cw: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1.

cb: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1.

sum = 4.

ans +=1.

Slide to [1,2,3,4]:

Remove 4: cw[4]=0 < cb[4]=1, sum -=1 => sum=3.

Add 5: cw[5]=1 <= cb[5]=0? Wait, cb[5]=0, so sum doesn't increase.

sum=3 >=2, ans=2.

Slide to [2,3,4,5]:

Remove 1: cw[1]=0 < cb[1]=1, sum -=1 => sum=2.

Add 6: cw[6]=1 <= cb[6]=0, sum doesn't increase.

sum=2 >=2, ans=3.

Slide to [3,4,5,6]:

Remove 2: cw[2]=0 < cb[2]=1, sum -=1 => sum=1.

Add nothing, since we've reached the end.

sum=1 <2, ans=3.

But output is 4, which means my sum updates are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the sum update logic.

Let me think again.

When adding y:

if cw[y] before addition < cb[y], then sum +=1.

When removing z:

if cw[z] after removal < cb[z], then sum -=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that cw[z] after removal is cw[z] before removal minus 1.

So, if cw[z] before removal == cb[z], then after removal, cw[z] < cb[z], so sum -=1.

If cw[z] before removal > cb[z], then after removal, cw[z] >= cb[z], so sum remains the same.

Similarly, when adding y:

if cw[y] before addition < cb[y], then after addition, cw[y] <= cb[y], so sum +=1.

if cw[y] before addition >= cb[y], then sum remains the same.

Wait, perhaps I need to store cw[y] before and after addition.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define:

- When adding y:

if cw[y] before addition < cb[y], then sum +=1.

- When removing z:

if cw[z] before removal == cb[z], then sum -=1.

Note that cw[z] after removal is cw[z] before removal minus 1.

So, if cw[z] before removal == cb[z], then after removal, cw[z] < cb[z], so sum -=1.

If cw[z] before removal > cb[z], then after removal, cw[z] >= cb[z], so sum remains the same.

Similarly, for adding y:

if cw[y] before addition < cb[y], then after addition, cw[y] <= cb[y], so sum +=1.

if cw[y] before addition >= cb[y], then sum remains the same.

Wait, in the first slide:

Window [4,1,2,3] to [1,2,3,4].

Remove 4: cw[4] before removal =1, cb[4]=1, so sum -=1 => sum=3.

Add 5: cw[5] before addition=0 < cb[5]=0, but cb[5]=0, so sum +=0 => sum=3.

Wait, but according to earlier calculation, sum should be 3.

But according to the example, it should be 4 good subsegments.

Wait, perhaps the condition for adding y is not just cw[y] < cb[y], but cw[y] < cb[y] and cb[y] > 0.

Wait, in the earlier step, cb[5]=0, so even if cw[5]=1, it doesn't contribute to the sum.

So, sum should remain 3.

Similarly, in the next step, removing 1: cw[1]=1 -1=0 < cb[1]=1, sum -=1 => sum=2.

Adding 6: cw[6]=1 < cb[6]=0, but since cb[6]=0, sum doesn't increase.

sum=2 >=2, ans=3.

Next slide:

Removing 2: cw[2]=1 -1=0 < cb[2]=1, sum -=1 => sum=1.

Adding nothing, since we've reached the end.

So, ans=3, but output is 4.

Wait, perhaps my initial sum calculation is wrong.

Wait, in the first window [4,1,2,3], sum=4.

Second window [1,2,3,4], sum=3.

Third window [2,3,4,5], sum=2.

Fourth window [3,4,5,6], sum=1.

So, sum >=2 for the first three windows, ans=3, but output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that cb[y] can be zero.

Wait, in the first window, y=4, cw[4]=1 <= cb[4]=1, sum +=1.

Wait, no, in the initial sum, it's sum of min(cw[x], cb[x]).

Wait, perhaps I need to initialize sum correctly for the first window.

Wait, perhaps I need to precompute the initial sum for the first window and then update it for each slide.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

Initialize cb = Counter(b)

Initialize cw = Counter(a[0:m])

sum_initial = sum(min(cw[x], cb[x]) for x in cb)

Then, for each slide, add a[r] and remove a[l], update sum accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate over the elements in b, since m <= n <= 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but sum of n and m over all test cases up to 2e5.

So, it's manageable.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Define cb = Counter(b)

Define cw = Counter(a[0:m])

sum = sum(min(cw[x], cb[x]) for x in cb)

if sum >=k:

ans +=1

Then, for each r in m to n-1:

cw[a[r]] +=1

if cw[a[r]] == cb[a[r]]:

sum +=1

elif cw[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:

sum +=1

cw[a[r - m]] -=1

if cw[a[r - m]] == cb[a[r - m]] -1:

sum -=1

elif cw[a[r - m]] < cb[a[r - m]]:

sum -=1

if sum >=k:

ans +=1

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the sum based on the changes in cw[y] and cw[z].

Let me think differently.

Define sum = sum(min(cw[x], cb[x])) over all x in cb.

Then, when adding y:

if cw[y] <= cb[y], sum +=1.

Wait, no.

Actually, when adding y:

if cw[y] before addition < cb[y], then sum +=1.

Similarly, when removing z:

if cw[z] after removal < cb[z], then sum -=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to track for each x in cb, the current cw[x] and cb[x].

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Initialize cb = Counter(b)

Initialize cw = Counter(a[0:m])

sum = sum(min(cw[x], cb[x]) for x in cb)

ans = 0

if sum >=k:

ans +=1

for r in range(m, n):

y = a[r]

z = a[r - m]

if y in cb:

if cw[y] < cb[y]:

sum +=1

cw[y] +=1

else:

cw[y] +=1

if z in cb:

if cw[z] <= cb[z]:

sum -=1

cw[z] -=1

else:

cw[z] -=1

if sum >=k:

ans +=1

print(ans)

Wait, in the first slide, y=5, z=4.

cb[y]=0, so sum doesn't change.

cb[z]=1, cw[z] before removal=1, cb[z]=1, so sum -=1.

So, sum=4 -1 =3.

Then, add y=5, cb[y]=0, so sum doesn't change.

So, sum=3.

Similarly, in the next slide, y=6, z=1.

cb[y]=0, sum doesn't change.

cb[z]=1, cw[z] before removal=1, cb[z]=1, sum -=1.

sum=3 -1=2.

Add y=6, cb[y]=0, sum doesn't change.

sum=2 >=2, ans=3.

Next slide, y=None, z=2.

cb[z]=1, cw[z] before removal=1, sum -=1.

sum=2 -1=1.

sum=1 <2, ans=3.

But output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that cb[y] can be zero, and in that case, adding y doesn't increase sum, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps my initial sum calculation is wrong.

Wait, in the first window, [4,1,2,3], sum=4.

Second window, [1,2,3,4], sum=3.

Third window, [2,3,4,5], sum=2.

Fourth window, [3,4,5,6], sum=1.

But according to the problem, all four subsegments are good in the first test case, output is 4.

Wait, perhaps the condition is sum >= k, and in the fourth window, sum=1 >=2 is False, so it's not good.

But the output is 4, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "at least k of them match the elements of array b".

In the first test case, with k=2, even the last subsegment [3,4,5,6] has two matches with b: 3 and 4.

So, it should be considered good.

But according to my sum calculation, sum=1, which is less than k=2.

Wait, perhaps my sum calculation is incorrect.

Wait, sum is the number of matching elements considering their frequencies.

In the last window [3,4,5,6], elements are 3,4,5,6.

In b, elements are 1,2,3,4.

So, 3 and 4 match, so sum should be 2, not 1.

But according to my earlier calculation, sum=1.

So, there must be a mistake in my sum update.

Let me check the sum calculation again.

Initialize cw for [4,1,2,3]: cw={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}, cb={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}.

sum = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 4.

First slide: remove 4, add 5.

cw={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:0,5:1}.

sum = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,0) = 3.

Second slide: remove 1, add 6.

cw={1:0,2:1,3:1,4:0,5:1,6:1}.

sum = min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,0) + min(0,0) = 0 +1 +1 +0 +0 +0 =2.

Third slide: remove 2, add nothing.

cw={1:0,2:0,3:1,4:0,5:1,6:1}.

sum = min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,0) + min(1,0) =0 +0 +1 +0 +0 +0 =1.

Wait, but in the last window, [3,4,5,6], elements are 3,4,5,6.

Matching with b: 3 and 4 are in b, so sum should be 2, not 1.

But according to the sum calculation above, sum=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to only consider elements that are in b when calculating sum.

Wait, perhaps I should only sum over x in b.

Wait, in the sum calculation, I'm summing min(cw[x], cb[x]) for x in cb.

In the last window, cw[3]=1, cb[3]=1 => min=1.

cw[4]=0, cb[4]=1 => min=0.

cw[1]=0, cb[1]=1 => min=0.

cw[2]=0, cb[2]=1 => min=0.

So, sum=1 +0 +0 +0 =1.

But intuitively, sum should be 2, because 3 and 4 are present.

Wait, why is cw[4]=0 in the last window? Because in [3,4,5,6], cw[4]=1.

Wait, no, in the third slide, I removed 2, but cw[4] should still be 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in tracking cw.

Let me simulate the slides again.

Initialize:

cw = {4:1,1:1,2:1,3:1}

cb = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

sum = 4.

ans +=1.

First slide: remove 4, add 5.

cw[4] -=1 => cw[4]=0.

cw[5] +=1 => cw[5]=1.

sum -=1 (since cw[4]<cb[4]) => sum=3.

sum >=2, ans=2.

Second slide: remove 1, add 6.

cw[1] -=1 => cw[1]=0.

cw[6] +=1 => cw[6]=1.

sum -=1 (since cw[1]<cb[1]) => sum=2.

sum >=2, ans=3.

Third slide: remove 2, add nothing.

cw[2] -=1 => cw[2]=0.

sum -=1 (since cw[2]<cb[2]) => sum=1.

sum <2, ans=3.

But in reality, in the last window [3,4,5,6], sum should be 2, not 1.

So, my sum update is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps when removing z=2, cw[2]=1 -1=0 < cb[2]=1, so sum -=1 => sum=1.

But in this window, cw[4]=1 (since 4 is present in [3,4,5,6]), so sum should be min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) =0 +0 +1 +1=2.

Wait, but according to my earlier update, sum=1.

So, there's inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps I need to recalculate sum for the last window.

In the last window, cw={1:0,2:0,3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}.

sum = min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,0) + min(1,0) =0+0+1+1+0+0=2.

So, sum=2 >=2, ans should be 4.

But according to my update, I have sum=1.

So, there's a mistake in my sum update logic.

Let me see.

In the third slide:

- Remove z=2: cw[2]=0 < cb[2]=1, so sum -=1 => sum=1.

But in reality, sum should be 2, not 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when removing z=2, cw[2]=0 < cb[2]=1, so sum -=1.

But in the last window, sum should be 2, which means that perhaps sum shouldn't have been decreased by 1.

Wait, perhaps my condition for sum -=1 is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if cw[z] before removal == cb[z], then sum -=1.

But in this case, cw[2]=1 before removal, which equals cb[2]=1, so sum -=1.

But according to the full sum calculation, sum=2, which is greater than the previous sum after removal.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to implement the sum update differently.

Instead of trying to incrementally update sum, perhaps I should recalculate sum for each window.

But that would be O(m) per window, which is too slow for large n.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain a variable that counts the number of elements in the current window that match b, considering frequencies.

Let me think about it differently.

Let me precompute the positions of each number in a.

Then, for each number in b, I can keep track of its frequency in the current window.

But with n and m up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, I need something more efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can use the sliding window approach with a frequency counter, and keep track of the intersection sum correctly.

Let me try to implement the sum update more carefully.

Define a variable sum_inter.

Initialize sum_inter for the first window.

Then, for each slide:

- Remove z: if cw[z] <= cb[z], then sum_inter -=1.

- Add y: if cw[y] < cb[y], then sum_inter +=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Wait, perhaps when removing z:

if cw[z] <= cb[z], then sum_inter -=1.

And when adding y:

if cw[y] < cb[y], then sum_inter +=1.

Wait, in the last slide:

Remove z=2: cw[2]=1 <= cb[2]=1, so sum_inter -=1 => sum_inter=1.

Add y=None, so sum_inter remains 1.

But according to the full sum calculation, sum should be 2.

So, this is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the number of elements in the intersection.

Wait, maybe I need to track for each x in b, if cw[x] >= cb[x], then add cb[x], else add cw[x].

Wait, no, sum is sum of min(cw[x], cb[x]) for all x in b.

So, perhaps I need to iterate over x in b and sum min(cw[x], cb[x]).

But that's too slow for large m and n.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the sum directly.

Initialize sum_inter for the first window.

Then, for each
