Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, and m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of array a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for the elements to "match" after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are the same as those in b, regardless of their positions. So, it's about having at least k common elements between the subsegment and b, considering their frequencies.

Wait, but it says "match the elements of array b," and considering that b can have duplicates, I need to make sure that the frequencies of the elements are taken into account properly.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

Good subsegments are those where, after rearrangement, at least 2 elements match b.

Looking at the subsegments:

- [4,1,2,3]: After sorting, [1,2,3,4], which matches b completely, so definitely at least 2 match.

- [1,2,3,4]: Same as above.

- [2,3,4,5]: After sorting, [2,3,4,5], which has 3 elements matching b: 2,3,4.

- [3,4,5,6]: After sorting, [3,4,5,6], which has 2 elements matching b: 3,4.

- [4,5,6]: Not of length m=4.

So, there are 4 good subsegments, which matches the first output.

In the second test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

Same a and b.

Good subsegments:

- [4,1,2,3]: After sorting, [1,2,3,4], which matches b completely, so at least 3 match.

- [1,2,3,4]: Same as above.

- [2,3,4,5]: After sorting, [2,3,4,5], which has 3 elements matching b: 2,3,4.

- [3,4,5,6]: After sorting, [3,4,5,6], which has 2 elements matching b: 3,4 (less than k=3, so not good).

So, 3 good subsegments, matching the second output.

Okay, so the problem is to count the number of subsegments of a of length m where, after sorting, at least k elements match with the sorted b.

Wait, but the problem says "the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, it's not necessarily about sorting; it's about rearranging the subsegment to match b in at least k positions.

But in the example, they sorted both to check the matching elements.

I think what's important is the frequency of each element in the subsegment and in b.

We need to ensure that the subsegment has at least k elements that are present in b, considering the frequencies.

So, it's more about the intersection of the frequencies of elements in the subsegment and in b.

Let me think about it in terms of frequency counts.

Let's define frequency counts for b as cb and for the current subsegment as ca.

Then, the number of matching elements would be the sum of the minimum frequencies for each element in both cb and ca.

If this sum is at least k, then the subsegment is good.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for each subsegment of length m in a, compute its frequency count ca, compute the sum of min(ca[x], cb[x]) for all x, and check if this sum is at least k.

If it is, increment the answer counter.

Since n and m can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, we need an efficient way to compute this.

Computing frequency counts for each subsegment separately would be too slow if done naively, as it would be O(n*m).

But since m is up to 2e5, and sum of m over all test cases is up to 2e5, we need a sliding window approach to compute the frequency counts efficiently.

So, we can use a sliding window of size m over a, and maintain a frequency count ca for the current window.

When the window slides by one position, we remove the element that's no longer in the window and add the new element, updating ca accordingly.

We also need to compute the sum of min(ca[x], cb[x]) efficiently.

To do this, I can precompute cb as the frequency count of b.

Then, for each window, compute the sum of min(ca[x], cb[x]) and check if it's >= k.

The challenge is to update this sum efficiently when the window slides.

Let's think about how to maintain this sum efficiently.

Suppose we have the current sum for window [l, l+m-1].

When we slide the window to [l+1, l+m], we remove a[l-1] and add a[l+m-1].

We need to update the sum accordingly.

Let's denote the sum as sm = sum(min(ca[x], cb[x]) for all x).

When we remove a[l-1], ca[a[l-1]] decreases by 1.

If ca[a[l-1]] was less than or equal to cb[a[l-1]], then sm decreases by 1.

Because min(ca[a[l-1]], cb[a[l-1]]) was ca[a[l-1]], and it decreases by 1.

Similarly, when we add a[l+m-1], ca[a[l+m-1]] increases by 1.

If ca[a[l+m-1]] is less than or equal to cb[a[l+m-1]], then sm increases by 1.

Because min(ca[a[l+m-1]], cb[a[l+m-1]]) was ca[a[l+m-1]], and it increases by 1.

Wait, but this might not always be the case.

Let me think carefully.

Suppose ca[x] <= cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) = ca[x].

If we remove one x, ca[x] decreases by 1, so min decreases by 1.

If we add one x, ca[x] increases by 1, so min increases by 1, provided that ca[x] <= cb[x].

But if ca[x] > cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) = cb[x], and adding or removing x doesn't change sm.

So, to summarize:

- When removing x = a[l-1]:

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm decreases by 1.

- Else, sm remains the same.

- When adding x = a[l+m-1]:

- If ca[x] < cb[x], then sm increases by 1.

- Else, sm remains the same.

Wait, but when adding x:

- If ca[x] < cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) increases by 1.

- If ca[x] >= cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) remains cb[x].

Similarly, when removing x:

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) decreases by 1.

- If ca[x] > cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) remains cb[x].

So, in code, it's:

- When removing x:

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm -= 1

- ca[x] -= 1

- When adding x:

- ca[x] += 1

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm += 1

Wait, but actually, when adding x:

- ca[x] increases by 1

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) increases by 1, so sm +=1

- Else, min(ca[x], cb[x]) remains cb[x], so sm doesn't change.

Similarly, when removing x:

- ca[x] decreases by 1

- If ca[x] < cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) decreases by 1, so sm -=1

- Else, min(ca[x], cb[x]) remains ca[x], so sm doesn't change.

Wait, there's a confusion here.

Let me re-express it.

- When removing x:

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) decreases by 1, so sm -=1

- Else, min(ca[x], cb[x]) remains cb[x], so sm doesn't change.

- When adding x:

- If ca[x] < cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) increases by 1, so sm +=1

- Else, min(ca[x], cb[x]) remains cb[x], so sm doesn't change.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, in code:

# When removing x

x = a[l-1]

if ca[x] <= cb[x]:

sm -=1

ca[x] -=1

# When adding x

x = a[l+m-1]

ca[x] +=1

if ca[x] <= cb[x]:

sm +=1

Then, if sm >=k, increment the answer.

Wait, but in the initial window, we need to compute sm directly as sum(min(ca[x], cb[x]) for all x).

Then, for each slide, apply the above updates.

This seems efficient, as it's O(n) per test case.

But, considering t up to 1e4 and sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, it should be acceptable.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this correctly.

The program is:

from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):

cb = Counter(sorted(b))

ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))

ans = 0

sm = sum((ca & cb).values())

if sm >= k:

ans += 1

for r in range(m, n):

if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:

sm += 1

ca[a[r]] += 1

if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:

sm -= 1

ca[a[r - m]] -= 1

if sm >= k:

ans += 1

return ans

Okay, let's analyze this.

First, it initializes cb as Counter of sorted(b), and ca as Counter of sorted(a[:m]).

Then, sm is computed as sum of (ca & cb).values(), which is sum of min(ca[x], cb[x]) for all x.

This is correct.

Then, for each slide of the window:

- It adds a[r] to the window:

- If ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]], then sm +=1

- ca[a[r]] +=1

- Removes a[r - m] from the window:

- If ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]], then sm -=1

- ca[a[r - m]] -=1

- If sm >=k, increment ans.

Now, comparing this to what I derived earlier:

- When adding x = a[r]:

- ca[x] +=1

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm +=1

- When removing x = a[r - m]:

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm -=1

- ca[x] -=1

Wait, there's a discrepancy.

In the given code:

- When adding x = a[r]:

- if ca[x] < cb[x], then sm +=1

- ca[x] +=1

- When removing x = a[r - m]:

- if ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm -=1

- ca[x] -=1

But according to my earlier reasoning:

- When adding x:

- ca[x] +=1

- if ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm +=1

- When removing x:

- if ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm -=1

- ca[x] -=1

So, the condition in the code for adding x is "if ca[x] < cb[x]", but according to my reasoning, it should be "if ca[x] <= cb[x]".

Is there a difference?

Let's think about the case when ca[x] == cb[x].

Suppose ca[x] == cb[x] before adding x.

After adding x, ca[x] increases by 1, so min(ca[x], cb[x]) remains cb[x], which doesn't change because ca[x] > cb[x] now.

But according to the code, it would do sm +=1 if ca[x] < cb[x], which is not the case when ca[x] == cb[x].

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, when adding x:

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm +=1

But in the code, it's if ca[x] < cb[x], then sm +=1.

So, in the case where ca[x] == cb[x], the sum should not increase, because min(ca[x], cb[x]) remains cb[x].

But according to the code, if ca[x] == cb[x], it won't increment sm, which is correct.

Wait, but according to my earlier statement, it should be "if ca[x] <= cb[x]", which would include the case ca[x] == cb[x], and in that case, sm should increase by 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Before adding x:

- If ca[x] < cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) = ca[x]

- After adding x, ca[x] +=1

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) = ca[x], which is increased by 1

- So, sm increases by 1

- If ca[x] > cb[x], then min(ca[x], cb[x]) = cb[x], which remains the same

So, sm increases by 1 if ca[x] <= cb[x] after adding x.

But in the code, it's checking ca[x] < cb[x] before adding x.

Wait, in the code:

- ca[x] +=1

- if ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm +=1

But in the condition, it's checking ca[x] < cb[x] before adding x.

Wait, no, in the code:

if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:

sm += 1

ca[a[r]] += 1

So, it's checking ca[x] < cb[x] before incrementing ca[x].

After incrementing, ca[x] <= cb[x] would be equivalent to ca[x] < cb[x] before incrementing.

Wait, no:

- If ca[x] < cb[x] before adding x, then after adding x, ca[x] <= cb[x]

- If ca[x] == cb[x] before adding x, then after adding x, ca[x] > cb[x]

So, to check if sm should increase by 1 after adding x, we need to see if ca[x] <= cb[x] after adding x.

But in the code, it's checking ca[x] < cb[x] before adding x.

Wait, let's consider:

- If ca[x] < cb[x] before adding x, then after adding x, ca[x] <= cb[x], so sm increases by 1

- If ca[x] == cb[x] before adding x, then after adding x, ca[x] > cb[x], so sm doesn't increase

So, the condition in the code is correct: if ca[x] < cb[x] before adding x, then sm +=1 after adding x.

Similarly, for removing x:

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm -=1 before removing x

Wait, in the code:

if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:

sm -= 1

ca[a[r - m]] -= 1

But according to my earlier reasoning, when removing x, if ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm -=1

Wait, but ca[x] is decreased by 1, so actually:

- Before removing x, if ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm -=1

- After removing x, ca[x] decreases by 1

So, the condition is correct.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking ca[x] <= cb[x] before decreasing ca[x].

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, when removing x:

- If ca[x] <= cb[x], then sm -=1

- ca[x] -=1

So, the code matches this.

Hence, the conditions in the code are correct.

Earlier, I thought there was a discrepancy because I had confused the timing of the condition check relative to the update.

But actually, it's correct as implemented.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The program is correct.}} \]
