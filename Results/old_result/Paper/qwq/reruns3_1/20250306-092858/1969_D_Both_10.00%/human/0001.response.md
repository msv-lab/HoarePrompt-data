Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n items in a shop, each with two prices: a_i for Alice to buy from the shop, and b_i for Bob to buy from Alice. Alice wants to choose a subset of items to buy, and then Bob will either take all of them for free if she buys less than k items, or take k items for free and pay for the rest.

Alice's profit is the amount Bob pays her minus the amount she spends buying the items. She wants to maximize this profit, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to figure out what Alice's profit would be if both act optimally.

First, I need to understand the rules clearly. If Alice buys fewer than k items, Bob takes all of them for free, so Alice's profit would be zero minus the cost she incurred buying those items, which would be negative. That doesn't seem favorable for Alice. So, she probably wants to buy at least k items to make some profit.

When Alice buys at least k items, Bob can take k items for free and pays for the rest. Alice's profit is the sum of b_i for the items Bob buys minus the sum of a_i for the items Alice buys.

Alice wants to maximize this profit, and Bob, being adversarial, wants to minimize it. So, Alice needs to choose which items to buy, knowing that Bob will choose which k items to take for free in a way that minimizes Alice's profit.

Let me try to rephrase this. Alice selects a subset S of items to buy. If |S| < k, Bob takes all of S for free, and Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for i in S). If |S| >= k, Bob chooses k items from S to take for free and pays for the remaining |S| - k items. Alice's profit is then sum(b_i for the items Bob pays for) - sum(a_i for all items in S).

But wait, in the problem statement, it says Bob chooses which k items to take for free, and Alice wants to maximize her profit, knowing that Bob will choose the k items to minimize her profit.

So, Alice needs to select a subset S, and Bob will choose which k items in S to take for free, minimizing Alice's profit.

Alice's profit is sum(b_i for items in S not taken by Bob) - sum(a_i for items in S).

Since Bob takes k items for free, the items he takes are the ones that minimize Alice's profit. That means he would take the items with the smallest b_i, because those are the ones that, if Alice has to sell them to Bob, would reduce her profit the least.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

If Bob takes k items for free, he should take the ones that have the highest b_i, because those are the ones that would contribute the most to Alice's profit if he had to pay for them. By taking them for free, he minimizes her profit.

Wait, but actually, if Bob takes items with high b_i for free, that reduces Alice's potential profit more, because those are the items that would have contributed the most to her profit if he had paid for them.

So, to minimize Alice's profit, Bob should take the k items with the highest b_i for free.

Therefore, Alice needs to select a subset S, and Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i in S for free.

Alice's profit would then be sum(b_i for items in S not taken by Bob) - sum(a_i for items in S).

Alice wants to maximize this profit.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let S be the subset of items Alice chooses to buy.

If |S| < k, Bob takes all items in S for free, and Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for i in S).

If |S| >= k, Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i in S for free, and pays for the remaining |S| - k items.

Alice's profit is sum(b_i for items in S not taken by Bob) - sum(a_i for items in S).

Which simplifies to -sum(a_i for items in S) + sum(b_i for items in S \ k highest b_i items).

Alice wants to maximize this.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let's consider the difference between b_i and a_i for each item.

Wait, but not exactly. Because the way the profit is calculated is sum of b_i for some items minus sum of a_i for all items in S.

Hmm.

Let me try to rearrange the terms.

Alice's profit is:

- sum(a_i for i in S) + sum(b_i for i in S \ T), where T is the set of k items with highest b_i in S that Bob takes for free.

So, profit = -sum(a_i for i in S) + sum(b_i for i in S \ T).

This can be rewritten as sum( (b_i - a_i) for i in S \ T) - sum(a_i for i in T).

But this seems messy.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let's consider that Alice can choose to buy items, and Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i for free.

So, if Alice selects S, Bob will take the k items in S with highest b_i for free.

Then, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S \ T) - sum(a_i for S), where T is the k items in S with highest b_i.

This is equal to sum(b_i for S \ T) - sum(a_i for S).

Let me see if I can simplify this.

This is equal to sum(b_i for S \ T) - sum(a_i for S \ T) - sum(a_i for T).

Which is sum( b_i - a_i for S \ T ) - sum( a_i for T ).

This still seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the items in a certain order.

Let me consider sorting the items based on some criterion.

Perhaps sorting based on b_i - a_i.

Wait, let's think about the profit Alice makes per item.

If Alice buys an item and sells it to Bob, her profit is b_i - a_i.

But, Bob can take k items for free, so Alice only gets to sell some items to Bob, depending on Bob's choice.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Alice wants to maximize the profit from the items she sells to Bob, minus the cost of buying the items.

Given that Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i for free, Alice wants to select a subset where the sum of b_i - a_i for the items not taken by Bob is as large as possible, minus the cost of the items taken by Bob.

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to model this as selecting a subset S, and then removing the k items with highest b_i from S, and then computing the sum of (b_i - a_i) for the remaining items, minus the sum of a_i for the removed items.

Wait, no.

Let me try to think in terms of selecting items to buy and items to sell.

For each item, Alice can choose to buy it or not.

If she buys it, she pays a_i.

Then, Bob can choose to take up to k items for free, selecting the ones with highest b_i.

Alice's profit is the sum of b_i for the items Bob pays for minus the sum of a_i for all items she buys.

This seems tricky because it's a two-step optimization problem.

Perhaps I can approach it by considering that Alice wants to maximize her profit, knowing Bob's strategy.

One way to approach this is to consider that Bob will always take the k items with the highest b_i from the ones Alice selects.

Therefore, Alice should select a subset S such that the sum of b_i for S minus the sum of a_i for S minus the sum of the top k b_i in S is maximized.

Wait, but that's not quite right.

Let's define for a subset S:

Profit = sum(b_i for S \ T) - sum(a_i for S), where T is the k items with highest b_i in S that Bob takes for free.

I need to maximize this over all possible S.

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider different sizes of S and find the optimal S for each size.

But that seems inefficient, especially since n can be up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider the case when k=0.

If k=0, Bob takes no items for free, so he pays for all items Alice buys.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S) - sum(a_i for S) = sum( b_i - a_i for S ).

To maximize this, Alice should select all items where b_i - a_i > 0.

Wait, but if b_i - a_i <= 0, it's better for Alice not to buy that item, because she loses money.

So, in the case k=0, the solution is to select all items where b_i - a_i > 0, and the profit is sum of b_i - a_i for those items.

That seems straightforward.

Now, for general k, it's more complicated.

Let me consider that Alice selects a subset S of size m >= k.

Bob takes the k items with highest b_i in S for free.

Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S \ T) - sum(a_i for S).

Which is sum(b_i for S) - sum(b_i for T) - sum(a_i for S).

So, profit = sum( b_i - a_i for S ) - sum( b_i for T ).

Alice wants to maximize this.

Given that T is the k items in S with highest b_i, Alice needs to choose S such that the sum( b_i - a_i for S ) - sum( b_i for T ) is maximized.

This can be rewritten as sum( -a_i for S ) + sum( b_i for S \ T ).

This is getting messy.

Maybe I can transform the problem.

Let me consider that profit = sum( b_i for S \ T ) - sum( a_i for S ).

Which is sum( b_i - a_i for S \ T ) - sum( a_i for T ).

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can consider selecting S to maximize sum( b_i - a_i for S ) - sum( b_i for T ).

Given that T is the k items in S with highest b_i.

This resembles a maximization problem with a subtraction of the top k b_i.

I need to find a way to optimize this.

Let me think about sorting the items in S based on b_i.

Suppose I sort the items in S in decreasing order of b_i.

Let the items be s1, s2, ..., sm, with b(s1) >= b(s2) >= ... >= b(sm).

Then, T is the first k items, i.e., s1 to sk.

So, profit = sum( b_i - a_i for sk+1 to sm ) - sum( a_i for s1 to sk ).

This is equal to sum( b_i - a_i for sk+1 to sm ) - sum( a_i for s1 to sk ).

I need to maximize this over all possible S.

This seems complex, but maybe I can find a way to select S such that the negative impact of the a_i for the top k b_i is minimized.

Wait, perhaps I can consider selecting items based on some combined score.

Let me consider defining a new value for each item: c_i = b_i - a_i.

Then, profit = sum( c_i for S \ T ) - sum( a_i for T ).

But this doesn't directly help.

Wait, perhaps I can think differently.

Suppose Alice selects a subset S.

Bob takes the k items with highest b_i in S for free.

Alice's profit is sum( b_i for S \ T ) - sum( a_i for S ).

Which is sum( b_i for S ) - sum( b_i for T ) - sum( a_i for S ).

Which is sum( b_i - a_i for S ) - sum( b_i for T ).

Alice wants to maximize this.

Bob wants to minimize sum( b_i for T ), but since he chooses T to minimize Alice's profit, he will choose T to maximize sum( b_i for T ).

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Actually, since Bob is choosing T to minimize Alice's profit, he wants to maximize sum( b_i for T ).

Because the larger sum( b_i for T ), the smaller Alice's profit.

Therefore, Bob will choose T as the k items in S with the highest b_i.

So, Alice needs to select S such that sum( b_i - a_i for S ) - sum( b_i for T ) is maximized.

This can be rewritten as sum( -a_i for S ) + sum( b_i for S \ T ).

This is still confusing.

Maybe I need to consider that for each possible subset S, the profit is sum( b_i - a_i for S ) - sum( b_i for T ), where T is the k items in S with highest b_i.

I need to maximize this over S.

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Perhaps I can consider different approaches.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to buy items and sell some of them to Bob, while Bob takes k items for free.

I need to maximize the profit, which is the revenue from Bob minus the cost of buying the items.

Given that Bob can choose which k items to take for free, Alice needs to anticipate that and choose items accordingly.

Maybe I can model this as selecting a subset S, sorting it by b_i, taking the top k b_i items for free, and summing b_i - a_i for the remaining items.

Wait, but Bob takes the k items with highest b_i for free, so Alice's profit is sum( b_i - a_i for S \ T ) - sum( a_i for T ).

Which is sum( b_i - a_i for S \ T ) - sum( a_i for T ).

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Perhaps I can consider the following approach:

- Sort all items in decreasing order of b_i.

- Then, consider selecting the first m items, where m >= k.

- Bob will take the first k items for free.

- Alice's profit would be sum( b_i - a_i for items k+1 to m ) - sum( a_i for items 1 to k ).

- Alice can choose m to maximize this profit.

But this seems limited because Alice can choose any subset S, not just consecutive in the sorted order.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Alice can select any subset S, and Bob will take the top k b_i items in S for free.

So, perhaps I need to consider adding items to S based on their contribution to the profit.

Let me consider defining for each item i:

If Alice includes item i in S:

- If i is among the top k b_i in S, then Bob takes it for free, and Alice loses a_i.

- If i is not among the top k b_i in S, then Alice gets b_i - a_i.

This seems like a complex dependency between items.

Maybe I can model this as a maximum weight subset selection with a constraint on the k highest weights.

This sounds similar to maximizing a set function with a constraint on the subset.

This might be too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the following idea:

Suppose I fix a threshold t, and consider only items with b_i <= t.

Then, Bob will take the k items with highest b_i in S, which are all <= t, so he takes the k items with highest b_i, all <= t.

Alice's profit is sum( b_i - a_i for S \ T ) - sum( a_i for T ).

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for items with b_i > t, including them in S would cause Bob to take them for free, since they have high b_i.

But if I set t such that items with b_i > t are not included in S, then Bob takes the top k b_i items in S, which are all <= t.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal b_i among the top k items in S.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the k-th highest b_i in S.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort all items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, for any subset S, the top k b_i items in S are the first k items in this sorted list that are in S.

Wait, but this might not be accurate because the top k in S depend on which items are in S.

This seems too interdependent.

Maybe I need to consider the items in terms of their potential contribution to the profit.

Let me consider defining for each item i:

If Alice includes i in S and i is not among the top k b_i in S, then her profit increases by b_i - a_i.

If i is among the top k b_i in S, then Bob takes it for free, and Alice's profit decreases by a_i.

But this is similar to what I thought earlier.

This seems too convoluted for direct implementation.

Perhaps I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice can select a subset S, and Bob will take the k items with highest b_i in S for free.

So, Alice's profit is sum( b_i - a_i for S ) - 2 * sum( b_i for T ), where T is the k items with highest b_i in S.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's see.

Alice's profit is sum( b_i for S \ T ) - sum( a_i for S ).

Which is sum( b_i for S ) - sum( b_i for T ) - sum( a_i for S ).

Which is sum( b_i - a_i for S ) - sum( b_i for T ).

I need to maximize this.

This can be rewritten as sum( b_i - a_i for S \ T ) - sum( a_i for T ).

Still complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that for items in S \ T, their contribution is b_i - a_i, and for items in T, their contribution is -a_i.

But T is the k items in S with highest b_i.

This seems like a submodular function or something similar, but that might be too slow for the constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort all items in decreasing order of b_i.

- Then, consider selecting the first m items, where m >= k.

- Bob will take the first k items for free.

- Alice's profit is sum( b_i - a_i for items k+1 to m ) - sum( a_i for items 1 to k ).

- Alice can choose m to maximize this profit.

Wait, but this only considers selecting the top m items in terms of b_i, but maybe Alice should select items with high b_i - a_i, but it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for items with b_i - a_i > 0, Alice wants to include them, but if b_i is very high, Bob might take them for free, costing Alice a_i.

This is confusing.

Maybe I need to consider items where b_i - a_i > a_i, meaning that even if Bob takes them for free, Alice still makes some profit.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about small examples to see a pattern.

Take the first example in the problem:

n=2, k=0

a=[2,1], b=[1,2]

If k=0, Bob takes no items for free.

So, Alice can choose to buy both items.

Bob pays b_i for both items.

Profit: b1 + b2 - a1 - a2 = 1 + 2 - 2 - 1 = 0.

But according to the explanation, Alice should buy the second item only, profit=2-1=1.

Wait, in this case, since k=0, Bob pays for all items Alice buys.

So, if Alice buys only the second item, profit=2-1=1.

If she buys both, profit=1+2-2-1=0.

So, indeed, choosing to buy only the second item is better.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, for k=0, Alice should select all items where b_i - a_i > 0.

In this case, item 1: 1-2=-1 <0, so don't buy it.

Item 2: 2-1=1 >0, so buy it.

Profit=1.

That matches the first example.

So, for k=0, it's straightforward: select items where b_i - a_i >0, and sum(b_i - a_i for these items).

But for k>=1, it's more complicated.

Let me look at the second example:

n=4, k=1

a=[1,2,1,4], b=[3,3,2,3]

According to the explanation, Alice buys items 1,2,3 (indices 0,1,2).

Bob takes the item with highest b_i, which is item 1 or item 3, both have b_i=3.

Suppose Bob takes item 1 for free.

Then, Alice sells items 0 and 2 to Bob: b0 + b2 = 3 + 2 =5.

Alice's total cost: a0 + a1 + a2 =1 +2 +1=4.

Profit:5 -4=1.

Alternatively, if Bob takes item 3 for free, which also has
