Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these n constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the answer is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input format. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, there's a number n indicating the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing two integers a and x, where a specifies the type of constraint.

My task is to process these constraints and count the number of integers k that satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to collect all the constraints of each type.

- For type 1 (k >= x), I need to find the maximum among these x's because k needs to be greater than or equal to all of them. So, the lower bound for k is the maximum of all type 1 x's.

- For type 2 (k <= x), I need to find the minimum among these x's because k needs to be less than or equal to all of them. So, the upper bound for k is the minimum of all type 2 x's.

- For type 3 (k != x), I need to exclude these specific values of x from the range defined by the lower and upper bounds.

Given that, the possible values of k lie between the lower bound and the upper bound, inclusive, excluding the values specified in type 3 constraints.

So, the number of possible k's is the number of integers from the lower bound to the upper bound, inclusive, minus the number of type 3 x's that fall within this range.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the type 3 constraints are within the range because if x is outside the range defined by type 1 and type 2 constraints, it's already excluded, so I don't need to subtract it.

Hence, I need to calculate the number of integers between the lower and upper bounds, inclusive, and then subtract the number of type 3 x's that are within this range.

But, I need to make sure that the type 3 x's are unique and within the range.

Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one type 1 and one type 2 constraint, and that no two constraints are the same.

Let me consider an example to verify my approach.

Take the first example from the input:

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, n=4.

Type 1: k >= 3

Type 2: k <= 10

Type 3: k != 1 and k != 5

So, the range of k is from 3 to 10, inclusive.

Possible k's: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

But k != 1 (which is already outside the range), and k !=5.

So, exclude 5 from the range.

Hence, possible k's: 3,4,6,7,8,9,10 â†’ 7 values.

Which matches the first output.

Another example:

2

1 5

2 4

Here, lower bound is 5, upper bound is 4.

But 5 > 4, so no k satisfies this.

Hence, output is 0.

Good.

Another example:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

So, type 1 constraints: k >= 7 (since max of 2,7,3 is 7)

Type 2 constraints: k <= 98 (min of 100 and 98)

Type 3 constraints: 6,7,100,44,99

So, range is from 7 to 98.

Exclude k=7,44,99 (since 6 and 100 are outside the range).

So, possible k's: from 7 to 98, inclusive, minus k=7 and k=44.

Total k's: 98 - 7 + 1 = 92

Subtract 2 (for k=7 and k=44), so 90.

Matches the third output.

Good.

So, my approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

loop = int(input())

for iterable in range(loop):

less = []

big = []

no = []

num = 0

innerLoop = int(input())

for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):

(x, a) = map(int, input().split())

if x == 1:

big.append(a)

elif x == 2:

less.append(a)

else:

no.append(a)

for i in range(max(big), min(less)):

if i not in no:

num = i

break

print(num)

Wait a minute.

This program seems to have a mistake.

In the last loop:

for i in range(max(big), min(less)):

if i not in no:

num = i

break

print(num)

This is setting num to the first k that satisfies all constraints, but the problem asks for the number of such k's, not just one of them.

Moreover, the range in Python is from max(big) up to but not including min(less), so it should be range(max(big), min(less)+1) to include min(less).

Also, it's storing the first k that satisfies the constraints in num and printing it, which is incorrect because we need the count, not the value.

So, this program is wrong.

Wait, but perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Let me check the example again.

In the first test case, the correct answer is 7, which is the count of k's, not a specific k.

But in the program, it's printing num, which seems to be set to the first k that satisfies the constraints.

This is not what's required.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Moreover, in the second test case, it should print 0, but according to this program, it would loop from 5 to 4, which is empty, so num remains 0, which coincidentally matches the correct answer, but for the wrong reason.

In the third test case, it would set num to 90, which matches the correct answer, but again, by coincidence.

Wait, in the third test case, the correct answer is 90, which is the count of k's, but in the program, num is set to the first k that satisfies the constraints, which is 7, but it's printing 90.

Wait, no, in the program, it's printing num, which is set inside the loop.

But in the third test case, it's printing 90, which is the correct count, but the program seems to be setting num to the first k that satisfies the constraints, not counting them.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the program.

Looking back, in the program:

for i in range(max(big), min(less)):

if i not in no:

num = i

break

print(num)

This sets num to the first k that satisfies all constraints and prints it.

But in the sample output, for the third test case, it's 90, which is the count.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 90, which matches the correct count.

But according to the program, it would set num to 7, since 7 is the first k that satisfies the constraints, but 7 is not equal to 90.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the program.

Wait, perhaps the variable num is intended to count the number of k's, but in the program, it's being used to store the value of k, not the count.

This is confusing.

Wait, looking again:

num = 0

for i in range(max(big), min(less)):

if i not in no:

num = i

break

print(num)

This sets num to the first k that satisfies the constraints and prints it.

But the problem requires the number of such k's, not the value of k.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

In the first test case, it would set num to 3 and print 3, but the correct answer is 7.

In the second test case, it would set num to 0 (since the loop doesn't run) and print 0, which coincides with the correct answer, but for the wrong reason.

In the third test case, it would set num to 7 and print 7, but the correct answer is 90.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
