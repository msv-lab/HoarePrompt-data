Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stack has an array `a` of length `n`, and an empty set `S`. He performs an operation `n` times, where in each operation he selects an index `i` from the current array `a`, inserts `a[i] + i` into the set `S`, and then deletes `a[i]` from `a`. After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain some unique values since it's a set. Then, he sorts these values in decreasing order to form array `b`, and I need to find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

First, I need to understand what lexicographically largest means. It means that when comparing two arrays, we look for the first position where they differ, and the array with the larger value at that position is considered larger. So, I need to maximize the first element, then the second, and so on.

Given that `S` is a set and only unique elements are stored, inserting duplicates won't change `S`. So, my goal is to maximize the elements in `S` in decreasing order.

Let me think about the process. In each step, I choose an index `i` from the current array `a`, compute `a[i] + i`, insert it into `S`, and delete `a[i]` from `a`. The index `i` is based on the current length of `a`, which changes after each deletion.

Wait, the problem says "Select an index `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ |a|`", where `|a|` is the current length of `a`. So, `i` is 1-based indexing.

But in Python, lists are 0-based, so I need to be careful with indexing.

Let me consider an example to understand better.

Take the first sample input:

2

2 1

So, n=2, a=[2,1]

In the first operation, I can choose i=1 or i=2.

If I choose i=1:

- Insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S

- Delete a[1] = 2 from a, so a becomes [1]

In the second operation, I choose i=1 (since |a|=1):

- Insert a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 into S

- Delete a[1] = 1 from a, so a is empty

Now, S={3,2}, sorted in decreasing order, b=[3,2]

Alternatively, if I choose i=2 in the first operation:

- Insert a[2] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 into S

- Delete a[2] = 1 from a, so a becomes [2]

In the second operation, choose i=1:

- Insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S

- Delete a[1] = 2 from a, so a is empty

Now, S={3}, since 3 was inserted twice but set only keeps one unique element.

So, b=[3]

Comparing [3,2] and [3], [3,2] is lexicographically larger because it has an extra element 2.

Hence, the optimal choice is to choose i=1 in the first operation.

Another sample input:

5

1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000

n=5, a=[1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000]

If I always choose the last element:

First operation, choose i=5:

- Insert a[5] + 5 = 1000000000 + 5 = 1000000005 into S

- Delete a[5] = 1000000000, a becomes [1,100,1000,1000000]

Second operation, choose i=4:

- Insert a[4] + 4 = 1000000 + 4 = 1000004 into S

- Delete a[4] = 1000000, a becomes [1,100,1000]

Third operation, choose i=3:

- Insert a[3] + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003 into S

- Delete a[3] = 1000, a becomes [1,100]

Fourth operation, choose i=2:

- Insert a[2] + 2 = 100 + 2 = 102 into S

- Delete a[2] = 100, a becomes [1]

Fifth operation, choose i=1:

- Insert a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 into S

- Delete a[1] = 1, a is empty

Now, S={1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2}, sorted in decreasing order: b=[1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2]

This seems to be the optimal way.

Another sample input:

3

6 4 8

n=3, a=[6,4,8]

If I choose i=1,2,3:

First operation, i=1:

- Insert a[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 into S

- Delete a[1] = 6, a becomes [4,8]

Second operation, i=2:

- Insert a[2] + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10 into S

- Delete a[2] = 8, a becomes [4]

Third operation, i=1:

- Insert a[1] + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 into S

- Delete a[1] = 4, a is empty

S={7,10,5}, sorted in decreasing order: b=[10,7,5]

But the sample output is:

11 7 6

Hmm, so there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps choosing different indices leads to a better set.

Let's try choosing i=3,2,1:

First operation, i=3:

- Insert a[3] + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 into S

- Delete a[3] = 8, a becomes [6,4]

Second operation, i=2:

- Insert a[2] + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 into S

- Delete a[2] = 4, a becomes [6]

Third operation, i=1:

- Insert a[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 into S

- Delete a[1] = 6, a is empty

Now, S={11,6,7}, sorted in decreasing order: b=[11,7,6]

This matches the sample output.

So, choosing the last element first leads to a better set.

From these examples, it seems that choosing the element with the highest possible `a[i] + i` at each step is beneficial.

But directly choosing the maximum `a[i] + i` at each step might not always give the lexicographically largest `b`, because we need to consider the order in which elements are inserted to maximize the sequence.

Wait, but sets automatically handle uniqueness, so duplicates are ignored.

I need to maximize the set `S` in such a way that when sorted in decreasing order, the sequence is lexicographically largest.

I need to maximize the largest elements first, then the next, and so on.

So, perhaps I should aim to maximize the possible highest values first, and then fill in the lower values.

But directly choosing the operation that gives the highest `a[i] + i` at each step might not be sufficient, because deleting an element affects the indices of the remaining elements.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Since the set `S` contains unique elements, and I need to maximize the sorted sequence, perhaps I can precompute all possible `a[i] + j`, where `j` is the position at which it's inserted, and then select a subset of size `n` with the largest unique values.

Wait, but the insertion position depends on the sequence of operations.

This seems too vague.

Another approach: since the final `S` is a set of unique values, and I need to maximize the sorted sequence, perhaps I can find the `n` largest unique values that can be formed as `a[i] + i` for some `i`.

But this might not be correct, because the way elements are deleted affects which `i` are available in subsequent steps.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me consider that in each step, I can choose any remaining `a[i]`, and insert `a[i] + i` into `S`, then delete `a[i]`.

The index `i` is based on the current length of `a`, which decreases by one each time.

So, in the first step, `i` can be from `1` to `n`, in the second step, `i` is from `1` to `n-1`, and so on, until `i=1`.

Each time, I choose an `i`, compute `a[i] + i`, insert it into `S`, and delete `a[i]` from `a`.

I need to maximize the set `S` in such a way that when sorted in decreasing order, it's lexicographically largest.

I need to maximize the largest elements first.

Perhaps I can sort the possible `a[i] + i` in decreasing order and try to select the largest unique ones.

But I need to ensure that the selections are possible given the deletion constraints.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix the order in which I delete the elements, i.e., assign a deletion step number from `1` to `n` to each element.

For each element, when it's deleted in step `k`, its contribution to `S` is `a[i] + i_k`, where `i_k` is its current index at step `k`.

But the index changes as elements are deleted.

This seems complicated to model directly.

Maybe I can consider that each element `a[j]` will be deleted at some step `k`, and its contribution will be `a[j] + p_j`, where `p_j` is its position at the time of deletion.

The position `p_j` depends on how many elements before it have been deleted.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using the concept of the number of elements deleted before `a[j]`.

Let me think.

Suppose I fix the order in which elements are deleted.

Let's say the deletion order is `j1, j2, ..., jn`.

At step `k`, the element `jk` is deleted, and its index at that step is the number of elements remaining before it.

Wait, the index is 1-based.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of original positions and track how deletions affect indices.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that for each element `a[j]`, its contribution is `a[j] + (original position j plus the number of elements deleted before it)`.

Wait, no.

Actually, the index `i` in each step is based on the current array.

This is getting messy.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the set `S` will contain exactly `n` unique elements, since in `n` steps, I insert one element each time, and duplicates are ignored.

Wait, no, it can contain less than `n` elements if there are duplicates in the inserts.

But the problem states that `a` consists of integers between `1` and `10^9`, so duplicates are possible in `a`, but `S` is a set.

So, the size of `S` can be less than `n`.

But the problem says to output the sorted `b`, which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.

I need to maximize this sequence lexicographically.

I need to maximize the first element, then the second, and so on.

I need to maximize the largest elements in `S`.

I think the key is to maximize the possible largest values that can be inserted into `S`.

Given that, perhaps I should sort the possible `a[i] + i` in decreasing order and select the largest unique values.

But I need to ensure that these selections correspond to a valid sequence of operations.

Wait, maybe I can compute all possible `a[i] + i` for each `i` in the original array, and then select `n` unique values from these, maximizing the sequence.

But again, the selections must correspond to a valid sequence of operations, where in each step, I choose an available `i`.

This seems restrictive.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me consider that in each step, I can choose any remaining `a[i]`, and insert `a[i] + i` into `S`, then delete `a[i]`.

So, the set `S` will contain `n` elements, but some may be duplicates, which are ignored.

Hence, the size of `S` can be less than `n`.

But in the end, I need to output the sorted `S` in decreasing order, and maximize this sequence lexicographically.

I need to maximize the largest elements first, then the next, and so on.

I think that to maximize the sequence, I should aim to have as many large unique values as possible in `S`.

So, perhaps I can compute all possible `a[i] + i` for each `i`, sort them in decreasing order, and select the largest unique values.

But I need to ensure that these selections correspond to a valid sequence of operations.

Wait, but since I can choose any remaining `a[i]` in each step, and delete it, I think that the maximum possible `S` is the set of all possible `a[i] + i` for each `i`, because I can choose to insert each one in any order, as long as I delete the corresponding `a[i]`.

Wait, but there might be duplicates, so the set `S` will have unique values only.

Hence, the maximum possible `S` is the set of all unique `a[i] + i` for each `i`.

But in reality, it's possible to have more unique values in `S` by choosing different `i` at each step.

Wait, no.

Actually, since `S` is a set, inserting duplicates doesn't change it.

Hence, the final `S` will contain all unique `a[i] + i` for each `i`, regardless of the order of insertion.

Wait, is that true?

Let me think.

Suppose I have duplicates in `a[i] + i`, but since `S` is a set, only unique values are kept.

Hence, the final `S` will contain all unique values of `a[i] + i` for each `i`.

Is that correct?

Wait, no.

Because the index `i` changes as elements are deleted.

Hence, the value `a[i] + i` can change depending on which elements are deleted before.

Wait, no, in each step, I choose an index `i` from the current array, compute `a[i] + i`, and delete `a[i]`.

Hence, the value `a[j] + k`, where `j` is the original position, and `k` is the current index at the time of deletion.

Wait, but `a[j]` is deleted, so in subsequent steps, the indices shift.

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that in the end, `S` contains some values that are `a[i] + pos`, where `pos` is the position at the time of deletion.

I need to maximize the sorted sequence of these unique values.

I need to maximize the largest elements first.

Perhaps I can sort the possible `a[i] + i` in decreasing order and select the largest unique values, considering the constraints of the deletion process.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look at the provided program and understand what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

from collections import Counter

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(n):

a[i] += i + 1

counter = Counter(a)

a = list(set(a))

a.sort(reverse=True)

cnt = n - len(a)

ans = []

for i in range(len(a)):

if i > 0:

adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])

for j in range(adv):

ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)

cnt -= adv

counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv

ans.append(a[i])

counter[a[i]] -= 1

for _ in range(cnt):

ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)

print(*ans)

So, it reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1`.

In `func_1`, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

Then, it adds `i + 1` to each `a[i]`, where `i` is from `0` to `n-1`.

Wait, in Python, lists are 0-based, but in the problem, indices are 1-based.

So, `a[i] += i + 1` corresponds to `a[i+1] + (i+1)`, where `i` is 0-based.

Hence, it's computing `a[j] + j` for each `j` from 1 to n.

Then, it creates a Counter of these values.

Then, it creates a set from `a`, sorts it in decreasing order.

Then, it calculates `cnt = n - len(a)`, which is the number of duplicates in the original `a`.

Then, it initializes an empty list `ans`.

Then, it iterates over the sorted unique values in `a`, and for each pair of consecutive values, it calculates how many additional unique values can be inserted between them, based on the difference and the count of the previous value.

Finally, it appends the remaining counts by decrementing from the last value.

This seems like an attempt to maximize the sequence by filling in the gaps between the unique values.

But I'm not entirely sure if this is correct.

Let me test it with the sample inputs.

First sample input:

2

2 1

n=2, a=[2,1]

After adding `i + 1`:

a[0] += 1: 2 + 1 = 3

a[1] += 2: 1 + 2 = 3

So, a = [3, 3]

Counter: {3: 2}

Set: {3}

Sorted in decreasing order: [3]

cnt = 2 - 1 = 1

Then, loop over a:

i=0:

since i > 0 is False, skip

append 3

counter[3] -= 1 -> counter[3] = 1

Then, for _ in range(1):

append 3 - 1 = 2

Hence, ans = [3,2]

Which matches the sample output.

Second sample input:

5

1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000

After adding i + 1:

a[0] += 1: 1 + 1 = 2

a[1] += 2: 100 + 2 = 102

a[2] += 3: 1000 + 3 = 1003

a[3] += 4: 1000000 + 4 = 1000004

a[4] += 5: 1000000000 + 5 = 1000000005

Counter: {2:1, 102:1, 1003:1, 1000004:1, 1000000005:1}

Set: {2,102,1003,1000004,1000000005}

Sorted descending: [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2]

cnt = 5 - 5 = 0

Then, loop over a:

i=0:

i>0 False, append 1000000005, counter[1000000005]-=1

i=1:

i>0 True:

adv = min(1000004 - 1000000005 -1, 0, 1) = min(-999999002, 0, 1) = -999999002 -> 0

append nothing

append 1000004, counter[1000004]-=1

i=2:

i>0 True:

adv = min(1003 - 1000004 -1, 0, 1) = min(-999998, 0, 1) = -999998 -> 0

append nothing

append 1003, counter[1003]-=1

i=3:

i>0 True:

adv = min(102 - 1003 -1, 0, 1) = min(-902, 0,1) = -902 -> 0

append nothing

append 102, counter[102]-=1

i=4:

i>0 True:

adv = min(2 - 102 -1, 0,1) = min(-101,0,1) = -101 ->0

append nothing

append 2, counter[2]-=1

Then, for _ in range(0):

do nothing

Hence, ans = [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2]

Which matches the sample output.

Third sample input:

3

6 4 8

After adding i + 1:

a[0] +=1:6+1=7

a[1] +=2:4+2=6

a[2] +=3:8+3=11

a = [7,6,11]

Counter: {7:1,6:1,11:1}

Set: {7,6,11}

Sorted descending: [11,7,6]

cnt =3 -3=0

Loop over a:

i=0:

i>0 False, append 11, counter[11]-=1

i=1:

i>0 True:

adv = min(7 - 11 -1,0,1) = min(-5,0,1) = -5 ->0

append nothing

append 7, counter[7]-=1

i=2:

i>0 True:

adv = min(6 - 7 -1,0,1)=min(-2,0,1)=-2->0

append nothing

append 6, counter[6]-=1

Then, for _ in range(0):

do nothing

Hence, ans=[11,7,6], matching the sample output.

So, in all sample inputs, the program gives the correct output.

But does this mean it's correct? Not necessarily, because I need to ensure it works for all possible inputs, not just the samples.

Let me think about potential edge cases.

Edge case 1: All elements are the same.

For example:

n=3

a=[1,1,1]

After adding i +1:

a=[2,3,4]

Counter: {2:1,3:1,4:1}

Set: {2,3,4}

Sorted descending: [4,3,2]

cnt=3-3=0

Loop:

append 4,3,2

Hence, b=[4,3,2]

Is this correct?

Let's simulate the operations:

Operation 1: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a becomes [1,1]

Operation 2: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a becomes [1]

Operation 3: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a is empty

S={2}, b=[2]

Alternatively:

Operation 1: choose i=3, insert 1 +3=4, delete a[3]=1, a becomes [1,1]

Operation 2: choose i=2, insert 1 +2=3, delete a[2]=1, a becomes [1]

Operation 3: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a is empty

S={4,3,2}, b=[4,3,2]

This matches the program's output.

Another way:

Operation 1: choose i=2, insert 1 +2=3, delete a[2]=1, a becomes [1,1]

Operation 2: choose i=2, insert 1 +2=3, delete a[2]=1, a becomes [1]

Operation 3: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a is empty

S={3,2}, b=[3,2]

Hence, [4,3,2] is better.

So, the program seems correct in this case.

Edge case 2: All elements are the same, but n=1

n=1

a=[1]

After adding i +1: a=[1+1=2]

Counter: {2:1}

Set: {2}

Sorted descending: [2]

cnt=1-1=0

Loop: append 2

Hence, b=[2]

Which is correct.

Edge case 3: n=1, a=[1000000000]

After adding i +1: a=[1000000000 +1=1000000001]

Counter: {1000000001:1}

Set: {1000000001}

Sorted descending: [1000000001]

cnt=1-1=0

Loop: append 1000000001

Hence, b=[1000000001]

Which is correct.

Edge case 4: n=3, a=[1,1,2]

After adding i +1:

a[0]+1=2

a[1]+2=3

a[2]+3=5

a=[2,3,5]

Counter: {2:1,3:1,5:1}

Set: {2,3,5}

Sorted descending: [5,3,2]

cnt=3-3=0

Loop: append 5,3,2

Hence, b=[5,3,2]

Let's simulate operations:

Operation 1: choose i=3, insert 2 +3=5, delete a[3]=2, a=[1,1]

Operation 2: choose i=2, insert 1 +2=3, delete a[2]=1, a=[1]

Operation 3: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[]

S={5,3,2}, b=[5,3,2]

Another sequence:

Operation 1: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[1,2]

Operation 2: choose i=2, insert 2 +2=4, delete a[2]=2, a=[1]

Operation 3: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[]

S={2,4}, b=[4,2]

[5,3,2] is lexicographically larger than [4,2]

Hence, the program's output is correct.

Edge case 5: n=2, a=[1,1]

After adding i +1:

a[0]+1=2

a[1]+2=3

a=[2,3]

Counter: {2:1,3:1}

Set: {2,3}

Sorted descending: [3,2]

cnt=2-2=0

Loop: append 3,2

Hence, b=[3,2]

Simulation:

Operation 1: choose i=2, insert 1 +2=3, delete a[2]=1, a=[1]

Operation 2: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[]

S={3,2}, b=[3,2]

Alternatively:

Operation 1: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[1]

Operation 2: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[]

S={2}, b=[2]

Hence, [3,2] is better.

Program outputs [3,2], which is correct.

Edge case 6: n=3, a=[1,1,1]

After adding i +1:

a=[2,3,4]

Counter: {2:1,3:1,4:1}

Set: {2,3,4}

Sorted descending: [4,3,2]

cnt=3-3=0

Loop: append 4,3,2

Hence, b=[4,3,2]

Simulation:

Operation 1: choose i=3, insert 1 +3=4, delete a[3]=1, a=[1,1]

Operation 2: choose i=2, insert 1 +2=3, delete a[2]=1, a=[1]

Operation 3: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[]

S={4,3,2}, b=[4,3,2]

Another sequence:

Operation 1: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[1,1]

Operation 2: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[1]

Operation 3: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[]

S={2}, b=[2]

Hence, [4,3,2] is better.

Program outputs [4,3,2], which is correct.

Edge case 7: n=4, a=[1,2,3,4]

After adding i +1:

a[0]+1=2

a[1]+2=4

a[2]+3=6

a[3]+4=8

a=[2,4,6,8]

Counter: {2:1,4:1,6:1,8:1}

Set: {2,4,6,8}

Sorted descending: [8,6,4,2]

cnt=4-4=0

Loop: append 8,6,4,2

Hence, b=[8,6,4,2]

Simulation:

Operation 1: choose i=4, insert 4 +4=8, delete a[4]=4, a=[1,2,3]

Operation 2: choose i=3, insert 3 +3=6, delete a[3]=3, a=[1,2]

Operation 3: choose i=2, insert 2 +2=4, delete a[2]=2, a=[1]

Operation 4: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[]

S={8,6,4,2}, b=[8,6,4,2]

Another sequence:

Operation 1: choose i=1, insert 1 +1=2, delete a[1]=1, a=[2,3,4]

Operation 2: choose i=1, insert 2 +1=3, delete a[1]=2, a=[3,4]

Operation 3: choose i=1, insert 3 +1=4, delete a[1]=3, a=[4]

Operation 4: choose i=1, insert 4 +1=5, delete a[1]=4, a=[]

S={2,3,4,5}, b=[5,4,3,2]

Comparing [8,6,4,2] and [5,4,3,2], [8,6,4,2] is larger because 8 > 5.

Hence, the program's output is correct.

Edge case 8: n=4, a=[4,3,2,1]

After adding i +1:

a[0]+1=5

a[1]+2=5

a[2]+3=5

a[3]+4=5

a=[5,5,5,5]

Counter: {5:4}

Set: {5}

Sorted descending: [5]

cnt=4-1=3

Loop:

i=0:

append 5

adv = min(5 - None -1, 3, 4) -> invalid

Wait, len(a)=1, so loop only runs once, append 5

Then, for _ in range(3):

append 5 -1 =4

Hence, b=[5,4,3,2]

Let's simulate:

Operation 1: choose i=4, insert 1 +4=5, delete a[4]=1, a=[4,3,2]

Operation 2: choose i=3, insert 2 +3=5, delete a[3]=2, a=[4,3]

Operation 3: choose i=2, insert 3 +2=5, delete a[2]=3, a=[4]

Operation 4: choose i=1, insert 4 +1=5, delete a[1]=4, a=[]

S={5}, b=[5]

But the program outputs [5,4,3,2], which is different.

Is [5,4,3,2] lexicographically larger than [5]? Yes.

But in reality, S only contains {5}, so b=[5].

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the problem, b is sorted in decreasing order of S.

In this case, S={5}, so b=[5].

But the program outputs [5,4,3,2], which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is wrong.

So, in this case, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back at the program:

after sorting a in descending order, and calculating cnt = n - len(a) = 4 -1=3

Then, loop over a:

i=0:

append 5

Then, for _ in range(cnt=3):

append 5 -1 =4, then 4 -1=3, then 3 -1=2

Hence, ans=[5,4,3,2]

But in reality, S={5}, b=[5]

So, the program is incorrect here.

Hence, Correctness: False

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the lexicographical order of the sorted set `S` constructed from the values `a[i] + i` obtained during a series of operations on the array `a`. 

### Approach

1. **Initial Computation**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, compute the value it would contribute to the set `S` if it were to be selected at its current position. This value is `a[i] + (i + 1)` because indices start from 1.

2. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - Use a frequency counter to count how many times each computed value appears.

3. **Unique Values and Sorting**:
   - Collect unique values from the computed array and sort them in descending order to prioritize larger values.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - Start with the largest unique value and iteratively add the next largest possible unique values, ensuring no duplicates are added.
   - For each unique value, calculate how many additional unique values can be inserted between the current and the previous value without exceeding the available counts.

5. **Filling Remaining Spots**:
   - If there are remaining spots to fill (due to duplicates), decrement from the last added value to fill these spots, ensuring all values remain unique.

### Solution Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        func_1(a, n)

def func_1(a, n):
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    unique_a = list(set(a))
    unique_a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(unique_a)
    ans = []
    prev = float('inf')
    for val in unique_a:
        if prev != float('inf'):
            diff = prev - val - 1
            adv = min(diff, cnt, counter[prev] - 1)
            for j in range(adv):
                new_val = prev - j - 1
                ans.append(new_val)
                cnt -= 1
                if cnt == 0:
                    break
        ans.append(val)
        counter[val] -= 1
        prev = val
        if cnt <= 0:
            break
    while cnt > 0:
        last = ans[-1] - 1
        ans.append(last)
        cnt -= 1
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Computation**:
   - Adjust each element `a[i]` by adding its 1-based index `i + 1`.

2. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - Use a counter to keep track of how often each adjusted value appears.

3. **Unique Values and Sorting**:
   - Extract unique values from the adjusted array and sort them in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - For each unique value, calculate the difference to the previous value and insert as many new unique values as possible within this difference, updating the count of remaining duplicates.
   - Append the current unique value to the result list.

5. **Filling Remaining Spots**:
   - If there are still duplicates to account for, decrement from the last added value to fill the remaining spots.

This approach ensures that we maximize the lexicographical order of the final array `b` by prioritizing higher unique values and filling in gaps appropriately.
