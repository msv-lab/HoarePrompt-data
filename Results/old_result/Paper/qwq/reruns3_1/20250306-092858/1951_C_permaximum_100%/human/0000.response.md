Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I want to reward my employees with tickets to a concert. There are n days when tickets are on sale, and I've somehow predicted the price per ticket for each day. There are a couple of constraints: I can't buy more than m tickets per day, and every time I buy x tickets on a day, the price per ticket increases by x for all subsequent days. My goal is to buy exactly k tickets at the minimum total cost.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have n days, each with a price per ticket, a_i. Each day, I can buy up to m tickets, but if I buy x tickets on day i, then for all days j > i, the price per ticket increases by x.

So, for example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5], and I buy 2 tickets on day 1, the cost is 2 * 1 = 2, and the prices for days 2 to 5 become [1+2, 3+2, 8+2, 4+2] = [3, 5, 10, 6]. If then I buy 3 tickets on day 2, the cost is 3 * 5 = 15, and the prices for days 3 to 5 become [10+3, 6+3] = [13, 9]. And so on.

I need to buy exactly k tickets, possibly spread over multiple days, respecting the daily limit m, and minimizing the total cost.

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem. I need to decide how many tickets to buy on which days to minimize the total cost, considering that buying tickets on one day affects the prices on subsequent days.

Let me think about the constraints:

- n can be up to 3*10^5, which is 300,000 days.

- m can be up to 10^9, which is a billion tickets per day.

- k can be up to min(n*m, 10^9), which is up to a billion tickets.

- The sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5.

Given these constraints, any solution that is O(n^2) or even O(n log n) per test case might be too slow because t can be up to 10^4 and n up to 3*10^5, but the total sum of n is limited to 3*10^5, so overall time complexity should be O(sum_n log sum_n), which should be manageable.

I need to find a way to select days and the number of tickets to buy on those days to minimize the total cost.

Let me consider the effect of buying tickets on a particular day. If I buy x tickets on day i, the cost is x * (a_i + increase), where increase is the sum of all x's from previous days on which I bought tickets.

Moreover, after buying x tickets on day i, the prices for all subsequent days increase by x.

So, the order in which I buy tickets matters because buying on one day affects future prices.

I need to find an order of buying tickets that minimizes the total cost.

One approach that comes to mind is to always buy tickets on the day with the currently lowest price per ticket, considering the increased prices due to previous purchases.

This sounds like a greedy approach: always pick the day with the smallest current price to buy as many tickets as possible.

Let me think about that.

Suppose I have a priority queue (min-heap) of days, ordered by their current price.

I start with all days in the queue, with their initial prices.

I keep buying tickets on the day with the smallest current price, up to m tickets or until I've bought enough tickets.

Every time I buy x tickets on a day, I remove that day from the queue (since I can't buy more on that day), and I increase the prices of all remaining days in the queue by x.

Wait, but removing and updating the prices of all remaining days could be inefficient if done naively.

Given the constraints, with n up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but sum_n up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets I buy on each day, say b_i tickets on day i, with 0 <= b_i <= m, and sum(b_i) = k.

The total cost would be sum over i from 1 to n of b_i * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of b_j).

This can be rewritten as sum over i of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j).

This seems a bit messy.

Alternatively, let me rearrange the terms.

Total cost = sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i of b_i * sum over j < i of b_j.

Wait, that's the same as sum over i of b_i * a_i + sum over i < j of b_i * b_j.

This still seems complicated.

Maybe there's another way to look at it.

Let me consider that the price increase is cumulative based on the total tickets bought on previous days.

So, the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of b_j for j < i.

Thus, the total cost is sum over i of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j).

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Perhaps I should consider the marginal cost of buying a ticket on a particular day.

The marginal cost of buying one ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of b_j for j < i, and plus the increase in price for all subsequent days, which is the number of tickets bought on those days.

Wait, that seems too vague.

Let me try to think of it in terms of the total increase.

Every ticket I buy on day i increases the price for all subsequent days by 1.

So, the total cost can be thought of as sum over i of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j) + sum over j > i of b_j.

Wait, not sure.

Let me see.

Actually, when I buy a ticket on day i, it increases the price for all subsequent days by 1 for each ticket bought on day i.

So, the total increase for day j > i is sum over m < j of b_m.

But I'm getting tangled here.

Maybe I need to find a way to calculate the total cost by considering the contribution of each ticket to the total cost based on when it's bought.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this problem using priority queues or some sort of dynamic programming.

Given the constraints, dynamic programming with n up to 3*10^5 might not be feasible if it's O(n^2), so I need a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps a greedy approach where I always buy tickets on the day with the current lowest price, considering the accumulated increases.

Let me try that.

I can maintain a min-heap of days, ordered by a_i plus the accumulated increase for that day.

Initially, the accumulated increase is 0 for all days.

I need to buy k tickets, so I'll repeat the following k times:

- Pick the day with the smallest a_i plus accumulated increase.

- Buy one ticket on that day.

- Increase the accumulated increase for all other days by 1.

But this would be O(k log n), which could be up to 10^9 operations, which is too slow.

Given that k can be up to 10^9, and n up to 3*10^5, this is not efficient enough.

I need a way to buy multiple tickets at once, in larger chunks, to reduce the number of operations.

Perhaps I can buy as many tickets as possible on the current best day without exceeding m, and update the accumulated increase for the other days accordingly.

Wait, but removing days from the heap and updating the increases for the remaining days still seems inefficient if done one by one.

I need a better way to handle the accumulated increases.

Let me consider that the accumulated increase is the same for all days, except for the days on which I've already bought some tickets.

Wait, no, because the increase is based on the total tickets bought on previous days.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the total tickets bought so far and use that to calculate the increase.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the total increase for each day based on the days before it.

Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets I buy on each day, b_i, with sum(b_i) = k and b_i <= m for each i.

Then, the total cost is sum over i of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j).

I need to minimize this expression.

This seems similar to minimizing the dot product of two sequences, where one sequence is the b_i and the other is a_i plus the prefix sum of b_i.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I can use the fact that the total cost can be expressed as sum of b_i * a_i plus the sum of b_i * sum of b_j for j < i.

So, total cost = sum(b_i * a_i) + sum(b_i * sum_{j < i} b_j)

= sum(b_i * a_i) + sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_i * b_j

This still seems tricky.

Perhaps I can consider that the cost per ticket on day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, for each ticket bought on day i, the cost is a_i plus the total tickets bought on days 1 to i-1.

Thus, if I buy b_i tickets on day i, the cost is b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

Wait, that's the same as above.

This seems like a quadratic function, and I need to minimize it under the constraints sum(b_i) = k and b_i <= m.

Maybe I can model this as a linear programming problem, but that would be too slow for the given constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider sorting the days in order of a_i.

If I could buy tickets on the days with the smallest a_i first, that would be ideal, but I have to account for the increasing prices on subsequent days.

So, if I buy tickets on a day with a small a_i, it increases the prices for future days, which might make buying on later days more expensive.

So, there's a trade-off: buying on a day with a small a_i makes that purchase cheap but makes future purchases more expensive.

I need to find a balance.

Perhaps I should prioritize days with the smallest a_i minus the accumulated increase.

Wait, but the increase is based on the total tickets bought on previous days.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about an example.

Take the first test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

According to the sample explanation, buying 0 on day 1, 0 on day 2, 1 on day 3, and 2 on day 4, total cost is 10.

Let me verify:

- Day 1: buy 0 tickets, prices for days 2-4 remain [6,4,2]

- Day 2: buy 0 tickets, prices for days 3-4 remain [4,2]

- Day 3: buy 1 ticket, cost = 4, prices for day 4 become [2 + 1] = [3]

- Day 4: buy 2 tickets, cost = 2 * 3 = 6

- Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10

Another way: buy 1 ticket on day 1, then prices become [8,6+1,4+1,2+1] = [8,7,5,3], then buy 1 ticket on day 2 (cost=7), then prices become [8,7,5+1,3+1]=[8,7,6,4], then buy 1 ticket on day 4 (cost=4). Total cost = 8 + 7 + 4 = 19, which is worse.

So, in this case, buying later when prices have increased less is better.

But in the second test case:

n=4, m=2, k=8

a=[8,6,4,2]

Need to buy 8 tickets, with m=2 per day.

Only way is to buy 2 tickets each day, total 4 days, so 2*8 + 2*6 + 2*4 + 2*2 = 16 + 12 + 8 + 4 = 40.

Wait, but the sample output is 64, which suggests that's not the correct approach.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, if I buy 2 tickets on day 1, prices increase by 2 for subsequent days.

So, day 1: buy 2 tickets, cost=2*8=16, prices become [ -, 8+2, 4+2, 2+2 ] = [ -, 10, 6, 4 ]

Day 2: buy 2 tickets, cost=2*10=20, prices become [ -, -, 6+2, 4+2 ] = [ -, -, 8, 6 ]

Day 3: buy 2 tickets, cost=2*8=16, prices become [ -, -, -, 6+2 ] = [ -, -, -, 8 ]

Day 4: buy 2 tickets, cost=2*8=16

Total cost=16+20+16+16=68, but the sample output is 64. Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps the prices increase only for remaining days after each purchase.

Wait, in the first test case, according to the explanation, buying 1 ticket on day 3 and 2 tickets on day 4 costs 4 + 6 = 10.

Wait, but according to the rule, buying 1 ticket on day 3 increases prices for day 4 by 1, so day 4 price becomes 2 + 1 = 3, and buying 2 tickets costs 6.

Total cost=4 + 6=10.

In the second test case, buying 2 tickets each day:

Day 1: buy 2 tickets, cost=16, prices for remaining days increase by 2.

So, day 2 price becomes 6+2=8, day 3:4+2=6, day 4:2+2=4.

Day 2: buy 2 tickets, cost=16, prices for remaining days increase by another 2.

So, day 3:6+2=8, day 4:4+2=6.

Day 3: buy 2 tickets, cost=16, prices for day 4 increase by 2.

Day 4: price=6+2=8, buy 2 tickets, cost=16.

Total=16+16+16+16=64, which matches the sample.

So, my earlier miscalculation was wrong.

Alright, so the greedy approach of buying as much as possible on the cheapest available day doesn't seem to work, because in the first test case, it's better to delay buying to have lower prices.

But in the second test case, I have no choice but to buy on all days.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that the increase in price is proportional to the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, the cost of buying b_i tickets on day i is b_i * (a_i + sum of b_j for j < i).

I need to minimize sum over i of b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

This seems like a complicated expression to minimize directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the increasing prices.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning tickets to days, where each ticket assigned to day i has a cost of a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i.

So, if I assign ticket t to day i, its cost is a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days 1 to i-1.

Thus, the total cost is sum over all tickets of (a_{i(t)} + pos(t) -1), where pos(t) is the position of the day it's assigned to, considering the ordering of days.

Wait, that might not be directly helpful.

Another idea: since the price increase is cumulative based on previous purchases, maybe I can sort the days in some order to minimize the total cost.

Wait, perhaps sorting the days based on a_i in ascending order would be beneficial, because buying on cheaper days first would minimize the increase in prices for future days.

Wait, but in the first test case, a=[8,6,4,2], and buying on day 3 and day 4 gave a better result than buying on day 1 and day 2.

So, sorting in ascending order might not be the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe sorting in descending order.

Let me try sorting the days in descending order of a_i.

In the first test case, sorted a: [8,6,4,2], which is the same as the original.

If I buy 2 tickets on day 1 (cost=16), prices for remaining days increase by 2.

Then, buy 0 on day 2 (prices become [ -, 8+2=10, 4+2=6, 2+2=4 ])

Buy 0 on day 3 (prices become [ -, -, 6+0=6, 4+0=4 ])

Buy 1 on day 4 (cost=4)

Total cost=16 + 4=20, which is worse than the sample's 10.

So, sorting descending doesn't seem to help.

Alternatively, sorting in ascending order: [2,4,6,8]

Buy 1 on day 1 (cost=2), prices for remaining days increase by 1.

So, day 2:4+1=5, day 3:6+1=7, day 4:8+1=9

Buy 2 on day 2 (cost=10), prices for remaining days increase by 2.

Day 3:7+2=9, day 4:9+2=11

Buy 0 on day 3.

Buy 0 on day 4.

Total cost=2+10=12, which is better than 20 but still worse than 10.

So, sorting ascending also doesn't give the optimal.

Hence, sorting alone isn't sufficient.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled as selecting a subset of days and buying a certain number of tickets on those days, with the constraint that the total number of tickets bought is exactly k, and the cost is minimized, considering the increasing prices.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved using a priority queue, where I always pick the day with the smallest current price to buy as many tickets as possible, considering the daily limit m, and then update the prices for the remaining days accordingly.

But as I thought earlier, updating the prices for all remaining days in the queue after each purchase would be inefficient for large n and k.

I need a way to optimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the price increase is uniform across all remaining days, and find a way to group purchases together.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets I buy on each day, b_i, with sum(b_i) = k and b_i <= m.

Then, the total cost is sum over i of b_i * (a_i + sum over j < i of b_j)

This can be rewritten as sum over i of (b_i * a_i) + sum over i of (b_i * sum_{j < i} b_j)

The first term is linear in b_i, the second term is quadratic.

This seems like a quadratic optimization problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of prefix sums.

Let s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} b_j, the total tickets bought up to day i.

Then, the cost for day i is b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Since s_{i-1} = s_i - b_i, the cost for day i is b_i * (a_i + s_i - b_i) = b_i * a_i + b_i * s_i - b_i^2

Summing over all i, total cost is sum b_i * a_i + sum b_i * s_i - sum b_i^2

But s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} b_j, so sum b_i * s_i = sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * sum_{j=1 to i} b_j

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's another way.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum over all pairs of tickets bought on different days.

Wait, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this problem using the concept of minimum cost matching, but that seems too vague.

Let me think about the properties of the optimal solution.

Suppose that in the optimal solution, I buy b_i tickets on day i.

If there exists two days i and j, with i < j, and a_i + s_{i-1} > a_j + s_{j-1}, then perhaps I can reduce the cost by swapping some tickets between these days.

Wait, not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see if it makes sense.

The program defines a function func_1 that takes n, m, k, and prices as input.

It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the day with the smallest current price.

It initializes the heap with tuples of (price, day index).

Then, it repeatedly pops the day with the smallest price, adds the cost of buying as many tickets as possible on that day (up to m or k remaining), and increases the price for all remaining days in the heap by the number of tickets bought.

This seems similar to the greedy approach I considered earlier.

Let me see if this matches the sample input.

First test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

prices=[8,6,4,2]

Initialize heap: [(8,0), (6,1), (4,2), (2,3)]

First iteration: pop the smallest, which is (2,3). Current price is 2 + 0 = 2 (since price_increase=0). Buy min(m, k)=min(2,3)=2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 2 = 4. price_increase += 2.

Remaining k=1.

Now, update the heap: for all remaining days, increase price by 2.

So, remaining heap: [(6+2,1), (4+2,2), (8+2,0)] = [(8,1), (6,2), (10,0)]

Second iteration: pop the smallest, which is (6,2). Current price is 6 + 2 = 8. Buy 1 ticket. Cost = 8 * 1 = 8. price_increase +=1 -> price_increase=3.

Remaining k=0.

Total cost = 4 + 8 = 12, but according to the sample, it should be 10.

Hmm, so this approach doesn't match the sample.

Wait, in the sample, they bought 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4, costing 4 + 6 =10.

But according to this program, it buys 2 on day 4 and 1 on day 3, costing 4 + 8 =12.

So, it's suboptimal.

Thus, this program is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in simulating the program.

Let me try again.

Initialize heap: [(8,0), (6,1), (4,2), (2,3)]

price_increase=0

First pop: (2,3), price=2+0=2, buy 2 tickets, cost=4, price_increase=2

Remaining k=1

Update heap: for days 0,1,2: prices increase by 2

So, heap becomes: [(8,0), (6,1), (4,2)] with prices [8+2,6+2,4+2] = [10,8,6]

Second pop: (6,2), price=6+2=8, buy 1 ticket, cost=8, price_increase=3

Total cost=4+8=12

Yes, that matches my earlier calculation.

But in the sample, buying 1 on day 3 (price=4+0=4) and 2 on day 4 (price=2+1=3), costing 4 + 6=10.

So, the program misses this because it doesn't consider that buying on day 3 first would allow buying on day 4 at a higher price, but still cheaper overall.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the sample, it's possible to get 10, but the program gives 12.

So, the program is not correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
