Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array `a` of length `2n`, and it contains each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice. Then there's an integer `k` (between `1` and `n/2`), and I need to find two arrays `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`, with specific properties.

First, `l` should be a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`, and `r` should be a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`. Also, the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

The problem says that at least one pair of `l` and `r` always exists, which is good to know, so I don't have to worry about cases where it's impossible.

Alright, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what a subset means in this context. It says that a sequence `x` is a subset of `y` if `x` can be obtained by deleting several elements from `y` and rearranging them in any order. So, order doesn't matter, and elements can be repeated if they are in `y`.

Given that, I need to select `2k` elements from the first `n` elements to form `l`, and `2k` elements from the last `n` elements to form `r`, such that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

I need to find a way to select these elements appropriately.

Let me recall some properties of XOR. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order in which we XOR elements doesn't matter. Also, XOR-ing a number with itself results in `0`.

Given that each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in the entire array, split into two halves: the first `n` elements and the last `n` elements.

Let me denote the first half as `a1` and the second half as `a2`.

So, `a1` is `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`, and `a2` is `a[n]` to `a[2n-1]`.

I need to select `2k` elements from `a1` and `2k` elements from `a2` such that their XORs are equal.

One idea is to select pairs of identical elements from `a1` and `a2`, since XOR-ing the same number twice gives zero, which might help in balancing the XOR values.

But I need to select `2k` elements from each side, not necessarily `k` pairs.

Wait, but since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, some numbers will be split between `a1` and `a2`, and some might be duplicated in `a1` or `a2`.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider the XOR of all elements in `a1` and the XOR of all elements in `a2`. Since the entire array's XOR is the XOR of `a1` and `a2`, and given that each number from `1` to `n` appears twice, the overall XOR is zero (because each number XOR-ed with itself is zero).

Therefore, XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), because XOR(a1) XOR XOR(a2) == XOR(entire array) == 0, so XOR(a1) == XOR(a2).

That's an important observation.

So, XOR(a1) == XOR(a2).

Now, I need to select subsets `l` from `a1` and `r` from `a2`, each of size `2k`, such that XOR(l) == XOR(r).

Given that XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), maybe I can find subsets `l` and `r` such that XOR(a1) XOR XOR(l) == XOR(a2) XOR XOR(r), but since XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), this simplifies to XOR(l) == XOR(r).

Wait, that seems circular.

Let me think of another approach.

Perhaps I can select `l` and `r` such that the XOR of their elements is equal to XOR(a1) XOR some value that balances out.

Wait, maybe I should look into selecting elements in pairs.

Given that each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in the entire array, some of them might be in `a1` and some in `a2`.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in `a1` and `a2`.

Let me define:

- For each number `i` from `1` to `n`, let `freq1[i]` be the number of times `i` appears in `a1`.

- Similarly, `freq2[i]` be the number of times `i` appears in `a2`.

Given that each `i` appears exactly twice in total, `freq1[i] + freq2[i] == 2` for all `i`.

Now, I need to select `2k` elements from `a1` and `2k` elements from `a2` such that their XORs are equal.

One strategy could be to select elements in such a way that the XOR differences are balanced.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider small values of `k`.

If `k = 1`, I need to select `2` elements from `a1` and `2` elements from `a2` with equal XOR.

Given that, perhaps I can select two identical elements from `a1` and `a2`, but since each number appears exactly twice overall, if I select two identical elements from `a1`, they must be the same number, and similarly for `a2`.

Wait, but if I select two identical elements, their XOR is zero, which might be useful.

Wait, in the first example:

n = 2, k = 1

a = [1,2,2,1]

So a1 = [1,2], a2 = [2,1]

One possible selection is l = [2,1], r = [2,1], and 2 XOR 1 = 3 for both.

Another way could be to select l = [1,2], r = [1,2], which also gives 1 XOR 2 = 3.

So in this case, selecting the same elements in the same order works.

But is there a general way to do this?

Let me consider another example:

n = 6, k = 1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

a1 = [6,4,2,1,2,3]

a2 = [1,6,3,5,5,4]

I need to select 2 elements from a1 and 2 from a2 with equal XOR.

Looking at the output: l = [6,4], r = [1,3]

6 XOR 4 = 2, 1 XOR 3 = 2, which matches.

Another example:

n = 4, k = 1

a = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

Possible selection: l = [1,2], r = [1,2]

XOR is 3 for both.

Last example:

n = 6, k = 2

a = [5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

Need to select 4 elements from each side with equal XOR.

Output: l = [5,1,3,3], r = [6,4,2,4]

XOR of l: 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = (5 XOR 1) = 4, then 4 XOR 3 = 7, 7 XOR 3 = 4

XOR of r: 6 XOR 4 = 2, 2 XOR 2 = 0, 0 XOR 4 = 4

So both have XOR 4.

Okay, so in this case, it worked.

Now, I need a general strategy.

One idea is to select pairs of elements that have the same XOR value.

But selecting pairs might not be sufficient for larger `k`.

Wait, since `k` can be up to `n/2`, and `n` can be up to `5*10^4`, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) per test case.

Given the constraints, I need something linear or linearithmic at worst.

Let me think about the properties of XOR again.

If I can find a set of elements in `a1` and a set in `a2` such that their XORs are equal, and the sizes are `2k` each.

Given that XOR is associative and commutative, maybe I can find a difference in subsets.

But finding subsets with equal XOR is similar to finding if there are subsets with a particular XOR value, which is a classic problem, but it's usually NP-hard without some specific properties.

But here, since it's guaranteed that a solution exists, maybe there's a way to exploit that.

Wait, perhaps I can select `k` pairs of identical elements, one from `a1` and one from `a2`, and select them appropriately.

But since each number appears exactly twice, some in `a1` and some in `a2`.

Wait, perhaps I can group the numbers based on their frequency in `a1` and `a2`.

Let me consider:

- For each number `i`, if it appears twice in `a1`, then it must appear zero times in `a2`.

- If it appears once in `a1`, it appears once in `a2`.

- If it appears twice in `a2`, it appears zero times in `a1`.

But wait, since each number appears exactly twice in total, these are the only possibilities.

So, for each number `i`, freq1[i] + freq2[i] = 2.

Now, perhaps I can categorize the numbers based on their frequencies in `a1` and `a2`.

Let me define:

- Let S1 be the set of numbers that appear twice in `a1` and zero times in `a2`.

- Let S2 be the set of numbers that appear once in `a1` and once in `a2`.

- Let S3 be the set of numbers that appear zero times in `a1` and twice in `a2`.

But given that, S1 and S3 are possible, but S2 contains numbers that appear once in each.

Wait, but in the problem, since each number appears exactly twice, S1 and S3 can have at most `n` elements each, but in reality, S1 and S3 are mutually exclusive, and S2 contains the rest.

Wait, actually, S1 and S3 together can have up to `n` elements, but their union with S2 covers all `n` numbers.

Wait, no, S1, S2, and S3 are mutually exclusive and cover all `n` numbers.

Wait, but for each number, it can be in S1 (appears twice in a1), S2 (appears once in a1 and once in a2), or S3 (appears twice in a2).

So, |S1| + |S2| + |S3| = n.

Now, perhaps I can use these sets to construct `l` and `r`.

Let me think about the XOR values.

Let me denote XOR(a1) as the XOR of all elements in a1, and similarly for a2.

Since XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), as established earlier.

Now, suppose I select a subset `l` from a1 and a subset `r` from a2, both of size `2k`, and I want XOR(l) == XOR(r).

Given that, and knowing that XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), perhaps I can relate XOR(l) to XOR(a1) and XOR(r) to XOR(a2).

Wait, since XOR(l) should equal XOR(r), and XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), maybe I can select `l` and `r` such that XOR(a1) XOR XOR(l) == XOR(a2) XOR XOR(r), but since XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), this simplifies to XOR(l) == XOR(r), which is what I want.

Not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider that XOR is linear, so perhaps I can use linear algebra to solve for the subsets.

But that might be too slow for the constraints.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me look at the output requirements.

I need to output two lines: the first line contains `l1` to `l_{2k}`, and the second line contains `r1` to `r_{2k}`.

Given that, perhaps I can select elements in a way that balances the XOR.

Wait, maybe I can select elements from `a1` and `a2` in pairs that have the same XOR.

But I need to select `2k` elements from each.

Another idea: since XOR is associative and commutative, perhaps I can select elements such that their XOR cancels out appropriately.

Wait, maybe I can select elements from `a1` and `a2` that have the same XOR value.

But I need to select `2k` elements from each.

Let me consider that I need to select `k` pairs from `a1` and `a2` such that the XOR of selected elements in `a1` equals the XOR of selected elements in `a2`.

But I need to select `2k` elements from each, which is equivalent to selecting `k` pairs from each.

Wait, but pairs of what?

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting elements where the frequency allows.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and select elements accordingly.

Let me look back at the provided code to see how it approaches this.

Looking at the code:

It reads `t` test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, then reads the array `a` of size `2n`.

Then it initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of size `n`, presumably to keep track of frequencies in `a1` and `a2`.

It then proceeds to count the frequency of each number in `a1` and `a2`.

Then it tries to select elements for `l` and `r` based on these frequencies.

Looking closely:

- It counts how many times each number appears in `a1` and `a2`.

- Then it tries to select numbers that appear twice in `a1` and twice in `a2`.

- It also handles cases where numbers appear only once in `a1` or `a2`.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the XOR properties and subset selections.

Let me consider that I need to select `2k` elements from `a1` and `2k` elements from `a2` such that their XORs are equal.

Given that, and knowing that XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), maybe I can select subsets such that the XOR of the remaining elements in `a1` and `a2` are also equal.

But I'm going in circles here.

Let me consider a different approach.

Since it's guaranteed that a solution exists, perhaps I can select `2k` elements from `a1` and `2k` elements from `a2` in a way that their XORs match.

One way to ensure that is to select elements such that their XOR cancels out appropriately.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements from `a1` and `a2` that have the same XOR value.

But I need a way to select `2k` elements from each.

Let me consider that if I select a pair of identical elements from `a1` and `a2`, their XOR would be zero, which might help in balancing.

But if I select multiple such pairs, their XOR would still be zero.

Wait, maybe I can select `k` pairs from `a1` and `a2` where each pair has the same XOR, and then combine them.

But that seems complicated.

Let me consider that since XOR is associative and commutative, the order doesn't matter, and I can group elements accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements from `a1` and `a2` based on their frequency.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I select `2k` elements from `a1` and `2k` elements from `a2` such that the frequency of each number in `l` and `r` is the same as in the original array.

But that might not necessarily make their XOR equal.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the XOR of the entire `a1` and `a2`, and then select subsets that have the same XOR.

But I already know that XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), so maybe I can select subsets such that XOR(l) == XOR(r) == XOR(a1).

But that might not always be possible, especially since I need to select exactly `2k` elements.

Wait, perhaps I can select subsets such that XOR(l) == XOR(r), regardless of their relation to XOR(a1).

Given that, maybe I can select subsets where the XOR of selected elements in `l` and `r` are equal.

Let me consider that I can select any `2k` elements from `a1` and any `2k` elements from `a2`, as long as their XORs are equal.

But with large `n` and `k`, I need an efficient way to do this.

Perhaps I can look for differences in frequencies or look for elements that can balance the XOR.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that XOR is its own inverse, meaning that XOR-ing with the same value twice returns to the original value.

But I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Let me consider small values of `n` and `k` to see if I can find a pattern.

Take n=2, k=1:

a1 = [1,2], a2 = [2,1]

XOR(a1) = 1 XOR 2 = 3

XOR(a2) = 2 XOR 1 = 3

Now, I need to select 2 elements from a1 and 2 from a2 such that their XORs are equal.

Possible selections:

- l = [1,2], r = [2,1], XOR = 3 for both

- l = [1,1], r = [2,2], but 1 XOR 1 = 0, 2 XOR 2 = 0, which are equal

- l = [2,2], r = [1,1], same as above

But in the example, it's [2,1] and [2,1], which is fine.

So, in this case, selecting the same elements in the same or different order works.

Another example:

n=6, k=1

a1 = [6,4,2,1,2,3], a2 = [1,6,3,5,5,4]

XOR(a1) = 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = (6 XOR 4) = 2, then 2 XOR 2 = 0, 0 XOR 1 = 1, 1 XOR 3 = 2

XOR(a2) should be the same, let's check: 1 XOR 6 XOR 3 XOR 5 XOR 5 XOR 4 = (1 XOR 6) = 7, 7 XOR 3 = 4, 4 XOR 5 = 1, 1 XOR 5 = 4, 4 XOR 4 = 0

Wait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I need a better way to compute XOR(a1).

Let me compute XOR(a1):

6 XOR 4 = 2, 2 XOR 2 = 0, 0 XOR 1 = 1, 1 XOR 2 = 3, 3 XOR 3 = 0

Wait, that's 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0

Similarly, XOR(a2) = 1 XOR 6 XOR 3 XOR 5 XOR 5 XOR 4

1 XOR 6 = 7, 7 XOR 3 = 4, 4 XOR 5 = 1, 1 XOR 5 = 4, 4 XOR 4 = 0

So, XOR(a1) == XOR(a2) == 0

In the output, l = [6,4], r = [1,3]

XOR(l) = 6 XOR 4 = 2

XOR(r) = 1 XOR 3 = 2

So, they are equal, but XOR(l) != XOR(a1), which is fine, as long as XOR(l) == XOR(r)

Wait, but in this case, XOR(l) == XOR(r) == 2, which is different from XOR(a1) == 0

So, my earlier assumption that XOR(l) should be equal to XOR(a1) is incorrect.

So, perhaps I need to find subsets `l` and `r` with equal XOR, regardless of XOR(a1)

Now, how to find such subsets?

Let me think about selecting elements in pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can select `k` pairs from `a1` and `k` pairs from `a2` such that the XOR of the selected pairs in `a1` equals the XOR of the selected pairs in `a2`.

Given that each number appears exactly twice, I can group the pairs accordingly.

Wait, but `k` can be up to n/2, which could be up to 2.5*10^4, and n up to 5*10^4, so I need an efficient way.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice, I can think in terms of the differences in their frequencies in `a1` and `a2`.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements from `a1` and `a2` based on how many times they appear in each.

Let me consider the following approach:

- For numbers that appear twice in `a1` and zero times in `a2`, I can select both occurrences for `l`.

- Similarly, for numbers that appear twice in `a2` and zero times in `a1`, I can select both occurrences for `r`.

- For numbers that appear once in `a1` and once in `a2`, I can select one for `l` and one for `r`.

But I need to select `2k` elements for `l` and `r` each.

Wait, perhaps I can maximize the selection from numbers that appear twice in `a1` and twice in `a2`.

Wait, but in the second example, n=6, k=1, there are numbers that appear twice in `a1` and `a2`.

Wait, in that example, a1 = [6,4,2,1,2,3], a2 = [1,6,3,5,5,4]

So, frequencies:

- 1: once in a1, once in a2

- 2: twice in a1, zero in a2

- 3: once in a1, once in a2

- 4: once in a1, once in a2

- 5: zero in a1, twice in a2

- 6: once in a1, once in a2

So, numbers with freq1[i] == 2: 2

Numbers with freq1[i] == 1: 1,3,4,6

Numbers with freq1[i] == 0: 5

So, for numbers with freq1[i] == 2, I can select both for `l`, and for numbers with freq1[i] == 0, select both from `r`.

But in this example, selecting l = [2,2] and r = [5,5], but their XOR would be 0 for both, which is equal, but in the given output, it's l = [6,4], r = [1,3], which also have equal XOR.

So, perhaps there are multiple solutions, and I can choose any.

So, perhaps I can prioritize selecting numbers that appear twice in `a1` and twice in `a2`, but in this example, 2 appears twice in `a1` and zero in `a2`, and 5 appears zero in `a1` and twice in `a2`.

Wait, but in the output, they selected numbers that appear once in `a1` and once in `a2`.

So, perhaps I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that for numbers appearing twice in `a1`, selecting both for `l` gives XOR zero.

Similarly, for numbers appearing twice in `a2`, selecting both for `r` gives XOR zero.

For numbers appearing once in `a1` and once in `a2`, selecting one for `l` and one for `r` gives the same value to XOR.

Wait, let's think about it.

Suppose I have a number `x` that appears once in `a1` and once in `a2`.

If I select `x` for `l` and `x` for `r`, then XOR(l) includes `x`, and XOR(r) includes `x`, so their XORs will have `x` in both.

Similarly, if I select `x` in `l` and not in `r`, I need to balance it somehow.

Wait, perhaps I can categorize the selections based on the frequency groups.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me define:

- Group A: numbers that appear twice in `a1` and zero in `a2`.

- Group B: numbers that appear once in `a1` and once in `a2`.

- Group C: numbers that appear zero in `a1` and twice in `a2`.

Now, for Group A, I can select both occurrences for `l`, which gives XOR zero.

For Group C, I can select both occurrences for `r`, which gives XOR zero.

For Group B, if I select one occurrence in `l` and one in `r`, then XOR(l) includes `x` and XOR(r) includes `x`, so their XORs will have `x` in both.

If I select both occurrences of a number in `l` or `r`, their XOR for that group would be zero.

Wait, perhaps I can aim to select pairs that contribute zero to the XOR, and then adjust with other selections.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that I need to select `2k` elements from `a1` and `2k` from `a2`, and ensure that their XORs are equal.

Given that, perhaps I can select `k` pairs from `a1` and `k` pairs from `a2`, and ensure that the XOR of these pairs are equal.

But I need to define what constitutes a pair.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the XOR differences.

Wait, maybe I can use Gaussian elimination to find subsets with equal XOR, but that might be too slow for the constraints.

Given time constraints, I need a faster approach.

Let me consider that since XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), and I need XOR(l) == XOR(r), perhaps I can select subsets such that XOR(l) == XOR(r) == XOR(a1).

But in the second example, XOR(a1) == 0, but XOR(l) == 2, which is not equal to XOR(a1).

So, that assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to find subsets `l` and `r` such that XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) == 0, which is always true if XOR(l) == XOR(r).

Given that, and knowing that XOR(a1) == XOR(a2), perhaps there's a relationship, but I'm not sure.

Let me consider that the XOR of the selected subsets `l` and `r` should be equal, and I need to select `2k` elements from each.

Given that, perhaps I can prioritize selecting pairs that have the same XOR contribution.

But I need a clearer strategy.

Let me look back at the provided code to see how it approaches this.

In the code:

- It counts the frequency of each number in `a1` and `a2`.

- Then, it iterates through `a1` and selects numbers that appear twice in `a1` to include in `l`.

- It keeps track of how many elements have been selected for `l`.

- Then, if not enough elements have been selected, it selects numbers that appear once in `a1`.

- Similarly, for `r`, it selects numbers that appear twice in `a2`.

But I need to verify if this approach guarantees that XOR(l) == XOR(r).

Looking at the first example:

n=2, k=1

a1 = [1,2], a2 = [2,1]

Frequencies:

freq1 = [1,2] (indices 0 and 1, since a1 = [1,2], a2 = [2,1])

Wait, no, indices are from 0 to n-1, numbers are from 1 to n.

Wait, perhaps the code maps numbers to their frequencies.

So, for a1 = [1,2], freq1[0] = 1 (for number 1), freq1[1] = 1 (for number 2)

Wait, but in the code, it initializes `l` and `r` as [0]*n, then counts frequencies.

Wait, in the code, it seems to be counting frequencies correctly.

But in the first example, freq1[0] = 1, freq1[1] = 1

Then, since no number appears twice in `a1` or `a2`, it selects one occurrence from `a1` and one from `a2`.

But in the output, it selects [2,1] and [2,1], which works.

In the second example:

n=6, k=1

a1 = [6,4,2,1,2,3], a2 = [1,6,3,5,5,4]

freq1 = [1 (for 1), 1 (for 2), 1 (for 3), 1 (for 4), 0 (for 5), 1 (for 6)]

freq2 = [1,1,1,1,2,1]

So, numbers with freq1[i] == 2: none

numbers with freq1[i] == 1: all except 5

numbers with freq1[i] == 0: 5

So, in the code, it would select numbers that appear twice in `a1`, but none exist, so it selects numbers that appear once in `a1`.

In the output, it selects [6,4] and [1,3], which works.

But according to the code, it first selects numbers that appear twice in `a1`, then once, etc.

So, perhaps this approach works because it prioritizes selecting pairs that contribute zero to the XOR.

Wait, but in this case, no numbers appear twice in `a1`.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the code more carefully.

Looking back at the code:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] == 2:

print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')

l[a[i]-1] = 0

ul +=2

if ul == k*2:

break

Then, if ul < k*2, it selects remaining elements that appear once in `a1`.

Similarly for `r`.

But in the second example, no numbers appear twice in `a1` or `a2`, so it selects one occurrence from `a1` and one from `a2`.

But in the output, it selects [6,4] and [1,3], which works.

So, perhaps this approach is correct.

Wait, but in the code, it seems to select numbers that appear twice first, then once if needed.

But in the second example, no numbers appear twice in `a1` or `a2`, so it selects one occurrence from `a1` and one from `a2`.

But in the output, it selects [6,4] and [1,3], which are numbers that appear once in `a1` and once in `a2`.

So, perhaps this approach works.

Given that, perhaps the code is correct.

But to be sure, I need to verify if this approach always guarantees that XOR(l) == XOR(r).

Let me consider another test case.

Suppose n=4, k=1

a1 = [1,2,3,4], a2 = [1,2,3,4]

freq1 = [1,1,1,1], freq2 = [1,1,1,1]

According to the code, it would select one occurrence from `a1` and one from `a2`.

For example, select [1,2] from `a1` and [1,2] from `a2`, which works.

XOR(l) = 1 XOR 2 = 3, XOR(r) = 1 XOR 2 = 3, which matches.

Another test case:

n=3, k=1

a1 = [1,2,2], a2 = [1,3,3]

freq1 = [1,2,0], freq2 = [1,0,2]

So, number 1: once in `a1`, once in `a2`

number 2: twice in `a1`, zero in `a2`

number 3: zero in `a1`, twice in `a2`

According to the code:

First, select numbers that appear twice in `a1`: number 2, select both, ul +=2

Then, ul == 2 == 2*k, so no need to select more.

Then, for r, select numbers that appear twice in `a2`: number 3, select both.

So, l = [2,2], r = [3,3], XOR(l) = 0, XOR(r) = 0, which matches.

Another test case:

n=3, k=1

a1 = [1,2,3], a2 = [1,2,3]

freq1 = [1,1,1], freq2 = [1,1,1]

Select one occurrence from `a1` and one from `a2`.

For example, l = [1,2], r = [1,2], XOR(l) = 3, XOR(r) = 3, which matches.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=4, k=2

a1 = [1,1,2,2], a2 = [3,3,4,4]

freq1 = [2,2,0,0], freq2 = [0,0,2,2]

According to the code:

Select numbers that appear twice in `a1`: 1 and 2, select [1,1,2,2], ul=4

Then, for r, select numbers that appear twice in `a2`: 3 and 4, select [3,3,4,4], ur=4

XOR(l) = 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 = 0, XOR(r) = 3 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 0, which matches.

So, in this case, it works.

Another test case:

n=4, k=1

a1 = [1,2,2,3], a2 = [1,3,4,4]

freq1 = [1,2,1,0], freq2 = [1,0,1,2]

Select numbers that appear twice in `a1`: 2, select [2,2], ul=2

Then, for r, select numbers that appear twice in `a2`: 4, select [4,4], ur=2

XOR(l) = 2 XOR 2 = 0, XOR(r) = 4 XOR 4 = 0, which matches.

Another test case:

n=5, k=2

a1 = [1,2,3,4,4], a2 = [1,2,3,5,5]

freq1 = [1,1,1,2,0], freq2 = [1,1,1,0,2]

Select numbers that appear twice in `a1`: 4, select [4,4], ul=2

Then, need to select 2 more elements for l.

Select numbers that appear once in `a1`: select [1,2]

So, l = [4,4,1,2], XOR(l) = 4 XOR 4 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 0 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 3

For r, select numbers that appear twice in `a2`: 5, select [5,5], ur=2

Need to select 2 more elements for r.

Select numbers that appear once in `a2`: select [1,2]

So, r = [5,5,1,2], XOR(r) = 5 XOR 5 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 0 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 3

Which matches XOR(l) == XOR(r) == 3

So, this seems correct.

Given these observations, it seems that the approach in the code is correct.

It prioritizes selecting
