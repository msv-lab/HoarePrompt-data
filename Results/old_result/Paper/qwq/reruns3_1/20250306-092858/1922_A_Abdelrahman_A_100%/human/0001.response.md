Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The problem explains that:

- If the i-th character of t is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as that of t.

- If the i-th character of t is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the t's i-th character.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template t, meaning that there should be at least one position where it doesn't satisfy the above conditions.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find a template t such that:

1. a matches t based on the rules above.

2. b matches t based on the rules above.

3. c does not match t, meaning that there is at least one position where c doesn't satisfy the matching rules for t.

Given that t can have both lowercase and uppercase letters, I need to decide for each position in t whether to make it lowercase or uppercase, and what letter to choose.

Let's consider each position independently.

For each position i from 1 to n:

- If I choose t[i] to be lowercase, say 'x', then both a[i] and b[i] must be 'x', and c[i] must not be 'x'.

- If I choose t[i] to be uppercase, say 'X', then both a[i] and b[i] must be any letter except 'x', and c[i] must be 'x'.

Wait, let's rephrase that.

If t[i] is lowercase 'x', then:

- a[i] must be 'x'

- b[i] must be 'x'

- c[i] must not be 'x' for c to not match.

If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then:

- a[i] must not be 'x'

- b[i] must not be 'x'

- c[i] must be 'x' for c to not match.

Wait, actually, if t[i] is 'X' (uppercase), then:

- a[i] must not be 'x' (lowercase version of 'X')

- b[i] must not be 'x'

- For c to not match, c[i] must be 'x'

So, for each position, I have two choices for t[i]: lowercase or uppercase.

I need to choose for each position whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase, and what letter it is, such that the conditions for a, b, and c are satisfied.

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to look at this.

Let me consider that t is fixed in structure, but I need to find if there's any possible t that satisfies the conditions.

Another way is to think about the constraints imposed by a, b, and c on each position independently.

For each position i, let's look at a[i], b[i], and c[i].

I need to choose t[i] such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase, say 'x', then a[i] == 'x', b[i] == 'x', and c[i] != 'x'

- If t[i] is uppercase, say 'X', then a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'

So, for each position, I have these two options for t[i], and I need to choose one that fits the values of a[i], b[i], and c[i].

But, I need to ensure that for all positions, the choices are consistent.

Wait, but the problem allows t to have any combination of lowercase and uppercase letters for each position, independently.

So, perhaps I can consider each position separately and see if there's a choice for t[i] that satisfies the conditions for a[i], b[i], and c[i].

But, there's a catch: for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's rule.

Meanwhile, a and b must match the template at all positions.

So, perhaps I can think of it as:

- For each position, choose t[i] in a way that a[i] and b[i] match t[i], and c[i] does not match t[i].

But, c must not match the template overall, which means that there must be at least one position where c does not match t.

However, c might have positions where it matches t, but as long as there's at least one position where it doesn't match, that's fine.

Wait, no. The problem says that c does not match the template, which means that there is at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's rule.

But a and b must match the template at all positions.

So, for a and b, every position must satisfy the template's rule.

For c, at least one position must not satisfy the template's rule.

So, I need to find a template t such that:

- For all i, a matches t at position i.

- For all i, b matches t at position i.

- There exists at least one i where c does not match t at position i.

Given that, perhaps I can consider each position independently and see what constraints they impose on t[i].

Let me consider position i.

Given a[i], b[i], and c[i], what are the possible choices for t[i]?

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase 'x'.

- Then, a[i] must be 'x'

- b[i] must be 'x'

- c[i] must not be 'x'

So, this choice is possible only if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase 'X'.

- Then, a[i] must not be 'x'

- b[i] must not be 'x'

- c[i] must be 'x'

So, this choice is possible only if a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'

Wait, but in the uppercase case, t[i] is 'X', and the rule is that a[i] and b[i] must not be 'x', and c[i] must be 'x'.

But, I need to choose 'x' appropriately.

Wait, in the uppercase case, t[i] is 'X', and the rule is that a[i] and b[i] must not be 'x', and c[i] must be 'x'.

But, I need to choose what 'x' is based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Wait a minute, t[i] can be any letter, lowercase or uppercase.

So, for t[i], if I choose it to be lowercase, say 'x', then:

- a[i] must be 'x'

- b[i] must be 'x'

- c[i] must not be 'x'

If I choose t[i] to be uppercase, say 'X', then:

- a[i] must not be 'x'

- b[i] must not be 'x'

- c[i] must be 'x'

So, for each position, I need to choose a specific letter for t[i], either lowercase 'x' or uppercase 'X', depending on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

But, I need to choose the same 'x' for all positions where t[i] is chosen.

Wait, no. The template t is a string of length n, and each t[i] can be any lowercase or uppercase letter independently.

So, t[i] can be different from t[j] for different positions i and j.

Wait, but in the problem statement, t consists of n lowercase and/or uppercase letters, and for each position, the rules are applied independently.

So, for each position i, t[i] is independent of t[j] for j != i.

Therefore, for each position i, I can choose t[i] independently, as either lowercase 'x' or uppercase 'X', where 'x' is any lowercase letter.

So, for each position, I can choose t[i] to be any lowercase or uppercase letter, subject to the constraints imposed by a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Wait, but in the earlier cases:

- If I choose t[i] as lowercase 'x', then a[i] and b[i] must be 'x', and c[i] must not be 'x'.

- If I choose t[i] as uppercase 'X', then a[i] and b[i] must not be 'x', and c[i] must be 'x'.

But, in this case, 'x' is determined by the choice of t[i].

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me fix the letter 'x' for each position.

For each position i, I can choose t[i] to be either a lowercase letter 'x' or an uppercase letter 'X', where 'x' is any lowercase letter.

So, for each position, I can choose any letter 'x' from a to z, and then choose whether t[i] is 'x' (lowercase) or 'X' (uppercase).

Given that, for each position i:

- If t[i] is 'x' (lowercase):

  - a[i] must be 'x'

  - b[i] must be 'x'

  - c[i] must not be 'x'

- If t[i] is 'X' (uppercase):

  - a[i] must not be 'x'

  - b[i] must not be 'x'

  - c[i] must be 'x'

So, for each position, I need to choose 'x' and the case of t[i] such that these conditions hold.

Now, for a and b to match the template at all positions, and c to not match at least one position, I need to make sure that:

- For each position i:

  - If t[i] is lowercase 'x':

    - a[i] == 'x'

    - b[i] == 'x'

    - c[i] != 'x'

  - If t[i] is uppercase 'X':

    - a[i] != 'x'

    - b[i] != 'x'

    - c[i] == 'x'

And, there must be at least one position where c does not match t.

But, I need to choose 'x' for each position independently.

Wait, but 'x' is the letter chosen for t[i], so for each position, I can choose a different 'x'.

Wait, that might be confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that for each position i, t[i] is a specific letter, either lowercase or uppercase.

So, t[i] can be any of the 52 possible letters (26 lowercase + 26 uppercase).

Given that, for each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase 'x', then:

  - a[i] must be 'x'

  - b[i] must be 'x'

  - c[i] must not be 'x'

- If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then:

  - a[i] must not be 'x'

  - b[i] must not be 'x'

  - c[i] must be 'x'

So, for each position, I need to choose t[i] such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase 'x', then a[i] and b[i] are both 'x', and c[i] is not 'x'.

- If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then a[i] and b[i] are both not 'x', and c[i] is 'x'.

But, I need to choose 'x' appropriately for each position.

Wait, but t[i] determines 'x'.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate over all possible choices of t[i] for each position and see if they satisfy the conditions.

But that's not practical because t[i] can be any of 52 letters for each position, and n can be up to 20, which would result in 52^20 possibilities, which is way too large.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that for each position i, there are constraints on what t[i] can be based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

So, for each position i, I can look at a[i], b[i], and c[i], and determine what t[i] can be.

Let me formalize the possibilities for t[i] at each position i.

Given a[i], b[i], and c[i], let's consider the possible choices for t[i]:

1. Choose t[i] as lowercase 'x', where 'x' is a lowercase letter.

   - Then:

     - a[i] must be 'x'

     - b[i] must be 'x'

     - c[i] must not be 'x'

   - Therefore, for this choice to be possible:

     - a[i] == b[i]

     - c[i] != a[i]

     - 'x' is set to a[i] (which is equal to b[i])

2. Choose t[i] as uppercase 'X', where 'X' is the uppercase version of 'x'.

   - Then:

     - a[i] must not be 'x'

     - b[i] must not be 'x'

     - c[i] must be 'x'

   - Therefore, for this choice to be possible:

     - a[i] != 'x'

     - b[i] != 'x'

     - c[i] == 'x'

     - 'x' is set to c[i]

So, for each position i, I have two possibilities for t[i]:

- Option 1: t[i] is lowercase 'x', where 'x' is a[i], and a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- Option 2: t[i] is uppercase 'X', where 'X' is the uppercase version of c[i], and a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Wait, in option 2, 'x' is c[i], and t[i] is uppercase 'X', where 'X' is the uppercase version of 'x'.

So, t[i] would be the uppercase version of c[i].

Given that, the conditions are:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

- c[i] == 'x' (which is c[i]), so this is already satisfied.

Wait, it's a bit confusing.

Let me try to rephrase.

For each position i:

- If I choose t[i] to be lowercase 'x', where 'x' is a[i]:

  - Requirements:

    - a[i] == 'x'

    - b[i] == 'x'

    - c[i] != 'x'

  - So, a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- If I choose t[i] to be uppercase 'X', where 'X' is the uppercase version of some letter 'x':

  - I need to choose 'x' such that:

    - a[i] != 'x'

    - b[i] != 'x'

    - c[i] == 'x'

  - So, 'x' must be equal to c[i], and a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Therefore, for each position i, I have two options for t[i]:

1. t[i] is lowercase a[i], provided that a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

2. t[i] is uppercase version of c[i], provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

So, for each position i, I can choose t[i] only if one of these two sets of conditions is met.

Moreover, I need to ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match t.

But, since for each position where t[i] is chosen, c does not match t[i] in option 1, or matches t[i] in option 2 only if c[i] == 'x', but in option 2, c[i] == 'x', which would make c match t[i] unless I choose option 1 for that position.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Let me think differently.

I need to choose for each position i either option 1 or option 2, if possible, and ensure that overall, c does not match the template.

But, in option 1, c does not match t[i], and in option 2, c matches t[i].

So, if I choose option 1 for at least one position, then c will not match t at that position.

Therefore, to satisfy the condition that c does not match t, I need to choose option 1 for at least one position.

Moreover, for all positions, a and b must match t.

So, my strategy should be:

- For each position i:

  - If possible, choose option 1: t[i] is lowercase a[i], provided a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

  - Else, choose option 2: t[i] is uppercase version of c[i], provided a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

- Ensure that at least one position is chosen with option 1, so that c does not match t.

Wait, but if I choose option 2 for some positions, c matches t at those positions, but as long as there is at least one position where c does not match t (chosen with option 1), then overall, c does not match t.

So, the overall approach is:

- For each position i:

  - If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then choose option 1: t[i] is lowercase a[i]

  - Else, choose option 2: t[i] is uppercase version of c[i], but only if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

- Additionally, ensure that at least one position is chosen with option 1.

Wait, but in the else clause, option 2 is only possible if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

So, in positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], choose option 1.

In positions where a[i] != b[i], or a[i] == b[i] but c[i] == a[i], then choose option 2 if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

But, if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], then I cannot choose option 1, and option 2 requires a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], which would be false since c[i] == a[i].

Hence, in such positions, I cannot choose any option, meaning that no template exists for such positions.

Therefore, I need to iterate through all positions and check:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

  - If c[i] != a[i], then I can choose option 1.

  - Else (c[i] == a[i]), I cannot choose option 1, and must choose option 2, but option 2 requires a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], which are not satisfied, so no option is possible.

- If a[i] != b[i]:

  - Cannot choose option 1, since a[i] != b[i]

  - Must choose option 2, which requires a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

So, in summary:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - If c[i] != a[i], choose option 1: t[i] is lowercase a[i]

  - Else, no option is possible

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - Must choose option 2: t[i] is uppercase version of c[i], but only if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Therefore, to have a valid template t:

- For all positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - Must have c[i] != a[i]

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - Must have a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Additionally, since c must not match t, which is ensured if at least one position is chosen with option 1 (where c does not match t).

But, in positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], we choose option 1, which ensures that c does not match t at that position.

So, as long as there is at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then we can choose option 1 for that position and option 2 for other positions where a[i] != b[i], provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Wait, but in positions where a[i] != b[i], we must have a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] to choose option 2.

So, the conditions for the existence of such a template t are:

- For all positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - c[i] != a[i]

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

And, there must be at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], to ensure that c does not match t.

Wait, but if there are positions where a[i] != b[i], and a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then we can choose option 2 for those positions, and as long as there is at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], to ensure that c does not match t at that position.

Alternatively, if there are no positions where a[i] == b[i], then we must have a[i] != b[i] for all positions, and in such cases, we must have a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] for all positions, and since c must not match t, which is ensured by choosing option 2 for all positions, where c[i] == 'x', and t[i] is uppercase 'X', meaning that c matches t at those positions, but since c must not match t overall, we need at least one position where c does not match t.

Wait, but in this case, if we choose option 2 for all positions, c matches t at all positions, which would mean that c matches t, which violates the condition that c does not match t.

Therefore, in this scenario, it's impossible to have such a template t, because c would match t at all positions, which contradicts the requirement that c does not match t.

Therefore, to have a valid template t, we must have at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], allowing us to choose option 1 for that position, ensuring that c does not match t at that position.

Additionally, for positions where a[i] != b[i], we must have a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], to be able to choose option 2 for those positions.

So, in code, for each test case, I need to:

- Iterate through each position i from 1 to n.

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - Check if c[i] != a[i]

  - Collect the count of such positions.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - Check if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

- If there is at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], and for all positions where a[i] != b[i], a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then output "YES"

- Else, output "NO"

Wait, but there's a catch.

If there are positions where a[i] != b[i], and a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i], then it's impossible to choose option 2 for those positions, hence no valid template exists.

Also, if there are no positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then even if other conditions are satisfied, c would match t at all positions, which violates the condition that c does not match t.

Hence, the final condition is:

- There must be at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i], must have a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

If both these conditions are satisfied, then output "YES", else "NO"

Let me verify this with the example provided.

Example 1:

Input:

4

1

a

b

c

Output:

YES

Explanation:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

Check positions where a[i] == b[i]: none, since a[1] != b[1]

So, no positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

But, since there are no positions where a[i] == b[i], the first condition is not met (no position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i])

However, in the explanation, it says to use template "C", where t[1] = "C"

Then, for a[1] = "a", t[1] = "C" (uppercase), so a[1] must not be "c", which is true since "a" != "c"

Similarly, b[1] = "b", which is not "c"

c[1] = "c", which must be "c", so c matches t at this position.

But according to the explanation, c does not match t because the first letter is 'c', but according to the rules, if t[i] is uppercase 'C', then c[i] must be 'c' to match t.

Wait, perhaps I misread the explanation.

In the explanation, it says: "The first letter of strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match."

Wait, maybe the template is "C", which is uppercase, so for a and b to match, they must have a[1] != "c" and b[1] != "c", which they do ("a" and "b" != "c"), and c[1] == "c", so c does not match the template.

Wait, but according to the rules, if t[i] is uppercase 'C', then:

- a[i] must not be 'c'

- b[i] must not be 'c'

- c[i] must be 'c'

Which is satisfied here, since a[1] != "c", b[1] != "c", and c[1] == "c"

Hence, a and b match t, and c does not match t.

So, in this case, even though there are no positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], it's still possible to choose t[i] as uppercase 'C' for all positions where a[i] != b[i], and have c not match t at least at one position.

Wait, in this example, n=1, a="a", b="b", c="c"

So, position 1:

- a[1] != b[1]

- a[1] != "c" and b[1] != "c"

Hence, can choose t[1] as uppercase 'C'

Then, c[1] == "c", which matches t[1] being uppercase 'C'

Wait, but according to the problem, c must not match t, meaning that there must be at least one position where c does not match t.

But in this case, c matches t at position 1.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "the string c does not match the template t, while the strings a and b match it."

But in this example, c matches t at position 1, which contradicts the requirement.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, in the explanation, it says: "The first letter of strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match."

Wait, perhaps I misread the explanation.

Wait, perhaps if t[i] is uppercase 'C', then for a and b to match, they must have a[i] != 'c' and b[i] != 'c', which they do.

For c to not match, c[i] must be 'c', which it is.

Wait, but according to the problem, if t[i] is uppercase, then for c to not match, c[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], which is 'c'.

But in this case, c[i] == 'c', so it does not satisfy the condition to match t, hence c does not match t.

Wait, perhaps I need to revisit the condition for c not matching t.

The problem says: "the string c does not match the template t", meaning that there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's rule.

In this example, since t[i] is uppercase 'C', the rule for c is that c[i] must be different from 'c', but c[i] == 'c', so it does not satisfy the rule, hence c does not match t.

Therefore, in this case, it's "YES"

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought that if t[i] is uppercase 'C', then c[i] must be 'c' to match t, but according to the problem, c must not match t, meaning that c[i] must not satisfy the condition for uppercase 'C', which is c[i] must be different from 'c'.

Wait, no.

Let me re-express it.

If t[i] is uppercase 'C', then:

- a[i] must not be 'c'

- b[i] must not be 'c'

- c[i] must be 'c' to match t.

But, for c to not match t, c[i] must not satisfy the condition for uppercase 'C', which is c[i] must be different from 'c'.

Wait, no.

The condition for c not matching t is that there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's rule.

In this case, if t[i] is uppercase 'C', the rule for c is that c[i] must be different from 'c' to match t.

But c[i] == 'c', so it does not satisfy the condition to match t, hence c does not match t.

Therefore, in this example, choosing t[i] = 'C' makes a and b match t, and c not match t.

Hence, "YES"

So, in my earlier reasoning, I had a mistake.

Let me correct it.

In positions where t[i] is uppercase 'X', c must be different from 'x' to match t.

But, if c[i] == 'x', then c does not match t.

Wait, no.

If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then:

- a[i] must not be 'x'

- b[i] must not be 'x'

- c[i] must be 'x' to match t.

Therefore, if c[i] == 'x', then c matches t at that position.

If c[i] != 'x', then c does not match t at that position.

So, in the first test case:

- t[i] = 'C' (uppercase)

- a[i] != 'c'

- b[i] != 'c'

- c[i] == 'c', so c matches t at this position.

But, according to the problem, c must not match t, meaning that there must be at least one position where c does not match t.

In this case, since n=1 and c matches t at the only position, it should be "NO", but the sample output is "YES".

Wait, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Let me read the problem statement again.

"the string c does not match the template t, while the strings a and b match it."

"the string c does not match the template t" means that there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's rule.

In the first test case:

- t[i] = 'C' (uppercase)

- For c to match t, c[i] must be 'c' (since t[i] is 'C', c[i] must be 'c' to match)

- But, in this case, c[i] == 'c', so c matches t at this position.

Therefore, c matches t at all positions, which contradicts the requirement that c does not match t.

But the sample output is "YES", which suggests that my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpret the condition for c not matching t.

The problem says: "the string c does not match the template t", which means that c does not satisfy the template at least in one position.

But in this test case, with t[i] = 'C', c matches t at the only position, so it should be "NO", but the sample output is "YES".

Hence, my understanding is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that t can have a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters.

But in this test case, n=1, so t has only one character.

Wait, perhaps I misread the explanation.

In the explanation, it says: "you can use the template "C". The first letter of strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match."

Wait, according to the rules:

- If t[i] is uppercase 'C', then:

  - a[i] must not be 'c'

  - b[i] must not be 'c'

  - c[i] must be 'c' to match t.

In this case, a[i] = 'a' != 'c', b[i] = 'b' != 'c', c[i] = 'c' == 'c', so c matches t.

But the explanation says that c doesn't match.

Wait, maybe there's a confusion in the explanation.

Alternatively, perhaps the template is "C" (uppercase), and for c to not match, c[i] must be different from 'c', but c[i] == 'c', so it does not satisfy the condition to match t, hence c does not match t.

Wait, perhaps I need to revisit the problem statement.

The problem says:

- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i.

Wait, no, it says:

- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i.

So, for c to match t at position i, if t[i] is uppercase 'X', then c[i] must be different from 'x'.

In the first test case:

- t[i] = 'C' (uppercase)

- c[i] = 'c', which is equal to the lowercase version of 'C', which is 'c'

- Therefore, c[i] is not different from 'c', so c does not match t at this position.

Hence, c does not match t, because there exists at least one position (the only one) where c[i] is not different from the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no.

If t[i] is uppercase 'C', then for c to match t, c[i] must be different from 'c'.

But c[i] == 'c', which is not different from 'c', so c does not match t at this position.

Therefore, c does not match t, which satisfies the condition.

Hence, "YES"

I see, I misread the problem earlier.

So, to clarify:

- If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then for c to match t, c[i] must be different from 'x'

- If c[i] == 'x', then c does not match t at that position

- If c[i] != 'x', then c matches t at that position

In the first test case:

- t[i] = 'C' (uppercase)

- c[i] = 'c', which is equal to 'c', so c does not match t at this position.

Hence, c does not match t, which is what we need.

Therefore, the condition is satisfied, and the output is "YES"

So, in my earlier reasoning, I had a mistake in understanding the condition for c not matching t.

Let me correct my approach.

Given that:

- For t[i] being uppercase 'X', for c to match t, c[i] must be different from 'x'

- Therefore, if c[i] == 'x', then c does not match t at that position

- If c[i] != 'x', then c matches t at that position

Hence, to have c not match t, I need to have at least one position where c does not match t, which can be achieved by choosing t[i] such that c[i] == 'x' when t[i] is uppercase 'X'

Wait, no.

If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then c must have c[i] different from 'x' to match t.

So, if c[i] == 'x', then c does not match t at that position.

Therefore, to have c not match t, I can choose t[i] as uppercase 'X' for positions where c[i] == 'x', and ensure that a and b match t at those positions.

Similarly, for positions where a[i] == b[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], provided that c[i] != a[i]

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of constraints for each position.

For each position i:

- If I choose t[i] as lowercase 'x':

  - a[i] == 'x'

  - b[i] == 'x'

  - c[i] != 'x'

- If I choose t[i] as uppercase 'X':

  - a[i] != 'x'

  - b[i] != 'x'

  - c[i] == 'x'

So, for each position, I have these two options, and I need to choose at least one position where c does not match t, which corresponds to choosing option 1 where c[i] != 'x'

Wait, no.

In option 1 (t[i] is lowercase 'x'):

- a[i] == 'x'

- b[i] == 'x'

- c[i] != 'x'

- Choosing this option ensures that c does not match t at this position.

In option 2 (t[i] is uppercase 'X'):

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

- Choosing this option ensures that c matches t at this position, since c[i] == 'x', and t[i] is uppercase 'X', which requires c[i] to be different from 'x' to match t.

Wait, no.

Wait, if t[i] is uppercase 'X', then for c to match t, c[i] must be different from 'x'

But, in option 2, c[i] == 'x', so c does not match t at this position.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me re-express it.

If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- For c to match t, c[i] must be different from 'x'

- For c to not match t, c[i] == 'x'

So, if I choose t[i] as uppercase 'X', then c must have c[i] == 'x' to not match t.

Hence, to have c not match t, I can choose t[i] as uppercase 'X' for positions where c[i] == 'x', provided that a[i] != 'x' and b[i] != 'x'

Similarly, I can choose t[i] as lowercase 'x' for positions where a[i] == b[i] == 'x' and c[i] != 'x'

So, in summary, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

  - If c[i] != a[i], choose t[i] as lowercase a[i]

  - Else, no option is possible

- Else (a[i] != b[i]):

  - If a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], choose t[i] as uppercase c[i]

  - Else, no option is possible

And, ensure that at least one position is chosen where c does not match t, which can be achieved by choosing option 1 (lowercase 'x') for at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

Wait, but in positions where a[i] != b[i], and a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], I can choose t[i] as uppercase c[i], which would make c not match t at that position, because c[i] == 'x', but t[i] is uppercase 'X', which requires c[i] to be different from 'x' to match t.

Wait, no.

If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then for c to match t, c[i] must be different from 'x'

But, if c[i] == 'x', then c does not match t at that position.

Hence, choosing t[i] as uppercase 'X' for positions where c[i] == 'x', a[i] != 'x', and b[i] != 'x', ensures that c does not match t at that position.

Therefore, in such positions, choosing option 2 makes c not match t.

So, to satisfy the condition that c does not match t, I need to have at least one position where c does not match t, which can be achieved by choosing either:

- Option 1: t[i] is lowercase a[i], where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- Option 2: t[i] is uppercase c[i], where a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i], and c[i] == c[i], which ensures c does not match t at that position.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I choose t[i] as uppercase c[i], then for c to match t, c[i] must be different from c[i], which is impossible, so c does not match t at that position.

Hence, choosing option 2 ensures that c does not match t at that position.

Therefore, to have c not match t, I can choose option 2 for at least one position where a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i], and c[i] == c[i], which is always true.

Wait, no.

Wait, I'm getting tangled again.

Let me try to think in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a template t are:

- There exists at least one position i where:

  - Either:

    - a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

    - Or:

    - a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i], and t[i] is chosen as uppercase c[i]

- For all other positions:

  - If a[i] == b[i], then c[i] != a[i]

  - If a[i] != b[i], then a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Wait, perhaps it's simpler to check:

- For the positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - c[i] != a[i]

- For the positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

And, there must be at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or a position where a[i] != b[i], a[i] != c[i], and b[i] != c[i]

Wait, no.

Wait, in positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], ensuring that c does not match t at that position.

In positions where a[i] != b[i], I must have a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], and choose t[i] as uppercase c[i], which ensures that c does not match t at that position.

Therefore, the conditions are:

- For all positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i]

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i], a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

- Additionally, there must be at least one position where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or at least one position where a[i] != b[i], a[i] != c[i], and b[i]
