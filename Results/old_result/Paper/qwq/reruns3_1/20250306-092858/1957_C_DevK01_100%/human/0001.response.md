Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where me and the computer take turns placing rooks, but we have to make sure that no two rooks attack each other. Rooks attack each other if they're in the same row or column.

I start first by placing a white rook at some position (r, c), and then the computer places a black rook at (c, r), unless r equals c, in which case the computer skips its turn. This has already happened k times, and now I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible from this point onward, considering that we keep playing until no more moves are valid.

The answer needs to be modulo 10^9 + 7 because the numbers can get really big.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

1. **Placing Rooks:**

- I place a white rook at (r, c).

- The computer places a black rook at (c, r), unless r == c, in which case it skips.

- We have to ensure that no two rooks are in the same row or column.

2. **Initial State:**

- After k moves, there are k white rooks and possibly k black rooks on the board, depending on whether any moves were mirrored or skipped.

- It's guaranteed that all these moves are valid, meaning no two rooks attack each other.

3. **Objective:**

- Determine how many different final configurations are possible from this state onward, considering that we continue playing until no more moves are valid.

- Two configurations are different if there's at least one position where the rooks differ in presence or color.

Given that, I need to find a way to calculate the number of possible ways the game can proceed from the current state to its conclusion.

Let me try to break this down.

**Understanding the Game Dynamics:**

- Each move I make, the computer mirrors it by swapping rows and columns, unless I place on the diagonal, in which case it skips.

- So, if I place at (r, c), the computer places at (c, r), unless r == c.

- This mirroring suggests some symmetry in the board.

- The game continues until no more moves are possible, meaning the board is fully occupied without any attacks.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Diagonal Moves:**

- If I place a rook on the diagonal (r == c), the computer skips its turn.

- This means that diagonal moves don't get mirrored.

2. **Off-Diagonal Moves:**

- For off-diagonal moves (r != c), the computer mirrors the move, placing a rook at (c, r).

- These pairs of moves (mine and the computer's) together occupy two positions that are mirrors of each other across the diagonal.

3. **No Attacks:**

- No two rooks share the same row or column.

- This is similar to placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard, which is equivalent to placing a permutation matrix.

But in this case, there are colors and mirroring involved, making it more complex.

**Simplifying the Problem:**

Let's think about the degrees of freedom left after the initial k moves.

- Some rows and columns are already occupied by the existing rooks.

- The remaining part of the board is where we can still place rooks.

- I need to calculate how many ways I can place rooks in the remaining part, considering the mirroring rule.

**Modeling the Remaining Board:**

- Let's consider the sub-board that's still available after accounting for the occupied rows and columns.

- Each move I make will restrict future moves, both for me and the computer.

- The mirroring operation suggests that the board has a certain symmetry that we can exploit.

**Approach to Solution:**

I need to find a way to model the remaining game state and calculate the number of possible configurations from there.

One way to think about it is to consider the problem as placing non-attacking rooks on the remaining board, with the constraint that moves are mirrored across the diagonal, except for diagonal moves.

However, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

**Insight:**

- The problem has a recursive structure: after each pair of moves (mine and the computer's), the board state updates, and the game continues from there.

- But considering the potential size of n (up to 3*10^5), a recursive approach isn't feasible due to time and space constraints.

- I need a mathematical formula or a dynamic programming approach that can compute the number of configurations efficiently.

**Dynamic Programming Idea:**

Let's consider dp[m]: the number of ways to complete the game with m remaining degrees of freedom.

But I need to define what m represents.

**Defining dp[m]:**

- Let's think of m as the number of remaining rows (and columns) that are free.

- Each time I place a rook, I reduce the number of free rows and columns.

- If I place a rook at (r, c), where r != c, then both row r and column c are occupied, and the computer places at (c, r), occupying row c and column r.

- If r == c, then only row r and column c are occupied, and the computer skips.

- So, in the off-diagonal case, placing one pair (me and the computer) reduces m by 2.

- In the diagonal case, placing one rook reduces m by 1.

**Generalizing:**

- Suppose m is the number of free rows (which is equal to the number of free columns due to the nature of rook placements).

- Each off-diagonal move reduces m by 2.

- Each diagonal move reduces m by 1.

- The game continues until m = 0.

- I need to count the number of ways to reach m = 0, considering the constraints.

**Calculating the Remaining m:**

- Initially, m = n.

- For each of the k moves already made:

- If it's an off-diagonal move, m decreases by 2.

- If it's a diagonal move, m decreases by 1.

- So, after k moves, the remaining m can be calculated.

- Then, I need to find the number of ways to complete the game from this state.

**Formula for dp[m]:**

- dp[m] represents the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining m x m sub-board, considering the mirroring rule.

- I need to find a recurrence relation for dp[m].

**Recurrence Relation:**

- Consider that I can choose to place a rook in an off-diagonal position or on the diagonal.

- If I place a rook in an off-diagonal position (r, c), with r != c, then:

- The computer places at (c, r).

- This reduces m by 2.

- The number of ways to choose such a pair is m*(m-1), but since order doesn't matter, it's m*(m-1)/2.

- Wait, actually, since I'm placing at (r, c) and the computer at (c, r), and r != c, each such pair is unique.

- So, the number of possible off-diagonal moves is m*(m-1).

- Each off-diagonal move leads to dp[m-2].

- If I place a rook on the diagonal at (r, r), then:

- The computer skips.

- This reduces m by 1.

- The number of ways to choose such a move is m.

- Each diagonal move leads to dp[m-1].

- So, the total number of ways is:

dp[m] = (number of off-diagonal moves * dp[m-2]) + (number of diagonal moves * dp[m-1])

Which translates to:

dp[m] = (m * (m - 1) * dp[m - 2]) + (m * dp[m - 1])

But this seems off because in the off-diagonal case, I and the computer make a pair of moves, so it's one combined step reducing m by 2.

Similarly, in the diagonal case, I make a move and the computer skips, so it's one step reducing m by 1.

Wait, but in terms of counting configurations, it's about the positions occupied, not the sequence of moves.

Maybe I need to think differently.

**Alternative Approach:**

- Consider that the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining board, with the mirroring constraint.

- Given the mirroring, perhaps I can consider pairs of positions that are mirrors of each other.

- For off-diagonal positions, each pair (r, c) and (c, r) can be treated as a single entity.

- For diagonal positions (r, r), they are self-mirroring.

- So, perhaps I can model the remaining board as a graph where each off-diagonal pair is an edge, and each diagonal position is a self-loop.

- Then, placing a rook on an off-diagonal pair removes that edge and its corresponding rows and columns.

- Placing a rook on a diagonal position removes that self-loop and the corresponding row and column.

- This seems complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of combinations.

**Combinatorial Approach:**

- Suppose m is the number of free rows (and columns).

- I can choose to place rooks in off-diagonal pairs or on the diagonal.

- Each off-diagonal pair occupies two positions and reduces m by 2.

- Each diagonal placement occupies one position and reduces m by 1.

- The game continues until m = 0.

- This seems similar to partitioning m into parts of size 1 and 2.

- However, in this problem, the order of placements matters because the computer mirrors my moves.

- Wait, but in terms of configurations, the order doesn't matter; we just care about the final positions of rooks.

- So, perhaps it's a matter of counting the number of possible subsets of off-diagonal pairs and diagonal positions such that no two chosen elements conflict (i.e., no shared rows or columns).

- This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need a different angle.

**Insight from Symmetry:**

- The mirroring operation suggests that the board has a symmetry across the diagonal.

- Perhaps I can consider only one triangle of the board (upper or lower) and account for the diagonal separately.

- Wait, but the mirroring is across the main diagonal, so positions above the diagonal are mirrored to positions below, and positions on the diagonal are self-mirrored.

- So, maybe I can think in terms of choosing pairs from the upper triangle and the diagonal separately.

- But I'm not sure.

**Simplifying Assumption:**

- Let's assume that after the initial k moves, the remaining board can be treated as a new, smaller board of size m x m, where m is n reduced by the placements.

- I need to find dp[m], the number of ways to complete the game on an m x m board with no initial rooks.

- Then, the answer for the given state is dp[m], where m is n reduced by the k moves.

- So, I need to compute dp[m], and to do that, I need to find a way to compute dp[m] efficiently for any m.

**Computing dp[m]:**

- dp[0] = 1: there's one way to have an empty board.

- dp[1] = 1: place one rook on the diagonal or not, but considering the rules, it's a bit tricky.

- For m >= 2, dp[m] = dp[m-1] + (m-1)*dp[m-2]

- Wait, this resembles the recurrence for derangements or something similar.

- Let's verify this.

- If I place a rook on the diagonal at position (m, m), then the computer skips, and the remaining board is (m-1) x (m-1), leading to dp[m-1].

- If I place a rook off-diagonal, say at (m, c), with c < m, then the computer places at (c, m).

- This removes row m, column m, row c, and column c.

- So, the remaining board is (m-2) x (m-2), and there are (m-1) choices for c (since c can be from 1 to m-1).

- Therefore, dp[m] = dp[m-1] + (m-1)*dp[m-2]

- This seems plausible.

- Let's check for small m.

**Verification for Small m:**

- m = 0: dp[0] = 1

- m = 1: dp[1] = dp[0] + 0*dp[-1] = 1 + 0 = 1

- m = 2: dp[2] = dp[1] + 1*dp[0] = 1 + 1*1 = 2

- m = 3: dp[3] = dp[2] + 2*dp[1] = 2 + 2*1 = 4

- m = 4: dp[4] = dp[3] + 3*dp[2] = 4 + 3*2 = 10

- And so on.

- But let's see if this matches the first test case.

**First Test Case:**

- n = 4, k = 1, move: (1,2)

- So, I place at (1,2), computer places at (2,1).

- Now, rows 1 and 2 are occupied, so m = 4 - 2 = 2.

- According to dp[m]:

- dp[0] = 1

- dp[1] = 1

- dp[2] = 2

- dp[3] = 4

- dp[4] = 10

- But in the explanation, there are 3 possible configurations from this state.

- Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe my recurrence is wrong.

- Perhaps I need to adjust the recurrence.

**Revisiting the Recurrence:**

- Let's think differently.

- Each move I make can be either on the diagonal or off-diagonal.

- But in this problem, the moves are constrained by the mirroring rule.

- Maybe I should consider the number of ways to choose pairs of off-diagonal positions and single diagonal positions.

- Wait, perhaps inclusion of off-diagonal pairs and diagonal singles can be modeled using generating functions or something similar.

- This might be too complicated for practical implementation.

**Alternative Insight:**

- The problem is similar to counting the number of ways to choose a subset of positions to place rooks, with the constraints that no two rooks attack each other and considering the mirroring rule.

- This sounds like counting perfect matchings in a bipartite graph, but it's not exactly that.

- Maybe I need to model this as a graph where nodes represent rows (or columns), and edges represent possible placements.

- This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a pattern or a known sequence.

**Looking for a Pattern:**

- From the first test case, with m = 2, the number of configurations is 3.

- From dp[m]:

- dp[0] = 1

- dp[1] = 1

- dp[2] = 3

- dp[3] = 1 + 2*1 = 3 (but according to earlier calculation, dp[3] = 4)

- Wait, inconsistency here.

- Maybe my initial recurrence is incorrect.

**Correct Recurrence:**

- Let's try to derive the recurrence again.

- For dp[m]:

- If I place a rook on the diagonal at (m,m), then the computer skips, and the remaining board is (m-1)x(m-1), so dp[m-1].

- If I place a rook off-diagonal at (m,c), with c < m, then the computer places at (c,m), and the remaining board is (m-2)x(m-2), and there are (m-1) choices for c.

- So, dp[m] = dp[m-1] + (m-1)*dp[m-2]

- But in the first test case, with m=2, dp[2] = dp[1] + 1*dp[0] = 1 + 1*1 = 2, but the explanation says there are 3 configurations.

- Hmm, discrepancy here.

- Maybe I need to adjust the recurrence.

**Adjusting the Recurrence:**

- Perhaps I need to consider that placing an off-diagonal pair allows for two different orders: I place (m,c) and computer places (c,m), or I place (c,m) and computer places (m,c).

- But in reality, since I always place first, and the computer mirrors, each off-diagonal placement is a pair consisting of my move and the computer's move.

- So, perhaps for off-diagonal placements, it's better to think of selecting unordered pairs {r,c} where r != c.

- Wait, but in terms of moves, I choose (r,c), and the computer responds with (c,r).

- So, each off-diagonal move effectively occupies both (r,c) and (c,r).

- Therefore, selecting an off-diagonal pair reduces m by 2.

- Selecting a diagonal move reduces m by 1.

- So, the total number of configurations should be the sum over all possible numbers of off-diagonal pairs and diagonal singles, considering the reductions in m.

- This seems combinatorially complex.

**Another Angle:**

- Maybe I can think in terms of permutations, since rooks are placed without attacking each other, similar to permutation matrices.

- But the mirroring adds a twist.

- Perhaps I can consider derangements or fixed-point permutations.

- Not sure.

**Back to the First Test Case:**

- n=4, k=1, move: (1,2)

- After my move at (1,2), computer moves at (2,1).

- So, rows 1 and 2 are occupied.

- Remaining m = 4 - 2 = 2.

- According to the explanation, there are 3 possible configurations from this state.

- But according to dp[m] with dp[m] = dp[m-1] + (m-1)*dp[m-2], dp[2] = 2, which doesn't match.

- So, perhaps the recurrence is incorrect.

**Correcting the Recurrence:**

- Let's consider that for dp[m], the number of configurations is dp[m-1] + 2*(m-1)*dp[m-2]

- Wait, in the first test case, dp[2] = dp[1] + 2*1*dp[0] = 1 + 2*1*1 = 3, which matches the example.

- So, perhaps the correct recurrence is dp[m] = dp[m-1] + 2*(m-1)*dp[m-2]

- Let's check for m=3:

- dp[3] = dp[2] + 2*2*dp[1] = 3 + 4*1 = 7

- m=4:

- dp[4] = dp[3] + 2*3*dp[2] = 7 + 6*3 = 7 + 18 = 25

- But I need to verify if this makes sense.

- In the first test case, with m=2, dp[2]=3, which matches.

- So, perhaps this is the correct recurrence.

**Generalizing the Recurrence:**

- dp[m] = dp[m-1] + 2*(m-1)*dp[m-2]

- With base cases:

- dp[0] = 1

- dp[1] = 1

- This seems to fit the first test case.

- Let's see if it fits the second test case.

**Second Test Case:**

- n=8, k=1, move: (7,6)

- After my move at (7,6), computer moves at (6,7).

- Rows 6 and 7 are occupied.

- So, m = 8 - 2 = 6.

- According to dp[m]:

- dp[0] = 1

- dp[1] = 1

- dp[2] = 1 + 2*1*1 = 3

- dp[3] = 3 + 2*2*1 = 7

- dp[4] = 7 + 2*3*3 = 7 + 18 = 25

- dp[5] = 25 + 2*4*7 = 25 + 56 = 81

- dp[6] = 81 + 2*5*25 = 81 + 250 = 331

- Which matches the second test case output: 331

- Good, seems consistent.

**Third Test Case:**

- n=1000, k=4, moves: (4,4), (952,343), (222,333), (90,91)

- For (4,4): diagonal move, m reduces by 1.

- For (952,343): off-diagonal, m reduces by 2.

- For (222,333): off-diagonal, m reduces by 2.

- For (90,91): off-diagonal, m reduces by 2.

- Total reduction: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7

- So, m = 1000 - 7 = 993

- Compute dp[993]

- Given the large value of m, I need an efficient way to compute dp[m], up to m=3*10^5

- So, I need a dynamic programming approach that can handle large m efficiently.

- Since m can be up to 3*10^5, and t can be up to 10^4, I need to precompute dp[m] for all m up to 3*10^5 and then answer each test case quickly.

- But precomputing dp[m] up to 3*10^5 is feasible, as it's a simple loop.

**Implementing the Solution:**

- Precompute dp[m] for m from 0 to 3*10^5.

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- For each of the k moves:

- If r != c, m reduces by 2.

- If r == c, m reduces by 1.

- Compute the remaining m.

- Output dp[m] modulo 10^9 + 7.

- Given that, the provided code seems to implement this logic.

- In the code:

- Read t.

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- For each of k moves:

- Read r and c.

- If r != c, n -= 2

- Else, n -=1

- Then, print func_1(n)

- func_1 computes dp[m] using a loop.

- This seems correct, given our earlier reasoning.

**Verifying the Code:**

- The function func_1 computes dp[m] using the recurrence dp[m] = dp[m-1] + 2*(m-1)*dp[m-2], modulo 10^9 + 7.

- It uses a list dp with two elements initialized to 1, and iteratively computes up to dp[n].

- This matches our derived recurrence.

- In the main loop:

- For each test case, read n and k.

- For each of k moves, read r and c.

- If r != c, subtract 2 from n.

- Else, subtract 1 from n.

- Then, compute func_1(n)

- This seems accurate.

- However, there might be an issue with variable naming: n is used for both the board size and the remaining degrees of freedom.

- It's better to use a different variable for the remaining m to avoid confusion.

- But in terms of logic, it's correct.

**Potential Optimizations:**

- Since m can be up to 3*10^5, and t up to 10^4, precomputing dp[m] once and then answering each test case in O(1) is efficient.

- The provided code seems to handle this correctly.

**Conclusion:**

- The given program correctly implements the solution based on the derived recurrence relation and handles the test cases efficiently.

- Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
