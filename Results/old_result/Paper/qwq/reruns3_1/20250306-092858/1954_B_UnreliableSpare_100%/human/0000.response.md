Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a beautiful array, and I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that it's no longer beautiful. Or output -1 if it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what makes an array beautiful. According to the problem, an array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by using a specific operation any number of times. The operation is: choose an index i (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a[i - 1] = a[i + 1], and replace a[i] with a[i - 1].

So, in other words, if the elements on both sides of an element are equal, you can change that element to match them. This operation can be repeated as many times as needed.

The goal is to make all elements equal using these operations. The problem assures me that the given array is beautiful, so it's possible to make all elements equal using these operations.

Now, I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array is no longer beautiful, meaning it's impossible to make all elements equal using those operations.

Let me think about what makes an array not beautiful. If, after removals, the array cannot be transformed into an array where all elements are equal using those operations, then it's not beautiful.

First, consider the simplest case: an array with all elements already equal. No matter how many elements you remove, it remains beautiful because all elements are already equal. So, for such arrays, it's impossible to make them not beautiful by removing elements. Hence, the answer is -1 for such cases.

Next, consider arrays where not all elements are equal. In these cases, it might be possible to make them not beautiful by removing certain elements.

I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to achieve that.

Looking at the example:

Input:

4

3

2 2 2

5

1 2 1 2 1

1

1

7

3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output:

-1

1

-1

3

In the first test case, all elements are 2, so it's already beautiful and remains beautiful no matter how many elements you remove. Hence, -1.

In the second test case, removing one element can make it not beautiful.

In the third test case, there's only one element, which is already beautiful, and removing it would make the array empty, which might be considered not beautiful, but according to the problem, n >=1, so perhaps empty array is not considered. Need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says "swap is prohibited", but doesn't specify about empty arrays. Probably, removing all elements is not allowed, as n >=1.

Wait, n is the length of the array, and it's given that n >=1, but after removals, if n becomes 0, it's likely not allowed. So, probably, for n=1, it's -1 because it's already beautiful and can't remove the only element.

Wait, in the third test case, n=1, and the output is -1, which aligns with this.

In the fourth test case, removing the first three elements results in [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

So, I need a general approach to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

Let me think about the properties of a beautiful array.

Given that the operation allows changing a[i] to a[i-1] if a[i-1] == a[i+1], and this can be done repeatedly, it suggests that sequences with certain patterns can be made uniform.

I need to find a way to break this uniformity by removing the least number of elements.

One way to approach this is to identify the minimal number of removals that disrupt the ability to make all elements equal via the allowed operations.

Perhaps, focusing on the runs of identical elements could help.

Let's consider that in a beautiful array, you can propagate values through such operations, making long sequences uniform.

If I have a sequence like 1,2,1,2,1, as in the second test case, removing one element can break the pattern.

Wait, in that case, removing the last element makes it [1,2,1,2], which cannot be made uniform.

Let me see why.

If I have [1,2,1,2], possible operations:

- Choose i=2: a[1]=1, a[3]=1, so replace a[2]=2 with 1, resulting in [1,1,1,2]. From here, I can choose i=4: a[3]=1, a[5]=nothing (out of bounds), so no operation possible. This leaves [1,1,1,2], which is not uniform.

- Alternatively, choose i=3: a[2]=1, a[4]=2, which are different, so no operation possible.

Hence, it's not possible to make all elements equal, so the array is not beautiful.

So, by removing one element, I can make the array not beautiful.

Now, how to generalize this?

I need to find the smallest number of removals that prevent the array from being made uniform via the allowed operations.

One idea is to look for the minimal number of removals to break all possible paths of equal elements that could be propagated.

Alternatively, perhaps finding the smallest subset of elements whose removal leads to the array no longer being beautiful.

Another approach is to consider that if the array has multiple distinct runs, and removing certain elements can isolate these runs in a way that propagation can't统一 all elements.

But this seems a bit vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array where all elements are equal. Then, it's always beautiful, and removing elements won't make it not beautiful, as any subarray with all elements equal is still beautiful.

Hence, for such arrays, the answer is -1.

If the array has at least two different elements, then perhaps there is a way to make it not beautiful by removing some elements.

Now, in the program provided, it seems to handle these cases.

Let me look at the code.

In func_1:

- Read n and the array.

- Check if all elements are equal. If yes, print -1.

- Else, find the minimum length of a run of the first element's value.

- Print this minimum run length.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Looking at the code:

flag = True

for i in range(1, n):

if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:

flag = False

break

If all elements are equal, flag remains True, and it prints -1.

Else, it computes ans as infinity.

Then, it sets val to arr[0] and cnt to 0.

Then, iterates through the array:

if arr[i] == val:

cnt +=1

else:

ans = min(ans, cnt)

cnt =0

Finally, ans = min(ans, cnt)

Then, print(ans)

Wait, this seems to find the minimum length of consecutive runs of the first element.

Is this correct?

Let me see.

In the second test case:

5

1 2 1 2 1

val =1

cnt increases for the first 1, then resets when it sees 2, then increases for 1, then resets for 2, then increases for 1.

ans would be the minimum of these cnt values.

Wait, no.

Wait, cnt increases only when arr[i] == val.

val is 1.

So:

i=0: arr[0]==1, cnt=1

i=1: arr[1]==2 !=1, ans=min(inf,1), cnt=0

i=2: arr[2]==1, cnt=1

i=3: arr[3]==2 !=1, ans=min(1,1), cnt=0

i=4: arr[4]==1, cnt=1

Finally, ans=min(1,1)=1

So, it prints 1, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case:

7

3 3 3 5 3 3 3

val=3

cnt=3 (for first three 3's)

then arr[3]=5 !=3, ans=min(inf,3), cnt=0

then arr[4]=3, cnt=1

arr[5]=3, cnt=2

arr[6]=3, cnt=3

finally, ans=min(3,3)=3

Which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

But is this logic generally correct?

Let me think.

The idea seems to be that the minimal number of removals needed to make the array not beautiful is equal to the minimal run length of the first element's value.

Wait, why is that?

Wait, perhaps the logic is to find the smallest number of elements to remove to break the propagation of the first element's value through the array.

By finding the smallest run of the first element, removing that run would prevent the propagation of that value through the array.

Hence, making it impossible to make all elements equal to that value.

But, wait, the array might be made beautiful with a different target value.

For example, in the array [1,2,1,2,1], if we try to make all elements 2, but it's impossible because there are more 1's.

Wait, in that case, the minimal run of 1's is 1, and removing one 1 would break the ability to make all elements 1.

Hence, it seems to make sense.

Another example: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1]

val=1

cnt=2, then resets when sees 2, then cnt=0 for 2's, then cnt=3 for 2's, then resets to 0, then cnt=2 for 1's.

ans=min(2,3,2)=2

So, it would output 2.

Is that correct?

Let's see.

Original array: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1]

If I remove two elements, say the first two 1's, resulting in [2,2,2,1,1]

This is still beautiful because I can make all elements 2 by operations.

Alternatively, remove two 2's, say the first two 2's, resulting in [1,1,2,2,1,1]

Is this beautiful?

Can I make all elements equal?

Let's try to make all elements 1.

Starting with [1,1,2,2,1,1]

Operation on i=3: a[2]=1, a[4]=2 != a[2], so no operation.

Operation on i=4: a[3]=2, a[5]=1 != a[3], so no operation.

So, no operations can be performed, and the array is not uniform. Hence, not beautiful.

So, removing two elements can make it not beautiful.

Hence, the output of 2 seems correct.

Another test case: [1,2,3,4,5]

All elements different.

val=1

cnt=1

ans=min(inf,1)=1

Then, cnt resets for each element.

Final ans=1

Which is correct because removing one element can make it not beautiful.

Wait, but in this case, is the array beautiful?

Given that all elements are different, can I make them all equal?

Well, since the array is beautiful as per the problem's assurance, but in reality, for such an array, it's impossible to make all elements equal because there are no positions where operations can be performed (since a[i-1] != a[i+1] for all i).

Hence, it's already not beautiful, which contradicts the problem's assurance that all given arrays are beautiful.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers such arrays beautiful because no operations are needed if the array is already uniform.

But in this case, the array is not uniform, and operations can't be performed, so it's not beautiful.

Wait, maybe the problem considers that if no operations can be performed, and the array is not uniform, it's still considered not beautiful.

But according to the problem statement, a beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by using the operations zero or more times.

So, if no operations can be performed, and the array is not uniform, it's not beautiful.

Hence, in such cases, the array is not beautiful, which contradicts the problem's assurance that the given array is beautiful.

Hence, perhaps the problem considers that such arrays are not beautiful, but according to the problem statement, all given arrays are beautiful.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says: "the given array a is beautiful". So, I don't need to check if it's beautiful or not; I have to assume it is and find the minimal number of removals to make it not beautiful.

But in the above example, [1,2,3,4,5] seems not beautiful, which contradicts the problem's assurance.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that even if no operations can be performed, if the array is already uniform, it's beautiful.

Wait, but in [1,2,3,4,5], it's not uniform, and no operations can be performed, so it's not beautiful.

But according to the problem, it's given that the array is beautiful, so perhaps such arrays won't be provided.

Hence, perhaps I can assume that the given arrays are beautiful, and I need to find the minimal removals to make them not beautiful.

Back to the program, it seems to work correctly for the sample inputs.

But is this logic generally correct?

Let me consider another test case.

Test case:

4

1 1 2 1

According to the program:

val=1

cnt=2 (first two 1's)

then arr[2]=2 !=1, ans=min(inf,2)=2

then arr[3]=1, cnt=1

final ans=min(2,1)=1

So, it outputs 1.

Is that correct?

Let's see.

If I remove one element, say the third element 2, resulting in [1,1,1], which is beautiful.

Alternatively, remove one of the 1's, say the first one, resulting in [1,2,1]

This is still beautiful because I can perform operations to make all elements 1.

Wait, choose i=2: a[1]=1, a[3]=1, so replace a[2]=1, resulting in [1,1,1].

Hence, still beautiful.

Wait, seems like removing one element doesn't make it not beautiful.

Need to remove at least two elements.

For example, remove the first and third elements, resulting in [1,2], which is not beautiful.

Hence, the minimal number should be 2, but the program outputs 1, which is incorrect.

Wait, this contradicts the program's output.

Hence, the program seems to be incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the program's logic, it finds the minimal run length of the first element, which is 1 in this case (the last element is 1, cnt=1), and outputs 1, but in reality, removing one element isn't enough to make it not beautiful.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier test cases, it seemed correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the logic.

Alternative approach:

Maybe the minimal number of removals is equal to the minimal frequency of any value in the array.

Wait, no.

Consider the array [1,2,1,2,1], n=5.

Frequencies: 1 appears 3 times, 2 appears 2 times.

Removing one 1 would make it [2,1,2,1], which is still beautiful.

Because you can perform operations to make all elements 2 or 1.

Wait, but according to the sample output, removing one element is enough, but in this case, it seems not sufficient.

Wait, in the second test case, the program outputs 1, but according to the explanation, removing one element can make it not beautiful.

Wait, perhaps I need to see which element to remove carefully.

In the second test case, [1,2,1,2,1], removing the last element makes it [1,2,1,2], which is not beautiful, as shown in the explanation.

Hence, removing one element can suffice.

In my previous test case, [1,1,2,1], removing one element isn't enough, but according to the program, it outputs 1, which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the program is correct for some cases but not all.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Looking back at the program, it finds the minimal run length of the first element.

In the second test case, runs of 1 are of lengths 1,1,1.

Hence, ans=1.

In the fourth test case, runs of 3 are of lengths 3 and 3.

Hence, ans=3.

In my test case, [1,1,2,1], runs of 1 are of lengths 2 and 1.

Hence, ans=1.

But in reality, removing one element isn't enough to make it not beautiful.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct minimal number of removals is the minimal run length among all runs of the most frequent element.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternative idea:

Consider that to make the array not beautiful, we need to prevent any sequence of operations from making all elements equal.

One way to do this is to ensure that no single value can be propagated throughout the entire array via the allowed operations.

Hence, we need to remove elements in such a way that no value can span the entire array with the given operations.

This seems complex.

An alternative simpler approach might be to find the minimal number of removals to make the array not uniform, and such that no operations can make it uniform.

But this needs more thought.

Perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal number of removals to break all possible paths of equal elements that could be used to propagate a value across the array.

This sounds similar to breaking connectivity in a graph where edges exist between elements that are equal and adjacent.

But I need a more concrete algorithm.

Given time constraints, I'll conclude that the provided program is incorrect, at least in some cases, as shown by my counterexample.

Hence, Correctness: **False**
