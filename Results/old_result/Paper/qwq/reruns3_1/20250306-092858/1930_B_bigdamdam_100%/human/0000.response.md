Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation p of length n such that there don't exist two distinct indices i and j (where 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. From the problem, it says that a permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not because 2 appears twice, and [1,3,4] is not a permutation of n=3 because it includes 4, which is outside the range.

So, for a given n, I need to arrange the numbers from 1 to n in some order, but with the condition that no two pairs (i, j) and (i+1, j+1) have p_i dividing p_j and p_{i+1} dividing p_{j+1}.

Let me try to understand this condition better. It's saying that for any two positions i and j, if p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}, then this permutation is invalid. I need to make sure that this situation doesn't occur in my permutation.

The problem also mentions that for n=4, the permutation [4,1,2,3] is valid, but [1,2,3,4] is invalid because p1=1 divides p3=3 and p2=2 divides p4=4. Another invalid permutation is [3,4,2,1] because p3=2 divides p2=4 and p4=1 divides p3=2.

So, I need to find a way to arrange the numbers from 1 to n such that this condition is never met.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One idea is to arrange the numbers in such a way that adjacent numbers don't have a dividing relationship that could be matched elsewhere in the permutation.

The given code seems to be attempting to construct such a permutation by first filling the even indices with descending high numbers and then filling the odd indices with ascending low numbers.

Let me look at the code step by step.

The function func() is defined, and it seems to handle multiple test cases, as indicated by the input format.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t, from input.

Then, for each test case:

- It reads n from input.

- Initializes a list p of size n with zeros.

- Sets ind to n.

- Fills the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) with decreasing even numbers starting from n, stepping down by 2 each time.

- Then, sets ind to 1 if n is even, or to 2 if n is odd.

- Fills the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) with increasing odd numbers starting from ind, stepping up by 2 each time.

Finally, it prints the permutation p for each test case.

Wait, actually, looking back at the code:

p = [0] * n

ind = n

for i in range(0, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind -= 2

ind = 1 + n % 2

for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

So, for even indices, it's filling them with numbers starting from n and decreasing by 2 each time.

For odd indices, it's filling them with numbers starting from 1 if n is even, or 2 if n is odd, and increasing by 2 each time.

Let me see an example.

Take n=4.

For even indices (0 and 2):

p[0] = 4

ind = 4 - 2 = 2

p[2] = 2

Then, ind = 1 + 4 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1

p[1] = 1

ind = 1 + 2 = 3

p[3] = 3

So, p = [4,1,2,3]

Which matches the first example given in the problem.

Another example, n=3.

Even indices: p[0] = 3, ind = 3 - 2 = 1, p[2] = 1

ind = 1 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

p[1] = 2

So, p = [3,2,1]

But according to the note, [1,2,3] is a valid permutation, but [3,2,1] should also be valid, as long as no such i and j exist.

Wait, but in the note, it says that for n=3, all 6 permutations are valid. So, [3,2,1] should be fine.

Let me check if there are any i and j where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

For i=1, j=2: p1=3 divides p2=2? No, 3 doesn't divide 2.

i=1, j=3: p1=3 divides p3=1? Yes, 3 divides 1? No, 3 doesn't divide 1.

i=2, j=3: p2=2 divides p3=1? Yes, 2 divides 1? No, 2 doesn't divide 1.

So, no such i and j exist, hence [3,2,1] is valid.

Another test case, n=5.

p[0] = 5, ind = 5 - 2 = 3, p[2] = 3, ind = 3 - 2 = 1, p[4] =1

Then, ind =1 +5%2=1+1=2

p[1]=2, ind=2+2=4, p[3]=4

So, p=[5,2,3,4,1]

Let's check if this is valid.

Check all possible i and j pairs where 1 ≤ i,j <5 and i≠j.

For i=1,j=2: p1=5 divides p2=2? No.

i=1,j=3: p1=5 divides p3=3? No.

i=1,j=4: p1=5 divides p4=4? No.

i=2,j=3: p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

i=2,j=4: p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes, and p3=3 divides p5=1? No, 3 doesn't divide 1.

So, this pair doesn't violate the condition.

i=3,j=4: p3=3 divides p4=4? No.

So, this permutation seems valid.

Another example, n=6.

p[0]=6, ind=6-2=4, p[2]=4, ind=4-2=2, p[4]=2

Then, ind=1 + 6%2=1+0=1

p[1]=1, ind=1+2=3, p[3]=3, ind=3+2=5, p[5]=5

So, p=[6,1,4,3,2,5]

Check for validity.

i=1,j=2: p1=6 divides p2=1? No.

i=1,j=3: p1=6 divides p3=4? Yes, 6 divides 4? No.

i=1,j=4: p1=6 divides p4=3? Yes, 6 divides 3? No.

i=1,j=5: p1=6 divides p5=2? Yes, 6 divides 2? No.

i=2,j=3: p2=1 divides p3=4? Yes, and p3=4 divides p4=3? No.

i=2,j=4: p2=1 divides p4=3? Yes, and p3=4 divides p5=2? No.

i=2,j=5: p2=1 divides p5=2? Yes, and p3=4 divides p6=5? No.

i=3,j=4: p3=4 divides p4=3? No.

i=3,j=5: p3=4 divides p5=2? Yes, 4 divides 2? Yes, and p4=3 divides p6=5? No.

So, even though p3=4 divides p5=2, p4=3 does not divide p6=5, so it's okay.

i=4,j=5: p4=3 divides p5=2? No.

So, this permutation seems valid.

Seems like the code is constructing permutations that are valid according to the problem's condition.

But I need to think if this method will always produce a valid permutation for any n within the given constraints.

Let me think about how this construction works.

It places the largest numbers in the even indices (0-based), decreasing by 2 each time.

Then, it places the smallest numbers in the odd indices, increasing by 2 each time.

This seems to separate the smaller numbers from the larger ones in a way that makes it less likely for p_i to divide p_j and p_{i+1} to divide p_{j+1}.

But I need to think if there could be any n where this construction fails.

Let me consider n=7.

p[0]=7, ind=7-2=5, p[2]=5, ind=5-2=3, p[4]=3, ind=3-2=1, p[6]=1

Then, ind=1 + 7%2=1+1=2

p[1]=2, ind=2+2=4, p[3]=4, ind=4+2=6, but since n=7, p[5]=6

So, p=[7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Check for validity.

Let's check some pairs.

i=1,j=2: p1=7 divides p2=2? No.

i=1,j=3: p1=7 divides p3=5? No.

i=1,j=4: p1=7 divides p4=4? No.

i=1,j=5: p1=7 divides p5=3? No.

i=1,j=6: p1=7 divides p6=6? No.

i=2,j=3: p2=2 divides p3=5? No.

i=2,j=4: p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes, and p3=5 divides p5=3? No.

i=2,j=5: p2=2 divides p5=3? No.

i=2,j=6: p2=2 divides p6=6? Yes, and p3=5 divides p7=1? No.

i=3,j=4: p3=5 divides p4=4? No.

i=3,j=5: p3=5 divides p5=3? No.

i=3,j=6: p3=5 divides p6=6? No.

i=4,j=5: p4=4 divides p5=3? No.

i=4,j=6: p4=4 divides p6=6? Yes, and p5=3 divides p7=1? Yes, 3 divides 1? No.

i=5,j=6: p5=3 divides p6=6? Yes, and p6=6 divides p7=1? No.

So, no invalid pairs exist.

Seems fine.

Is there any n where this construction would fail?

Let me think about smaller n.

n=3: p=[3,2,1], which is valid.

n=4: p=[4,1,2,3], valid.

n=5: p=[5,2,3,4,1], valid.

n=6: p=[6,1,4,3,2,5], valid.

n=7: p=[7,2,5,4,3,6,1], valid.

Seems consistent.

But to be thorough, let's consider n=2.

Wait, but the problem says 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, so n=2 is not considered.

But just for curiosity.

For n=2:

p[0]=2, ind=2-2=0, but ind should be positive, so maybe the construction breaks.

But since n >=3, it's fine.

Another thing to consider is whether the permutation generated actually contains all numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

In the construction:

- Even indices: starting from n, decrement by 2 each time.

- Odd indices: starting from 1 + n%2, increment by 2 each time.

For n=4: [4,1,2,3] - all numbers from 1 to 4 are present.

n=5: [5,2,3,4,1] - all numbers from 1 to 5 are present.

n=6: [6,1,4,3,2,5] - all numbers from 1 to 6 are present.

n=7: [7,2,5,4,3,6,1] - all numbers from 1 to 7 are present.

Seems correct.

Is there any n where this construction would miss a number or repeat a number?

Let me think about n=8.

p[0]=8, ind=8-2=6, p[2]=6, ind=6-2=4, p[4]=4, ind=4-2=2, p[6]=2

Then, ind=1 + 8%2=1+0=1

p[1]=1, ind=1+2=3, p[3]=3, ind=3+2=5, p[5]=5, ind=5+2=7, p[7]=7

So, p=[8,1,6,3,4,5,2,7]

Check if all numbers from 1 to 8 are present: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 - yes.

Another check for n=9.

p[0]=9, ind=9-2=7, p[2]=7, ind=7-2=5, p[4]=5, ind=5-2=3, p[6]=3, ind=3-2=1, p[8]=1

Then, ind=1 + 9%2=1+1=2

p[1]=2, ind=2+2=4, p[3]=4, ind=4+2=6, p[5]=6, ind=6+2=8, p[7]=8

So, p=[9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1]

All numbers from 1 to 9 are present.

Looks good.

Now, I need to confirm that this construction ensures that no two pairs (i,j) exist where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

I haven't found any counterexample yet, and the examples provided in the problem are satisfied.

Moreover, the problem states that at least one such permutation exists under the given constraints, so this construction seems to be a valid approach.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correct}}\]
