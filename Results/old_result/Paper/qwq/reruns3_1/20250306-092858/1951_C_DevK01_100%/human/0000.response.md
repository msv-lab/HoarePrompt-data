Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the array a_i. I need to buy exactly k tickets, and there's a limit of m tickets I can buy per day. Also, there's this rule that if I buy x tickets on a day, the price per ticket increases by x for all the subsequent days.

Okay, so my goal is to minimize the total cost of buying k tickets, considering these constraints.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's look at the example to get a better grasp.

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 3

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

The optimal way is to buy 0 tickets on the first two days, then 1 ticket on the third day, and 2 tickets on the fourth day, totaling 3 tickets with a cost of 10.

Wait, but according to the problem, if you buy x tickets on day i, the price per ticket increases by x for all subsequent days.

So, if I buy 0 on day 1, prices remain the same for the next days.

Then, buy 0 on day 2, prices still remain the same.

Then, buy 1 on day 3, cost is 4, and prices for day 4 increase by 1, so it becomes 2 + 1 = 3.

Then, buy 2 on day 4 at price 3 each, costing 6.

Total cost is 4 + 6 = 10, which matches the example.

Another test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 8

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

Here, the only way is to buy 2 tickets each day, and with the increasing prices, the total cost is 64.

Okay, so I need to find a strategy to minimize the total cost.

Let me think about the general approach.

I have n days, each with a price a_i.

I can buy up to m tickets per day.

I need to buy exactly k tickets.

Each time I buy x tickets on day i, the price per ticket increases by x for all subsequent days.

So, the cost on day i depends on the number of tickets bought on that day and the cumulative increase from previous days.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I need to decide how many tickets to buy on each day to minimize the total cost.

But dynamic programming might be too slow because n can be up to 3*10^5, which is 300,000, and t can be up to 10^4, which is 10,000. So, total time complexity needs to be O(t * n * something), but that something needs to be small.

Wait, but O(t * n) is already 3*10^9 operations, which is too much. So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I decide to buy a certain number of tickets on certain days. The cost on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for all j < i, where x_j is the number of tickets bought on day j.

Wait, more formally, the price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I buy x_i tickets on day i, the cost for those tickets is x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j).

And I need to choose x_i for each i such that sum x_i = k, with x_i <= m for each i.

I need to minimize the total cost, which is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j).

This seems like a complicated expression to minimize directly.

Maybe I can rearrange it.

Let me denote s_i = sum_{j=1}^i x_j, so s_i is the cumulative number of tickets bought up to day i.

Then, x_i = s_i - s_{i-1}, with s_0 = 0.

So, the total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) = sum_{i=1}^n (s_i - s_{i-1}) * (a_i + s_{i-1}).

Let's expand this:

= sum_{i=1}^n (s_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) - s_{i-1} * (a_i + s_{i-1}))

= sum_{i=1}^n (s_i * a_i + s_i * s_{i-1} - s_{i-1} * a_i - s_{i-1}^2)

This seems messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that the price increase is cumulative based on the total tickets bought earlier.

So, perhaps I should prioritize buying tickets on days with lower a_i, but considering the increasing prices afterward.

Wait, maybe I should think about sorting the days based on their a_i values.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i. Then, I can decide to buy tickets on the days with the lowest a_i first, but considering that doing so will increase the prices for subsequent days.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider buying tickets on the days with the lowest a_i + the cumulative increase up to that day.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a greedy approach: always buy as many tickets as possible on the day with the lowest current price.

But the current price changes based on previous purchases.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a priority queue, where I always pick the day with the current lowest price, buy as many tickets as possible, and then update the prices for subsequent days.

But with n up to 3*10^5, this approach would be too slow for the time constraints.

I need a more efficient method.

Let me think about the impact of buying x tickets on a particular day.

If I buy x tickets on day i, the cost is x * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j), and it increases the price for all subsequent days by x.

So, the total cost can be expressed in terms of the cumulative sum of tickets bought earlier.

This seems like a cumulative effect that might be amenable to prefix sums or similar techniques.

Wait, maybe I can precompute the total increase in price for each day based on the number of tickets bought earlier.

Let me denote s = sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j, which is the total tickets bought before day i.

Then, the price on day i is a_i + s.

So, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s).

And s for day i+1 is s + x_i.

So, it's a chain where each x_i affects the prices for all subsequent days.

I need to minimize sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j).

This seems like a minimization problem with cumulative variables.

Maybe I can model this with some kind of cumulative cost function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each ticket bought on day i contributes a cost of a_i plus the number of days remaining (including day i).

Wait, that might be promising.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I buy a ticket on day i.

The cost for that ticket is a_i plus the number of tickets I've already bought on previous days.

Because each ticket bought earlier increases the price by 1 for all subsequent tickets.

So, the cost for a ticket bought on day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on days 1 through i-1.

So, if I denote s_{i-1} as the total tickets bought on days 1 through i-1, then the cost for a ticket on day i is a_i + s_{i-1}.

Therefore, if I buy x_i tickets on day i, the cost is x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}).

And s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i.

So, the total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}).

I need to minimize this total cost, given that sum_{i=1}^n x_i = k and x_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a problem that can be optimized by choosing the order of days wisely.

Perhaps I should sort the days based on their a_i values, considering the cumulative s_{i-1}.

Wait, but s_{i-1} depends on the choices made for previous days.

This seems recursive.

Maybe I can use dynamic programming where the state is the current day and the total number of tickets bought so far.

But with n up to 3*10^5 and k up to 10^9, that's not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the increase in price for future days is directly proportional to the number of tickets bought today.

So, buying a ticket today not only costs a_i + s_{i-1} but also increases the cost of all future tickets by 1.

So, each ticket bought today effectively increases the cost of all future tickets.

This suggests that it's better to buy tickets on days with lower a_i first, but considering the impact on future days.

Wait, maybe I can model this as follows:

Each ticket bought on day i costs a_i + s_{i-1} + (n - i), because it increases the price for the remaining n - i days.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me think again.

Each ticket bought on day i increases the price for the remaining n - i days by 1.

So, the total additional cost caused by buying one ticket on day i is the sum over the remaining days of the increase in price per ticket.

But actually, it's not that complicated.

Each ticket bought on day i increases the price for all remaining days by 1, meaning that for each future day j > i, the price increases by 1 for each ticket bought on day i.

So, the total additional cost caused by buying one ticket on day i is equal to the number of remaining days (n - i), because each of those days has their price increased by 1.

Wait, but that's not entirely accurate.

Because the number of tickets bought on future days will determine how much extra is paid due to the increase.

But actually, since the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets bought earlier, it's more about the cumulative effect.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to find a mathematical expression for the total cost.

Total cost = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

Let me denote s_i = sum_{j=1}^i x_j, with s_0 = 0.

Then, the total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1}

Note that s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i.

Wait, s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i is not correct.

Actually, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i, so s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i.

But that might not help directly.

Alternatively, let's look at the total cost in terms of s_i.

sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (s_i - x_i)

= sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_i - sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Wait, maybe I can think of s_i as a prefix sum and find a way to minimize this expression.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m.

Then, the total cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

Let me denote s_i = sum_{j=1}^i x_j, so s_i is the cumulative sum up to day i.

Then, the cost is sum_{i=1}^n x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1}

But s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i, which might not help directly.

Wait, perhaps I can express the total cost in terms of s_i.

Let's try:

sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n x_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n (s_i - s_{i-1}) * s_{i-1}

= sum_{i=1}^n x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1}^n (s_i * s_{i-1} - s_{i-1}^2)

This seems messy.

Maybe I need to consider a different perspective.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as the sum over all tickets of the price they are bought at, considering the increases due to previous tickets.

So, if I think of each ticket individually, the cost of the p-th ticket is the price on the day it's bought plus the number of tickets bought before it.

Wait, that might be a way to model it.

Suppose I number the tickets from 1 to k, each assigned to a specific day.

The cost of the p-th ticket is a_{d_p} + (sum of x_j for j < d_p), where d_p is the day the p-th ticket is bought.

So, total cost is sum_{p=1}^k (a_{d_p} + sum_{j=1}^{d_p - 1} x_j)

This seems similar to what I had before.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a way to choose which days to buy tickets on, considering the increasing prices.

Perhaps I can sort the days based on their a_i values and decide how many tickets to buy on each day in a way that minimizes the total cost.

Wait, but I need to consider that buying on a day with a lower a_i might be better, but the increase in prices for future days could make it more expensive in the long run.

This seems like a trade-off.

Maybe I can group the days in a way that minimizes the overall cost.

Let me consider that if I buy x tickets on day i, the cost is x * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j), and then the prices increase by x for all subsequent days.

So, the a_j for j > i become a_j + x.

So, if I buy x tickets on day i, it affects the a_j for j > i by adding x to them.

This is similar to having a prefix add operation.

Maybe I can model this with a segment tree or some kind of prefix sum structure.

But I need a more efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that the total cost is the sum over all tickets of the price on the day they are bought, plus the sum over all pairs of tickets (earlier ticket and later ticket) of 1, because each earlier ticket increases the price of all later tickets by 1.

Wait, that might be a way to think about it.

So, total cost = sum over all tickets of a_{d_p} + sum over all pairs (p, q) with p < q of 1

But sum over all pairs (p, q) with p < q is simply C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2

So, total cost = sum over all tickets of a_{d_p} + k*(k-1)/2

Wait, that seems too simple.

But let's verify it with the first example.

n=4, m=2, k=3, a=[8,6,4,2]

sum of a_{d_p} for d_p being the days chosen: suppose d_p are days 3 and 4 with x_3=1 and x_4=2, so sum is 4 + 2*2 = 8

Then, k*(k-1)/2 = 3*2/2 = 3

Total cost would be 8 + 3 = 11, but in the example, it's 10.

So, that doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the sum over all pairs is not just k*(k-1)/2, but rather sum over all pairs (p,q) with p < q of x_p.

Because each ticket bought earlier increases the price of all later tickets by 1, so the total additional cost is sum over p < q of x_p.

So, total cost = sum over p=1 to k of a_{d_p} + sum over p < q of x_p

In the first example, suppose x_3=1 and x_4=2.

Then, sum over p < q of x_p is x_3 * x_4 = 1 * 2 = 2

So, total cost is 4 + 2*2 + 2 = 10, which matches the example.

Wait, that seems promising.

So, total cost = sum over p=1 to k of a_{d_p} + sum over p < q of x_p

But I need to confirm this.

In the second example:

n=4, m=2, k=8, a=[8,6,4,2]

Buy 2 on day1: cost 2*8=16, increase by 2 for next days

Buy 2 on day2: cost 2*(6+2)=16, increase by 2 for next days

Buy 2 on day3: cost 2*(4+4)=16, increase by 2 for next day

Buy 2 on day4: cost 2*(2+6)=16

Total cost 64.

Now, according to my formula:

sum over p=1 to 8 of a_{d_p} + sum over p < q of x_p

sum a_{d_p}: 2*8 + 2*(6+2) + 2*(4+4) + 2*(2+6) = 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 64

sum over p < q of x_p: with x=2 for each day, and k=8, it's C(4,2)*2*2 = 6*4 = 24

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in interpreting the formula.

Let me think again.

If I have x_i tickets bought on day i, then the total additional cost due to these tickets is x_i * (sum of x_j for j > i)

Because each ticket bought on day i increases the price for all future tickets by 1.

So, total additional cost is sum over i=1 to n of x_i * (sum over j=i+1 to n of x_j)

Which is sum over all pairs (i,j) with i < j of x_i

Which is indeed sum over p < q of x_p

But in the first example, with x_3=1 and x_4=2, sum over p < q of x_p = x_3*x_4 = 1*2 = 2, which matches.

In the second example, with x=2 for each day, sum over p < q of x_p = C(4,2)*2*2 = 6*4 = 24

But according to the direct calculation, total cost is 64, while sum a_{d_p} would be 16*4=64, and sum over p < q of x_p is 24, which would make total cost 64 + 24 = 88, which doesn't match the actual cost of 64.

So, my formula seems incorrect.

I must have miscounted something.

Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the additional cost is not sum over p < q of x_p, but sum over p < q of x_p * x_q.

In the first example, sum over p < q of x_p * x_q = 1*2 = 2, which matches.

In the second example, sum over p < q of x_p * x_q = C(2,2)*4 + C(2,2)*4 + C(2,2)*4 + C(2,2)*4 + C(2,2)*4 + C(2,2)*4 = 6*1 = 6, which is not matching.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

I must be missing something here.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that the total cost is equal to sum over all tickets of the price on the day they are bought, plus the sum over all pairs of tickets where one is bought before the other, of 1.

So, total cost = sum over p=1 to k of a_{d_p} + number of pairs (p,q) where p < q

But number of pairs (p,q) with p < q is C(k,2) = k*(k-1)/2

In the first example, sum a_{d_p} = 4 + 2*2 = 8, and C(3,2)=3, total cost 11, but example says 10, so that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's sum over p=1 to k of a_{d_p} plus sum over p=1 to k-1 of p (since each ticket p affects p tickets after it)

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think about the additional cost caused by each ticket.

Each ticket bought on day i increases the price of all future tickets by 1.

So, the additional cost caused by a ticket bought on day i is equal to the number of tickets bought on days j > i.

So, for each pair (i,j) with i < j, the ticket bought on day i increases the price of the ticket bought on day j by 1, so the additional cost is 1 for each such pair.

Therefore, total additional cost is sum over all pairs (i,j) with i < j of 1, which is C(k,2) = k*(k-1)/2

But in the first example, sum a_{d_p} = 8, additional cost = 3, total cost = 11, but example says 10.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the additional cost is not per pair, but per pair where both tickets are actually bought.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the actual number of tickets bought on each day.

Let me consider that the total additional cost is sum over all pairs (p,q) with p < q of x_p * x_q

In the first example, x_3=1,
