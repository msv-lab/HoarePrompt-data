Alright, I have this problem to solve. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1) and needs to reach cell (2,n). Every second, two things happen: the robot moves in one direction (left, right, down, or up), and then it moves according to the arrow in its current cell.

First, I need to understand the movement rules clearly. The robot can move left, right, down, or up, but it can't move outside the grid. After that, it moves according to the arrow in its current cell. So, effectively, it's making two moves each second: one based on its choice and one based on the arrow.

I need to figure out if there's a sequence of choices that can lead the robot from (1,1) to (2,n).

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting to solve this problem for multiple test cases. The main function reads the input, parses the test cases, and then calls func_1 to process each test case, collecting the results and printing them.

Now, let's dive into func_1 to see what it's doing.

func_1 takes the number of test cases t and a list of test cases. For each test case, it has n (the number of columns) and two strings representing the arrows in row 1 and row 2.

The function initializes two boolean variables: reachable_first_row to True and reachable_second_row to False. These seem to represent whether the robot can reach any cell in the first or second row at some point.

Then, it iterates through each column from 0 to n-1.

In each iteration, it first checks if reachable_first_row is True. If so, it looks at the arrow in row1 at position j.

- If the arrow is '>', it checks if j is the last column (j == n-1). If so, it sets reachable_second_row to True. This makes sense because if the robot is in the last column of row1 and the arrow points right, moving right would try to go out of the grid, but since no arrow points outside, maybe it stays in place or something. However, the problem says no arrow points outside, so perhaps '>' in the last column means it stays in place or loops back. But in this context, setting reachable_second_row to True might be because from the last column of row1, it can move down to row2, n.

- If the arrow is '<', it sets reachable_first_row to False, meaning it can't reach further in row1 from this point. Additionally, if j < n-1 and row2[j] == '>', it sets reachable_second_row to True. This seems like if the robot can't continue in row1, but if the arrow in row2 at this column points right, it might be possible to reach further in row2.

Then, it checks if reachable_second_row is True. If so, and the arrow in row2 at position j is '>', and j == n-1, it keeps reachable_second_row as True.

Wait, this seems a bit simplistic. It's trying to track if it's possible to reach the second row and the last column, but it might not be accounting for all possible movements and interactions between the rows.

Let me think about the movement more carefully.

The robot can choose to move left, right, up, or down, and then follows the arrow in its current cell.

Given that there are only two rows, moving up from row1 goes out of the grid, and moving down from row1 goes to row2, same for row2: up goes to row1, down goes out of the grid.

But the problem says no moves try to go outside the grid, so perhaps moving up from row1 is invalid, and moving down from row2 is invalid.

Wait, the problem says "the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move)". So, it can't move up from row1 or down from row2.

But in the code, it seems to be only considering movements within the grid, but perhaps not handling the movement choices properly.

Let me consider a simple example.

Take the second test case from the example:

n = 2

row1: ><

row2: ><

According to the output, it's YES.

So, possible path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)

Let's see how this would work.

Starting at (1,1), arrow is '>', so if the robot chooses to move right, it moves right to (1,2), then follows the arrow in (1,2), which is '<', so it moves left to (1,1). That's a loop.

Alternatively, if it chooses to move down, it moves to (2,1), then follows the arrow in (2,1), which is '>', so it moves right to (2,2). That's a valid path.

So, in this case, choosing to move down first leads to the target.

But in the code, it seems to be iterating through the columns and keeping track of reachability in each row.

But I'm not sure if this approach captures all possible movement choices.

Let me look at the first test case:

n = 4

row1: >><<

row2: >>><

According to the output, it's YES.

One possible path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Let's see:

- Start at (1,1), choose right, move to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Start at (1,1), choose down, move to (2,1), follow arrow '>' to (2,2)

- From (2,2), choose up, move to (1,2), follow arrow '<' to (1,1)

- Start at (1,1), choose right, move to (1,2), choose right, move to (1,3), follow arrow '<' to (1,2)

- Start at (1,1), choose down, move to (2,1), choose right, move to (2,2), choose up, move to (1,2), choose right, move to (1,3), choose down, move to (2,3), choose right, move to (2,4)

So, it's possible, but the code seems to be tracking reachability in a simplified way.

I'm starting to suspect that the code might not be correctly modeling the movement rules.

Let me consider the third test case:

n = 4

row1: >>><

row2: >><<

Output: NO

So, even though n is even, and arrows are set, there's no way to reach (2,4).

Looking at the code, it seems to be tracking if it's possible to reach the second row and then reach the last column in the second row.

But I'm not sure if this logic covers all possible scenarios, especially with the choice of movement directions.

Perhaps a better approach is to model the grid as a graph, where each cell is a node, and edges represent possible moves considering both the robot's choice and the arrow's direction.

Given the constraints (t up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5 with sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5), an efficient solution is needed, probably O(n) per test case.

The provided code seems to be O(n) per test case, but I need to verify if it's correct.

Let me think about the reachability in more detail.

The robot can choose to move in four directions, but with constraints:

- From row1:

- Left: to the previous column in row1, if exists

- Right: to the next column in row1, if exists

- Down: to row2, same column

- Up: invalid, as there's no row above

- From row2:

- Left: to the previous column in row2, if exists

- Right: to the next column in row2, if exists

- Down: invalid, as there's no row below

- Up: to row1, same column

After choosing a move, the robot moves according to the arrow in its current cell.

So, effectively, each move consists of:

1. Choosing a direction (left, right, down, up), with the constraints mentioned above.

2. Then moving according to the arrow in the current cell.

Given that, perhaps we can model the possible moves from each cell.

Let me try to model this.

Define states as (row, column).

From (1, j):

- Choose left: move to (1, j-1), then follow arrow in (1, j-1)

- Choose right: move to (1, j+1), then follow arrow in (1, j+1)

- Choose down: move to (2, j), then follow arrow in (2, j)

Similarly, from (2, j):

- Choose left: move to (2, j-1), then follow arrow in (2, j-1)

- Choose right: move to (2, j+1), then follow arrow in (2, j+1)

- Choose up: move to (1, j), then follow arrow in (1, j)

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of possible transitions between cells.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of possible positions after each second.

But given the constraints on n and t, I need an efficient solution.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be trying to track whether it's possible to reach the second row and then reach the last column in the second row.

But I'm still unsure if this captures all possible movement strategies.

Let me consider another approach.

Since the grid has only two rows, perhaps I can model the movement between rows and within rows separately.

I need to find if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

Given that, maybe I can model it as a graph and check for connectivity.

But with n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, I need something more efficient.

Perhaps dynamic programming can be used, where I track the reachable columns in each row.

Let me try to think in terms of DP.

Define dp[r][c] as whether cell (r,c) is reachable.

Initialize dp[1][1] = True

Then, for each cell, based on possible moves, update the reachability of other cells.

But with n up to 2*10^5, a standard DP approach might be too slow.

I need a smarter way to propagate reachability.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be iterating through the columns and keeping track of reachability in each row.

In particular, it maintains two flags: reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row.

It starts with reachable_first_row = True and reachable_second_row = False.

Then, for each column j from 0 to n-1:

- If reachable_first_row is True:

- If row1[j] == '>', and j == n-1, set reachable_second_row = True

- Else if row1[j] == '<', set reachable_first_row = False

- If j < n-1 and row2[j] == '>', set reachable_second_row = True

- If reachable_second_row is True:

- If row2[j] == '>' and j == n-1, keep reachable_second_row = True

This seems overly simplistic and might miss some cases.

Let me consider a counterexample.

Suppose n=2

row1: '><'

row2: '><'

According to the output, it's YES.

Possible path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)

In the code:

- Start with reachable_first_row = True, reachable_second_row = False

- j=0:

- reachable_first_row = True

- row1[0] == '>', j != n-1, so no action for row1[0]

- j < n-1 and row2[0] == '>', so set reachable_second_row = True

- reachable_second_row = True

- row2[0] == '>', j != n-1, so no action

- j=1:

- reachable_first_row is ignored since it's False now

- reachable_second_row = True

- row2[1] == '>', j == n-1, so keep reachable_second_row = True

- Final result: reachable_second_row = True, so YES

This matches the expected output.

Now, another test case where it should be NO.

n=4

row1: '>>><'

row2: '>><<'

Output: NO

In this case:

- Start with reachable_first_row = True, reachable_second_row = False

- j=0:

- reachable_first_row = True

- row1[0] == '>', j != n-1, so no action

- j < n-1 and row2[0] == '>', set reachable_second_row = True

- reachable_second_row = True

- row2[0] == '>', j != n-1, so no action

- j=1:

- reachable_first_row is ignored

- reachable_second_row = True

- row2[1] == '<', j != n-1, so no action

- j=2:

- reachable_first_row is ignored

- reachable_second_row = True

- row2[2] == '<', j != n-1, so no action

- j=3:

- reachable_first_row is ignored

- reachable_second_row = True

- row2[3] == '<', j == n-1, so no action

- Final result: reachable_second_row = True, so YES

Wait, but the expected output is NO. So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the code is flawed.

It seems that the code assumes that if reachable_second_row is True at any point, and j reaches n-1 with row2[j] == '>', then it's possible to reach (2,n). But in reality, for some configurations, even if reachable_second_row is True, it might not be possible to reach (2,n) due to the arrow directions forcing the robot to move back or in a way that doesn't allow reaching the last column.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
