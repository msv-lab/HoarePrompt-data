Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Mocha has an array of positive integers, and she can perform this operation any number of times to make all elements in the array the same. The operation involves choosing two indices l and r, finding the median of the subarray from a_l to a_r, and then setting all elements in that subarray to that median.

The goal is to find out what the maximum possible value can be when all elements in the array are the same.

First, I need to understand what a median is in this context. The problem says that the median is the element at position floor((m+1)/2) after sorting the subarray in non-decreasing order. So, for a subarray of length m, sort it, and pick the element at position floor((m+1)/2). For example, in a subarray of length 3, the median would be the second smallest element.

Okay, so the operation allows Mocha to choose any subarray, compute its median, and set all elements in that subarray to that median. She can do this repeatedly until all elements in the entire array are the same. We need to find the maximum possible value that can be achieved in the end.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example in the problem:

n = 2

a = [1, 2]

If she chooses the entire array (l=1, r=2), the subarray is [1,2], which when sorted is [1,2], so the median is 1 (since floor((2+1)/2) = 1). So, she sets both elements to 1, resulting in [1,1]. That's the only operation she can perform, and the final array is [1,1], so the answer is 1.

Another example:

n = 5

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

One possible sequence of operations is:

1. Choose (l=4, r=5), subarray [4,5], sorted is [4,5], median is 4. Set both to 4, so array becomes [1,2,3,4,4].

2. Choose (l=3, r=5), subarray [3,4,4], sorted is [3,4,4], median is 4. Set all to 4, so array becomes [1,2,4,4,4].

3. Choose (l=1, r=5), subarray [1,2,4,4,4], sorted is [1,2,4,4,4], median is 4. Set all to 4, resulting in [4,4,4,4,4].

So, the final value is 4.

Now, is it possible to get a higher value than 4? Let's see.

Suppose I choose different subarrays.

Another sequence:

1. Choose (l=2, r=4), subarray [2,3,4], sorted is [2,3,4], median is 3. Set to 3, so array becomes [1,3,3,3,5].

2. Choose (l=1, r=3), subarray [1,3,3], sorted is [1,3,3], median is 3. Set to 3, so array becomes [3,3,3,3,5].

3. Choose (l=4, r=5), subarray [3,5], sorted is [3,5], median is 3. Set to 3, so array becomes [3,3,3,3,3].

In this case, the final value is 3, which is less than 4.

Another sequence:

1. Choose (l=1, r=2), subarray [1,2], sorted is [1,2], median is 1. Set to 1, so array becomes [1,1,3,4,5].

2. Choose (l=3, r=5), subarray [3,4,5], sorted is [3,4,5], median is 4. Set to 4, so array becomes [1,1,4,4,4].

3. Choose (l=1, r=3), subarray [1,1,4], sorted is [1,1,4], median is 1. Set to 1, so array becomes [1,1,1,4,4].

4. Choose (l=4, r=5), subarray [4,4], sorted is [4,4], median is 4. Set to 4, so array becomes [1,1,1,4,4].

5. Choose (l=1, r=5), subarray [1,1,1,4,4], sorted is [1,1,1,4,4], median is 1. Set to 1, so array becomes [1,1,1,1,1].

In this case, the final value is 1.

It seems that in different sequences, I can get different final values, but the maximum seems to be 4 in this example.

So, how do I generalize this to find the maximum possible final value for any array?

Let me think about the properties of this operation.

First, the operation allows me to set a subarray to its median. The median is the middle element in the sorted order of the subarray.

One important observation is that the median is at least the smallest element in the subarray and at most the largest element.

Wait, actually, for a subarray of odd length, the median is one of the elements in the subarray. For even length subarrays, depending on how you define the median, it could be one of the elements or an average, but in this problem, it's defined as the element at position floor((m+1)/2) after sorting, which for even m is the smaller of the two middle elements.

So, for any subarray, the median is always one of the elements in the subarray.

Therefore, when we set the subarray to its median, we are setting all elements in that subarray to one of their values.

This means that we are effectively replacing some elements with others that are already present in the subarray.

Our goal is to maximize the final uniform value of the array.

I need to find a way to propagate the highest possible values across the array using these operations.

Let's consider that in each operation, we can choose any subarray and set it to its median.

I need to see how I can increase the values in the array step by step.

Wait, but setting a subarray to its median might not always increase the values; it could decrease them if the median is smaller than some elements in the subarray.

But our goal is to maximize the final uniform value, so I need to find a way to propagate the highest possible values.

Let me consider the highest value in the array initially.

In the second example, the highest value is 5.

Is it possible to set the entire array to 5?

Let's see.

If I choose the entire array [1,2,3,4,5], its median is 3 (since sorted is [1,2,3,4,5], floor((5+1)/2)=3, which is the third element, which is 3). So, setting the entire array to 3.

Now, if I try to choose a subarray that includes 5 and has a median higher than 3, maybe I can get higher values.

Wait, in a subarray that includes 5, the median could be 5 if the subarray is chosen appropriately.

For example, choose subarray [3,4,5], sorted is [3,4,5], median is 4.

Set all to 4, so now the array is [1,2,4,4,5].

Now, choose subarray [1,2,4], sorted is [1,2,4], median is 2.

Set to 2, so array becomes [2,2,4,4,5].

Now, choose subarray [4,4,5], sorted is [4,4,5], median is 4.

Set to 4, so array becomes [2,2,4,4,4].

Now, choose the entire array [2,2,4,4,4], sorted is [2,2,4,4,4], median is 4.

Set to 4, so array becomes [4,4,4,4,4].

So, again, I get 4.

Is it possible to get 5?

Let's try another sequence.

Choose subarray [4,5], sorted is [4,5], median is 4.

Set to 4, so array becomes [1,2,3,4,4].

Now, choose subarray [3,4,4], sorted is [3,4,4], median is 4.

Set to 4, so array becomes [1,2,4,4,4].

Now, choose subarray [1,2,4], sorted is [1,2,4], median is 2.

Set to 2, so array becomes [2,2,4,4,4].

Now, choose the entire array [2,2,4,4,4], sorted is [2,2,4,4,4], median is 4.

Set to 4, so array becomes [4,4,4,4,4].

Again, 4.

Is there a way to get 5?

Let's see.

If I choose subarray [5], but l and r must satisfy l < r, so subarrays of length 1 are not allowed.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, so subarrays must have at least two elements.

So, I cannot choose a subarray of a single element.

So, I cannot directly set any element to 5 unless there is a subarray containing 5 and its median is 5.

For example, choose subarray [5, something], if that something is less than 5, the median could be 5 if the subarray is of even length and the higher middle element is 5.

Wait, but in the second example, the array is [1,2,3,4,5], and any subarray containing 5 will have a median that is at most 4, because there are elements smaller than 5.

Wait, for example, choose subarray [4,5], sorted is [4,5], median is 4.

Set to 4, so [4,4].

Choose subarray [3,4,4], sorted is [3,4,4], median is 4.

Set to 4, so [4,4,4].

Now, choose subarray [1,2,4], sorted is [1,2,4], median is 2.

Set to 2, so [2,2,4,4,4].

Choose the entire array [2,2,4,4,4], sorted is [2,2,4,4,4], median is 4.

Set to 4, so [4,4,4,4,4].

Again, 4.

Is there a way to get 5?

Suppose I choose subarray [3,4,5], sorted is [3,4,5], median is 4.

Set to 4, so [1,2,4,4,5].

Now, choose subarray [2,4,4], sorted is [2,4,4], median is 4.

Set to 4, so [1,4,4,4,5].

Now, choose subarray [1,4,4], sorted is [1,4,4], median is 4.

Set to 4, so [4,4,4,4,5].

Now, choose the entire array [4,4,4,4,5], sorted is [4,4,4,4,5], median is 4.

Set to 4, so [4,4,4,4,4].

Still 4.

It seems impossible to get 5 in this example.

Is there a way?

Let's think differently.

Suppose I choose subarrays that include 5 and have other high values.

For example, choose subarray [3,4,5], set to median 4, so [1,2,4,4,5].

Then choose subarray [4,5], set to median 4, so [1,2,4,4,4].

Then choose subarray [1,2,4], set to median 2, so [2,2,4,4,4].

Then choose the entire array, set to median 4, so [4,4,4,4,4].

Again, 4.

Alternatively, choose subarray [2,3,4], set to median 3, so [1,3,3,4,5].

Then choose subarray [3,4,5], set to median 4, so [1,3,4,4,4].

Then choose subarray [1,3,4], set to median 3, so [3,3,4,4,4].

Then choose the entire array, set to median 4, so [4,4,4,4,4].

Still 4.

It seems that 4 is the highest achievable in this example.

So, how do I generalize this to find the maximum possible final value?

Let me think about the properties of these operations.

Each operation sets a subarray to its median.

The median is the floor((m+1)/2)th element in the sorted subarray.

For a subarray of length m, the median is the element at position floor((m+1)/2).

Wait, in the problem statement, it's clearly defined as the floor((m+1)/2)th element after sorting.

So, for m=3, it's the second smallest element.

For m=4, it's the third smallest element, and so on.

Wait, no, floor((m+1)/2):

For m=3, floor((3+1)/2)=floor(2)=2nd element.

For m=4, floor((4+1)/2)=floor(2.25)=2nd element.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, floor((4+1)/2)=floor(2.5)=2, so it's the 2nd element.

Wait, but in the example, for m=4, subarray [1,2,3,4], sorted is [1,2,3,4], median is 2nd element, which is 2.

But in the operation, they set all to x=2.

Wait, but in the second example, when they chose (l,r)=(4,5), subarray [4,5], sorted is [4,5], median is 4, set all to 4.

Wait, for m=2, floor((2+1)/2)=floor(1.5)=1, so the first element.

Wait, but in the operation, for subarray [4,5], sorted is [4,5], median is 4, which is the first element.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the median is the floor((m+1)/2)th element after sorting.

So, for m=2, floor((2+1)/2)=floor(1.5)=1, so the first element.

Hence, in subarray [4,5], median is 4.

Similarly, for m=3, floor((3+1)/2)=floor(2)=1, so the first element.

Wait, no, floor(3+1)/2 = floor(2)=2.

Wait, floor((3+1)/2)=floor(2)=2.

Wait, hold on, (3+1)/2=2, floor of 2 is 2.

So, for m=3, it's the second element.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

For m=3, floor((3+1)/2)=floor(2)=2nd element.

For m=4, floor((4+1)/2)=floor(2.5)=2nd element.

So, in m=3, it's the second smallest element.

Wait, but in the example, for subarray [3,4,5], sorted [3,4,5], median is 4, which is the second element.

Wait, but in another operation, for subarray [4,5], sorted [4,5], median is 4, which is the first element.

Wait, but according to the definition, for m=2, floor((2+1)/2)=floor(1.5)=1, so the first element.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in general, for any subarray, the median is floor((m+1)/2)th element after sorting.

Now, to maximize the final uniform value, I need to find a way to propagate the highest possible values across the array using these operations.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can choose a subarray and set it to its median, which is one of the elements in the subarray.

I need to see how I can use this to increase the values in the array.

Wait, but setting a subarray to its median might not always increase the values; it could decrease them if the median is smaller than some elements in the subarray.

So, I need a strategy to maximize the final value.

Let me consider that the final uniform value cannot be higher than the initial maximum value in the array.

Because the median of any subarray cannot be higher than the maximum element in that subarray.

Hence, the final value cannot be higher than the initial maximum.

So, the answer is always less than or equal to the initial maximum.

In the second example, the initial maximum is 5, but the achievable final uniform value is 4.

So, it's not always the initial maximum.

So, what determines the maximum achievable final uniform value?

Let me consider that in order to achieve a certain value, say x, I need to be able to set the entire array to x using these operations.

To set the entire array to x, I need to ensure that x can be propagated to all positions in the array through a series of operations.

One way to think about this is to consider the connected components where x is present.

If x is present in some part of the array, I can try to expand this part to cover the entire array by choosing subarrays that include both parts with x and parts without x, and setting the subarrays to x if possible.

But this seems a bit vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to achieve a final uniform value of x.

This means that at some point, the entire array must be set to x.

To set the entire array to x, I need to have a subarray that includes the entire array, and its median is x.

But the median of the entire array is floor((n+1)/2)th smallest element.

In the second example, for n=5, the median is the 3rd smallest element, which is 3 in the initial array.

So, to set the entire array to 4, I need to have 4 as the median at some point.

How can I achieve that?

I need to manipulate the array such that in the entire array, the 3rd smallest element is 4.

Initially, the 3rd smallest element is 3.

By performing operations, I can change the array to have at least 3 elements that are 4 or higher.

Wait, but in the operations, I can only set subarrays to their median.

It's getting a bit complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in order to maximize the final uniform value, I need to find the smallest value that appears in every subarray of a certain type.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Another idea: since I can set any subarray to its median, perhaps I can model this as finding the maximum value that appears in some subarray and is also less than or equal to the median of that subarray.

Wait, that seems unclear.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can choose any subarray and set it to its median.

This is similar to replacing the subarray with its median value.

I can perform this operation multiple times until all elements are the same.

I need to find the maximum possible value that can be achieved in the end.

Let me consider that in order to maximize the final value, I should try to propagate the highest possible values across the array.

One way to think about this is to consider the highest value in the array and see if it's possible to set the entire array to that value.

If it's possible, great; if not, find the next highest value that can be propagated to the entire array.

This sounds similar to finding the largest value that appears in every possible subarray that can be chosen in some sequence leading to a uniform array.

But that's still too vague.

Let me consider that in order for the final uniform value to be x, x must be present in every subarray that is chosen in the final steps leading to the uniform array.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the array sorted.

If I sort the array, the median of the entire array is the floor((n+1)/2)th element.

In the second example, sorted array is [1,2,3,4,5], median is 3.

But in the operations, I can choose any subarrays and set them to their medians.

It's not immediately clear how to relate this to the sorted array.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the array in terms of its order statistics.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal value that can be propagated to the entire array.

Wait, but I need the maximum possible final uniform value.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can choose a subarray and set it to its median, which is one of the existing values in the subarray.

This is similar to replacing the subarray with one of its values, specifically the median as defined.

Given that, I can think of this as a process of propagating certain values across the array.

I need to find a way to maximize the final uniform value.

Let me consider that in order to set the entire array to x, x must be present in some subarray that covers the entire array after some operations.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can choose any two indices l and r, compute the median of the subarray from l to r, and set the subarray to that median.

I can perform this operation multiple times.

I need to find the maximum x such that I can set the entire array to x.

I need to find the minimal value that is present in every subarray that is chosen in some sequence leading to a uniform array.

Wait, that still doesn't help.

Let me consider that in order to set the entire array to x, x must be present in some subarray that covers the entire array.

But in reality, I can choose any subarrays I want, and set them to their medians, which are one of the existing values in the subarray.

This seems quite flexible.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal value in the array.

In the first example, with n=2 and a=[1,2], the minimal value is 1, and that's the only possible final uniform value.

In the second example, with n=5 and a=[1,2,3,4,5], the final uniform value is 4.

So, it's not simply the minimal value.

Wait, in the first example, it was the minimal value, but in the second example, it's not.

Wait, perhaps it's the second smallest value in the array.

In the first example, with n=2, the second smallest is 2, but the answer is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the floor((n+1)/2)th smallest element in the array.

In the first example, n=2, floor((2+1)/2)=1, so the first smallest element, which is 1.

In the second example, n=5, floor((5+1)/2)=3, so the third smallest element, which is 3.

But in the example, they achieved 4, which is higher than 3.

So, that can't be it.

Wait, maybe it's more complicated.

Let me consider that in each operation, I can choose any subarray and set it to its median.

I can perform this operation multiple times.

I need to find a sequence of operations that leads to all elements being equal to the highest possible value.

Let me consider that in order
