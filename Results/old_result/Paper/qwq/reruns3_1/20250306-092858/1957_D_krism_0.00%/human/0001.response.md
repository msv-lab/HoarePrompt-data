Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I need to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n, and f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) is greater than f(x, z). Here, f(l, r) is the XOR of all elements from a_l to a_r.

First, I need to understand what f(x, y) represents. It's the XOR of elements from index x to y. XOR is a bitwise operation that returns 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they're the same. It's also associative, which means that the order in which I perform the operations doesn't matter.

So, f(x, y) is a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_y XOR (a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_{x-1}). Wait, no. Actually, f(x, y) is a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y. To compute this efficiently, I can use a prefix XOR array. Let's define prefix[i] as a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_i. Then, f(x, y) = prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1].

Similarly, f(y, z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1], and f(x, z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1].

So, the condition is: f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) > f(x, z).

Let's compute f(x, y) XOR f(y, z):

f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = (prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1]) XOR (prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1]).

Using the properties of XOR, this simplifies to:

prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1].

I can rearrange the terms:

(prefix[y] XOR prefix[y-1]) XOR (prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z]).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and how it affects the comparison.

I know that XOR compares each bit independently, and the result is 1 only if the bits differ. So, when I have f(x, y) XOR f(y, z), I'm essentially looking at the bits where these two XORs differ.

Now, the condition is that this result is greater than f(x, z). Since all values are non-negative integers, "greater than" means that somewhere in the binary representation, there's a bit where f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) has a 1 and f(x, z) has a 0.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can look at the expression f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) > f(x, z) in terms of the binary representations.

Let me try to expand f(x, y), f(y, z), and f(x, z) in terms of the prefix XORs:

f(x, y) = prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1]

f(y, z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1]

f(x, z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = (prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1]) XOR (prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1])

Simplifying that:

prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1]

And we need this to be greater than f(x, z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, the condition is:

(prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1]) > (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1])

Let me see if I can simplify this expression.

Let me denote A = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

Then the condition becomes:

(prefix[y] XOR A XOR prefix[y-1]) > A

So, (prefix[y] XOR prefix[y-1] XOR A) > A

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Maybe I need to consider the properties of XOR and how it affects the comparison.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over y and consider x and z separately.

Given that x ≤ y ≤ z, maybe I can fix y and then find the number of pairs (x, z) that satisfy the condition.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look back at the sample input and output to see if I can find a pattern.

Sample Input 1:

3

6 2 4

Possible tuples:

(1,1,1): f(1,1)=6, f(1,1)=6, f(1,1)=6 → 6 XOR 6 = 0 > 6? No

(1,1,2): f(1,1)=6, f(1,2)=6 XOR 2=4, f(1,2)=4 → 6 XOR 4 = 2 > 4? 2 > 4? No

(1,1,3): f(1,1)=6, f(1,3)=6 XOR 2 XOR 4=0, f(1,3)=0 → 6 XOR 0 = 6 > 0? Yes

(1,2,2): f(1,2)=4, f(2,2)=2, f(1,2)=4 → 4 XOR 2 = 6 > 4? Yes

(1,2,3): f(1,2)=4, f(2,3)=2 XOR 4=6, f(1,3)=0 → 4 XOR 6 = 2 > 0? Yes

(1,3,3): f(1,3)=0, f(3,3)=4, f(1,3)=0 → 0 XOR 4 = 4 > 0? Yes

(2,2,2): f(2,2)=2, f(2,2)=2, f(2,2)=2 → 2 XOR 2 = 0 > 2? No

(2,2,3): f(2,2)=2, f(2,3)=6, f(2,3)=6 → 2 XOR 6 = 4 > 6? 4 > 6? No

(2,3,3): f(2,3)=6, f(3,3)=4, f(2,3)=6 → 6 XOR 4 = 2 > 6? No

(3,3,3): f(3,3)=4, f(3,3)=4, f(3,3)=4 → 4 XOR 4 = 0 > 4? No

So, only the tuples (1,1,3), (1,2,2), (1,2,3), (1,3,3) satisfy the condition, totaling 4, which matches the sample output.

Looking at these tuples, is there a pattern or a way to group them for efficient counting?

Let me see if I can find a mathematical or bitwise property that can help me count these tuples efficiently, especially since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the total n across all test cases up to 10^5.

I need an efficient way to compute this without iterating through all possible tuples, which would be O(n^3) and too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the properties of XOR and how it affects the comparison.

Given that XOR is involved, perhaps I can look at the bits independently and use some bitwise properties to count the tuples.

I recall that in XOR operations, each bit is independent, so maybe I can consider each bit position separately and see how it contributes to the overall condition.

Let me think about the condition again: f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) > f(x, z)

Let me denote:

A = f(x, y)

B = f(y, z)

C = f(x, z)

So, A XOR B > C

I need to find the number of tuples where this inequality holds.

Let me consider the binary representations of A, B, and C.

The XOR of A and B will flip the bits where A and B differ.

I need this result to be greater than C.

This seems tricky because comparison involves the overall value, considering all bits.

Maybe I can look for the highest bit where A XOR B and C differ.

If the highest bit where A XOR B and C differ is set in A XOR B and not in C, then A XOR B > C.

Wait, that might be a way to think about it.

But I'm not sure how to apply this directly.

Let me consider that A = prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1]

B = prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1]

C = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, A XOR B = (prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1]) XOR (prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1]) = prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1]

And C = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, A XOR B = prefix[y] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1]

Which can be rearranged as (prefix[y] XOR prefix[y-1]) XOR (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]) = f(y, y) XOR C, but f(y, y) is just a_y.

Wait, f(y, y) = a_y.

So, A XOR B = a_y XOR C

Therefore, the condition simplifies to a_y XOR C > C, which is a_y XOR C > f(x, z)

But f(x, z) is C.

So, the condition is a_y XOR C > C

Let me denote C = f(x, z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, a_y XOR C > C

This seems simpler.

Now, I need to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) where x ≤ y ≤ z, and a_y XOR C > C, where C = f(x, z).

This seems more manageable.

Let me see.

Given that x ≤ y ≤ z, and y is in between x and z, perhaps I can iterate over y and then find suitable x and z for each y.

Let's fix y, and then consider the possible x and z such that x ≤ y ≤ z, and a_y XOR C > C, where C = f(x, z).

But f(x, z) is prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1].

This still seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for a fixed y, a_y is fixed, and C = f(x, z) varies depending on x and z.

I need to count the number of (x, z) pairs where x ≤ y ≤ z, and a_y XOR C > C.

This seems tricky because C depends on x and z.

Maybe I can look at the inequality a_y XOR C > C and see under what conditions this holds.

Let me consider the binary representations of a_y and C.

I know that a_y XOR C will flip the bits of C where a_y has a 1.

So, if a_y has a 1 in a higher bit position than C, then a_y XOR C will be larger than C.

Wait, but XOR doesn't just flip higher bits; it flips bits where a_y has a 1.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I can look at the most significant bit (MSB) where a_y and C differ.

If the MSB where a_y XOR C has a 1 and C has a 0, then a_y XOR C > C.

Wait, that seems promising.

So, if the highest bit where a_y and C differ is set in a_y XOR C and not set in C, then a_y XOR C > C.

In other words, if a_y has a higher MSB than C, or if the first bit from the MSB where a_y and C differ has a 1 in a_y and a 0 in C, then a_y XOR C > C.

This sounds correct.

So, to have a_y XOR C > C, the binary representation of a_y XOR C should be greater than C.

Given that XOR flips bits where a_y has a 1, this can make C larger or smaller depending on the bit positions.

This seems too vague for an efficient computation.

Let me consider another approach.

Perhaps I can precompute the prefix XOR array, and then for each y, find the number of pairs (x, z) where x ≤ y ≤ z, and a_y XOR (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]) > (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]).

This is similar to what I had before.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the properties of XOR and how it affects the inequality.

Let me consider that a_y XOR C > C is equivalent to a_y XOR C - C > 0.

But XOR is not directly compatible with subtraction in a simple way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the binary representations bit by bit, starting from the most significant bit, and decide based on whether a_y has a 1 or 0 at each bit position.

This seems too involved for a direct implementation, especially considering the time constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me look at the sample input again.

Sample Input 1:

3

6 2 4

From earlier, we have:

(1,1,3): a_y = 6, C = 0 → 6 XOR 0 = 6 > 0? Yes

(1,2,2): a_y = 2, C = 2 → 2 XOR 2 = 0 > 2? No, but in the earlier analysis, it was considered yes. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, in the initial analysis, for (1,2,2):

a_y = a_2 = 2, C = f(1,2) = 6 XOR 2 = 4

So, a_y XOR C = 2 XOR 4 = 6 > 4? 6 > 4? Yes

Ah, I see. So, in this case, a_y XOR C = 6 > 4, which is true.

Similarly, for (1,2,3):

a_y = 2, C = f(1,3) = 6 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 0

2 XOR 0 = 2 > 0? Yes

And for (1,3,3):

a_y = a_3 = 4, C = f(1,3) = 0

4 XOR 0 = 4 > 0? Yes

So, in all these cases, a_y XOR C > C holds.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I thought a_y XOR C > C is equivalent to a_y XOR C - C > 0, but that doesn't seem directly helpful.

Let me think differently.

I recall that for two non-negative integers, A > B is equivalent to there exists a bit position where A has a 1 and B has a 0, and for all higher positions, A and B have the same bit.

But in XOR, it's flipping bits where a_y has a 1.

This seems too convoluted.

Perhaps I need to consider that a_y XOR C > C if and only if a_y > C.

Wait, is that true?

No, consider a_y = 1, C = 0: 1 XOR 0 = 1 > 0? Yes, and 1 > 0 is also true.

Another example: a_y = 1, C = 1: 1 XOR 1 = 0 > 1? No, and 1 > 1 is false.

Another example: a_y = 2, C = 1: 2 XOR 1 = 3 > 1? Yes, and 2 > 1 is true.

Wait, but 2 > 1 is true, and a_y XOR C > C is also true.

Another example: a_y = 1, C = 2: 1 XOR 2 = 3 > 2? Yes, but 1 > 2 is false.

So, in this case, a_y XOR C > C does not imply a_y > C.

Wait, in this case, a_y XOR C > C is true, but a_y > C is false.

So, they are not equivalent.

Hence, a_y XOR C > C is not simply equivalent to a_y > C.

So, that approach doesn't work.

I need another way.

Let me consider the expression a_y XOR C > C.

Let me denote C = f(x, z).

I need a_y XOR C > C.

Let me consider that a_y XOR C is equal to C XOR a_y, since XOR is commutative.

So, C XOR a_y > C.

Now, I need to find when C XOR a_y > C.

This seems similar to the earlier analysis.

I need a way to count the number of C where C XOR a_y > C.

This still seems tricky.

Let me think about the binary representation again.

Let me consider the binary representations of C and a_y.

Let me find the highest bit where C and a_y differ.

If a_y has a 1 and C has a 0 at that bit, then C XOR a_y will have a 1 there, making it larger than C.

Otherwise, if a_y has a 0 and C has a 1, then C XOR a_y will have a 0 there, which could make it smaller.

Wait, but since XOR flips the bits where a_y has a 1, it's not straightforward.

Let me formalize this.

Let k be the highest bit where a_y and C differ.

If such a bit exists, then:

- If a_y has a 1 and C has a 0 at bit k, then C XOR a_y will have a 1 at bit k, and for all higher bits, C and C XOR a_y are equal.

Hence, C XOR a_y > C.

- If a_y has a 0 and C has a 1 at bit k, then C XOR a_y will have a 0 at bit k, and for all higher bits, they are equal.

Hence, C XOR a_y < C.

Therefore, C XOR a_y > C if and only if the highest bit where a_y and C differ has a 1 in a_y and a 0 in C.

This makes sense.

So, for a_y and C, if the highest bit where they differ has a 1 in a_y and a 0 in C, then C XOR a_y > C.

Otherwise, C XOR a_y ≤ C.

Therefore, for each y, I need to count the number of C = f(x, z) where x ≤ y ≤ z, and the highest bit where a_y and C differ has a 1 in a_y and a 0 in C.

This seems complex, but perhaps I can find a way to count these C values efficiently.

Let me consider that for a fixed y, a_y is fixed.

I can iterate over y from 1 to n, and for each y, I need to consider all x ≤ y and z ≥ y.

Given that x ≤ y and z ≥ y, I can think of x ranging from 1 to y and z ranging from y to n.

But directly iterating over x and z would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider precomputing the prefix XOR array.

Let prefix[0] = 0

prefix[i] = a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_i for i from 1 to n.

Then, f(x, z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, C = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

For a fixed y, I need to count the number of pairs (x, z) where x ≤ y and z ≥ y, such that a_y XOR (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]) > (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1])

Which is a_y XOR C > C

As per the earlier analysis, this holds if the highest bit where a_y and C differ has a 1 in a_y and a 0 in C.

Let me consider each bit position independently.

Let me iterate over bit positions from the highest to the lowest.

For each bit position k, I can check if a_y has a 1 and C has a 0 at that position, and for all higher positions, a_y and C are equal.

But this seems too slow if done naively.

I need a better way to count the number of C that satisfy this condition.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each bit position how many C have that bit set or unset, given the constraints on x and y.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for a fixed y, and for each bit position k, I can count the number of C where a_y and C differ at bit k, and a_y has a 1 and C has a 0 at that bit, and for all higher bits, a_y and C are equal.

This seems like a way to count the number of C where a_y XOR C > C.

But implementing this directly would be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for a fixed y, and for a fixed bit position k, I can count the number of C where:

- a_y has a 1 at bit k

- C has a 0 at bit k

- and for all j > k, the bits of a_y and C are equal.

This would contribute to the count only if a_y has a 1 at bit k and C has a 0 at bit k, and they are equal in all higher bits.

This seems like I can process the bits from high to low and keep track of the prefixes where the higher bits match.

This sounds similar to bitwise trie or prefix counting.

Maybe I can use a frequency table for the prefix XOR values up to a certain point.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain two arrays: one for the frequency of C with certain properties before y and another after y.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a fixed y, x ranges from 1 to y, and z ranges from y to n.

So, for a fixed y, C = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1], where x-1 ranges from 0 to y-1, and z ranges from y to n.

So, C is the XOR of prefix[z] and prefix[x-1], with x-1 ≤ y-1 and z ≥ y.

I can think of prefix[x-1] as ranging over prefix[0] to prefix[y-1], and prefix[z] ranging over prefix[y] to prefix[n].

So, C is the XOR of one value from prefix[0..y-1] and one value from prefix[y..n].

Therefore, for a fixed y, the possible C values are all possible XORs of prefix[i] for i < y and prefix[j] for j ≥ y.

So, C = prefix[j] XOR prefix[i], where i < y ≤ j.

Now, I need to count the number of such C where a_y XOR C > C.

From earlier, a_y XOR C > C if the highest bit where a_y and C differ has a 1 in a_y and a 0 in C.

Let me denote that condition as bit k, where k is the highest bit where a_y and C differ, and a_y has a 1 at bit k and C has a 0.

Given that, I can iterate over bit positions from the highest to the lowest, and for each bit, check if a_y has a 1 and C has a 0, and for all higher bits, a_y and C are equal.

This seems like I can compute the number of C that satisfy this for each y.

But I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider precomputing for each bit position, the number of C that have a 0 or 1 at that bit, given the constraints on x and z.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the frequency of each bit in C for all possible C.

But with n up to 1e5, and t up to 1e4, I need something faster.

Wait, the total n across all test cases is up to 1e5, so per test case, n can be up to 1e5, and t up to 1e4, but total n is 1e5.

So, overall time complexity should be O(n), or at least O(n log n), but not higher.

I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and how it affects the bit patterns.

I recall that XOR is its own inverse, meaning that XOR-ing twice cancels out.

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Let me consider that for a fixed y, and for each bit position k, I can determine how many C satisfy the condition based on the bit values of a_y and C at position k.

Specifically, for each y, and for each bit position k, if a_y has a 1 at k, and C has a 0 at k, and for all higher bits, a_y and C are equal, then C XOR a_y > C.

I need to count such C for each y.

This seems like I can process the bits from high to low and keep track of the prefix matching up to that bit.

This sounds similar to trie data structure, where I can store the prefix XOR values and query for the number of C with certain bit patterns.

But implementing a trie for each y would be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for each y, and for each bit position k, I can compute the number of C where:

- a_y has a 1 at k

- C has a 0 at k

- and for all j > k, a_y and C have the same value at bit j.

Given that, I can iterate over k from high to low, and for each k, compute the number of C that satisfy the condition.

This seems feasible.

Let me try to formalize this.

For a fixed y, and a fixed bit position k:

- Let mask be the bits of a_y higher than k (including k).

- I need C to have the same higher bits as a_y up to k.

- At bit k, a_y has a 1 and C has a 0.

- Below bit k, C can be anything.

Wait, but I need C to have the same higher bits as a_y up to k.

So, for bits j > k, C should have the same value as a_y.

At bit k, a_y has a 1 and C has a 0.

Then, for bits j < k, C can be anything.

Given that, I can compute the number of C that satisfy this condition.

To do this, I need to compute how many C have the higher bits matching a_y up to k, and bit k set to 0.

Given that C = prefix[j] XOR prefix[i], where i < y and j ≥ y.

I need to count the number of such C that satisfy the bit conditions.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can precompute the frequency of prefix[j] XOR prefix[i] for all i < y and j ≥ y.

Wait, but directly computing this for each y would still be O(n^2).

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for a fixed y, C = prefix[j] XOR prefix[i], with i < y and j ≥ y.

I can precompute all prefix[i] for i < y and all prefix[j] for j ≥ y.

Then, C is the XOR of one prefix[i] from i < y and one prefix[j] from j ≥ y.

So, for a fixed y, the number of possible C is the number of pairs (i, j) where i < y and j ≥ y.

This is y * (n - y + 1), which is up to n^2, which is too big.

I need a way to count the number of C that satisfy a_y XOR C > C without enumerating all possible C.

Let me consider that a_y XOR C > C is equivalent to C XOR a_y > C.

As XOR is commutative, this holds.

I need C XOR a_y > C.

From earlier analysis, this holds when the highest bit where C and a_y differ has a 1 in a_y and a 0 in C.

Let me consider that for each bit position k from high to low:

- If a_y and C have different bits at k:

- If a_y has a 1 and C has a 0, then C XOR a_y > C.

- Else, C XOR a_y < C.

- If a_y and C have the same bit at k, proceed to the next lower bit.

So, for each y, and for each bit position k, I need to count the number of C where:

- For all j > k, C and a_y have the same bit.

- At k, a_y has a 1 and C has a 0.

- Bits below k can be anything.

Given that, for each y and for each k, I can compute the number of C that satisfy this.

To do this efficiently, I can precompute for each k, the number of C that have the higher bits matching a_y up to k, and bit k set to 0.

This seems feasible if I can precompute the frequency of C's bits for each k.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain two arrays:

- pre[k][0/1]: number of C where the higher bits match a_y up to k, and bit k is 0/1.

- suf[k][0/1]: similar for suffix.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that C = prefix[j] XOR prefix[i], with i < y and j ≥ y.

I can precompute all prefix[i] for i < y and all prefix[j] for j ≥ y.

Then, C is the XOR of one prefix[i] and one prefix[j].

Given that, for a fixed y, a_y is fixed.

I need to count the number of C where a_y XOR C > C.

Let me consider that a_y XOR C > C is equivalent to C XOR a_y > C.

I can iterate over bit positions from high to low for a_y and C.

Find the highest bit k where a_y and C differ.

If a_y has a 1 and C has a 0 at that bit, then C XOR a_y > C.

Otherwise, C XOR a_y < C.

So, for each y, and for each bit position k from high to low, I need to find the number of C where:

- For all j > k, C and a_y have the same bit.

- At k, a_y has a 1 and C has a 0.

- Bits below k can be anything.

Given that, for each y and k, I can compute the number of C that satisfy this.

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can precompute for each k, the number of C that have the higher bits matching a_y up to k, and bit k set to 0.

Then, sum over all k where a_y has a 1 at k and C has a 0 at k, and they match on higher bits.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, for each y, I need to consider a_y.

Then, for each bit position k from 0 to 31 (since a_i can be up to 1e9, which is within 31 bits), I need to find the number of C where:

- For all j > k, C and a_y have the same bit.

- At k, a_y has a 1 and C has a 0.

- Bits below k can be anything.

To compute this, I can precompute for each k, the number of C where:

- For all j from k to 31, C has the same bit as a_y.

- At k, C has a 0.

Given that C = prefix[j] XOR prefix[i], with i < y and j ≥ y.

I need to find the number of such C that satisfy the above conditions.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can maintain frequency tables for the higher bits of C.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that C is the XOR of prefix[j] and prefix[i], and prefix[j] and prefix[i] are independent.

So, for a fixed y, I can have:

- prefix[i] for i from 0 to y-1.

- prefix[j] for j from y to n.

Then, C = prefix[j] XOR prefix[i].

So, C is the XOR of one prefix[j] and one prefix[i].

Given that, for a fixed y, I can consider prefix[i] as a set A, and prefix[j] as a set B.

Then, C is the XOR of one element from A and one element from B.

Now, I need to count the number of (a, b) where a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and a_y XOR (b XOR a) > (b XOR a).

Which is a_y XOR C > C, where C = b XOR a.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for a fixed y, a_y is fixed.

I need to count the number of C where a_y XOR C > C.

Let me consider that a_y XOR C > C is equivalent to C XOR a_y > C.

I can iterate over the bit positions from high to low and find the highest bit where a_y and C differ.

If at that bit, a_y has a 1 and C has a 0, then C XOR a_y > C.

Otherwise, C XOR a_y < C.

So, for each y, I can iterate over bit positions from 31 to 0 (assuming 32-bit integers), and for each k:

- If a_y has a 1 at k and C has a 0 at k, and for all j > k, a_y and C have the same bit, then C XOR a_y > C.

- Otherwise, it's not.

So, for each y, I can compute the number of C that satisfy this condition for each k.

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can precompute for each k, the number of C where:

- For all j from k to 31, C has the same bit as a_y.

- At k, C has a
