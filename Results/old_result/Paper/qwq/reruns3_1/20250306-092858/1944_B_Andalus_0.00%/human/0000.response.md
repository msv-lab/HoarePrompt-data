Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's this integer k, which is between 1 and n/2, inclusive. I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k, with specific properties.

First, l should be a subset of the first n elements of the array, and r should be a subset of the last n elements. Also, the bitwise XOR of the elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in r.

The problem says that at least one pair of l and r always exists, and if there are multiple solutions, I can output any one of them.

Alright, let's try to understand what's being asked here. I have two halves of the array, each containing n elements, and each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the whole array, once in each half.

I need to pick 2k elements from the first half and 2k elements from the second half such that the XOR of the elements in both subsets is the same.

Hmm, XOR is a bitwise operation that returns 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. It's associative and commutative, which means the order in which I perform the operations doesn't matter.

First, I need to think about how to select subsets l and r from the first and second halves respectively, ensuring that their XORs are equal.

Let me consider the properties of XOR:

1. XOR of a number with itself is zero.

2. XOR is commutative and associative.

3. XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, once in each half, I need to select subsets l and r such that the XOR of elements in l equals the XOR of elements in r.

Wait a minute, since each number appears exactly twice, once in each half, I can think in terms of pairs.

Let me try to think differently. If I select some elements from the first half and some from the second half, and I want their XORs to be equal, that means the XOR of the selected elements in l should equal the XOR of the selected elements in r.

Let me consider the total XOR of all elements in the first half and the second half.

Wait, but the entire array has each number from 1 to n appearing twice, once in each half. So, the XOR of the entire first half would be equal to the XOR of the entire second half, because they contain the same numbers.

Wait, is that true? Let's see for n=2:

Array: 1,2,2,1

XOR of first half: 1 XOR 2 = 3

XOR of second half: 2 XOR 1 = 3

Yes, they are equal.

For n=6:

Array: 6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

XOR of first half: 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 = (6 XOR 4) = 2, then 2 XOR 2 = 0, then 0 XOR 1 = 1

XOR of second half: 2 XOR 3 XOR 1 XOR 6 XOR 3 XOR 5 XOR 5 XOR 4

Wait, the second half is a[7] to a[12]: 1,6,3,5,5,4

So, 1 XOR 6 = 7, 7 XOR 3 = 4, 4 XOR 5 = 1, 1 XOR 5 = 4, 4 XOR 4 = 0

Wait, but the first half is a[1] to a[6]: 6,4,2,1,2,3

XOR: 6 XOR 4 = 2, 2 XOR 2 = 0, 0 XOR 1 = 1, 1 XOR 3 = 2

So, in this case, the XOR of the first half is 2, and the second half is 0. Wait, but according to my earlier assumption, they should be equal because each number appears twice, once in each half.

Wait, in this example, n=6, so numbers from 1 to 6 appear twice, once in each half.

Wait, but in the array provided: 6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

Let's verify:

Numbers from 1 to 6:

1: appears at positions 4 and 7

2: positions 3 and 6

3: positions 5 and 8

4: positions 2 and 12

5: positions 10 and 11

6: positions 1 and 7

Wait, 6 appears at positions 1 and 7, which are in different halves. Similarly, others are in different halves.

Wait, but in the first half: positions 1 to 6: 6,4,2,1,2,3

Second half: positions 7 to 12: 1,6,3,5,5,4

So, numbers from 1 to 6 appear once in each half.

Wait, but in the first half, 2 appears twice. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the first half: 6,4,2,1,2,3

So, 6 appears once, 4 appears once, 2 appears twice, 1 appears once, 3 appears once.

Wait, but n=6, numbers from 1 to 6 should each appear exactly twice, once in each half.

Wait, but in this array, 2 appears twice in the first half and only once in the second half, unless I'm miscounting.

Wait, second half: 1,6,3,5,5,4

So, 2 appears only once in the second half. That seems inconsistent with the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"Given an array a of length 2n, consisting of each integer from 1 to n exactly twice."

Wait, so in n=6, each number from 1 to 6 should appear exactly twice in the entire array, once in the first half and once in the second half.

Wait, but in the example, 2 appears twice in the first half and once in the second half, which violates the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"consisting of each integer from 1 to n exactly twice."

Wait, and in the example, for n=6, the array is: 6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

Let's count occurrences:

1: positions 4 and 7

2: positions 3,6

3: positions 5,8

4: positions 2,12

5: positions 10,11

6: positions 1,7

Wait, 1 appears twice, once in each half. 2 appears twice, once in each half. 3 appears twice, once in each half. 4 appears twice, once in each half. 5 appears twice, once in each half. 6 appears twice, once in each half.

Wait, but in the first half: positions 1 to 6: 6,4,2,1,2,3

So, 6 appears once, 4 appears once, 2 appears twice, 1 appears once, 3 appears once.

Wait, but according to the problem, each number should appear exactly twice, once in each half.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood.

Wait, no, the problem says: "consisting of each integer from 1 to n exactly twice." But in this example, some numbers appear twice in the first half.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the example or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant that the array contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, but not necessarily once in each half.

Wait, but the problem says: "consisting of each integer from 1 to n exactly twice."

Wait, and in the example for n=6, the array is: 6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

Let's count occurrences:

1: twice

2: twice

3: twice

4: twice

5: twice

6: twice

So, each number from 1 to 6 appears exactly twice in the entire array.

But in the first half (positions 1 to 6): 6,4,2,1,2,3

So, 2 appears twice in the first half, and only once in the second half.

Wait, but according to the problem, "each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a."

So, it's possible for a number to appear twice in the first half or twice in the second half, as long as it appears exactly twice in the entire array.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a."

It does not specify that each integer appears once in the first half and once in the second half.

Wait, that changes things.

So, in the array, each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, but they can both appear in the first half or both in the second half, or one in each.

Wait, but in the example, 2 appears twice in the first half and once in the second half, but according to the problem, it should appear exactly twice in the entire array.

Wait, in the example, 2 appears twice in the first half and once in the second half, which would make it appear three times in the entire array, which violates the problem statement.

Wait, but looking back at the example:

n=6, array: 6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

Wait, positions 1 to 6: 6,4,2,1,2,3

Positions 7 to 12: 1,6,3,5,5,4

So, 1 appears twice, once in each half. 2 appears twice, both in the first half. 3 appears twice, once in each half. 4 appears twice, once in each half. 5 appears twice, both in the second half. 6 appears twice, once in each half.

Wait, but 5 appears twice in the second half, which is allowed.

So, the problem allows both occurrences of a number to be in the same half.

Okay, that's important.

So, now, I need to find two subsets: l from the first n elements and r from the second n elements, each of size 2k, such that the XOR of elements in l equals the XOR of elements in r.

And it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists.

I need to output any such pair.

Alright, now, how to approach this.

First, I need to find subsets l and r with equal XOR.

Given that, I can think about the XOR properties.

Let me denote XOR of l as XOR(l) and XOR(r) as XOR(r).

I need XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Which is equivalent to XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0.

Because XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = XOR(l + r), where l + r is the combined list of l and r.

So, I need XOR(l + r) = 0.

But l and r are disjoint, as they come from different halves.

Wait, no, they can have common elements if the same number appears in both halves.

Wait, but according to the problem, each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, once in each half.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in a, but it doesn't specify how they are distributed between the two halves.

In the example, 2 appears twice in the first half, and 5 appears twice in the second half.

So, l and r can have overlapping elements if those elements appear in both halves.

But in the example, 2 appears only in the first half, and 5 appears only in the second half.

Wait, no, in the second test case:

n=6, k=1

array: 6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

So, first half: 6,4,2,1,2,3

second half:1,6,3,5,5,4

So, 1 appears in both halves, 2 appears only in the first half, 3 appears in both halves, 4 appears in both halves, 5 appears only in the second half, 6 appears in both halves.

Wait, but 2 appears twice in the first half, and only once in the second half, which should be allowed since it can appear twice in the first half.

Wait, but according to the problem, each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in a.

But in this array, 2 appears twice in the first half and once in the second half, which would make it appear three times in total, which violates the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I misread the array.

Wait, the array is: 6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

So, positions 1 to 6: 6,4,2,1,2,3

Positions 7 to 12:1,6,3,5,5,4

So, counts:

1: positions 4 and 7 (both halves)

2: positions 3 and 6 (both in first half)

3: positions 5 and 8 (both halves)

4: positions 2 and 12 (both halves)

5: positions 10 and 11 (both in second half)

6: positions 1 and 7 (both halves)

So, 2 appears twice in the first half and once in the second half, which would make it appear three times, violating the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the example.

Wait, perhaps the array is misprinted.

Wait, looking back at the example input:

Input:

4

2 1

1 2 2 1

6 1

6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4

4 1

1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

6 2

5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Wait, in the second test case, n=6, k=1, array:6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

So, total elements: 12, which is 2n=12, so n=6.

Looking at the array:6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

So, numbers from 1 to 6 should each appear exactly twice.

But in this array, 2 appears three times: positions 3,6, and possibly others.

Wait, positions:

1:6

2:4

3:2

4:1

5:2

6:3

7:1

8:6

9:3

10:5

11:5

12:4

Wait, positions 3:2, position 6:3, position 7:1, position 11:5, position 12:4.

Wait, but 2 appears at positions 3 and 6, and possibly others.

Wait, perhaps I need to count carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in my earlier understanding.

Wait, perhaps in the second test case, the array is:6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

So, 6 appears at positions 1 and 7

4 appears at positions 2 and 12

2 appears at positions 3 and 6

1 appears at positions 4 and 7

3 appears at positions 5 and 9

5 appears at positions 10 and 11

So, each number from 1 to 6 appears exactly twice in the array.

But in the first half: positions 1 to 6:6,4,2,1,2,3

So, 6:once,4:once,2:twice,1:once,3:once

Second half: positions 7 to 12:1,6,3,5,5,4

1:once,6:once,3:once,5:twice,4:once

So, in this case, 2 appears twice in the first half and once in the second half, but according to the counts, it appears twice in the entire array.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the example.

Wait, perhaps the array is misprinted.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo.

Wait, perhaps the array should be:6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

Wait, in this array, 2 appears twice in the first half and once in the second half, making it appear three times in total, which violates the problem statement.

Wait, unless position 7 is 1, position 8 is 6, position 9 is 3, position 10 is 5, position 11 is 5, position 12 is 4.

So, 2 appears at positions 3 and 6 (first half), and possibly position 13, but there is no position 13.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the array.

Wait, in the input, it's written as:

6 1

6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4

So, n=6, k=1, and the array has 12 elements.

Assuming that the array is correctly provided, perhaps the problem allows numbers to appear more than twice, but according to the problem statement, each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps in the second test case, the array should be:6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

So, in this array, 2 appears twice in the first half and once in the second half, which would make it appear three times in total.

But according to the problem, each integer from 1 to n should appear exactly twice.

This seems like an error in the example.

Wait, perhaps I misread the array.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a."

So, in the second test case, n=6, so numbers from 1 to 6 should each appear exactly twice.

But in the provided array:6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4

Counts:

1: positions 4 and 7

2: positions 3 and 6

3: positions 5 and 9

4: positions 2 and 12

5: positions 10 and 11

6: positions 1 and 8

So, each number appears exactly twice. I must have miscounted earlier.

Okay, now I see. Each number appears exactly twice in the entire array.

So, in the first half, some numbers appear once, and in the second half, they appear once.

But some numbers may appear twice in one half and not in the other.

Wait, but in this array, 2 appears twice in the first half and zero times in the second half.

Wait, in the array provided, 2 appears at positions 3 and 6, which are both in the first half (positions 1 to 6), and does not appear in the second half (positions 7 to 12).

Wait, positions:

1:6

2:4

3:2

4:1

5:2

6:3

7:1

8:6

9:3

10:5

11:5

12:4

So, 2 appears at positions 3 and 6, both in the first half.

In the second half, positions 7 to 12:1,6,3,5,5,4

So, 2 does not appear in the second half.

But according to the problem, each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in a.

So, in this case, 2 appears twice in the first half and zero times in the second half, which is allowed by the problem.

Wait, but in the example output, for the second test case:

6 4

1 3

So, l=[6,4], r=[1,3]

Let's check if this is valid.

First, l should be a subset of the first half:6,4,2,1,2,3

So, [6,4] is a subset of the first half.

r should be a subset of the second half:1,6,3,5,5,4

[1,3] is a subset of the second half.

Now, XOR of l:6 XOR 4 = 2 XOR 4 = 6

XOR of r:1 XOR 3 = 2 XOR 1 = 3

Wait, but 6 XOR 4 is 6, and 1 XOR 3 is 2.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 6 in binary is 110, 4 is 100.

110 XOR 100 = 010, which is 2.

1 is 001, 3 is 011.

001 XOR 011 = 010, which is 2.

So, both l and r have XOR equal to 2.

Therefore, it's a valid solution.

So, in this case, even though 2 appears twice in the first half and not in the second half, the solution doesn't involve 2, so it's fine.

Okay, now, how to approach the general problem.

I need to select subsets l and r with |l| = |r| = 2k, and XOR(l) = XOR(r).

One way to think about this is to select pairs of elements, one from l and one from r, such that their XOR contributes to the total XOR in a way that they cancel each other out.

But this seems a bit vague.

Another approach is to consider the XOR of the entire first half and the XOR of the entire second half.

Let me denote XOR1 as the XOR of the first half, and XOR2 as the XOR of the second half.

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, once in each half, XOR1 should be equal to XOR2.

Wait, but in the second test case, XOR1 is 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3

Let's compute step by step:

6 XOR 4 = 2

2 XOR 2 = 0

0 XOR 1 = 1

1 XOR 2 = 3

3 XOR 3 = 0

So, XOR1 = 0

XOR2 =1 XOR 6 XOR 3 XOR 5 XOR 5 XOR 4

1 XOR 6 = 7

7 XOR 3 = 4

4 XOR 5 = 1

1 XOR 5 = 4

4 XOR 4 = 0

So, XOR2 =0

So, in this case, XOR1 = XOR2 =0

But in the example, they selected subsets with XOR=2, which is not equal to the total XOR.

Wait, but in the example, they selected subsets with XOR=2 for both l and r.

Wait, but the total XOR of the first half is 0, and the total XOR of the second half is 0.

But the subsets have XOR=2.

Wait, but 2 is not equal to 0, so how is this allowed?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, the problem is to find subsets l and r with XOR(l) = XOR(r), not necessarily equal to the total XOR of the halves.

So, in this case, both subsets have XOR=2, which is equal to each other, even though the total XOR of the halves is 0.

So, that's fine.

Okay, now, back to the approach.

I need to find subsets l and r with |l|=|r|=2k and XOR(l)=XOR(r).

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

I know that XOR is associative and commutative.

Also, XOR of a set of elements is equal to the XOR of any permutation of those elements.

Moreover, XOR of a set of elements is equal to the XOR of their subsets.

I need to find two subsets, one from each half, with equal XOR.

One way to approach this is to select elements such that the XOR of the selected elements in l and r together is equal to the XOR of the unselected elements in l and r.

Wait, that might not be helpful.

Another approach is to fix a target XOR value and try to find subsets in l and r that both have that XOR.

But that might be too time-consuming, especially given the constraints.

Given the constraints, with n up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000, I need an efficient solution.

Let me think differently.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, once in each half, I can group the numbers into pairs.

Wait, but actually, the problem states that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in a, but it doesn't specify how they are distributed between the two halves.

In some cases, a number may appear twice in the first half or twice in the second half.

Wait, but according to the problem, "each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a."

So, for each number from 1 to n, there are two copies in the array, but they can be in the same half or in different halves.

Wait, but in the example, some numbers appear twice in one half.

So, in that case, I need to handle it accordingly.

Let me think about the XOR properties again.

Suppose I select a subset l from the first half and a subset r from the second half, both of size 2k.

I need XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Which is equivalent to XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0.

Which is equivalent to XOR(l + r) = 0, since XOR is associative and commutative.

So, I need to select l and r such that the XOR of their combined elements is zero.

Given that, perhaps I can select pairs of elements that cancel each other out in terms of XOR.

Wait, but l and r are separate subsets.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of matching XOR values.

Another idea: since I need XOR(l) = XOR(r), and both l and r have even sizes (2k), and since XOR of an even number of elements can be managed in certain ways.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements in such a way that their XOR matches.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the first and second halves.

For each number, I can look at how many times it appears in the first half and how many times in the second half.

Given that, I can categorize the numbers based on their distribution.

Let me define:

- For each number i from 1 to n:

- count_l[i]: number of times i appears in the first half.

- count_r[i]: number of times i appears in the second half.

Given that, count_l[i] + count_r[i] = 2, since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array.

So, for each number i, count_l[i] can be 0,1, or 2, and count_r[i] = 2 - count_l[i].

Now, I need to select subsets l and r with |l|=|r|=2k.

Let me think about the XOR of l and r.

I need XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Let me consider the total XOR of all elements in the first half and the second half.

Let me denote:

XOR1 = XOR of all elements in the first half.

XOR2 = XOR of all elements in the second half.

Given that, XOR1 XOR XOR2 is equal to the XOR of all elements in the array.

But since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and XOR of a number with itself is zero, the XOR of all elements in the array is zero.

Therefore, XOR1 XOR XOR2 = 0, which implies XOR1 = XOR2.

So, XOR of the first half is equal to the XOR of the second half.

That's an important observation.

Given that, I need to find subsets l and r with XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that XOR1 = XOR2, and l is a subset of the first half, r is a subset of the second half, both of size 2k.

Wait, perhaps I can use the property that XOR1 = XOR2 to find such subsets.

Let me consider that.

Let me denote:

XOR_l = XOR of l

XOR_r = XOR of r

I need XOR_l = XOR_r.

Given that, and knowing that XOR1 = XOR2, perhaps I can relate XOR_l and XOR_r to XOR1 and XOR2.

Let me think about it.

Let me denote the XOR of the elements in the first half not in l as XOR_l_complement.

Similarly, for the second half, XOR of elements not in r as XOR_r_complement.

Then, XOR_l XOR XOR_l_complement = XOR1

Similarly, XOR_r XOR XOR_r_complement = XOR2

But since XOR1 = XOR2, we have XOR_l XOR XOR_l_complement = XOR_r XOR XOR_r_complement

If I set XOR_l = XOR_r, then XOR_l_complement = XOR_r_complement

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me think differently.

I need to select subsets l and r with |l|=|r|=2k and XOR(l)=XOR(r).

Given that, and knowing that XOR1 = XOR2, perhaps I can select l and r such that their XOR is equal to some value, but I need to find a way to ensure that.

Another idea: since XOR1 = XOR2, and I need XOR(l) = XOR(r), perhaps I can select l and r such that XOR(l) = XOR(r) = XOR1.

But that might not always be possible, depending on k and the distribution of elements.

Wait, but XOR1 is the XOR of the entire first half, and XOR(l) is the XOR of a subset of the first half.

Similarly for XOR(r).

I need a way to select subsets l and r such that their XORs are equal.

Let me consider selecting pairs of identical numbers.

Wait, since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, I can have numbers that appear in both halves or only in one half.

Let me think about numbers that appear in both halves.

If a number appears once in the first half and once in the second half, then selecting both in l and r would give the same XOR contribution.

Wait, but l is a subset of the first half and r is a subset of the second half.

Wait, more carefully:

- If a number appears once in the first half and once in the second half, I can select it in l and r, and their XOR would cancel out.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements in l and 2k in r.

Wait, perhaps I can pair such numbers and select them in l and r to make their XOR equal.

Wait, but I need to select exactly 2k elements in l and 2k in r.

Let me think about it differently.

Let me consider the numbers that appear twice in the first half or twice in the second half.

For example, in the second test case, 2 appears twice in the first half.

Similarly, 5 appears twice in the second half.

I can select both copies in l or in r to make their XOR zero.

Wait, XOR of two identical numbers is zero.

So, if I select two identical numbers in l, their XOR is zero.

Similarly, if I select two identical numbers in r, their XOR is zero.

Then, if I select the same XOR in both l and r, their XOR would be equal.

Wait, perhaps I can maximize the use of such pairs to make the XOR of l and r zero.

But I need to select exactly 2k elements in l and r.

Given that, perhaps I can select pairs of identical numbers to make their XOR zero, and then adjust with other numbers to reach the required size.

Wait, but k can be up to n/2, and I need to select 2k elements in l and r.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting pairs of numbers that have the same XOR contribution in l and r.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me try to think of a simpler approach.

Given that XOR1 = XOR2, and I need XOR(l) = XOR(r), perhaps I can select l and r such that XOR(l) = XOR(r) = XOR1.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can select l and r such that XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = XOR1 XOR XOR2 = 0, which is already satisfied since XOR1 = XOR2.

But I need more than that.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a way to partition the elements into l and r such that their XORs are equal.

Let me consider that.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers and assign them to l and r in a way that maintains the equality of their XORs.

But with the constraints on the sizes of l and r, this might be tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that XOR is linear and use Gaussian elimination to find such subsets.

But given the time constraints, that might not be feasible.

Given the time constraints, with n up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

Let me think about the properties of the numbers that appear twice in one half.

If a number appears twice in one half, selecting both of them in l or r would give XOR zero for that subset.

Similarly, if a number appears once in each half, selecting one in l and one in r would give the same XOR value for both subsets.

Wait, perhaps I can categorize the numbers based on their occurrences in the halves.

Let me define:

- Type A: numbers that appear twice in the first half.

- Type B: numbers that appear twice in the second half.

- Type C: numbers that appear once in the first half and once in the second half.

Given that, for Type A numbers, I can select both copies in l to contribute XOR zero to l.

Similarly, for Type B numbers, select both copies in r to contribute XOR zero to r.

For Type C numbers, selecting one in l and one in r would contribute the same value to both XOR(l) and XOR(r).

Wait, that seems promising.

Let me formalize this.

Let me denote:

- A: list of numbers that appear twice in the first half.

- B: list of numbers that appear twice in the second half.

- C: list of numbers that appear once in the first half and once in the second half.

Given that, I can select pairs from C to match their contributions in l and r.

Wait, perhaps I can prioritize selecting pairs from A and B to make their XOR zero, and then use C to adjust the sizes if needed.

Let me think about the sizes.

I need to select 2k elements in l and 2k elements in r.

Each element is unique in the subsets, but since subsets can be any selection with possible duplicates if the number appears twice in the half.

Wait, but according to the problem, subsets are selections with possible reordering, but duplicates are allowed if the number appears multiple times in the half.

Wait, but in the subset definitions, it says "subset" in the sense of selecting elements with possible reordering and deletions.

So, for Type A numbers, which appear twice in the first half, I can select both copies for l to contribute XOR zero.

Similarly, for Type B numbers, select both copies for r to contribute XOR zero.

For Type C numbers, selecting one copy in l and one copy in r would contribute the number's value to both XOR(l) and XOR(r), thus maintaining their equality.

Given that, perhaps I can maximize the use of Type A and Type B numbers to make their XOR contributions zero, and use Type C numbers to adjust the sizes.

Wait, but I need to select exactly 2k elements in l and 2k in r.

Each pair from Type A or Type B contributes 2 elements to l or r, respectively, with XOR zero.

Each pair from Type C contributes one element to l and one to r, with XOR equal to the number's value.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs I can select from A, B, and C.

Let me define:

- pairs_A: number of Type A numbers.

- pairs_B: number of Type B numbers.

- pairs_C: number of Type C numbers.

Wait, but each number can be in at most one pair.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times I can select pairs from A, B, and C.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of pairs I can form from A, B, and C.

Given that, I can form pairs from A to select in l, pairs from B to select in r, and pairs from C to select one in l and one in r.

Each pair from A or B contributes 2 elements to l or r, respectively, with XOR zero.

Each pair from C contributes 1 element to l and 1 to r, with XOR equal to the number's value.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the total XOR of l equals the total XOR of r.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the total XOR contributions.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- For each pair from A selected: select both copies in l, contributing XOR zero to l.

- For each pair from B selected: select both copies in r, contributing XOR zero to r.

- For each pair from C selected: select one in l and one in r, contributing XOR c to both l and r, where c is the number's value.

Given that, if I select x pairs from A, y pairs from B, and z pairs from C, then:

- Total elements in l: 2x + z

- Total elements in r: 2y + z

- Total XOR of l: XOR of (all selected c's in C)

- Total XOR of r: XOR of (all selected c's in C)

So, XOR(l) = XOR(r) = XOR of selected c's in C

Therefore, to make XOR(l) = XOR(r), I just need to select the same c's in both l and r.

Wait, but in this setup, since I'm selecting one c in l and one c in r for each c in C, their XOR contributions are the same.

Therefore, as long as I select the same c's in both l and r, their XOR's will be equal.

Moreover, the total elements in l would be 2x + z, and in r would be 2y + z, and I need both to be equal to 2k.

Therefore, 2x + z = 2k and 2y + z = 2k.

From these two equations, we have:

2x + z = 2y + z => 2x = 2y => x = y

So, x = y

Therefore, I can set x = y, and choose z accordingly.

Given that, I can choose x pairs from A, x pairs from B, and z pairs from C, such that 2x + z = 2k.

Then, total elements in l: 2x + z = 2k

Total elements in r: 2x + z = 2k

And XOR(l) = XOR(r) = XOR of the selected z c's.

This seems promising.

Now, I need to choose x and z such that 2x + z = 2k.

Also, x cannot exceed the number of pairs in A and B.

Similarly, z cannot exceed the number of pairs in C.

Let me denote:

- available_A: number of Type A numbers (numbers appearing twice in the first half).

- available_B: number of Type B numbers (numbers appearing twice in the second half).

- available_C: number of Type C numbers (numbers appearing once in each half).

Then, I can choose x in [0, min(available_A, available_B)]

And z in [0, available_C]

Subject to 2x + z = 2k

I need to find non-negative integers x and z such that 2x + z = 2k, with x <= min(available_A, available_B), and z <= available_C.

This is a linear equation with constraints.

I can solve for z = 2k - 2x

Then, z needs to be between 0 and available_C, and z must be even because z = 2k - 2x = 2(k - x), so z is even.

Therefore, z is even and <= available_C.

So, I can choose x such that x <= min(available_A, available_B), and z = 2(k - x) <= available_C, with k - x >= 0.

Therefore, x <= k, and z = 2(k - x)

So, z = 2(k - x) <= available_C

Therefore, k - x <= available_C / 2

So, x >= k - floor(available_C / 2)

Also, x <= min(available_A, available_B)

And x <= k

So, x should be in [max(0, k - floor(available_C / 2)), min(k, min(available_A, available_B))]

If this interval is non-empty, then I can choose such x.

Given that, I can iterate over possible x and choose the one that fits.

Once I have x and z, I can select:

- 2x elements from A in l (selecting both copies of x Type A numbers).

- 2x elements from B in r (selecting both copies of x Type B numbers).

- z elements from C: select one copy in l and one copy in r.

Wait, but z is the number of Type C numbers to select.

Wait, but z is the number of pairs from C to select, but since each pair in C corresponds to selecting one in l and one in r.

Wait, no, C consists of numbers that appear once in each half.

So, for each c in C, I can select one in l and one in r.

Therefore, for z such numbers, I select one in l and one in r, contributing z elements to l and z elements to r.

But in terms of pairs, each c in C is a pair consisting of one in l and one in r.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of z as the number of Type C numbers to select.

Given that, for each selected c in C, I select one in l and one in r.

Therefore, z elements from C are selected in l and z in r.

But each selection in l and r corresponds to one c.

Wait, perhaps I need to select z Type C numbers, and for each, select their copy in l and their copy in r.
