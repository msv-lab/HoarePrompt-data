Alright, I have this problem to solve. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, which is specified by p_i. The key points are:

1. All p_i are distinct and p_i != i, meaning no one is their own best friend, and everyone has a unique best friend.

2. A friend comes to the party only if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

3. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come to the party, and he wants to send the minimum number of invitations to achieve this.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends. Since each friend has a unique best friend and p_i are distinct, it means that the friendships are paired uniquely. For example, if friend 1's best friend is 3, then friend 3's best friend must be 1, because if friend 3's best friend was someone else, it would violate the uniqueness of p_i.

Wait, but the problem says that all p_i are distinct, and p_i != i. So, does that mean that the best friendships are unique and form pairs? Let me think about that.

Take the first example:

n = 5

p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]

So, friend 1's best friend is 3, friend 2's is 1, friend 3's is 2, friend 4's is 5, and friend 5's is 4.

Here, friends 1, 2, and 3 form a cycle because 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1. Similarly, friends 4 and 5 are a pair: 4 -> 5 -> 4.

Wait, but the problem says that all p_i are distinct, so in this case, p_i are unique, meaning that no two friends have the same best friend.

Wait, in the first example, p = [3,1,2,5,4], which are all distinct.

So, in general, the friendships form cycles where each cycle is a sequence of friends pointing to their best friends without any duplicates.

Given that, I need to find the minimum number of invitations to send such that at least two friends come to the party, and a friend comes only if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

Let me try to rephrase the condition for a friend to come: for friend i to come, both i and p_i must receive invitations.

But, importantly, the friend's best friend p_i might or might not come, depending on whether p_i and p_{p_i} both receive invitations.

Wait, but the condition is only about i and p_i receiving invitations for i to come. It doesn't directly depend on whether p_i comes or not, just that p_i received an invitation.

So, for friend i to come, two conditions must be met:

1. i receives an invitation.

2. p_i receives an invitation.

That's it.

So, if I invite both i and p_i, then i will come. Similarly, p_i will come only if p_i receives an invitation and p_{p_i} receives an invitation.

Wait, but p_{p_i} is i, because in the example, p_{1} = 3, p_{3} = 2, p_{2} = 1.

Wait, in the first example, p_{1} = 3, p_{3} = 2, p_{2} = 1.

So, in this cycle, if I invite 1 and 3, then friend 1 will come because 1 and 3 are invited. Friend 3 will come because 3 and 2 are invited. Friend 2 will come because 2 and 1 are invited.

So, if I invite 1, 2, and 3, then all three will come.

But in the example, it says that inviting 4 and 5 is sufficient for friends 4 and 5 to come, but according to the condition, friend 4 will come if both 4 and 5 are invited, and friend 5 will come if both 5 and 4 are invited. So, both will come if I invite both 4 and 5.

Wait, but in the first example, the solution says that inviting 4 and 5 makes friends 2,4,5 come. Wait, no, in the first example, it says:

"the friends [2,4,5] will come to the party."

Wait, let's read the example again:

"The friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation."

Wait, no, in the first example, Monocarp sends invitations to [1,2,4,5], and the friends who come are [2,4,5].

Wait, why doesn't friend 1 come? Because friend 1 requires that both 1 and 3 are invited. 1 is invited, but 3 is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

Friend 2 requires that both 2 and 1 are invited. 2 and 1 are both invited, so friend 2 comes.

Friend 3 requires that both 3 and 2 are invited. 3 is not invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

Friend 4 requires that both 4 and 5 are invited. 4 and 5 are both invited, so friend 4 comes.

Friend 5 requires that both 5 and 4 are invited. 5 and 4 are both invited, so friend 5 comes.

So, friends 2,4,5 come.

But the problem says that at least 2 friends come, and we need to minimize the number of invitations sent.

So, in this case, sending invitations to 4 and 5 (which are a pair) makes both come, plus friend 2 comes because 2 and 1 are both invited.

Wait, but in this case, inviting 4 and 5 makes friends 4 and 5 come, and friend 2 comes because 2 and 1 are both invited.

Wait, but in the first example, it says that inviting [1,2,4,5] makes friends [2,4,5] come.

But, is there a way to invite fewer than 3 friends and still have at least 2 come?

Wait, in the first example, the solution says that inviting 4 and 5 is sufficient to have 2 friends come (4 and 5).

But, according to the condition, friend 4 comes only if both 4 and 5 are invited, and friend 5 comes only if both 5 and 4 are invited.

So, inviting 4 and 5 makes both come, which satisfies the condition of having at least 2 friends come.

Is there a way to invite fewer than 2 friends and have at least 2 come? No, because if you invite only one friend, say 4, then friend 4 requires both 4 and 5 to be invited to come, which isn't the case since 5 is not invited. Similarly for any single invitation.

Hence, in this case, the minimum number of invitations is 2.

In the second test case:

n = 4

p = [2,3,4,1]

So, friend 1's best friend is 2, friend 2's is 3, friend 3's is 4, and friend 4's is 1.

This forms a cycle of length 4: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.

The solution says that inviting 1,2,3 makes friends 1 and 2 come.

Let's see:

Invite 1,2,3.

Friend 1 comes if both 1 and 2 are invited: yes.

Friend 2 comes if both 2 and 3 are invited: yes.

Friend 3 comes if both 3 and 4 are invited: 3 is invited, but 4 is not invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

Friend 4 comes if both 4 and 1 are invited: 4 is not invited, so friend 4 doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Similarly, inviting 1,2,4 would make friends 1,2,4 come.

Wait, but friend 4 requires both 4 and 1 to be invited, which are both invited, so friend 4 comes.

Friend 1 comes because 1 and 2 are invited.

Friend 2 comes because 2 and 3 are invited.

Friend 3 comes if both 3 and 4 are invited: 3 is not invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

So, friends 1,2,4 come.

But the solution says that it's impossible to have at least 2 friends come with fewer than 3 invitations.

Is there a way to invite fewer than 3 and have at least 2 come?

Let's try inviting 1 and 2.

Then, friend 1 requires 1 and 2: both invited, so friend 1 comes.

Friend 2 requires 2 and 3: 2 is invited, but 3 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

Friend 3 requires 3 and 4: 3 is not invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

Friend 4 requires 4 and 1: 4 is not invited, so friend 4 doesn't come.

So, only friend 1 comes, which is less than 2.

Another attempt: invite 2 and 3.

Friend 2 requires 2 and 3: both invited, so friend 2 comes.

Friend 3 requires 3 and 4: 3 is invited, but 4 is not invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

Friend 1 requires 1 and 2: 2 is invited, but 1 is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

Friend 4 requires 4 and 1: not invited, so friend 4 doesn't come.

Only friend 2 comes.

Another attempt: invite 3 and 4.

Friend 3 requires 3 and 4: both invited, so friend 3 comes.

Friend 4 requires 4 and 1: 4 is invited, but 1 is not invited, so friend 4 doesn't come.

Friend 1 requires 1 and 2: not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

Friend 2 requires 2 and 3: 3 is invited, but 2 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

Only friend 3 comes.

So, with 2 invitations, only one friend comes. Hence, we need to invite at least 3 friends to have at least 2 come.

In the third test case:

n = 2

p = [2,1]

So, friend 1's best friend is 2, and friend 2's best friend is 1.

Inviting both 1 and 2 makes both come, since each requires the other to be invited.

Inviting only one, say 1, makes friend 1 not come because 2 is not invited, and friend 2 requires 2 and 1 to be invited, but 2 is invited and 1 is invited, so friend 2 comes.

But friend 1 doesn't come because 2 is not invited.

So, only friend 2 comes.

Similarly, inviting only 2 makes friend 2 come, and inviting only 1 makes friend 2 come (but friend 1 doesn't come because 2 is not invited).

Hence, to have at least 2 friends come, we need to invite both 1 and 2, and both will come.

So, the minimum number of invitations is 2.

From these examples, it seems that the minimum number of invitations needed is either 2 or 3, depending on the structure of the friendships.

I need to find a general approach to determine the minimum number of invitations for any given n and p.

First, I need to understand the structure of the friendships.

Given that p_i are distinct and p_i != i, this forms a permutation of the friends where no one is fixed.

In permutation theory, such a permutation is a derangement.

In this derangement, cycles can be of any length, but since p_i are distinct and p_i != i, cycles are of length at least 2.

So, the friendships form disjoint cycles.

For example, in the first test case, there are two cycles: one of length 3 (1->3->2->1) and one of length 2 (4->5->4).

In the second test case, there is one cycle of length 4: 1->2->3->4->1.

In the third test case, there is one cycle of length 2: 1->2->1.

Given this, I need to find a way to select a subset of friends to invite such that at least two friends come to the party, and the number of invitations is minimized.

From the examples, it seems that in some cases, inviting 2 friends is sufficient, and in others, inviting 3 friends is necessary.

I need to find a condition to determine when inviting 2 friends is sufficient and when inviting 3 friends is necessary.

Looking back at the first test case, where n=5 and p=[3,1,2,5,4], which has cycles of length 3 and 2, inviting 4 and 5 (from the cycle of length 2) makes friends 4 and 5 come.

In this case, inviting two friends from a cycle of length 2 is sufficient to have two friends come.

In the second test case, n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], which has one cycle of length 4.

Inviting any two friends doesn't seem to be sufficient, as shown in the earlier attempts.

Inviting three friends is necessary to have at least two come.

In the third test case, n=2, p=[2,1], which has one cycle of length 2.

Inviting both friends makes both come.

So, it seems that:

- If there is a cycle of length 2, inviting 2 friends from that cycle is sufficient to have 2 friends come.

- If all cycles are of length greater than 2, inviting 3 friends is necessary.

Wait, but in the first test case, there is a cycle of length 2, and inviting 2 friends from that cycle is sufficient.

In the second test case, there is only a cycle of length 4, and inviting 3 friends is necessary.

In the third test case, there is a cycle of length 2, and inviting 2 friends is sufficient.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If there exists a cycle of length 2, then inviting 2 friends from that cycle is sufficient.

- If all cycles are of length greater than 2, then inviting 3 friends is necessary.

Is this always true?

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=3, p=[2,3,1].

This forms one cycle of length 3: 1->2->3->1.

If I invite 1 and 2, then:

- Friend 1 requires 1 and 2: both invited, so friend 1 comes.

- Friend 2 requires 2 and 3: 2 is invited, but 3 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

- Friend 3 requires 3 and 1: 3 is not invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

Only friend 1 comes.

If I invite 1 and 3:

- Friend 1 requires 1 and 2: 1 is invited, but 2 is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

- Friend 3 requires 3 and 1: both invited, so friend 3 comes.

Only friend 3 comes.

If I invite 2 and 3:

- Friend 2 requires 2 and 3: both invited, so friend 2 comes.

- Friend 3 requires 3 and 1: 3 is invited, but 1 is not invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

Only friend 2 comes.

So, with two invitations, only one friend comes.

If I invite 1,2,3:

- Friend 1 requires 1 and 2: both invited, so friend 1 comes.

- Friend 2 requires 2 and 3: both invited, so friend 2 comes.

- Friend 3 requires 3 and 1: both invited, so friend 3 comes.

All three friends come.

So, in this case, inviting three friends is necessary to have at least two friends come.

This aligns with the earlier hypothesis: if all cycles are of length greater than 2, inviting three friends is necessary.

Now, let's consider another case where there are multiple cycles.

Suppose n=4, p=[2,1,4,3].

This has two cycles of length 2: 1->2->1 and 3->4->3.

If I invite 1 and 2, then friends 1 and 2 come.

Similarly, if I invite 3 and 4, friends 3 and 4 come.

If I invite 1 and 3, then friend 1 comes (since 1 and 2 are invited), and friend 3 comes (since 3 and 4 are invited).

Wait, but in this case, inviting 1 and 3 makes friends 1 and 3 come, since their best friends are invited.

Wait, no.

Wait, friend 1 requires 1 and 2 to be invited. If I invite 1 and 3, then 1 is invited, but 2 is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

Friend 3 requires 3 and 4 to be invited. If I invite 3 and 1, but not 4, then friend 3 doesn't come.

So, in this case, inviting 1 and 3 doesn't make any friends come.

Similarly, inviting 1 and 4: friend 1 requires 1 and 2, but 2 is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come. Friend 4 requires 4 and 3, but 3 is not invited, so friend 4 doesn't come.

No friends come.

Hence, to have at least two friends come, I need to invite both friends from one cycle.

For example, inviting 1 and 2 makes friends 1 and 2 come.

Similarly, inviting 3 and 4 makes friends 3 and 4 come.

So, in this case, inviting 2 friends is sufficient to have 2 friends come, because there are cycles of length 2.

This aligns with the earlier hypothesis.

Therefore, the general rule seems to be:

- If there exists at least one cycle of length 2 in the friendship graph, then the minimum number of invitations needed is 2.

- If all cycles are of length greater than 2, then the minimum number of invitations needed is 3.

Hence, to solve the problem, I need to detect if there is any cycle of length 2 in the permutation.

If there is at least one cycle of length 2, then the answer is 2; otherwise, it's 3.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

v = [0] * (n + 1)

v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if v[v[i]] == i:

print(2)

return

print(3)

So, it reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it calls func_1.

In func_1:

- Read n

- Read the permutation p into v, with v[0] = 0 (probably for 1-based indexing)

- For each i from 1 to n, check if v[v[i]] == i

- If yes, print 2 and return

- If no such i is found, print 3

So, it's checking for each i whether v[v[i]] == i.

In the context of permutations, v[v[i]] == i means that v_i is a friend such that v_{v_i} = i, which is the definition of a cycle of length 2.

For example, if v[1] = 3 and v[3] = 1, then v[v[1]] = v[3] = 1, which matches i=1.

Similarly, in the first test case:

v = [0,3,1,2,5,4]

v[v[1]] = v[3] = 2 != 1

v[v[2]] = v[1] = 3 != 2

v[v[3]] = v[2] = 1 != 3

v[v[4]] = v[5] = 4 == 4

So, for i=4, v[v[4]] == 4, which indicates a cycle of length 2: 4 and 5.

Hence, it prints 2.

In the second test case:

v = [0,2,3,4,1]

v[v[1]] = v[2] = 3 !=1

v[v[2]] = v[3] =4 !=2

v[v[3]] = v[4] =1 !=3

v[v[4]] = v[1] =2 !=4

So, no i where v[v[i]] == i, meaning no cycle of length 2, so it prints 3.

In the third test case:

v = [0,2,1]

v[v[1]] = v[2] =1 ==1

So, i=1 satisfies v[v[1]] ==1, so it prints 2.

This aligns perfectly with the earlier reasoning.

Hence, the program correctly implements the logic to check for cycles of length 2 and prints 2 if such a cycle exists, otherwise prints 3.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{2}\]
