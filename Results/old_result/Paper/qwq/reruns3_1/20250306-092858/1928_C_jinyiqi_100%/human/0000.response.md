Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and getting assigned numbers based on their positions and some parameter k. The task is to help Vasya remember possible values of k given his position n and the number x he received.

First, I need to understand how the numbering works. It says that the first k people get numbers 1 through k, then the next k-2 people get numbers k-1 down to 2, and this pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.

So, for example, if k=3, the sequence would be:

Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...

Numbers: 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2...

And the cycle repeats every 4 positions (since 2k-2=4 when k=3).

Another example in the problem: for k=2, the sequence is 1 2 1 2 1 2...

For k=3: 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1...

For k=5: 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 2...

For k=6: 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2...

So, the pattern is:

- First k numbers: 1 to k

- Next k-2 numbers: k-1 down to 2

- This cycle repeats every 2k-2 positions.

Given n (Vasya's position) and x (the number he received), I need to find all possible k >1 that satisfy these conditions.

Constraints:

- k >1

- n and x are integers with 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9

- t is the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100

Output for each test case is the number of different k that fit the constraints.

First, I need to find a way to model this repeating pattern for any given k and determine for which k the n-th position gets the number x.

Let's think about the structure of the sequence for a given k.

For a given k:

- The sequence repeats every 2k-2 positions.

- Within each cycle:

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 down to 2

So, for position n, I need to find its position within its cycle.

Let’s define:

- cycle_length = 2k -2

- cycle_number = floor((n-1)/(2k-2)) +1

- position_in_cycle = n - (cycle_number -1)*cycle_length

But actually, since the sequence repeats every cycle, I can consider n modulo cycle_length.

But need to be careful with modulo operation when n is a multiple of cycle_length.

So, let’s compute:

- adjusted_n = n mod cycle_length

- if adjusted_n ==0, then adjusted_n = cycle_length

Then, within the cycle:

- If adjusted_n <=k, then number is adjusted_n

- Else, number is cycle_length - adjusted_n +2

Wait, let's see:

For k=3, cycle_length=4

Positions in cycle: 1,2,3,2

So,

adjusted_n=1 -> number=1

adjusted_n=2 -> number=2

adjusted_n=3 -> number=3

adjusted_n=4 -> number=2

Similarly, for k=2, cycle_length=2

adjusted_n=1 -> number=1

adjusted_n=2 -> number=2

For k=4, cycle_length=6

Positions in cycle: 1,2,3,4,3,2

So, general formula:

If adjusted_n <=k, number=adjusted_n

Else, number= cycle_length - adjusted_n +2

Wait, for k=3, cycle_length=4

If adjusted_n=4, number=4 -4 +2=2, which matches the sequence.

For k=4, cycle_length=6

If adjusted_n=6, number=6-6+2=2, which matches.

So, the general formula seems correct.

So, for a given k, I can compute:

cycle_length =2*k -2

adjusted_n =n mod cycle_length

if adjusted_n ==0, adjusted_n =cycle_length

then,

if adjusted_n <=k, number=adjusted_n

else, number=cycle_length -adjusted_n +2

I need this number to be equal to x.

So, for each k>1, I can compute the number at position n and check if it equals x.

But since n and k can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to find all k that satisfy the condition.

I need to find all k>1 such that the number at position n is x.

Given that, I need to solve for k in the equation based on the above rules.

Let me try to formulate the condition mathematically.

Given:

cycle_length =2*k -2

adjusted_n =n mod cycle_length

if adjusted_n ==0, adjusted_n =cycle_length

if adjusted_n <=k, number=adjusted_n

else, number=cycle_length -adjusted_n +2

We need number ==x

So, two cases:

1. adjusted_n <=k ⇒ adjusted_n ==x

2. adjusted_n >k ⇒ cycle_length -adjusted_n +2 ==x

In both cases, I need to find k such that these equalities hold.

But adjusted_n depends on k, since it's n mod (2k-2).

This seems complicated. Maybe I can iterate over possible k and check the condition, but with n up to 1e9, I need a smarter approach.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case: n=10, x=2

Possible k:2,3,5,6 → output=4

Second test case: n=3, x=1 → k=2 → output=1

Third test case: n=76, x=4 → output=9

Fourth: n=100, x=99 → output=0

Fifth: n=1e9, x=5e8 → output=1

I need an efficient way to compute the number of k for each test case.

Let me think about the general approach.

I need to find all k >1 such that the number at position n is x.

Given the periodicity, I can think in terms of the cycle length, which is 2k-2.

So, for each k, the sequence repeats every 2k-2 positions.

I need to find k such that in the sequence, at position n, the number is x.

Given the cycle, n modulo (2k-2) gives the position within the cycle.

If n mod (2k-2) ==0, then it's at position 2k-2.

Else, it's n mod (2k-2).

Then, as above, if this position <=k, number equals the position.

Else, number equals (2k-2) - position +2.

I need this number to be equal to x.

So, for each k>1, I can set up the equation based on the above logic and solve for k.

But since k is unknown, I need to find k such that:

Case 1: position <=k ⇒ position ==x

position = n mod (2k-2)

If n mod (2k-2) <=k, then n mod (2k-2) ==x

Case 2: position >k ⇒ (2k-2) - position +2 ==x

position = n mod (2k-2)

So, (2k-2) - (n mod (2k-2)) +2 ==x

Simplify: 2k -2 - n mod (2k-2) +2 ==x ⇒ 2k - n mod (2k-2) ==x

So, two equations:

1. n mod (2k-2) ==x (when position <=k)

2. 2k - n mod (2k-2) ==x (when position >k)

I need to solve for k in both cases.

But n mod (2k-2) is n - floor(n/(2k-2))*(2k-2)

So, it's complicated to solve directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of congruences.

Let’s denote m=2k-2.

So, m=2k-2 ⇒ k=(m+2)/2

Since k>1, m>=2.

So, k=(m+2)/2, and m is even because k is integer.

Wait, k can be integer or real? Wait, k must be integer, as it's a count of people.

Wait, looking back at the problem, it says "the first k people", so k must be an integer greater than 1.

So, m=2k-2, where k is integer >=2.

So, m is even, since 2k-2 is even for integer k.

So, m>=2 and m is even.

Now, position = n mod m

If position <=k, number=position

Else, number=m -position +2

We need number ==x

So, two cases:

1. position <=k ⇒ position ==x

2. position >k ⇒ m -position +2 ==x

In terms of m:

k=(m+2)/2

So, in case 1:

n mod m <= (m+2)/2 ⇒ n mod m ==x

In case 2:

n mod m > (m+2)/2 ⇒ m - (n mod m) +2 ==x

Let’s denote p =n mod m

So,

Case 1: p <= (m+2)/2 ⇒ p ==x

Case 2: p > (m+2)/2 ⇒ m -p +2 ==x

I need to find m such that either of these holds.

But m=2k-2, and k >=2.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express in terms of m.

Given that, m is even, m >=2.

Let’s express p =n mod m

Then,

If p <= (m+2)/2, then p ==x

Else, m -p +2 ==x

I need to find m such that one of these is true.

But m=2k-2, so k=(m+2)/2

Since k must be integer, m must be even.

So, m can be 2,4,6,... up to some maximum value.

I need to find all even m >=2 such that p =n mod m, and either:

- p <= (m+2)/2 and p ==x

- p > (m+2)/2 and m -p +2 ==x

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

First test case: n=10, x=2 → k=2,3,5,6 → output=4

Let’s verify for k=2:

m=2*2-2=2

p=10 mod 2=0 → since p=0, which is <=k=2, but p=0 !=x=2 → doesn't satisfy.

Wait, but in the earlier explanation, adjusted_n= n mod m, and if 0, set to m.

So, p=0 ⇒ adjusted_n=m=2

Then, since 2 <=k=2, number=2==x=2 → satisfies.

So, for k=2, it satisfies.

Similarly, for k=3:

m=4

p=10 mod 4=2

2 <=3 ⇒ p=2==x=2 → satisfies.

For k=5:

m=8

p=10 mod 8=2

2 <=5 ⇒ p=2==x=2 → satisfies.

For k=6:

m=10

p=10 mod 10=0 ⇒ adjusted_n=10

10 >6 ⇒ number=10-10+2=2==x=2 → satisfies.

So, in this case, k=2,3,5,6 satisfy.

Similarly, for n=3, x=1:

k=2:

m=2

p=3 mod 2=1

1 <=2 ⇒ p=1==x=1 → satisfies.

So, only k=2 satisfies.

For n=76, x=4, output=9

For n=100, x=99, output=0

For n=1e9, x=5e8, output=1

I need to find a general way to compute the number of k for given n and x.

Let me try to find a mathematical relationship.

Let’s consider the two cases separately.

Case 1: p <=k ⇒ p==x

So, p=x and p <=k

Case 2: p >k ⇒ m -p +2 ==x

Which is 2k -2 -p +2 ==x ⇒ 2k -p ==x ⇒ p=2k -x

But p =n mod m =n mod (2k-2)

So, in case 1: n mod (2k-2) ==x and n mod (2k-2) <=k

In case 2: n mod (2k-2) ==2k -x and n mod (2k-2) >k

I need to find k such that either:

1. n mod (2k-2) ==x and n mod (2k-2) <=k

2. n mod (2k-2) ==2k -x and n mod (2k-2) >k

This seems complicated to solve directly for k.

Maybe I can express n in terms of m.

Let’s set m=2k-2, so k=(m+2)/2

Then, n mod m ==x and x <= (m+2)/2

Or n mod m ==2*( (m+2)/2 ) -x and x < (m+2)/2

Wait, this seems messy.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider that n can be expressed as q*(2k-2) + p, where p=n mod (2k-2)

Then, number at position n is:

If p <=k, number=p

Else, number=2k -p +2

I need number==x

So, two cases:

1. p <=k ⇒ p==x

2. p >k ⇒ 2k -p +2 ==x

In both cases, I need to express in terms of k and solve for k.

Let’s consider both cases separately.

Case 1: p <=k ⇒ p==x

Since p=n mod (2k-2), we have n mod (2k-2) ==x and x <=k

Which implies n ≡x mod (2k-2)

And x <=k

Similarly, case 2: p >k ⇒ 2k -p +2 ==x

With p=n mod (2k-2) and p >k

So, n mod (2k-2) ==2k -x

And 2k -x >k ⇒ k >x

So, k >x

From case 1: n ≡x mod (2k-2) and x <=k

From case 2: n ≡2k -x mod (2k-2) and k >x

I need to find k such that either:

1. n ≡x mod (2k-2) and x <=k

2. n ≡2k -x mod (2k-2) and k >x

This still seems tricky to solve directly for k.

Maybe I can consider that m=2k-2, then k=(m+2)/2

Then, for case 1: n ≡x mod m and x <= (m+2)/2

Case 2: n ≡2*( (m+2)/2 ) -x mod m and (m+2)/2 >x

But m must be even, since m=2k-2 and k is integer.

So, m=2k-2, m>=2, m even.

Let’s set m=2k-2, where m>=2 and even.

Then, k=(m+2)/2

Now, in terms of m:

Case 1: n ≡x mod m and x <= (m+2)/2

Case 2: n ≡2*( (m+2)/2 ) -x mod m and (m+2)/2 >x

Simplify case 2:

n ≡m +2 -x mod m

But m +2 -x mod m ==2 -x mod m

But this seems off.

Wait, 2*( (m+2)/2 ) -x = m +2 -x

So, n ≡m +2 -x mod m

But m +2 -x mod m ==2 -x mod m

But 2 -x mod m must be equal to n mod m

This seems confusing.

Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Let’s consider that for a given m=2k-2, where m is even and m>=2.

Then, for case 1: n ≡x mod m and x <= (m+2)/2

For case 2: n ≡2k -x mod m and k >x

But k=(m+2)/2

So, 2k -x = m +2 -x

Thus, n ≡m +2 -x mod m, which is equivalent to n ≡2 -x mod m

But since m is even, and m>=2.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that m divides n -x in case 1 and n - (2k -x) in case 2.

Wait, more carefully:

From case 1: n ≡x mod m

Which means m divides n -x

From case 2: n ≡2k -x mod m

But 2k -x = m +2 -x

So, n ≡m +2 -x mod m ⇒ n ≡2 -x mod m

Which means m divides n - (2 -x)

So, for case 1: m divides n -x and x <= (m+2)/2

For case 2: m divides n - (2 -x) and (m+2)/2 >x

Since m=2k-2, and k>=2, m>=2, and m is even.

So, I need to find all even m >=2 such that either:

1. m divides n -x and x <= (m+2)/2

2. m divides n - (2 -x) and (m+2)/2 >x

Then, for each such m, k=(m+2)/2

Since k must be integer, m must be even.

Given that, I can iterate over all possible m that divide either n -x or n - (2 -x), and check the additional conditions.

But n - (2 -x) = n -2 +x

So, I need to consider divisors of n -x and n -2 +x.

But m must be even and >=2.

So, the plan is:

For each test case:

- Compute d1 =n -x

- Compute d2 =n -2 +x

- Find all even m >=2 that divide d1, and for each, check if x <= (m+2)/2

- Find all even m >=2 that divide d2, and for each, check if x < (m+2)/2

- Count the total number of such m, and then k=(m+2)/2 for each valid m

- Output the count

This seems efficient, as finding divisors of d1 and d2 can be done in O(sqrt(d)) time.

Given that n and x are up to 1e9, and t up to 100, this should be efficient enough.

Let’s verify this approach with the first sample input.

First test case: n=10, x=2

Compute d1 =10 -2=8

d2 =10 -2 +2=10

Find even m >=2 that divide 8 or 10, and satisfy the conditions.

For d1=8:

Divisors of 8: 1,2,4,8

Even m >=2: 2,4,8

Check for each:

m=2: x=2 <= (2+2)/2=2 → true

m=4: x=2 <= (4+2)/2=3 → true

m=8: x=2 <= (8+2)/2=5 → true

So, all three m=2,4,8 are valid for d1.

For d2=10:

Divisors of 10: 1,2,5,10

Even m >=2: 2,10

Check for each:

m=2: x=2 < (2+2)/2=2 → false (2 < 2 is false)

m=10: x=2 < (10+2)/2=6 → 2 < 6 is true

So, only m=10 is valid for d2.

Total valid m: 2,4,8,10

Then, k=(m+2)/2: for m=2, k=2; m=4, k=3; m=8, k=5; m=10, k=6

Which matches the first sample output of 4.

Second test case: n=3, x=1

d1=3-1=2

d2=3-2+1=2

For d1=2:

m=2: x=1 <= (2+2)/2=2 → true

For d2=2:

m=2: x=1 < (2+2)/2=2 → true

But m=2 is counted in both, but since k=(2+2)/2=2, and it's only one k, output should be 1.

Wait, but in the earlier approach, m=2 is counted once, so output=1.

Third test case: n=76, x=4

Compute d1=76-4=72

d2=76-2+4=78

Find even m >=2 that divide 72 or 78, and satisfy the conditions.

Divisors of 72: 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72

Even m:2,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72

Check x=4 <= (m+2)/2

For m=2: (2+2)/2=2, 4 <=2? No

m=4: (4+2)/2=3, 4 <=3? No

m=6: (6+2)/2=4, 4 <=4? Yes

m=8: (8+2)/2=5, 4 <=5? Yes

m=12: (12+2)/2=7, 4 <=7? Yes

m=18: (18+2)/2=10, 4 <=10? Yes

m=24: (24+2)/2=13, 4 <=13? Yes

m=36: (36+2)/2=19, 4 <=19? Yes

m=72: (72+2)/2=37, 4 <=37? Yes

So, all m >=6 are valid for d1.

For d2=78:

Divisors of 78:1,2,3,6,13,26,39,78

Even m:2,6,26,78

Check x=4 < (m+2)/2

For m=2: (2+2)/2=2, 4 <2? No

m=6: (6+2)/2=4, 4 <4? No

m=26: (26+2)/2=14, 4 <14? Yes

m=78: (78+2)/2=40, 4 <40? Yes

So, m=26 and m=78 are valid for d2.

Total valid m from d1:6,8,12,18,24,36,72

From d2:26,78

So, total m:6,8,12,18,24,36,72,26,78 → 9 values, matching the sample output.

Fourth test case: n=100, x=99

d1=100-99=1

d2=100-2+99=197

Find even m >=2 that divide 1 or 197, and satisfy conditions.

Divisors of 1:1

No even m >=2 divide 1.

Divisors of 197:1,197

No even m >=2 divide 197.

So, output=0, matches the sample.

Fifth test case: n=1e9, x=5e8

d1=1e9 -5e8=5e8

d2=1e9 -2 +5e8=1.5e9 -2

Find even m >=2 that divide 5e8 or 1.5e9 -2, and satisfy conditions.

But in the sample output, it's 1, so likely only one m satisfies.

Given time constraints, I'll assume the approach is correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need a function to find all even divisors m >=2 of a given number d.

I can write a function to find all divisors of d, then filter for even m >=2.

Then, for d1 and d2, find such m, and check the conditions.

Finally, count the total number of valid m, and output the count.

Edge cases to consider:

- When d1 or d2 is zero.

- When m=2.

- When k is not integer, but since m=2k-2 and m is even, k is integer.

- When x=1 or x=k.

- When n=x, but n >x as per constraints.

Wait, constraints say 1 <=x <n <=1e9, so x <n.

So, x <n, which implies d1=n -x >0, and d2=n -2 +x can be positive or negative.

Wait, d2=n -2 +x.

Given x <n, d2=n -2 +x can be less than or equal to 2n -2.

But need to ensure d2 is positive for finding divisors.

Wait, if d2 <=0, then no m divides d2, as m >=2.

So, for d2, consider only when d2 >0.

Hence, in implementation, only consider d2 if d2 >0.

Let’s confirm with sample input.

First test case: n=10, x=2

d1=8 >0

d2=10 -2 +2=10 >0

Second test case: n=3, x=1

d1=2 >0

d2=3 -2 +1=2 >0

Third: n=76, x=4

d1=72 >0

d2=76 -2 +4=78 >0

Fourth: n=100, x=99

d1=1 >0

d2=100 -2 +99=197 >0

Fifth: n=1e9, x=5e8

d1=5e8 >0

d2=1e9 -2 +5e8=1.5e9 -2 >0

So, in all cases d2 >0.

Hence, always consider both d1 and d2.

Now, proceed to implement the function to find all even divisors m >=2 of a given number d.

Implement a function that, given d, returns all even divisors m >=2.

To find all divisors of d, iterate up to sqrt(d), and collect pairs of divisors.

Then, filter for even m >=2.

Then, for d1 and d2, get the lists of m, check the conditions, and count unique m.

But need to ensure that m is counted only once, even if it appears in both lists.

Hence, use a set to store unique m that satisfy either condition.

Then, output the size of the set.

Implementing this should work.

Now, considering time constraints, since t <=100 and d1, d2 <=2n <=2e9, and finding divisors takes O(sqrt(d)) time, which for d=1e9 is around 3e4 operations, which is acceptable for t=100, total operations around 3e6, which is fine.

Hence, proceed with this approach.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) that satisfy the given conditions based on Vasya's position in the line and the number he received during the settling.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received.
   - We need to find all \( k \) such that the number assigned to Vasya at position \( n \) is \( x \), following the specified settling pattern.

2. **Settling Pattern:**
   - The sequence repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - Within each cycle:
     - Positions 1 to \( k \): numbers 1 to \( k \)
     - Positions \( k+1 \) to \( 2k-2 \): numbers \( k-1 \) down to 2

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - For a given \( k \), compute the cycle length \( m = 2k - 2 \).
   - Determine the position within the cycle: \( \text{adjusted}_n = n \mod m \). If \( \text{adjusted}_n = 0 \), set \( \text{adjusted}_n = m \).
   - If \( \text{adjusted}_n \leq k \), the number is \( \text{adjusted}_n \).
   - Else, the number is \( m - \text{adjusted}_n + 2 \).

4. **Conditions for \( k \):**
   - **Case 1:** \( \text{adjusted}_n \leq k \) and \( \text{adjusted}_n = x \)
     - This implies \( n \mod m = x \) and \( x \leq k \)
   - **Case 2:** \( \text{adjusted}_n > k \) and \( m - \text{adjusted}_n + 2 = x \)
     - This implies \( n \mod m = 2k - x \) and \( k > x \)

5. **Efficient Calculation:**
   - Let \( m = 2k - 2 \). Then \( k = \frac{m + 2}{2} \).
   - For **Case 1:** \( m \) divides \( n - x \) and \( x \leq \frac{m + 2}{2} \)
   - For **Case 2:** \( m \) divides \( n - (2 - x) \) and \( \frac{m + 2}{2} > x \)
   - We need to find all even \( m \geq 2 \) that satisfy these conditions.

6. **Implementation:**
   - Compute \( d1 = n - x \) and \( d2 = n - 2 + x \)
   - Find all even divisors \( m \geq 2 \) of \( d1 \) and \( d2 \)
   - Check the additional conditions for each \( m \)
   - Count the unique \( m \) that satisfy the conditions, and compute \( k = \frac{m + 2}{2} \)

### Explanation

1. **Divisor Function (`func_1`):**
   - Computes all divisors of a given number \( x \) efficiently by iterating up to \( \sqrt{x} \).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, compute \( d1 = n - x \) and \( d2 = n - 2 + x \)
   - Find even divisors \( m \geq 2 \) of \( d1 \) and \( d2 \)
   - Ensure \( k = \frac{m + 2}{2} \) satisfies the conditions:
     - For \( d1 \): \( x \leq k \)
     - For \( d2 \): \( k > x \)
   - Use a set to store unique \( k
