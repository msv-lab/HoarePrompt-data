Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have some cards with numbers from 1 to n, and I have a certain number of each. Then, I can buy up to k new cards, choosing any numbers from 1 to n. After buying, I arrange all my cards in a line and need to count the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n]. I need to maximize this count.

First, I need to understand what a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] means in this context. It means that in any sequence of n consecutive cards, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once. So, for example, if n=3, a valid permutation subarray would be [1,2,3] or [3,1,2], but not [1,2,2] because 2 is repeated.

My goal is to arrange all my cards (after buying up to k new ones) in such a way that the number of these valid permutations is maximized.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I have t test cases, and for each test case, I get n, k, and a list of a_i, which are the initial counts of cards for each number.

Constraints:

- t ≤ 100

- n can be up to 2*10^5

- k can be up to 10^12

- a_i can be up to 10^12

And the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5*10^5.

Given the large constraints, especially n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 100, with sum of n over all test cases up to 5*10^5, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me try to understand the problem better.

I need to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1,2,…,n].

Given that I can buy up to k new cards, choosing any numbers, I need to strategically increase the counts of certain numbers to allow for more such subarrays.

First, I need to understand what determines the number of such subarrays in an arrangement.

If I have a sequence where every n consecutive cards form a permutation, that would be ideal.

But that might not be possible, depending on the counts of each number.

I need to think about how to arrange the cards to maximize such subarrays.

One way to think about this is to maximize the number of positions where a window of size n is a permutation.

This is similar to sliding a window of size n across the array and counting how many times the window contains each number from 1 to n exactly once.

To maximize this, I need to ensure that in as many n-sized windows as possible, all numbers from 1 to n are present exactly once.

Now, to achieve this, I need to have sufficient counts of each number.

The bottleneck will be the number with the smallest count because to have a permutation in every window, I need to have enough of each number to cover all windows.

Wait, but that might not be entirely accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array of size m, where m is the total number of cards after buying k new ones.

So, m = sum of a_i + k.

I need to arrange these m cards such that the number of n-sized windows that are permutations of [1,2,…,n] is maximized.

To maximize this, I need to maximize the number of positions i where the subarray from position i to i+n-1 is a permutation.

This is equivalent to having as many overlapping permutations as possible.

One way to maximize this is to create a sequence where the numbers are arranged in a way that allows for the maximum overlap of these permutations.

For example, if n=3, and I have enough of each number, I can create a sequence like [1,2,3,2,3,1,3,2,1,...] where each window of size 3 is a permutation.

But in reality, the counts of each number might be different, so I need to balance the counts.

I need to ensure that for each window of size n, all numbers from 1 to n are present.

To maximize the number of such windows, I need to maximize the number of positions where this condition holds.

Now, to model this, perhaps I can think in terms of sliding a window across the array and ensuring that in each window, all numbers are present.

The number of such windows would be equal to m - n + 1, minus the number of windows that don't satisfy the condition.

But that seems too vague.

Alternatively, I can think about the minimal number of times each number must appear to maximize the number of valid windows.

I recall that in some problems, the minimal possible maximum or something like that is involved.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the smallest count among a_i, and then see how much I can increase it by buying k cards.

Let me consider that.

If I sort the a_i in ascending order, then the smallest a_i is a[0], the next is a[1], and so on up to a[n-1].

To make as many windows as possible be permutations, I need to make the counts of all a_i as balanced as possible.

In other words, I want to minimize the difference between the counts of the numbers.

The limiting factor will be the number with the smallest count because to have a permutation in every window, I need to have at least one of each number in every window.

Wait, but that's for requiring all windows to be permutations, which might not be necessary here. Here, I just want to maximize the number of windows that are permutations, not necessarily have all windows be permutations.

So perhaps a different approach is needed.

Let me consider the total number of possible windows, which is m - n + 1, where m is the total number of cards after buying k new ones.

I need to maximize how many of these windows are permutations of [1,2,…,n].

To maximize this, I need to maximize the number of positions where the window contains each number from 1 to n exactly once.

Now, to maximize this, I need to arrange the cards in such a way that the overlapping permutations are maximized.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can look for a pattern that repeats the permutation as much as possible.

For example, if I have enough of each number, I can arrange the sequence as a repeating permutation, like [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...].

In this case, every window of size n would be a permutation, provided that n divides the period.

But in reality, the counts of each number might be different, so I need to adjust accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this problem using the concept of sliding windows and tracking the frequency of each number in the window.

But that seems too vague and not directly leading to a solution.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have infinite cards of each type. Then, I can arrange the sequence in a way that every window of size n is a permutation.

But I have limited cards, so I need to see how many such windows I can have given the counts.

I need to find the maximum number of non-overlapping or overlapping windows that satisfy the condition.

Wait, but windows can overlap by one position, so it's not just non-overlapping.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at small examples to get some intuition.

Take n=1, k=10, a=[1]. So, I have one card with number 1, and I can buy 10 more cards, each with number 1.

So, total cards: 11 ones.

The only possible subarray of length 1 is [1], and there are 11 of them, all permutations of [1].

So, the answer is 11.

That seems straightforward.

Another example: n=2, k=4, a=[8,4].

So, I have 8 cards of 1 and 4 cards of 2, and I can buy 4 more cards, choosing any numbers.

To maximize the number of windows of size 2 that are permutations of [1,2].

So, a window is a permutation if it's [1,2] or [2,1].

To maximize this, I need to maximize the number of positions where two consecutive cards are different.

Given that I have 8 ones and 4 twos initially, and can buy 4 more cards of any type.

Let me think about the total number of cards after buying: 8 + 4 + 4 = 16 cards.

To maximize the number of windows that are permutations, I need to arrange the cards so that as many consecutive pairs as possible consist of different numbers.

One way to do this is to alternate as much as possible between the two numbers.

For example, arrange them in an alternating pattern: 1,2,1,2,... and so on.

Given that I have 8 ones and 4 twos initially, and can buy 4 more twos, I can have 8 ones and 8 twos.

Then, I can arrange them as: 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2.

In this arrangement, every window of size 2 is a permutation: [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], etc.

So, there are 15 windows (since m=16, m-n+1=15), and all 15 are permutations.

But according to the sample input, the answer is 15, which matches.

Another sample input: n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8].

Total cards after buying: 6 +1 +8 +4 = 19.

I need to arrange these 19 cards to maximize the number of windows of size 3 that are permutations of [1,2,3].

To maximize this, I need to arrange the cards so that as many consecutive sets of 3 are permutations.

Given that I have 6 ones, 1 two, and 8 threes, and can buy 4 more cards of any type.

I can choose to buy, say, 4 twos, making it 6 ones, 5 twos, and 8 threes.

Then, I need to arrange these to maximize the number of valid windows.

One possible arrangement is: 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1.

In this arrangement, each window of size 3 is [1,2,3], which is a permutation.

But I have only 5 twos, so I can only make 5 such complete cycles.

Wait, perhaps I can interleave them differently.

Another arrangement: 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1.

Here, I have 16 positions, but I have only 5 twos, which might not be enough.

Wait, I have 5 twos, 6 ones, and 8 threes.

I can arrange them as: 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1.

This uses 5 twos, 6 ones, and 6 threes.

But I have 8 threes, so I have 2 threes left.

I can place them somewhere, but it might not help in increasing the number of valid windows.

In this arrangement, I have 15 windows of size 3, all being [1,2,3], which are permutations.

But according to the sample, the answer is 15, which matches.

Another sample: n=3, k=9, a=[7,6,2].

Total cards: 7+6+2+9=24.

I can buy 9 more cards, choosing any numbers.

To maximize the number of windows of size 3 that are permutations.

I can choose to buy, say, 5 twos and 4 threes, making counts: 7 ones, 11 twos, 6 threes.

Then, I can arrange them to have as many [1,2,3] or other permutations as possible.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Looking at the sample output, it's 22.

I need to see how to achieve 22.

Total windows: m - n +1 =24 -3 +1=22.

So, it's possible to have all 22 windows being permutations.

But do I have enough cards to do that?

For all 22 windows to be permutations, I need to have a sequence where every 3 consecutive cards are a permutation.

This would require that the sequence is arranged in a way that no three consecutive cards have any duplicates.

Given that, I need to have sufficient counts of each number to sustain this pattern.

In this case, with n=3, to have 22 such windows, I need a sequence of 24 cards where every 3 consecutive cards are a permutation of [1,2,3].

This seems feasible if I have enough of each number.

In this sample, after buying 9 cards, I have a total of 24 cards.

If I choose to buy, say, 9 ones, then I have 16 ones, 6 twos, and 2 threes.

But in this case, it would be hard to arrange them to have all windows be permutations because there are not enough twos and threes.

Wait, in the initial counts, a=[7,6,2], and k=9.

So, total m=7+6+2+9=24.

To achieve 22 valid windows, perhaps by balancing the counts appropriately.

I need a general approach to calculate this.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula.

I recall that in some problems involving arranging items with certain frequencies to maximize overlapping properties, sorting and incremental addition might help.

Looking at the provided code:

- It sorts the a_i in ascending order.

- Then, it initializes ans with a[0].

- It iterates from 0 to n-2, and for each i, it calculates the difference between a[i+1] and a[i].

- If the difference is 0, it decrements res by 1.

- If the difference is not 0, and k is greater than or equal to dif * (i+1), it adds dif to ans, subtracts dif*(i+1) from k, and decrements res by 1.

- If k is less than dif*(i+1), it adds k//(i+1) to ans, adds k%(i+1) to res (if i !=0), and sets k to 0.

- After the loop, if k is still greater than 0, it adds k//n to ans and adds k%n to res.

- Finally, it computes ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res and appends to ans_list.

This seems quite involved. I need to understand what this is doing.

First, sorting a_i in ascending order.

Then, ans starts with a[0], which is the smallest count.

Then, for each i from 0 to n-2, it looks at a[i+1] - a[i].

If a[i+1] == a[i], it decrements res by 1.

Else, if k >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) * (i+1), it adds (a[i+1] - a[i]) to ans and subtracts (a[i+1] - a[i])*(i+1) from k, and decrements res by 1.

Else, it adds k//(i+1) to ans, adds k%(i+1) to res (if i !=0), sets k to 0.

Then, if k is still left, it adds k//n to ans and adds k%n to res.

Finally, ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res is the answer.

I need to understand what ans and res represent.

It seems that ans is built up by incrementally considering the differences between sorted a_i, and res keeps track of some remainder.

But I'm not sure about the exact meaning.

Perhaps ans represents the number of complete blocks of permutations, and res represents some additional positions.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to see with the sample input.

First sample:

n=1, k=10, a=[1]

sorted a: [1]

ans = 1

res = 1 - 1 = 0

loop doesn't run since n-1=0

k=10 >=0, so ans += 10//1 =10, res +=10%1=0

ans =11, res=0

then ans + (ans-1)*(1-1) + res =11 +10*0 +0=11

which matches the sample output of 11.

Second sample:

n=2, k=4, a=[8,4]

sorted a: [4,8]

ans=4

res=2-1=1

i=0:

a[1]-a[0]=4

k=4 >=4*(0+1)=4

ans +=4 -> ans=8

k -=4*1=4 ->k=0

res -=1 ->res=0

then, k=0, so no addition

ans + (ans-1)*(2-1) + res=8 +7*1 +0=15

which matches the sample output of 15.

Third sample:

n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8]

sorted a: [1,6,8]

ans=1

res=3-1=2

i=0:

a[1]-a[0]=5

k=4 >=5*(1)=5? no

so ans +=4//1=4 ->ans=5

res +=4%1=0 (since i!=0)

k=0

then, k=0, so no addition

ans + (ans-1)*(3-1) + res=5 +4*2 +0=13

But according to the sample, the output should be 15.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the third sample input, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8]

sorted a: [1,6,8]

ans=1

res=3-1=2

i=0:

a[1]-a[0]=5

k=4 < 5*1=5, so ans +=4//1=4 ->ans=5

res +=4%1=0 (since i!=0)

k=0

then, k=0, so no addition

ans + (ans-1)*(3-1) + res=5 +4*2 +0=13

But the sample output is 15.

Hmm, seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Looking back at the code:

ans_list.append(ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res)

In the third sample, ans=5, n=3, res=0

So, 5 +4*2 +0=13, but sample output is 15.

Maybe the code is incorrect?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the code, res is initially n-1, which is 2.

Then, i=0:

a[1]-a[0]=5

k=4 < 5*1=5, so ans +=4//1=4 ->ans=5

res +=4%1=0 (since i!=0)

k=0

No more iterations.

Then, ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res=5 +4*2 +0=13

But sample output is 15.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, maybe I misread the condition.

Looking back at the code:

if dif !=0:

if k >= dif*(i+1):

ans += dif

k -= dif*(i+1)

res -=1

else:

ans += k//(i+1)

if i !=0:

res += k%(i+1)

k=0

break

In the third sample, i=0, dif=5, k=4 < 5*1=5, so ans +=4//1=4 ->ans=5

res +=4%1=0 (since i=0, but i !=0 is False, so res remains 2)

Wait, in the code, it's res -=1 if k >= dif*(i+1), and res += k%(i+1) if i !=0

In this case, k < dif*(i+1), so res += k%(i+1) if i !=0

But i=0, so res +=0

Thus, res remains 2

Then, ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res=5 +4*2 +2=15

Which matches the sample output.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, res remains 2, not 0.

Thus, 5 +8 +2=15.

Okay, got it.

So, in this case, res is initially n-1, which is 2.

Then, in the loop, since k < dif*(i+1), and i=0, res += k%(i+1)=0, so res remains 2.

Then, final answer is ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res=5 +8 +2=15.

Okay, that makes sense.

So, perhaps the formula is correct.

I need to understand what ans and res represent.

It seems that ans represents the minimum count after adjustments, and res represents some remainder that can be used to cover additional windows.

But I need to understand the logic behind this formula.

Looking at the formula:

final answer = ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res

This seems similar to a formula for calculating the number of overlapping windows.

Wait, ans represents the number of complete blocks where all counts are at least ans.

Then, (ans-1)*(n-1) might represent the overlapping windows between blocks.

And res might represent additional windows that can be formed with the remaining cards.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps ans represents the number of times the minimal count is achieved, and res represents extra windows that can be formed with the remaining cards.

But I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in order to have a window of size n that is a permutation, I need to have at least one of each number in the window.

So, to maximize the number of such windows, I need to maximize the number of positions where this condition holds.

This is similar to finding the maximum number of sliding windows of size n that satisfy the condition.

In terms of frequency counts, the limiting factor is the number with the smallest count.

But since I can buy up to k additional cards, I can increase the counts of certain numbers to allow for more such windows.

The approach in the code seems to sort the a_i in ascending order and then incrementally increase the minimal count by distributing the k cards appropriately.

By sorting a_i, ans starts with the smallest count, a[0].

Then, for each i from 0 to n-2, it looks at the difference between a[i+1] and a[i].

If k is sufficient to make a[i] equal to a[i+1], it does so by adding the difference to ans and subtracting the cost from k.

If not, it adds as much as possible to ans and adjusts res accordingly.

Finally, it accounts for any remaining k by adding k//n to ans and k%n to res.

Then, the final answer is computed as ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res.

I need to verify if this formula makes sense.

Let me consider that ans represents the minimal count after distributing k cards, and (ans-1)*(n-1) accounts for the overlapping windows, and res accounts for additional windows.

But I need to confirm this.

Looking back at the first sample:

n=1, k=10, a=[1]

sorted a: [1]

ans=1

res=0 (n-1=0)

k=10 >=0, so ans +=10//1=10 -> ans=11, res +=10%1=0

final answer: 11 +10*0 +0=11

Which matches.

Second sample:

n=2, k=4, a=[8,4]

sorted a: [4,8]

ans=4

res=1 (n-1=1)

i=0:

dif=4, k=4 >=4*1=4

ans +=4 -> ans=8

k -=4 ->k=0

res -=1 ->res=0

final answer:8 +7*1 +0=15

Which matches.

Third sample:

n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8]

sorted a: [1,6,8]

ans=1

res=2 (n-1=2)

i=0:

dif=5, k=4 <5*1=5

ans +=4//1=4 ->ans=5

res +=4%1=0 (since i !=0)

k=0

final answer:5 +4*2 +2=15

Which matches.

Another sample:

n=3, k=9, a=[7,6,2]

sorted a: [2,6,7]

ans=2

res=2 (n-1=2)

i=0:

dif=4, k=9 >=4*1=4

ans +=4 ->ans=6

k -=4 ->k=5

res -=1 ->res=1

i=1:

dif=1, k=5 >=1*2=2

ans +=1 ->ans=7

k -=2 ->k=3

res -=1 ->res=0

k=3 >=0, so ans +=3//3=1 ->ans=8

res +=3%3=0

final answer:8 +7*2 +0=22

Which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that this approach is correct, at least for the sample inputs.

I need to make sure that this logic is general and works for all cases.

Let me try to understand the logic step by step.

1. Sort a_i in ascending order.

2. Initialize ans with a[0], the smallest count.

3. Initialize res with n-1.

4. Iterate from i=0 to n-2:

a. Calculate dif = a[i+1] - a[i]

b. If k >= dif * (i+1):

i. Add dif to ans

ii. Subtract dif*(i+1) from k

iii. Decrement res by 1

c. Else:

i. Add k//(i+1) to ans

ii. If i !=0, add k%(i+1) to res

iii. Set k=0

break

5. If k >0 after the loop:

a. Add k//n to ans

b. Add k%n to res

6. Compute final answer as ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res

I need to understand why this works.

It seems that ans represents the minimal count that can be achieved for all a_i after distributing k cards.

By sorting a_i, we ensure that a[0] is the minimal initial count.

Then, for each i, we try to make a[i] equal to a[i+1] by adding dif to ans, which effectively means that we are increasing the minimal count to a[i+1].

The cost of making this increase is dif*(i+1), because we need to add dif to the first i+1 elements to make them equal to a[i+1].

If k is sufficient, we do so; otherwise, we add as much as possible to ans and adjust res accordingly.

Finally, we account for any remaining k by adding k//n to ans and k%n to res.

Then, the formula ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res seems to calculate the total number of valid windows.

I need to verify this formula.

Let me consider that ans represents the number of complete blocks where all a_i are at least ans.

Then, (ans-1)*(n-1) might represent the overlapping windows between blocks.

And res represents additional windows that can be formed with the remaining cards.

But I need to confirm this.

Alternatively, perhaps ans represents the number of times the minimal count is achieved, and the formula calculates the total number of valid windows based on that.

Given that, ans + (ans-1)*(n-1) + res seems similar to a formula for calculating the number of overlapping subarrays.

In general, for a sequence of length m, the number of subarrays of length n is m - n +1.

But in this problem, we need to maximize the number of such subarrays that are permutations.

Given that, perhaps ans represents some base count, and the formula adjusts for overlaps and remainders.

Given that the code seems to work for the sample inputs, and I can't find any obvious flaws in the logic, I'll conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}\]
