Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and there are multiple queries. Each query gives me a range within this array, and I need to find two indices within that range such that the elements at those indices are different. If such a pair doesn't exist, I should return -1 and -1.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have an array a of length n, and q queries. For each query, I get l and r, which define a subarray from index l to r (inclusive). I need to find two indices i and j within this range where a[i] != a[j]. If no such pair exists, I return -1 and -1.

I should consider the constraints. The array can be up to 2*10^5 elements, and there can be up to 2*10^5 queries. So, efficiency is important here. I need an approach that can handle large inputs within reasonable time limits.

Let me think about how to approach this. For each query, if all elements in the subarray from l to r are the same, then there is no such pair. Otherwise, there is at least one pair with different elements.

One way is to check for each query if all elements in the subarray are identical. If they are, return -1 and -1; otherwise, return any two indices with different elements.

But checking for each query whether all elements are the same would be inefficient if done naively, especially with large n and q.

I need a smarter way. Maybe I can preprocess the array to find intervals where all elements are the same or where a change occurs.

Let me consider storing the positions where the element changes in the array. That is, where a[i] != a[i-1]. If I have these positions, for any query, I can check if there is at least one change within the range l to r.

Yes, that sounds promising. I can precompute the positions where the element changes and then, for each query, check if there is at least one such change within the range.

To implement this, I can iterate through the array and record the indices where a[i] != a[i-1]. Then, for each query, I can check if there is any such index between l and r.

If there is at least one change within the range, that means there are at least two different elements in that range. If there are no changes, all elements are the same.

This should be efficient because preprocessing can be done in O(n), and each query can be answered in O(1) time using precomputed data.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, I'll iterate through the array from index 1 to n-1, and record the indices where a[i] != a[i-1].

Then, for each query, I need to check if there is any such index in the range [l, r-1].

Wait, since the change happens at index i where a[i] != a[i-1], and I need to check if any such i exists between l and r-1.

But to make it simpler, maybe I can use a boolean array to mark positions where a change occurs, and then use a prefix sum to quickly check if there is at least one change in the range.

Actually, since q can be up to 2*10^5, using binary search for each query might not be efficient enough. So, prefix sums would be better.

Let me define a prefix sum array where prefix[i] is the number of changes up to index i.

Then, for a query [l, r], if prefix[r-1] - prefix[l-1] >= 1, then there is at least one change in the range, meaning there are different elements.

Otherwise, all elements are the same.

This should work efficiently.

Now, for the cases where there are different elements, I need to output any two indices with different elements.

To make it efficient, I can precompute for each position the next position where a different element occurs.

But maybe there's a simpler way.

Given that I have identified that there is at least one pair with different elements in the range, I can just pick the first two indices where the elements differ.

Alternatively, since the problem allows any such pair, I can choose the smallest two indices where the elements differ.

To optimize, perhaps for each query, after determining that there is at least one pair, I can find the smallest i and j where a[i] != a[j].

But to make it even simpler, since the problem doesn't require the lexicographically smallest pair or anything like that, I can just pick any pair with different elements.

For example, in the range [l, r], find the smallest i where a[i] != a[l], and if such an i exists, output l and i.

If no such i exists, then all elements are the same, and I output -1 and -1.

Wait, but I need to make sure that i > l.

Actually, since l <= i <= r, and l <= j <= r, and i != j, with a[i] != a[j].

So, for each query, I can iterate from l to r, and look for the first index i where a[i] != a[l].

If such an i exists, then output l and i.

If no such i exists, output -1 and -1.

This seems straightforward.

But considering the constraints, iterating through each query range could be too slow if done naively.

Wait, but since q can be up to 2*10^5, and n up to 2*10^5, a O(q * n) solution would be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me think differently.

If I precompute for each position the next position where a different element occurs, then for each query, I can use this precomputed data to quickly find such a pair.

Yes, that could work.

So, I can create an array next_diff where next_diff[i] is the smallest index j > i where a[j] != a[i], or -1 if no such j exists.

Then, for each query [l, r], I can check if next_diff[l] <= r.

If yes, then output l and next_diff[l].

If not, then output -1 and -1.

This seems efficient, as preprocessing next_diff can be done in O(n), and answering each query is O(1).

Let me think about how to implement next_diff.

I can iterate from the end of the array to the beginning, and for each position i, find the smallest j > i where a[j] != a[i].

I can do this by maintaining a stack or using some pointer to track the next different element.

Actually, a simple way is to iterate from right to left, and keep track of the last position where a[j] != a[i].

Wait, maybe it's better to iterate from left to right.

Let me try.

Initialize next_diff[n-1] = -1, since there is no j > n-1.

Set current = n-1.

For i from n-2 downto 0:

if a[i] != a[current]:

next_diff[i] = current

else:

next_diff[i] = next_diff[current]

if next_diff[current] == -1:

next_diff[i] = -1

else:

current = next_diff[current]

Wait, this seems like a way to find the next different element efficiently.

Wait, actually, it's similar to building a sparse table for nearest different element.

But maybe there is a simpler way.

Alternatively, I can iterate from the end, and keep track of the last position where a[j] != a[i].

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize next_diff = [-1] * n

right = n - 1

for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):

if a[i] != a[right]:

next_diff[i] = right

else:

next_diff[i] = next_diff[right]

if next_diff[right] != -1:

right = next_diff[right]

else:

next_diff[i] = -1

This seems correct.

Then, for each query [l, r], if next_diff[l-1] <= r, output l and next_diff[l-1]+1.

Else, output -1 and -1.

Wait, indices are 1-based, so need to adjust for 0-based indexing.

Actually, it's better to use 1-based indexing for consistency with the problem.

Let me adjust the implementation accordingly.

Set next_diff[0] = -1 if a[0] == a[1], else 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate from the end.

Initialize next_diff[n] = n

for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):

if a[i] != a[i+1]:

next_diff[i] = i+1

else:

next_diff[i] = next_diff[i+1]

This should work.

Then, for each query [l, r], if next_diff[l] <= r, output l and next_diff[l].

Else, output -1 and -1.

This seems efficient and correct.

Let me verify this with an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 5

a = [1,1,2,1,1]

q = 3

Queries:

1 5

1 2

1 3

Compute next_diff:

Initialize next_diff[5] = 5 (sentinel)

For i=4: a[4]=1, a[5]=sentinel (consider as different), so next_diff[4]=5

For i=3: a[3]=1, a[4]=1, same, so next_diff[3]=next_diff[4]=5

For i=2: a[2]=2, a[3]=1, different, so next_diff[2]=3

For i=1: a[1]=1, a[2]=2, different, so next_diff[1]=2

For i=0: a[0]=1, a[1]=1, same, so next_diff[0]=next_diff[1]=2

So next_diff = [2,2,3,5,5]

Now, for query 1 5:

next_diff[1-1=0] = 2, which is <=5, so output 1 and 2

For query 1 2:

next_diff[1-1=0]=2, but 2 > 2, which is r=2, so no pair, output -1 -1

Wait, but in the array, a[1]=1 and a[2]=1 are the same, so no pair.

Wait, but according to next_diff[0]=2, which is beyond r=2, so correctly output -1 -1

For query 1 3:

next_diff[1-1=0]=2, which is <=3, so output 1 and 2

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=6

a=[30,20,20,10,10,20]

q=5

Queries:

1 2

2 3

2 4

2 6

3 5

Compute next_diff:

Initialize next_diff[6]=6

i=5: a[5]=20, a[6]=sentinel, different, next_diff[5]=6

i=4: a[4]=10, a[5]=20, different, next_diff[4]=5

i=3: a[3]=10, a[4]=10, same, next_diff[3]=next_diff[4]=5

i=2: a[2]=20, a[3]=10, different, next_diff[2]=3

i=1: a[1]=20, a[2]=20, same, next_diff[1]=next_diff[2]=3

i=0: a[0]=30, a[1]=20, different, next_diff[0]=1

So next_diff = [1,3,3,5,5,6]

For query 1 2:

next_diff[1-1=0]=1, which is <=2, so output 1 and 1+1=2

But a[1]=30 and a[2]=20 are different, so correct.

Query 2 3:

next_diff[2-1=1]=3, which is <=3, so output 2 and 3

a[2]=20 and a[3]=20 are same, but according to next_diff, it points to 3, but a[3]=20 is same as a[2]=20.

Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps my implementation is incorrect.

Wait, no, in this case, a[2]=20 and a[3]=20 are the same, so next_diff[1]=3, but a[3]=20 is same as a[2]=20, so this is incorrect.

Wait, I see the issue.

My initial approach is flawed because next_diff[i] points to the next index where a different element occurs, but if a[next_diff[i]] == a[i], then it's not a valid pair.

So, in this case, for query [2,3], next_diff[1]=3, but a[2]=20 and a[3]=20 are the same, so I need to find the next different index beyond 3, but in this range, there is no such index.

So, my approach needs adjustment.

I need to ensure that next_diff[i] points to an index j where a[j] != a[i], and j <= r.

So, in this case, for query [2,3], next_diff[1]=3, but a[3]=20 == a[2]=20, so I need to check further.

Wait, but according to my initial approach, next_diff[i] should directly point to an index with a different element.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the way I build next_diff.

Let me think again.

I need next_diff[i] to be the smallest j > i where a[j] != a[i], or -1 if no such j exists.

In the second test case, for i=1 (a[1]=20), next_diff[1]=3, but a[3]=20 == a[1]=20, which is incorrect because next_diff should point to an index with a different element.

Wait, no, according to the way I built it, next_diff[1]=3 because a[2]=20 == a[1]=20, so next_diff[1]=next_diff[2]=3, and a[3]=10 != a[1]=20, so next_diff[1]=3 is correct.

Wait, but in the query [2,3], l=2, r=3.

next_diff[2-1=1]=3, which is within [2,3], and a[2]=20 != a[3]=20, so it's correct.

Wait, a[2]=20 and a[3]=20 are the same, but according to next_diff[1]=3, a[3]=10 != a[1]=20, but in the query [2,3], a[2]=20 and a[3]=20 are the same, so there is no pair with different elements in [2,3].

So, my approach is flawed because next_diff[1]=3 points to a[3]=10, which is outside the query range [2,3].

Wait, no, a[3]=10 is within [2,3], but a[3]=10 != a[2]=20, so it should be a valid pair.

Wait, but in the array, a[2]=20 and a[3]=10 are different, so it's a valid pair.

Wait, but in the initial thought, I thought a[2]=20 and a[3]=20, but in reality, in the second test case, a=[30,20,20,10,10,20], so a[2]=20 and a[3]=10 are different.

Wait, perhaps I misread the array.

Wait, indices are 1-based, so a[1]=30, a[2]=20, a[3]=20, a[4]=10, a[5]=10, a[6]=20.

So, in query [2,3], a[2]=20 and a[3]=20 are the same, so no pair with different elements.

But according to next_diff[1]=3, a[3]=10 != a[2]=20, but a[3] is within the query range [2,3], so it's a valid pair.

Wait, but a[2]=20 and a[3]=10 are different, so output 2 and 3.

Wait, in the initial thought, I thought a[3]=20, but actually a[3]=20 in the first test case, but in this second test case, a[3]=10.

Wait, I need to be careful with indices and test cases.

Let me double-check the second test case:

n=6

a=[30,20,20,10,10,20]

So, a[1]=30, a[2]=20, a[3]=20, a[4]=10, a[5]=10, a[6]=20

Queries:

1 2 -> a[1]=30, a[2]=20 -> different, output 1 and 2

2 3 -> a[2]=20, a[3]=20 -> same, no pair -> -1 -1

2 4 -> a[2]=20, a[3]=20, a[4]=10 -> pair exists, e.g., 2 and 4

2 6 -> a[2]=20, a[3]=20, a[4]=10, a[5]=10, a[6]=20 -> pair exists, e.g., 2 and 4

3 5 -> a[3]=20, a[4]=10, a[5]=10 -> pair exists, e.g., 3 and 4

So, in query [2,3], a[2]=20 and a[3]=20 are the same, so no pair with different elements.

But according to next_diff[1]=3, a[3]=10 != a[2]=20, and 3 is within [2,3], so it's a valid pair.

Wait, but a[2]=20 and a[3]=10 are different, so it's a valid pair.

So, in this case, output should be 2 and 3.

Wait, but in my initial approach, if next_diff[l-1] <= r, output l and next_diff[l-1]

For query [2,3], l=2, next_diff[1]=3 <=3, so output 2 and 3, which is correct because a[2] != a[3].

Wait, but in the thought process earlier, I thought a[2]=20 and a[3]=20 are the same, but in this test case, a[3]=10, which is different.

So, my approach seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I confused the array values in my head.

Let me consider another test case to verify.

Take the third test case:

n=4

a=[5,2,3,4]

q=4

Queries:

1 2

1 4

2 3

2 4

Compute next_diff:

Initialize next_diff[4]=4

i=3: a[3]=4 != a[4]=4, same, next_diff[3]=4

i=2: a[2]=3 != a[3]=4, different, next_diff[2]=3

i=1: a[1]=2 != a[2]=3, different, next_diff[1]=2

i=0: a[0]=5 != a[1]=2, different, next_diff[0]=1

So next_diff = [1,2,3,4]

For query [1,2]:

next_diff[1-1=0]=1 <=2, so output 1 and 1

Wait, but indices start at 1, so output 1 and 2, which are different.

For query [1,4]:

next_diff[1-1=0]=1 <=4, so output 1 and 1+1=2

a[1]=5 != a[2]=2, correct.

For query [2,3]:

next_diff[2-1=1]=2 <=3, so output 2 and 2+1=3

a[2]=3 != a[3]=4, correct.

For query [2,4]:

next_diff[2-1=1]=2 <=4, so output 2 and 3

a[2]=3 != a[3]=4, correct.

Seems fine.

Wait, but in the second test case, for query [2,3], next_diff[1]=3 <=3, so output 2 and 3, which are different in this case.

But earlier I thought a[2]=20 and a[3]=20 are same, but in the second test case, a[3]=10, which is different.

So, my approach seems correct.

Perhaps I need to adjust my understanding of the next_diff array.

So, to summarize, I'll preprocess the next_diff array such that next_diff[i] is the smallest j > i where a[j] != a[i], or -1 if no such j exists.

Then, for each query [l, r], if next_diff[l-1] <= r, output l and next_diff[l-1]

Else, output -1 and -1.

This should work efficiently within O(n + q) time, which is acceptable given the constraints.

Now, I need to implement this logic correctly.

Also, I need to handle 1-based vs 0-based indexing carefully.

In code, arrays are 0-based, so I need to adjust indices accordingly.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the array a of n integers.

- Convert a to 0-based indexing.

- Precompute next_diff:

- Initialize next_diff[n] = -1

- For i from n-2 downto 0:

- If a[i] != a[i+1], next_diff[i] = i+1

- Else, next_diff[i] = next_diff[i+1]

- Read q.

- For each query:

- Read l, r (1-based)

- Convert to 0-based: l -=1

- If next_diff[l] != -1 and next_diff[l] <= r, output l+1 and next_diff[l]+1

- Else, output -1 and -1

I need to ensure that next_diff is correctly computed and that indices are properly adjusted.

Also, I need to handle the case when l = r, but according to the problem, l <= r, and l >=1, r >=l.

But in the problem statement, it's specified that l <= i <= r and l <= j <= r, and i != j, with a_i != a_j.

So, if l = r, then i and j must be the same, but i != j, so no pair exists.

Wait, l <= i <= r and l <= j <= r, i != j, a_i != a_j.

So, if l = r, then there's only one element, so no such pair exists.

Hence, for l = r, always output -1 -1.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's given that 1 <= l <= r <= n, but in the explanation, l <= i <= r and l <= j <= r, i != j, a_i != a_j.

So, if l = r, then i and j must be different indices, but they are the same, so no pair exists.

Hence, in such cases, output -1 -1.

But in my approach, if l = r, next_diff[l-1] would point to some j > l-1, which is j >= l.

But since l = r, j > l-1 implies j >= l, but j != i, so j > l-1 and j != i.

But in this case, j > l-1 implies j >= l, but j != l, so j > l.

But if l = r, then j > l is j >= l+1, which is beyond r.

Hence, next_diff[l-1] > r, so output -1 -1, which is correct.

So, the approach handles l = r correctly.

Good.

Now, I need to implement this logic carefully, paying attention to 1-based vs 0-based indexing.

Also, ensure that the next_diff array is correctly built.

Let me consider edge cases:

- All elements are the same: next_diff[i] = -1 for all i.

- All elements are different: next_diff[i] = i+1 for all i < n.

- Mixed elements.

- Single element queries: l = r, should output -1 -1.

- Queries where l = r -1 and a[l] != a[r]: output l and r.

- Queries where l = r -1 and a[l] == a[r]: output -1 -1.

I need to make sure that the code handles these cases correctly.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases correctly, ensuring that variables are reset for each test case.

Now, I need to look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Wait, the problem mentions t <=1e4, but n and q are up to 2e5 per test case, but sum of n and sum of q across all test cases are up to 2e5.

Wait, no, it says sum of n across all test cases <=2e5, and sum of q across all test cases <=2e5.

So, t <=1e4, but sum of n <=2e5, and sum of q <=2e5.

Hence, n and q per test case can be up to 2e5, but across all test cases, sum of n and sum of q are <=2e5.

Hence, total time should be O(sum of n + sum of q) = O(2e5 + 2e5) = O(4e5), which is acceptable.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

R = lambda : map(int, input().split())

(t,) = R()

while t:

t -= 1

(*_, k) = R()

a = {*R()}

b = {*R()}

f = 1

m = n = k // 2

for i in range(1, k + 1):

u = i in a

v = i in b

f &= u | v

m -= u & ~v

n -= ~u & v

print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])

This seems completely unrelated to the problem at hand.

Wait, this looks like a different problem, possibly involving sets and some conditions on their elements.

This doesn't seem to relate to the array and query problem we have.

Hence, the given program is incorrect for this problem.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
