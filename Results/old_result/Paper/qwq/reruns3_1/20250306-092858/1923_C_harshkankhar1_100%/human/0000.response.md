Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this concept of a "good" array, which is defined based on certain conditions involving another array B. The problem gives me an array C of length N, and I need to answer Q queries about whether a subarray of C from index L to R is "good" according to the definition.

First, I need to understand what makes an array A "good." According to the problem, A is good if there exists another array B of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in A is equal to the sum of elements in B.

2. For every index i, A[i] is not equal to B[i].

3. All elements in B are positive integers (greater than 0).

So, for a given subarray of C from L to R, I need to check if it's possible to construct such a B that satisfies these three conditions.

Let me try to rephrase this in simpler terms. I have a subarray, and I need to see if I can create another array B where:

- The total sum is the same as the subarray.

- None of the elements in B are equal to the corresponding elements in the subarray.

- All elements in B are positive integers.

I need to find out for each query (defined by L and R) whether such a B exists.

Alright, so how can I approach this?

Let's consider the sum condition first. The sum of A is equal to the sum of B. So, whatever changes I make to the elements of A to get B, the total sum should remain the same.

But there's also the condition that A[i] != B[i] for every i, and B[i] > 0 for every i.

Hmm, so for each element in A, I need to choose a B[i] that's different from A[i] and positive, and the sum should remain the same.

Wait a minute, if I have to change every A[i] to some B[i] != A[i], and ensure that the sum doesn't change, it seems like for each A[i], I need to choose B[i] such that B[i] = A[i] + delta_i, where delta_i is some integer, but with the constraints that B[i] != A[i] and B[i] > 0.

Moreover, the sum of all delta_i should be zero, because the total sum should remain the same.

But also, for each i, B[i] != A[i], which means delta_i != 0.

And B[i] > 0, so A[i] + delta_i > 0.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a simpler way to look at this.

Let me consider small examples to get some intuition.

Suppose N=1, Q=1, and C=[1], and query is L=1, R=1.

So, subarray is [1].

I need to find B such that B[1] != 1, B[1] > 0, and B[1] = 1.

Wait, but B[1] cannot be equal to A[1], which is 1, and it has to be positive and sum up to 1.

But if B[1] != 1, then sum(B) != sum(A), because sum(B) = B[1] != 1.

So, it's impossible. Hence, "NO".

Another example: N=2, Q=1, C=[1,2], query L=1, R=2.

So, subarray is [1,2].

I need to find B=[b1,b2], where b1 !=1, b2 !=2, b1>0, b2>0, and b1 + b2 = 3.

Is this possible?

Let's see:

If b1=2, b2=1. This satisfies b1 !=1, b2 !=2, and sum is 3.

So, "YES".

Another example: N=3, Q=1, C=[1,1,1], query L=1, R=3.

Subarray is [1,1,1].

I need B=[b1,b2,b3], where each b_i !=1, b_i >0, and b1+b2+b3=3.

Is this possible?

If I set b1=2, b2=1, b3=0, but b3=0 is not allowed since B[i] >0.

Alternatively, b1=2, b2=1, b3=0 is invalid.

Or b1=2, b2=2, b3=-1, but -1 is invalid.

Wait, seems tricky.

Wait, if I set b1=2, b2=1, b3=0, but b3=0 is invalid.

Alternatively, b1=2, b2=2, b3=-1, but -1 is invalid.

Hmm, maybe it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps in this case, "NO".

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, for N=5, Q=4, with C=[1,2,1,4,5], the queries are:

1. L=1, R=5: YES

2. L=4, R=4: NO

3. L=3, R=4: YES

4. L=1, R=3: NO

Looking back at my earlier thoughts, it seems like there's a pattern here, but I need to generalize it.

Maybe I can think about the minimum possible sum of B.

Since B[i] >0 and B[i] != A[i], for each A[i], what's the smallest B[i] I can choose?

If A[i]=1, then B[i] can be 2 or 0, but 0 is invalid, so B[i]=2.

If A[i]=2, then B[i] can be 1 or 3 or more, as long as it's positive and not 2.

So, the minimal B[i] is 1 if A[i] !=1, else 2.

Wait, if A[i]=1, B[i] cannot be 1 (since 1 !=1 is false), wait, but 1 !=1 is false, so B[i] cannot be equal to A[i], which is 1.

So, B[i] must be at least 2.

If A[i]=2, B[i] can be 1 or 3 or more, as long as it's positive and not 2.

So, minimal B[i] is 1.

If A[i]=3, B[i] can be 1,2,4, etc., minimal is 1.

Wait, but B[i] must be positive and not equal to A[i].

So, for any A[i]>1, the minimal B[i] is 1.

For A[i]=1, minimal B[i] is 2.

So, the minimal sum of B is sum over i of minimal B[i].

If the sum of A is equal to this minimal sum, and there exists a way to assign B[i] such that all B[i] are minimal and B[i] !=A[i], then it's possible.

But, in practice, since B[i] must be different from A[i], and minimal B[i] is 1 for A[i]>1 and 2 for A[i]=1, we can calculate the sum of these minimal B[i] and see if it's less than or equal to the sum of A[i].

Wait, but according to the problem, the sum of B must be equal to the sum of A.

So, if the sum of minimal B[i] is greater than the sum of A[i], it's impossible.

Wait, no.

Wait, the minimal sum of B[i] is the sum where each B[i] is as small as possible, given the constraints.

If even this minimal sum is greater than the sum of A[i], it's impossible because you can't make B[i] smaller than their minimal values.

Similarly, if the minimal sum is less than or equal to the sum of A[i], maybe it's possible.

But, in the earlier example, for N=3, C=[1,1,1], query L=1,R=3.

Minimal B[i] for each A[i]=1 is 2.

So, minimal sum of B is 2+2+2=6, while sum of A is 1+1+1=3.

Here, minimal sum of B (6) is greater than sum of A (3), so it's impossible to find such a B where sum of B equals sum of A.

Hence, "NO".

In the earlier example where N=2, C=[1,2], query L=1,R=2.

Minimal B[i] for A[1]=1 is 2, for A[2]=2 is 1.

So, sum of minimal B is 2+1=3, which equals sum of A (1+2=3).

And, in this case, it's possible to set B=[2,1], which satisfies all conditions.

Hence, "YES".

Another example: N=1, C=[1], query L=1,R=1.

Minimal B[i] for A[1]=1 is 2, which is greater than A[1]=1.

Sum of minimal B is 2, sum of A is 1.

Since 2 > 1, it's impossible.

Hence, "NO".

Seems like a pattern here.

So, generalizing, for a subarray from L to R:

- Calculate sum_A = sum of C[L..R]

- Calculate sum_B_min = sum of minimal B[i] for each C[i] in C[L..R], where minimal B[i] is 1 if C[i] >1, else 2.

- If sum_B_min > sum_A, then "NO", else "YES".

Wait, but in the earlier example, for N=3, C=[1,1,1], query L=1,R=3:

sum_A = 3, sum_B_min = 6, which is greater, hence "NO".

For N=2, C=[1,2], query L=1,R=2:

sum_A = 3, sum_B_min = 2+1=3, which is equal, hence "YES".

For N=1, C=[1], query L=1,R=1:

sum_A =1, sum_B_min=2, which is greater, hence "NO".

Seems consistent.

But wait, is this always true?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose N=3, C=[1,2,3], query L=1,R=3.

sum_A =1+2+3=6

sum_B_min =2 +1 +1=4

Which is less than 6.

Hence, "YES".

But can I construct such a B?

Let's see: B=[2,1,3]. Sum is 6, B[i] !=A[i] for all i.

Wait, B[3]=3 == A[3]=3, which violates the condition.

Oops, B[i] must be different from A[i].

So, B=[2,1,4], sum is 7, which is greater than 6.

Not good.

Alternatively, B=[2,1,3], but B[3]=3 ==A[3]=3.

Another try: B=[2,1,3], no good.

B=[2,1,4], sum=7 !=6.

B=[2,1,3], sum=6, but B[3]=3 ==A[3]=3.

Hmm, problematic.

Is there a way to make B[i] !=A[i] for all i and sum to 6?

Let's see:

A=[1,2,3]

Possible B:

B=[2,1,3], sum=6, but B[3]=3 ==A[3]=3.

Not good.

B=[2,1,4], sum=7.

B=[2,3,1], sum=6, and B[i] !=A[i] for all i.

Perfect.

So, "YES".

Hence, in this case, sum_B_min=4 < sum_A=6, and it's possible.

Another example: N=1, C=[2], query L=1,R=1.

sum_A=2, sum_B_min=1, which is less than 2.

Hence, "YES".

Possible B=[1], sum=1 !=2. Wait, no.

Wait, sum must be equal to sum_A.

So, B[i] must be different from A[i] and positive, and sum must be equal to sum_A.

In this case, B=[1], sum=1 !=2.

So, is there any B where B[1] !=2, B[1]>0, and sum=B[1]=2?

Well, B[1]=2 is not allowed since B[1] !=A[1]=2.

So, no such B exists.

Hence, "NO".

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, sum_B_min=1 < sum_A=2, so "YES".

But in reality, it's impossible.

Hence, the condition is not sufficient.

Seems like there's a flaw in this approach.

Wait, in this case, sum_B_min=1 < sum_A=2, but it's impossible to find such a B.

Hence, the condition is not sufficient.

So, perhaps there's more to it.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray from L to R.

I need to assign B[i] for each i in [L,R] such that:

- B[i] != A[i]

- B[i] >0

- Sum of B[i] = sum of A[i]

Let me consider the difference between B[i] and A[i], which is delta_i = B[i] - A[i].

Then, sum of delta_i over all i must be zero.

Also, delta_i !=0 for all i, and B[i] >0, which implies B[i] >=1.

Given that, delta_i = B[i] - A[i] >=1 - A[i].

But since B[i] can be any positive integer except A[i], there's no upper limit on B[i], so delta_i can be any integer except 0.

But the sum of delta_i must be zero.

So, I need to assign delta_i !=0 for all i, and sum of delta_i =0.

This seems similar to assigning non-zero integers to each position such that their sum is zero.

But there are constraints based on A[i].

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal and maximal possible B[i].

But it's getting complicated.

Let me look back at the provided program and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

For each test case:

Read n and q.

Read array a of length n (with 1-based indexing).

Then, compute array b, where b[i] is b[i-1] plus x, where x is 1 if a[i]>1 else 2.

Then, a is accumulated (prefix sums).

For each query:

Read l and r.

If a[r] - a[l-1] < b[r] - b[l-1], or l==r, print "NO", else "YES".

So, it's computing some prefix sums and checking if sum of a from l to r is greater than or equal to sum of b from l to r, unless l==r.

I need to understand what b represents here.

From the code, b[i] is b[i-1] plus x, where x is 1 if a[i]>1 else 2.

So, b[i] is accumulated sum where for each a[i], if a[i]>1, add 1 to the previous b, else add 2.

This seems similar to the minimal sum of B[i].

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, for each a[i], minimal B[i] is 1 if a[i]>1 else 2.

So, sum of minimal B[i] from l to r would be b[r] - b[l-1].

And sum of A from l to r is a[r] - a[l-1].

Then, the condition in the code is:

if sum_A < sum_B_min or l==r, then "NO", else "YES".

This aligns with my earlier thought that if the sum of minimal B[i] is greater than sum of A[i], it's impossible.

Additionally, if l==r, it's directly "NO", which makes sense because for a single element, it's impossible to have B[i] != A[i] and B[i] >0 and sum(B) = sum(A).

Wait, but in the earlier example, N=1, C=[1], query L=1,R=1, sum_A=1, sum_B_min=2, which is greater, hence "NO".

But the code also has a condition for l==r, directly "NO".

So, it seems consistent.

But in another example, N=2, C=[1,2], query L=1,R=2, sum_A=3, sum_B_min=2+1=3, which is equal, hence "YES".

And in the code, if sum_A >= sum_B_min and l != r, then "YES".

Seems correct.

But wait, in my earlier counterexample, N=1, C=[2], query L=1,R=1, sum_A=2, sum_B_min=1, which is less than sum_A, but it's impossible because B[1]=1 !=2, but sum is 1 !=2.

Hence, "NO".

But according to the code, since sum_A >= sum_B_min and l != r, it would be "YES", which is incorrect.

Wait, but in this case, l==r, so it would print "NO".

Wait, no, in this case, l==r, so it would print "NO".

But in my earlier thought, if l != r and sum_A >= sum_B_min, it's "YES".

But in this case, l==r, so it's "NO".

Hence, the code seems correct.

Wait, but in my counterexample, N=1, C=[2], query L=1,R=1, sum_A=2, sum_B_min=1, which is less than sum_A, but it's impossible because B[1]=1 !=2, but sum is 1 !=2.

Hence, "NO".

But according to the code, since l==r, it prints "NO", which is correct.

So, perhaps the condition is correct.

Wait, but in another case, N=2, C=[1,2], query L=1,R=2, sum_A=3, sum_B_min=2+1=3, which is equal, and l !=r, so "YES".

Which is correct.

Another case, N=3, C=[1,1,1], query L=1,R=3, sum_A=3, sum_B_min=2+2+2=6, which is greater, so "NO".

Correct.

Another case, N=3, C=[1,2,3], query L=1,R=3, sum_A=6, sum_B_min=2+1+1=4, which is less than 6, and l !=r, so "YES".

Which is correct, as we saw earlier that it's possible.

Hence, perhaps the condition is sufficient.

But in my earlier thought, for N=2, C=[1,2], sum_A=3, sum_B_min=3, which is equal, and it's possible.

In N=3, C=[1,2,3], sum_A=6, sum_B_min=4, which is less, and it's possible.

So, perhaps as long as sum_A >= sum_B_min and the subarray length is greater than 1, it's possible.

But in the case where sum_A > sum_B_min, is it always possible?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose N=2, C=[2,2], query L=1,R=2, sum_A=4, sum_B_min=1+1=2.

Is it possible to find B=[b1,b2], where b1 !=2, b2 !=2, b1>0, b2>0, and b1 + b2 =4.

Possible options:

B=[1,3], which satisfies b1 !=2, b2 !=2, sum=4.

Hence, "YES".

Another example: N=2, C=[1,3], sum_A=4, sum_B_min=2+1=3.

Possible B=[2,2], sum=4, but B[2]=2 ==A[2]=3? Wait, no, B[2]=2 !=3.

Hence, "YES".

Wait, but B[2]=2 !=3, which is correct.

So, seems possible.

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

But what if N=3, C=[1,1,4], sum_A=6, sum_B_min=2+2+1=5.

Is it possible to find B such that B[i] !=A[i], B[i]>0, and sum=6.

Possible B=[2,2,2], sum=6, B[i] !=A[i] for all i.

Hence, "YES".

Another example: N=3, C=[1,2,3], sum_A=6, sum_B_min=2+1+1=4.

Possible B=[2,1,3], but B[3]=3 ==A[3]=3, which is invalid.

Another try: B=[2,1,3], no good.

B=[2,3,1], sum=6, and B[i] !=A[i] for all i.

Perfect.

Hence, "YES".

So, it seems that as long as sum_A >= sum_B_min and the subarray length is greater than 1, it's possible.

Hence, the condition in the code seems correct.

Additionally, for single-element subarrays (l==r), it's impossible, which aligns with the code.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Correct}}
