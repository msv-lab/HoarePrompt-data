Alright, I have this problem to solve. It involves a game between Alice and Bob on an array of integers, and I need to determine the final score of the game based on their optimal plays. The score is defined as the MEX of the array that Alice constructs.

First, let's understand what MEX is. MEX stands for Minimum EXcludant, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example, the MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2 because 0, 1 are present, but 2 is missing.

Now, the game is played in turns, with Alice starting first. On Alice's turn, she picks an element from the array 'a', appends it to her array 'c', and deletes it from 'a'. Bob, on his turn, picks an element from 'a', and deletes it from 'a'. The game ends when 'a' is empty, and the score is the MEX of 'c'.

Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it. Both play optimally, meaning they make the best possible moves to achieve their goals.

Given that, I need to find out what the final score will be for each test case.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting to solve this problem. Let's analyze it step by step.

The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array.

Then, for each test case, it reads the input, counts the frequency of each element, and iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1 to find the MEX.

But wait, that doesn't seem entirely correct. The MEX is determined by the final array 'c' that Alice constructs, not directly from the original array 'a'.

So, I need to think about how Alice and Bob's actions affect the composition of 'c'.

Let's consider the game mechanics:

- Alice picks an element from 'a', appends it to 'c', and deletes it from 'a'.

- Bob picks an element from 'a' and deletes it from 'a'.

- They alternate turns until 'a' is empty.

- Alice goes first.

- The score is the MEX of 'c'.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX of 'c', which means she wants 'c' to contain as many small non-negative integers as possible, in order to make the smallest missing integer as large as possible.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX of 'c', meaning he wants to prevent Alice from including certain small integers in 'c'.

Given that, Alice will try to include the smallest possible integers in 'c', while Bob will try to remove those smallest integers from 'a' to make them unavailable for Alice.

Wait, but Bob can only delete one element per turn. So, his impact is limited.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have a certain number of each integer in 'a'. Alice can choose to include some of them in 'c', and Bob can delete others.

But it's not that simple because the turns alternate, and Alice has to choose which elements to include in 'c'.

I need to find a way to determine which elements will be in 'c' after the game ends and then find the MEX of 'c'.

Perhaps I should consider the number of times each integer appears in 'a' and see how many times Alice can include each in 'c'.

Given that Alice and Bob take turns, and Alice goes first, for each turn, Alice picks one element to include in 'c' and deletes it, and Bob picks one element to delete.

So, for each pair of turns (Alice's and Bob's), two elements are removed from 'a': one goes to 'c' and one is deleted.

Wait, no. Alice picks and appends to 'c', then deletes it from 'a'. Then Bob picks and deletes from 'a'. Then Alice again, and so on, until 'a' is empty.

So, for each two turns (Alice and Bob), two elements are deleted from 'a': one goes to 'c' and one is deleted.

Wait, but the number of turns depends on the size of 'a'.

Given that, the total number of elements in 'c' will be ceil(n/2), because Alice picks every other element.

Wait, let's think about it.

Alice starts by picking one element and appending it to 'c', then deleting it from 'a'. Then Bob picks one element and deletes it from 'a'. Then Alice again picks one element and appends it to 'c' and deletes it from 'a', and so on.

So, for every two elements removed from 'a', one goes to 'c' and one is deleted.

Therefore, the number of elements in 'c' will be roughly half of 'n', but depending on whether 'n' is odd or even.

Wait, more precisely, if 'n' is even, 'c' will have n/2 elements; if 'n' is odd, 'c' will have ceil(n/2) elements.

Wait, let's see:

- If n is even: Alice picks n/2 elements to include in 'c', and Bob deletes n/2 elements.

- If n is odd: Alice picks ceil(n/2) elements to include in 'c', and Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements.

But it's not that straightforward because their choices affect what's available in 'a'.

Given that, I need to find a way to determine which elements end up in 'c'.

Given that both play optimally, Alice will try to include the smallest possible integers in 'c' to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to prevent that by deleting elements that would help Alice.

Wait, but Bob's goal is to minimize the MEX of 'c', which means he wants the smallest missing integer in 'c' to be as small as possible. So, he would want to prevent Alice from including certain small integers in 'c'.

Wait, but Bob can only delete elements from 'a', not directly affect what Alice includes in 'c'.

So, perhaps Bob can try to delete elements that Alice wants to include, but since Alice picks first, she can choose to include elements that are still available.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I count the frequency of each element in 'a'.

Then, for each integer i starting from 0, I can check if there are enough occurrences of i in 'a' for Alice to include them in 'c' despite Bob's deletions.

In other words, for each i, calculate how many times i appears in 'a', and determine if Alice can include at least one i in 'c' for as many i's as possible.

Wait, but it's not just about including at least one of each i; it's about constructing 'c' with as many small integers as possible, considering the turns.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look at the provided code again.

The code counts the frequency of each element in 'a' using a Counter.

Then, it iterates from 0 to n-1:

- If i is not in mpp.keys(), meaning it doesn't appear in 'a', it prints i and breaks.

- If mpp[i] == 1 and first is True, it prints i and breaks.

- If mpp[i] == 1, it sets first to True.

Wait, this seems to be trying to find the smallest i that either doesn't appear in 'a' or appears only once after some condition.

But I'm not sure if this logic correctly captures the game's dynamics.

Let me consider some examples.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 4

a = [0, 0, 1, 1]

Possible game:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0, 0, 1]

- Bob picks 0, a = [0, 1]

- Alice picks 0, c = [1, 0], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

So, c = [1, 0], MEX is 2.

Another possible game:

- Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [0, 1, 1]

- Bob picks 1, a = [0, 1]

- Alice picks 1, c = [0, 1], a = [0]

- Bob picks 0, a = []

So, c = [0, 1], MEX is 2.

In both scenarios, MEX is 2.

Is there a way for Bob to make MEX smaller? Let's see.

Suppose:

- Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [0, 1, 1]

- Bob picks 0, a = [1, 1]

- Alice picks 1, c = [0, 1], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

So, c = [0, 1], MEX = 2.

Or:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0, 0, 1]

- Bob picks 1, a = [0, 0]

- Alice picks 0, c = [1, 0], a = [0]

- Bob picks 0, a = []

So, c = [1, 0], MEX = 2.

It seems that MEX is always 2 in this case, regardless of how they play.

Another test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 1, 2, 3]

Possible game:

- Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [1, 2, 3]

- Bob picks 1, a = [2, 3]

- Alice picks 2, c = [0, 2], a = [3]

- Bob picks 3, a = []

So, c = [0, 2], MEX is 1.

Another possible game:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0, 2, 3]

- Bob picks 0, a = [2, 3]

- Alice picks 2, c = [1, 2], a = [3]

- Bob picks 3, a = []

So, c = [1, 2], MEX is 0.

Wait, but the example output for this test case is 1. So, perhaps MEX can be 1 if played optimally.

But in the second game above, MEX is 0, which is smaller than 1, but maybe Bob can't force it to be 0.

Wait, perhaps Bob can't allow Alice to include both 0 and 1 in 'c'.

I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that Alice and Bob are playing optimally, with Alice trying to maximize MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.

Given that, the final MEX will be the smallest i such that Alice cannot include i in 'c', assuming both play optimally.

So, I need to determine, for each i from 0 upwards, whether Alice can include i in 'c' despite Bob's attempts to prevent it.

To do that, I need to calculate, for each i, whether the number of times i appears in 'a' is sufficient for Alice to include it in 'c', given that Bob can delete some of them.

Given that Alice picks first, and they alternate turns, for each i, if the frequency of i in 'a' is freq, then the number of times Alice can include i in 'c' is ceil(freq / 2).

Because for every two turns, Alice can include one i in 'c', assuming she picks i and Bob deletes another i.

Wait, more precisely, if freq is odd, Alice can include (freq + 1) / 2 instances of i in 'c'; if freq is even, Alice can include freq / 2 instances.

But since we're dealing with MEX, which only cares about whether i is present in 'c' or not, we only need to know if Alice can include at least one i in 'c'.

So, for each i, if freq_i >= 1 and freq_i - floor(freq_i / 2) >= 1, then Alice can include i in 'c'.

Wait, freq_i - floor(freq_i / 2) is the number of times Alice can include i in 'c'.

Wait, actually, the number of times Alice can include i in 'c' is ceil(freq_i / 2).

So, if ceil(freq_i / 2) >= 1, then Alice can include i in 'c'.

Which simplifies to freq_i >= 1.

Wait, but that can't be right because Bob can interfere.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose freq_i is the frequency of i in 'a'.

- If freq_i is 0, then i is not in 'a', so it's not in 'c', and MEX is i.

- If freq_i is 1, then Alice can include it in 'c' on her first pick, and Bob can't delete it before Alice picks it.

- If freq_i is 2, then Alice can include one in 'c', because even if Bob deletes one, Alice can pick the other.

- If freq_i is 3, Alice can include two in 'c', and so on.

Wait, more generally, for any freq_i >= 1, Alice can include ceil(freq_i / 2) instances of i in 'c'.

Since we only care about whether i is present in 'c' or not, we just need to check if ceil(freq_i / 2) >= 1, which is true as long as freq_i >= 1.

But that can't be right because Bob can try to prevent Alice from including i in 'c'.

Wait, no. If freq_i >= 1, Alice can always include at least one i in 'c', unless Bob deletes it before she can pick it.

But Alice picks first, so if there's at least one i in 'a', she can pick it on her first turn and include it in 'c'.

Wait, but if there are multiple elements, Bob might delete another i if freq_i > 1.

But in any case, if freq_i >= 1, Alice can pick it on her first turn and include it in 'c', provided that Bob doesn't delete it before she picks.

But since Alice picks first, and the elements are picked one by one, Alice can choose to pick i on her first turn, and since Bob picks after her, he can't delete it before she picks it.

Wait, no. Bob picks after Alice, so by the time Bob picks, Alice has already picked and included her element in 'c'.

So, if Alice picks i on her first turn, it goes to 'c', and Bob can delete another i if present.

But for MEX purposes, Alice has already included i in 'c', so it's present in 'c'.

Therefore, as long as freq_i >= 1, Alice can include i in 'c'.

Wait, but what if freq_i = 1, and Alice picks something else?

Then Bob could delete the only i, making it unavailable for Alice.

So, in that case, Alice needs to pick i on her first turn to ensure it's in 'c'.

But if she picks something else, Bob can delete i, making it unavailable.

So, to maximize the MEX, Alice needs to pick the smallest possible i that she can include in 'c'.

But Bob, trying to minimize the MEX, would want to delete elements that Alice wants to include.

This seems complex.

Perhaps a better approach is to iterate through i from 0 upwards, and check if freq_i >=1. If freq_i >=1, then Alice can include i in 'c', otherwise not.

But considering the game's turn structure, that might not be accurate.

Looking back at the first test case:

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

For i=0, freq=2, so Alice can include at least one 0 in 'c'.

For i=1, freq=2, so Alice can include at least one 1 in 'c'.

For i=2, freq=0, so MEX is 2.

Which matches the example output.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

For i=0, freq=1, Alice can include it.

For i=1, freq=1, Alice can include it.

For i=2, freq=1, Alice can include it.

For i=3, freq=1, Alice can include it.

So, c could have [0,1,2,3], MEX is 4.

But the example output for this test case is 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking back at the example output, for the second test case, it's 1, but according to my earlier logic, it should be 4.

Wait, perhaps I misread the test cases.

Wait, the second test case is:

4

0 1 2 3

And the output is 1.

Wait, but according to my logic, Alice can include all numbers from 0 to 3 in 'c', so MEX should be 4.

But the output is 1, so my logic must be wrong.

There must be something wrong with my reasoning.

Let me think again.

Perhaps Alice cannot include all numbers from 0 to 3 in 'c', because Bob can interfere.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], frequencies: 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1.

Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

Bob picks 3, a=[]

So, c=[0,2], which has MEX=1.

Alternatively, Alice could pick 1 first:

Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

Bob picks 3, a=[]

So, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

Wait, but the example output is 1, not 0.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the example output is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the first scenario, c=[0,2], MEX=1

In the second scenario, c=[1,2], MEX=0

So, the maximum MEX Alice can achieve is 1, by choosing to include 0 and 2.

Therefore, the output is 1.

So, Alice can choose to include 0 and 2, achieving MEX=1, and Bob can prevent her from achieving a higher MEX.

Hence, the output is 1.

So, in this case, Alice cannot include both 0 and 1 in 'c', because Bob can delete one of them.

Wait, no, in the first scenario, Alice includes 0 and 2, and Bob includes 1 and 3.

But in terms of 'c', c=[0,2], which misses 1, so MEX=1.

In another scenario, c=[1,2], which misses 0, so MEX=0.

So, the best Alice can do is to have MEX=1.

Therefore, the output is 1.

So, perhaps the rule is that for each i, if freq_i >=1, Alice can include it in 'c', unless Bob can force it to be deleted before Alice can pick it.

But in the second test case, with freq_i=1 for all i, Alice can include any two of them in 'c', but she can't include all four because n=4 and c will have only two elements.

Wait, no, with n=4, c will have two elements if n is even.

Wait, in the first scenario, c has two elements: [0,2]

In the second scenario, c has two elements: [1,2]

So, Alice can choose any two elements to include in 'c', but she needs to maximize the MEX.

To maximize the MEX, she should include the smallest possible integers that allow the highest possible MEX.

Wait, that might not make sense.

Perhaps a better approach is to iterate through i from 0 upwards, and check if Alice can include i in 'c'.

If she can, she includes it; if not, that's the MEX.

But how does that work with Bob trying to minimize it?

I need a more systematic way.

Let's consider that Alice can include ceil(freq_i / 2) instances of i in 'c'.

But since we only care about whether i is present in 'c' or not, if freq_i >=1, Alice can include it, because she can pick it on her turn before Bob deletes another one.

Wait, but in the second test case, with freq_i=1 for all i, Alice can include any two i's in 'c', but not all four because c will only have two elements.

Hence, she has to choose which two to include.

To maximize the MEX, she should include the two smallest i's possible, but in reality, she needs to include higher i's to make the MEX higher.

Wait, no, to maximize the MEX, she needs to include as many small i's as possible.

Wait, but in the second test case, including 0 and 2 gives MEX=1, while including 0 and 1 would give MEX=2, but that's not possible because Bob can delete one of them.

Wait, no, in the second test case, if Alice includes 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2, but according to the example output, it's 1.

Wait, no, in the second test case, the output is 1, but according to the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the second test case:

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible game:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

So, c=[0,2], MEX=1

Another possible game:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

So, c=[1,2], MEX=0

Another possible game:

- Alice picks 2, c=[2], a=[0,1,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,3]

- Alice picks 1, c=[2,1], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

So, c=[2,1], MEX=0

Another possible game:

- Alice picks 3, c=[3], a=[0,1,2]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,2]

- Alice picks 1, c=[3,1], a=[2]

- Bob picks 2, a=[]

So, c=[3,1], MEX=0

So, the best Alice can do is MEX=1, by including 0 and 2.

Hence, the output is 1.

Therefore, the logic should be: for each i from 0 upwards, check if Alice can include it in 'c'. If she can, include it; if not, that's the MEX.

But how to determine if Alice can include i in 'c'?

Given that Alice picks first, and both pick one element per turn, Alice can choose to include i in 'c' if freq_i >=1.

But Bob can try to delete i to prevent Alice from including it.

However, if freq_i >=1, Alice can pick it on her first turn before Bob can delete it.

Wait, but in the second test case, freq_i=1 for all i, and yet Alice can't include all i's in 'c' because c can only have two elements.

So, the issue is that c can only have ceil(n/2) elements, which in this case is 2.

Therefore, Alice can include only two distinct i's in 'c'.

Hence, the MEX will be the smallest i not included in 'c'.

Given that, to maximize the MEX, Alice needs to include the smallest possible i's in 'c' to push the missing i as high as possible.

But in practice, as shown in the second test case, including 0 and 2 gives MEX=1, while including 0 and 1 gives MEX=2, but the example output is 1, which contradicts.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the second test case, the output is 1, which matches including 0 and 2, MEX=1.

But including 0 and 1 would give MEX=2, but perhaps Bob can prevent that.

Wait, in the second test case, if Alice includes 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But according to the example output, it's 1, so perhaps that's not achievable.

Wait, no, the example output for the second test case is 1, but according to this, if Alice includes 0 and 1, MEX=2, which is higher than 1.

So, perhaps Bob can force the MEX to be 1 by deleting a specific element.

Wait, perhaps the optimal play leads to MEX=1, but Alice could achieve MEX=2 in a different play.

But according to the example, the output is 1, so perhaps in optimal play, MEX=1.

I need to understand the optimal strategy.

Let me consider that Alice wants to maximize the MEX, but Bob is trying to minimize it.

So, the final MEX is the smallest i such that Alice cannot include i in 'c', even with optimal play.

Given that, I need to find the smallest i for which Alice cannot include i in 'c', no matter how she plays, against Bob's optimal strategy.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the smallest i for which the number of times it appears in 'a' is less than what Alice needs to include it in 'c'.

Given that, perhaps if freq_i >=1, Alice can include it in 'c', unless Bob can delete it before Alice picks it.

But in reality, since Alice picks first, and Bob picks after, Alice can pick i on her first turn, include it in 'c', and Bob can only delete another element.

Therefore, if freq_i >=1, Alice can include i in 'c'.

But in the second test case, with freq_i=1 for all i, Alice can include any two i's in 'c', but not all four.

Therefore, she has to choose which two to include.

To maximize the MEX, she should include the two smallest i's that allow the highest possible MEX.

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Perhaps a better approach is to sort the unique elements in 'a' and select the first ceil(n/2) of them to include in 'c'.

But that might not account for Bob's interference.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Alice can include ceil(freq_i / 2) instances of each i in 'c'.

But since we only care about whether i is present in 'c' or not, if freq_i >=1, Alice can include it.

But in reality, she can only include ceil(freq_i / 2) instances.

Wait, no, for presence, if freq_i >=1, Alice can include at least one in 'c'.

But in the second test case, with freq_i=1 for all i, Alice can include any two i's in 'c', but not all four.

Hence, she has to choose which two to include.

To maximize the MEX, she should include the smallest possible i's to ensure higher i's are not missing.

Wait, no, to maximize the MEX, she should include the smallest i's possible so that the first missing i is as large as possible.

But in practice, as shown in the second test case, the best she can do is include two i's, say 0 and 2, resulting in MEX=1.

Alternatively, include 0 and 1, resulting in MEX=2.

But according to the example output, it's 1, so perhaps Bob can force MEX=1.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is that Alice can include any two i's, and Bob can force the MEX to be 1 by deleting specific elements.

But in one scenario, c=[0,1], MEX=2, which is better than 1.

So, perhaps the output is 1 because in some plays, MEX=1, but Alice can achieve MEX=2 in another play.

But the problem asks for the final score if both play optimally.

So, Bob would play to minimize the MEX, meaning he would choose deletions to minimize the MEX.

Therefore, in the second test case, Bob can force MEX=1.

Hence, the output is 1.

Given that, perhaps the logic should be:

- For each i from 0 upwards, check if the frequency of i is greater than or equal to ceil(freq_i / 2) >=1.

Wait, no, that's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Calculate how many elements Alice can include in 'c' for each i.

- Alice can include ceil(freq_i / 2) elements of i in 'c'.

- To maximize the MEX, Alice needs to include as many small i's as possible.

- Bob will try to minimize the MEX by preventing Alice from including certain i's.

- The final MEX will be the smallest i for which Alice cannot include it in 'c', given Bob's interference.

But in the second test case, with n=4 and a=[0,1,2,3], frequencies all 1, Alice can include any two i's in 'c'.

The best she can do is include 0 and 1, resulting in MEX=2.

But according to the example output, it's 1, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the number of elements Alice can include in 'c' is floor((n+1)/2).

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, floor((4+1)/2)=2, so c has 2 elements.

To maximize the MEX, Alice needs to include the two smallest i's possible.

But in this case, including 0 and 1 gives MEX=2, while including 0 and 2 gives MEX=1.

But according to the example output, it's 1, so perhaps the optimal MEX is 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can't always include the smallest i's.

But in the second test case, if Alice picks 0 first, c=[0], a=[1,2,3], then Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3], Bob picks 3, a=[].

So, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively, if Alice picks 1 first, c=[1], a=[0,2,3], Bob picks 0, a=[2,3], Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3], Bob picks 3, a=[].

So, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, the best Alice can do is MEX=1.

Hence, the output is 1.

Therefore, the logic should be:

- Determine the number of elements Alice can include in 'c', which is ceil(n/2).

- Alice needs to choose which elements to include in 'c' to maximize the MEX.

- Bob will choose deletions to minimize the MEX.

- The final MEX is the smallest i for which Alice cannot include it in 'c'.

Given that, perhaps the way to compute it is:

- Sort the unique elements in 'a'.

- Select the smallest ceil(n/2) unique elements to include in 'c'.

- The MEX will be the next smallest integer not included in 'c'.

But in the second test case, unique elements are [0,1,2,3].

ceil(n/2)=2.

So, select the smallest 2: 0 and 1, MEX=2.

But the example output is 1, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the frequencies.

Wait, in the second test case, frequencies are all 1, so Alice can only include one of each.

Hence, she can include any two unique elements.

So, selecting 0 and 1 gives MEX=2.

Selecting 0 and 2 gives MEX=1.

Selecting 1 and 2 gives MEX=0.

So, the best Alice can do is select 0 and 1, giving MEX=2.

But according to the example output, it's 1, which suggests that perhaps Bob can force MEX=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can delete elements in a way that forces a lower MEX.

In the second test case, if Alice picks 0 first, c=[0], a=[1,2,3], Bob picks 1, a=[2,3], Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3], Bob picks 3, a=[].

So, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively, if Alice picks 1 first, c=[1], a=[0,2,3], Bob picks 0, a=[2,3], Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3], Bob picks 3, a=[].

So, c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, the best Alice can do is MEX=1.

Hence, the output is 1.

Therefore, the strategy should be:

- Determine the number of elements Alice can include in 'c', which is ceil(n/2).

- Alice should include the smallest possible unique elements to maximize the MEX.

- Bob will try to force a lower MEX by deleting elements strategically.

- The final MEX is the smallest i for which Alice cannot include it in 'c', given Bob's optimal deletions.

Hence, in the second test case, Alice can include two elements, and the best she can do is include 0 and 2, resulting in MEX=1.

Therefore, the output is 1.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Sort the unique elements in 'a'.

- Determine the number of elements Alice can include in 'c', which is ceil(n/2).

- Find the smallest i such that the i-th unique element is not included in the first ceil(n/2) unique elements.

Wait, but that seems off.

Wait, in the second test case, unique elements are [0,1,2,3].

ceil(n/2)=2.

So, Alice can include the first two: 0 and 1, MEX=2.

But according to the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can delete elements to prevent Alice from including certain i's.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

- For each i from 0 upwards, check if the number of times i appears in 'a' is sufficient for Alice to include it in 'c', considering Bob's deletions.

- If freq_i >=1, Alice can include it in 'c', because she can pick it on her first turn before Bob can delete it.

- But in reality, Alice has to choose which elements to include in 'c', and Bob can delete elements to minimize the MEX.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Find the smallest i such that the number of times i appears in 'a' is less than ceil(freq_i / 2).

Wait, no, that's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through i from 0 upwards, and check if Alice can include i in 'c'.

- If freq_i >=1, Alice can include it.

- But in reality, she might not be able to include all i's she wants due to the limited number of elements she can include in 'c'.

Hence, perhaps the correct way is:

- Sort the unique elements in 'a'.

- Alice includes the smallest ceil(n/2) unique elements in 'c'.

- The MEX is the smallest integer not in 'c'.

But in the second test case, ceil(4/2)=2, so include the smallest two: 0 and 1, MEX=2, but the example output is 1.

This discrepancy suggests that my approach is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to consider that Alice can't always include the smallest ceil(n/2) unique elements due to Bob's deletions.

Wait, in the second test case, Alice can include any two elements, but depending on Bob's deletions, the MEX can be different.

Hence, perhaps the correct way is to find the smallest i such that the number of times i appears in 'a' is less than the number of times Alice needs to include it in 'c'.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me look back at the provided code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

mpp = Counter(arr)

first = False

for i in range(n):

if i not in mpp.keys():

print(i)

break

if mpp[i] == 1 and first:

print(i)

break

if mpp[i] == 1:

first = True

In this code, for each test case:

- Read n and the array arr.

- Count the frequency of each element using Counter.

- Iterate from 0 to n-1:

- If i is not in mpp.keys(), meaning freq_i=0, print i and break.

- If mpp[i] ==1 and first is True, print i and break.

- If mpp[i] ==1, set first to True.

So, essentially, it's looking for the smallest i that is not present in 'a', or present only once, with some condition.

But according to the second test case, where all frequencies are 1, it would print 2, because mpp[0]=1, sets first to True, then mpp[1]=1 and first is True, so it prints 1.

But according to the example, the output is 1, which matches.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], frequencies: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1.

So, iterating from 0 to 3:

- i=0: mpp[0]=1, sets first=True

- i=1: mpp[1]=1 and first=True, so prints 1 and breaks.

Hence, output is 1, which matches the example.

In the first test case, n=4, a=[0,0,1,1], frequencies: 0:2,1:2.

- i=0: mpp[0]=2, skips

- i=1: mpp[1]=2, skips

- i=2: not in mpp.keys(), prints 2 and breaks.

Hence, output is 2, which matches the example.

In the third test case, n=2, a=[1,1], frequencies:1:2.

- i=0: not in mpp.keys(), prints 0 and breaks.

Hence, output is 0, which matches the example.

So, the provided code seems to be correct, as it matches the example outputs.

But is this logic correct in general?

According to the earlier analysis, in the second test case, Alice can achieve MEX=2, but according to this code, it's outputting 1.

Wait, but as per the game plays I simulated earlier, the best Alice can do is MEX=1.

Hence, the code is correct.

Therefore, the logic in the code is correct.

Hence, the answer is True.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the final score of a game played by Alice and Bob on an array, where the score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array constructed by Alice. Both players play optimally, with Alice aiming to maximize the score and Bob aiming to minimize it.

### Approach

1. **Understanding MEX**: MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice starts first and picks an element to append to her array `c` and deletes it from the original array `a`.
   - Bob then picks an element from `a`, deletes it, and this alternates until `a` is empty.
   - The final score is the MEX of Alice's array `c`.
3. **Optimal Play Analysis**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, meaning she wants `c` to contain as many small non-negative integers as possible.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, meaning he wants to prevent Alice from including certain small integers in `c`.
4. **Strategy**:
   - For each integer `i` starting from 0, check if it is present in the original array `a`.
   - If `i` is not present, it is immediately the MEX.
   - If `i` is present, but Bob can interfere by deleting instances, we need to determine if Alice can include it in `c`.

Given the turn-based nature and optimal play, the solution provided uses a frequency count to determine the smallest integer not present or present only once, considering the turns of Alice and Bob.

### Solution Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    ptr = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[ptr])
        ptr += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[ptr:ptr + n]))
        ptr += n
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (size of the array) and the array `a`.

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in `a`.

3. **Determine MEX**:
   - Iterate from `0` to `n-1`:
     - If the integer `i` is not present in the array (`i not in mpp`), it is the MEX.
     - If `i` is present only once and a previous integer was also present only once (`mpp[i] == 1 and first`), print `i` as MEX.
     - Track the first occurrence of an integer with frequency 1.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify the smallest integer not present in Alice's final array `c`, considering the optimal plays of both Alice and Bob.
