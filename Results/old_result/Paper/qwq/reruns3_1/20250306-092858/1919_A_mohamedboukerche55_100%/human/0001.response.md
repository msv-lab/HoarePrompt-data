Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob where they have some coins in their wallets and they take turns making moves according to certain rules. The goal is to determine who will win if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice and Bob have a certain number of coins in their wallets, specified by a and b respectively. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to either exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet. After that, they must remove one coin from their current wallet, and the wallet can't have zero coins before removing.

The player who can't make a valid move loses. So, I need to figure out, for given a and b, who will win the game if both play optimally.

I should look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

1 1

Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 1 coin.

Alice's move:

- She can choose to not swap wallets. So, she removes 1 coin from her wallet, now a=0, b=1.

Bob's move:

- His wallet has 1 coin, so he can choose to not swap. He removes 1 coin, now a=0, b=0.

Alice's move:

- Both wallets are empty, so she can't remove a coin. Therefore, she loses, and Bob wins.

In the second test case:

1 4

Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 4 coins.

Alice's move:

- She can choose to swap wallets. So, now a=4, b=1.

Bob's move:

- He can choose to swap wallets back. So, a=1, b=4.

Alice's move:

- She chooses not to swap. Removes 1 coin, a=0, b=4.

Bob's move:

- He can't swap because his wallet has 4 coins, but if he swaps, a=4, b=0. He chooses not to swap, removes 1 coin, a=0, b=3.

Alice's move:

- She swaps wallets, a=3, b=0.

Bob's move:

- He can't swap because his wallet has 0 coins. So, he removes 1 coin from his wallet, a=3, b=0.

Alice's move:

- She swaps wallets, a=0, b=2.

Bob's move:

- He can't swap, removes 1 coin, a=0, b=1.

Alice's move:

- She swaps wallets, a=0, b=0.

Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

From these examples, it seems that swapping wallets can be a strategic move to force the opponent into a losing position. I need to find a general strategy that determines the winner based on the initial values of a and b.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory. This is an impartial game, meaning that the set of moves available depends only on the position and not on which player's turn it is. However, in this case, the moves do depend on whose turn it is because the players have different wallets.

But perhaps I can model this game in a way that makes it easier to analyze. Let's consider the total number of coins, t = a + b. In each turn, one coin is removed from the total, so t decreases by 1 each turn.

Wait, but actually, only one player's coins are reduced each turn, so the total number of coins decreases by 1 each turn until one player is unable to make a move.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty because the player cannot remove a coin from an empty wallet, and swapping wouldn't help.

So, the game continues until a + b = 0, but since a and b are non-negative integers, the game ends when a + b = 0.

But in reality, the game might end earlier if one player has no coins left and the other has coins, but the player with no coins can't make a move.

Wait, let's think differently. Each move consists of possibly swapping wallets and then removing one coin from the current wallet. The game continues until a player cannot make a valid move.

I need to find a way to determine the winner based on the initial values of a and b.

Let me try to find a pattern or a mathematical relationship that determines the winner.

Looking at the example outputs:

1 1 → Bob

1 4 → Alice

5 3 → Bob

4 5 → Alice

11 9 → Bob

83 91 → Bob

1032 9307 → Alice

839204 7281 → Alice

1000000000 1000000000 → Bob

53110 2024 → Bob

Looking at these, it seems that when a + b is even, Bob wins, otherwise Alice wins.

Wait, let's check:

1 + 1 = 2 (even) → Bob

1 + 4 = 5 (odd) → Alice

5 + 3 = 8 (even) → Bob

4 + 5 = 9 (odd) → Alice

11 + 9 = 20 (even) → Bob

83 + 91 = 174 (even) → Bob

1032 + 9307 = 1032 + 9307 = 1032 is even, 9307 is odd, sum is odd → Alice

839204 + 7281 = even + odd = odd → Alice

1000000000 + 1000000000 = even + even = even → Bob

53110 + 2024 = even + even = even → Bob

So, in all cases, when a + b is even, Bob wins, else Alice wins.

Is this always true?

Let me try to see if this makes sense.

If a + b is even, then the total number of moves possible is a + b, which is even. Since Alice moves first, if the total number of moves is even, then Bob makes the last move, which would mean Bob wins.

Wait, but in the first example:

a=1, b=1 → a+b=2, which is even. The game proceeds as follows:

1. Alice moves, a=0, b=1

2. Bob moves, a=0, b=0

3. Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

So, Bob makes the last move.

In the second example:

a=1, b=4 → a+b=5, which is odd.

1. Alice swaps, a=4, b=1

2. Bob swaps back, a=1, b=4

3. Alice removes, a=0, b=4

4. Bob removes, a=0, b=3

5. Alice swaps, a=3, b=0

6. Bob removes, a=2, b=0

7. Alice swaps, a=0, b=1

8. Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

So, Alice makes the last move.

This seems to hold.

So, in general, if a + b is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Is there any exception to this?

Let me try a=2, b=2:

a+b=4, which is even. So, Bob should win.

Game:

1. Alice moves, a=1, b=2

2. Bob moves, a=0, b=2

3. Alice moves, a=1, b=1

4. Bob moves, a=0, b=1

5. Alice moves, a=0, b=0

Bob makes the last move, so Bob wins.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, a + b = 4, even, so Bob wins.

Another test: a=3, b=2 → a+b=5, odd → Alice wins.

Game:

1. Alice moves, a=2, b=2

2. Bob moves, a=1, b=2

3. Alice moves, a=0, b=2

4. Bob moves, a=0, b=1

5. Alice moves, a=0, b=0

Alice makes the last move, so Alice wins.

Seems consistent.

Another test: a=1, b=1 → a+b=2, even → Bob wins. As in the first example.

Another test: a=1, b=2 → a+b=3, odd → Alice wins.

Game:

1. Alice moves, a=0, b=2

2. Bob moves, a=0, b=1

3. Alice moves, a=0, b=0

Alice makes the last move, so Alice wins.

Seems consistent.

So, the strategy seems to be that if a + b is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

This seems to hold for the examples and my test cases.

Therefore, the program provided is correct.

The program reads the number of test cases, t, and for each test case, reads a and b, and if a + b is even, prints "Bob", else prints "Alice".

This matches the strategy I derived.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Correct}}
