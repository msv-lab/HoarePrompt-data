Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Alice and Bob are playing a game with their wallets. Alice has A coins, and Bob has B coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to either exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses. We need to figure out who wins if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics properly. So, each turn, the player has two options:

1. Swap wallets with the opponent.

2. Keep their current wallet.

After choosing one of these, they must remove one coin from their current wallet. Importantly, the wallet can't have zero coins before removing the coin. So, if a player has a wallet with zero coins, they can't remove a coin and thus lose.

Okay, let's think about this step by step. Since both players play optimally, they will always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

Let me consider some small test cases to see if I can find a pattern or a general rule.

Test case 1:

A = 1, B = 1

- Alice's turn:

- Option 1: Swap wallets. Now, A = 1, B = 1. Alice removes one coin, so A = 0, B = 1.

- Option 2: Keep wallet. A = 0, B = 1.

- In either case, after Alice's move, A = 0, B = 1.

- Bob's turn:

- Bob has B = 1. He can choose to swap or keep.

- If he swaps, A = 1, B = 0. Then he removes one coin, so A = 0, B = 0.

- If he doesn't swap, he removes one coin, so A = 0, B = 0.

- In both cases, now both wallets are empty.

- Alice's turn:

- Alice has A = 0, which is empty, so she can't remove a coin. Thus, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins.

Test case 2:

A = 1, B = 4

- Alice's turn:

- Option 1: Swap wallets. A = 4, B = 1. Alice removes one coin, so A = 3, B = 1.

- Option 2: Keep wallet. A = 0, B = 4.

- Let's see both options.

- If Alice chooses to swap: A = 3, B = 1.

- Bob's turn:

- Bob has B = 1.

- Option 1: Swap wallets. A = 1, B = 3. Bob removes one coin, so A = 1, B = 2.

- Option 2: Keep wallet. A = 3, B = 0.

- If Bob chooses to swap: A = 1, B = 2.

- Alice's turn:

- Alice has A = 1.

- Option 1: Swap wallets. A = 2, B = 1. Alice removes one coin, so A = 1, B = 1.

- Option 2: Keep wallet. A = 0, B = 2.

- If Alice chooses to swap: A = 1, B = 1.

- Bob's turn:

- Bob has B = 1.

- Option 1: Swap wallets. A = 1, B = 1. Bob removes one coin, so A = 0, B = 1.

- Option 2: Keep wallet. A = 1, B = 0.

- If Bob chooses to swap: A = 0, B = 1.

- Alice's turn:

- Alice has A = 0, so she must choose to swap. A = 0, B = 1.

- Since A is still 0, Alice can't remove a coin. Thus, Bob wins.

Wait, but according to the example in the problem, Alice wins in this case. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the sequence.

Let me try again.

Alternative sequence:

- Alice chooses to swap: A = 4, B = 1 -> A = 3, B = 1.

- Bob chooses to swap: A = 1, B = 3 -> A = 1, B = 2.

- Alice chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 2.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 1.

- Alice chooses to swap: A = 0, B = 1.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

But the sample output says Alice wins. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the optimal play is different.

Let me try another sequence.

- Alice chooses to swap: A = 4, B = 1 -> A = 3, B = 1.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 3, B = 0.

- Alice chooses to swap: A = 0, B = 3.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 2.

- Alice chooses to swap: A = 0, B = 1.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Again, Bob wins, but the sample says Alice wins. So maybe swapping is not the best move for Alice.

Let's try if Alice doesn't swap.

- Alice chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 4.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 3.

- Alice chooses to swap: A = 0, B = 3.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 2.

- Alice chooses to swap: A = 0, B = 2.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 1.

- Alice chooses to swap: A = 0, B = 1.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Again, Bob wins. But according to the sample, Alice wins. So perhaps swapping is necessary at some point.

Wait, maybe Alice needs to swap at the right time.

Let's try a different sequence.

- Alice chooses to swap: A = 4, B = 1 -> A = 3, B = 1.

- Bob chooses to swap: A = 1, B = 3 -> A = 1, B = 2.

- Alice chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 2.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 1.

- Alice chooses to swap: A = 0, B = 1.

- Bob chooses to keep: A = 0, B = 0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Still Bob wins. But sample says Alice wins. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Perhaps there's a pattern based on the sum of A and B.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

1. 1 1 -> Bob

2. 1 4 -> Alice

3. 5 3 -> Bob

4. 4 5 -> Alice

5. 11 9 -> Bob

6. 83 91 -> Bob

7. 1032 9307 -> Alice

8. 839204 7281 -> Alice

9. 1000000000 1000000000 -> Bob

10. 53110 2024 -> Bob

Looking at these, it seems that when A + B is even, Bob wins, otherwise Alice wins.

Wait, let's check:

1. 1 + 1 = 2 (even) -> Bob

2. 1 + 4 = 5 (odd) -> Alice

3. 5 + 3 = 8 (even) -> Bob

4. 4 + 5 = 9 (odd) -> Alice

5. 11 + 9 = 20 (even) -> Bob

6. 83 + 91 = 174 (even) -> Bob

7. 1032 + 9307 = 1032 + 9307 = 1032 is even, 9307 is odd, so sum is odd -> Alice

8. 839204 + 7281 = even + odd = odd -> Alice

9. 1000000000 + 1000000000 = even + even = even -> Bob

10. 53110 + 2024 = even + even = even -> Bob

Yes, it matches the sample outputs. So, it seems that if A + B is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Is this always true? Let's see.

Consider A = 1, B = 1:

Sum = 2 (even) -> Bob wins. Matches sample.

A = 1, B = 4:

Sum = 5 (odd) -> Alice wins. Matches sample.

A = 5, B = 3:

Sum = 8 (even) -> Bob wins. Matches sample.

A = 4, B = 5:

Sum = 9 (odd) -> Alice wins. Matches sample.

A = 11, B = 9:

Sum = 20 (even) -> Bob wins. Matches sample.

A = 83, B = 91:

Sum = 174 (even) -> Bob wins. Matches sample.

A = 1032, B = 9307:

Sum = 1032 + 9307 = 1032 is even, 9307 is odd -> sum is odd -> Alice wins. Matches sample.

A = 839204, B = 7281:

839204 is even, 7281 is odd -> sum is odd -> Alice wins. Matches sample.

A = 1000000000, B = 1000000000:

Sum = even + even = even -> Bob wins. Matches sample.

A = 53110, B = 2024:

Both even -> sum even -> Bob wins. Matches sample.

So, it seems that the sum of A and B determines the winner: if the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Is there a mathematical explanation for this?

Let's think in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games where the set of moves available depends only on the position and not on which player's turn it is.

In this game, the players can choose to swap or not swap wallets and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a move because their wallet is empty.

This seems similar to a Nim game, where the number of coins in each pile represents the game state, and players reduce the piles in certain ways.

In this case, since there are two wallets, it's like a game with two piles. The operation of swapping wallets changes which pile you're affecting.

But in standard Nim, the XOR of the pile sizes determines the winner. However, in this problem, it seems that just the sum's parity decides the winner.

Let me see if I can find a general strategy based on the sum's parity.

Suppose A + B is even.

Then, if Alice moves first, and the sum is even, Bob wins.

If A + B is odd, Alice wins.

Is there a way to prove this?

Let's try to see what happens when A + B is even.

Alice's move:

- Option 1: Swap wallets. Then A becomes B, B becomes A. So A' = B, B' = A.

- Option 2: Keep wallets. A' = A - 1, B' = B.

Similarly, Bob's move would be:

- Option 1: Swap wallets. A' = B, B' = A.

- Option 2: Keep wallets. A' = A, B' = B - 1.

Wait, but after swapping, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.

So, if Alice chooses to swap, then A becomes B, B becomes A, then Alice removes one coin from her current wallet, which is now B.

So, A remains B, and B becomes A - 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, if Alice chooses to swap, then her wallet is now B, and she removes one coin from it, so B becomes B - 1, and A remains A.

Similarly, if she chooses not to swap, she removes one coin from A, so A becomes A - 1.

So, after Alice's move:

- If she swaps: A remains A, B becomes B - 1.

- If she doesn't swap: A becomes A - 1, B remains B.

Wait, no. If she swaps, she exchanges wallets, so her wallet is now B, and she removes one coin from it, so B becomes B - 1. A remains the same.

If she doesn't swap, she keeps her wallet and removes one coin from A, so A becomes A - 1.

Similarly, for Bob's move:

- If he swaps: A becomes A - 1, B remains B.

- If he doesn't swap: A remains A, B becomes B - 1.

Wait, no. If Bob swaps, he exchanges wallets, so his wallet is now A, and he removes one coin from it, so A becomes A - 1, and B remains B.

If he doesn't swap, he keeps his wallet and removes one coin from B, so B becomes B - 1.

So, in general, each move consists of:

- Choose to swap wallets, then remove one coin from the opponent's original wallet.

- Or keep the wallet, and remove one coin from your own wallet.

Wait, no. If you swap, you exchange wallets, then remove one coin from your current wallet, which was the opponent's wallet before swapping.

So, swapping effectively means you're removing one coin from the opponent's original wallet.

Not swapping means you remove one coin from your own wallet.

So, each move, the player chooses to remove one coin from either their own wallet or the opponent's wallet, depending on whether they choose to swap or not.

So, in essence, each move, the player chooses to decrement either A or B by one, based on whether they swap or not.

This makes the game similar to a game where players take turns decrementing either A or B by one, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

This is similar to the game of Nim with two heaps, where players can remove one object from a heap in each turn.

In standard Nim, the winning strategy is based on the XOR of the heap sizes. But in this case, it seems that just the parity of the sum decides the winner.

Wait, but in standard Nim with two heaps, where players can remove any number of objects from a single heap in each turn, the XOR determines the winner.

But in this variant, players can only remove one object from a heap in each turn.

This is similar to the game of Nim with the restriction that only one object can be removed from a heap in each turn.

In such a game, the winning strategy might be different.

Let me think about it.

If both A and B are zero, no moves can be made, so the current player loses.

If A + B is zero, which only happens when both are zero.

If A + B is odd, does that mean the first player wins? And if even, the second player wins?

Wait, in the earlier test cases, it seemed that way.

Let me see.

Consider A + B.

Each move, one coin is removed from the total sum.

The game ends when A or B reaches zero, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

Wait, but actually, the game ends when a player cannot make a move because their current wallet has zero coins.

But the wallet with coins can still be chosen for removal.

Wait, but there are constraints based on which wallet is chosen.

This seems more complicated than just removing one coin from a heap each turn.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the number of moves possible.

Each move removes one coin from either A or B.

The game ends when a player is faced with A or B being zero and cannot make a move.

Wait, but actually, the player can choose to swap or not swap, which determines from which pile the coin is removed.

This seems similar to a misère game, where the last move determines the winner.

But in standard Nim, misère games can be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a subtraction game on the sum A + B.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the parity of A and B.

Wait, looking back at the sample inputs:

When A + B is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

This suggests that the total number of moves is A + B, and depending on the parity, the winner alternates.

But let's think about it.

Each move reduces the total number of coins by one.

The game ends when one of the wallets is empty.

Wait, but the game doesn't necessarily end when all coins are removed; it ends when a player cannot make a move, which is when their current wallet has zero coins.

But with the rules, it's possible to have coins left but be unable to make a move.

Wait, no, if a player's current wallet has zero coins, they cannot remove a coin and thus lose.

So, the game ends when a player is forced to play with an empty wallet.

Given that, perhaps the total number of moves is A + B, and depending on who makes the last move, determines the winner.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of who makes the last move.

In standard impartial games, the player who makes the last move wins.

But in this game, the player who cannot make a move loses, which is similar.

So, if the total number of moves is A + B, and players alternate moves, then the player who makes the (A + B)-th move wins.

If A + B is even, the second player wins; if odd, the first player wins.

Wait, but in standard Nim, it's based on the XOR, not just the sum's parity.

But in this restricted version where only one coin can be removed at a time, perhaps the sum's parity determines the winner.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, it seems to match this pattern.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If A + B is even, Bob wins.

- If A + B is odd, Alice wins.

This seems to hold for all the sample inputs.

Therefore, the program provided:

def func():

test = int(input())

for t in range(test):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if a + b & 1 == 0:

print('Bob')

else:

print('Alice')

This program checks if A + B is even by using the bitwise AND operation with 1. If A + B is even, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, 'Alice'.

Given that our analysis suggests this is the correct approach, I would say that this program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on optimal play, given their initial coin counts in their wallets.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Alice and Bob alternately perform operations on their wallets.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet and then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game continues until a player cannot make a move (i.e., their current wallet has zero coins).

2. **Insight**:
   - The key observation is that the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.
   - If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The game can be modeled such that the total number of moves is determined by the sum of coins in both wallets.
   - Since Alice starts first, if the sum is odd, Alice makes the last move and wins; if even, Bob makes the last move and wins.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The solution is efficient as it only involves checking the parity of the sum of the coins, which is a constant-time operation.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, read the values of `a` and `b`.

- **Parity Check**:
  - Calculate the sum of `a` and `b`.
  - Use a bitwise AND operation with 1 to check if the sum is even or odd.
  - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), print 'Bob'; otherwise, print 'Alice'.

- **Optimal Play**:
  - The result is determined solely by the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.
  - This approach ensures that the solution is computed efficiently without simulating the entire game.

By following this approach, we ensure that the solution is both correct and efficient, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.
