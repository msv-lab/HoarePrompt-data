Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k. N seems to represent the length of the strings that I need to form using the first K lowercase English alphabets. And I need to create a string S such that all possible strings of length N from those K alphabets are subsequences of S. Moreover, I need the smallest possible S, and if there are multiple, any one of them is acceptable.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Given that, I need to make sure that every possible combination of length N from the first K alphabets is a subsequence of S.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

Input: 1 2

Output: ab

Possible strings of length 1 from the first 2 alphabets are "a" and "b". Both are present in "ab" as subsequences: "a" is the first character, and "b" is the second.

Second test case:

Input: 2 1

Output: aa

Only possible string is "aa", and it's present as a subsequence in "aa".

Third test case:

Input: 2 2

Output: baab

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". All of these are supposed to be subsequences of "baab", as explained in the note.

Fourth test case:

Input: 2 3

Output: abcbac

Possible strings: All combinations of two letters from "a", "b", "c", which are "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc". Each of these is a subsequence of "abcbac", as per the note.

Okay, so the goal is to construct S in such a way that it contains all possible combinations of length N from the first K alphabets as subsequences, and S should be as short as possible.

I need to think about how to minimize the length of S while ensuring that all these combinations are subsequences.

Let me consider the simplest case where N=1. In this case, S just needs to contain all K alphabets at least once, because each alphabet is a string of length 1, and they need to be subsequences of S. So, the minimal S would just be the concatenation of these K alphabets in some order.

Wait, but looking back at the first test case, where N=1 and K=2, S is "ab", which is indeed the concatenation of the first two alphabets.

In the second test case, N=1 and K=1, S is "a" repeated twice, which is "aa". But wait, according to my earlier reasoning, S just needs to contain "a" at least once. Why is it "aa"? Oh, but in this test case, N=2 and K=1, so strings of length 2 from "a" only is "aa", and S needs to contain "aa" as a subsequence. So, S has to have at least two "a"s, in sequence, because "aa" requires two "a"s in order.

Wait, but in the second test case, the input is 2 1, which means N=2 and K=1, so S is "aa". That makes sense because "aa" is the only possible string, and it needs to be a subsequence of S.

Wait, but in the first test case, N=1 and K=2, S is "ab", which is correct because both "a" and "b" are present.

So, for N=1, S needs to contain each of the K alphabets at least once, but in the case where N=2 and K=1, S needs to contain "aa", which requires at least two "a"s in sequence.

Wait, but in general, for N >1, S needs to contain all possible combinations of length N from the K alphabets as subsequences.

I need a general strategy to construct S for any N and K.

I recall that in computer science, particularly in the context of de Bruijn sequences, we deal with sequences that contain all possible subsequences or substrings of a certain length. However, de Bruijn sequences are typically for substrings, not subsequences.

In this problem, we're dealing with subsequences, which are different from substrings because subsequences don't have to be contiguous.

So, perhaps there's a way to construct S such that it minimizes the total length while including all combinations as subsequences.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, for N=1, S just needs to include each of the K alphabets at least once, and the minimal S is just the concatenation of these K alphabets.

For N=2, things get more complicated because S needs to include all possible pairs of these K alphabets as subsequences.

For example, with K=2 and N=2, possible pairs are "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". S needs to include all of these as subsequences.

Looking back at the third test case, S is "baab", which contains:

- "aa" as positions 2 and 4: "baab"

- "ab" as positions 2 and 3: "baab"

- "ba" as positions 1 and 2: "baab"

- "bb" as positions 1 and 4: "baab"

So, it works.

But is this the minimal possible S? Maybe, but I need to confirm.

Similarly, for N=2 and K=3, S is "abcbac", which contains all possible pairs as subsequences.

I need to find a general way to construct S for any N and K, ensuring it's as short as possible.

Let me consider the number of possible strings of length N from K alphabets. It's K^N, since each position can be any of the K letters.

So, for N=2 and K=2, there are 4 possible strings.

For N=2 and K=3, there are 9 possible strings.

I need S to contain all of these as subsequences.

One naive way would be to concatenate all possible strings of length N, but that would be highly inefficient, as there would be a lot of overlap.

A better approach would be to find a sequence where these strings overlap as much as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of graph theory, where each node represents a string of length N-1, and edges represent the addition of a new character to form a new string of length N.

This sounds similar to how de Bruijn sequences are constructed, where edges represent the overlap of sequences.

But again, de Bruijn sequences are for substrings, not subsequences.

Subsequences are more flexible because they don't have to be contiguous, which means that the positions can be spread out in S.

This makes it potentially easier to include all subsequences compared to substrings.

Wait, perhaps I can think recursively.

For N=1, S is just the concatenation of all K alphabets.

For N=2, I need to ensure that for every pair of letters, there exists a subsequence in S that matches that pair.

One way to do this is to have a sequence where each letter is followed by all possible letters, but I need to minimize the total length.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of a universal string, which is a string that contains all possible strings of a certain length as subsequences.

I recall that the minimal length of such a string is known in some cases.

But for now, perhaps I can try to find a pattern in the given examples and generalize it.

Looking at the examples:

- For N=1, K=2: S="ab"

- For N=2, K=1: S="aa"

- For N=2, K=2: S="baab"

- For N=2, K=3: S="abcbac"

I need to see if there's a pattern here that can be generalized to any N and K.

Looking back at the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = ''

for j in range(97, k + 97):

s += chr(j)

if k == 1:

print(n * s)

else:

print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)

So, the program does the following:

- Reads the number of test cases T.

- For each test case:

- Reads N and K.

- Constructs a string S by concatenating the first K lowercase letters.

- If K == 1, prints S repeated N times.

- Else, prints S repeated (2 - (N == 1)) times.

Let's decode this.

First, s is constructed by concatenating the first K lowercase letters. So, for K=2, s="ab"; for K=3, s="abc", etc.

Wait, in the third test case, K=2, s should be "ab", but in the output, it's "baab". So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, in the code, the loop is from 97 to k+97, which is incorrect because chr(97) is 'a', chr(98) is 'b', and so on. So, for K=2, j goes from 97 to 99, so s = 'a' + 'b' = 'ab', not 'ba'.

But in the third test case, the output is "baab", which is different from 'ab' repeated twice, which would be 'abab'.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code or in my understanding.

Let's see:

For K=2, s='ab'

If N=2 and K=2, the code prints (2 - (2 == 1)) * s = (2 - 0) * 'ab' = 2 * 'ab' = 'abab', but the correct output is "baab".

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Similarly, for K=3 and N=2, s='abc', and (2 - (2 == 1)) * 'abc' = 2 * 'abc' = 'abcabc', but the correct output is "abcbac".

So, the code is incorrect because it doesn't match the expected outputs for those test cases.

Wait, but in the first test case, N=1 and K=2, s='ab', and since K !=1, it prints (2 - (1 ==1)) * 'ab' = (2 - 1) * 'ab' = 1 * 'ab' = 'ab', which matches the first test case.

In the second test case, N=2 and K=1, s='a', and since K==1, it prints n * s = 2 * 'a' = 'aa', which matches the second test case.

In the third test case, N=2 and K=2, it prints 'abab', but the correct output is "baab". So, it's incorrect for this test case.

In the fourth test case, N=2 and K=3, it prints 'abcabc', but the correct output is "abcbac". So, again, incorrect.

Therefore, the code is not producing the correct outputs for K >=2 and N=2.

So, the code is incorrect.

But perhaps there is a pattern in the provided outputs that can be generalized.

Looking at the outputs:

- For N=1, K=2: "ab"

- For N=2, K=1: "aa"

- For N=2, K=2: "baab"

- For N=2, K=3: "abcbac"

I need to find a pattern or a method to construct S for any N and K.

Let me consider that for N=2 and K=2, "baab" works, but "abab" doesn't necessarily work correctly in all cases, as per the code's mistake.

Wait, but according to the code, for N=2 and K=2, it outputs "abab", but the correct output is "baab". So, perhaps "abab" doesn't cover all subsequences correctly.

Let me check:

Possible strings for N=2 and K=2: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

In "abab":

- "aa": positions 1 and 3: 'a','a'

- "ab": positions 1 and 2: 'a','b'; or positions 2 and 4: 'b','a' (but that's "ba", not "ab"). Wait, positions 1 and 2: 'a','b' -> "ab"

- "ba": positions 2 and 3: 'b','a'

- "bb": positions 2 and 4: 'b','a' (again "ba", not "bb"). Wait, there's only one 'b' followed by 'a', not 'b'.

Wait, in "abab", for "bb", we need two 'b's in sequence as a subsequence. But in "abab", the 'b's are at positions 2 and 4: 'b','a', which doesn't give "bb" because the second 'b' is followed by 'a', but we can't pick the second 'b' without considering what comes after.

Wait, to have "bb" as a subsequence, we need at least two 'b's in S, and we can pick any two 'b's in order. In "abab", there are two 'b's at positions 2 and 4. So, picking the first and the second 'b's gives "bb", even if there's an 'a' in between.

So, "abab" does contain "bb" as a subsequence.

Wait, but according to the code's output, "abab" is incorrect compared to the provided correct output "baab". But actually, "abab" does contain all subsequences "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb".

Wait, maybe "baab" is shorter or something, but both have the same length.

Wait, "abab" and "baab" both have length 4, and both contain all required subsequences.

So, perhaps the code's output "abab" is also correct, even though it's different from the provided "baab".

But in the fourth test case, for N=2 and K=3, the code would output "abcabc", but the provided correct output is "abcbac".

Both have length 6, and apparently, "abcbac" contains all required subsequences, whereas "abcabc" might not, or perhaps it does, but "abcbac" is lexicographically smaller or something.

Wait, I need to verify if "abcabc" contains all possible two-letter combinations from "a", "b", "c".

Possible combinations:

"aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc"

Let's check "abcabc":

- "aa": positions 1 and 4: 'a','a'

- "ab": positions 1 and 2: 'a','b'; positions 1 and 5: 'a','c' (not 'ab'); positions 2 and 4: 'b','a' (not 'ab'); positions 2 and 5: 'b','c'; positions 3 and 6: 'c','c' (not 'ab'); doesn't seem to have "ab" in positions other than 1 and 2.

Wait, but "ab" is directly at positions 1 and 2.

- "ac": positions 1 and 3: 'a','c'

- "ba": positions 2 and 4: 'b','a'

- "bb": positions 2 and 5: 'b','c' (not 'bb'); positions 4 and 5: 'a','c' (not 'bb'); no two 'b's in sequence.

Wait, there's only one 'b' in "abcabc", positions 2 and 5, but they are 'b' and 'c', not 'b' followed by another 'b'.

Wait, in "abcabc", there are two 'b's at positions 2 and 5.

So, picking positions 2 and 5: 'b','c' -> not "bb"

Picking positions 2 and 5: 'b','c' -> "bc"

Picking positions 2 and 6: 'b','c' -> "bc"

Wait, but to get "bb", I need to pick two 'b's in order, but in "abcabc", the 'b's are at positions 2 and 5, and between them is 'c', so the subsequence "bb" can be formed by picking positions 2 and 5.

Wait, but "b" at position 2 and "b" at position 5, ignoring the 'c' in between, gives "bb".

So, "bb" is present as a subsequence in "abcabc".

Wait, but according to the provided correct output "abcbac", it also contains "bb" as a subsequence.

So, perhaps both are correct, but "abcbac" is lexicographically smaller or something.

But in terms of length, both are of length 6.

Wait, perhaps the provided correct output is just one of the possible minimal length strings, and "abcabc" is another one.

But the code outputs "abcabc", which seems acceptable, but for K=2 and N=2, the code outputs "abab", which is different from the provided "baab", but both are of the same length and seem correct.

So, perhaps there are multiple correct answers, and the code is providing one such answer, but not matching the provided one.

But in the third test case, for N=2 and K=2, the code outputs "abab", but the provided correct output is "baab". Both are correct, as both contain all required subsequences and have the same length.

Similarly, for N=2 and K=3, the code outputs "abcabc", while the provided correct output is "abcbac". Again, both seem correct.

So, perhaps the code is acceptable, as it provides a string that contains all required subsequences and has the minimal length.

But according to the problem statement, "if there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them."

So, as long as the string has the smallest possible length and contains all required subsequences, it's acceptable.

Given that, the code seems to be providing such strings.

But in the third test case, "abab" and "baab" both have length 4, which seems minimal.

Similarly, "abcabc" and "abcbac" both have length 6.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

But I need to verify if this approach works for all N and K.

Let me consider N=3 and K=2.

Possible strings: "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb"

I need to construct S such that all these are subsequences of S.

If I use the code's approach, s = 'ab', and since K !=1, print (2 - (3==1)) * s = (2 - 1) * 'ab' = 'ab'

But "ab" doesn't contain "aaa", "aab", etc. as subsequences.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect for N >=3.

Wait, but according to the problem constraints, T can be up to 676, and N up to 26, but in the example, T=4 and N up to 2.

So, perhaps the code only works for N=1 and N=2, but not for higher N.

But the problem requires it to work for N up to 26.

So, perhaps the code is incomplete or incorrect.

Wait, but in the third test case, N=2 and K=2, the code outputs "abab", which seems correct, but for N=3 and K=2, it would output "ab", which is insufficient.

So, the code is incorrect for N >=3.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem only shows test cases up to N=2, and for those, the code seems to produce correct outputs, but for higher N, it fails.

So, perhaps the code is incomplete and only handles N=1 and N=2 correctly.

But the problem requires it to handle N up to 26.

So, the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a pattern for N=2 that doesn't hold for higher N.

Wait, perhaps for N=2, the minimal S is of length 2*K, but for higher N, it's different.

But I need to find a general solution.

Let me think differently.

I need to cover all possible sequences of length N from K alphabets as subsequences.

One way to think about this is to construct a string that includes all possible sequences in a way that maximizes overlap.

This sounds similar to a de Bruijn sequence, but for subsequences instead of substrings.

In de Bruijn sequences, for substrings, the minimal length is K*N, but for subsequences, it's different.

I recall that the minimal length of a string containing all possible subsequences of length N from K symbols is K choose N, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I need to look into the theory of universal strings for subsequences.

Upon a quick search, I find that the minimal length of a string containing all possible subsequences of length N from K symbols is known and can be constructed using a method similar to a de Bruijn sequence for subsequences.

But perhaps that's too complicated for this problem.

Alternatively, I can think recursively.

For N=1, as we saw, S is just the concatenation of all K symbols.

For N=2, I need to ensure that for every pair of symbols, there exists at least one subsequence in S that matches that pair.

One way to do this is to have a string where each symbol is followed by all possible symbols, but in a minimal way.

For example, for K=2 and N=2, "baab" works, as shown in the example.

Similarly, for K=3 and N=2, "abcbac" works.

But generalizing this for any N and K is tricky.

Alternatively, I can consider that for N=2, the minimal string can be constructed by concatenating all possible pairs of symbols in a specific order to minimize overlaps.

But this seems error-prone.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the code's approach is acceptable for small N and K, but not for larger values.

Given that, the code is incorrect because it doesn't handle N >=3 correctly.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in `s`. The goal is to create the smallest possible `s` that satisfies this condition.

## Approach

1. **Understanding Subsequences**: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. **Constructing the String `s`**:
    - For `n=1`, `s` just needs to contain each of the `k` alphabets at least once.
    - For `n=2`, `s` needs to contain all possible pairs of these `k` alphabets as subsequences.
    - For higher values of `n`, the construction becomes more complex and would require a systematic way to ensure all combinations are covered with minimal redundancy.

3. **Handling Specific Cases**:
    - When `k=1`, the string `s` must consist of the single character repeated `n` times.
    - For other cases, a general pattern needs to be followed to minimize the length of `
