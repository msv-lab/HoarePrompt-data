Alright, I have this problem to solve. Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The goal is to determine if he can form a different rectangle, considering that rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He can make a cut parallel to one of its sides, meaning he can either cut along the length or along the width. This will result in two smaller rectangles, both with integer dimensions since the original rectangle has integer sides.

After cutting, he can rotate and move these two rectangles to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle should be different from the original one, and again, rectangles that are just rotations of each other are considered the same. For example, a 2x6 rectangle is considered the same as a 6x2 rectangle.

The task is to determine, for given a and b, whether it's possible for Bob to create a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

Let me look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

Input: 1 1

Output: No

Explanation: A 1x1 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles because both dimensions are 1, and cutting would result in non-integer dimensions, which is not allowed. So, no new rectangle can be formed.

In the second test case:

Input: 2 1

Output: No

Explanation: A 2x1 rectangle can be cut into two 1x1 rectangles. From these two 1x1 rectangles, the only possible rectangle is 1x2 or 2x1, which is the same as the original 2x1 rectangle. So, no new rectangle can be formed.

In the third test case:

Input: 2 6

Output: Yes

Explanation: A 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles. From these two 2x3 rectangles, we can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 rectangle.

In the fourth test case:

Input: 3 2

Output: Yes

Explanation: A 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles. From these two 3x1 rectangles, we can form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2 rectangle.

In the fifth test case:

Input: 2 2

Output: Yes

Explanation: A 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles. From these two 1x2 rectangles, we can form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2 rectangle.

In the sixth test case:

Input: 2 4

Output: Yes

Explanation: A 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles. From these two 2x2 rectangles, we can form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x4 rectangle, so no new rectangle is formed. Wait, but the output is "Yes", which contradicts my understanding. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look back at the problem statement. It says that if the new rectangle is different from the original one, then it's "Yes"; otherwise, "No". But in this case, forming a 4x2 rectangle from a 2x4 rectangle is the same, so it should be "No". But the output is "Yes", so perhaps there's another way to form a different rectangle.

Wait, maybe I need to consider cutting in different ways. For a 2x4 rectangle, if I cut parallel to the length, I can get two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original. But if I cut parallel to the width, I can get two 1x4 rectangles. From these two 1x4 rectangles, I can form an 2x4 rectangle, which is the same as the original, or a 4x2 rectangle, which is again the same. So, in this case, it seems like no new rectangle can be formed. But the output is "Yes", so maybe I'm missing a possibility.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let's think differently. Maybe there's a general approach to this problem.

Let me try to find a general solution.

First, Bob can make a cut parallel to one of the sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles. Then, he can arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

Given that, let's consider the possible ways to cut the original rectangle.

Case 1: Cut parallel to the length (a is the length being cut).

Suppose a is even, so he can cut it into two rectangles of size (a/2) x b.

Then, from these two rectangles, he can arrange them in two ways:

- Place them side by side horizontally: forming a rectangle of size (a/2 + a/2) x b = a x b, which is the same as the original.

- Place them side by side vertically: forming a rectangle of size (a/2) x (b + b) = (a/2) x 2b.

But (a/2) x 2b is the same as a x b, since a/2 * 2b = a*b.

Wait, no. a/2 * 2b = a*b, but the dimensions are different: a x b vs (a/2) x 2b.

But according to the problem, rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same. So, is (a/2) x 2b the same as 2b x a/2, which would be considered the same as a x b?

Wait, no. The problem says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same. So, for example, 2 x 3 is the same as 3 x 2.

But in this case, (a/2) x 2b could be different from a x b unless a/2 = b or something like that.

Wait, let's take an example.

Suppose a=4, b=2.

Cut parallel to the length: cut a into two 2's, so two rectangles of 2x2.

From these two 2x2 rectangles, you can arrange them to form:

- 4x2: same as original 4x2.

- 2x4: which is the same as 4x2 by rotation.

So, no new rectangle is formed.

But according to the sample input, for 2 4, the output is "Yes", which contradicts this.

Wait, maybe I need to consider cutting parallel to the width.

Cut parallel to the width: cut b into two parts.

Given a=4, b=2.

If b is even, say b=2, cut into two 4x1 rectangles.

From two 4x1 rectangles, you can arrange them to form:

- 4x2: same as original.

- 8x1: which is different from 4x2.

So, in this case, you can form a new rectangle of 8x1, which is different from 4x2.

Hence, "Yes".

Ah, I see. So, in this case, cutting parallel to the width allows forming a new rectangle.

Similarly, in other cases, we need to check both possibilities: cutting parallel to the length and cutting parallel to the width, and see if any of them allows forming a new rectangle.

So, general approach:

For a given rectangle a x b:

- Check if a is even:

- If yes, cut into two rectangles of (a/2) x b.

- From these two rectangles, you can form:

- a x b (same as original)

- (a/2) x 2b

- If (a/2) x 2b is different from a x b, then "Yes"

- Similarly, check if b is even:

- If yes, cut into two rectangles of a x (b/2).

- From these two rectangles, you can form:

- a x b (same as original)

- 2a x (b/2)

- If 2a x (b/2) is different from a x b, then "Yes"

- If neither of these allows forming a new rectangle, output "No"

Now, to determine if (a/2) x 2b is different from a x b:

- Check if (a/2) x 2b != a x b and also consider rotation.

- Since a x b and b x a are considered the same, we need to check if (a/2) x 2b is the same as a x b or b x a.

- Similarly, for 2a x (b/2), check if it's different from a x b and b x a.

Let's formalize this.

Define a function to check if two rectangles are the same, considering rotation.

def same_rectangle(x, y, p, q):

return (x == p and y == q) or (x == q and y == p)

Then, for each cutting option:

- If a is even:

- New rectangle: (a/2) x 2b

- Check if same_rectangle(a, b, a/2, 2b)

- If not, then "Yes"

- If b is even:

- New rectangle: 2a x (b/2)

- Check if same_rectangle(a, b, 2a, b/2)

- If not, then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

Wait, but in the earlier example, for a=4, b=2:

- Cutting parallel to width: two 4x1 rectangles, forming 8x1.

- Check if 8x1 is the same as 4x2: same_rectangle(4,2,8,1)

- Check if (8==4 and 1==2) or (8==2 and 1==4): both conditions are false, so "Yes"

Hence, it's correct.

Similarly, for a=2, b=6:

- Cutting parallel to length: if a is even, which 2 is, cut into two 1x6 rectangles, forming 2x6 (same as original) or 1x12.

- Check if 1x12 is the same as 2x6: same_rectangle(2,6,1,12)

- (1==2 and 12==6) or (1==6 and 12==2): both false, so "Yes"

Hence, it's correct.

For a=3, b=2:

- a is odd, so can't cut parallel to length.

- b is even, cut into two 3x1 rectangles, forming 3x2 (same as original) or 6x1.

- Check if 6x1 is the same as 3x2: same_rectangle(3,2,6,1)

- (6==3 and 1==2) or (6==2 and 1==3): both false, so "Yes"

Hence, correct.

For a=2, b=2:

- a is even, cut into two 1x2 rectangles, forming 2x2 (same as original) or 1x4.

- Check if 1x4 is the same as 2x2: same_rectangle(2,2,1,4)

- (1==2 and 4==2) or (1==2 and 4==2): both false, so "Yes"

Hence, correct.

For a=6, b=3:

- a is even, cut into two 3x3 rectangles, forming 6x3 (same as original) or 3x6.

- Check if 3x6 is the same as 6x3: same_rectangle(6,3,3,6)

- (3==6 and 6==3) or (3==3 and 6==6): second condition is true, so same.

- b is even? b=3, which is odd, so no other cutting option.

- Hence, "No"

But according to the sample input, for 6 3, the output is "No", which matches.

Wait, but in the earlier case for 2 4, it was "Yes", which matches our earlier conclusion.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Now, let's see the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given program:

for _ in range(int(input())):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):

return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'

Wait, this program only checks if b is even, and if it is, outputs "yes", else "no". That's it.

Is this sufficient?

Let's see with the sample inputs.

Sample Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Sample Outputs:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

According to the given program:

For each test case:

- If b is even, output "yes"

- Else, output "no"

So, for:

1 1: b=1, odd -> "no" (matches sample)

2 1: b=1, odd -> "no" (matches sample)

2 6: b=6, even -> "yes" (matches sample)

3 2: b=2, even -> "yes" (matches sample)

2 2: b=2, even -> "yes" (matches sample)

2 4: b=4, even -> "yes" (matches sample)

6 3: b=3, odd -> "no" (matches sample)

Hmm, it seems to match the sample outputs.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let's consider some cases where b is even.

Case 1: a=2, b=4

- b is even, so output "yes"

- As we saw earlier, cutting parallel to width: two 2x2 rectangles, forming 4x2 (same as original) or 2x4 (same as original). So, no new rectangle. But according to the program, it's "yes". But in the sample input, it's "yes", but according to our earlier reasoning, it should be "no" because no new rectangle is formed.

Wait, but in the sample input, for 2 4, output is "yes", but according to the program, it's "yes" because b=4 is even. But in reality, from 2x4, cutting into two 2x2 rectangles, and forming 4x2 or 2x4, which are the same as the original, so no new rectangle is formed. So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's "yes", which matches the program, but according to our reasoning, it should be "no". So, perhaps our earlier reasoning was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let's re-examine.

For a=2, b=4:

- Cutting parallel to length (a is even): two 1x4 rectangles, forming 2x4 (same as original) or 1x8.

- Check if 1x8 is the same as 2x4: same_rectangle(2,4,1,8) -> (1==2 and 8==4) or (1==4 and 8==2): both false, so "yes"

Hence, it's correct. I must have made a mistake earlier.

Similarly, for a=6, b=3:

- a is even, cut into two 3x3 rectangles, forming 6x3 (same as original) or 3x6.

- Check if 3x6 is the same as 6x3: same_rectangle(6,3,3,6) -> (3==6 and 6==3) or (3==3 and 6==6): second condition is true, so same.

- Hence, "no"

Which matches the sample input.

So, the program seems correct.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, we need to consider both possibilities: cutting parallel to length and cutting parallel to width.

But the given program only checks if b is even.

Wait, in the function func_1, it only checks if b is even.

But in our earlier reasoning, we need to check both possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be simplified.

Let me think differently.

Suppose a and b are both given in sorted order, a <= b.

Then, when we cut, we can cut parallel to a or parallel to b.

If we cut parallel to a, we get two rectangles of size (a/2) x b.

From these, we can form a rectangle of size (a/2) x 2b.

Similarly, if we cut parallel to b, we get two rectangles of size a x (b/2).

From these, we can form a rectangle of size 2a x (b/2).

Now, we need to check if either of these new rectangles is different from the original a x b, considering rotations.

So, for cutting parallel to a:

New rectangle: (a/2) x 2b

Check if (a/2) x 2b is different from a x b and b x a.

Similarly, for cutting parallel to b:

New rectangle: 2a x (b/2)

Check if 2a x (b/2) is different from a x b and b x a.

If either of these is different, then "Yes", else "No".

Now, let's see.

Define same_rectangle(x, y, p, q):

return (x == p and y == q) or (x == q and y == p)

Then, for cutting parallel to a:

if a % 2 == 0:

new_rect1 = (a//2, 2*b)

if not same_rectangle(a, b, new_rect1[0], new_rect1[1]):

return "Yes"

Similarly, for cutting parallel to b:

if b % 2 == 0:

new_rect2 = (2*a, b//2)

if not same_rectangle(a, b, new_rect2[0], new_rect2[1]):

return "Yes"

Else:

return "No"

But in the given program, it only checks if b is even, and if so, returns "yes", else "no".

Wait, but according to our logic, we need to check both possibilities: a even and b even.

But in the program, it only checks if b is even.

Wait, perhaps in the function func_1, it's supposed to be checking if b is even, but maybe there's more to it.

Wait, perhaps the program is incomplete, and there's more to func_1.

But in the given code, func_1 only checks if b is even and returns "yes" or "no" accordingly.

But according to our earlier reasoning, we need to check both a and b.

So, this seems incomplete.

But in the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Wait, but in the sample input, for a=2, b=4, output is "yes", which matches the program, but according to our earlier mistake, I thought it should be "no", but actually, it's "yes" because you can form a new rectangle of 1x8.

Similarly, for a=6, b=3, output is "no", which matches the program.

But wait, for a=3, b=2, output is "yes", which matches the program because b=2 is even.

But in this case, cutting parallel to b: two 3x1 rectangles, forming 3x2 (same as original) or 6x1, which is different.

Hence, "yes".

Similarly, for a=2, b=1, output is "no", because b=1 is odd, and a=2 is even, but in this case, cutting parallel to a: two 1x1 rectangles, forming 1x2 (same as original) or 2x1 (same as original). So, no new rectangle, hence "no".

Wait, but according to the program, for b even, output "yes", else "no".

But in the case where a is even and b is odd, it's possible to have "yes" if cutting parallel to a allows forming a new rectangle.

Wait, for a=4, b=3:

- a is even, cut into two 2x3 rectangles, forming 4x3 (same as original) or 2x6.

- Check if 2x6 is the same as 4x3: same_rectangle(4,3,2,6) -> (2==4 and 6==3) or (2==3 and 6==4): both false, so "yes"

Hence, even though b is odd, if a is even, and cutting parallel to a allows forming a new rectangle, it should be "yes".

But according to the program, it only checks if b is even. If b is even, "yes", else "no". It doesn't consider if a is even.

So, in this case, for a=4, b=3, according to the program, b=3 is odd, so "no", but according to our reasoning, it should be "yes".

But in the sample input, for a=3, b=2, which is similar, b=2 is even, so "yes", which matches.

But wait, in the sample input, a=6, b=3: b=3 is odd, a=6 is even, but according to our earlier reasoning, cutting parallel to a: two 3x3 rectangles, forming 6x3 (same) or 3x6 (same), so "no", which matches the program's output "no".

Similarly, for a=4, b=3: b=3 is odd, a=4 is even, cutting parallel to a: two 2x3 rectangles, forming 4x3 (same) or 2x6 (different), so should be "yes", but according to the program, b is odd, so "no", which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for a=4, b=3, it's not present, so maybe the program is incorrect for some cases.

Wait, but in the sample input, for a=6, b=3, which is similar, output is "no", which matches the program.

But for a=4, b=3, which is similar to a=6, b=3, according to our reasoning, it should be "yes", but the program would output "no".

Hence, the program is incorrect.

But in the sample input, for a=3, b=2, which is similar, output is "yes", because b=2 is even.

Wait, but in a=4, b=3, which should be "yes" according to our reasoning, but the program outputs "no" because b=3 is odd.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the correct approach should be:

- If a is even and (a/2) x 2b is different from a x b and b x a, then "Yes"

- Or if b is even and 2a x (b/2) is different from a x b and b x a, then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

Hence, the program should check both a and b.

But in the given program, it only checks if b is even.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, it seems to work because in cases where a is even and b is odd, but a/2 is such that (a/2) x 2b is different from a x b, it should be "yes", but the program would output "no" if b is odd.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer should be Correctness: False

But in the sample inputs, it matches, but it fails in some cases, as shown above.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
