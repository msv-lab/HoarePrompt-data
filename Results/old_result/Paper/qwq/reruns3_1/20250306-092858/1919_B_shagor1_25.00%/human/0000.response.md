Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in such a way that when I concatenate them, they form the original string. For each of these substrings, I calculate a penalty which is the absolute value of the sum of the corresponding values (1 for "+" and -1 for "-") multiplied by the length of the substring. My goal is to split the string in a way that minimizes the total penalty.

First, I need to understand what the penalty represents. For a substring, if it has more "+" than "-", its sum will be positive; if more "-", negative. Taking the absolute value and multiplying by the length means that the penalty is higher for longer substrings with a larger imbalance between "+" and "-".

I need to find a way to split the string to minimize the sum of these penalties. This sounds like an optimization problem, possibly solvable with dynamic programming.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

n = 1

s = "+"

a = [1]

If I split it into [1], the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1

That's the only way to split it, so the minimum penalty is 1.

Example 2:

n = 5

s = "-----"

a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

If I split it into [(-1), (-1), (-1), (-1), (-1)], each penalty is | -1 | * 1 = 1, total penalty is 5.

Alternatively, if I split it into [(-1, -1, -1, -1, -1)], the penalty is | -5 | * 5 = 25.

So, splitting into single elements gives a lower penalty.

Example 3:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+-

a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I split it into [(1, -1, 1, -1), (1, -1)], the penalties are |0|*4 + |0|*2 = 0 + 0 = 0.

That's interesting; if I can group the "+" and "-" in a way that their sums cancel out, the penalty can be zero.

Example 4:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++-

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

One way to split: [(-1, -1), (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), (-1)]

Penalties:

| -2 | * 2 = 4

|7| * 7 = 49

| -1 | * 1 = 1

Total: 4 + 49 + 1 = 54

But maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, split into [(-1), (-1), (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), (-1)]

Penalties:

| -1 | * 1 = 1

| -1 | * 1 = 1

|7| * 7 = 49

| -1 | * 1 = 1

Total: 1 + 1 + 49 + 1 = 52

Still high.

Wait, in the example output, it shows 4 for this case. How is that possible?

Let me calculate differently.

If I split into [(-1, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

Each pair has sum 0, penalty 0, but some might not be applicable if the splits don't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a better way to split.

Wait, the example output is 4, but I need to see how to achieve that.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach.

Looking at the program provided:

t = int(input())

while t:

func_1()

t -= 1

def func_1():

n = int(input())

s = input()

neg = 0

for i in s:

if i == '-':

neg += 1

print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)

So, it's counting the number of "-" signs, multiplying by 2, subtracting from n, and then printing that unless n equals neg, in which case it prints n.

Wait, in the first example:

n=1, s="+", neg=0, n-2*neg=1-0=1, which matches the first output.

Second example:

n=5, s="-----", neg=5, n-2*neg=5-10=-5, but n != neg, but it prints 5 according to the program.

Wait, but in the program, it prints n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n.

So, for n=5, neg=5, n == neg, so it prints n=5, which matches the second output.

Third example:

n=6, s="+-+-+-", neg=3, n-2*neg=6-6=0, which matches the third output.

Fourth example:

n=10, s="--+++++++-", neg=4, n-2*neg=10-8=2, but the example output is 4, which contradicts the program's output.

Wait, there must be something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example output.

Wait, the example output is:

1

5

0

4

So for n=10, it's 4, but according to the program, it should be 2, but the example output is 4.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of "-" in the fourth example.

n=10, s="--+++++++-", so neg=3, n-2*neg=10-6=4, which matches the example output.

So, neg=3, not 4.

Yes, s="--+++++++-", which is 3 "-" and 7 "+", so neg=3, n-2*neg=4, which matches the output.

So, the program seems to be correct in this case.

Wait, but according to the program, it's n - 2*neg unless n == neg, then it's n.

Wait, in the fourth example, n != neg, so it's n - 2*neg = 10 - 6 = 4, which matches the output.

Fifth example:

n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", let's count the "-":

 positions: 2,3,4,8,12,13,14,18,19,20, so neg=10

n - 2*neg=20-20=0, but the example output is 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

s="+---++++-+++++---++-"

Let's count "-":

positions: 2,3,4,8,12,13,14,18,19,20 -> total 10 "-"

n - 2*neg=20 - 20=0, but example output is 4, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the "-".

s="+---++++-+++++---++-"

Indices with "-":

2: -

3: -

4: -

8: -

12: -

13: -

14: -

18: -

19: -

20: -

That's 10 "-"

n=20, n - 2*neg=20 - 20=0, but example output is 4, which doesn't match.

So, the program seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the example output is wrong, or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says:

"Find the minimum possible penalty you will receive."

In the fifth example, with n=20 and s="+---++++-+++++---++-", the program outputs 4, but according to the program, it should be n - 2*neg=20 - 2*10=0, but the example output is 4.

Wait, perhaps the program has a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the program is correct, and I'm misunderstanding the calculation.

Let me try to understand the program's logic.

The program calculates neg, the number of "-" in the string.

Then, it computes n - 2*neg unless n == neg, in which case it prints n.

So, in the fifth example, n=20, neg=10, n - 2*neg=0, but the example output is 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the penalty is not simply n - 2*neg.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I split the string into substrings where each substring has an equal number of "+" and "-", then the sum of each substring would be zero, and thus the penalty would be zero.

However, if the number of "+" and "-" in the entire string is not equal, I might have some leftover that can't be perfectly balanced.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" multiplied by the length of the substring that has the imbalance.

But it's more complicated than that.

Wait, perhaps dynamic programming can be used here.

Let me try to model this with DP.

Let dp[i] represent the minimal penalty for the first i characters.

Then, for each i, I can consider all possible splits before position i.

So, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + penalty of substring from j+1 to i.

The base case is dp[0] = 0.

To compute the penalty of a substring from j+1 to i, I need to calculate the sum of the values in that substring and multiply by its length.

Wait, but n can be up to 5000, and t can be up to 1000, so a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a better way.

Perhaps I can find a mathematical formula to compute the minimal penalty directly.

Let me consider the entire string as one substring.

The penalty would be |sum(a)| * n.

Alternatively, if I split into single-character substrings, the penalty is sum over i=1 to n of |a[i]| * 1 = n, since |a[i]| is always 1.

So, in the first example, n=1, output=1.

In the second example, n=5, all "-", sum(a)=-5, | -5 | * 5 = 25, which is worse than splitting into single characters with penalty 5.

In the third example, n=6, with three "+" and three "-", if I split into two parts each with sum zero, total penalty is zero.

In the fourth example, n=10, with seven "+" and three "-", sum(a)=7 - 3 =4, so |4| * 10 = 40, which is worse than splitting into parts with smaller imbalances.

In the fifth example, with n=20, suppose there are 10 "+" and 10 "-", sum(a)=0, so |0|*20=0, which is better than splitting into parts with non-zero sums.

But according to the program, it's printing n - 2*neg=20 - 20=0, which matches the optimal penalty in this case.

Wait, but the example output is 4, not 0.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of "-" in the fifth example.

Let me check again.

s="+---++++-+++++---++-"

 positions:

1: +

2: -

3: -

4: -

5: +

6: +

7: +

8: +

9: -

10: +

11: +

12: +

13: +

14: +

15: -

16: -

17: -

18: +

19: +

20: -

So, positions 2,3,4,9,15,16,17,18,19,20 are "-", total 10.

So, sum(a) = 10 - 10 = 0, so |0|*20=0, which should be achievable by splitting into balanced parts.

But the example output is 4, which suggests that the minimal penalty is not zero in this case.

Wait, perhaps it's not possible to split into perfectly balanced parts.

Wait, in the fifth example, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", with 10 "+" and 10 "-", but perhaps no split allows all parts to have equal number of "+" and "-".

Wait, for example, if I split into substrings where each has an equal number of "+" and "-", but if the counts aren't matching, I might have余下的不平衡部分。

所以可能需要更仔细地考虑分割方式。

也许可以尝试计算字符串中“+”和“-”的前缀和，然后寻找分割点，使得每个子数组的和的绝对值乘以长度的和最小。

但这可能太慢了，因为n可以达到5000，t可以达到1000，总的时间复杂度会很高。

让我再看看程序的实现。

程序只是简单地计算了n - 2*neg，除非n等于neg，那样直接输出n。

在第四组样例中，n=10，neg=3，输出n - 2*neg=4，与样例输出一致。

在第五组样例中，n=20，neg=10，输出n - 2*neg=0，但样例输出是4，这与程序的输出不一致。

这表明程序是错误的。

所以，Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
