Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have an even number of integers on the board because it's 2n. I have to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the minimums of each pair is maximized.

Let me think about an example to grasp this better. Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

3

1

2 3

Output:

2

So, n=1, and the numbers are 2 and 3. I have to choose two numbers, take the minimum, which is 2, and that's my score. That makes sense.

Second test case:

Input:

2

1 1 2 1

Output:

2

Here, n=2, so 2n=4 numbers: 1,1,2,1. I need to perform 2 moves.

One way is to pair 1 and 1 first, get min(1,1)=1, score increases by 1. Then pair the remaining 1 and 2, get min(1,2)=1, score increases by another 1, total score 2.

Another way could be pairing 1 and 2 first, get min(1,2)=1, then pair the remaining 1 and 1, get min(1,1)=1, total score still 2.

Is there a way to get a higher score? If I pair 1 and 1 first, then 1 and 2, I get 2. If I pair 1 and 2 first, then 1 and 1, I get 2 again. Seems like 2 is the maximum possible.

Third test case:

Input:

3

1 1 1 1 1 1

Output:

3

Here, n=3, so 6 numbers, all 1s. No matter how I pair them, the minimum of each pair is 1, so total score is 3.

From these examples, it seems like the strategy is to pair the smallest available numbers together. That way, when you take the minimum of each pair, you're maximizing what you can get from the lower end.

Wait a minute, in the second test case, if I pair the smallest numbers together, I pair 1 and 1, get 1, then pair 1 and 2, get 1 again, total 2. Is there a better way? No, because all numbers are at least 1, and pairing a 1 with a 2 only gives you 1.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 with 2 first, getting 1, then pair the two 1s left, again getting 1, total is still 2.

So, pairing the smallest numbers together seems to be a good strategy.

Let me think about why this works. If I have two numbers, x and y, and x < y, then min(x,y) = x. If I pair x with another number that is less than y, say z, where z <= x, then min(x,z) = z, which could be less than x. But if z is greater than x, then min(x,z) = x.

Wait, z has to be less than or equal to x because x is already less than y.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should think differently.

Suppose I sort all the numbers in non-decreasing order. Then, the smallest n numbers are the ones I want to pair together to maximize the sum of their minimums.

Wait, in the second test case, the sorted list is [1,1,1,2]. So, the smallest n numbers are the first n numbers in the sorted list.

Wait, n=2, so 2n=4. The first 2 numbers are 1 and 1. So, if I pair them together, get min(1,1)=1, and then pair the next two, which are 1 and 2, get min(1,2)=1, total score 2.

Alternatively, if I pair the first and the second, get 1, then pair the third and fourth, get 1, total is 2.

Seems consistent.

In the third test case, all numbers are 1, so any pairing gives min=1, and sum is 3.

In the first test case, n=1, so 2 numbers: 2 and 3. Sorted: 2,3. Pair them, get min=2, total score=2.

So, the strategy seems to be: sort the list in non-decreasing order, and then sum up the first n numbers.

Because in each pair, the smaller number is contributed to the score, and by pairing the smallest numbers together, you're ensuring that you're not wasting larger numbers by pairing them with smaller ones.

Wait, in the second test case, if I pair 1 and 2, getting 1, and then pair the two 1s, getting 1, total is 2.

If I pair 1 and 1 first, getting 1, then pair 1 and 2, getting 1, total is still 2.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 and 1, and then 1 and 2, it's the same as pairing 1 and 1 first, then 1 and 2.

So, it seems that summing the smallest n numbers gives the maximum score.

Wait, but is there a way to get more than that?

Suppose I have numbers 1,2,3,4 with n=2.

If I pair 1 and 2, get 1, then pair 3 and 4, get 3, total score is 4.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 and 3, get 1, then pair 2 and 4, get 2, total score is 3.

Or pair 1 and 4, get 1, pair 2 and 3, get 2, total score is 3.

So, pairing the smallest together gives a higher score of 4.

Similarly, in the earlier test cases, summing the smallest n numbers gives the maximum score.

So, the strategy is to sort the list in non-decreasing order and sum the first n numbers.

Wait, but in the second test case, the first n numbers are 1 and 1, sum is 2.

In the third test case, the first n numbers are all 1s, sum is 3.

In the first test case, the first n=1 number is 2.

So, this seems to work.

Is there any case where this strategy fails?

Let me think about a different example.

Suppose n=2, numbers are 1,2,3,6.

If I pair 1 and 2, get 1, pair 3 and 6, get 3, total score is 4.

If I pair 1 and 3, get 1, pair 2 and 6, get 2, total score is 3.

If I pair 1 and 6, get 1, pair 2 and 3, get 2, total score is 3.

So, pairing the smallest together gives the highest score of 4.

Another example: n=3, numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3.

Sum of smallest 3 numbers: 1+1+2=4.

Alternative pairings:

Pair 1 and 1, get 1, pair 2 and 2, get 2, pair 3 and 3, get 3, total 1+2+3=6.

Wait, but according to the strategy, sum the smallest n numbers: 1+1+2=4.

But in this case, pairing like this gives a higher score of 6.

Wait, maybe I need to pair them differently.

Wait, if I pair 1 and 1, get 1, pair 2 and 2, get 2, pair 3 and 3, get 3, total is 6.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 and 2, get 1, pair 1 and 2, get 1, pair 3 and 3, get 3, total is 5.

Another way: pair 1 and 3, get 1, pair 1 and 3, get 1, pair 2 and 2, get 2, total is 4.

So, the highest is 6, which is pairing each identical numbers together.

But according to the initial strategy, sum the smallest n numbers: 1,1,2 sum to 4, which is less than 6.

So, in this case, the strategy fails.

Wait, but in the initial strategy, I thought summing the smallest n numbers would give the maximum, but here it doesn't.

Wait, maybe I need to pair the smallest with the next smallest each time.

Wait, in this example, pairing 1 with 1, get 1, pair 2 with 2, get 2, pair 3 with 3, get 3, total 6.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 with 2, get 1, pair 1 with 2, get 1, pair 3 with 3, get 3, total 5.

So, pairing smallest with smallest gives a higher score.

Wait, but according to the initial approach, sum the smallest n numbers: 1,1,2 sum to 4, but actually, by pairing appropriately, I can get 6.

So, my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the array and pair the smallest with the largest.

Wait, let's see.

In the earlier example with n=2, numbers 1,2,3,6.

If I pair 1 with 6, get 1, pair 2 with 3, get 2, total 3.

But earlier, pairing 1 with 1 and 2 with 2 gives 1+2=3, but pairing 1 with 2 and 3 with 6 gives 1+3=4, which is higher.

Wait, but in that case, pairing the smallest with the largest gives 1+3=4, which is higher than pairing smallest with smallest.

Wait, but in the previous example with n=3, numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3.

Pairing 1 with 3, 1 with 3, and 2 with 2 gives 1+1+2=4, which is less than pairing 1 with 1, 2 with 2, and 3 with 3, which gives 1+2+3=6.

So, in that case, pairing smallest with smallest gives the higher score.

Wait, but in the earlier n=2 example, pairing smallest with largest gives a higher score.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me think about the overall goal: to maximize the sum of the minimums of the pairs.

To maximize the sum of the minimums, I want the minimum of each pair to be as large as possible.

So, I should try to pair numbers in such a way that the smaller numbers are paired with larger numbers, but in a way that the minimum in each pair is as large as possible.

Wait, but in the n=2, numbers 1,2,3,6 example, pairing 1 with 2 gives min=1, and pairing 3 with 6 gives min=3, total=4.

Pairing 1 with 3 gives min=1, pairing 2 with 6 gives min=2, total=3.

Pairing 1 with 6 gives min=1, pairing 2 with 3 gives min=2, total=3.

So, pairing the two smallest together gives a better total.

Wait, but in the n=3, numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3 example, pairing the two 1s together gives min=1, pairing the two 2s together gives min=2, pairing the two 3s together gives min=3, total=6.

Whereas, pairing 1 with 3, 1 with 3, and 2 with 2 gives 1+1+2=4, which is less.

So, in this case, pairing like this gives a higher total.

So, perhaps the strategy is to pair identical numbers together, if possible.

Wait, but in the n=2, numbers 1,2,3,6 example, there are no identical numbers, but pairing the two smallest together gives a better total.

Wait, maybe the strategy is to sort the array and pair the smallest available numbers together.

In the n=2, numbers 1,2,3,6:

Sort: 1,2,3,6.

Pair 1 and 2, get 1.

Pair 3 and 6, get 3.

Total: 4.

Alternatively, pair 1 and 3, get 1.

Pair 2 and 6, get 2.

Total: 3.

So, pairing the smallest together gives a higher total.

In the n=3, numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3:

Sort: 1,1,2,2,3,3.

Pair 1 and 1, get 1.

Pair 2 and 2, get 2.

Pair 3 and 3, get 3.

Total: 6.

Which is higher than pairing 1 and 3, 1 and 3, 2 and 2, which gives 1+1+2=4.

So, pairing the smallest together gives a higher total.

Wait, but earlier I thought that summing the smallest n numbers would give the maximum score, but in this case, summing the smallest n numbers would be 1,1,2 sum=4, but pairing as above gives 6, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I need to pair the numbers in a specific way.

Wait, in the sorted list: 1,1,2,2,3,3.

If I pair 1 with 1, get 1.

Then pair 2 with 2, get 2.

Then pair 3 with 3, get 3.

Total: 6.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 with 2, get 1.

Then pair 1 with 2, get 1.

Then pair 3 with 3, get 3.

Total: 5.

So, pairing identical numbers together gives a higher total.

Wait, but in the n=2, numbers 1,2,3,6:

Pair 1 with 1 (but there's only one 1), so can't pair identical numbers.

So, pair 1 with 2, get 1.

Pair 3 with 6, get 3.

Total: 4.

Alternatively, pair 1 with 3, get 1.

Pair 2 with 6, get 2.

Total: 3.

So, pairing the smallest together gives a higher total.

Wait, perhaps the general strategy is to sort the array in non-decreasing order and pair the first with the second, the third with the fourth, and so on.

Wait, in the n=3, numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3:

Pair 1 and 1, get 1.

Pair 2 and 2, get 2.

Pair 3 and 3, get 3.

Total: 6.

In n=2, numbers 1,2,3,6:

Pair 1 and 2, get 1.

Pair 3 and 6, get 3.

Total: 4.

In n=1, numbers 2 and 3:

Pair 2 and 3, get 2.

This seems consistent.

So, the strategy is to sort the array in non-decreasing order and pair the first with the second, third with fourth, and so on, up to the 2n-1 and 2n-th elements.

Then, the sum of the minimums would be a[0] + a[2] + ... + a[2n-2].

Wait, in the sorted list, a[0] <= a[1] <= a[2] <= ... <= a[2n-1].

So, pairing a[0] with a[1], a[2] with a[3], ..., a[2n-2] with a[2n-1].

Then, the sum of the minimums would be a[0] + a[2] + ... + a[2n-2].

But in the n=3, numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3:

Sum would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Wait, but in the n=2, numbers 1,2,3,6:

Sum would be 1 + 3 = 4.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=1, numbers 2,3:

Sum would be 2.

Which matches the example outputs.

So, this seems to be the correct approach.

Now, looking back at my initial approach, I thought about summing the smallest n numbers, but in the n=3, numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3:

Sum of smallest n numbers would be 1+1+2=4, but the actual maximum score is 6.

So, summing the smallest n numbers is not the correct approach.

Instead, summing a[0] + a[2] + ... + a[2n-2] in the sorted array gives the correct maximum score.

Therefore, the correct strategy is to sort the array in non-decreasing order and sum every second element starting from the first.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

num = input()

out = []

for numbers in range(int(num)):

list2 = []

list1 = []

a = input()

a = int(a)

b = input('')

list1 = b.split()

list1.sort()

for i in range(a):

list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))

out.append(sum(list2))

del list1[:]

del list2[:]

for outputs in out:

print(outputs)

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t, from input.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the list of 2n integers.

- Sort the list in non-decreasing order.

- Create a list2 containing list1[0], list1[2], ..., list1[2*(n-1)].

- Sum list2 and append the sum to out.

- Clear list1 and list2.

Finally, print all elements in out.

Wait, but in the code, it's summing list2 and appending the sum to out for each test case.

Also, it's clearing list1 and list2 after each test case.

This seems correct.

Wait, but in the n=3, numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3:

list1 after sorting: [1,1,2,2,3,3]

list2: [1,2,3]

Sum: 6

Which matches the expected output.

In n=2, numbers 1,1,2,1:

sorted: [1,1,1,2]

list2: [1,1]

Sum: 2

Which matches the expected output.

In n=1, numbers 2,3:

sorted: [2,3]

list2: [2]

Sum: 2

Which matches the expected output.

So, the program seems to be implementing the correct approach.

But wait, in the code, it's summing list2 for each test case and appending to out.

Then, at the end, it prints all elements in out.

So, it should be printing the correct sums for each test case.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{True} \]
