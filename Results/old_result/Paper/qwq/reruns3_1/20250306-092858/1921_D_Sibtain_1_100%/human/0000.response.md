Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a given list of m integers, where m is at least n. Vasya can choose any n integers from the list of m and arrange them in any order to form his array c. The goal is to maximize the total difference D, which is the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of Petya's array a and Vasya's array c.

Okay, so the problem is to maximize D = sum(|a_i - c_i|) for i from 1 to n.

First, I need to understand what makes D as large as possible. The absolute difference |a_i - c_i| is maximized when c_i is as far away as possible from a_i. So, for each a_i, I should pair it with the c_j that is as far away as possible from it.

But there's a catch: I have to choose n elements from m, and arrange them in a specific order to pair with a_i's. Also, since m >= n, I need to select which n elements to use from the m available.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Let's think about it step by step.

One approach that comes to mind is to sort both arrays and pair the smallest a_i with the largest c_j, and so on, to maximize the differences. Alternatively, pair the largest a_i with the smallest c_j, or maybe mix and match based on which gives a larger difference.

Wait, maybe I should consider both possibilities: pairing small a_i with large c_j, and large a_i with small c_j, and see which one gives a larger D.

Let me consider an example to see what happens.

Take the first example from the input:

n=4, m=6

a = [6,1,2,4]

b = [3,5,1,7,2,3]

So, b is [1,2,3,3,5,7]

If I sort a: [1,2,4,6]

Sort b in reverse: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Then, pair a[1]=1 with c[1]=7: |1-7|=6

a[2]=2 with c[2]=5: |2-5|=3

a[3]=4 with c[3]=3: |4-3|=1

a[4]=6 with c[4]=3: |6-3|=3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13

But in the example, it says the output is 16, which is higher than 13. So, maybe this approach isn't giving the optimal result.

Wait, in the explanation, they chose c = [1,5,7,2], which gives D=5+4+5+2=16.

So, their choice of c is different. They seem to have chosen some elements and arranged them in a particular order to maximize D.

Hmm, perhaps sorting a and c in opposite orders isn't always the best approach.

Let me think differently. Maybe for each a_i, I should choose the c_j that is as far away as possible from a_i, regardless of the order.

But I have to choose n elements from m, so I need to select which c_j's to use.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Another idea: since I can arrange c in any order, the order of c doesn't matter; it's just which c_j's are chosen and paired with which a_i's.

Wait, no, because I can arrange c in any order, meaning I can pair any a_i with any c_j, as long as c_j is one of the m elements chosen.

Actually, since I can arrange c in any order, I can pair a_i with any of the chosen c_j's.

But I need to choose n elements from m and arrange them in any order to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

This seems like an assignment problem, where I need to assign each a_i to a c_j to maximize the sum of differences.

This sounds like it could be solved using some sort of matching algorithm, but that might be too slow for the constraints.

Given that n and m can be up to 2e5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n + m log m) time.

Let me think about sorting the arrays.

If I sort a in ascending order and c in descending order, and pair a_i with c_i, that might give a high sum of differences.

In the first example, sorted a: [1,2,4,6], sorted c descending: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Then, pairing a[1]=1 with c[1]=7: |1-7|=6

a[2]=2 with c[2]=5: |2-5|=3

a[3]=4 with c[3]=3: |4-3|=1

a[4]=6 with c[4]=3: |6-3|=3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13, which is less than the optimal 16.

So, this approach doesn't work in all cases.

Alternatively, maybe sort a and sort c in ascending order, and pair a_i with c_{m+1-i}, meaning pairing a_i with c_j where j is in decreasing order.

In the first example, sorted a: [1,2,4,6], sorted c ascending: [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Then, pair a[1]=1 with c[6]=7: |1-7|=6

a[2]=2 with c[5]=5: |2-5|=3

a[3]=4 with c[4]=3: |4-3|=1

a[4]=6 with c[3]=3: |6-3|=3

Again, D=6+3+1+3=13, same as before.

But in the example, they achieved D=16 by choosing c=[1,5,7,2], which is not sorted in any particular order.

So, perhaps sorting isn't the way to go here.

Wait, maybe I need to consider for each a_i, which c_j to pair with to maximize the difference, without sorting.

But with n and m up to 2e5, that would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the maximum possible D.

If I could choose c_j's such that for each a_i, c_j is as far away from a_i as possible, that would be ideal.

But I have to choose n elements from m, and arrange them in any order.

So, perhaps I should find, for each a_i, the c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|, but I have to do this collectively for all a_i's, considering that each c_j can only be used once.

This sounds like assigning each a_i to a unique c_j to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_j|.

This is similar to the assignment problem in matching theory, but maximizing the sum instead of minimizing it.

I recall that in matching theory, the Hungarian algorithm can solve assignment problems efficiently, but it's for minimizing the sum.

For maximizing the sum, maybe I can negate the differences and use the same algorithm.

But given the constraints, implementing the Hungarian algorithm isn't feasible due to time limits.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the properties of the optimal solution.

Suppose I have a_i's and c_j's sorted.

If I sort a in ascending order and c in descending order, pairing a_i with c_i gives high differences, but as we've seen, it's not always optimal.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the maximum and minimum values in c.

Wait, perhaps for each a_i, I should choose the c_j that is either the largest possible or the smallest possible, depending on which gives a larger difference.

But I have to choose n elements from m, so I need to select which ones to use.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that c has both small and large elements, and a also has small and large elements.

Maybe pairing small a_i with large c_j, and large a_i with small c_j would be a good strategy.

In the first example, a=[6,1,2,4], b=[3,5,1,7,2,3]

If I pair a=6 with c=1, |6-1|=5

a=1 with c=7, |1-7|=6

a=2 with c=3, |2-3|=1

a=4 with c=2, |4-2|=2

Total D=5+6+1+2=14, which is still less than 16.

Wait, in the explanation, they chose c=[1,5,7,2], pairing a=6 with c=1, |6-1|=5

a=1 with c=5, |1-5|=4

a=2 with c=7, |2-7|=5

a=4 with c=2, |4-2|=2

Total D=5+4+5+2=16.

So, in this case, they paired a=6 with c=1, a=1 with c=5, a=2 with c=7, and a=4 with c=2.

This seems to be a mix of pairing small a with large c, and large a with small c, but not strictly.

I need to find a general way to do this.

Let me think about the overall sum D.

D = sum |a_i - c_i| for i=1 to n.

I need to maximize this sum.

To maximize the sum of absolute differences, I need to maximize each individual |a_i - c_i| as much as possible, considering the constraints that c_i's are chosen from b and arranged in any order.

One way to approach this is to consider that for each a_i, the maximum possible |a_i - c_j| is max(|a_i - min(b)|, |a_i - max(b)|).

So, for each a_i, the best possible difference is the maximum difference it can have with any c_j in b.

But since I have to choose n c_j's from m b's, I need to select a combination of c_j's that maximizes the sum of these individual maximum differences.

Wait, but it's not that simple because choosing a particular c_j for one a_i affects which c_j's are available for other a_i's.

This seems like a classic maximum weighted matching problem, where the weights are the differences |a_i - c_j|.

But again, implementing such an algorithm efficiently is challenging given the constraints.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider sorting both a and b.

Sort a in ascending order: a_sorted.

Sort b in ascending order: b_sorted.

Now, to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, I need to arrange c in such a way that the differences are maximized.

One idea is to pair the smallest a_i with the largest b_j, the second smallest a_i with the second largest b_j, and so on.

Wait, but in the first example, that pairing gave me D=13, while the optimal is 16.

So, that might not be the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider pairing a_i with the b_j that is farthest from a_i, considering the available b_j's.

But again, this seems too time-consuming.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a_i and try to choose c_j's to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_j|.

But I need to do this for all a_i's simultaneously.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I can consider the following approach:

Find the maximum and minimum values in b.

Then, for each a_i, choose to pair it with either the maximum or the minimum of b, whichever gives a larger difference.

But I have to choose n elements from m, and arrange them accordingly.

However, this might not always be optimal, as seen in the first example.

Wait, in the first example, a=[6,1,2,4], b=[1,2,3,3,5,7]

For a=6, pairing with b=1 gives |6-1|=5, pairing with b=7 gives |6-7|=1, so choose b=1.

For a=1, pairing with b=7 gives |1-7|=6, pairing with b=1 gives |1-1|=0, so choose b=7.

For a=2, pairing with b=7 gives |2-7|=5, pairing with b=1 gives |2-1|=1, so choose b=7.

But b=7 is already used for a=1, so I have to choose the next best, which is b=5, giving |2-5|=3.

For a=4, pairing with b=5 gives |4-5|=1, pairing with b=1 gives |4-1|=3, so choose b=1.

But b=1 is already used for a=6, so I have to choose the next available, which is b=3, giving |4-3|=1.

So, in this case, pairing a=6 with b=1, a=1 with b=5, a=2 with b=3, a=4 with b=3, giving D=5+4+1+1=11, which is less than 16.

So, this approach isn't giving the optimal result.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider a different strategy.

Let me consider that to maximize the sum of differences, I should try to maximize the individual differences by pairing each a_i with a c_j that is as far away as possible from a_i.

But since I have to choose n elements from m, and arrange them in any order, perhaps I can select the n elements from b that allow for the maximum possible sum of differences.

This seems complex.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as selecting a subset of n elements from b and arranging them in any order to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

This sounds similar to selecting a permutation of n elements from b to maximize the sum of absolute differences with a_i.

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me consider sorting a and b.

Sort a in ascending order: a_sorted.

Sort b in ascending order: b_sorted.

Now, to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, perhaps I can consider pairing the smallest a_i with the largest available b_j, and the largest a_i with the smallest available b_j.

Wait, in the first example, a_sorted=[1,2,4,6], b_sorted=[1,2,3,3,5,7]

Pair a=1 with b=7: |1-7|=6

Pair a=2 with b=5: |2-5|=3

Pair a=4 with b=3: |4-3|=1

Pair a=6 with b=3: |6-3|=3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13, which is less than 16.

But in the optimal solution, they achieved 16 by pairing a=6 with b=1, a=1 with b=5, a=2 with b=7, a=4 with b=2.

So, D=5+4+5+2=16.

Wait, in this pairing, a=6 is paired with b=1, which is the smallest b, and a=1 is paired with b=5, which is neither the smallest nor the largest remaining b.

a=2 is paired with b=7, which is the largest b, and a=4 is paired with b=2, which is relatively small.

So, it seems like pairing a_i with either the smallest or largest available b_j, depending on which gives a larger difference.

But I need to ensure that each b_j is used only once.

This seems like a greedy approach, where for each a_i, I choose the b_j that gives the maximum difference without being already used.

But implementing this directly would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2e5.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the overall sum D.

D = sum |a_i - c_i| for i=1 to n.

I can rewrite this as sum (max(a_i - c_i, c_i - a_i)).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, since I can arrange c in any order, maybe I can think of permuting c to maximize the sum of differences.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look at the problem differently.

Suppose I fix c and compute D for a given c.

I need to choose c as a permutation of n elements from b to maximize D.

This seems too slow.

Wait, maybe I can consider the following:

Find the n elements from b that can maximize the sum of differences when paired with a_i's.

But I need to consider how to pair them.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider the following approach:

Sort a and b.

Then, for a_i, pair it with either the smallest available b_j or the largest available b_j, whichever gives a larger difference.

But I need to keep track of which b_j's are used, which would be too slow.

Wait, maybe I can precompute the maximum possible difference for each a_i by choosing either the smallest or largest b_j, and then select n elements from b that maximize the sum of these differences.

But I need to ensure that the b_j's are unique.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the overall maximum possible D.

If I could choose c_j's to be either the smallest or largest b_j's, depending on a_i, without reusing b_j's, that would be ideal.

But implementing this efficiently is challenging.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I sort b in ascending order.

Then, the possible c_j's are any subset of n elements from b.

I need to arrange them in any order to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

Given that I can arrange c in any order, maybe I can sort a in ascending order and then choose c in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps I can use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of b, and for each a_i, choose the b_j that gives the maximum difference.

But again, I need to ensure that each b_j is used only once.

This seems similar to the earlier idea, which is too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the maximum sum of differences is achieved when c is arranged such that it maximizes the deviation from a.

To maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, I should try to have c_i's that are as different as possible from a_i's.

One way to achieve this is to have c_i's that are either much larger or much smaller than a_i's.

Given that, perhaps selecting c_i's that are the furthest from a_i's is the way to go.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Sort a in ascending order.

2. Sort b in ascending order.

3. Consider two pointers, one at the start (smallest b_j) and one at the end (largest b_j).

4. For each a_i, choose the b_j that gives the maximum difference without being already used.

But again, this seems too slow for the constraints.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me think about the overall sum D.

D = sum |a_i - c_i| for i=1 to n.

I need to maximize this sum.

An alternative way to think about this is to maximize the sum of absolute differences between a_i and c_i.

I recall that in some optimization problems, maximizing the sum of absolute differences can be approached by considering the maximum and minimum values in a certain range.

But here, c_i's are chosen from b, and I need to select n elements from m.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different perspective.

Suppose I fix c as a sorted array, and then pair a_i with c_j in a certain way to maximize the sum of differences.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can consider that for each a_i, I can choose either the smallest or largest available b_j, whichever gives a larger difference, and keep track of used b_j's.

But again, this seems too slow for the constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the following idea:

Compute the sum of the maximum possible differences for each a_i, considering that c_j can be either the minimum or maximum of the remaining b_j's.

But this still requires tracking which b_j's are used, which is too time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the minimum and maximum possible c_i for each a_i and use that to calculate the maximum possible D.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I sort both a and b.

Let me sort a in ascending order: a_sorted.

Sort b in ascending order: b_sorted.

Now, to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, perhaps I can pair a_i with b_j such that c_i is as far away as possible from a_i.

To do this, I can pair a_i with the largest possible b_j that is still far from a_i, or the smallest possible b_j that is far from a_i.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me think about the following approach:

Find the n elements from b that maximize the sum of their distances to a_i's.

But I need to pair them in a way that maximizes the total difference.

This seems too abstract.

Let me consider that the maximum sum D is achieved when c_i's are chosen such that they are as different as possible from a_i's.

To achieve this, perhaps I can select c_i's that are either the smallest or largest possible from b, depending on a_i.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, maybe I can consider splitting b into two parts: the smallest k elements and the largest m - k elements, and choose c_i's from these parts to maximize the differences.

But I need to choose n elements in total.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to look for a different strategy.

Suppose I fix c as the n largest elements from b, sorted in descending order, and pair them with a sorted in ascending order.

Alternatively, pair a sorted in ascending order with c sorted in descending order.

But as we've seen, this doesn't always give the optimal solution.

Wait, in the first example, choosing c=[7,5,3,3], pairing with a=[1,2,4,6], gives D=6+3+1+3=13, which is less than 16.

So, this isn't optimal.

Alternatively, choosing c=[1,2,3,7], pairing with a=[1,2,4,6], gives D=0+0+3+1=4, which is worse.

Wait, in the optimal solution, they chose c=[1,5,7,2], which is not sorted in any particular order.

So, perhaps sorting c isn't the way to go.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider that for each a_i, I can choose the c_j that is either the smallest or largest in b, whichever gives a larger difference, and then remove that c_j from consideration.

But again, this would be too slow for the constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, I should try to have c_i's that are as spread out as possible from a_i's.

Given that, perhaps selecting c_i's from both ends of b (both smallest and largest elements) would be beneficial.

But I need to
