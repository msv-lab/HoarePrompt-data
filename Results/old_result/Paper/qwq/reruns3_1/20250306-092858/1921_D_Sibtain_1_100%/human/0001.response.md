Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a given list of m integers, where m is at least n. Vasya can choose any n integers from the list of m and arrange them in any order to form his array c. The goal is to maximize the total difference D, which is the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of Petya's array a and Vasya's array c.

Okay, so the problem is to select and arrange n integers from m given integers to maximize the sum of absolute differences with another given array of n integers.

First, I need to understand what makes the difference |a_i - c_i| large. The difference is maximized when c_i is as far away as possible from a_i. So, ideally, for each a_i, I want to choose the c_j that is farthest from it.

But there's a catch: I have to choose n integers from m, and arrange them in a specific order corresponding to the elements of a. So, I can't just pair each a_i with the c_j that is farthest from it, because the c's are to be chosen and arranged optimally as a whole.

Hmm. Maybe I should sort both arrays and pair the largest with the smallest or something like that. Let me think.

Suppose I sort array a in ascending order and array c in descending order. Then, for each i, |a_i - c_i| would be maximized because I'm pairing smaller a's with larger c's and larger a's with smaller c's. This might maximize the differences.

Wait, is that correct? Let's take an example.

Suppose a = [1, 2, 3], c = [3, 2, 1]. If I sort a ascendingly as [1, 2, 3] and c descendingly as [3, 2, 1], then the differences are |1-3|=2, |2-2|=0, |3-1|=2, sum is 4.

But if I choose c as [1, 2, 3] and sort it descendingly as [3, 2, 1], same as above.

Alternatively, if I choose c as [1, 2, 3] and arrange it as [3,1,2], then differences are |1-3|=2, |2-1|=1, |3-2|=1, sum is 4 again.

Seems like sorting a ascendingly and c descendingly maximizes the sum.

Wait, but in the second test case in the example, where a = [1,1,1] and c = [1,1,1,1], the maximum difference is 0, which makes sense because all elements are the same.

In the third test case, a = [1,2,3,4,5] and c = [1,2,3,4,5], sorting a ascendingly and c descendingly gives c = [5,4,3,2,1], so differences are |1-5|=4, |2-4|=2, |3-3|=0, |4-2|=2, |5-1|=4, sum is 12, which matches the example.

Seems promising.

Let me try with the first test case.

a = [6,1,2,4], sorted ascendingly as [1,2,4,6]

c = [3,5,1,7,2,3], sorted descendingly as [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Then pair:

1 with 7, difference 6

2 with 5, difference 3

4 with 3, difference 1

6 with 3, difference 3

Sum is 6+3+1+3=13

But in the example, it's 16. Hmm, that's less than 16.

Wait, maybe I need to select only n elements from m, not necessarily the top n.

Maybe I should select the elements from c that are farthest from a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to select the c's that maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

Maybe sorting a and c in different orders isn't always optimal.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps for each a_i, I should choose the c_j that is as far as possible from a_i, either the largest possible or the smallest possible.

But since I have to choose n c's and arrange them, it's like assigning each a_i to a c_j such that the sum of |a_i - c_j| is maximized.

This sounds like an assignment problem where I need to maximize the sum of differences.

In assignment problems, the Hungarian algorithm can be used, but it's for minimizing costs. Here, I want to maximize the sum.

Maybe I can use a similar approach but maximize instead.

But that might be too slow for the constraints, since n can be up to 2e5.

I need a faster approach.

Wait, perhaps matching a_i with the largest possible c_j that hasn't been used yet.

Like, sort a and c, and pair the smallest a with the largest c, the next smallest a with the next largest c, and so on.

Let me try with the first example.

a sorted ascendingly: [1,2,4,6]

c sorted descendingly: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Pair:

1 with 7, difference 6

2 with 5, difference 3

4 with 3, difference 1

6 with 3, difference 3

Sum: 6+3+1+3=13, but the example shows 16.

Hmm, that's less than 16.

Wait, maybe I need to choose different c's.

In the example, they chose (1,5,7,2), which gives differences |6-1|=5, |1-5|=4, |2-7|=5, |4-2|=2, sum=14.

Wait, that's 14, but in the explanation, it says 16. Maybe I misread.

Wait, in the first test case, the output is 16, but with the pairing (1,5,7,2), it's 5+4+5+2=16. So, that matches.

But according to my previous approach, I got 13.

So, perhaps sorting a ascendingly and c descendingly and pairing them directly isn't always optimal.

Maybe I need to select which c's to choose and in what order more carefully.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I fix a_i and try to choose c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|.

But since I have to choose n c's and arrange them, it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe for each a_i, I can find the maximum possible |a_i - c_j|, then sum them up.

But that would be choosing for each a_i, the c_j that is farthest from it, but I can't choose the same c_j for multiple a_i.

So, I need to assign distinct c_j's to a_i's to maximize the sum.

This seems like a maximum weight matching problem, where the weight is |a_i - c_j|.

But again, for large n, this would be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the following:

- Sort array a in ascending order.

- Sort array c in ascending order.

- For each a_i, assign either the smallest available c_j or the largest available c_j, depending on which one gives a larger |a_i - c_j|.

- To implement this efficiently, I can use two pointers: one at the start of c and one at the end.

- For each a_i, choose the c_j that gives the larger difference.

- This way, I'm always choosing the best available option at each step.

Let me try this with the first example.

a sorted: [1,2,4,6]

c sorted: [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Initialize pointers: left=0, right=5

For a[0]=1:

- |1 - 1| = 0

- |1 - 7| = 6

Choose 7, difference=6

Assign c[5]=7 to a[0]=1

For a[1]=2:

- |2 - 2| = 0

- |2 - 5| = 3

Choose 5, difference=3

Assign c[4]=5 to a[1]=2

For a[2]=4:

- |4 - 3| = 1

- |4 - 3| = 1

Choose either, difference=1

Assign c[3]=3 to a[2]=4

For a[3]=6:

- |6 - 2| = 4

- |6 - 3| = 3

Choose 2, difference=4

Assign c[1]=2 to a[3]=6

Sum: 6+3+1+4=14, which matches the example's 16.

Wait, the example has 16, but I got 14. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the example, they chose (1,5,7,2), which is difference 5+4+5+2=16.

But in my approach, I chose (7,5,3,2), difference 6+3+1+4=14.

So, my approach missed out on choosing 5 for a[1]=2 and 7 for a[0]=1, but in my step-by-step, I chose 7 for a[0]=1 and 5 for a[1]=2.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the selection process.

Perhaps instead of assigning the best available c_j at each step, I need to consider the global maximum difference.

Wait, maybe I should sort a and c, and then for each a_i, choose the c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|, ensuring that each c_j is used only once.

But this seems too slow for large n.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort both a and c.

- Initialize two pointers, one at the start of c and one at the end of c.

- For each a_i, choose the c_j that gives the larger difference: either c[left] or c[right].

- Add that difference to the total sum.

- Move the pointer accordingly.

This seems similar to what I did earlier, but in the first example, it gave me 14, while the example shows 16.

Maybe I need to choose the c_j that maximizes the difference for each a_i, but also consider the overall sum.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort a, but keep c sorted in ascending order, and then for each a_i, choose the c_j that is farthest from a_i, considering the current available c's.

But in practice, this is similar to the two-pointer approach.

Wait, maybe I need to sort a in ascending order and c in descending order, and then pair them in a certain way.

Wait, in the first test case, a sorted is [1,2,4,6], c sorted descendingly is [7,5,3,3,2,1].

Pair:

a[0]=1 with c[0]=7, difference=6

a[1]=2 with c[1]=5, difference=3

a[2]=4 with c[2]=3, difference=1

a[3]=6 with c[3]=3, difference=3

Sum=6+3+1+3=13, which is less than 16.

But in the example, they chose c's as [1,5,7,2], which gives 5+4+5+2=16.

Wait, perhaps I need to select c's in a way that doesn't necessarily follow the two-pointer approach strictly.

Maybe I need to consider all possible assignments and pick the one with the maximum sum.

But that's not feasible for large n.

Is there a better way to maximize the sum of absolute differences?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a_i and consider the potential c_j's.

The maximum |a_i - c_j| would be either |a_i - min(c)| or |a_i - max(c)|, whichever is larger.

But since I have to assign distinct c_j's to each a_i, I need to choose c_j's accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through a_i's and at each step, choose the c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|, removing that c_j from the list for future assignments.

But this is essentially what the two-pointer approach does.

Perhaps I need to adjust the way I choose c_j's.

Wait, maybe I should sort a and c, and then for each a_i, choose the c_j from either end that gives the larger difference.

Let me try again with the first example.

a sorted: [1,2,4,6]

c sorted: [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Initialize left=0, right=5

For a[0]=1:

Choose between |1-1|=0 and |1-7|=6, choose 7, sum +=6

Now, right=4

For a[1]=2:

Choose between |2-1|=1 and |2-5|=3, choose 5, sum +=3

Now, right=3

For a[2]=4:

Choose between |4-1|=3 and |4-3|=1, choose 1, sum +=3

Now, left=1

For a[3]=6:

Choose between |6-2|=4 and |6-3|=3, choose 2, sum +=4

Total sum=6+3+3+4=16, which matches the example.

Wait, earlier I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

So, with this approach, I get the correct answer for the first test case.

Let me check another test case.

Third test case:

a = [1,2,3,4,5], c = [1,2,3,4,5]

sorted a: [1,2,3,4,5]

sorted c: [1,2,3,4,5]

left=0, right=4

For a[0]=1:

Choose between |1-1|=0 and |1-5|=4, choose 5, sum +=4

right=3

For a[1]=2:

Choose between |2-1|=1 and |2-4|=2, choose 4, sum +=2

right=2

For a[2]=3:

Choose between |3-1|=2 and |3-3|=0, choose 1, sum +=2

left=1

For a[3]=4:

Choose between |4-2|=2 and |4-3|=1, choose 2, sum +=2

left=2

For a[4]=5:

Choose between |5-3|=2 and no other option, choose 3, sum +=2

Total sum=4+2+2+2+2=12, which matches the example.

Another test case:

Second test case:

a = [1,1,1], c = [1,1,1,1]

sorted a: [1,1,1]

sorted c: [1,1,1,1]

left=0, right=3

For a[0]=1:

Choose between |1-1|=0 and |1-1|=0, choose either, sum +=0

right=2

For a[1]=1:

Choose between |1-1|=0 and |1-1|=0, choose either, sum +=0

right=1

For a[2]=1:

Choose between |1-1|=0 and |1-1|=0, sum +=0

Total sum=0, matches the example.

Seems like this approach works for these cases.

Let me see the provided code and see if it implements this logic.

The code does the following:

- Reads t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads n and m.

- Reads array a of n integers.

- Reads array c of m integers.

- If a has only one unique element and c has only one unique element and they are equal, prints 0.

- Otherwise, sorts a and c in ascending and descending order respectively.

- If n==1, calculates the maximum difference between a[0] and the min or max of c.

- Otherwise, initializes i=0, j=1, ans=0.

- Iterates k from 0 to n-1:

- Computes t1 = |a[i] - c[i]|

- t2 = |a[n-j] - c[m-j]|

- If t2 > t1:

- j +=1

- Else:

- i +=1

- ans += max(t1, t2)

- Prints ans.

Wait, this seems different from what I thought earlier.

In my approach, I sorted a ascendingly and c descendingly, and then for each a_i, chose the c_j that gives the larger difference from either end.

But in the code, after sorting a ascendingly and c descendingly, it has a loop where it compares |a[i] - c[i]| and |a[n-j] - c[m-j]| and chooses the larger one, adjusting i and j accordingly.

This seems a bit different from my initial approach.

Let me try to understand this code with the first test case.

First test case:

a = [6,1,2,4], sorted a=[1,2,4,6]

c = [3,5,1,7,2,3], sorted c descendingly=[7,5,3,3,2,1]

Initialize i=0, j=1, ans=0

Iterate k from 0 to 3:

k=0:

t1 = |1 - 7| = 6

t2 = |4 - 3| =1

Since t2 < t1, choose t1=6, set i=1

ans +=6, ans=6

k=1:

t1 = |2 - 5| =3

t2 = |4 - 3| =1

t2 < t1, choose t1=3, set i=2

ans +=3, ans=9

k=2:

t1 = |4 - 3| =1

t2 = |2 - 2| =0

t2 < t1, choose t1=1, set i=3

ans +=1, ans=10

k=3:

t1 = |6 - 1| =5

t2 = not applicable since j would be 4 and m-j=-1, which is invalid

But in the code, j is incremented only up to m, which is 6.

Wait, m=6, n=4, j=1,2,3,4

k=3:

t1 = |6 - 1| =5

t2 = |6 - 1| =5

Choose max(5,5)=5, ans +=5, ans=15

But in the example, it's 16.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back at the code:

for k in range(len(a)):

t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])

t2 = abs(a[len(a)-j] - c[len(c)-j])

if t2 > t1:

j +=1

else:

i +=1

ans += max(t1, t2)

In this case, len(a)=4, len(c)=6

k=0:

i=0, j=1

t1 = |a[0]-c[0]|=|1-7|=6

t2 = |a[4-1]=a[3]-c[6-1]=c[5]=1|=|6-1|=5

Since t2 < t1, i +=1, i=1

ans +=6, ans=6

k=1:

i=1, j=1

t1=|2-5|=3

t2=|4-1|=3

t2 == t1, but since t2 <= t1, i +=1, i=2

ans +=3, ans=9

k=2:

i=2, j=1

t1=|4-5|=1

t2=|2-1|=1

t2 == t1, i +=1, i=3

ans +=1, ans=10

k=3:

i=3, j=1

t1=|6-7|=1

t2=|6-1|=5

t2 > t1, j +=1, j=2

ans +=5, ans=15

Total sum=15, but the example shows 16.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

So, perhaps this code is not correctly implementing the logic to maximize the sum.

But in the example, it's supposed to output 16, but according to this code, it's 15.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the code.

Looking at the code again:

for k in range(len(a)):

t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])

t2 = abs(a[len(a)-j] - c[len(c)-j])

if t2 > t1:

j +=1

else:

i +=1

ans += max(t1, t2)

In the last iteration, k=3:

i=3, j=1

t1=|6-7|=1

t2=|6-1|=5

Since t2 > t1, j +=1, j=2

Then ans +=5, ans=15

But in reality, we can choose c's as [1,5,7,2], which gives sum=16.

So, the code misses this by choosing c's as [7,5,1,1], sum=6+3+1+5=15.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that c's can have duplicates, and we need to ensure that we don't reuse c_j's.

In the code, it seems to pair a[i] with c[i], but since c is sorted descendingly, and a is sorted ascendingly, it might not always choose the optimal c_j's.

Maybe the code is incorrect in handling duplicates.

Let me check another test case.

Second test case:

a=[1,1,1], c=[1,1,1,1]

sorted a=[1,1,1]

sorted c descendingly=[1,1,1,1]

i=0, j=1

k=0:

t1=|1-1|=0

t2=|1-1|=0

t2 == t1, i +=1, i=1

ans +=0, ans=0

k=1:

i=1, j=1

t1=|1-1|=0

t2=|1-1|=0

t2 == t1, i +=1, i=2

ans +=0, ans=0

k=2:

i=2, j=1

t1=|1-1|=0

t2=|1-1|=0

t2 == t1, i +=1, i=3 (out of range)

But len(a)=3, so k from 0 to 2.

ans +=0, ans=0

Which matches the example.

Third test case:

a=[1,2,3,4,5], c=[1,2,3,4,5]

sorted a=[1,2,3,4,5]

sorted c=[5,4,3,2,1]

i=0, j=1

k=0:

t1=|1-5|=4

t2=|5-1|=4

t2 == t1, i +=1, i=1

ans +=4, ans=4

k=1:

i=1, j=1

t1=|2-4|=2

t2=|4-2|=2

t2 == t1, i +=1, i=2

ans +=2, ans=6

k=2:

i=2, j=1

t1=|3-3|=0

t2=|3-3|=0

t2 == t1, i +=1, i=3

ans +=0, ans=6

k=3:

i=3, j=1

t1=|4-4|=0

t2=|2-1|=1

t2 > t1, j +=1, j=2

ans +=1, ans=7

k=4:

i=3, j=2

t1=|4-3|=1

t2=|2-2|=0

t2 < t1, i +=1, i=4

ans +=1, ans=8

But the example shows 12.

Wait, something's wrong here.

In the example, it's supposed to be 12, but according to this code, it's 8.

This indicates that the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example output, for the third test case, it's 12.

Wait, perhaps I misread the test cases.

Wait, looking back at the example input:

Test case 1:

4 6

6 1 2 4

3 5 1 7 2 3

Output:16

Test case 2:

3 4

1 1 1

1 1 1 1

Output:0

Test case 3:

5 5

1 2 3 4 5

1 2 3 4 5

Output:12

But according to the code, for test case 3, it would output 8, not 12.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the third test case:

a=[1,2,3,4,5], c=[1,2,3,4,5]

sorted a=[1,2,3,4,5]

sorted c descendingly=[5,4,3,2,1]

i=0, j=1

k=0:

t1=|1-5|=4

t2=|5-1|=4

t2 == t1, i +=1, i=1

ans +=4, ans=4

k=1:

i=1, j=1

t1=|2-4|=2

t2=|4-2|=2

t2 == t1, i +=1, i=2

ans +=2, ans=6

k=2:

i=2, j=1

t1=|3-3|=0
