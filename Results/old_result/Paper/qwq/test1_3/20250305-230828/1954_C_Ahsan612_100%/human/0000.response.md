Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, x and y, of the same length, and they're made up of digits from 1 to 9. I can swap the i-th digit of x with the i-th digit of y any number of times, and I need to maximize the product of x and y after performing these swaps.

First, I need to understand what these swaps allow me to do. Since I can swap any digits in the same positions between x and y, it seems like for each position, I can choose which digit goes in x and which goes in y, but only by swapping that specific position.

My goal is to maximize the product of x and y. To maximize the product of two numbers given their digit lengths and the digits themselves, I should aim to make both numbers as large as possible, but considering that their product is what matters.

I recall that for multiplying two numbers, to maximize the product, you generally want to maximize both numbers. But is there a specific way to arrange the digits to achieve this?

Let me think about a simple example. Suppose x = 73 and y = 31. If I swap the second digits, I get x = 71 and y = 33. The product is 71 * 33 = 2343. If I don't swap, x = 73 and y = 31, product is 73 * 31 = 2263. So, swapping improved the product.

Another example: x = 2 and y = 5. If I swap, x = 5 and y = 2, product is 10, which is less than 2 * 5 = 10. So, in this case, it's the same.

Wait, but according to the sample input, for x=2 and y=5, the output is x=5 and y=2. But the product remains the same. The problem says "maximize the product... if there are multiple answers, print any of them." So, in this case, both are valid.

Another sample: x=3516 and y=3982. The output is x=3912 and y=3586. Let's calculate the products:

Original product: 3516 * 3982 = let's see, 3516*4000 = 14064000, minus 3516*18 = 63288, so 14064000 - 63288 = 13999712.

New product: 3912 * 3586. Calculating 3912*3500 = 13692000, plus 3912*86 = let's calculate 3912*100 = 391200, minus 3912*14 = 54768, so 3912*86 = 336432. Total product is 13692000 + 336432 = 14028432.

Comparing 13999712 and 14028432, the new product is indeed larger.

So, the strategy seems to be arranging the digits in such a way that the product is maximized.

But how to do this in general?

I need a systematic approach.

One idea is to consider that for each position, I have two choices: keep the digit in x or swap it with y.

I need to make choices for each position independently, but considering how these choices affect the overall product.

But considering that the numbers can be up to 100 digits, checking all possible combinations is not feasible.

I need a greedy approach or some sort of optimization.

Let me think about the significance of each digit's position.

The leftmost digits are the most significant because they represent higher place values.

So, perhaps I should prioritize making the leftmost digits as large as possible for both x and y.

But wait, if I make one number very large and the other relatively small, their product might not be maximized.

For example, if I have x=91 and y=19, if I swap the first digit, x becomes 11 and y becomes 99. The product is 1079.

Without swapping, x=91 and y=19, product is 1729.

So, in this case, not swapping gives a larger product.

Wait, this contradicts the earlier sample where swapping helped.

So, maybe it's not always better to swap or not to swap.

I need a better strategy.

Perhaps I should look into sorting the digits in some way.

But the constraint is that I can only swap digits in the same positions between x and y.

I can't rearrange the digits within x or y; I can only swap corresponding digits between x and y.

So, for each position, I can decide whether to swap that position or not.

My decision for one position doesn't affect the others, because I can't rearrange within x or y.

Wait, actually, the swaps are independent for each position.

Because each swap only affects the digits in that specific position.

So, for each position, I can choose to swap or not, independently.

Therefore, the problem reduces to, for each position, deciding whether to swap or not, to maximize the product of the two numbers.

But even then, with numbers up to 100 digits, I need an efficient way to make this decision for each position.

I need a rule that tells me, for each position, whether to swap or not.

Let me consider the effect of swapping a particular position.

Suppose, for a given position, I have digits a and b in x and y, respectively.

If I swap, x becomes b and y becomes a in that position.

I need to decide whether swapping increases the product or not.

But since the numbers can be very large, comparing the products directly is not practical.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the product of two numbers.

If I have two numbers x and y, and I swap the i-th digit of both, how does that affect the product?

It's complicated to analyze directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of the difference between the product before and after swapping.

But that seems too involved.

Another idea: since multiplying large numbers is commutative, maybe there's some symmetry I can exploit.

Wait, but I need to maximize x * y.

Let me consider that for each position, I have two choices: swap or not swap.

I need to make choices that collectively maximize the product.

But making choices independently might not lead to the global maximum.

Wait, but since the swaps are position-wise and don't affect each other, maybe I can make local decisions for each position.

Let me consider that for each position, I can choose the arrangement that maximizes the product for that position, assuming the higher positions are already decided.

But I'm not sure.

Perhaps I should look at the digits from the most significant to the least significant.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have already decided the first k digits, and now I'm deciding the (k+1)-th digit.

I need to choose whether to swap or not, based on how it affects the product.

But this seems too time-consuming for large numbers.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the logarithm of the product, since logarithm is a monotonic function.

So, log(x * y) = log(x) + log(y).

To maximize x * y, I need to maximize log(x) + log(y).

But I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the sum of log(x) and log(y).

But calculating log for very large numbers might not be practical in code.

I need a different angle.

Let me think about the numbers digit by digit, considering their place values.

Let’s denote the place values from left to right, with the leftmost being the highest place value.

For each place value, the digit in that position contributes to the number as digit * place_value.

So, x = sum of x_i * place_value_i for i from 0 to n-1.

Similarly for y.

The product x * y would be the sum over all pairs of digits multiplied by their respective place values.

This seems too involved.

Maybe I should look for a pattern or a property that I can exploit.

Let me consider that for each position, I have two choices: keep the digits as they are or swap them.

I need to choose the arrangement that leads to the maximum product.

But with large numbers, comparing the products directly isn't feasible.

I need a way to decide for each position without computing the full product.

Perhaps I can consider the relative sizes of the digits in x and y at each position.

Let me think about the greedy approach.

Suppose I process the digits from the most significant to the least significant.

At each position, I choose the arrangement (swap or not) that maximizes some local criterion.

But what should that criterion be?

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for the most significant digits, I want to maximize x and y individually as much as possible.

But earlier, I saw that just maximizing both might not lead to the maximum product.

Wait, in the first sample, swapping increased the product, even though one number decreased and the other increased.

Wait, no: in the first sample, x decreased from 73 to 71, and y increased from 31 to 33, and the product increased.

So, sometimes decreasing one number and increasing the other can increase the product.

This suggests that it's not just about maximizing both numbers individually.

There must be a balance.

Perhaps I need to maximize the sum of the logarithms of the numbers.

But again, computing logs isn't practical here.

Another idea: perhaps I should sort the digits in x and y in a specific order.

But I can't rearrange within x or y; I can only swap corresponding digits between them.

So, I can't sort individually; I can only choose to swap or not for each position.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of sorting both numbers together in some way.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for each position, I have two choices: keep or swap.

I need to make a choice for each position to maximize the product.

But making all possible combinations is not feasible for large n.

I need a way to make local decisions.

Let me consider the effect of swapping a particular position on the product.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, and I swap the i-th digit.

I need to see how this affects the product.

Let’s denote the place value of the i-th digit as p_i (e.g., for the first digit, p_i is 10^{n-1}, where n is the number of digits).

Before swapping, the contribution to the product from these digits is:

(x_i * p_i + y_i * p_i) = (x_i + y_i) * p_i

After swapping, it becomes:

(y_i * p_i + x_i * p_i) = (x_i + y_i) * p_i

Wait, that's the same.

Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, x = sum over x_i * p_i, y = sum over y_i * p_i.

Product is x * y.

Now, if I swap the i-th digit, x becomes x - x_i * p_i + y_i * p_i, and y becomes y - y_i * p_i + x_i * p_i.

So, new x = x + (y_i - x_i) * p_i

new y = y + (x_i - y_i) * p_i

So, new product = (x + delta) * (y - delta), where delta = (x_i - y_i) * p_i

So, new product = x*y + x*(-delta) + y*delta + delta*(-delta)

= x*y + delta*(y - x) - delta^2

Comparing to original product x*y, the difference is delta*(y - x) - delta^2

I need this difference to be positive to increase the product.

So, delta*(y - x) - delta^2 > 0

Factor delta: delta*(y - x - delta) > 0

So, the sign of this expression depends on the sign of delta and (y - x - delta).

This seems complicated, and I'm not sure how to use this in practice.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

First sample:

Input:

3

73

31

2

5

3516

3982

Output:

71

33

5

2

3912

3586

Wait, in the first pair, 73 and 31 become 71 and 33.

As I calculated earlier, 71*33 = 2343 and 73*31 = 2263, so swapping helps.

In the second pair, 2 and 5 become 5 and 2, product remains 10.

In the third pair, 3516 and 3982 become 3912 and 3586, product increases from 13999712 to 14028432.

So, in the first and third cases, swapping helps, in the second, it doesn't change.

I need to find a general rule.

Let me consider that for each position, I should choose to swap if it increases the product, else not.

But again, I need a way to decide this without computing the full product.

Perhaps I can consider the relative sizes of the digits in x and y at each position.

Wait, maybe I can greedily decide for each position, starting from the most significant digit.

At each position, I choose the arrangement (swap or not) that maximizes the sum of the digits in that position, under some condition.

Wait, but I need to maximize the product, not the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps I should aim to balance the two numbers, so that neither is too small.

But I'm not sure how to formalize that.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I fix all digits except for one position, and try to decide whether to swap that position or not.

Given that, I can see how the product changes based on that single swap.

But even that seems too involved.

Maybe I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that since I can only swap digits in the same position, the relative ordering of digits within x and y is preserved, except for the swaps.

Wait, no, swapping allows me to change the digits in x and y for that position.

Wait, actually, for each position, I can choose independently whether to swap that position or not.

So, for each position, I have two choices: swap or not swap.

I need to make a choice for each position to maximize the product.

But making all possible combinations is not feasible.

I need a way to make local decisions.

Perhaps I can consider that for each position, I should choose the arrangement that maximizes the product for that position, assuming the higher positions are already decided.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following:

At each position, I have two choices:

1. Keep the digits as they are.

2. Swap the digits.

I need to choose the one that leads to a higher product.

But again, comparing the full products is not practical.

Maybe I can look at the ratio of the numbers before and after swapping.

But that seems complicated.

Let me consider that for each position, the swap affects the product by a factor related to the digits in that position.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the ratio of the new digits to the old digits for that position.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, and I can swap their digits position by position.

I need to maximize x * y.

I recall that for two numbers with fixed digit sums, the product is maximized when the numbers are as close to each other as possible.

Wait, but in this problem, the digit sums aren't fixed because swapping changes the digits in x and y.

Wait, no, the digit sums do change because swapping changes which digits are in x and which are in y.

This is confusing.

Maybe I need to think in terms of maximizing the sum of the logarithms of x and y.

But again, computing logs isn't practical here.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I sort the digits in x and y together, and assign the larger digits to x and the smaller ones to y.

But I can't rearrange within x or y; I can only swap corresponding digits.

So, I need to find a way to assign, for each position, which digit goes to x and which to y.

Wait, perhaps I can pair the digits in x and y for each position and decide which one should be in x and which in y to maximize the product.

Let me consider that for each position, I have two choices: have the larger digit in x and the smaller in y, or vice versa.

I need to choose which arrangement gives a better product.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for positions where x has a larger digit than y, I should keep it, and where y has a larger digit, I should swap.

But earlier examples show that it's not always the case.

Wait, in the first sample, x=73 and y=31.

At the first position, x=7 and y=3, x is larger, so keep it.

At the second position, x=3 and y=1, x is larger, so keep it.

But according to the sample, swapping the second position gives a better product.

So, my initial idea is incorrect.

Another idea: perhaps I should swap the digits in positions where swapping would bring larger digits to the higher place values.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that for higher place values, it's more beneficial to have larger digits in both numbers.

So, for the most significant digits, I should choose the larger digit for both x and y.

Wait, but that's not possible since I can only choose one arrangement for each position.

Wait, perhaps I should maximize the sum of the digits in x and y for the higher place values.

But the sum is already fixed for each position since x_i + y_i remains the same regardless of swapping.

Wait, no, if I swap, x_i and y_i change places, but their sum remains the same.

So, the total sum of x and y remains the same regardless of swapping.

But the product x*y can change because x and y change.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference between x and y.

I recall that x*y = ((x+y)/2)^2 - ((x-y)/2)^2.

So, to maximize x*y, I need to minimize (x - y)^2 while maximizing (x + y)^2.

But since (x + y)^2 is fixed for a given sum, minimizing (x - y)^2 maximizes x*y.

Therefore, to maximize x*y, I need to make x and y as close as possible.

So, my goal is to make x and y as equal as possible across all digits.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me verify with the sample input.

First sample: x=71, y=33. Their difference is 71 - 33 = 38.

Original x=73, y=31. Difference is 73 - 31 = 42.

So, by swapping, the difference decreased from 42 to 38, which aligns with the idea of making x and y closer.

Second sample: x=5, y=2. Difference is 3.

If I don't swap, x=2, y=5, difference is 3.

So, same difference.

Third sample: x=3912, y=3586. Difference is 3912 - 3586 = 326.

Original x=3516, y=3982. Difference is 3516 - 3982 = -466.

Absolute difference is 466.

So, by swapping, the difference is reduced from 466 to 326, which again aligns with making x and y closer.

Therefore, it seems that minimizing the difference between x and y leads to maximizing the product.

This makes sense based on the earlier formula x*y = ((x+y)/2)^2 - ((x-y)/2)^2.

To maximize x*y, for a fixed sum, I need to minimize (x - y)^2.

Therefore, I should make x and y as close as possible.

So, my strategy should be to arrange the digits in x and y such that x and y are as close as possible.

Therefore, for each position, I should choose to swap if it helps reduce the difference between x and y.

But how do I do that position by position?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have the current difference between x and y up to the (i-1)-th digit.

Then, for the i-th digit, I need to decide whether to swap or not, to minimize the difference.

But this seems recursive and might be too slow for large n.

Is there a simpler way?

Wait, perhaps I can sort the digits in x and y for each position and decide based on that.

But I can't sort within x or y; I can only swap corresponding digits.

Wait, perhaps I can consider sorting the differences or something.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think of a greedy approach.

Starting from the most significant digit, I should arrange the digits in x and y such that their difference is minimized.

So, for the most significant digit, I should assign the larger digit to the number that is currently smaller, to reduce the difference.

Wait, but I need to consider all digits together.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that for each position, I have two choices: keep or swap.

I need to choose the one that minimizes the difference between x and y.

But again, this seems too involved.

Maybe I can look for a pattern in the sample outputs.

In the first sample, x=73, y=31.

After swapping the second digit, x=71, y=33.

Difference is reduced from 42 to 38.

In the third sample, x=3516, y=3982.

After swapping some digits, x=3912, y=3586.

Difference reduced from 466 to 326.

So, in both cases, swapping helps reduce the difference.

But how to decide which positions to swap?

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for positions where x is larger than y, I should keep it, and for positions where y is larger, I should swap.

But in the first sample, x is larger in both positions, and swapping the second position helps.

Wait, maybe I need to equalize the numbers digit by digit from the most significant to the least significant.

Let me try to formalize this.

Start from the most significant digit.

If x's digit is larger than y's digit, keep it.

If y's digit is larger, swap them.

Then move to the next digit, and repeat.

Let me test this with the first sample.

x=73, y=31.

First digit: x=7, y=3. x is larger, so keep it.

Second digit: x=3, y=1. x is larger, so keep it.

But according to the sample, swapping the second digit gives a better product.

So, my strategy is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should swap when y's digit is larger.

But in the first sample, if I swap the second digit, x becomes 71, y becomes 33.

Difference is reduced, and product increases.

So, perhaps I should swap when y's digit is smaller.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that for each position, I should choose the arrangement that minimizes the difference between x and y up to that position.

So, for the most significant digit, I choose the arrangement that makes x and y as close as possible in that digit.

Then, for the next digit, I adjust accordingly.

This seems like a dynamic approach.

But implementing this for large n might be too slow.

I need a more straightforward approach.

Let me look for another way.

Suppose I pair the digits in x and y for each position and decide whether to swap based on some condition.

If I can find a condition that determines whether to swap or not for each position independently, that would be ideal.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each position, I should assign the larger digit to the number that is currently smaller.

Wait, but I can't rearrange within x or y; I can only swap corresponding digits.

This is confusing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix x and y up to the (i-1)-th digit, and I'm deciding about the i-th digit.

I need to choose whether to swap or not, to minimize the difference between x and y.

Let me denote the difference up to the (i-1)-th digit as diff = x_prefix - y_prefix.

Now, for the i-th digit, I have two choices:

1. Keep the digits: x_i and y_i remain as they are.

Then, the new difference becomes diff + (x_i - y_i)*p_i, where p_i is the place value.

2. Swap the digits: x_i becomes y_i and
