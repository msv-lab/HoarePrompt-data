Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, x and y, of the same length, and they're made up of digits from 1 to 9. I can swap the i-th digit of x with the i-th digit of y any number of times, and I need to maximize the product of x and y after performing these swaps.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what operations I can perform. The numbers can be up to 100 digits long, which means they're really big, but since they're given as strings, I don't have to worry about integer overflow or anything like that.

The operation allowed is swapping the i-th digit of x with the i-th digit of y. I can do this for any i, any number of times. So, essentially, for each position, I can choose to swap or not, independently of the other positions.

My goal is to maximize the product of x and y after these swaps. I need to print the two numbers after the operations, in any order, as long as their product is maximized.

Looking at the example:

Input:

3

73

31

2

5

3516

3982

Output:

71

33

5

2

3912

3586

So, for the first test case, x=73 and y=31. After swapping the second digits, x becomes 71 and y becomes 33. The product is 71*33=2343.

If I didn't swap, x would be 73 and y would be 31, with a product of 2263, which is less than 2343. So, swapping improved the product.

In the second test case, x=2 and y=5. If I swap, x becomes 5 and y becomes 2, with a product of 10. If I don't swap, it's 2*5=10 as well. So, same product.

In the third test case, x=3516 and y=3982. After some swaps, x becomes 3912 and y becomes 3586. Their product is larger than without swapping.

So, I need a general strategy to decide for each digit position whether to swap or not, in order to maximize the product.

One approach could be to greedily decide for each position whether swapping increases the product more than not swapping. But with large numbers, that might not be straightforward.

Another way is to consider that for each digit position, swapping or not is independent of other positions, but I need to consider the overall effect on the product.

Wait, but the numbers have the same length, so I can process them digit by digit.

Let me think about the mathematical impact of swapping a particular digit.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, and I'm looking at the digit in the 10^k place.

Let's denote the digits as a_k and b_k for x and y, respectively.

If I swap them, x becomes x - a_k * 10^k + b_k * 10^k, and y becomes y - b_k * 10^k + a_k * 10^k.

So, the new product is (x + (b_k - a_k)*10^k) * (y + (a_k - b_k)*10^k) = xy + (b_k - a_k)*10^k*(y - x) - (b_k - a_k)^2*(10^k)^2.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the logarithm of the product, since maximizing the product is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the logarithms of the numbers.

But that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should sort the digits of x and y in some way.

Wait, maybe if I sort both numbers' digits and arrange them in a specific order, I can maximize the product.

But sorting alone might not be enough because the order of digits matters in the final numbers.

Another idea: since multiplying larger numbers gives a larger product, I might want to make the higher digits as large as possible in both numbers.

But I need to balance between making both numbers as large as possible.

Wait, perhaps I should sort the digits in each position and assign the larger digits to one number and the smaller ones to the other.

But I need to maximize the product, not necessarily make one number as large as possible and the other as small as possible.

Hmm.

Let's consider a smaller example to get some intuition.

Suppose x=12 and y=34.

If I don't swap, x=12 and y=34, product=408.

If I swap the first digit, x=32 and y=14, product=32*14=448.

If I swap the second digit, x=14 and y=32, product=14*32=448.

If I swap both digits, x=34 and y=12, product=34*12=408.

So, in this case, swapping one digit (either first or second) gives a higher product.

Similarly, in the first example, swapping the second digit gave a higher product.

So, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Another example: x=23, y=45.

Without swapping: 23*45=1035.

Swap first digit: 43*25=1075.

Swap second digit: 25*43=1075.

Swap both digits: 45*23=1035.

Again, swapping one digit gives a higher product.

Wait, is there a general rule here?

It seems that swapping digits where a_i < b_i could be beneficial.

In the first example, a=73, b=31.

First digits: 7 and 3. Since 7 > 3, no need to swap.

Second digits: 3 and 1. Since 3 > 1, no need to swap.

But in the solution, they swapped the second digits.

Wait, but according to the output, x=71 and y=33.

So, they swapped the second digits, making x=71 and y=33.

But according to my earlier logic, since 3 > 1, no swap is needed.

But in this case, swapping increased the product.

So, my initial assumption is wrong.

Perhaps I need to consider the overall impact on the product, not just individual digit comparisons.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, and I can swap their digits at each position independently.

I need to decide for each position whether to swap or not, to maximize the product.

Maybe I can consider that for each position, I should choose the arrangement that maximizes the product for that position, considering the higher positions.

But this seems too vague.

Another approach: Since multiplication is commutative, perhaps I can sort the digits in x and y in a way that their corresponding digits multiply to as much as possible.

Wait, but that might not be directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the sum of the logarithms, but that might not help in this context.

Let me look for a mathematical optimization approach.

Suppose I have two vectors, a and b, representing the digits of x and y, respectively.

I need to permute a and b digit-wise to maximize the product of the two numbers.

Each number is the sum of a_k * 10^k for k from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of digits.

So, the product is sum(a_k * 10^k) * sum(b_j * 10^j).

Expanding this, it's sum_over_k_and_j (a_k * b_j * 10^{k+j}).

I need to maximize this sum.

But since the digits are assigned to specific positions, it's not straightforward to optimize.

Perhaps I can think in terms of greedy algorithms: at each position, make a decision that maximizes some local criterion.

One idea is to greedily maximize the high-order digits in both numbers.

So, for the highest place value, choose the larger digit for the larger number.

But I need to consider the interaction between the two numbers.

Wait, maybe I should sort both lists of digits and pair them in a certain way.

But since I can only swap digits at the same positions, I can't rearrange the digits within a number.

Wait, no, I can only swap digits at the same positions between the two numbers.

So, for each position, I can choose to swap or not, but I can't change the order of digits within x or y.

So, the digits within x and y must stay in their original order, but at each position, I can choose to swap that digit between x and y.

Given that, perhaps I should compare the digits at each position and decide whether to swap based on some criterion.

Let me consider the impact of swapping a particular digit.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, and I'm looking at the i-th digit.

Let a_i be the i-th digit of x, and b_i be the i-th digit of y.

If I swap them, x becomes x - a_i * 10^{n-i} + b_i * 10^{n-i}, and y becomes y - b_i * 10^{n-i} + a_i * 10^{n-i}.

The change in the product is:

New product - Old product = (x + (b_i - a_i)*10^{n-i}) * (y + (a_i - b_i)*10^{n-i}) - x*y

= (x*y + x*(a_i - b_i)*10^{n-i} + y*(b_i - a_i)*10^{n-i} + (a_i - b_i)*(b_i - a_i)*10^{2*(n-i)}) - x*y

= x*(a_i - b_i)*10^{n-i} - y*(a_i - b_i)*10^{n-i} - (a_i - b_i)^2*10^{2*(n-i)}

= (a_i - b_i)*(x - y)*10^{n-i} - (a_i - b_i)^2*10^{2*(n-i)}

= (a_i - b_i)*(x - y - (a_i - b_i)*10^{n-i})*10^{n-i}

This seems complicated, and it's not clear when this change is positive or negative.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that for each position, I can choose to swap or not, and I need to make a decision that maximizes the overall product.

Perhaps I can consider the following:

- For positions where a_i > b_i, leaving them as is contributes more to the product.

- For positions where a_i < b_i, swapping them would make both numbers larger in that position.

But this seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps I should think about maximizing the sum of the digits in each position, considering the place value.

But I need to maximize the product, not the sum.

Another idea: Since x and y are being multiplied, perhaps I should aim to make both x and y as large as possible in terms of their numerical values.

But I need to consider how swapping digits at certain positions affects the overall values.

This is tricky.

Let me consider another approach: Since I can swap digits at the same positions, I can think of assigning the larger digit to the number that would benefit more from having it.

But again, it's not clear how to determine which number would benefit more.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of which number is smaller and needs a boost.

But that might not be accurate.

Let me try to think of an example where swapping certain digits increases the product.

Take x=123 and y=321.

Without swapping, product is 123*321=39483.

If I swap the first digit, x=323 and y=121, product=323*121=39183, which is less.

If I swap the second digit, x=123 and y=321, same as original.

If I swap the third digit, x=121 and y=323, product=121*323=39083, less than original.

So, in this case, no swapping increases the product.

Another example: x=13, y=24.

Without swapping: 13*24=312.

Swap first digit: 23*14=322.

Swap second digit: 14*23=322.

Swap both digits: 24*13=312.

So, swapping one digit increases the product.

Similarly, in the first example, swapping the second digit increased the product.

So, perhaps the rule is to swap digits where a_i < b_i.

But in the x=123, y=321 example, a_1=1 < b_1=3, so swap first digit; a_2=2 < b_2=2, no swap; a_3=3 > b_3=1, no swap.

Following this rule, swap only the first digit, which decreases the product in this case.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

So, maybe this rule isn't correct.

Perhaps I need to consider the impact on the overall product.

Another idea: To maximize x*y, I can try to make x and y as close as possible, since the product is maximized when the two numbers are equal.

But in this problem, since I can only swap digits at the same positions, I might not be able to make them equal, but I can try to make them as balanced as possible.

So, for each position, I can choose to swap if it helps balance the two numbers.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me consider that for each position, I can choose to assign the larger digit to the number that is currently smaller.

Wait, but I need to consider the overall values, not just the current state.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can think of it as assigning the larger digits to the higher place values in both numbers.

So, for each position, I can choose to assign the larger digit to the higher place in both numbers.

Wait, but I can't rearrange the digits within a number; I can only swap digits at the same positions between the two numbers.

So, for each position, I can decide to swap or not, based on which assignment gives a higher product.

But how do I decide that?

Let me consider that for each position, I can choose to have the larger digit in that position for one number and the smaller for the other.

But which one to choose?

Wait, perhaps I can sort the digits in each position and assign the larger digit to the position with higher place value.

But I need to maximize the product, not necessarily the sum.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider that for each position, I can choose to swap or not, and I can make a decision based on which choice gives a higher product.

But with multiple digits, this would be time-consuming, especially since the numbers can have up to 100 digits.

I need a more efficient approach.

Perhaps I can consider that for each position, swapping when a_i < b_i increases the sum of x and y, which in turn could increase the product.

But earlier examples show that this isn't always the case.

Wait, in the first example, swapping the second digit when a_i=3 and b_i=1 increased the product.

In the x=123 and y=321 example, swapping the first digit when a_i=1 and b_i=3 decreased the product.

So, my initial thought is incomplete.

Maybe I need to consider the difference in place values.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for higher place values, I should avoid swapping if possible, and only swap for lower place values.

But that doesn't seem consistent with the examples.

Another idea: perhaps I should sort the positions based on the potential increase in product from swapping.

But that might be too time-consuming.

Let me think about the mathematical impact again.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, and I'm looking at one digit position.

Let’s denote:

x = x' + a_i * 10^k + x''

y = y' + b_i * 10^k + y''

Where x' and y' are the higher digits, and x'' and y'' are the lower digits.

If I swap a_i and b_i, then:

x_new = x' + b_i * 10^k + x''

y_new = y' + a_i * 10^k + y''

The difference in the product is:

(x_new * y_new) - (x * y) = (x' + b_i * 10^k + x'') * (y' + a_i * 10^k + y'') - (x' + a_i * 10^k + x'') * (y' + b_i * 10^k + y'')

Expanding both terms:

= x'y' + x'y'' + x''y' + x''y'' + b_i * 10^k * y' + b_i * 10^k * y'' + a_i * 10^k * x' + a_i * 10^k * x'' + a_i * b_i * (10^k)^2

- (x'y' + x'y'' + x''y' + x''y'' + a_i * 10^k * y' + a_i * 10^k * y'' + b_i * 10^k * x' + b_i * 10^k * x'' + a_i * b_i * (10^k)^2)

Simplifying:

= b_i * 10^k * y' + b_i * 10^k * y'' + a_i * 10^k * x' + a_i * 10^k * x'' - a_i * 10^k * y' - a_i * 10^k * y'' - b_i * 10^k * x' - b_i * 10^k * x''

= 10^k * [ b_i * (y' + y'' - x' - x'') + a_i * (x' + x'' - y' - y'') ]

= 10^k * ( b_i - a_i ) * ( y' + y'' - x' - x'' )

So, the difference in the product is:

10^k * ( b_i - a_i ) * ( y - y'' - x + x'' )

Wait, this seems off.

Wait, y = y' + b_i * 10^k + y''

So, y - y'' = y' + b_i * 10^k

Similarly, x - x'' = x' + a_i * 10^k

So, y - y'' - x + x'' = (y' + b_i * 10^k) - (x' + a_i * 10^k) = (y' - x') + (b_i - a_i) * 10^k

So, the difference becomes:

10^k * ( b_i - a_i ) * [ (y' - x') + (b_i - a_i) * 10^k ]

This still seems complicated.

Perhaps I need to consider that if y' > x', then swapping when b_i > a_i increases the product, or something like that.

This is getting too tangled.

Maybe I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that the product x*y can be expressed as sum over all pairs of digits a_i and b_j, a_i * b_j * 10^{i+j}.

But again, not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can think about maximizing the sum of a_i * b_i for each position.

Because in the product, each pair of digits a_i and b_j contributes a_i * b_j * 10^{i+j}.

But since I can only swap digits at the same positions, I can only affect the products where i=j.

Wait, but in the total product, there are terms for all i and j, not just i=j.

However, maybe I can focus on maximizing the sum of a_i * b_i for each position, weighted by 10^{2k} for each position k.

Because for each position k, the cross terms are a_k * b_k * 10^{2k}, and the interaction with other positions is more complex.

So, perhaps as a heuristic, I can try to maximize sum over k of a_k * b_k * 10^{2k}.

This would involve assigning higher digits to higher positions where possible.

But I'm not sure if this is the best approach.

Another idea: perhaps I can sort the digits in x and y separately and pair them in a certain way.

But again, since I can only swap at the same positions, I can't rearrange the digits within x and y.

Wait, but I can choose to swap or not for each position independently.

So, for each position, I can choose the pair (a_i, b_i) or (b_i, a_i).

I need to choose for each position which pair to use, to maximize the product.

This sounds like a greedy algorithm where I make the best choice for each position, considering the overall impact.

But I need a way to decide for each position whether swapping is better or not.

Let me consider that for higher positions (higher place values), it's more crucial to have higher digits in both numbers.

So, for higher place values, I should try to have higher digits in both x and y.

But since I can only swap at each position independently, I need to decide whether swapping at that position would help in making both numbers larger.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the product increase from swapping versus not swapping for each position.

But calculating that for each position separately seems inefficient.

Is there a pattern or a rule that I can follow?

Let me consider that for positions where a_i > b_i, I should not swap, because making x and y have higher digits in that position without swapping is better.

For positions where a_i < b_i, I should swap, to make x and y have higher digits in that position.

But earlier examples show that this isn't always the case.

Wait, in the first example, a=73, b=31.

First position: a1=7, b1=3 → a1 > b1, don't swap.

Second position: a2=3, b2=1 → a2 > b2, don't swap.

But according to the solution, swapping the second position increases the product.

So, my assumption is wrong.

Another example: x=2, y=5.

If I swap, x=5, y=2, product=10; without swapping, product=10. Same.

Third example: x=3516, y=3982.

Solution swaps some digits to get x=3912, y=3586.

So, perhaps the rule is to swap positions where a_i < b_i, but only if it increases the product.

But I need a general rule.

Let me consider that for positions where a_i != b_i, I should swap if it increases the sum of x and y, and the difference between x and y is minimized.

But that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the difference between x and y.

If x and y are close in value, their product is larger.

So, I should try to make x and y as close as possible.

Therefore, for each position, I should choose to swap or not based on which choice makes x and y closer.

But I need to verify this.
