Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in late and stands at the end, which is position n. But he doesn't want to wait too long, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue. To do that, he can bribe people in front of him to swap places, but it costs him some coins, and there are also costs associated with passing people when he swaps.

First, I need to understand the setup. The queue starts with person 1 at the front, up to person n at the back, where Kirill is standing. So, his initial position is n.

Now, he can choose to swap with someone ahead of him, but not beyond his current position. Specifically, if he's at position i, he can choose any j < i and swap with the person at position j, but he has to pay a_j coins to that person, and for everyone between j and i, he has to pay b_k coins to each of them.

He can do this any number of times, and he wants to minimize the total coins he spends, but end up in one of the first m positions.

Okay, so I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position from 1 to m.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to think about this is to model it as a graph where each position in the queue is a node, and there are edges between positions representing the cost to swap from one position to another.

But considering the constraints and the operations allowed, maybe there's a smarter way to do this.

Let's consider that Kirill starts at position n, and he wants to reach position m or less.

He can perform swaps with anyone ahead of him, paying certain costs.

I need to find the sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

Hmm.

Maybe I can think of this as a path in a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent possible swaps with their associated costs.

But with n up to 200,000, building a graph with that many nodes isn't feasible due to time and space constraints.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to move from position n down to some position k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ m.

He can do this by swapping with people in front of him, paying the respective costs.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

Maybe I can consider the cost to move directly from n to k, considering the costs involved in swapping and passing through intermediate positions.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a smaller example to get some intuition.

Take the first sample input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2.

Kirill starts at position 4, and he wants to be in position 1 or 2.

He can swap with position 3, paying a_3=6, and also pay b_3=8 (since he's passing position 3).

Wait, no, the problem says that if he swaps with j, he pays a_j to j, and for each k between j and i, he pays b_k.

Wait, in this case, if he swaps with position 3, then k=3 and i=4, so he pays a_3=6 and for k=3 (since j < k < i, which is k=3), he pays b_3=8.

So total cost for this swap would be 6 + 8 = 14.

After this swap, he is now at position 3.

Now, from position 3, he can try to swap with position 2 or 1.

If he swaps with position 2, paying a_2=3, and paying b_2=3 (since k=2 < i=3), total cost for this swap is 3 + 3 = 6.

So, cumulative cost is 14 + 6 = 20.

Now, he's at position 2, which is within the desired positions.

Alternatively, from position 4, he could try to swap directly with position 2.

In that case, j=2, i=4.

He pays a_2=3, and for k=2 and 3 (since j < k < i), he pays b_2=3 and b_3=8, so total cost is 3 + 3 + 8 = 14.

Then he's at position 2.

Similarly, he could try to swap directly with position 1.

j=1, i=4.

Pays a_1=7, and for k=1,2,3, pays b_1=4, b_2=3, b_3=8, total cost 7 + 4 + 3 + 8 = 22.

So, the minimal among these options is swapping directly to position 2 with a cost of 14.

Hence, the answer for the first test case is 14.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, I need a general approach that can handle up to 200,000 people efficiently.

Let me try to generalize from this example.

Kirill starts at position n and wants to reach position m or less.

He can perform swaps, each swap has a cost based on the person he's swapping with and the people in between.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

One idea is to consider the cost of moving from position n down to each possible position k from 1 to m, and then take the minimum among these costs.

But calculating this directly would be too slow for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the costs involved.

If Kirill wants to move from position i to position j (j < i), the cost is a_j plus the sum of b_k for j < k < i.

Wait, more precisely, for j < k < i.

So, for example, if i=4 and j=2, then k=3, so sum of b_3.

If i=4 and j=1, then k=2 and 3, so sum of b_2 and b_3.

Similarly, if i=3 and j=2, then k=2, so sum of b_2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says for each k such that j < k < i, pay b_k to the person at position k.

Wait, but in the first sample, when swapping from 4 to 3, k=3, so pay b_3=8.

Then, swapping from 3 to 2, k=2, so pay b_2=3.

But in the direct swap from 4 to 2, k=2 and 3, pay b_2=3 and b_3=8.

Wait, but in the first case, swapping from 4 to 3 costs a_3=6 + b_3=8 = 14, then from 3 to 2 costs a_2=3 + b_2=3 = 6, total 20.

Direct swap from 4 to 2 costs a_2=3 + b_2=3 + b_3=8 = 14.

So, direct swap is cheaper.

Similarly, swapping from 4 to 1 costs a_1=7 + b_1=4 + b_2=3 + b_3=8 = 22, which is more expensive than the direct swap to 2.

Hence, the minimal cost is 14.

So, perhaps it's better to consider direct swaps to the desired positions and also consider sequences of swaps to see if that gives a better cost.

But for large n, this needs to be efficient.

Maybe I can use dynamic programming or some greedy approach.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

Let dp[k] be the minimal cost to reach position k, where k ranges from 1 to m.

I need to compute dp[k] for each k from 1 to m, and then take the minimum among them.

Now, to compute dp[k], I can consider all possible ways to reach position k.

One way is to swap directly from position n to k, which costs a_k + sum of b_j for k < j < n.

Wait, more precisely, for j < k < i, pay b_k for each k between j and i.

Wait, in the problem statement, when swapping from i to j (j < i), pay a_j and for each k such that j < k < i, pay b_k.

So, for swapping from n to k, pay a_k + sum of b_{k+1} to b_{n-1}.

Wait, positions are from 1 to n, and k is from 1 to m.

Wait, in the first sample, n=4, m=2.

Swapping from 4 to 2: pay a_2=3 + b_3=8 + b_2=3, but wait, b_k is for k between j and i, which is k=2 and 3.

Wait, but in the problem, b_k is for each k such that j < k < i.

So, in this case, j=2, i=4, so k=3, paying b_3=8.

Wait, but in the first sample, when swapping from 4 to 2, it's a_2=3 + b_3=8.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's j < k < i, so k=3.

Wait, perhaps I misread the positions.

Let me double-check.

Given that the queue is 1 to n, and Kirill is at n.

When swapping with j, j < i, and paying a_j, and for each k where j < k < i, paying b_k.

So, in the first sample, n=4, m=2.

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Swapping from 4 to 3: pay a_3=6 and b_3=8, total 14.

Then, from 3 to 2: pay a_2=3 and b_2=3, total 6.

Total cost: 14 + 6 = 20.

Alternatively, swapping directly from 4 to 2: pay a_2=3 and b_3=8, total 11.

Wait, but in the sample, it's 3 + 8 = 11, but in the explanation, it's 3 + 3 + 8 = 14.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the problem statement, when swapping from i to j (j < i), you pay a_j and for each k where j < k < i, pay b_k.

So, from i=4 to j=2, pay a_2=3 and for k=3, pay b_3=8.

Total: 3 + 8 = 11.

But in the sample, it's 14.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the first sample, the output is 14.

But according to the problem, swapping from 4 to 2 should cost a_2=3 + b_3=8 = 11.

But the sample output is 14.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j . In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k . Kirill can perform this action any number of times."

Wait, so when swapping from i to j, pay a_j and for each k where j < k < i, pay b_k.

In the first sample, swapping from 4 to 2: pay a_2=3 and b_3=8, total 11.

But the sample output is 14.

So, perhaps I need to consider that after swapping, Kirill is now at position j, and he might have to perform more swaps from there.

Wait, in the first sample explanation, perhaps swapping from 4 to 3 costs 6 + 8 = 14, then from 3 to 2 costs 3 + 3 = 6, total 20, but directly from 4 to 2 costs 3 + 8 = 11, but the sample output is 14.

Wait, maybe there's something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when swapping from 4 to 2, he pays a_2=3 and b_3=8, total 11, and then he's at position 2, which is within m=2, so that's acceptable.

But why is the sample output 14?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after swapping, the queue changes, but the indices remain the same.

Wait, no, the indices are fixed based on initial positions.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when Kirill swaps with j, he takes j's position, and j takes his position, but the problem might be considering the positions fixed.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me look at the problem again.

"Kirill is standing at position n+1, but in the input, it's given that he's after the n-th person, so position n+1.

But in the code, it's na_frente = n, and pos_final = m.

Wait, in the code, na_frente is reduced by 1, so na_frente = n-1, and pos_final = m-1.

Wait, perhaps the positions are 0-based in the code.

Wait, in the problem, positions are 1-based.

Wait, in the code, positions seem to be 0-based.

Wait, in the code, v ranges from na_frente down to 0.

Given that na_frente = n-1, and pos_final = m-1.

So, positions are 0 to n-1, with Kirill starting at position n.

Wait, but in the code, it seems to handle positions from 0 to n-1.

Wait, perhaps the code is considering positions from 0 to n, with Kirill starting at n.

But in the code, na_frente is set to n-1, which seems to be the position before Kirill.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of positions as 0 to n, with Kirill starting at n.

Then, na_frente = n-1, which is the position just before Kirill.

And pos_final = m-1, since positions are 0-based.

Okay, perhaps that's the approach in the code.

Now, in the code, there's a loop from na_frente down to 0.

For each position v, if v <= pos_final, it checks if the current total plus a[v] is less than the current best, and updates best accordingly.

Also, it decides whether to add a[v] or b[v] to the total, depending on which is smaller.

Wait, but in the problem, when swapping from i to j, you pay a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

In the code, it seems to be considering positions from n-1 down to 0, and deciding whether to swap with position j or to pass through by paying b_k.

Wait, perhaps the code is simulating moving from position n down to position 0, deciding at each step whether to swap with the person at position v or to pay b_v to pass.

And keeping track of the total cost, and when reaching a position within m, keeping track of the minimal cost to reach that position.

In the loop, for v from n-1 down to 0:

- If v <= pos_final, meaning it's within the desired positions, then:

- Update the best cost if total + a[v] is less than current best.

- Decide whether to add a[v] or b[v] to the total, depending on which is smaller.

- Else, just add the smaller of a[v] or b[v] to the total.

Finally, output the best cost found.

Wait, but in the first sample, n=4, m=2, so na_frente=3, pos_final=1.

Loop from v=3 down to 0:

- v=3:

- v > pos_final (1), so add min(a[3]=9, b[3]=5)=5 to total.

total=5

- v=2:

- v > pos_final, add min(a[2]=6, b[2]=8)=6 to total.

total=11

- v=1:

- v <= pos_final, so if total + a[1]=3 < best=1e12, set best=14.

Then, decide whether to add a[1]=3 or b[1]=4 to total.

Since 3 < 4, add 3 to total.

total=14

- v=0:

- v <= pos_final, so if total + a[0]=7 < best=14, no, since 14 +7=21 >14.

Then, add min(a[0]=7, b[0]=4)=4 to total.

total=18

Finally, best=14.

Which matches the sample output.

Okay, so the code seems to be implementing this logic.

Now, I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let's see.

The idea is to iterate from the back (position n-1) to the front (position 0), keeping track of the total cost accumulated so far.

When we reach a position that is within the desired positions (v <= pos_final), we check if the total cost plus the cost to swap with that position is less than the current best, and update the best accordingly.

Then, we decide whether to add a[v] or b[v] to the total, depending on which is smaller.

For positions outside the desired range, we just add the smaller of a[v] or b[v] to the total.

Finally, the best cost found is the answer.

Is this correct?

Let's think about it.

In the first sample, the process is:

- v=3: total += 5 (min(a[3]=9, b[3]=5))

- v=2: total += 6 (min(a[2]=6, b[2]=8))

- v=1: total +=3 (since a[1]=3 < b[1]=4)

- At v=1, check if total + a[1]=14 < best=1e12, set best=14.

- v=0: total +=4 (min(a[0]=7, b[0]=4))

- At v=0, total + a[0]=18, which is greater than best=14, so no update.

Hence, best=14.

This matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

2 1

2 3

1 1

n=2, m=1

na_frente=1, pos_final=0

Loop:

- v=1: v > pos_final, add min(a[1]=3, b[1]=1)=1 to total. total=1

- v=0: v <= pos_final, check if total + a[0]=2 +1=3 < best=1e12, set best=3.

Then, add min(a[0]=2, b[0]=1)=1 to total. total=2

Hence, best=3.

Which matches the last sample output.

Seems correct.

Another sample input:

7 7

7 2 9 2 6 5 9

9 1 10 7 1 4 9

n=7, m=7, so na_frente=6, pos_final=6

Loop:

- v=6: v > pos_final? No, v=6 == pos_final=6, so check if total + a[6]=9 < best=1e12, set best=9.

Then, add min(a[6]=9, b[6]=9)=9 to total. total=9

- v=5: v > pos_final? No, v=5 < pos_final=6, so check if total + a[5]=5 +9=14 < best=9? No.

Add min(a[5]=5, b[5]=4)=4 to total. total=13

- v=4: v > pos_final? No, v=4 < pos_final=6, check if total + a[4]=6 +13=19 < best=9? No.

Add min(a[4]=6, b[4]=1)=1 to total. total=14

- v=3: v > pos_final? No, v=3 < pos_final=6, check if total + a[3]=2 +14=16 < best=9? No.

Add min(a[3]=2, b[3]=7)=2 to total. total=16

- v=2: v > pos_final? No, v=2 < pos_final=6, check if total + a[2]=9 +16=25 < best=9? No.

Add min(a[2]=9, b[2]=10)=9 to total. total=25

- v=1: v > pos_final? No, v=1 < pos_final=6, check if total + a[1]=2 +25=27 < best=9? No.

Add min(a[1]=2, b[1]=1)=1 to total. total=26

- v=0: v > pos_final? No, v=0 < pos_final=6, check if total + a[0]=7 +26=33 < best=9? No.

Add min(a[0]=7, b[0]=9)=7 to total. total=33

Hence, best=9.

Which matches the third sample output.

Seems correct.

Another sample input:

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

n=6, m=2, na_frente=5, pos_final=1

Loop:

- v=5: v > pos_final, add min(a[5]=3, b[5]=1)=1 to total. total=1

- v=4: v > pos_final, add min(a[4]=8, b[4]=4)=4 to total. total=5

- v=3: v > pos_final, add min(a[3]=1, b[3]=1)=1 to total. total=6

- v=2: v > pos_final, add min(a[2]=7, b[2]=8)=7 to total. total=13

- v=1: v <= pos_final, check if total + a[1]=13 +9=22 < best=1e12, set best=22.

Then, add min(a[1]=9, b[1]=8)=8 to total. total=21

- v=0: v <= pos_final, check if total + a[0]=21 +6=27 < best=22? No.

Add min(a[0]=6, b[0]=5)=5 to total. total=26

Hence, best=22.

Which matches the second sample output.

Seems correct.

So, the code seems to be implementing the correct logic and producing the correct outputs for the sample inputs.

Therefore, I would say that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
