Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have two firework launchers: one launches every 'a' minutes, and the other every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after launch. I need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible.

Let's consider the first launcher:

- It launches at time a, 2a, 3a, and so on.

Similarly, the second launcher:

- It launches at time b, 2b, 3b, and so on.

Each firework is visible from the launch time up to launch time plus m minutes, inclusive.

So, for a firework launched at time t, it's visible at times t, t+1, ..., t+m.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of these fireworks are visible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to find a time when the overlapping of the visibility periods is maximum.

I need to consider the launch times and their visibility periods.

Let me consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, because that's when both launchers launch at the same time.

But wait, if they launch at the same time, their fireworks will be visible together.

But I need to consider the visibility periods, not just the launch times.

Wait, no, their visibility periods overlap based on their launch times.

I need to find a time where the number of visibility periods overlapping is maximized.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a time t, and count how many fireworks are visible at that time.

For the first launcher, the fireworks launched at times that are multiples of a, and their visibility periods are [ka, ka + m], for k = 1,2,3,...

Similarly, for the second launcher, [lb, lb + m], for l = 1,2,3,...

I need to find t such that the number of ka where ka <= t < ka + m +1, and similarly for lb.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a smarter way.

Looking at the example:

Input:

6

6 7 4

3 4 10

7 8 56

5 6 78123459896

1 1 1

1 1 1000000000000000000

Output:

2

7

17

28645268630

4

2000000000000000002

In the first case, a=6, b=7, m=4.

So, fireworks from the first launcher are visible every 6 minutes for 5 minutes.

Similarly, second launcher every 7 minutes for 5 minutes.

At time t=7:

- First launcher: no firework visible yet.

- Second launcher: firework launched at t=7, visible from 7 to 11.

At t=6:

- First launcher: firework launched at t=6, visible from 6 to 10.

- Second launcher: no firework visible yet.

At t=12:

- First launcher: firework at t=6 (visible until t=10), and t=12 (visible from 12 to 16).

- Second launcher: firework at t=7 (visible until t=11), and t=14 (visible from 14 to 18).

So at t=12, fireworks from the first launcher at t=6 and t=12 are visible, but t=6 is only visible up to t=10, so at t=12, only the t=12 firework is visible from the first launcher.

Similarly, t=7 is visible until t=11, so at t=12, it's not visible.

t=14 is launched at t=14, visible until t=18.

So at t=12, only one from each launcher is visible.

Hence, total of 2 fireworks, which matches the first output.

Wait, but according to the code, it's printing mn // a + mn // b +1 in some cases.

Wait, let's look at the code.

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())

mn = min(a, b) + m

if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):

print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)

else:

print(mn // a + mn // b)

So, it calculates mn = min(a, b) + m

Then, if m is divisible by both a and b (and a and b are not 1), it prints mn//a + mn//b +1

Else, just mn//a + mn//b

In the first example:

a=6, b=7, m=4

mn = min(6,7) +4 =6+4=10

m%6=4%6=4 !=0

So, it prints 10//6 + 10//7 =1 +1=2, which matches the output.

In the second example:

a=3, b=4, m=10

mn =3+10=13

m%3=1 !=0

So, 13//3 +13//4=4+3=7, which matches.

Third example:

a=7, b=8, m=56

mn=7+56=63

m%7=0, m%8=0, but a!=1 and b!=1

So, 63//7 +63//8 +1=9 +7=16 +1=17, which matches.

Fourth example:

a=5, b=6, m=78123459896

mn=5+78123459896=78123459901

m%5=1, m%6=4

So, 78123459901//5 +78123459901//6=15624691980 +13020576650=28645268630, which matches.

Fifth example:

a=1, b=1, m=1

mn=1+1=2

m%1=0, but a=1, so print 2//1 +2//1=2+2=4, which matches.

Sixth example:

a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000

mn=1+1000000000000000000=1000000000000000001

m%1=0, but a=1, so print 1000000000000000001//1 +1000000000000000001//1=2000000000000000002, which matches.

So, the code seems to be correct, as it matches all the sample outputs.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct in general.

Let's try to understand the logic.

mn = min(a, b) + m

This seems to be choosing a time t = min(a, b) + m.

Then, it calculates how many fireworks from each launcher are visible at this time.

For the first launcher, the number of fireworks visible at time t is floor(t / a), because it launches at a, 2a, 3a, etc., and each firework is visible up to a + m, 2a + m, etc.

Wait, no.

Actually, for the first launcher, a firework launched at ka is visible up to ka + m.

So, at time t, the number of fireworks visible is the number of ka such that ka <= t < ka + m +1.

Which is floor((t)/(a)) if t >= ka and t < ka + m +1.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many fireworks are active at time t.

For the first launcher, the number of active fireworks at time t is floor((t)/(a)) if t >= ka and t < ka + m +1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for the first launcher, the number of fireworks launched up to time t is floor(t / a).

Each firework is visible for m +1 minutes.

So, the number of fireworks still visible at time t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a).

Similarly for the second launcher.

Wait, that makes more sense.

So, for the first launcher:

number of active fireworks = floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

Similarly for the second launcher.

Then, the total number of active fireworks is the sum of the two, minus any overlaps if they launch at the same time.

But, if a and b are co-prime, there might be no overlaps.

Wait, but if a and b have a common multiple, there might be overlapping launches.

But this seems too complicated.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be using mn = min(a, b) + m, then calculating mn // a + mn // b, and in some cases adding +1.

I need to understand why.

Perhaps the maximum number of visible fireworks occurs at time t = min(a, b) + m.

At this time, for the first launcher, the number of active fireworks is floor(t / a), and for the second is floor(t / b).

But, I need to verify if this is indeed the time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose a=2, b=3, m=3.

So, mn = min(2,3) +3=2+3=5

Then, mn//a + mn//b =5//2 +5//3=2 +1=3

But, let's see:

At t=5:

First launcher: fireworks at t=2,4,6.

At t=5:

- t=2 is visible from 2 to 5.

- t=4 is visible from 4 to 7.

- t=6 is visible from 6 to 9.

So, at t=5, fireworks from t=2 and t=4 are visible. So, 2 from the first launcher.

Second launcher: fireworks at t=3,6.

At t=5:

- t=3 is visible from 3 to 6.

- t=6 is visible from 6 to 9.

So, at t=5, t=3 is visible.

Hence, total fireworks at t=5: 2 from first +1 from second=3, which matches.

Is there a time where more than 3 are visible?

At t=6:

First launcher: t=2,4,6 are visible from 2-5, 4-7, 6-9.

At t=6: t=4 and t=6 are visible.

Second launcher: t=3,6 are visible from 3-6,6-9.

At t=6: t=3 and t=6 are visible.

So, total: 2 from first +2 from second=4.

Wait, but according to the code, it would calculate mn=min(2,3)+3=2+3=5, then 5//2 +5//3=2+1=3.

But at t=6, we have 4 fireworks visible.

So, in this case, the code would output 3, but actually, at t=6, there are 4 fireworks visible.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, it seems correct.

Wait, but in this example, a=2, b=3, m=3.

t=6:

From first launcher: t=2,4,6 are visible at t=6.

From second launcher: t=3,6 are visible at t=6.

So, total 3 +2=5 fireworks at t=6.

Wait, no.

Wait, for the first launcher:

- t=2: visible from 2 to 5.

- t=4: visible from 4 to 7.

- t=6: visible from 6 to 9.

At t=6, t=4 and t=6 are visible.

For the second launcher:

- t=3: visible from 3 to 6.

- t=6: visible from 6 to 9.

At t=6, t=6 is visible.

So, total: 2 from first +1 from second=3.

Wait, but earlier I thought t=3 is visible from 3 to 6, which includes t=6.

Wait, no, at t=6, t=3 is visible until t=6, which means at t=6, it's still visible.

Similarly, t=6 is visible from t=6 to t=9.

So, from second launcher, both t=3 and t=6 are visible at t=6.

Wait, no.

Wait, the visibility is from t to t+m.

So, for t=3, visibility from t=3 to t=6 inclusive.

Similarly, for t=6, from t=6 to t=9 inclusive.

So, at t=6, both t=3 and t=6 are visible.

Hence, 2 from second launcher.

And from first launcher, t=4 and t=6 are visible.

So, total 2 +2=4.

But according to the code, it would output mn=min(2,3)+3=5, then 5//2 +5//3=2 +1=3.

But in reality, at t=6, there are 4 fireworks visible.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, it seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking back at the code:

if m % a ==0 and m % b ==0 and a !=1 and b !=1:

print(mn //a + mn //b +1)

else:

print(mn //a + mn //b)

In my example, a=2, b=3, m=3.

m % a =3%2=1 !=0, so it would print mn//a + mn//b =5//2 +5//3=2 +1=3, which matches the actual maximum of 4.

Hence, in this case, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, it seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct for the sample inputs because in those cases, the maximum occurs at t=mn=min(a,b)+m.

But in my example, the maximum occurs at t=6, which is mn=5, but the maximum is at t=6.

Wait, mn=min(a,b)+m=2+3=5.

But in my calculation, at t=6, there are more fireworks visible.

Hence, the code might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct because at t=6, m=3, which is not divisible by a=2 and b=3, so it prints mn//a + mn//b=5//2 +5//3=2 +1=3, but in reality, it's 4.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, it seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct for the sample inputs, but not in general.

Wait, but in the sample input, for a=1, b=1, m=1, output is 4, which matches.

Wait, for a=1, b=1, m=1, at t=1, fireworks from both launchers at t=1 are visible from t=1 to t=2.

At t=1, both launchers launch, and their fireworks are visible until t=2.

At t=2, both are still visible.

At t=3, the next launch happens, so fireworks from t=1 are no longer visible, but t=2 and t=3 are visible.

So, at t=2, fireworks from t=1 and t=2 are visible from both launchers, totaling 4 fireworks.

Hence, the code is correct in this case.

But in my earlier example with a=2, b=3, m=3, the code outputs 3, but in reality, at t=6, there are 4 fireworks visible.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

At t=6:

First launcher: launches at t=2,4,6.

Fireworks visible at t=6: t=4 and t=6.

Second launcher: launches at t=3,6.

Fireworks visible at t=6: t=3 and t=6.

Total: 4 fireworks.

But according to the code, it would output 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the code is calculating the maximum possible number of fireworks based on the number of launches up to mn=min(a,b)+m.

But in my example, at t=6, which is greater than mn=5, there are 4 fireworks.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
