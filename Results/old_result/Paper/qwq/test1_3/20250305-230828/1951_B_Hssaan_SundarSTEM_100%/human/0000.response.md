Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position, and they're going to have a tournament. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between the cows in positions 1 and 2, and then each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line.

The goal is to maximize the number of wins for a specific cow, cow k, by possibly swapping its position with another cow's position exactly once or choosing not to swap at all.

First, I need to understand how the tournament works. It's like a single-elimination tournament where the winner of each match proceeds to the next one. But in this case, the next opponent is always the next cow in the sequence.

So, the tournament progresses as follows:

1. Match 1: Position 1 vs Position 2, the winner proceeds.

2. Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs Position 3.

3. Match 3: Winner of Match 2 vs Position 4.

4. And so on, until all cows have been included.

The higher-rated cow always wins.

My task is to maximize the number of wins for cow k by possibly swapping its position with another cow's position once.

Let me think about this step by step.

Option 1: Do nothing, keep cow k in its original position.

In this case, I need to simulate the tournament and count how many matches cow k wins.

Option 2: Swap cow k with another cow's position and then simulate the tournament to count the wins for cow k in its new position.

I need to consider all possible positions to swap cow k with and find the one that maximizes cow k's wins.

But since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case or better.

Let me think about the tournament structure.

The tournament is essentially a linked list where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of cows that cow k can defeat in this sequence.

One approach is to find the position where cow k can start winning against the maximum number of subsequent cows.

But since the tournament is sequential, the position matters a lot.

Let me consider the two options:

1. Keep cow k in its original position.

2. Swap cow k with another position.

I need to find which swap (if any) maximizes cow k's wins.

Let me consider the initial scenario without any swap.

Simulate the tournament and see how many wins cow k gets.

Then, consider swapping cow k with another position and see if that increases the number of wins.

But simulating the entire tournament for each possible swap is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of the tournament.

The tournament proceeds in a specific order, and the higher-rated cow always wins.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve depends on how many consecutive lower-rated cows it can defeat starting from its position.

But it's not just about the cows after it; it also depends on the path to reach it.

Wait, actually, since the tournament is a sequence where each match is between the current winner and the next cow, the order matters a lot.

Let me try to model this.

Let's say the cows are in positions 1 to n.

Initially, match 1 is between position 1 and position 2.

The winner of match 1 then plays against position 3.

The winner of that plays against position 4, and so on.

So, the tournament can be represented as a binary tree where each node is a match, and the children are the participants in that match.

But in this case, it's a specific kind of binary tree where one child is always the next cow in the sequence.

Wait, actually, it's more like a linked list, where each match is between the current winner and the next cow.

Given that, the tournament can be simulated by starting from the first two cows, finding the winner, then having that winner play against the next cow, and so on.

But simulating this for large n is inefficient if done naively.

I need a better way to calculate the number of wins for cow k.

Let me consider that cow k can only participate in the tournament if it is reached in the sequence.

That is, to reach cow k, all previous cows in the sequence must have been defeated by the current winner.

So, to maximize cow k's wins, I need to position it in such a way that it is reached as late as possible in the tournament, and then it can defeat as many subsequent cows as possible.

Wait, but the earlier cow k is in the sequence, the more matches it can potentially win before being defeated.

But if it's too early, it might be defeated before reaching its optimal position.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix cow k in a certain position and see how many wins it can achieve from there.

I need to find the position where, if cow k is placed there, it can defeat the maximum number of subsequent cows.

But I need to consider that to reach that position, the previous cows must have been defeated.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate two things:

1. The number of wins if I don't swap cow k.

2. The number of wins if I swap cow k with another position.

Then, take the maximum of these two.

But calculating this for each possible swap is too slow for large n.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner of each match proceeds to the next one.

So, the tournament can be thought of as a series of matches where the current winner plays against the next cow in the sequence.

I need to maximize the number of wins for cow k.

Let me consider the initial scenario without any swap.

Simulate the tournament and count how many times cow k wins.

Then, consider swapping cow k with another position and see if that increases the number of wins.

But again, this seems inefficient.

I need to find a way to calculate this efficiently.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix cow k in position p.

Then, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Start with position 1 vs position 2.

- The winner plays against position 3.

- And so on, until position p.

- Then, cow k plays against position p+1, p+2, etc.

But actually, cow k can only start playing once it is reached in the tournament.

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

If I swap cow k to position p, then the tournament proceeds as usual, but now cow k is at position p.

So, the tournament starts with position 1 vs position 2.

The winner plays against position 3, and so on, until position p.

At position p, cow k plays against the current winner.

If cow k wins, it proceeds to play against position p+1, and so on.

I need to calculate how many wins cow k achieves in this scenario.

I need to find the position p where, if cow k is placed there, it can achieve the maximum number of wins.

I need to consider that to reach position p, the previous cows must have been defeated by the winner who reaches position p.

So, the winner who reaches position p must have defeated all previous cows.

Therefore, the winner who reaches position p is the highest-rated cow among the first p-1 cows.

Wait, not necessarily the highest-rated overall, but the one who wins the previous matches.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to find a better way.

I recall that in single-elimination tournaments, the number of wins a participant can achieve is related to how far they advance in the tournament.

In this case, since it's a bit different, I need to adapt that idea.

Let me consider that cow k can only start winning matches once it is involved in the tournament, i.e., once it is the next cow to play against the current winner.

So, if I swap cow k to an earlier position, it gets involved earlier and might get defeated sooner, thus potentially winning fewer matches.

On the other hand, if I swap it to a later position, it gets involved later and might win more matches.

But it also depends on the ratings of the cows before it.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let's define that in the tournament, the current winner starts as the winner of match 1 between position 1 and position 2.

Then, this winner plays against position 3, and so on.

So, the current winner at position i is the winner of the match between the previous winner and position i.

Now, if cow k is at position p, then the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of subsequent cows it can defeat before it loses.

But to reach position p, the previous p-1 cows must have been such that the winner who reaches position p is able to play against cow k.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix cow k at position p.

Then, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of subsequent cows (from position p+1 onwards) that it can defeat, provided that it reaches position p, i.e., the winner who reaches position p is cow k.

But for cow k to be the winner at position p, it must defeat the winner who reaches position p.

So, this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the maximum number of consecutive cows that cow k can defeat starting from its position.

But again, it's not that simple because the winner who reaches cow k's position must be cow k itself.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the largest substring starting from position p where cow k is greater than all subsequent cows.

But again, it's not just about the subsequent cows; it's about the path to reach position p.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me try to look for a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Suppose I have the sequence of cows: c1, c2, c3, ..., cn.

Initially, cow k is at position k.

I can consider two scenarios:

1. Do not swap: calculate the number of wins for cow k in its original position.

2. Swap cow k with another position p: calculate the number of wins for cow k in position p.

Then, choose the maximum between these two scenarios.

But again, iterating over all possible p is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the number of wins for cow k is equal to the length of the winning streak it can achieve starting from its position.

So, in the original position, it's the number of consecutive cows after it that it can defeat, starting from its position.

Similarly, if I swap it with position p, it's the number of consecutive cows after p that it can defeat, starting from p.

But again, this ignores the fact that to reach position p, the winner who reaches p must be cow k.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the tournament in reverse.

Start from the end and see how far cow k can win.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve.

The maximum possible wins for cow k is n - k, if it can defeat all subsequent cows.

But in reality, it might be less, depending on the ratings.

Wait, but in the tournament structure, cow k might be defeated before reaching its position.

So, I need to ensure that cow k gets to play as many matches as possible.

Swapping cow k to an earlier position might allow it to win more matches if it can defeat the initial cows.

But if it's defeated early, it wins fewer matches.

On the other hand, swapping it to a later position might protect it from early defeats, allowing it to win more matches.

But it's not straightforward.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 6, k = 1

ratings: 12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3

original positions: 1:12, 2:10, 3:14, 4:11, 5:8, 6:3

If we do nothing:

Match 1: 12 vs 10, 12 wins.

Match 2: 12 vs 14, 14 wins.

Match 3: 14 vs 11, 14 wins.

Match 4: 14 vs 8, 14 wins.

Match 5: 14 vs 3, 14 wins.

So, cow k (cow 1 with rating 12) wins only one match.

Now, if we swap cow k with position 3 (rating 14):

New sequence: 14, 10, 12, 11, 8, 3

Match 1: 14 vs 10, 14 wins.

Match 2: 14 vs 12, 14 wins.

Match 3: 14 vs 11, 14 wins.

Match 4: 14 vs 8, 14 wins.

Match 5: 14 vs 3, 14 wins.

So, cow k (original cow 1 with rating 12, now in position 3) gets to play only one match, against 11, and wins it.

Wait, no.

Wait, in this swap, cow k is now in position 3 with rating 12.

The tournament proceeds as follows:

Match 1: 14 vs 10, 14 wins.

Match 2: 14 vs 12, 14 wins.

Match 3: 14 vs 11, 14 wins.

Match 4: 14 vs 8, 14 wins.

Match 5: 14 vs 3, 14 wins.

So, cow k (rating 12) only plays one match against 11 and wins it.

Similarly, in the original scenario, cow k plays one match against 10 and wins it.

So, in both cases, cow k wins one match.

But according to the first test case, the answer is 1.

But in the explanation, they say that by swapping cow k to position 3, cow k can win 2 matches.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the explanation for the second test case, they swap cow k to position 3 and cow k wins 2 matches.

Wait, no, in the second test case, n=6, k=5, ratings=7,2,727,10,12,13.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look back at the first test case.

In the first test case, it says it's optimal to do nothing, and cow k wins 1 match.

So, in the original positions, cow k wins 1 match.

If I swap cow k to position 3, as I did above, cow k still only wins 1 match.

So, perhaps swapping doesn't help in this case.

Wait, maybe I need to choose a different position to swap.

Let me try swapping cow k to position 4.

New sequence: 11,10,14,12,8,3

Match 1:11 vs 10, 11 wins.

Match 2:11 vs 14, 14 wins.

Match 3:14 vs 12, 14 wins.

Match 4:14 vs 8, 14 wins.

Match 5:14 vs 3, 14 wins.

So, cow k (rating 12) plays one match against 8 and wins it.

Still only one win.

Similarly, swapping to position 5:

Sequence: 8,10,14,11,12,3

Match 1:8 vs 10, 10 wins.

Match 2:10 vs 14, 14 wins.

Match 3:14 vs 11, 14 wins.

Match 4:14 vs 12, 14 wins.

Match 5:14 vs 3, 14 wins.

Cow k (rating 12) plays one match against 11 and wins it.

Again, only one win.

Swapping to position 6:

Sequence:3,10,14,11,12,8

Match 1:3 vs 10, 10 wins.

Match 2:10 vs 14, 14 wins.

Match 3:14 vs 11, 14 wins.

Match 4:14 vs 12, 14 wins.

Match 5:14 vs 8, 14 wins.

Cow k (rating 12) plays one match against 11 and wins it.

Still only one win.

So, in this case, swapping doesn't help; cow k still only wins one match.

Therefore, the optimal is to do nothing, and cow k wins one match.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, in the second test case:

n=6, k=5

ratings:7,2,727,10,12,13

original positions:1:7,2:2,3:727,4:10,5:12,6:13

If we do nothing:

Match 1:7 vs 2, 7 wins.

Match 2:7 vs 727, 727 wins.

Match 3:727 vs 10, 727 wins.

Match 4:727 vs 12, 727 wins.

Match 5:727 vs 13, 727 wins.

So, cow k (cow 5 with rating 12) never gets to play any match because the winner is 727, who defeats everyone else.

So, in this case, cow k wins 0 matches if we do nothing.

Now, the explanation says that it's optimal to swap cow k to position 3.

Wait, position 3 has rating 727, which is higher than cow k's rating 12.

If we swap cow k to position 3, then position 3 becomes 12, and position 5 becomes 727.

So, new sequence:1:7,2:2,3:12,4:10,5:727,6:13

Now, the tournament proceeds as follows:

Match 1:7 vs 2, 7 wins.

Match 2:7 vs 12, 12 wins.

Match 3:12 vs 10, 12 wins.

Match 4:12 vs 727, 727 wins.

Match 5:727 vs 13, 727 wins.

So, cow k (rating 12) plays two matches and wins both before being defeated by 727.

Hence, it wins 2 matches.

That seems better than the original 0 wins.

So, in this case, swapping cow k to position 3 maximizes its wins to 2.

Interesting.

Now, is there a general way to find the best position to swap cow k to?

I need to find a position p such that:

- If I swap cow k to position p, then cow k can win as many matches as possible starting from position p.

But again, to reach position p, the winner who reaches position p must be able to play against cow k.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix cow k at position p.

Then, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of subsequent cows it can defeat before losing to a higher-rated cow.

But to reach position p, the winner who reaches position p must be cow k.

Wait, no.

Actually, to reach position p, the winner who reaches position p must have defeated all previous cows up to position p-1.

Then, cow k at position p plays against this winner.

If cow k has a higher rating, it wins and proceeds; otherwise, it loses.

If cow k wins, it proceeds to play against position p+1, and so on.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of subsequent cows it can defeat starting from position p, provided that it wins against the winner who reaches position p.

But determining who the winner is who reaches position p is complicated.

Perhaps I need to find the minimal rating required to reach position p, and ensure that cow k has a higher rating than that.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of the initial winner.

In the tournament, the initial winner is the winner between position 1 and position 2.

Then, this winner plays against position 3, and so on.

So, the winner who reaches position p is the winner of the matches between positions 1 to p-1.

Therefore, the winner who reaches position p is the highest-rated cow among positions 1 to p-1.

Wait, not necessarily the highest-rated overall, but the one who wins the matches.

In a single-elimination tournament, the winner is the maximal element in terms of rating.

Wait, in this tournament structure, the winner who reaches position p is the winner of the matches between positions 1 to p-1.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, the winner who reaches position p is the highest-rated cow among positions 1 to p-1.

Yes, that makes sense.

Because the highest-rated cow will always defeat any lower-rated cow.

Therefore, the winner who reaches position p is the maximum-rated cow among positions 1 to p-1.

Hence, if I place cow k at position p, then cow k will play against this maximum cow among positions 1 to p-1.

If cow k has a higher rating than this maximum, then cow k wins and proceeds to play against position p+1, and so on.

Otherwise, cow k loses immediately.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve when placed at position p is:

- 0, if its rating is less than or equal to the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1.

- Plus the number of subsequent cows it can defeat starting from position p+1, as long as it keeps winning.

Wait, no.

Actually, if cow k's rating is higher than the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1, then it wins against that winner and proceeds to play against position p+1.

Then, it can continue winning as long as its rating is higher than the next cow's rating.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve when placed at position p is:

- It automatically wins against the winner of positions 1 to p-1 (1 win).

- Plus the number of subsequent cows (from p+1 onwards) that it can defeat consecutively.

But only if its rating is higher than the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1.

Otherwise, it doesn't even win the first match at position p.

So, for each possible position p, the number of wins for cow k is:

- 0, if a_k <= max(a[1 to p-1])

- 1 + the length of the winning streak starting from position p+1, as long as a_k > a[p+1], a[k] > a[p+2], etc.

This seems manageable.

Now, to compute this efficiently, I need to precompute two things:

1. The maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1, for each p from 1 to n.

2. The length of the winning streak for cow k starting from each position p, assuming it has already won against the winner up to p-1.

But actually, for each p, if a_k > max(a[1 to p-1]), then cow k can win against the winner up to p-1, and then proceed to win against as many subsequent cows as its rating allows.

So, for each p, if a_k > max(a[1 to p-1]), then the number of wins is 1 plus the number of consecutive cows after p that have a lower rating than a_k.

Otherwise, it's 0.

So, I can precompute the maximum prefix values and the number of consecutive cows with ratings less than a_k starting from each position.

Then, for each p, if a_k > max(a[1 to p-1]), then the number of wins is 1 plus the number of consecutive cows after p with ratings less than a_k.

Else, it's 0.

Then, I can find the maximum over all p, including p being the original position of cow k.

This seems efficient.

Let me formalize this.

Let a_k be the rating of cow k.

Compute:

- prefix_max[p] = max(a[1], a[2], ..., a[p-1])

- suffix_streak[p] = the number of consecutive positions starting from p+1 where a[q] < a_k

Then, for each p from 1 to n:

if a_k > prefix_max[p]:

wins[p] = 1 + suffix_streak[p]

else:

wins[p] = 0

Then, the answer is the maximum value among wins[p] for all p from 1 to n.

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently:

- Compute prefix_max[p] for all p from 1 to n.

- Compute suffix_streak[p] for all p from 1 to n.

Both can be done in O(n) time per test case.

Then, for each p, calculate wins[p] in O(1) time.

Finally, take the maximum over all p.

This should be efficient enough, given the constraints.

Now, let's see.

In the first test case:

n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

original positions:1:12,2:10,3:14,4:11,5:8,6:3

Compute prefix_max:

p=1: max() = 0 (no elements)

p=2: max(12) = 12

p=3: max(12,10)=12

p=4: max(12,10,14)=14

p=5: max(12,10,14,11)=14

p=6: max(12,10,14,11,8)=14

Compute suffix_streak[p]:

For p=1:

starting from 2: a[2]=10 <12 →1

a[3]=14 >=12 → stop → suffix_streak[1]=1

p=2:

starting from 3: a[3]=14 >=12 → stop → suffix_streak[2]=0

p=3:

starting from 4: a[4]=11 <12 →1

a[5]=8 <12 →2

a[6]=3 <12 →3

→ suffix_streak[3]=3

p=4:

starting from 5: a[5]=8 <12 →1

a[6]=3 <12 →2

→ suffix_streak[4]=2

p=5:

starting from 6: a[6]=3 <12 →1

→ suffix_streak[5]=1

p=6:

no subsequent cows → suffix_streak[6]=0

Now, for each p:

p=1:

if 12 > prefix_max[1]=0 → yes

wins[1]=1 + suffix_streak[1]=1+1=2

p=2:

if 12 > prefix_max[2]=12 → no → wins[2]=0

p=3:

if 12 > prefix_max[3]=12 → no → wins[3]=0

p=4:

if 12 > prefix_max[4]=14 → no → wins[4]=0

p=5:

if 12 > prefix_max[5]=14 → no → wins[5]=0

p=6:

if 12 > prefix_max[6]=14 → no → wins[6]=0

So, the maximum is 2.

But according to the first test case, the answer is 1.

Wait, there must be a mistake.

Wait, in the first test case, the answer is 1, but according to this calculation, it's 2.

But in the original simulation, cow k only wins 1 match if not swapped.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, in the first test case, it says that the answer is 1, but according to this calculation, it's 2.

Maybe the problem has some constraints that I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that cow k cannot be swapped to its original position.

But in this case, p=1 is the original position, and wins[1]=2, which is better than not swapping.

But in reality, in the original position, cow k wins only 1 match.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in calculating wins[p].

Wait, in p=1:

if a_k > prefix_max[1]=0 → yes

then wins[1]=1 + suffix_streak[1]=1 +1=2

But in reality, in the original position, cow k only wins 1 match.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the number of wins is not 1 + suffix_streak[p], but just suffix_streak[p].

Because suffix_streak[p] represents the number of consecutive cows after p that cow k can defeat.

But then, in p=1, suffix_streak[1]=1, which matches the original one win.

Similarly, in p=3, suffix_streak[3]=3, which would give 3 wins, but in the explanation, they get 2 wins.

Wait, perhaps I need to subtract overlapping wins.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

if a_k > prefix_max[p-1]:

wins[p] = suffix_streak[p-1] + 1

else:

wins[p] = 0

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

When cow k is placed at position p, it first has to defeat the winner up to p-1, which is prefix_max[p-1].

If a_k > prefix_max[p-1], then it wins that match (1 win), and then it can proceed to defeat any number of subsequent cows with ratings less than a_k.

So, the number of wins should be 1 (for defeating the winner up to p-1) plus the number of subsequent cows it can defeat.

But in p=1, prefix_max[0]=0, so a_k > 0, so wins[1]=1 + suffix_streak[1]=1+1=2.

But in reality, in the original position, cow k only wins 1 match.

So, perhaps there is an overlap or miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the suffix_streak[p] should be the number of consecutive cows starting from p+1 that have ratings less than a_k.

In p=1, suffix_streak[1]=1 (only position 2:10 <12).

But in reality, in the original position, cow k only wins against position 2, and then loses to position 3:14.

So, wins=1.

But according to the formula, wins[1]=1 +1=2.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the number of wins is not 1 + suffix_streak[p], but rather 1 + suffix_streak[p+1], because after winning against the winner up to p-1, it then plays against p+1, and so on.

Let me check.

In p=1:

wins[1]=1 (defeating position 2:10) + suffix_streak[2]=0 → total wins=1.

In p=3:

wins[3]=1 (defeating the winner up to p-1=2: max(12,10)=12, but cow k has a_k=12, which is not greater than 12 → wins[3]=0.

Wait, but in the explanation, when swapping to position 3, cow k wins 2 matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, in p=3:

prefix_max[3]=max(12,10)=12

a_k=12 <=12 → wins[3]=0.

But in reality, in the explanation, they have cow k at position 3 with a_k=12, and the winner up to p-1 is 12, but cow k has the same rating, so it should lose immediately.

But in the explanation, they say cow k wins 2 matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that higher-rated cows always win, so equal ratings are not considered.

Assuming that equal ratings do not occur, since it's given that all a_i are distinct.

Wait, no, it says all a_i are pairwise different, so no ties.

So, in p=3:

prefix_max[3]=12, a_k=12, which is not greater, so wins[3]=0.

But in the explanation, they have cow k at position 3 with a_k=12, and the winner up to p-1 is 12, so cow k loses immediately.

But in their simulation, they show cow k winning two matches.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, in their explanation for the second test case, they swap cow k to position 3, with a_k=12.

Then:

Match 1:7 vs 2, 7 wins.

Match 2:7 vs 12, 12 wins.

Match 3:12 vs 10, 12 wins.

Match 4:12 vs 727, 727 wins.

Match 5:727 vs 13, 727 wins.

So, cow k wins two matches: against 7 and against 10.

Hence, wins=2.

But according to my formula:

prefix_max[3]=max(7,2)=7

a_k=12 >7 → wins[3]=1 + suffix_streak[3]

suffix_streak[3]= number of consecutive cows after p=3 with rating <12.

Position 4:10<12 →1

Position 5:727>12 → stop

So, suffix_streak[3]=1

Hence, wins[3]=1 +1=2, which matches the explanation.

Wait, but in the first test case, for p=1:

prefix_max[1]=0

a_k=12 >0 → wins[1]=1 + suffix_streak[1]

suffix_streak[1]=1 (position 2:10<12)

So, wins[1]=2

But in reality, in the original position, cow k only wins 1 match.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, in the original position, p=1:

Match 1:12 vs 10, 12 wins.

Match 2:12 vs 14, 14 wins.

So, cow k wins 1 match.

But according to the formula, wins[1]=2.

So, there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

wins[p] = suffix_streak[p]

Instead of 1 + suffix_streak[p]

Because suffix_streak[p] already includes the number of consecutive wins starting from position p+1.

But in the explanation, when swapping to p=3, cow k wins two matches: against 7 and against 10.

But suffix_streak[3]=1 (only position 4:10<12).

Wait, perhaps I need to include the win against the winner up to p-1.

Wait, maybe the number of wins is 1 (winning against the winner up to p-1) plus the number of consecutive wins against subsequent cows.

But in p=1, winning against the winner up to p-1 is winning against nothing, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps for p=1, the winner up to p-1 is nonexistent, so cow k automatically proceeds to play against position 2.

Hence, wins[p=1]= suffix_streak[1]=1, which matches the original one win.

Similarly, for p=3:

wins[p=3]=1 (winning against the winner up to p-1=7) + suffix_streak[3]=1 → total wins=2, which matches the explanation.

So, perhaps the formula is:

wins[p] = (1 if a_k > prefix_max[p-1] else 0) + suffix_streak[p]

But in p=1, prefix_max[0]=0, a_k >0 →1 + suffix_streak[1]=1+1=2, but in reality, it's only 1 win.

Wait, perhaps for p=1, the win against the winner up to p-1 doesn't count because there is no p-1.

So, maybe for p=1, wins[p=1]= suffix_streak[1]

For p>1, wins[p] = (1 if a_k > prefix_max[p-1] else 0) + suffix_streak[p]

Wait, in p=1, cow k plays against position 2, and if it wins, it proceeds to play against position 3, and so on.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive wins starting from position 2.

Hence, for p=1, wins[p=1]= suffix_streak[1]

For p>1, wins[p] = (1 if a_k > prefix_max[p-1] else 0) + suffix_streak[p]

This seems consistent with the first test case.

In p=1:

wins[p=1]= suffix_streak[1]=1 → which matches the original one win.

In p=3:

wins[p=3]=1 (since a_k=12 > prefix_max[2]=12? no, wait.

prefix_max[2]=max(a[1],a[2])=max(12,10)=12

a_k=12 <=12 →0 + suffix_streak[3]=0

But in the explanation, they have wins=2.

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

In p=3:

prefix_max[3]=max(a[1],a[2])=12

a_k=12 <=12 → wins[p=3]=0

But in the explanation, they have wins=2.

So, perhaps the formula is:

wins[p] = (1 if a_k > prefix_max[p-1] else 0) + (suffix_streak[p] if a_k > prefix_max[p-1] else 0)

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's:

if a_k > prefix_max[p-1]:

wins[p] = 1 + suffix_streak[p]

else:

wins[p]=0

In p=3:

a_k=12 <= prefix_max[3-1]=12 → wins[p=3]=0

But in reality, in the explanation, they have wins=2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when swapping cow k to position p, the suffix_streak[p] needs to be adjusted because cow k is now at p.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate suffix_streak[p] as the number of consecutive cows after p that have a lower rating than a_k.

So, in p=3:

suffix_streak[3]= number of consecutive cows after p=3 with a[q]<a_k=12.

Which is position 4:10<12 →1

position 5:727>12 → stop

So, suffix_streak[3]=1

Then, wins[p=3]=1 (win against prefix_max[2]=12, but a_k=12 <=12 → cannot win this match.

Wait, but in the explanation, they have cow k winning against the winner up to p-1=12 with a_k=12, which should be a loss, but in their simulation, cow k wins against 7 and then against 10.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, in their explanation, they swap cow k to position 3, so the sequence is:

position 1:7, position 2:2, position 3:12, position 4:10, position 5:727, position 6:13

Match 1:7 vs 2, 7 wins.

Match 2:7 vs 12, 12 wins.

Match 3:12 vs 10, 12 wins.

Match 4:12 vs 727, 727 wins.

Match 5:727 vs 13, 727 wins.

So, cow k wins two matches: against 7 and against 10.

Hence, wins=2.

But according to my formula:

prefix_max[3]=max(a[1],a[2])=12

a_k=12 <=12 → wins[p=3]=0

Which contradicts the simulation.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if a_k > prefix_max[p-1], then it wins against the winner up to p-1, and then can proceed to win against subsequent cows as long as a_k > a[p+1], a[p+2], etc.

In p=3:

a_k=12 > prefix_max[2]=12? no, 12<=12 → cannot win against the winner up to p-1.

But in the simulation, cow k wins against 7 (which is less than 12), and then against 10 (which is less than 12), and then loses to 727.

So, in reality, cow k wins two matches, but according to my formula, wins[p=3]=0.

There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the winner up to p-1 is 7, not 12, because the winner up to p-1 is the winner of the matches up to p-1.

Wait, in the tournament, the winner up to p-1 is not necessarily the maximum rating among a[1 to p-1], because the tournament structure is sequential.

Wait, maybe I need to recast my understanding.

Let me simulate the tournament step by step to see who the winner up to p-1 is.

In the first test case, original positions:

1:12, 2:10, 3:14, 4:11, 5:8, 6:3

Match 1:12 vs 10, 12 wins.

Match 2:12 vs 14, 14 wins.

Match 3:14 vs 11, 14 wins.

Match 4:14 vs 8, 14 wins.

Match 5:14 vs 3, 14 wins.

So, the winner up to p-1 for p=3 is 12.

But in reality, the winner up to p-1 is the winner of match 2, which is 14.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the current winner as the tournament progresses.

Let me keep track of the current winner:

Initialize current_winner = a[1]

For each position i from 2 to p-1:

if a[i] > current_winner:

current_winner = a[i]

Else:

current_winner remains the same.

So, in p=3:

current_winner starts as a[1]=12

Compare with a[2]=10: 12 >10 → current_winner remains 12

Hence, winner up to p-1=12

So, when cow k is at p=3 with a_k=12, it has a_k <= current_winner=12 → loses immediately.

But in the explanation, they have cow k winning against 7 and then against 10.

Wait, in their simulation, they have:

Match 1:7 vs 2, 7 wins.

Match 2:7 vs 12, 12 wins.

Match 3:12 vs 10, 12 wins.

Match 4:12 vs 727, 727 wins.

So, in this case, the winner up to p-1=2 is 7, which is less than a_k=12, so cow k wins against 7, then against 10.

Hence, the winner up to p-1 is not the maximum among a[1 to p-1], but the winner of the tournament up to p-1, which is different.

In the first test case, with p=3:

a[1]=7, a[2]=2

Match 1:7 vs 2, 7 wins
