Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of the sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. The constraints say that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9, which is a pretty large number.

First, I recall that with a set of numbers where each number is a power of 2, any integer can be represented as a sum of these numbers uniquely, because of the binary representation of numbers.

For example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...], any number can be represented as a sum of these elements, as long as I don't exceed the total sum of the sequence.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the possibility of any subsequence summing to k, while still being able to sum to every other v between 1 and n.

So, maybe I can start with a sequence that can sum up to any number up to some limit, and then modify it to exclude the possibility of summing to k.

One approach could be to use a sequence that can sum up to any number up to n, and then adjust it so that k cannot be achieved.

But how?

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

If I take the first m powers of 2, where m is at least log2(n), I can represent any number up to n as a sum of these powers.

For example, if n=10, I can take [1, 2, 4, 8], which allows me to sum up to 15, which is more than 10.

But I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to k.

So, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 4, 8], the sums of subsequences are all the numbers from 1 to 15, in this case.

But I need to exclude k from being sumable, while still being able to sum to all other v between 1 and n.

So, I need to modify this sequence so that k cannot be achieved as a sum, but all other v can.

One idea is to remove an element that is necessary for summing to k.

For example, if k=3 and the sequence is [1, 2, 4], then 3 can be achieved by 1+2.

So, if I remove 2, then 3 cannot be achieved, but other sums might be affected.

Wait, but I need to make sure that all other v can still be achieved.

In this case, removing 2 would prevent summing to 3, but also prevent summing to 2 and 3, which is not desirable if v=2 is allowed.

Hmm.

Maybe a better approach is to include elements in such a way that k cannot be achieved, but all other v can.

Another idea is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

Let me consider the binary representation again.

If I have the sequence [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(m-1)], then any number up to 2^m - 1 can be represented uniquely.

But I need to exclude only k from being sumable.

So, perhaps I can remove a specific element that is crucial for summing to k, while ensuring that other sums can still be achieved.

Alternatively, maybe I can include elements in a way that the sum k cannot be achieved, but all other sums can.

Wait, the problem says that a solution always exists, so I don't have to worry about cases where it's impossible.

Given that, I need to find a general method to construct such a sequence for any n and k within the constraints.

Let me think about the properties of k.

If k is 0, but k is at least 1 according to the problem, so k starts from 1.

If k is 1, then I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, but all other v from 2 to n are possible.

For example, if n=2 and k=1, then I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 1, but there is a subsequence that sums to 2.

So, [2] would work, because the only subsequence is [2], which sums to 2, and there is no subsequence that sums to 1.

Similarly, for n=6 and k=1, the sequence [2,3,4,5,6] would work, as shown in the example output.

In this case, all sums from 2 to 6 are possible, but 1 is not achievable.

So, in this case, excluding 1 from the sequence prevents any subsequence from summing to 1, and including higher numbers allows sums up to n.

But what if k is not 1? What if k is somewhere in the middle?

For example, n=9 and k=3.

I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 3, but all other sums from 1 to 9, except 3, are possible.

One possible sequence is [7,1,4,1], as shown in the example output.

Let's see:

Possible subsequences and their sums:

- [7]: 7

- [1]: 1

- [4]: 4

- [1]: 1

- [7,1]: 8

- [7,4]: 11 (which is greater than n, but allowed)

- [7,1,1]: 9

- [1,4]: 5

- [1,1]: 2

- [7,1,4]: 12

- [7,1,4,1]: 13

- [1,4,1]: 6

- [7,4,1]: 12

- [7,1,1]: 9

- [7,4,1]: 12

So, the sums achievable are: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9. Missing 3, as required.

So, in this case, by choosing specific elements, we can prevent the sum k from being achievable while allowing others.

Another example: n=8 and k=8.

The output is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which sums up to 7, which is less than 8.

So, no subsequence can sum to 8, but all sums from 1 to 7 are possible.

This makes sense.

So, in this case, by choosing elements that cannot sum up to k, but can sum up to other values.

Wait, but in this case, the total sum is less than k, so no subsequence can exceed that sum.

But in the previous case, the total sum is greater than k, but k is still not achievable.

So, it's not just about the total sum being less than or equal to k; it's about the specific combinations that prevent k from being achieved.

So, I need a general strategy to construct such a sequence.

Let me consider the binary representation approach again.

If I take the first m powers of 2, I can represent any number up to 2^m - 1.

But I need to exclude k.

So, maybe I can take all powers of 2 up to some point, and then adjust for k.

Wait, but the problem allows up to 25 elements, which is more than enough to represent any number up to 10^6, since 2^25 is over 33 million.

But I need to exclude k specifically.

Another idea: since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and the elements can be up to 10^9, I can be flexible in choosing the elements.

I need to ensure that the sequence can generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

One way to approach this is to start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it so that k cannot be achieved.

For example, start with a sequence that can generate all sums up to n, like the first m powers of 2 where m is such that 2^m > n.

Then, to prevent k from being achievable, I can remove or adjust certain elements.

But removing an element might affect other sums as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements in a way that covers all sums except k.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except k.

This means that the subset sum problem for this sequence should cover all integers from 1 to n except k.

This is similar to the concept of a complete set of residues modulo something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if I have a sequence that can generate all sums up to a certain value, and then adjust it to exclude k.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be applied here.

But that might be too time-consuming for the problem constraints.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, I need an efficient solution.

I need to find a way to construct the sequence in a general way that works for any n and k.

Let me consider the example where n=9 and k=3, with the sequence [7,1,4,1].

In this sequence, the sums cover 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9, but not 3.

How was this sequence constructed?

Well, 7 + 1 = 8, 7 + 4 = 11, 7 + 1 + 4 = 12, 1 + 4 = 5, 1 + 1 = 2, 7 + 1 + 1 = 9, and so on.

So, by choosing 7,1,4,1, they cover the necessary sums.

But how to generalize this?

Another idea: maybe start with a base sequence that can generate all sums except k, and then adjust it accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can take a sequence that generates all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it by replacing or removing elements involved in summing to k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the properties of k.

If k is a power of 2, say k=4, which is 2^2, then in the sequence [1,2,4,8,...], k is directly present.

So, if I remove 4, then k cannot be achieved, but other sums might be affected.

For example, with n=9 and k=4, if I remove 4 from [1,2,4,8], I get [1,2,8], which can sum to 1,2,3,9, but not 4.

But I need to cover all v from 1 to 9 except 4.

Wait, but 3 can be achieved by 1+2, and 9 by 1+8, etc.

So, in this case, removing k from the sequence prevents it from being achieved, but other sums are still possible.

Is this always the case?

Let me consider another example.

Let n=5 and k=3.

If I take the sequence [1,2,4], the sums are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

To prevent summing to 3, I can remove 2, leaving [1,4].

Then, possible sums are 1 and 4 and 1+4=5.

But I need sums 1,2,4,5, excluding 3.

How to achieve sum of 2?

Well, in this case, removing 2 prevents summing to 3, but also prevents summing to 2.

So, this approach doesn't work.

Hence, simply removing k from the sequence might not suffice, as it can affect other sums.

So, I need a better strategy.

Let me consider the case where k is 1.

In this case, to prevent any subsequence summing to 1, I just need to avoid including 1 in the sequence.

Then, all subsequences will have sums starting from at least 2, assuming the smallest element is 2.

For example, sequence [2,3,4,5,6] for n=6 and k=1.

Here, the smallest sum is 2, and can go up to 2+3+4+5+6=20, which covers all v from 2 to 6.

So, this works.

Similarly, for k=8 and n=8, sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which sums up to 7, covers all v from 1 to 7, excluding 8.

So, in this case, by choosing elements that cannot sum to k, but can sum to other values.

Another idea: if k is present in the sequence, then to prevent any subsequence from summing to k, I need to ensure that no single element is equal to k, and no combination of elements sums to k.

Wait, but if k is present in the sequence, then the subsequence consisting of just k sums to k, which is not allowed.

Therefore, k cannot be present in the sequence.

So, one necessary condition is that k is not in the sequence.

But that might not be sufficient, because other combinations might still sum to k.

So, I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

This sounds similar to the subset sum problem, which is NP-complete, but since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, it's manageable.

But I need an efficient solution for t up to 1000 and n up to 10^6.

So, I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

If I have a sequence where the sums cover all numbers from 1 to n, except k, then the sequence should be able to generate all v except k.

This is similar to having the entire range covered, and then excluding k.

But how to construct such a sequence efficiently.

Another approach: use the fact that with a sequence of powers of 2, I can represent any number uniquely.

But I need to modify this to exclude k.

Wait, perhaps I can take the binary representation of k and adjust the sequence accordingly.

For example, if k has a specific binary representation, I can exclude certain powers of 2.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that.

Suppose k is 3, which is 11 in binary.

If I have the sequence [1,2,4,8,...], then 3 is 1+2.

So, to prevent any subsequence from summing to 3, I need to ensure that 1 and 2 are not both present in any subsequence.

But that seems tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can replace some elements to break the sum k, while keeping the ability to sum to other values.

Another idea: use the concept of minimal sequences that can generate all sums except k.

But I need to ensure that the sequence has at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and m is at most 25, which is feasible since 2^25 is over 33 million, which is way above 10^6.

So, with 25 elements, I can cover sums up to a very large number.

But I need to make sure that k is not achievable.

Wait, perhaps I can take the first 25 powers of 2, which would allow me to represent any number up to 2^25 - 1, which is more than enough for n up to 10^6.

But then, to exclude k, I need to modify this sequence so that k cannot be achieved.

But if I have all powers of 2 up to 2^24, their sums can represent any number up to 2^25 - 1.

So, how can I modify this to exclude k?

One way is to remove the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

Wait, but that might not suffice.

Let me think.

If I remove the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, then k cannot be achieved, because that bit is missing.

But other sums might still be achievable.

For example, if k=3, which is 11 in binary, and the sequence is [1,2,4,8,...], removing 2 would make it [1,4,8,...].

Now, 3 cannot be achieved because 2 is missing, but 1 can still be achieved with [1], and 2 cannot be achieved, but since k=3, and v can be 1 or 2, but in this case, v cannot be 2, which is less than k.

Wait, but v can be any value from 1 to n except k.

So, in this case, v=2 should be achievable, but it's not, because 2 was removed.

Hmm.

So, this approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: include elements in such a way that their sums cover all v except k.

One possible way is to include elements that can generate all sums except k.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that the sequence should be able to generate all sums from 1 to n, except k.

This is similar to having the entire set minus the sum k.

But I need to find a sequence that achieves this.

Wait, perhaps I can start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

But how?

Another idea: use the fact that if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then remove an element that is necessary for summing to k, but not necessary for summing to other v.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can use the minimal number of elements to cover all sums except k.

But I need to ensure that with m <= 25, which is given.

Given that, perhaps I can always take m=25, with elements being the first 25 powers of 2, and adjust the sequence based on k.

Wait, but in the given program, it's taking m=25 and sequence=[2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^24].

But according to the problem, the sequence should consist of non-negative integers, and 2^24 is less than 10^9, so it's acceptable.

But in the example, for n=2 and k=2, the output is m=1 and sequence=[1], which sums to 1, which is v=1, and cannot sum to 2, which is k.

So, in this case, m=1 suffices.

Similarly, for n=6 and k=1, m=5 with sequence=[2,3,4,5,6], which can sum to all v from 2 to 6, but not 1.

So, in this case, m=5.

But according to the given program, it's always taking m=25 and sequence=[2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^24].

But in the example, for n=2 and k=2, m=1 and sequence=[1] is acceptable.

So, why is the given program taking m=25 always?

Is it correct?

Wait, in the given program, it's taking m=25 and sequence=[2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^24] for every test case.

But according to the problem, m can be from 1 to 25.

So, is this always correct?

Let's check for the first test case: n=2, k=2.

Sequence=[1,2,4,...,2^24].

Possible sums include 1,2,3,4,..., up to a very large number.

But I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 2, but still, there is a subsequence that sums to 1.

But in this sequence, [1] sums to 1, and [2] sums to 2, which violates the condition that no subsequence should sum to k=2.

So, this is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but according to the example, for n=2 and k=2, the correct output is m=1 and sequence=[1].

In this sequence, only [1] sums to 1, and there is no subsequence that sums to 2, which is correct.

But the given program outputs m=25 and sequence=[1,2,4,...,2^24], which includes [2], which sums to 2, violating the condition.

So, the given program is incorrect for this test case.

Another test case: n=6 and k=1.

According to the example, m=5 and sequence=[2,3,4,5,6].

In this sequence, no subsequence sums to 1, but all other v from 2 to 6 are achievable.

But according to the given program, it outputs m=25 and sequence=[1,2,4,...,2^24], which includes 1, so [1] sums to 1, which violates the condition that no subsequence should sum to k=1.

So, again, incorrect.

Another test case: n=8 and k=8.

Example output is m=7 with sequence=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which sums up to 7, so no subsequence sums to 8, and all v from 1 to 7 are achievable.

But according to the given program, m=25 and sequence=[1,2,4,...,2^24], which can sum to 8 via [8], which is present in the sequence, violating the condition.

So, the given program is incorrect for this test case as well.

Similarly, for n=9 and k=3, the example output is m=4 with sequence=[7,1,4,1], which cannot sum to 3, but can sum to other v from 1 to 9 except 3.

But the given program outputs m=25 and sequence=[1,2,4,...,2^24], which can sum to 3 via [1,2], violating the condition.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for these test cases.

Hence, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
