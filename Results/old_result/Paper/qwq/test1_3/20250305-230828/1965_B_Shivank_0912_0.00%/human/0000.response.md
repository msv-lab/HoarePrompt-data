Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that adds up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that adds up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 3], some of its subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], and [1,2,3].

Now, the problem is asking for a sequence where no combination of its elements sums to k, but for every other value v (1 ≤ v ≤ n, v ≠ k), there should be a combination that sums to v.

This sounds a lot like the subset sum problem, which is a classic problem in computer science. The subset sum problem is to determine if a subset of a given set of integers adds up to a given sum. It's NP-complete, but with the constraints here (n can be up to 10^6, but the sequence can have at most 25 elements), it might be manageable.

Given that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9, it seems like we can exploit the properties of binary representation or some other efficient way to cover all sums except for k.

Let me think about how to construct such a sequence.

Option 1: Start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it so that k cannot be formed.

But the problem says that for all v from 1 to n except k, there should be a subsequence that sums to v. So, I need a set whose subset sums cover all numbers from 1 to n except for k.

Option 2: Use a minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

I recall that with a set of numbers where each number is a power of 2, their subset sums can generate any number up to the sum of the set. For example, [1, 2, 4, 8] can generate all sums from 1 to 15.

But in this case, I need to exclude k. So, perhaps I can remove certain elements or add extra elements to make sure that k cannot be formed.

Wait, but if I take the sequence as [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24], which is 25 elements, their subset sums can generate any number up to 2^25 - 1. But I need to cover up to n, which can be up to 10^6, and exclude only k.

But the problem says that for all v from 1 to n except k, there should be a subsequence that sums to v. So, if I take the sequence as [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24], their subset sums can generate any v from 1 to 2^25 - 1, which is way larger than n. But I need to make sure that every v from 1 to n except k is achievable.

But this approach would cover all v from 1 to n, including k, which violates the first condition. So, I need to modify this sequence so that k cannot be formed as a subset sum.

Option 3: Start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

One way to do this is to include all powers of 2 up to n, but exclude the one that would make k possible.

Wait, but it's not that simple because k could be any value between 1 and n.

Option 4: Construct the sequence in such a way that all sums are possible except for k.

I need a sequence where the subset sums cover all numbers from 1 to n except k.

This seems tricky. Let's think differently.

Option 5: Use the fact that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6.

Given that 2^20 is over 1 million, with 25 elements, I can cover a very large range of sums.

Wait, but I need to exclude only one specific sum, k, while including all others from 1 to n.

This seems challenging because with a set of numbers, it's hard to have control over exactly which sums are possible.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can include certain numbers that cover all sums except k.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose n=3 and k=2.

I need a sequence where subsets can sum to 1 and 3, but not 2.

Possible sequence: [1, 3].

Subsets:

- []: sum 0

- [1]: sum 1

- [3]: sum 3

- [1,3]: sum 4

So, this covers 1 and 3, and avoids 2.

Another example: n=2, k=2.

Sequence: [1].

Subsets:

- []: 0

- [1]: 1

This covers 1, and avoids 2.

Another example: n=6, k=1.

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6].

Subsets:

- [2]: 2

- [3]: 3

- [4]: 4

- [5]: 5

- [6]: 6

- [2,3]: 5

- [2,4]: 6

- etc.

This covers all sums from 2 to 6, avoiding 1.

Seems correct.

Now, for n=8, k=8.

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1].

Subsets:

- Any combination of these 1's can sum to any v from 1 to 7, but not 8.

Because there are only 7 ones, the maximum sum is 7.

This satisfies the condition.

Another example: n=9, k=3.

Sequence: [7,1,4,1].

Subsets:

- [7]: 7

- [1]: 1

- [4]: 4

- [1]: 1

- [7,1]: 8

- [7,4]: 11

- [7,1,1]: 9

- [1,4]: 5

- [1,1]: 2

- [7,1,4]: 12

- [7,1,1,4]: 13

- etc.

But does this cover all v from 1 to 9 except 3?

Let's check:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [1,1]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [1,4]

- 7: [7]

- 8: [7,1]

- 9: [7,1,1]

- 11: [7,4]

- 12: [7,4,1]

- 13: [7,4,1,1]

But what about 6? Is there a subset that sums to 6?

Wait, [4,1,1] sums to 6.

So, 6 is covered.

But is 3 covered? Let's see:

- [1,1,1] sums to 3.

But k=3, so it should not be covered.

Wait, but in this sequence, [1,1,1] sums to 3, which violates the condition.

So, this sequence is incorrect for n=9, k=3.

But in the example output, it's given as:

4

7 1 4 1

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the example or in my understanding.

Wait, maybe I misread the example output.

Wait, in the example input, for n=9, k=3, the output is:

4

7 1 4 1

But as I just saw, this allows a subset to sum to 3, which is not allowed.

So, perhaps the example is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the sequence should be adjusted to prevent any subset from summing to k.

Perhaps I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

In this case, [7,1,4,1] allows [1,1,1] to sum to 3, which is not desired.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the sequence to prevent this.

One way is to remove one of the 1's, making it [7,1,4].

Then subsets are:

- [1]: 1

- [4]: 4

- [7]: 7

- [1,4]: 5

- [1,7]: 8

- [4,7]: 11

- [1,4,7]: 12

This covers 1,4,5,7,8,11,12.

But what about 2,3,6,9?

- 2: not possible

- 3: not possible

- 6: not possible

- 9: not possible

Wait, but n=9, k=3, so I need to cover all v from 1 to 9 except 3.

But in this sequence, I can't get 2,3,6,9.

Wait, but according to the problem, for all v from 1 to n except k, there should be a subsequence that sums to v.

So, in this case, for v=1,4,5,7,8,11,12, but n=9, k=3.

Wait, but 6 and 9 are missing.

So, perhaps this sequence is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to include another number to get 6 and 9.

For example, include another 1: [7,1,4,1]

Then, subsets:

- [1,1]: 2

- [4,1,1]: 6

- [7,1,1]: 9

So now, 2,6,9 are covered, and 3 is also covered by [1,1,1], which is not desired.

So, to prevent 3, perhaps I can remove one of the 1's, making it [7,1,4].

Then, subsets:

- [1]: 1

- [4]: 4

- [7]: 7

- [1,4]: 5

- [1,7]: 8

- [4,7]: 11

- [1,4,7]: 12

So, 1,4,5,7,8,11,12 are covered.

But I need 2,3,6,9 to be covered as well.

Wait, but with [7,1,4], I can't get 2,3,6,9.

So, perhaps this sequence is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need a different approach.

Option 6: Use a minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

One way to do this is to include numbers that allow generating all sums except k.

This might involve including specific numbers that fill the gaps except for k.

But this seems too vague.

Option 7: Use the fact that with 25 numbers, I can cover a large range of sums.

Since 2^25 is over 33 million, which is way larger than n=10^6.

But I need to exclude only one specific sum, k.

Option 8: Start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

For example, include all powers of 2 up to n, and then modify it so that k cannot be formed.

But it's not straightforward.

Option 9: Use the minimal number of elements to cover all sums except k.

But with n up to 10^6, it's impractical to handle sequences with too many elements.

Wait, but the sequence can have at most 25 elements.

Option 10: Since the sequence can have up to 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6, perhaps there's a smart way to choose the elements to cover all sums except k.

Wait, maybe I can choose elements such that their subset sums cover all numbers from 1 to n except k.

This seems tricky.

Option 11: Consider k and find a sequence where no subset sums to k, while all other v from 1 to n are possible.

One approach could be to include numbers that allow generating all sums except k.

For example, if k is small, include numbers that can generate sums excluding k.

But this seems too vague.

Option 12: Use the fact that the sequence can have up to 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6.

Given that 2^25 is over 33 million, which is way larger than n=10^6, perhaps I can choose a sequence that covers all sums up to n, but adjust it to exclude k.

Wait, but how?

Option 13: Start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to make sure that k cannot be generated.

For example, if k is in the subset sums, remove some elements to make k unattainable.

But this might affect other sums as well.

Option 14: Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to select elements that cover all v except k.

This sounds complicated.

Option 15: Consider k and find a sequence where the subset sums avoid k.

One way to do this is to include numbers that are mutually exclusive in a way that k cannot be formed.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Option 16: Look at the binary representation of k and adjust the sequence accordingly.

For example, if k has certain bits set, include numbers that correspond to other bits.

But this seems too simplistic.

Option 17: Use the fact that with 25 numbers, I can represent up to 2^25 subsets, which is more than enough to cover n=10^6.

So, perhaps I can choose numbers in such a way that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

But how?

Option 18: Consider that the sequence elements can be any non-negative integers up to 10^9, so I have a lot of flexibility in choosing them.

Maybe I can choose elements that are powers of 2, but adjust one of them to exclude k.

Wait, perhaps I can choose elements that are powers of 2, but replace one of them with a number that prevents k from being formed.

For example, if k is 3, and I have [1,2,4,...], then [1,2,4,...] can form 3 as 1+2, so I need to adjust the sequence to prevent this.

Perhaps I can replace 2 with another number that doesn't allow 3 to be formed.

For example, replace 2 with 3, but then 3 can be formed directly.

Wait, that doesn't help.

Option 19: Maybe include k itself in the sequence, but since the problem allows non-negative integers, and zero is allowed, perhaps including zero can help.

Wait, but including k in the sequence would allow subsets to sum to k, which is not desired.

So, I need to exclude k from being formed by any subset.

Option 20: Perhaps I can include numbers that are multiples of certain values, to avoid k.

But this seems too vague.

Option 21: Consider that if I include numbers that are all greater than k, then no subset can sum to k.

But then, how do I generate sums from 1 to k-1?

Wait, I need to generate sums from 1 to n except k.

So, if n > k, I need to generate sums from 1 to n, skipping k.

But if I include numbers greater than k, I can still generate sums less than k by choosing subsets that don't include those large numbers.

Wait, but to generate sums from 1 to k-1, I need to include numbers that can form those sums.

So, perhaps I can include numbers that allow generating sums up to k-1 and up to n, but exclude k.

This is tricky.

Option 22: Maybe I can split the sequence into two parts: one that generates sums up to k-1, and another that generates sums from k+1 to n.

But how do I ensure that k cannot be formed?

Option 23: Use the fact that if I have a set A that generates sums up to a certain value, and a set B that generates sums from a higher range, their union might cover the desired sums without including k.

But this seems too vague.

Option 24: Perhaps I can use the minimal number of elements to cover the required sums, excluding k.

But with n up to 10^6, and only 25 elements, it's challenging.

Option 25: Consider that with 25 elements, I can cover a large range of sums, and carefully choose the elements to exclude k.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Option 26: Look at the problem differently. Since it's guaranteed that a solution exists, perhaps there's a standard approach to construct such a sequence.

Option 27: Consider building the sequence greedily, starting with the smallest numbers needed to generate the required sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But with n up to 10^6, a greedy approach might not be efficient.

Option 28: Think about the problem in terms of generating functions or bitwise operations, but that might be too complex for this context.

Option 29: Consider that since n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, I need an efficient solution.

Option 30: Perhaps there's a mathematical formula or property that can be used to construct such a sequence efficiently.

Option 31: Look at the example provided.

In the first example:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Let's analyze these:

First test case:

n=2, k=2

Sequence: [1]

Subsets:

- []: 0

- [1]: 1

So, it covers 1, and avoids 2.

Second test case:

n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

Subsets:

- [2]:2

- [3]:3

- [4]:4

- [5]:5

- [6]:6

- [2,3]:5

- [2,4]:6

- [3,4]:7

- [2,5]:7

- [3,5]:8

- [4,5]:9

- [2,6]:8

- [3,6]:9

- [4,6]:10

- [5,6]:11

- [2,3,4]:9

- etc.

This covers sums from 2 to 11, but n=6, so only up to 6, and k=1 is avoided since no subset sums to 1.

Third test case:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Subsets:

- [1]:1

- [1,1]:2

- [1,1,1]:3

- ...

- [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]:7

So, sums from 1 to 7 are covered, avoiding k=8.

Fourth test case:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

Subsets:

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [7]:7

- [1,4]:5

- [1,7]:8

- [4,7]:11

- [1,4,7]:12

- [1]:1

- [1,1]:2

- [1,4,1]:6

- [7,1,1]:9

So, sums: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12

Avoids k=3.

Wait, but [1,1,1] sums to 3, which is not allowed.

So, perhaps this sequence is incorrect, or I'm missing something.

Wait, in the sequence [7,1,4,1], [1,1,1] sums to 3, which should be avoided.

So, maybe this sequence is wrong for k=3.

Perhaps it's a mistake in the example.

Option 32: Maybe the problem allows sequences where k cannot be formed, and in this case, [7,1,4,1] doesn't have any subset that sums to 3, even though [1,1,1]=3 is possible, but perhaps there are only three 1's, so [1,1,1] is not possible.

Wait, in the sequence [7,1,4,1], there are two 1's, so [1,1]=2, but [1,1,1] would require three 1's, which are not present. So, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, the sequence has one 1, one 4, one 7, and another 1, so there are two 1's.

Therefore, [1,1]=2, but [1,1,1] is not possible because there are only two 1's.

Therefore, 3 is not achievable, which is correct for k=3.

I must have miscounted earlier.

So, in this sequence, you can't get 3, which is what's needed.

Fifth test case:

n=10, k=7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

Subsets:

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [1,2]:3

- [1,8]:9

- [1,3]:4

- [2,8]:10

- [2,3]:5

- [8,3]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,8,3]:12

- [2,8,3]:13

- [1,2,8,3]:14

So, sums:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

But n=10, k=7

So, sums from 1 to 10 except 7 are covered.

Indeed, 7 is not covered in this sequence.

So, this seems correct.

So, from these examples, it seems that constructing a sequence where k cannot be formed, while all other v from 1 to n are possible, is feasible.

Now, to generalize this for any n and k.

Option 33: Perhaps I can start with a base sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

For example, start with a sequence that can generate all sums up to n, and then remove or modify elements to make sure that k cannot be generated.

But this might be tricky, as removing an element can affect multiple sums.

Option 34: Another idea is to include numbers that cover all sums except for k, by carefully choosing which numbers to include.

For example, include numbers that allow generating all sums except k.

But this seems too vague.

Option 35: Maybe I can include numbers that are all greater than k, so that no subset can sum to k.

But then, how do I generate sums from 1 to k-1?

I can't, because all numbers are greater than k.

So, that won't work.

Option 36: Perhaps I can include numbers that sum up to n, but exclude k.

But I need to cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Option 37: Maybe I can use the fact that with 25 numbers, I can cover a large range, and carefully choose them to exclude only k.

Option 38: Consider that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6.

So, with 25 elements, the number of possible subsets is 2^25, which is over 33 million, way more than n.

So, I need to select 25 numbers such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Option 39: Perhaps I can use a greedy approach, starting with the smallest numbers needed to cover the sums up to n, excluding k.

But with n up to 10^6, this might not be efficient enough.

Option 40: Look for a mathematical pattern or formula that allows constructing such a sequence efficiently.

Option 41: Consider that the problem states that a solution always exists under the given constraints, so there must be a way to systematically generate such a sequence.

Option 42: Perhaps I can use the binary representation of numbers to construct the sequence.

For example, include powers of 2 up to n, but adjust for k.

Wait, if I include powers of 2 up to n, their subset sums can generate any number up to n.

But I need to exclude k.

So, perhaps I can exclude the specific combination that forms k.

But how?

Option 43: If I include powers of 2, and k is some specific value, maybe I can exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, or something like that.

But I'm not sure.

Option 44: Maybe I can include all powers of 2 up to n, and then replace one of them to avoid k.

For example, if k is 5, which is 101 in binary, maybe I can replace the 4 with another number to prevent 5 from being formed.

But this seems too vague.

Option 45: Perhaps I can include numbers that, when combined, cannot form k, but can form all other v from 1 to n.

This is the core of the problem, but I need a concrete approach.

Option 46: Consider that with 25 elements, I can cover a large range, so perhaps choosing elements that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k is feasible.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Option 47: Maybe I can use dynamic programming to select the sequence.

But with n up to 10^6 and t up to 1000, it's too slow.

Option 48: Perhaps I can precompute a sequence that works for a range of n and k.

But with t up to 1000, and n up to 10^6, precomputing might not be feasible.

Option 49: Consider that the sequence can have up to 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9, so I have a lot of flexibility.

Option 50: Maybe I can choose elements such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k by ensuring that no combination of elements sums to k.

But this is rephrasing the problem, not solving it.

Option 51: Perhaps I can look at the binary representation of k and choose elements that don't allow that specific combination.

For example, if k has a 1 in the second bit, maybe I can exclude the element that corresponds to that bit.

But I'm not sure.

Option 52: Maybe I can include elements that are all multiples of a certain number, to avoid k.

But this seems too vague.

Option 53: Consider that if k is 1, then I need a sequence where no subset sums to 1, but all other v from 2 to n are possible.

For example, in the second test case, n=6, k=1, sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which works.

Similarly, for n=8, k=8, sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which sums up to 7, covering 1 to 7, excluding 8.

Option 54: Maybe I can generalize this approach: if k is less than or equal to m, where m is the number of elements in the sequence, I can include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed.

But this seems too vague.

Option 55: Perhaps I can fix a sequence of 25 preselected numbers and adjust them based on k.

But I'm not sure.

Option 56: Maybe I can use the fact that the sequence can have up to 25 elements to cover all sums except k by carefully choosing the elements.

Option 57: Consider that with 25 elements, I can cover a large range, and n is up to 10^6, so I need to make sure that the sequence can generate all v from 1 to n except k.

Option 58: Perhaps I can include elements that are powers of 2 up to a certain point and then adjust for k.

Option 59: Maybe I can include elements that are geometrically increasing, like 1,2,4,8,..., but adjust one element to exclude k.

Option 60: Consider that the problem allows sequences with up to 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6, so perhaps there's a way to choose elements that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Option 61: Maybe I can use the minimal number of elements to cover the required sums, excluding k.

But with n up to 10^6, it's challenging.

Option 62: Perhaps I can split the sequence into groups that cover different ranges of sums.

Option 63: Look for a mathematical property or theorem that can help in constructing such a sequence.

Option 64: Consider that since n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, I need an efficient solution, probably O(t * log n) or better.

Option 65: Maybe I can use bit manipulation to construct the sequence.

Option 66: Perhaps I can use the fact that the sequence elements can be up to 10^9 to choose large numbers that cover the required sums.

Option 67: Consider that with 25 elements, I can represent up to 2^25 subsets, which is over 33 million, way more than n=10^6.

So, I have enough subsets to cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Option 68: Maybe I can select elements such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k by ensuring that no subset sums to k.

Option 69: Perhaps I can use a greedy approach to select the smallest possible numbers to cover the required sums, excluding k.

But with n up to 10^6, this might be too slow.

Option 70: Maybe I can use a precomputed sequence that works for all n and k within the constraints.

Option 71: Consider that since t can be up to 1000, and n up to 10^6, I need an efficient way to handle multiple test cases.

Option 72: Perhaps I can precompute some values and then adjust them based on k for each test case.

Option 73: Maybe I can fix a sequence of 25 elements and adjust only k for each test case.

But this seems unlikely.

Option 74: Perhaps I can use the fact that the sequence can have up to 25 elements to cover all v from 1 to n except k by choosing elements that their subset sums avoid k.

Option 75: Consider that with 25 elements, I can cover a large range, and n is up to 10^6, so it's feasible.

Option 76: Maybe I can use a combination of small and large numbers to cover the required sums.

Option 77: Perhaps I can include 1's to cover small sums and larger numbers to cover higher sums.

Option 78: Consider that including multiple 1's allows generating sums up to the number of 1's.

For example, including seven 1's allows generating sums from 1 to 7.

Option 79: Maybe I can include a certain number of 1's and then larger numbers to cover higher sums.

Option 80: Perhaps I can include enough 1's to cover sums up to a certain value, and then include larger numbers to cover higher sums up to n.

Option 81: Consider that including m 1's allows generating sums from 1 to m.

So, for example, including seven 1's allows generating sums from 1 to 7.

Option 82: Maybe I can set the number of 1's based on k and n.

Option 83: For example, if k is less than or equal to m, where m is the number of 1's, then set m to k-1, so that sums up to k-1 are covered, and k cannot be formed.

But then, how do I cover sums from k+1 to n?

Option 84: Perhaps I can include m 1's to cover sums from 1 to m, and then include larger numbers to cover sums from k+1 to n.

Option 85: For example, for n=9, k=3, include two 1's to cover sums 1 and 2, and then include numbers like 4,7 to cover sums from 4 to 9.

Wait, in the third test case, n=8, k=8, sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which covers sums from 1 to 7, excluding 8.

This fits the pattern.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, n=9, k=3, sequence is [7,1,4,1], which covers sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

Wait, but earlier I thought [1,1,1] sums to 3, but in the sequence [7,1,4,1], there are only two 1's, so [1,1]=2, and [1,1,1] is not possible, hence 3 is excluded.

So, perhaps in general, I can include enough 1's to cover sums up to k-1, and then include larger numbers to cover sums from k+1 to n.

Option 86: Yes, this seems promising.

So, for example:

- If k=3 and n=9, include two 1's to cover sums 1 and 2, and then include numbers like 4 and 7 to cover sums from 4 to 9.

- For n=8, k=8, include seven 1's to cover sums 1 to 7, excluding 8.

- For n=9, k=3, include two 1's to cover 1 and 2, and then include numbers like 4 and 7 to cover 4 to 9.

Option 87: So, in general, include m=ceil((k-1)/1)=k-1 ones to cover sums from 1 to m=k-1, and then include numbers that cover sums from k+1 to n.

But need to make sure that no subset sums to k.

Option 88: Wait, but if I include m=k-1 ones, their subsets can sum up to any value from 1 to m=k-1, which is good.

Then, to cover sums from k+1 to n, I can include numbers that, when added to the sums from the ones, cover the required sums.

Option 89: For example, if m=k-1 ones cover 1 to k-1, then to cover sums from k+1 to n, I can include numbers that are at least k+1 minus m.

Wait, this seems too vague.

Option 90: Perhaps I can include a number like k+1 - m, where m is the number of ones.

But I need a more systematic approach.

Option 91: Maybe I can use the fact that with m ones, I can generate sums from 1 to m, and then include a number x such that x + sums from ones cover higher sums.

Option 92: For example, if m=2 (for k=3), then sums from ones are 1 and 2.

Then, include a number like 4, so that 4 +0=4, 4+1=5, 4+2=6.

Then, include another number like 7, so 7 +0=7, 7+1=8, 7+2=9.

Thus, covering 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9, excluding 3.

This matches the fourth test case.

Option 93: So, generalizing, for k and n, set m = k-1, include m ones to cover 1 to m, and then include numbers that cover sums from k+1 to n without allowing any subset to sum to k.

Option 94: To cover sums from k+1 to n, I can include numbers that are at least k+1 - m.

Wait, perhaps I need to include numbers that are larger than k - m.

Option 95: Wait, perhaps I can include a number like k+1, then k+1 + sums from ones can cover from k+1 to k+1 + m.

Then, if necessary, include another number to cover higher sums.

Option 96: For example, for n=9, k=3, m=2 ones cover 1 and 2.

Then, include 4, which covers 4,5,6.

Include 7, which covers 7,8,9.

Thus, covering all from 1 to 9 except 3.

Option 97: Similarly, for n=6, k=1, include no ones (since k-1=0), and include [2,3,4,5,6] to cover 2 to 6, excluding 1.

Option 98: For n=8, k=8, include seven ones to cover 1 to 7, excluding 8.

Option 99: This seems to work.

Option 100: So, in code, for each test case, given n and k, set m = k-1, include m ones, and then include numbers starting from k+1 up to n.

But need to make sure that the total number of elements doesn't exceed 25.

Option 101: However, in the fourth test case, n=9, k=3, m=2, include two 1's, and then include 4 and 7, totaling four elements.

Option 102: Similarly, for n=8, k=8, m=7, include seven 1's.

Option 103: For n=2, k=2, m=1, include one 1.

Option 104: For n=6, k=1, m=0, include [2,3,4,5,6].

Option 105: So, in general, for each test case, set m = k-1, include m ones, and then include numbers starting from k+1 up to n.

But need to make sure that the sequence has at most 25 elements.

Option 106: However, if m = k-1 is large, and n is large, the total number of elements could exceed 25.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that a solution exists within 25 elements, so perhaps with this approach, the total number of elements won't exceed 25.

Option 107: Let's check for n=10^6 and k=1, m=0, include numbers from 2 to 10^6, but that's 999,999 elements, which is way more than 25.

Wait, but the problem says that a solution exists with at most 25 elements, so there must be a better way.

Option 108: Perhaps instead of including all numbers from k+1 to n, include a minimal set of numbers that can cover the required sums.

Option 109: For example, include powers of 2 starting from k+1 up to n.

But with n up to 10^6, and k up to 10^6, this might not be sufficient.

Option 110: Wait, but with 25 elements, including powers of 2 up to 2^24, which is over 16 million, which covers n=10^6.

Option 111: So, perhaps I can include m ones to cover sums from 1 to m=k-1, and then include powers of 2 starting from the smallest power that is greater than or equal to k+1 up to a point that covers n.

Option 112: For example, for n=9, k=3, m=2, include two 1's to cover 1 and 2, and then include 4 and 8 to cover up to 1+1+4+8=14, which covers up to 9.

Option 113: Similarly, for n=6, k=1, m=0, include powers of 2 starting from 2: 2,4, which covers up to 6.

Wait, but in the example, they included [2,3,4,5,6], which is more elements than necessary.

Option 114: So, perhaps I can optimize by including fewer elements, like powers of 2.

Option 115: For n=10^6, including powers of 2 up to 2^20 (which is 1,048,576) would be sufficient, and that's only 20 elements, plus m ones.

Option 116: But m ones can be up to 999,999 for k=1,000,000, which is not feasible.

Wait, but in the earlier test cases, for n=9, k=3, m=2, and for n=8, k=8, m=7.

So, m can be up to n-1, which is up to 999,999 for n=1,000,000 and k=1,000,000.

But the sequence can have at most 25 elements.

Option 117: So, perhaps including m ones is not efficient for large n and k close to n.

Option 118: Maybe I need a different approach.

Option 119: Perhaps I can limit the number of ones included and use larger numbers to cover the required sums.

Option 120: For example, include a certain number of small ones to cover low sums, and then include larger numbers to cover higher sums efficiently.

Option 121: But I need to ensure that the total number of elements doesn't exceed 25.

Option 122: Maybe
