Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's break it down. GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, which is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. So, gcd(a, b) is that number.

The condition is that a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b). In mathematical terms, that means (a + b) mod (b * gcd(a, b)) = 0.

Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can simplify this condition somehow.

Let me think about the properties involved here. Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, a can be expressed as d * k, where k is an integer, and b can be expressed as d * l, where l is an integer, and gcd(k, l) = 1, because d is the greatest common divisor.

So, a = d * k and b = d * l, with gcd(k, l) = 1.

Now, let's substitute these into the condition:

a + b = d * k + d * l = d(k + l)

And b * gcd(a, b) = d * l * d = d^2 * l

So, the condition becomes: d(k + l) should be divisible by d^2 * l.

In other words, d(k + l) / (d^2 * l) should be an integer.

Simplifying this fraction: (d(k + l)) / (d^2 * l) = (k + l) / (d * l)

So, (k + l) / (d * l) should be an integer. That means (k + l) must be divisible by d * l.

But wait, k and l are coprime, since gcd(k, l) = 1.

Let me see if I can find a relationship here.

Given that, maybe I can find a way to express this condition in terms of k and l, which might be easier to handle.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) directly.

Let's consider that a + b = m * b * gcd(a, b), where m is some positive integer.

But that seems a bit off, because a and b are positive integers, so a + b is at least 2, and b * gcd(a, b) could be less than or equal to a + b, depending on the values.

Wait, actually, for the divisibility condition, it's that b * gcd(a, b) divides a + b.

So, b * gcd(a, b) | a + b.

Which means there exists some integer k such that a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b).

I need to find all pairs (a, b) where this is true.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can look for patterns or find a way to iterate through possible values efficiently.

Given the constraints, n and m can be up to 2 * 10^6, and the sum of n and m across all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^6, with t being up to 10^4 test cases.

So, I need an efficient way to compute this, probably better than O(n * m) per test case, since that would be too slow.

Let's see if I can find a mathematical pattern or formula to compute the number of valid pairs directly.

Let me consider fixing b and then finding the possible a's that satisfy the condition for that b.

So, for a fixed b, I need to find the number of a in [1, n] such that a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

Given that gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, and b is fixed, maybe I can express gcd(a, b) in terms of b.

Let me denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, d divides b, so d is a divisor of b.

So, for a fixed b, d can be any divisor of b.

Given that, for each d that divides b, I can find the possible a's such that gcd(a, b) = d and a + b is divisible by b * d.

Wait, but if gcd(a, b) = d, then a must be a multiple of d, say a = d * k, where k is an integer such that gcd(k, b/d) = 1 (since gcd(a, b) = d).

So, a = d * k, with gcd(k, b/d) = 1.

Now, substitute a = d * k into the condition:

a + b = d * k + b.

But b is a multiple of d, since d divides b. So, b = d * m for some integer m.

Therefore, a + b = d * k + d * m = d(k + m).

And b * gcd(a, b) = b * d = d * m * d = d^2 * m.

So, the condition is that d(k + m) is divisible by d^2 * m.

Simplify: d(k + m) / (d^2 * m) = (k + m) / (d * m).

For this to be an integer, (k + m) must be divisible by d * m.

But k and m are such that gcd(k, m) = 1, because gcd(k, b/d) = gcd(k, m) = 1.

Wait, b = d * m, so m = b / d.

Therefore, gcd(k, m) = 1.

So, k and m are coprime.

Given that, k + m must be divisible by d * m.

But k and m are coprime, so k + m being divisible by d * m implies that d * m divides k + m.

But k is such that gcd(k, m) = 1, and k = a / d, with a ≤ n.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider the condition again: b * gcd(a, b) divides a + b.

I can write this as b * gcd(a, b) | a + b.

Let me denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, where gcd(a1, b1) = 1.

Substituting into the condition:

b * d | a + b ⇒ d * b1 * d | d * a1 + d * b1 ⇒ d^2 * b1 | d(a1 + b1) ⇒ d * b1 | a1 + b1.

Since a1 and b1 are coprime, and b1 divides a1 + b1, then b1 divides a1 + b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so b1 divides a1 + b1 implies b1 divides a1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, and b1 divides a1, so b1 must be 1.

Therefore, b1 = 1.

Recall that b = d * b1, so b = d * 1 = d.

Therefore, b = d = gcd(a, b).

So, for the condition to hold, b must be equal to gcd(a, b).

What does this mean?

It means that b divides a, because gcd(a, b) divides b.

Wait, but gcd(a, b) = b, so b divides a.

Therefore, a is a multiple of b.

So, the condition simplifies to: a is a multiple of b.

Wait, is that it?

Let me verify.

If a is a multiple of b, then gcd(a, b) = b, and a + b = a + b.

Then, b * gcd(a, b) = b * b = b^2.

So, we need b^2 to divide a + b.

But a is a multiple of b, so a = k * b for some integer k ≥ 1.

Then, a + b = k * b + b = b(k + 1).

So, b^2 divides b(k + 1) ⇒ b divides k + 1.

Therefore, k + 1 is divisible by b.

So, k ≡ -1 mod b.

Since k is a positive integer (because a = k * b ≥ b), and k ≡ -1 mod b.

But k must be at least 1, and k ≡ -1 mod b.

Wait, -1 mod b is equivalent to b - 1 mod b.

So, k ≡ b - 1 mod b.

Therefore, k = b * t + (b - 1) for some integer t ≥ 0.

Thus, a = k * b = [b * t + (b - 1)] * b = b^2 * t + b(b - 1).

But a must be ≤ n.

So, a = b^2 * t + b(b - 1) ≤ n.

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way to count the number of a's for each b.

Given that a must be a multiple of b, and a ≤ n, the number of possible a's for each b is floor(n / b).

But wait, not exactly. Because there's an additional condition that k ≡ b - 1 mod b.

Wait, earlier I had k ≡ b - 1 mod b.

But b - 1 mod b is just b - 1, since b - 1 < b.

So, k = b * t + (b - 1), for t ≥ 0.

Given that, a = b * k = b * (b * t + b - 1) = b^2 * t + b(b - 1).

But a ≤ n ⇒ b^2 * t + b(b - 1) ≤ n.

Solving for t: b^2 * t ≤ n - b(b - 1) ⇒ t ≤ floor[(n - b(b - 1)) / b^2].

But this seems complicated, and I need to make sure that n - b(b - 1) is non-negative.

Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me go back.

If a is a multiple of b, and a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b) = b^2, then a + b ≡ 0 mod b^2.

Given that a is a multiple of b, a = k * b, so a + b = k * b + b = b(k + 1).

So, b(k + 1) ≡ 0 mod b^2 ⇒ b(k + 1) is divisible by b^2 ⇒ k + 1 is divisible by b.

Therefore, k ≡ -1 mod b.

So, k = b * t - 1, for t ≥ 1.

Then, a = b * (b * t - 1) = b^2 * t - b.

But a must be ≥ b, since t ≥ 1.

And a ≤ n.

So, b^2 * t - b ≤ n ⇒ b^2 * t ≤ n + b ⇒ t ≤ floor[(n + b) / b^2].

Therefore, for each b, the number of valid a's is floor[(n + b) / b^2].

Wait, is that correct?

Let me verify with an example.

Take n = 10, m = 8.

For b = 1:

floor[(10 + 1)/1^2] = floor(11/1) = 11.

But a can be from 1 to 10, and a must be a multiple of 1, which it always is.

But according to earlier, k ≡ 0 mod 1, which is always true.

Wait, but in the note, for b=1, there are 10 possible a's: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But according to floor[(10 +1)/1^2] = 11, which is more than n.

Wait, maybe I need to take the minimum of floor[(n + b)/b^2] and floor(n/b).

Wait, but floor[(n + b)/b^2] should account for the condition k ≡ -1 mod b.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of valid a's is floor[(n + b)/b] - floor[n/b].

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's think differently.

Given that a must be a multiple of b, and k ≡ -1 mod b, where a = b * k.

So, k = t * b - 1, for t ≥ 1.

Then, a = b * (t * b - 1) = b^2 * t - b.

We need a ≤ n ⇒ b^2 * t - b ≤ n ⇒ b^2 * t ≤ n + b ⇒ t ≤ floor[(n + b)/b^2].

Similarly, a ≥ b, since t ≥ 1.

So, the number of valid a's for each b is floor[(n + b)/b^2].

But in the example with n=10, m=8, for b=1, floor[(10 +1)/1] = 11, but a can only go up to 10.

Wait, perhaps I need to take min(floor[(n + b)/b^2], floor[n/b]).

But in this case, floor[n/b] is floor[10/1] = 10, and floor[(10 +1)/1] = 11, so I should take 10.

Wait, but in general, I need to make sure that a ≤ n.

So, perhaps the correct formula is floor[(n + b)/b^2], but capped at floor[n/b].

Wait, but in the example, floor[(10 +1)/1] = 11, but floor[10/1] = 10, so I should take 10.

Similarly, for b=2:

floor[(10 +2)/4] = floor[12/4] = 3.

And floor[10/2] = 5.

But according to the note, for b=1: 10 a's, b=2: 2 a's (6 and 10), b=3: 1 a (9), b=4: 1 a (8), b=5:1 a (5), b=6:1 a (6), b=7:1 a (7), b=8:1 a (8).

Wait, but according to floor[(n + b)/b^2]:

For b=1: floor[11/1] =11, capped at floor[10/1]=10 →10

b=2: floor[12/4]=3, capped at floor[10/2]=5 →3

But in the note, for b=2, there are 2 a's:6 and 10.

But according to this, it's 3.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So maybe this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid a's for each b is floor[(n + b)/b] - floor[n/b].

Wait, let's check:

For b=1: floor[(10 +1)/1] - floor[10/1] =11 -10=1, but in reality, there are 10 a's.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor[(n + b -1)/b] - floor[(b -1)/b].

Wait, that might not make sense.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that a must be of the form a = b * k - b, where k is an integer such that a ≥ b.

Wait, earlier I had a = b^2 * t - b, but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that a = b * (t * b -1), but that might not cover all cases.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider iterating over b from 1 to m, and for each b, find the number of a in [1, n] such that a is a multiple of b and (a + b) is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

But since we've established that gcd(a, b) = b, because b divides a, then the condition simplifies to b^2 divides a + b.

Given that a is a multiple of b, a = c * b, so a + b = b(c +1), and we need b^2 divides b(c +1), which simplifies to b divides c +1.

Therefore, c ≡ -1 mod b.

So, c = b * k -1 for some integer k ≥1.

Then, a = b * c = b*(b * k -1) = b^2 * k - b.

We need a ≤ n, so b^2 * k - b ≤ n ⇒ b^2 * k ≤ n + b ⇒ k ≤ floor[(n + b)/b^2].

Therefore, for each b, the number of valid a's is floor[(n + b)/b^2], but we need to ensure that a = b^2 * k - b ≥ b, which is satisfied for k ≥1.

But in the earlier example with n=10, m=8, for b=2:

floor[(10 +2)/4] = floor[12/4] =3.

But according to the note, there are only 2 a's:6 and 10.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me calculate for b=2:

k can be 1,2,3.

Then a = 4*1 -2=2, which is less than or equal to 10.

a=4*2 -2=6 ≤10.

a=4*3 -2=10 ≤10.

So, a=2,6,10.

But in the note, only a=6 and a=10 are listed for b=2.

Wait, maybe a=2 is not included because it doesn't satisfy the original condition.

Wait, let's check a=2, b=2.

a + b =4, b * gcd(a,b)=2*2=4, which divides 4, so it should be included.

But in the note, for b=2, only a=6 and a=10 are mentioned.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the note.

Looking back, in the fourth test case, the pairs are:

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

Wait, for b=2, a=2,6,10 should all be included.

Maybe the note is incomplete.

Similarly, for b=1, a=1 to 10.

For b=2, a=2,6,10.

For b=3, a=3,9.

For b=4, a=4,8.

For b=5, a=5.

For b=6, a=6.

For b=7, a=7.

For b=8, a=8.

So, total pairs are:

b=1:10 a's

b=2:3 a's

b=3:2 a's

b=4:2 a's

b=5:1 a

b=6:1 a

b=7:1 a

b=8:1 a

Total:10+3+2+2+1+1+1+1=21, but in the note, it's 14.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, in the note, it shows 14 pairs, but according to this, it's 21.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the note.

Wait, in the note, it shows (1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

That's 14 pairs.

But according to my earlier calculation, for b=1, a=1 to10 (10 pairs), b=2, a=2,6,10 (3 pairs), total already 13, plus b=3,a=3,9 (2 pairs), but in the note, only (6,2),(6,3),(10,2) for b=2, and (3,1),(9,1) for b=3.

Wait, but in the note, for b=2, only a=6 and a=10 are listed, not a=2.

Wait, perhaps a=2 is not included because b=2 and a=2, but in the note, (2,2) is included.

Wait, let's see:

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

So, for b=1: a=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (10 pairs)

b=2: a=2,6,10 (3 pairs)

b=3: a=3,6,9 (but in the note, only (6,3) is listed, but according to my earlier logic, a=3,6,9 should all be included)

Wait, but for b=3:

a=3: a+b=6, b*gcd(a,b)=3*gcd(3,3)=3*3=9, 6 is not divisible by 9 ⇒ invalid

a=6: a+b=9, b*gcd(a,b)=3*gcd(6,3)=3*3=9, 9 is divisible by 9 ⇒ valid

a=9: a+b=12, b*gcd(a,b)=3*gcd(9,3)=3*3=9, 12 is not divisible by 9 ⇒ invalid

So, only a=6 for b=3 is valid.

Similarly, for b=4:

a=4: a+b=8, b*gcd(a,b)=4*gcd(4,4)=4*4=16, 8 is not divisible by 16 ⇒ invalid

a=8: a+b=12, b*gcd(a,b)=4*gcd(8,4)=4*4=16, 12 is not divisible by 16 ⇒ invalid

Wait, but in the note, (4,1),(8,1),(10,2) are included, but according to this, for b=4, there are no valid a's.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the note.

Wait, in the note, it's listed as:

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

So, for b=1: a=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

for b=2: a=2,6,10

for b=3: a=6

for b=4: a=4,8

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, for b=4, no a's should be valid, but in the note, (4,1),(8,1) are listed, but these are for b=1, not b=4.

Wait, no, (4,1) is b=1, a=4.

Wait, I think there's confusion in reading the note.

The note says:

In the fourth test case, (1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2) satisfy the conditions.

So, in this list, for each pair (a,b), b is the second element.

So, for b=1: a=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 →10 pairs

b=2: a=2,6,10 →3 pairs

b=3: a=6 →1 pair

b=4: no pairs listed, but (4,1) is for b=1

Wait, I think I misread the note earlier.

So, in the note, for b=1: a=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

b=2: a=2,6,10

b=3: a=6

b=4: no a's

b=5: a=5

b=6: a=6

b=7: a=7

b=8: a=8

Total:10 +3 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =18, but the note says 14.

Wait, perhaps some pairs are missing in my interpretation.

Wait, in the note, only (1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

So, for b=1: a=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 →10 pairs

b=2: a=2,6,10 →3 pairs

b=3: a=6 →1 pair

Total:14 pairs.

So, in this case, for b=4, no valid a's, contrary to my earlier calculation.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, for b=4, floor[(10 +4)/16]=floor[14/16]=0, but according to the note, there are no valid a's for b=4.

Wait, but earlier for b=2, floor[(10 +2)/4]=3, but in reality, only a=6 and a=10 are valid, which corresponds to k=2 and k=3.

Wait, because for k=1, a=4*1 -2=2, but 2 +2=4, and b*gcd(a,b)=2*gcd(2,2)=4, which divides 4, so it should be valid.

But in the note, only a=6 and a=10 are listed for b=2.

Wait, perhaps the note is incorrect, or perhaps I misread it.

Looking back, in the note, for b=2, a=2,6,10 should all be valid, but perhaps in the note, only a=6 and a=10 are listed because a=2 is excluded for some reason.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the note.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me double-check the condition.

Given that a must be a multiple of b, and a + b must be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

But since gcd(a, b) = b, because b divides a.

So, a + b must be divisible by b * b = b^2.

Given that a is a multiple of b, a = c * b.

So, a + b = c * b + b = b(c +1).

For b(c +1) to be divisible by b^2, c +1 must be divisible by b.

Therefore, c ≡ -1 mod b.

So, c = b * k -1 for k ≥1.

Then, a = b * c = b*(b * k -1) = b^2 * k - b.

We need a ≤ n ⇒ b^2 * k - b ≤ n ⇒ b^2 * k ≤ n + b ⇒ k ≤ floor[(n + b)/b^2].

So, for b=2, n=10, floor[(10 +2)/4]=floor[12/4]=3.

Thus, k=1,2,3.

Then, a=4*1 -2=2, a=4*2 -2=6, a=4*3 -2=10.

All of these should be valid.

But in the note, for b=2, a=2,6,10 are all included, but perhaps in the note, only a=6 and a=10 are listed because a=2 is invalid for some reason.

Wait, but according to the condition, a=2 should be valid for b=2.

Maybe there's a mistake in the note.

Alternatively, perhaps the note only lists unique a's, but that doesn't make sense because a=2 is valid for b=2.

This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to ensure that a ≤ n and b ≤ m, and count only those pairs.

But in this case, a=2 is ≤10 and b=2 is ≤8, so it should be included.

Wait, perhaps the note is missing a=2 for b=2.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that for b=2, a=2 is already included in b=1, but that doesn't make sense because b is different.

I'm getting confused here.

Maybe I need to accept that my formula overcounts by including a=2 for b=2, but according to the note, it's not included, so perhaps there's an error in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to adjust the formula to floor[(n + b)/b^2] -1.

Wait, for b=2, floor[(10 +2)/4]=3, but only 2 a's are valid in the note, so maybe it's floor[(n + b)/b^2] -1.

Then, for b=2:3-1=2, which matches the note.

For b=1: floor[(10 +1)/1]=11 -1=10, which matches.

For b=3: floor[(10 +3)/9]=floor[13/9]=1, which should correspond to a=6, matching the note.

For b=4: floor[(10 +4)/16]=floor[14/16]=0, which matches the note.

So, perhaps the correct formula is floor[(n + b)/b^2] -1, but only if floor[(n + b)/b^2] ≥1.

Wait, for b=3: floor[(10 +3)/9]=1, 1-1=0, but according to the note, a=6 is valid, which corresponds to k=1: a=9*1 -3=6.

Wait, so a=6 should be included, but according to floor[(n + b)/b^2] -1=1-1=0, which would exclude it.

That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor[(n + b)/b^2], but with adjustments.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to iterate over b from 1 to m, and for each b, iterate over k from 1 to floor[(n + b)/b^2], compute a = b^2 * k - b, and count how many such a's are ≤n.

But this seems inefficient for large n and m.

Given the constraints, with n and m up to 2*10^6 per test case, and t up to 10^4, I need a more efficient approach.

Perhaps I can precompute some values or find a mathematical formula that allows me to compute the total number of valid pairs across all test cases efficiently.

Let me consider that for each b, the number of valid a's is floor[(n + b)/b^2] - some adjustment.

But I'm stuck on getting the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible b and k to find a, but that would be too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible b, and for each b, compute how many k's satisfy a = b^2 * k - b ≤ n, with k ≥1.

So, k ≤ floor[(n + b)/b^2].

Then, the number of valid a's for each b is floor[(n + b)/b^2].

But earlier, this overcounts in some cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to iterate over possible b and a, but that's O(n * m), which is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible b, and for each b, find the number of a's that are multiples of b and satisfy the condition.

Wait, but that's what I tried earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the condition a + b ≡0 mod (b * gcd(a,b)), and since gcd(a,b)=b, it's a + b ≡0 mod b^2.

So, a ≡ -b mod b^2.

Given that a is a multiple of b, a = c * b, so c * b ≡ -b mod b^2 ⇒ c ≡ -1 mod b.

Therefore, c = b * k -1 for k ≥1.

Then, a = b * c = b*(b * k -1) = b^2 * k - b.

We need a ≤n ⇒ b^2 * k - b ≤n ⇒ k ≤ floor[(n + b)/b^2].

So, for each b, the number of valid a's is floor[(n + b)/b^2].

But earlier, this seemed to overcount in some cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is floor[(n + b)/b^2] - floor[b/b^2], but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps floor[(n + b)/b^2] -1, but that doesn't work for all cases.

This is tricky.

Maybe I need to accept that my formula is slightly off and try to adjust it based on the example.

In the example with n=10, m=8, total pairs should be 14.

According to my formula:

sum floor[(n + b)/b^2] for b from 1 to m.

Compute:

b=1: floor[11/1]=11

b=2: floor[12/4]=3

b=3: floor[13/9]=1

b=4: floor[14/16]=0

b=5: floor[15/25]=0

b=6: floor[16/36]=0

b=7: floor[17/49]=0

b=8: floor[18/64]=0

Total:11 +3 +1 =15, but according to the note, it should be 14.

So, it's overcounting by 1.

Similarly, for n=3, m=5, expected output is 4.

Compute:

b=1: floor[4/1]=4

b=2: floor[5/4]=1

b=3: floor[6/9]=0

b=4: floor[7/16]=0

b=5: floor[8/25]=0

Total:4 +1=5, but expected is 4, so overcounting by 1.

Another test case: n=1, m=1, expected output 1.

Compute:

b=1: floor[2/1]=2, but a=1 is valid, so overcounting by1.

Wait, perhaps the formula is floor[(n + b)/b^2] -1, but only if b^2 <= n + b.

For b=1: floor[11/1]-1=10, but expected is10.

Wait, no, for n=10, m=8, it would be floor[11/1]-1=10, floor[12/4]-1=2, floor[13/9]-1=0, etc., total 10 +2 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0=12, but expected is14.

No, that doesn't match.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that my approach is incorrect and look for an alternative way.

Let me consider that a must be a multiple of b, and a + b must be divisible by b * gcd(a,b) = b^2.

So, a + b ≡0 mod b^2 ⇒ a ≡ -b mod b^2.

Given that a is a multiple of b, a = c * b, so c * b ≡ -b mod b^2 ⇒ c ≡ -1 mod b.

Therefore, c = k * b -1 for k ≥1.

Then, a = b * c = b*(k * b -1) = b^2 * k - b.

We need a ≤n ⇒ b^2 * k - b ≤n ⇒ k ≤ floor[(n + b)/b^2].

So, for each b, the number of valid a's is floor[(n + b)/b^2].

But according to the example, this overcounts by1.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is floor[(n + b)/b^2] - floor[b/b^2], but floor[b/b^2] is0 for b ≥2, and1 for b=1.

So, for b=1: floor[11/1] -1=10

b=2: floor[12/4] -0=3

b=3: floor[13/9] -0=1

b=4: floor[14/16] -0=0

Total:10 +3 +1=14, which matches the example.

Similarly, for n=3, m=5:

b=1: floor[4/1]-1=3

b=2: floor[6/4]-0=1

b=3: floor[8/9]-0=0

b=4: floor[9/16]-0=0

b=5: floor[10/25]-0=0

Total:3 +1=4, which matches the example.

For n=1, m=1:

b=1: floor[2/1]-1=1, which matches the expected output of1.

So, the adjusted formula seems to work.

Therefore, for each b from1 to m, the number of valid a's is floor[(n + b)/b^2] - floor[b/b^2].

For b=1, subtract1, for b≥2, subtract0.

Wait, but floor[b/b^2] is floor[1/b], which is1 for b=1, and0 for b≥2.

So, it works.

Therefore, the total number of valid pairs is sum over b from1 to m of floor[(n + b)/b^2] - floor[1/b].

Since floor[1/b] is1 for b=1 and0 elsewhere, this simplifies to floor[(n + b)/b^2] -1 for b=1, and floor[(n + b)/b^2] for b≥2.

Therefore, the total number of valid pairs is:

sum_{b=1}^m floor[(n + b)/b^2] -1

Wait, no, for b=1, it's floor[(n +1)/1] -1, and for b≥2, it's floor[(n + b)/b^2].

So, it's sum_{b=1}^m floor[(n + b)/b^2] - delta_{b,1}, where delta_{b,1} is1 if b=1, else0.

Alternatively, sum_{b=1}^m floor[(n + b)/b^2] -1 for b=1, and sum_{b=2}^m floor[(n + b)/b^2].

This seems manageable.

Given that, I can implement this formula to compute the total number of valid pairs for each test case.

Given the constraints, with t up to10^4 and n and m up to2*10^6, with the sum of n and m across all test cases not exceeding2*10^6, this should be efficient enough.

I need to process t test cases, each with n and m up to2*10^6, but the total sum of n and m across all test cases is up to2*10^6.

Therefore, I can iterate over each test case, compute the sum as described, and output the result.

To optimize, I can iterate over b from1 to m, compute floor[(n + b)/b^2], and subtract1 if b=1.

Given that m can be up to2*10^6, and t up to10^4, but with the sum of m across all test cases up to2*10^6, this should be acceptable.

Alternatively, I can sort the test cases and process them in a way that minimizes the total computation time.

But given time constraints, iterating over each test case separately should be fine.

Therefore, my plan is:

- Read the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Initialize a counter to0.

- For b from1 to m:

- If b==1:

- Add floor[(n +1)/1] -1 to the counter.

- Else:

- Add floor[(n + b)/b^2] to the counter.

- Output the counter.

This should correctly compute the number of valid pairs for each test case.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.
