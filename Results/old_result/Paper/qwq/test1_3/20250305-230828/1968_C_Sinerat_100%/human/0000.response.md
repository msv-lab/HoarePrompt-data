Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, up to x_n, and I need to find an array a_1 to a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

My task is to find such an array a, given x. And there can be multiple possible a arrays, but I just need to find any one that satisfies the conditions.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

And the output is a = [3, 5, 4, 9]

Let's verify:

a2 % a1 = 5 % 3 = 2, which matches x2.

a3 % a2 = 4 % 5 = 4, matches x3.

a4 % a3 = 9 % 4 = 1, matches x4.

Looks good.

Another test case:

n = 3

x = [1, 1]

a = [2, 5, 11]

Check:

5 % 2 = 1, matches x2.

11 % 5 = 1, matches x3.

Alright, seems correct.

Now, how to approach finding such an array a?

I need to choose a1, a2, ..., an such that for each i from 2 to n, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

I need to ensure that a_i is between 1 and 10^9.

One way to approach this is to choose a1 arbitrarily within the range, and then choose each subsequent a_i based on a_{i-1} and x_i.

But I need to make sure that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Given that, one way is to set a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is an integer such that a_i is within the range.

But I need to choose k appropriately to ensure that a_i doesn't exceed 10^9.

Alternatively, to make it simple, I can choose a1, and then set a2 = a1 + x1, a3 = a2 + x2, and so on.

Wait, but a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

If a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, then a_i % a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_i) % a_{i-1} = x_i % a_{i-1}.

But since x_i < a_{i-1} (because x_i is the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}), this should work as long as x_i < a_{i-1}.

But in the example, a1 is 3, and x1 is 2, which is less than a1.

In the second test case, a1 is 2, x1 is 1, which is less than a1.

So, this seems to work when x_i < a_{i-1}.

But what if x_i >= a_{i-1}? Is that possible?

According to the problem, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, so as long as a_{i-1} is chosen larger than x_i, it should be fine.

But I need to make sure that a_{i-1} > x_i for all i.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says 1 <= x_i <= 500, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

So, if I choose a1 > x1, and a2 > x2, and so on, it should work.

But what if x_i is larger than a_{i-1}? That would mean a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, and x_i >= a_{i-1}, which isn't possible because the remainder must be less than the divisor.

Wait, but the problem says 1 <= x_i <= 500, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and n can be up to 500.

So, as long as a_{i-1} > x_i, it should be fine.

But in the program given, a1 is set to 1000, which is greater than x1 (since x1 <= 500), and then each a_i is set to a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}.

Wait, but a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} might not necessarily be greater than x_i.

Wait, but in the first test case, a1=3, x1=2, a2=5, x2=4, a3=9, x3=1.

Wait, in this case, a2=5, x2=4, which is less than a2=5, so a3=9, x3=1, which is less than a3=9.

So, in this approach, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}, and since a_{i-1} > x_{i-1}, a_i > x_{i-1}, and then for the next step, a_{i} > x_{i}, and so on.

Wait, but in this approach, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}, and since a_{i-1} > x_{i-1}, a_i > x_{i-1}, but x_i could be up to 500, and a_{i-1} could be larger than that.

But in the program, a1 is set to 1 for all test cases, which is not greater than x1 if x1 >=1.

Wait, no, in the program, a1 is set to 1000, which is greater than x1 since x1 <=500.

Wait, but in the example, a1=3, which is greater than x1=2.

But in the program, a1 is set to 1000, which is way larger than any x_i.

So, perhaps choosing a1 to be larger than the maximum x_i is a safe choice.

But in the example, a1=3, which is larger than x1=2, and a2=5, which is larger than x2=4, and a3=9, which is larger than x3=1.

So, as long as a_{i-1} > x_{i-1}, then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} will be larger than x_{i-1}, and if x_i < a_i, it should work.

But I need to make sure that for all i, a_{i-1} > x_{i-1}.

Given that a1 is chosen larger than x1, and a2 = a1 + x1, which is larger than x1, and x2 <=500, which is less than a2, and so on.

So, choosing a1 sufficiently large, say a1=1000, which is larger than any x_i, and then setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}, ensures that a_i > x_{i-1}, and since x_i <=500, and a_i increases by x_{i-1}, which is less than a_{i-1}, it should remain larger than x_i.

Wait, but x_i can be up to 500, and a_i starts at 1000 and increases by up to 500 each time, so a_i will always be at least 1000, which is larger than x_i (up to 500), so it should be fine.

But let's check with an example where x_i is increasing.

Suppose n=3, x=[300, 400].

Then, a1=1000, a2=1000 + 300 =1300, a3=1300 +400=1700.

Then, a2 % a1 =1300 %1000=300, which matches x2.

a3 % a2=1700%1300=400, which matches x3.

Good.

Another example: n=4, x=[100, 200, 50].

a1=1000, a2=1000+100=1100, a3=1100+200=1300, a4=1300+50=1350.

Then, a2%a1=1100%1000=100, matches x2.

a3%a2=1300%1100=200, matches x3.

a4%a3=1350%1300=50, matches x4.

Perfect.

So, this approach seems to work.

But is there any case where this might fail?

Suppose n=2, x=[500].

Set a1=1000, a2=1000+500=1500.

Then, a2%a1=1500%1000=500, which matches x2.

Seems fine.

Another case: n=2, x=[500], a1=501, a2=501+500=1001.

Then, a2%a1=1001%501=1, which is not equal to x2=500.

Wait, this is a problem.

Wait, no, according to the problem, x_i <=500, and a_i <=10^9.

But in this case, a1=501, x1=500, a2=501+500=1001.

Then, a2%a1=1001%501=1, which is not equal to x2=500.

So, this approach fails here.

Wait, but in the program, a1 is set to 1000, which is larger than x1=500, so a2=1000+500=1500, and 1500%1000=500, which matches x2.

So, in this case, it works.

But if a1=501, which is larger than x1=500, a2=501+500=1001, but 1001%501=1, not 500.

So, the approach fails here.

Hmm.

So, the approach of setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} only works if a_{i-1} > x_{i-1}.

In the case where a_{i-1} <= x_{i-1}, it doesn't work.

Wait, but in the problem constraints, x_i <=500, and a_i <=10^9.

So, if I set a1 > x1, which is true in the program where a1=1000 and x1<=500, then a1 > x1.

Then, a2 = a1 + x1, which is larger than x1, and x2 <=500, so a2 > x2.

And so on.

So, in the example where a1=501 and x1=500, a2=501+500=1001, but 1001%501=1, not 500.

So, this approach fails in this case.

But in the program, a1=1000, which is larger than x1=500, and a2=1000+500=1500, 1500%1000=500, which works.

So, perhaps as long as a1 is sufficiently larger than x1, it works.

But in the case where a1=501 and x1=500, a2=501+500=1001, but 1001%501=1, not 500.

So, the approach fails.

Wait, but according to the problem constraints, x_i <=500, and a_i <=10^9.

So, to make sure that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, I need to ensure that a_i = k*a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is an integer such that a_i <=10^9.

But in the approach of setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, it works only if a_{i-1} > x_i.

Otherwise, a_i % a_{i-1} != x_i.

So, this approach is not always correct.

Wait, but in the program, a1 is set to 1000, which is larger than x1 (since x1 <=500), and then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}, which ensures that a_i > x_{i-1}, but as seen in the earlier example, it can fail when a_{i-1} <= x_{i-1}.

But in this problem, since a1 > x1, and a2 = a1 + x1, which is larger than x1, and x2 <=500, which is less than a2, and so on, it might work.

But in the case where a1=501 and x1=500, a2=501+500=1001, but 1001%501=1, not 500.

So, it fails.

Hence, the approach in the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

But in the example given in the problem, a1=3, x1=2, a2=5, x2=4, a3=9, x3=1.

Here, a2=5, x2=4, which is less than a2=5, and a3=9, x3=1, which is less than a3=9.

So, in this case, it works.

But in the case where a_{i-1} <= x_{i-1}, it fails.

Wait, but according to the problem constraints, x_i <=500, and a_i <=10^9, so if a1 is set to a sufficiently large number, say 1000, which is larger than x1, and then a2=a1 + x1, which is larger than x1, and so on, it should work.

But as seen in the earlier counterexample, when a1=501 and x1=500, a2=501+500=1001, but 1001%501=1, not 500.

So, the approach fails in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

To make it correct, I need to ensure that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

One way to do this is to set a1 to a value larger than any x_i, say a1=10^9, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}.

But as seen in the counterexample, this doesn't always work.

Another approach is to set a1 to x1 +1, but that might not work if x1 is close to a1.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set a1 to x1 +1, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}.

But in the counterexample, a1=501, x1=500, a2=501+500=1001, but 1001%501=1, not 500.

So, it still fails.

Wait, maybe I need to set a1 to x1, but then a2 = a1 + x1 = x1 + x1 = 2*x1, and 2*x1 % x1 =0, which is not equal to x2 unless x2=0.

But x_i can be up to 500, so x2=0 is possible, but not in general.

So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps set a1 to x1 + x2 + ... + x_{n-1}, but that might not work either.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set a1 to x1, a2 to x2 + a1, a3 to x3 + a2, and so on.

Wait, that's similar to the initial approach, but in the counterexample, it fails.

Alternatively, perhaps set a1 to a value larger than all x_i, say a1=10^9, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}.

But in the counterexample, a1=501, x1=500, a2=501+500=1001, but 1001%501=1, not 500.

So, it still fails.

Wait, perhaps I need to set a_i = k*a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is chosen such that a_i <=10^9.

But how to choose k?

Well, k can be any integer such that a_i <=10^9.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps set a1 to x1 +1, a2 to a1 + x1, a3 to a2 + x2, and so on.

But in the counterexample, a1=501, x1=500, a2=501+500=1001, but 1001%501=1, not 500.

So, still doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps set a1 to x1 + x2 + ... + xn, but that might not work either.

Alternatively, perhaps set a1 to x1, a2 to x2 + a1, a3 to x3 + a2, and so on.

But again, in the counterexample, it fails.

Wait, perhaps I need to set a1 to a value such that a1 > x1, a2 = a1 + x1, a3 = a2 + x2, and so on, ensuring that a_{i-1} > x_{i-1} for all i.

But in the counterexample, a1=501 > x1=500, but a2=501+500=1001, and 1001%501=1, not 500.

So, it still fails.

Wait, why does this happen?

Because 1001 divided by 501 is 2 with a remainder of 1.

But I need the remainder to be 500.

Wait, perhaps I need to set a2 = a1 + x1 + a1, or something else.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps set a2 = a1 * k + x1, where k is an integer such that a2 <=10^9.

But choosing k appropriately might be tricky.

Wait, perhaps set a2 = a1 + m * a1, where m is such that a2 % a1 = x1.

Wait, but a2 % a1 is always less than a1, so if x1 < a1, it should be possible.

But in the counterexample, x1=500, a1=501, so a2 % 501 =500.

But 501 +500=1001, 1001%501=1, not 500.

So, perhaps I need to set a2 = a1 + k * a1 + x1, for some integer k.

Wait, let's think about it.

I need a2 such that a2 % a1 =x1.

Which means a2 = m * a1 + x1, for some integer m, where m * a1 + x1 <=10^9.

So, the general solution is a2 = m * a1 + x1, for integer m.

To minimize a2, choose m=1, so a2 = a1 + x1.

But in the counterexample, a1=501, x1=500, a2=501+500=1001, but 1001%501=1, not 500.

Wait, but according to the formula, a2 % a1 should be x1.

But in this case, it's not.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, no, the formula a2 = m * a1 + x1 should give a2 % a1 =x1.

Because (m * a1 + x1) % a1 = (m * a1) % a1 + x1 % a1 = 0 + x1 =x1.

Wait, but in the counterexample, a2=1001, a1=501, 1001 %501=1001 - 2*501=1001-1002=-1, which is not 500.

Wait, but according to modulo operation, 1001 %501 should be 1001 - 2*501=1001-1002=-1, but modulo is usually defined to be non-negative, so -1 +501=500.

Wait, in Python, 1001 %501 is indeed 500, because Python's modulo operation results in a remainder having the same sign as the divisor.

So, 1001 %501 =500.

So, in this case, a2=1001 %501=500, which matches x1=500.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought it was 1, but actually, it's 500.

Wait, let me calculate again.

1001 divided by 501 is 1001 /501 =2 times (since 2*501=1002), subtract 1002 from 1001 gives -1, but since remainder can't be negative, add 501 to -1 to get 500.

So, 1001 %501=500.

Hence, a2=1001 %501=500, which matches x1=500.

So, in this case, it actually works.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1, but it's actually 500.

So, the approach works.

Therefore, the approach in the program is correct.

Hence, the program is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I mistakenly thought that 1001%501=1, but actually, it's 500.

So, the approach works.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find an array \( a \) such that for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), the condition \( x_i = a_i \% a_{i-1} \) holds, given the constraints on the values of \( a \) and \( x \).

## Approach

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We choose \( a_1 \) to be a value larger than any \( x_i \). In this solution, \( a_1 \) is set to 1000, which is greater than the maximum value of \( x_i \) (which is 500 as per the problem constraints).

2. **Building the Array**:
   - For each subsequent element \( a_i \) (from \( i = 2 \) to \( n \)), we set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \).
   - This ensures that \( a_i \% a_{i-1} = x_{i-1} \), because \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \), and thus the remainder when \( a_i \) is divided by \( a_{
