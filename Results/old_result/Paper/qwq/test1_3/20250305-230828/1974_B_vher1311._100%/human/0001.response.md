Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Polycarp has a string made up of lowercase Latin letters, and he encodes it using a specific algorithm. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string 'r' which consists of all the distinct letters from the original string 's', sorted in alphabetical order. Then, each character in 's' is replaced by its symmetric counterpart from 'r'. For example, the first character of 'r' is replaced by the last character of 'r', the second by the second last, and so on.

Given that, I need to write a program that decodes an encoded string back to the original string 's'. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an encoded string 'b', and I need to output the original string 's' for each case.

First, I need to understand the encoding process thoroughly to reverse it correctly. Let's break it down:

1. **Construct the auxiliary string 'r':**

- 'r' is made up of unique characters from 's', sorted alphabetically.

- For example, if 's' is "codeforces", then 'r' is "cdefors".

2. **Encoding process:**

- Each character in 's' is replaced by its symmetric counterpart from 'r'.

- In "codeforces", 'c' is replaced by 's', 'o' by 'e', 'd' by 'r', 'e' by 'o', 'f' by 'f', 'o' by 'e', 'r' by 'd', 'c' by 's', 'e' by 'o', and 's' by 'c'.

- So, the encoded string 'b' is "serofedsoc".

Now, to decode 'b' back to 's', I need to reverse this process. Given 'b' and 'r', I should be able to map each character in 'b' back to its original character in 's'.

Wait, but 'r' is not directly given in the input. I need to reconstruct 'r' from 'b' because 'b' was encoded using 'r' constructed from 's'. But 's' is what I'm trying to find. This seems a bit circular.

Let me think differently. Since 'r' is made up of unique sorted characters from 's', and 'b' is 's' encoded using 'r', I need a way to map characters from 'b' back to 's' based on the symmetry in 'r'.

Given that 'r' is sorted, and the mapping is symmetric, I can probably reconstruct 'r' from 'b' because 'b' should also contain characters that correspond to 'r' in a symmetric way.

Wait, no. 'b' is encoded from 's' using 'r', but 'r' is derived from 's'. So, to decode 'b', I need to first reconstruct 'r' from 'b', and then use the symmetric mapping to get back to 's'.

Let me try with the example:

Encoded 'b': "serofedsoc"

First, find 'r' from 'b'. Since 'r' is sorted unique characters from 's', and 'b' is encoded from 's' using 'r', the unique characters in 'b' should be the same as in 's', just mapped symmetrically.

So, unique characters in 'b' are 's', 'e', 'r', 'o', 'f', 'd', 'c'. Sorting them gives 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's', which is "cdefors" — matches the example.

Now, the mapping is:

'c' -> 's'

'd' -> 'r'

'e' -> 'o'

'f' -> 'f'

'o' -> 'e'

'r' -> 'd'

's' -> 'c'

So, to decode, I need a mapping from 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', etc., which is the reverse of the encoding mapping.

Wait, no. To decode, I need to map from 'b' back to 's', which means I need the reverse mapping of the encoding.

In other words, if in encoding 'c' is replaced by 's', then in decoding 's' should be replaced back by 'c'.

So, the decoding mapping is the inverse of the encoding mapping.

Therefore, I can construct 'r' from the unique sorted characters of 'b', then create a mapping from the symmetric positions in 'r' to the original positions.

Wait, but 'r' is constructed from 's', not 'b'. However, since 'b' is encoded from 's' using 'r', the unique characters in 'b' should be the same as in 's', just mapped symmetrically.

Given that, the unique sorted characters in 'b' should be the same as 'r'.

So, in the decoding process:

1. **Reconstruct 'r':**

- Get all unique characters in 'b', sort them to get 'r'.

2. **Create the decoding mapping:**

- For each character in 'r', determine its symmetric counterpart in 'r'.

- Since encoding maps each character in 's' to its symmetric counterpart in 'r', decoding should map each character in 'b' back to its original character in 's'.

- Therefore, the decoding mapping is from the symmetric character in 'r' back to the original character in 'r'.

Let me illustrate with the example:

'r' = "cdefors"

Symmetric mapping:

'c' <-> 's'

'd' <-> 'r'

'e' <-> 'o'

'f' <-> 'f'

's' <-> 'c'

'r' <-> 'd'

'o' <-> 'e'

So, decoding mapping is:

's' -> 'c'

'r' -> 'd'

'e' -> 'o'

'f' -> 'f'

'c' -> 's'

'd' -> 'r'

'o' -> 'e'

Now, apply this mapping to 'b' = "serofedsoc":

's' -> 'c'

'e' -> 'o'

'r' -> 'd'

'o' -> 'e'

'f' -> 'f'

'e' -> 'o'

'd' -> 'r'

's' -> 'c'

'o' -> 'e'

'c' -> 's'

Which gives "codeforces" — matches the original 's'.

Perfect. So, the approach is:

- For each test case:

- Read 'n' and 'b'.

- Get all unique characters in 'b', sort them to get 'r'.

- Create a mapping where each character in 'r' is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in 'r'.

- Then, for each character in 'b', map it back to the original character in 's' using this symmetric mapping.

- Output the decoded string.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

The program is:

```python

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

index = 0

t = int(data[index])

index += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(data[index])

index += 1

b = data[index]

index += 1

results.append(func_1(b))

print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(encoded):

r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))

mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}

return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))

```

Let's analyze this step by step.

1. **Reading input:**

- Read all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.

- Split the input into a list of strings, stored in `data`.

- Initialize `index` to 0.

- Read the number of test cases `t` from `data[index]` and increment `index`.

- Initialize an empty list `results` to store the results of each test case.

2. **Processing each test case:**

- For each test case:

- Read `n` (length of encoded string) from `data[index]` and increment `index`.

- Read the encoded string `b` from `data[index]` and increment `index`.

- Call `func_1(b)` to decode the string and append the result to `results`.

- After processing all test cases, print the results joined by newline.

3. **Decoding function `func_1`:**

- `r` is constructed by getting the unique characters from `encoded`, sorting them.

- Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

- Decode `encoded` by replacing each character with its corresponding character in the mapping.

This seems to align with the approach I outlined earlier.

Let's verify with the example:

Encoded 'b': "serofedsoc"

Unique characters: 's', 'e', 'r', 'o', 'f', 'd', 'c' sorted to "cdefors"

Mapping:

'c' <-> 's'

'd' <-> 'r'

'e' <-> 'o'

'f' <-> 'f'

'o' <-> 'e'

'r' <-> 'd'

's' <-> 'c'

Decoding "serofedsoc":

's' -> 'c'

'e' -> 'o'

'r' -> 'd'

'o' -> 'e'

'f' -> 'f'

'e' -> 'o'

'd' -> 'r'

's' -> 'c'

'o' -> 'e'

'c' -> 's'

Which gives "codeforces" — correct.

Another test case:

Encoded 'b': "fft"

Unique characters: 'f', 't' sorted to "ft"

Mapping:

'f' <-> 't'

't' <-> 'f'

Decoding "fft":

'f' -> 't'

'f' -> 't'

't' -> 'f'

Which gives "ttf" — but according to the sample output, it should be "fft" decoded to "algorithm". Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the sample input, for 'b' = "ttlrhgmaoi", the output is "algorithm". Wait, I need to check the sample input and output again.

Wait, the sample input is:

5

10

serofedsoc

3

ttf

9

tlrhgmaoi

1

w

15

hnndledmnhlttin

And the corresponding outputs are:

codeforces

fft

algorithm

w

meetinthemiddle

Wait, in the first test case, 'b' = "serofedsoc" decodes to "codeforces", which matches.

In the second test case, 'b' = "ttf" decodes to "fft".

Wait, but according to the sample output, it should be "fft" for 'b' = "ttf".

Wait, no, the sample output shows "fft" for 'b' = "ttf", but according to the decoding process, "ttf" should decode to "fft". Wait, no, let's see.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input and output. Let's look again.

Sample Input:

5

10

serofedsoc

3

ttf

9

tlrhgmaoi

1

w

15

hnndledmnhlttin

Sample Output:

codeforces

fft

algorithm

w

meetinthemiddle

Wait, for 'b' = "ttf", the output is "fft". So, let's see.

Unique characters in "ttf": 'f', 't' sorted to "ft"

Mapping:

'f' <-> 't'

't' <-> 'f'

Decoding "ttf":

't' -> 'f'

't' -> 'f'

'f' -> 't'

Which gives "fft" — matches the sample output.

Another test case:

'b' = "tlrhgmaoi"

Unique characters: 'a', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'm', 'o', 'r', 't' sorted to "aghilmort"

Mapping:

'a' <-> 't'

'g' <-> 'r'

'h' <-> 'o'

'i' <-> 'm'

'l' <-> 'i'

'm' <-> 'l'

'o' <-> 'h'

'r' <-> 'g'

't' <-> 'a'

Decoding "tlrhgmaoi":

't' -> 'a'

'l' -> 'i'

'r' -> 'g'

'h' -> 'o'

'g' -> 'r'

'm' -> 'l'

'a' -> 't'

'o' -> 'h'

'i' -> 'm'

Which gives "algorithm" — matches the sample output.

Another test case:

'b' = "w"

Unique characters: 'w' sorted to "w"

Mapping:

'w' <-> 'w'

Decoding "w" -> "w" — matches the sample output.

Last test case:

'b' = "hnndledmnhlttin"

Unique characters: 'd', 'e', 'h', 'l', 'm', 'n', 't' sorted to "dehlmnt"

Mapping:

'd' <-> 't'

'e' <-> 'n'

'h' <-> 'm'

'l' <-> 'l'

'm' <-> 'h'

'n' <-> 'e'

't' <-> 'd'

Decoding "hnndledmnhlttin":

'h' -> 'm'

'n' -> 'e'

'n' -> 'e'

'd' -> 't'

'l' -> 'l'

'e' -> 'n'

'd' -> 't'

'e' -> 'n'

'm' -> 'h'

'n' -> 'e'

'h' -> 'm'

'l' -> 'l'

't' -> 'd'

't' -> 'd'

'i' -> ?

Wait, 'i' is not in 'r', but in the sample input, 'b' is "hnndledmnhlttin", which should only contain characters from 'r', which are 'd', 'e', 'h', 'l', 'm', 'n', 't'. But 'i' is present, which is not in 'r'. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the sample input, 'b' is "hnndledmnhlttin", but according to the problem, 'b' consists only of lowercase Latin letters, and it's guaranteed that the encoding is correct.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my mapping or understanding.

Wait, let's check the sample output for this 'b': "meetinthemiddle"

Unique characters in "meetinthemiddle": 'd', 'e', 'h', 'i', 'm', 'n', 't' sorted to "dehimnt"

Mapping:

'd' <-> 't'

'e' <-> 'n'

'h' <-> 'm'

'i' <-> 'i'

'm' <-> 'h'

'n' <-> 'e'

't' <-> 'd'

Decoding "hnndledmnhlttin":

'h' -> 'm'

'n' -> 'e'

'n' -> 'e'

'd' -> 't'

'l' -> not in mapping?

Wait, "meetinthemiddle" contains 'm', 'e', 't', 'i', 'n', 'h', 'd', 'l' sorted to "dehimnlt"

Wait, seems consistent.

But in 'b' = "hnndledmnhlttin", all characters are in 'r' = "dehimnt"

So, decoding:

'h' -> 'm'

'n' -> 'e'

'n' -> 'e'

'd' -> 't'

'l' -> 'l'

'e' -> 'n'

'd' -> 't'

'e' -> 'n'

'm' -> 'h'

'n' -> 'e'

'h' -> 'm'

'l' -> 'l'

't' -> 'd'

't' -> 'd'

'i' -> 'i'

'n' -> 'e'

Which gives "meetinthemiddle" — matches the sample output.

Therefore, the approach seems correct.

Now, looking back at the program, it seems to implement this approach accurately.

Potential edge cases to consider:

1. **Single character:**

- 'b' = "a"

- 'r' = "a"

- Mapping: 'a' <-> 'a'

- Decoded: "a"

- Which is correct.

2. **All characters same:**

- 'b' = "aaa"

- 'r' = "a"

- Mapping: 'a' <-> 'a'

- Decoded: "aaa"

- Which should be correct.

3. **Two unique characters:**

- 'b' = "abba"

- 'r' = "ab"

- Mapping: 'a' <-> 'b', 'b' <-> 'a'

- Decoded: "babb"

- Which should be correct.

4. **Empty string:**

- Not applicable, as per constraints, n >=1

5. **Maximum input size:**

- n = 2e5, t = 1e4, but sum of n over all test cases <= 2e5.

- The program should handle this efficiently.

Potential issues:

- Time constraints: Since t can be up to 1e4 and n up to 2e5, but sum of n over all test cases is <= 2e5, the program should be efficient enough.

- Space constraints: Storing all results in a list and joining at the end should be fine.

- Correctly handling the mapping, especially when there are an odd number of characters in 'r'.

- Ensuring that all characters in 'b' are present in 'r' and correctly mapped.

Given that, the program seems correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to decode a given string that was encoded using a specific method involving a sorted unique character string `r`. The approach involves reconstructing `r` from the encoded string and then mapping each character in the encoded string back to its original character based on the symmetric positions in `r`.

### Approach

1. **Reconstruct the auxiliary string `r`**:
   - Extract all unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - Sort these unique characters to form `r`.

2. **Create a mapping for decoding**:
   - For each character in `r`, determine its symmetric counterpart in `r`. For example, the first character in `r` maps to the last character in `r`, the second to the second last, and so on.

3. **Decode the encoded string `b`**:
   - Replace each character in `b` with its corresponding original character from `r` using the mapping created in the previous step.

4. **Output the decoded string**:
   - Collect the results for all test cases and print them.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read all input data at once and split it into a list for easy access.
   - Extract the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, read the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - Use the `func_1` function to decode `b` and store the result.

3. **Decoding Function `func_1`**:
   - Construct `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string.
   - Create a mapping where each character in `r` is paired with its symmetric character in `r`.
   - Decode the encoded string by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the mapping.

4. **Output**:
   - Print all decoded strings for the test cases, each on a new line.

This approach ensures that the encoded string is correctly decoded by reversing the encoding process step by step.
