Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers doesn't have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bits should be different.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. If two numbers are in the same group, their binary representations should differ in all bit positions from 1 to 31. That sounds strict. Essentially, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x XOR y should have all bits set to 1 from position 1 to 31. Wait, no. Actually, if x and y differ in all bit positions, then x XOR y should be all 1s in those positions.

Wait, let's think about XOR:

- If two bits are the same, XOR is 0.

- If two bits are different, XOR is 1.

So, if x and y differ in all bit positions from 1 to 31, then x XOR y should have all bits from 1 to 31 set to 1.

In other words, x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1, which is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1.

Wait, but the problem says "any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit". So, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit from 1 to 31, their bits are different.

So, in terms of XOR, x XOR y should have those bits set to 1.

But, actually, the condition is stronger. It's not just that x XOR y has all bits from 1 to 31 set to 1, but that for any two numbers in the group, their bits are different in all positions from 1 to 31.

Wait, but that's exactly what x XOR y having all bits from 1 to 31 set to 1 means.

So, in other words, for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

Hmm, but that seems impossible because (1 << 31) - 1 is a specific value, and for any two numbers, their XOR being equal to this specific value is unlikely unless the numbers are specifically chosen.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me read the problem again.

"any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit"

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values are different.

Wait, that means, for any two numbers in the same group, in each bit position from 1 to 31, their bits are not equal.

In other words, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x and y differ in every bit position from 1 to 31.

That's a very strong condition.

In terms of XOR, x XOR y should have those bits set to 1.

So, x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

But, wait, that's only true for a specific pair x and y.

But the condition must hold for any pair in the group.

So, in other words, in any group, all pairs of numbers must have XOR equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

Wait, but that's impossible because if you have three numbers a, b, c in the same group, then:

a XOR b = (1 << 31) - 1

a XOR c = (1 << 31) - 1

b XOR c = (1 << 31) - 1

But, from a XOR b = (1 << 31) - 1 and a XOR c = (1 << 31) - 1, then b XOR c = 0, which contradicts b XOR c = (1 << 31) - 1.

So, groups can have at most two elements.

Wait, but the problem allows for groups with any number of elements, but with that condition.

But from the above, it seems that groups can have at most two elements, and only if those two elements differ in all 31 bits.

But, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the condition is that for any two numbers in the group, there is no bit position from 1 to 31 where both have the same value.

Wait, but that's still very restrictive.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit"

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values are different.

Wait, that sounds like for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR in bits 1 to 31 is all 1's.

But as I thought earlier, that's only possible for pairs, and not for larger groups.

Unless all elements in the group are such that any two of them have XOR equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

But that's only possible if the group has at most one element, because if you have two elements, their XOR would have to be (1 << 31) - 1, but then adding a third would require it to have XOR equal to (1 << 31) - 1 with both of the first two, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the condition is that for any two numbers in the group, there is no bit position where both have the same bit value.

In other words, for any two numbers, their bitwise AND in bits 1 to 31 is zero.

Is that what it's saying?

Wait, let's look back at the problem statement.

"any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit"

So, for any two numbers in the group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values are different.

Wait, that means, for any two numbers, in every bit position from 1 to 31, their bits are different.

That is, for any two numbers, their XOR in bits 1 to 31 is all 1's.

But as I thought earlier, that's only possible for pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that no two numbers in the group share a 1 in the same bit position.

That would mean that for any two numbers, their bitwise AND in bits 1 to 31 is zero.

That seems more plausible.

Wait, let's see.

If that's the case, then the problem is to partition the numbers into groups where, within each group, no two numbers share a 1 in any bit position from 1 to 31.

That makes more sense.

In other words, in each group, the numbers are pairwise disjoint in terms of their bit sets from 1 to 31.

If that's the case, then this is similar to placing numbers into groups where no two numbers in the same group have a common set bit in positions 1 to 31.

This is akin to a graph coloring problem, where each number is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if they share a common set bit in positions 1 to 31. The goal is to find the chromatic number of this graph, which is the minimum number of colors (groups) needed so that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.

However, computing the chromatic number is NP-hard, so there must be a smarter way to approach this problem given the constraints.

Let me think differently.

If two numbers share a common set bit in positions 1 to 31, they cannot be in the same group. Therefore, the groups must be such that no two numbers in the same group share any set bit in positions 1 to 31.

This is similar to packing sets where no two sets in the same pack overlap in positions 1 to 31.

To minimize the number of groups, we need to maximize the number of numbers in each group, meaning we want to pack as many numbers as possible into a group as long as they don't share any common set bits in positions 1 to 31.

This sounds like a classic problem of finding the minimum number of groups such that no two items in the same group conflict, where conflict is defined as sharing a common set bit in positions 1 to 31.

In terms of graph theory, this is equivalent to finding the minimum number of colors needed to color a graph where nodes are numbers and edges connect numbers that share a common set bit in positions 1 to 31.

But as I said earlier, computing the chromatic number is NP-hard, so there must be a smarter way to approach this problem given the constraints.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to model this using bit manipulation or some other optimization.

Let me consider the properties of the numbers and their bit representations.

Each number can be represented by its set bits in positions 1 to 31.

If two numbers share a set bit in any of these positions, they cannot be in the same group.

So, to maximize the number of numbers in a group, we need to ensure that no two numbers in the group have overlapping set bits in positions 1 to 31.

This is similar to assigning numbers to groups based on their bit masks, ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have overlapping set bits.

One way to approach this is to use a greedy algorithm where we iterate through the numbers and assign each number to the first group that doesn't conflict with it, i.e., the group where none of the existing numbers in the group share any set bits in positions 1 to 31 with the current number.

However, this approach could be inefficient for large n, as it would require checking each number against all groups and their numbers.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5, we need a more efficient approach.

Perhaps there's a way to model this problem using independent sets or some other graph theory concept, but again, directly applying those concepts might not be feasible due to time constraints.

Let me think about the properties of the bit masks.

Each number has a bit mask of 31 bits.

We need to group numbers such that no two in the same group have overlapping set bits.

This sounds similar to partitioning sets where the sets are mutually exclusive in terms of their bit representations.

In such a case, the minimum number of groups required would be equal to the maximum number of numbers that have overlapping set bits, i.e., the maximum number of numbers that cannot be placed in the same group because they share at least one set bit.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Actually, in scheduling problems, the minimum number of groups (or time slots) needed is equal to the size of the largest set of mutually conflicting items.

In this case, it would be the size of the largest set of numbers where each pair shares at least one set bit.

But finding that directly seems difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the bit masks and find a way to merge compatible numbers.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion or something similar.

Another idea: since the conflict is based on shared set bits, perhaps we can represent each number by its bit mask and find a way to group them such that no two masks in the same group have a non-empty intersection.

This is similar to partitioning a set of sets where no two sets in the same group intersect.

In such a case, the minimum number of groups is equal to the size of the largest subset of pairwise intersecting sets.

But again, this seems complex to compute directly.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider the problem differently.

Suppose I represent each number by its bit mask.

I need to group these masks such that in each group, no two masks have a common set bit.

This is equivalent to having the bitwise AND of any two masks in the group being zero.

To minimize the number of groups, I need to maximize the number of masks in each group under this condition.

This sounds similar to the problem of finding the maximum matching in a graph, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node is a mask, and edges connect masks that have a non-zero bitwise AND.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the chromatic number of this graph.

But again, computing the chromatic number is NP-hard.

Given the constraints, I need a more efficient approach.

Perhaps I can look at the problem from the perspective of bit patterns.

Each number can be seen as a subset of the 31 bits, and I need to group these subsets such that no two subsets in the same group have a non-empty intersection.

This is similar to partitioning the subsets into disjoint sets where no two subsets in the same set share any elements.

In set theory, this is akin to partitioning the power set of 31 elements into subsets where no two subsets in the same partition share any elements.

The minimum number of such partitions is equal to the size of the largest subset in terms of the number of elements it covers.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the concept of packing sets.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think about small examples to get some intuition.

Take n=2, a=[1, 2].

Binary representations:

1: 001

2: 010

They don't share any set bits, so they can be in the same group.

So, minimum number of groups is 1.

Another example: n=3, a=[1, 2, 3].

Binary representations:

1: 001

2: 010

3: 011

Here, 1 and 2 can be in the same group, but 3 shares bits with both 1 and 2, so it needs its own group.

Thus, minimum number of groups is 2.

Another example: n=4, a=[1, 1, 2, 3].

Binary representations:

1: 001

1: 001

2: 010

3: 011

Here, the two 1's cannot be in the same group as each other because they share all set bits.

So, they need separate groups.

2 and 3 can be in the same group as long as they don't share a group with 1.

But since 3 shares bits with both 1's, it needs its own group.

2 can be in a group with neither 1 nor 3, so it can have its own group.

So, minimum number of groups is 3.

Wait, but maybe 2 and 3 can be in the same group since they don't share all bits.

Wait, 2: 010, 3: 011.

They share the second bit.

So, they cannot be in the same group.

Thus, each number needs its own group.

So, minimum number of groups is 4.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=3, a=[1,2,3], 2 and 3 cannot be in the same group because they share the second bit.

So, in that case, minimum number of groups is 3.

Wait, but in the first test case of the sample input, n=4, a=[1,4,3,4], and the output is 4.

According to the explanation, "In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need to place each number in its own group."

Wait, but 1,4,3,4 in binary are:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

So, 1 and 4 differ in all bits (001 vs 100), 1 and 3 share the least significant bit, 4 and 3 share no bits.

Wait, but according to the problem, in the first test case, they have to be placed in separate groups.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, 1 and 4 can be in the same group because they differ in all bits, and 3 and 4 can be in separate groups.

But according to the sample input, all four need separate groups.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Looking back, the problem says: "any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit."

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values are different.

In other words, for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise AND in bits 1 to 31 is zero.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, a=[1,4,3,4].

Binary representations:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

So, 1 and 4: 001 & 100 = 000 → fine

1 and 3: 001 & 011 = 001 → not fine

4 and 3: 100 & 011 = 000 → fine

4 and 4: 100 & 100 = 100 → not fine

So, to satisfy the condition, each number needs its own group because there are numbers that share bits with others.

Wait, but according to the sample input, the output is 4, meaning each number is in its own group.

But according to my earlier reasoning, 1 and 4 can be in the same group because they don't share any bits, and similarly, the two 4's cannot be in the same group because they share all bits.

But in the sample input, it's 4 groups, so perhaps the problem requires that no two numbers in the same group share any set bits.

So, in that case, 1 and 4 can be in the same group because they don't share any set bits, but since there are two 4's, they cannot be in the same group because they share all set bits.

Similarly, 3 shares bits with 1, so it needs its own group.

So, groups could be:

Group 1: 1,4 (first occurrence)

Group 2: 3

Group 3: 4 (second occurrence)

But the sample output is 4, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in group 1, 1 and 4 are fine, but 4 (second occurrence) cannot be in group 1 because it shares bits with the first 4.

So, it needs its own group.

Hence, 4 groups.

So, perhaps the condition is that no two numbers in the same group share any set bits, and also, no two identical numbers can be in the same group.

Wait, but the problem says "any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit."

So, if two numbers have any bit position from 1 to 31 with the same value, they cannot be in the same group.

In the case of two identical numbers, they have all bits the same, so they cannot be in the same group.

In the case of 1 and 3, they have the least significant bit both set to 1, so they cannot be in the same group.

In the case of 1 and 4, they have no bits in common, so they can be in the same group.

Hence, in the first test case, the minimal number of groups is 4.

In the second test case, n=2, a=[0,2147483647].

Binary representations:

0: 000...000

2147483647: 111...111

They don't share any set bits (since 0 has all 0s), so they can be in the same group.

Hence, output is 1.

In the third test case, n=5, a=[476319172,261956880,2136179468,1671164475,1885526767].

I need to check their binary representations to see which can be grouped together.

But that seems time-consuming without actual bit analysis.

According to the sample output, it's 3 groups.

So, perhaps in this case, the numbers can be partitioned into 3 groups where no two numbers in the same group share any set bits.

Moving on, in the fourth test case, n=3, a=[1335890506,811593141,1128223362].

Sample output is 2.

So, perhaps two groups are sufficient for these three numbers.

Fifth test case, n=4, a=[688873446,627404104,1520079543,1458610201], output is 2.

Sixth test case, n=4, a=[61545621,2085938026,1269342732,1430258575], output is 3.

Seventh test case, n=4, a=[0,0,2147483647,2147483647], output is 2.

Eighth test case, n=3, a=[0,0,2147483647], output is 2.

Ninth test case, n=8, a=[1858058912,289424735,1858058912,2024818580,1858058912,289424735,122665067,289424735], output is 4.

From these examples, it seems that the minimal number of groups required varies based on how the numbers' bit sets overlap.

Now, back to the problem of finding an efficient way to compute this.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5, we need an O(n*t) or O(n*log n) solution.

I need to find a way to group the numbers efficiently based on their bit sets.

One idea is to use a greedy approach where I iterate through the numbers and assign each number to a group where it doesn't conflict with any number already in that group.

To implement this efficiently, I can maintain a list of existing groups and, for each number, check which groups it can be added to (i.e., it doesn't share any set bits with any number already in the group).

However, checking for each number against all existing groups would be too slow for large n.

I need a smarter way to assign numbers to groups.

Perhaps I can think in terms of conflict graphs, where nodes are numbers and edges connect numbers that share at least one set bit.

Then, the minimal number of groups is equal to the chromatic number of this graph.

But, again, computing the chromatic number is NP-hard.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to represent the conflicts using bit manipulation.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can help here.

Another idea: since the conflict is based on shared set bits, maybe I can represent each number by its bit mask and find a way to merge masks that don't conflict.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the properties of the bit masks.

Each number's mask is a subset of the 31 bits.

I need to group these subsets such that no two subsets in the same group overlap (i.e., have a non-empty intersection).

In set terms, this is equivalent to partitioning the subsets into disjoint sets where no two subsets in the same set share any elements.

In such a case, the minimal number of groups required is equal to the size of the largest subset in terms of the number of elements it covers, because each group can hold subsets that don't overlap.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's equal to the maximum number of subsets that all overlap with each other.

But that seems difficult to compute.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the bit masks and try to find a way to combine them based on their OR operations.

If I take the OR of all masks in a group, then no two masks should have overlapping set bits, meaning that the OR of the group is just the sum of the individual masks.

Wait, that might not help directly.

Another angle: since the conflict is based on shared set bits, perhaps I can sort the numbers based on the number of set bits and use a greedy approach to assign them to groups.

But I'm not sure if that would yield the minimal number of groups.

Wait, perhaps if I sort the numbers in decreasing order of the number of set bits, and then assign each number to the first group that doesn't conflict with it, that might minimize the number of groups.

But even that seems inefficient for large n.

Given time constraints, I need a better approach.

Let me consider the problem from a different perspective.

Suppose I represent each number by its bit mask, and I need to ensure that no two masks in the same group have a bitwise AND that is non-zero.

To minimize the number of groups, I need to maximize the number of masks in each group under this condition.

This sounds similar to packing the masks into groups where each group is a set of masks that are pairwise disjoint in terms of their set bits.

In such a scenario, the minimal number of groups required is equal to the maximum number of masks that cannot be placed in the same group because they all pairwise conflict with each other.

In other words, it's equal to the size of the largest set of masks where each pair shares at least one set bit.

But finding that directly seems difficult.

Perhaps there's a better way to model this problem.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the complement of the masks.

If I take the complement of each mask (flipping all its bits), then the condition becomes that in any group, any two complement masks have a bitwise AND of all 1's, meaning they are all identical.

Wait, that seems not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the masks and their conflicts in terms of their bit patterns.

I need to find a way to group the masks such that within each group, no two masks share any set bits.

This is similar to assigning registers in a processor, where each mask represents the bits (registers) used by a variable, and we need to assign variables to registers such that no two variables in the same register set conflict.

In compiler design, this is known as graph coloring for register allocation.

But again, implementing a graph coloring algorithm here would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that each bit position is independent.

If two masks share a set bit in position i, they cannot be in the same group.

So, for each bit position, the masks that have that bit set must be in different groups.

Hence, the number of groups needed is determined by the maximum number of masks that share a set bit in any single bit position.

In other words, for each bit position from 1 to 31, count the number of masks that have that bit set, and then take the maximum of these counts.

This would give the minimal number of groups required.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me see.

Suppose I have bit position i, and k masks have that bit set.

Then, these k masks must be in different groups because any two of them cannot be in the same group due to sharing bit i.

Hence, at least k groups are needed for these masks.

Similarly, for each bit position, I have a certain number of masks that have that bit set, and I need to ensure that all masks with the same set bit are in different groups.

Therefore, the minimal number of groups required is equal to the maximum number of masks that share a set bit in any single bit position.

In other words, it's the maximum, over all bit positions from 1 to 31, of the number of masks that have that bit set.

This seems correct.

Let me verify with the sample input.

First test case: n=4, a=[1,4,3,4].

Binary representations:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

Looking at each bit position:

Bit 1: set in 1,3 → 2 masks

Bit 2: set in 3 → 1 mask

Bit 3: set in 4,4 → 2 masks

Hence, the maximum is 2, but the sample output is 4.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps my reasoning is incomplete.

Wait, in the first test case, why is the output 4?

Because each number needs its own group due to conflicts.

But according to my earlier reasoning, based on the maximum number of masks sharing a set bit, it should be 2.

But clearly, that's not sufficient, as per the sample input.

So, perhaps my approach is missing something.

Let me think again.

Maybe I need to consider that a mask can have multiple set bits, and hence can be involved in conflicts across multiple bit positions.

So, simply taking the maximum number of masks that share a set bit in any single bit position might not account for the overlaps in conflicts across multiple bit positions.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider the overall conflict graph, where conflicts are accumulated across all bit positions.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through all masks and keep track of the groups assigned to each mask based on conflict.

I can use a dictionary to map masks to their group indices.

But again, this seems too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to model this using bit manipulation and some kind of union-find structure.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since the conflict is based on shared set bits, perhaps I can represent the masks as vectors in a 31-dimensional space over GF(2), and find the rank of the matrix formed by these vectors.

But that seems overkill and not directly applicable.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I represent each mask as a unique identifier and group them based on their conflicts.

But again, without a clear algorithm, this is too vague.

Let me look back at the provided code to see if that gives any insight.

The code defines a function func_1(n, a):

- It initializes a counter dictionary.

- For each number in a:

- If the number is not in the counter, it adds the complement of the number to the counter and increments the result.

- If the number is in the counter, it decrements the counter for that number, and if the count reaches zero, it deletes it.

Finally, it returns the result.

Wait, this seems off.

First, it's using (1 << 31) - 1 to get a mask with the first 31 bits set to 1.

Then, for each number, if it's not in the counter, it adds the complement of the number to the counter and increments the result.

If it's already in the counter, it decrements the counter for that number.

This seems like some kind of pairing or matching based on complements.

But I don't see how this directly relates to the problem of grouping masks based on their conflicts.

Perhaps the idea is that for each mask, its complement (in terms of the first 31 bits) can be in the same group.

But according to the problem, the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise AND in bits 1 to 31 is zero.

So, if two masks have a bitwise AND of zero, they can be in the same group.

Hence, perhaps the function is trying to group masks that are complements of each other.

Wait, but the complement would be mask ^ ((1 << 31) - 1).

So, if two masks are complements, their bitwise AND would be zero, since one has 0 where the other has 1, and vice versa.

Hence, they can be in the same group.

So, perhaps the function is trying to pair masks that are complements of each other into the same group, and unpaired masks get their own group.

In that case, the number of groups would be equal to the number of such pairs plus the number of unpaired masks.

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Looking back at the sample input and output, in the first test case, n=4, a=[1,4,3,4].

Complements:

1: 111...110

4: 111...101

3: 111...100

4: 111...101

So, the complements are:

1: complement A

4: complement B

3: complement C

4: complement B

Now, according to the function, for each number not in the counter, it adds its complement to the counter and increments the result.

If the number is already in the counter, it decrements the counter for that number.

So, let's simulate this:

Initialize counter = {}

Process 1:

1 not in counter, so add complement of 1 (which is (1<<31)-1 ^ 1) to counter, set to 1, and increment result to 1.

counter = {complement_A:1}

result=1

Process 4:

4 not in counter, so add complement of 4 to counter, set to 1, and increment result to 2.

counter = {complement_A:1, complement_B:1}

result=2

Process 3:

3 not in counter, so add complement of 3 to counter, set to 1, and increment result to 3.

counter = {complement_A:1, complement_B:1, complement_C:1}

result=3

Process 4:

4 is in counter (complement_B is already in counter), so decrement counter[4] by 1, which becomes 0, then delete it.

counter = {complement_A:1, complement_C:1}

result=3

But the function seems to return result=3, but the sample output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the implementation.

Looking back at the code:

def func_1(n, a):

res = 0

count = {}

for num in a:

if num not in count:

count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1

res += 1

else:

count[num] -= 1

if count[num] == 0:

del count[num]

return res

So, in the first test case, n=4, a=[1,4,3,4]

Initialize count={}

Process 1:

1 not in count, so count[(1<<31)-1 ^ 1] = count.get((1<<31)-1 ^ 1, 0) +1

Assuming (1<<31)-1 ^ 1 is complement_A

count = {complement_A:1}

res=1

Process 4:

4 not in count, so count[(1<<31)-1 ^ 4] = count.get((1<<31)-1 ^ 4, 0) +1

Assuming (1<<31)-1 ^ 4 is complement_B

count = {complement_A:1, complement_B:1}

res=2

Process 3:

3 not in count, so count[(1<<31)-1 ^ 3] = count.get((1<<31)-1 ^ 3, 0) +1

Assuming (1<<31)-1 ^ 3 is complement_C

count = {complement_A:1, complement_B:1, complement_C:1}

res=3

Process 4:

4 is in count, so count[4] -=1 → count[4] = 0, then del count[4]

count = {complement_A:1, complement_C:1}

res=3

But the sample output is 4, not 3.

So, perhaps the function is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back:

for num in a:

if num not in count:

count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) +1

res +=1

else:

count[num] -=1

if count[num] ==0:

del count[num]

In the last step, when processing the second 4, it finds that 4 is in count (since count has complement_B, which is the complement of 4), but actually, num=4 is in count because we previously added complement_B to count when we saw the first 4.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion between num and its complement.

Wait, perhaps the function is trying to pair each mask with its complement.

So, for each mask, if its complement is not in the count, add the complement to the count and increment the result.

If the complement is in the count, decrement the count for the complement.

But in this case, for the first 4, it adds complement_B to count, then for the second 4, it sees that complement_B is in count, so it decrements count[complement_B], and since it reaches zero, deletes it.

Hence, in this case, res=3, but the sample output is 4.

So, the function seems to be incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
