Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, using this process.

First, I need to understand the cutting part. He can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically, parallel to one of the sides. So, if he has a rectangle of size a by b, he can cut it into two rectangles of size a by something, or something by b.

Let's think about the possible ways he can cut the rectangle. If he cuts parallel to the side of length a, he's essentially dividing the side of length b into two parts, say b1 and b2, such that b1 + b2 = b. Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the side of length b, he's dividing the side of length a into two parts, a1 and a2, with a1 + a2 = a.

After cutting, he has two smaller rectangles, and he can rotate and move them around to try to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle can be of different dimensions, but if it's just a rotation of the original, it doesn't count as a different rectangle.

The problem gives some examples to illustrate this. For instance, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and then these can be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6. On the other hand, a 2x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original.

So, my task is to determine, for given a and b, whether Bob can form a new rectangle that is not the same as the original one under rotation.

I need to think about the conditions under which this is possible.

First, let's consider the area of the rectangle. The area is a*b, and any new rectangle formed from the two pieces must have the same area. So, any possible new rectangle must have dimensions c and d such that c*d = a*b.

Moreover, the new rectangle should not be the same as the original one up to rotation. That means that the pair (c, d) should not be equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

So, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a pair (c, d) such that c*d = a*b, and (c, d) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a), and c and d are integers.

But there's more to it because Bob has specific constraints on how he can form the new rectangle from the two pieces he gets after cutting the original rectangle.

He cuts the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then tries to arrange them to form a new rectangle. So, the two pieces must be rearranged to form the new rectangle.

Let's think about how the two pieces can be arranged to form a new rectangle.

Suppose Bob cuts the original rectangle into two pieces by making a cut parallel to one side.

Case 1: He cuts parallel to side a, dividing side b into b1 and b2, so he gets two rectangles of size a by b1 and a by b2.

Now, he can arrange these two rectangles side by side either horizontally or vertically to form a new rectangle.

If he arranges them horizontally, he would have a rectangle of size a by (b1 + b2), which is the same as the original a by b.

If he arranges them vertically, he would have a rectangle of size (a + a) by max(b1, b2), but that doesn't necessarily give a new rectangle unless b1 and b2 are chosen appropriately.

Wait, actually, if he arranges them vertically, stacking one on top of the other, the height would be (b1 + b2), which is b, and the width would be a, so again, it's the same as the original.

Alternatively, maybe he can arrange them in some other way to get a different rectangle.

Wait, the problem mentions that he can rotate the rectangles. So, perhaps by rotating one or both of the pieces, he can form a different rectangle.

Let's consider an example given: a 2x6 rectangle.

He cuts it into two 2x3 rectangles.

Then, he can rotate one of them by 90 degrees, turning it into a 3x2 rectangle.

Now, he has one 2x3 and one 3x2 rectangle.

If he arranges them side by side horizontally, he can get a rectangle of size (2 + 3) by 3, which is 5x3.

Wait, but in the problem description, it says he can form a 4x3 rectangle.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, if he has two 2x3 rectangles, and he rotates one to become 3x2, then arranges them side by side horizontally, one being 2x3 and the other 3x2, how does that work?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps he arranges them by placing them adjacent to each other in a way that their sides match up to form a new rectangle.

Let me try to visualize this.

Suppose he has two 2x3 rectangles.

Option 1: Place them side by side horizontally: total width 2 + 2 = 4, height 3. So, a 4x3 rectangle.

Option 2: Place them side by side vertically: total width 3 + 3 = 6, height 2. Which is a 6x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x6, which is the original.

So, in this case, he can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 rectangle.

Another example: 3x2 rectangle.

He can cut it into two 3x1 rectangles.

Then, by rotating one of them, he can arrange them to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is the same as 6x1, which is considered the same as 1x6.

But the problem says in the note that from 3x2, he can cut into two 3x1 and form a 1x6, which is the same as 6x1, which is considered the same as the original 3x2.

Wait, but 3x2 and 6x1 are considered different rectangles, right? Because one is 3x2 and the other is 6x1.

Wait, no, in the note, it says:

"the 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and from these, the 1x6 rectangle can be formed, which is different from the original 3x2 rectangle."

Wait, but isn't 1x6 the same as 6x1, which is different from 3x2?

But according to the problem, they are considered different if they differ only by rotation.

Wait, but 1x6 and 6x1 are considered the same, and 3x2 and 2x3 are considered the same.

But 1x6 is different from 3x2, because one is 1x6 and the other is 3x2.

Wait, but in the note, it says that from 3x2, he can form a 1x6, which is different from the original 3x2.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

But according to the sample input and output, for 3x2, the output is "Yes", meaning he can form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the note, it says "the 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and from these, the 1x6 rectangle can be formed, which is different from the original 3x2 rectangle."

So, in this case, it's possible.

Wait, but according to the sample input and output, for 3x2, the output is "Yes".

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I thought that 3x2 and 1x6 are different, so it should be "Yes".

But according to the note, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me try to generalize this.

Given a rectangle a x b, Bob cuts it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.

Then, he can rotate and arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

He wants to know if he can form a new rectangle that is not the same as the original one up to rotation.

So, I need to find out if there exists a way to cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then arrange them to form a new rectangle with dimensions c x d, where (c, d) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

First, I need to consider the possible ways to cut the original rectangle.

Option 1: Cut parallel to side a, dividing side b into b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

This gives two rectangles: a x b1 and a x b2.

Option 2: Cut parallel to side b, dividing side a into a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = a.

This gives two rectangles: a1 x b and a2 x b.

Then, he can rotate these rectangles by 90 degrees if he wants.

So, for each piece, he can choose to rotate it or not.

Then, he needs to arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

The new rectangle must have area equal to the original area, a*b.

Now, the problem is to check if there exists a way to cut the rectangle and arrange the two pieces to form a new rectangle that is not the same as the original one up to rotation.

I need to find a general condition for a and b that allows this.

Let me consider some examples from the sample input.

Sample Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Sample Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

Let's analyze each case.

Case 1: 1x1

Cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, since both dimensions are 1.

So, no new rectangle can be formed.

Hence, "No".

Case 2: 2x1

Can be cut into two 1x1 rectangles.

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally gives a 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Arranging them vertically gives a 1x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x1 up to rotation.

So, no new rectangle can be formed.

Hence, "No".

Case 3: 2x6

As in the problem description, can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles.

Then, arranging them horizontally gives a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

Hence, "Yes".

Case 4: 3x2

As in the note, can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2.

Hence, "Yes".

Case 5: 2x2

Can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles.

Arranging them horizontally gives a 2x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Arranging them vertically gives a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

Hence, "Yes".

Case 6: 2x4

Can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles.

Arranging them horizontally gives a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x4 up to rotation.

Arranging them vertically gives a 2x4 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Alternatively, cutting parallel to the other side: cut into two 1x4 rectangles.

Arranging them horizontally gives a 2x4 rectangle, same as original.

Arranging them vertically gives a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

Hence, "Yes".

Case 7: 6x3

Can be cut into two 3x3 rectangles.

Arranging them horizontally gives a 6x3 rectangle, same as original.

Arranging them vertically gives a 3x6 rectangle, same as original up to rotation.

Alternatively, cutting parallel to the other side: cut into two 6x1 rectangles.

Arranging them horizontally gives a 6x2 rectangle, which is different from the original 6x3.

But according to the sample output, it's "No", which contradicts my reasoning.

Wait, but according to the sample output, for 6x3, it's "No".

But according to my reasoning, he can cut it into two 6x1 rectangles and arrange them horizontally to form a 6x2 rectangle, which is different from the original 6x3.

But according to the sample output, it's "No", meaning he cannot form a different rectangle.

This suggests that my reasoning might be flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the two pieces must be arranged to form a rectangle without overlapping, and their sides must align properly.

Alternatively, maybe there are constraints based on the dimensions.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

If a and b have a common divisor greater than 1, perhaps that affects whether a different rectangle can be formed.

Wait, maybe not directly.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

From the sample inputs:

- 1x1: No

- 2x1: No

- 2x6: Yes

- 3x2: Yes

- 2x2: Yes

- 2x4: Yes

- 6x3: No

Looking for a pattern, it seems that when both a and b are even, or when one is even and the other is odd in a certain way, the answer is "Yes", otherwise "No".

Wait, but in the sample input, 2x1 is even by odd, and it's "No", while 2x2 is even by even, and it's "Yes".

Similarly, 2x4 is even by even, "Yes", 6x3 is even by odd, "No".

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether a and b are both even, or if at least one of them is even.

But in the sample input, 2x1 is even by odd, and it's "No", while 2x2 is even by even, "Yes", 2x4 is even by even, "Yes", 6x3 is even by odd, "No".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" only if both a and b are even.

But in the sample input, 3x2 is odd by even, and it's "Yes", which contradicts that.

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" if at least one of them is even.

But then, 3x2 is odd by even, "Yes", 6x3 is even by odd, "No", which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if a*b is even.

But in 1x1, a*b is 1, which is odd, "No".

2x1, a*b=2, even, "No".

Wait, but according to the sample input, 2x1 is "No", even though a*b is even.

Similarly, 2x2, a*b=4, even, "Yes".

2x4, a*b=8, even, "Yes".

6x3, a*b=18, even, "No".

This doesn't seem consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a and b have a common factor other than 1.

But in 2x1, GCD is 1, "No".

2x2, GCD is 2, "Yes".

2x4, GCD is 2, "Yes".

6x3, GCD is 3, "No".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if GCD(a, b) is even, otherwise "No".

In 2x2, GCD=2, even, "Yes".

2x4, GCD=2, even, "Yes".

3x2, GCD=1, odd, "Yes"?

Wait, no, 3x2 is "Yes", but GCD is 1, which is odd.

Contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe it's "Yes" if a or b is even, except for certain cases.

But I need a general condition.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the aspect ratio of the original rectangle and the new rectangle.

The original rectangle has dimensions a and b.

The new rectangle has dimensions c and d, with c*d = a*b.

Moreover, (c, d) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

But I need to consider the cutting and rearrangement process.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the possible ways to tile two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

Given two rectangles, each of size p x q and r x s, they can be arranged side by side horizontally or vertically to form a new rectangle.

But in this problem, the two pieces are from cutting the original rectangle, so they are related in size.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the possible perimeters or something.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical condition based on a and b that determines whether a different rectangle can be formed.

Let me consider the total area, a*b.

If I can split this area into two parts, say m and n, such that m + n = a*b, and then arrange these two parts into rectangles that can be combined to form a new rectangle with dimensions c and d, where c*d = a*b and (c, d) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

But this seems too general.

I need to consider the constraints imposed by the cutting process.

Given that the cutting is parallel to one of the sides, the two pieces will have one dimension in common with the original rectangle.

For example, if cutting parallel to side a, the two pieces will both have dimension a.

Similarly, if cutting parallel to side b, the two pieces will both have dimension b.

Then, when rearranging them, if they are rotated, their dimensions can change.

So, if I cut parallel to side a, getting two pieces of a x b1 and a x b2, and then rotate one or both of them, their dimensions become a x b1, a x b2, or b1 x a, b2 x a.

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally or vertically to form a new rectangle.

Similarly, if cutting parallel to side b, getting two pieces of a1 x b and a2 x b, and rotating them to a1 x b, a2 x b, or b x a1, b x a2.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a pattern or find a mathematical condition that can be derived from a and b.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- 1x1: No

- 2x1: No

- 2x6: Yes

- 3x2: Yes

- 2x2: Yes

- 2x4: Yes

- 6x3: No

Looking for a pattern:

Looking at a and b:

- If both a and b are odd: 1x1 (No)

- If one is even and one is odd:

- 2x1 (No)

- 3x2 (Yes)

- 6x3 (No)

- If both are even:

- 2x2 (Yes)

- 2x4 (Yes)

- 2x6 (Yes)

It seems inconsistent at first glance.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether a or b is divisible by 2.

Wait, in 2x1, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd), output "No"

In 3x2, a=3 (odd), b=2 (even), output "Yes"

In 6x3, a=6 (even), b=3 (odd), output "No"

So, when a is even and b is odd, it's "No"

When a is odd and b is even, it's "Yes"

When both are even, it's "Yes"

When both are odd, it's "No"

That seems to be the pattern.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If at least one of a or b is even, output "Yes"

- Else, output "No"

But wait, in the sample input, 2x1 is even by odd, and it's "No"

Which contradicts this hypothesis.

Wait, but in the sample input, 2x1 is even by odd, and output is "No"

While 3x2 is odd by even, and output is "Yes"

This suggests that it's not symmetric in a and b.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if b is even, regardless of a.

But in 2x1, b=1 is odd, output "No"

In 3x2, b=2 is even, output "Yes"

In 2x2, b=2 is even, output "Yes"

In 2x4, b=4 is even, output "Yes"

In 6x3, b=3 is odd, output "No"

So, it seems that if b is even, output "Yes", else "No"

But in 2x1, b=1 is odd, output "No"

In 6x3, b=3 is odd, output "No"

In 3x2, b=2 is even, output "Yes"

In 2x2, b=2 is even, output "Yes"

In 2x4, b=4 is even, output "Yes"

In 2x6, b=6 is even, output "Yes"

So, it seems that if b is even, output "Yes", else "No"

But in the sample input, 2x1 has b=1, odd, output "No"

6x3 has b=3, odd, output "No"

3x2 has b=2, even, output "Yes"

2x2 has b=2, even, output "Yes"

2x4 has b=4, even, output "Yes"

2x6 has b=6, even, output "Yes"

1x1 has b=1, odd, output "No"

So, based on this, it seems that if b is even, output "Yes", else "No"

But wait, in the note, it says that from 3x2, which has b=2 even, output "Yes"

From 2x1, which has b=1 odd, output "No"

From 6x3, which has b=3 odd, output "No"

From 2x2, b=2 even, output "Yes"

From 2x4, b=4 even, output "Yes"

From 2x6, b=6 even, output "Yes"

From 1x1, b=1 odd, output "No"

So, it seems that the condition is solely based on whether b is even or odd.

If b is even, output "Yes", else "No"

But wait, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that a and b are interchangeable, since the rectangle can be rotated.

But in the sample input, for 3x2, which is the same as 2x3 up to rotation, the output is "Yes", while for 6x3, which is the same as 3x6, the output is "No"

Wait, perhaps it's based on whether the smaller dimension is even.

Wait, but in 3x2, the smaller dimension is 2, which is even, output "Yes"

In 2x1, the smaller dimension is 1, which is odd, output "No"

In 6x3, the smaller dimension is 3, which is odd, output "No"

In 2x2, the smaller dimension is 2, even, output "Yes"

In 2x4, smaller dimension is 2, even, output "Yes"

In 2x6, smaller dimension is 2, even, output "Yes"

In 1x1, smaller dimension is 1, odd, output "No"

So, perhaps the condition is: if the smaller dimension is even, output "Yes", else "No"

But in the sample input, this seems to hold.

But wait, what if a and b are both even, like 2x2, output "Yes"

Or both odd, like 1x1, output "No"

So, generalizing, if the smaller dimension is even, output "Yes", else "No"

But I need to confirm if this is always true.

Wait, but in the problem description, it's mentioned that for 2x1, it's "No", and for 2x6, it's "Yes"

According to my hypothesis, since the smaller dimension in 2x1 is 1 (odd), "No", and in 2x6, it's 2 (even), "Yes"

This matches.

Similarly, in 3x2, smaller dimension is 2 (even), "Yes"

In 6x3, smaller dimension is 3 (odd), "No"

So, this seems to hold.

Therefore, the condition is: if the smaller dimension is even, output "Yes", else "No"

But I need to verify if this is always correct.

Wait, but in the sample input, for 2x1, smaller dimension is 1, output "No"

For 2x2, smaller dimension is 2, output "Yes"

For 2x4, smaller dimension is 2, output "Yes"

For 2x6, smaller dimension is 2, output "Yes"

For 3x2, smaller dimension is 2, output "Yes"

For 6x3, smaller dimension is 3, output "No"

For 1x1, smaller dimension is 1, output "
