Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting array is one that can be divided into at least two parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR means. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is about subarrays. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. So, for a given range [l, r], I need to check if the subarray from index l to r can be split into at least two parts with equal XOR.

To approach this, I should think about the properties of XOR. One important property is that XOR is associative and commutative. That means the order in which we perform XOR operations doesn't matter.

I recall that prefix XOR can be useful in these kinds of problems. Prefix XOR is similar to prefix sum, where we compute the XOR from the start of the array up to each index. So, pf[i] would be the XOR of all elements from index 1 to i.

If I have pf[i], which is the XOR from 1 to i, then the XOR from l to r would be pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]. This is because XOR is its own inverse, so pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] gives me the XOR of elements from l to r.

Now, for the subarray from l to r to be interesting, I need to split it into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let's denote the XOR of the entire subarray from l to r as x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If x is zero, that means the subarray from l to r has an XOR of zero. In this case, I can split the subarray into any two parts, and since the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, the XOR of each part would also be zero. So, in this case, the answer is "YES."

But if x is not zero, things get trickier. I need to find at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let me think about how to find such parts.

Suppose I have the subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into k parts where k >= 2, and each part has the same XOR value.

Let's say the XOR of each part is y. Then, since the XOR of all parts together should give me the XOR of the entire subarray, which is x, I have:

y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times) = x

Now, if k is even, then y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = 0, because XORing y with itself an even number of times cancels out to zero.

If k is odd, then y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = y.

So, for the equation to hold, if k is even, x must be zero, and if k is odd, x must be y.

But in our case, x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], and y is the XOR of each part.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Another approach: for the subarray from l to r, I need to find indices l = p0 < p1 < p2 < ... < pk = r+1 such that the XOR from p0 to p1-1, p1 to p2-1, ..., pk-1 to pk-1 are all equal.

Letâ€™s denote this common XOR value as y.

So, y = pf[p1-1] XOR pf[p0-1] = pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p1-1] = ... = pf[pk-1] XOR pf[pk-1-1]

Wait, pf[p] is the XOR from 1 to p.

Actually, the XOR from p0 to p1-1 is pf[p1-1] XOR pf[p0-1].

Similarly, from p1 to p2-1 is pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p1-1], and so on.

All these should be equal to y.

So, we have pf[p1-1] XOR pf[p0-1] = pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p1-1] = ... = pf[pk-1] XOR pf[pk-1-1] = y

And also, the total XOR from p0 to pk-1 should be y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times), which should equal pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = x.

From earlier, if k is even, x = 0, and if k is odd, x = y.

So, for x != 0, we need k to be odd and y = x.

For x == 0, we can have any even k.

But in both cases, we need at least k >= 2.

So, for x == 0, we can always split into two parts with equal XOR (since XOR is zero for both).

For x != 0, we need to find at least two parts where each part has XOR = x.

Wait, but if x != 0 and k is odd, then x = y.

But how do I ensure that there are at least two parts with XOR = x?

Wait, maybe I need to look for indices where pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] = x, for i in [l, r].

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix l and r.

Compute x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If x == 0, then I can split into any even number of parts.

If x != 0, I need to find at least two parts where each part has XOR = x.

To find such splits, I need to find indices i where l <= i <= r such that pf[i-1] XOR pf[l-1] = x, and pf[r] XOR pf[i-1] = x.

Wait, that might not be the right way.

Let me consider that for the split to have each part with XOR = x, then the cumulative XOR up to the split points should be such that pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] = x for some i.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] = x for i in [l, r].

But I need to ensure that there is at least one such i where this holds, and also that r can be split accordingly.

Wait, maybe I need to check if there exists an index i in [l+1, r] such that pf[i-1] XOR pf[l-1] = x and pf[r] XOR pf[i-1] = x.

But this seems complicated.

Let me look for a better approach.

I recall that for the entire array, if the total XOR is zero, then it can be split into any even number of parts with equal XOR.

If the total XOR is not zero, then it can be split into an odd number of parts with equal XOR.

But in this problem, we need at least two parts.

So, for x == 0, it's always possible to split into two parts with equal XOR.

For x != 0, it's possible only if there exists at least one split point where the XOR up to that point equals x.

Wait, perhaps I need to find if there are at least two indices i in [l, r] such that pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] = x.

Because each such i would represent a split point where the first part has XOR x, and then the remaining subarray from i to r should also have XOR x.

But, to have at least two parts, I need at least one such split point in [l+1, r].

Wait, but I need to ensure that after splitting at i, the remaining part from i to r also has XOR x.

So, I need pf[i-1] XOR pf[l-1] = x and pf[r] XOR pf[i-1] = x.

Simplifying, pf[i-1] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and pf[r] = pf[i-1] XOR x = pf[l-1] XOR x XOR x = pf[l-1].

Wait, that would mean pf[r] = pf[l-1], which implies that x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[l-1] XOR pf[l-1] = 0.

So, only possible if x == 0.

This seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I need to consider multiple split points.

Let me try to think of a different strategy.

I know that for the entire array, if the total XOR is zero, it can be split into any even number of parts with equal XOR.

If the total XOR is not zero, it can be split into an odd number of parts with equal XOR.

But in this problem, I need to check for subarrays.

So, perhaps precompute the prefix XOR and then for each query [l, r], compute x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If x == 0, then it's always possible to split into any even number of parts.

If x != 0, then it's possible only if there exists at least one split point where the XOR up to that point equals x.

Wait, perhaps I need to store the positions where each prefix XOR value occurs and check for the required conditions.

Let me try to formalize this.

Precompute pf[i] = pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i from 1 to n.

Also, create a map that stores for each pf[i], the list of indices where this pf[i] occurs.

Then, for each query [l, r], compute x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If x == 0, then I need to check if there is at least one split point in [l+1, r] where pf[i-1] XOR pf[l-1] == x.

Since x == 0, pf[i-1] == pf[l-1].

So, I need to check if there is any i in [l+1, r] where pf[i-1] == pf[l-1].

Which means, check if there is any i in [l+1, r] where pf[i-1] == pf[l-1].

In other words, check if there is any j in [l, r-1] where pf[j] == pf[l-1].

So, look in the map for pf[l-1] and see if there is any index j in [l, r-1] where pf[j] == pf[l-1].

If such a j exists, then I can split at j, and the first part from l to j has XOR zero, and the second part from j+1 to r also has XOR zero.

Hence, "YES".

If x != 0, then I need to check if there exists at least one split point j in [l+1, r] where pf[j-1] XOR pf[l-1] == x and pf[r] XOR pf[j-1] == x.

Simplifying, pf[j-1] == pf[l-1] XOR x, and pf[r] == pf[j-1] XOR x.

But pf[j-1] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and pf[r] = (pf[l-1] XOR x) XOR x = pf[l-1].

So, this again leads to pf[r] == pf[l-1], which implies x == 0, which contradicts x != 0.

Hence, for x != 0, it's impossible to split into two parts with equal XOR.

Wait, but the sample input and output suggest that sometimes x != 0 and it's still possible.

Wait, in the first test case, for query 1 5, x = pf[5] XOR pf[0] = 0, so "YES".

Query 2 4, x = pf[4] XOR pf[1] = 3 XOR 1 = 2, which is not zero, but the output is "YES".

Wait, according to my previous logic, for x != 0, it's impossible, but the sample output says "YES".

So, my logic must be flawed.

Let me re-examine.

In the first test case, array is [1,1,2,3,0].

Query 2 4: subarray [1,2,3].

x = pf[4] XOR pf[1] = (1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3) XOR 1 = (1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3) XOR 1 = (0 XOR 2 XOR 3) XOR 1 = (2 XOR 3) XOR 1 = 1 XOR 1 = 0.

Wait, x should be zero for this query, but according to the note, it's possible to split [1,2],[3], and both have XOR 3.

Wait, 1 XOR 2 = 3, and 3 = 3, so y = 3.

So, x = y XOR y = 3 XOR 3 = 0.

Which matches.

But according to my earlier logic, if x == 0, it's possible to split into any even number of parts.

But in this case, it's split into two parts.

So, perhaps my earlier logic is correct, but I need to adjust it.

Wait, in this case, x = 0, and I can split into two parts with y = 3.

But 3 XOR 3 = 0, which matches x.

So, it's consistent.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it says that for query 2 4, x = 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, and it's possible to split into [1,2],[3], each with XOR 3.

Wait, but 3 XOR 3 = 0, which matches x.

So, it's consistent with my earlier logic.

Wait, perhaps I need to generalize this.

If x == 0, then it's possible to split into any even number of parts with equal XOR.

If x != 0, then it's possible to split into an odd number of parts, all with XOR y, where y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times) = x.

Given that k is odd, y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = y.

So, y = x, and k >= 1.

But in the problem, k > 1.

So, for x != 0, I need at least two parts with XOR = x.

Wait, but y XOR y = 0, which is not equal to x unless x = 0.

So, for x != 0, it's impossible to have k >= 2 with y XOR y ... XOR y = x.

Because for even k, it's 0, and for odd k, it's y.

So, only possible if y = x and k is odd.

But k >= 2, which is even, so x would need to be 0.

This seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that k >= 2, and for x != 0, it's impossible.

But the sample input suggests otherwise.

Wait, in the first test case, query 2 4: x = 0, and it's split into two parts, each with XOR = 3.

Wait, but 3 XOR 3 = 0, which matches x.

So, in this case, k = 2 (even), and x = 0.

This matches the earlier logic.

Wait, perhaps my confusion is arising from miscounting k.

Let's clarify:

- If x = 0, then it's possible to split into any even number of parts with equal XOR.

- If x != 0, then it's possible to split into an odd number of parts, each with XOR = x.

But in the problem, k > 1.

So, for x == 0, k >= 2, which is fine.

For x != 0, k must be odd and >= 3.

But in the sample, for query 2 4, x = 0, and it's split into k = 2 parts.

Which is allowed since k >= 2 and even.

Another query in the first test case is 1 3: subarray [1,1,2], x = pf[3] XOR pf[0] = 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 0 = 2.

Wait, pf[0] = 0, pf[1] = 1, pf[2] = 1 XOR 1 = 0, pf[3] = 0 XOR 2 = 2.

So, x = pf[3] XOR pf[0] = 2 XOR 0 = 2.

Which is not zero.

According to the sample output, it's "NO".

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, for x != 0, it's impossible to split into k >= 2 parts with equal XOR.

But the sample output says "NO", which matches.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that for query 2 4, x = 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, which is possible to split into k = 2 parts.

Wait, but in my calculation above, for query 1 3, x = 2, which is not zero, and the output is "NO".

So, perhaps the general rule is:

- If x == 0, then it's possible to split into any even number of parts with equal XOR.

- If x != 0, then it's possible to split into any odd number of parts with equal XOR = x.

But in the problem, k > 1.

So, for x == 0, k >= 2 even is allowed.

For x != 0, k >= 3 odd is allowed.

But in the sample, for x == 0, k = 2 is allowed, which is even.

For x != 0, k >= 3 odd is allowed, but k = 1 is not allowed since k > 1.

Hence, for x != 0, it's impossible to split into k >= 2 parts with equal XOR.

Because for k >= 2:

- If k is even, x must be 0.

- If k is odd, x must be y, where y is the XOR of each part.

But in this case, y = x, and k is odd >= 3.

But since k >= 2, and for x != 0, k must be odd >= 3, but in practice, it's impossible because the total XOR would be y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times) = y if k is odd, which should equal x.

So, y = x.

But to have k >= 3, it's possible only if there are at least two split points where the cumulative XOR up to that point is y.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for indices where pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] = y, for i in [l, r].

Then, between these indices, I can make splits.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Precompute prefix XOR.

- For each query [l, r], compute x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

- If x == 0, then it's possible to split into any even number of parts.

- If x != 0, then it's possible only if there exists at least one split point in [l+1, r] where pf[i-1] XOR pf[l-1] = x, and pf[r] XOR pf[i-1] = x.

Simplify the conditions:

pf[i-1] XOR pf[l-1] = x => pf[i-1] = x XOR pf[l-1]

pf[r] XOR pf[i-1] = x => pf[r] = x XOR pf[i-1] = x XOR (x XOR pf[l-1]) = pf[l-1]

So, pf[r] = pf[l-1], which implies x = 0.

Hence, for x != 0, it's impossible to have such a split.

But in the sample input, for query 2 4, x = 0, and it's possible to split into two parts.

For query 1 3, x = 2 != 0, and it's "NO".

So, based on this, the general rule is:

- If x == 0, "YES"

- Else, "NO"

But wait, in the second test case, there are "YES" outputs for x != 0.

Wait, let's look at the second test case.

Second test case:

5 5

1 2 3 4 5

Queries:

1 5

2 4

3 5

1 3

2 3

Outputs:

YES

NO

NO

YES

NO

Compute pf:

pf[0] = 0

pf[1] = 1

pf[2] = 1 XOR 2 = 3

pf[3] = 3 XOR 3 = 0

pf[4] = 0 XOR 4 = 4

pf[5] = 4 XOR 5 = 1

Query 1:

l=1, r=5

x = pf[5] XOR pf[0] = 1 XOR 0 = 1 != 0

Output: YES

Wait, according to my earlier logic, it should be "NO", but it's "YES".

So, my logic is incorrect.

Hence, I need to rethink.

Let me look at the subarray [1,2,3,4,5], x = 1.

How can it be split into k >= 2 parts with each part having XOR = 1?

Possible splits:

- [1], [2,3,4,5]: XORs are 1 and 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 5 = 3 XOR 4 XOR 5 = 3 XOR 4 = 7, then 7 XOR 5 = 2 != 1. Doesn't work.

- [1,2], [3,4,5]: XORs are 1 XOR 2 = 3 != 1. Doesn't work.

- [1,2,3], [4,5]: XORs are 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0 != 1. Doesn't work.

- [1,2,3,4], [5]: XORs are 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 0 XOR 4 = 4 != 1. Doesn't work.

So, no split possible, but the output is "YES". So, my logic is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says "it is possible to divide the array into k>1 parts so that the XOR of values from each part are equal."

In the second test case, for query 1 5, x = 1.

But I tried splitting into two parts, but none of them gave XOR = 1.

Maybe it's possible to split into more than two parts.

Let's try splitting into three parts:

- [1], [2], [3,4,5]: XORs are 1, 2, and 3 XOR 4 XOR 5 = 3 XOR 4 = 7, then 7 XOR 5 = 2 != 1. Doesn't work.

- [1], [2,3], [4,5]: XORs are 1, 2 XOR 3 = 1, and 4 XOR 5 = 1. All equal to 1. So, "YES".

Ah, so for x != 0, it's possible to split into k >= 3 parts with each part having XOR = x.

Hence, in this case, k = 3, and x = 1.

So, my earlier assumption was incorrect.

Therefore, the correct approach is:

- If x == 0, then it's possible to split into any even number of parts.

- If x != 0, then it's possible to split into any odd number of parts >= 3.

But in the second test case, for query 1 5, x = 1 != 0, and it's split into k = 3 parts, each with XOR = 1.

Hence, the general rule is:

- If x == 0, check if there exists at least one split point such that the XOR of the first part is zero and the XOR of the remaining parts is also zero.

- If x != 0, check if there exist at least two split points such that each part has XOR = x.

Wait, but in the second test case, for query 1 5, x = 1, and it's split into three parts, each with XOR = 1.

So, for x != 0, I need to find k >= 3 odd, with each part having XOR = x.

To implement this efficiently, I need a way to check for each query if such splits exist.

Let me consider storing the positions where the prefix XOR equals a certain value.

Let's precompute the prefix XOR array pf[].

Then, for each query [l, r], compute x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If x == 0:

- I need to check if there exists at least one index i in [l+1, r] such that pf[i-1] == pf[l-1].

Because then, the first part from l to i-1 has XOR zero, and the remaining part from i to r also has XOR zero.

- Additionally, for k >= 2, I need at least one such i.

If x != 0:

- I need to check if there exist at least two indices i in [l+1, r] such that pf[i-1] XOR pf[l-1] = x, and pf[r] XOR pf[i-1] = x.

Simplifying, pf[i-1] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and pf[r] = pf[l-1].

But pf[r] = pf[l-1] implies x = 0, which contradicts x != 0.

Hence, for x != 0, it's impossible to split into k >= 2 parts with equal XOR.

But in the second test case, for query 1 5, x = 1 != 0, and it's split into three parts, each with XOR = 1.

Wait, how is that possible?

Let's look again.

pf[0] = 0

pf[1] = 1

pf[2] = 1 XOR 2 = 3

pf[3] = 3 XOR 3 = 0

pf[4] = 0 XOR 4 = 4

pf[5] = 4 XOR 5 = 1

So, x = pf[5] XOR pf[0] = 1 XOR 0 = 1.

Now, to split into k parts where each part has XOR = 1.

Possible splits:

- [1], [2], [3,4,5]: XORs are 1, 2, and 3 XOR 4 XOR 5 = 3 XOR 4 = 7, 7 XOR 5 = 2 !=1. Doesn't work.

Wait, earlier I thought 3 XOR 4 XOR 5 = 3 XOR 4 = 7, 7 XOR 5 = 2, which is not 1.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me recalculate:

3 XOR 4 = 7, 7 XOR 5 = 2 !=1.

So, this split doesn't work.

Another split:

- [1,2], [3], [4,5]: XORs are 1 XOR 2 = 3 !=1, so doesn't work.

Another split:

- [1,2,3], [4], [5]: XORs are 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0 !=1, doesn't work.

Another split:

- [1], [2,3], [4,5]: XORs are 1, 2 XOR 3 = 1, and 4 XOR 5 = 1. Yes, all equal to 1.

Ah, I see.

So, [1], [2,3], [4,5] have XORs 1,1,1.

So, k=3, which is odd, and x =1.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, for x !=0, it's impossible to split into k >=2 parts with equal XOR.

But in this case, it's possible.

So, perhaps my logic is incomplete.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have x !=0, and I want to split the subarray into k >=2 parts with each part having XOR =x.

I need to find indices l = p0 < p1 < ... < pk = r+1 such that pf[p1-1] XOR pf[l-1] =x, pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p1-1] =x, ..., pf[r] XOR pf[pk-1-1] =x.

Which implies that pf[p1-1] = pf[l-1] XOR x

pf[p2-1] = pf[p1-1] XOR x = pf[l-1] XOR x XOR x = pf[l-1]

pf[p3-1] = pf[p2-1] XOR x = pf[l-1] XOR x

...

pf[r] = pf[pk-1-1] XOR x

So, the pattern alternates between pf[l-1] and pf[l-1] XOR x.

Hence, to have such a split, I need to have indices in [l, r] where pf[i-1] is either pf[l-1] or pf[l-1] XOR x.

Moreover, pf[r] should match the pattern.

So, for k parts, pf[r] should be pf[pk-1-1] XOR x.

Given that, I can check if pf[r] equals pf[l-1] if k is even, or pf[l-1] XOR x if k is odd.

But since k >=2, and for x !=0, k must be odd >=3.

Hence, pf[r] should equal pf[l-1] XOR x.

But from earlier, pf[r] = pf[l-1] XOR x.

Given that, for x !=0, I need to have pf[r] = pf[l-1] XOR x.

But pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] =x.

So, pf[r] = pf[l-1] XOR x.

Hence, this condition is always satisfied for x !=0.

But in practice, I need to ensure that there are enough split points where pf[i-1] is either pf[l-1] or pf[l-1] XOR x.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of times pf[i-1] is pf[l-1] or pf[l-1] XOR x in the range [l, r].

Then, the number of such i should be at least k, where k >=2.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for x !=0, to split into k parts, I need k-1 split points.

Each split point i must satisfy pf[i-1] == pf[l-1] XOR x.

Because then, the first part has XOR from l to i-1 equal to x.

Then, the next part from i to the next split point should have XOR x, and so on.

Wait, perhaps I need to find if there are at least k-1 split points where pf[i-1] == pf[l-1] XOR x.

But determining k is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as finding runs of pf[i-1] alternating between pf[l-1] and pf[l-1] XOR x.

Starting from pf[l-1], then pf[l-1] XOR x, then pf[l-1], and so on.

And ensure that pf[r] matches the expected value based on the number of parts.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

I recall that for a subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, it's related to the number of times a certain XOR value repeats.

Perhaps I can use the frequency of pf[i] in the range [l, r].

But time is limited, and I need an efficient solution.

Given the constraints, I need an O(n + q) solution.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to handle the queries in O(q log n) time.

Let me analyze the provided code.

In the code:

- Compute prefix XOR pf[].

- Create a map mp where keys are pf[i] and values are lists of indices where pf[i] occurs.

- For each query [l, r]:

- Compute x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

- If x == 0, output "YES".

- Else:

- Find if there exists an index i in [l+1, r] such that pf[i-1] == pf[l-1] and pf[r] == pf[l-1].

- Use bisect to find such i.

- If such i exists, output "YES", else "NO".

Wait, in the code, for x ==0, it directly outputs "YES".

For x !=0, it checks if there exists i in [l+1, r] where pf[i-1] == pf[l-1] and pf[r] == pf[i-1] XOR x.

But pf[i-1] == pf[l-1], and pf[r] == pf[i-1] XOR x = pf[l-1] XOR x.

So, it's checking if pf[r] == pf[l-1] XOR x.

But pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] =x, so pf[r] = pf[l-1] XOR x.

Hence, this condition is always true.

Therefore, the code is essentially checking if there exists i in [l+1, r] where pf[i-1] == pf[l-1].

If such an i exists, output "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the second test case, for query 1 5, x =1 !=0.

pf[l-1] = pf[0] =0.

Need to find i in [2,5] where pf[i-1] ==0.

Looking at pf:

pf[1] =1 !=0

pf[2] =3 !=0

pf[3] =0 ==0

pf[4] =4 !=0

pf[5] =1 !=0

So, i=4 is a candidate.

Then, check pf[r] == pf[i-1] XOR x =0 XOR1=1, which matches pf[5]=1.

Hence, "YES".

Another query in the second test case: 2 4

x=pf[4] XOR pf[1]=4 XOR1=5.

Check if there exists i in [3,4] where pf[i-1]==pf[1]=1.

pf[2]=3 !=1

pf[3]=0 !=1

So, no such i, hence "NO".

But according to the sample output, it's "NO".

Wait, but in the problem description, for the second test case, query 2 4 should be "NO".

Hence, the code seems correct.

Therefore, the correctness is True.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into at least two parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

### Approach

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - Compute the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` holds the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**:
   - Use a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where it occurs.

3. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query with bounds `l` and `r`:
     - Calculate the XOR of the subarray `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
     - If `x == 0`, the subarray is interesting (as it can be split into any even number of parts with zero XOR).
     - If `x != 0`, check if there exists at least one index `i` in `[l+1, r]` where `pf[i-1] == pf[l-1]`. This ensures that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

4. **Efficient Lookups**:
   - Use binary search (via `bisect` module) on the list of indices stored in the dictionary to check for the existence of required prefix XOR values efficiently.

import sys
import bisect
