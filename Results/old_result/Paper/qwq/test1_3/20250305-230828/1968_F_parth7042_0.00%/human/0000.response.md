Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array of numbers, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting subarray is one that can be divided into at least two parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR means. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is asking whether a subarray from index l to r can be split into at least two consecutive segments where each segment's XOR is equal. So, for example, if I have a subarray [1, 1, 2, 3, 0], I can split it into [1], [1], and [2, 3, 0], and the XOR of each part is 1, 1, and 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 which is also 1. So, this is an interesting subarray.

I need to figure out a way to efficiently answer multiple queries for different subarrays of the given array.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since we're dealing with XOR operations, I recall that XOR has some properties that might be useful here. One important property is that XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order of operations doesn't matter.

I also recall that the XOR of a subarray from index l to r can be computed using prefix XOR arrays. A prefix XOR array pf[i] would store the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index i.

So, pf[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i]

Then, the XOR of elements from l to r would be pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]

Okay, so I can precompute the prefix XOR array for the entire array, which would allow me to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray.

Now, for the subarray to be interesting, I need to be able to split it into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let's denote the XOR of the entire subarray from l to r as X. So, X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]

If I can find at least one index k, where l <= k < r, such that the XOR from l to k is equal to X, and the XOR from k+1 to r is also equal to X, then the subarray is interesting.

Wait, but since XOR is associative, if I have pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] = X and pf[r] XOR pf[k] = X, then I can set these equal to each other:

pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[k]

Simplifying this:

pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] XOR pf[r] XOR pf[k] = 0

Which simplifies to pf[l-1] XOR pf[r] = 0, meaning X = 0.

So, if X is 0, then any split where pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] = 0 and pf[r] XOR pf[k] = 0 would work, which simplifies to pf[k] = pf[l-1] and pf[k] = pf[r]. So, pf[l-1] must equal pf[r], which is already the case since X = 0.

But this seems too simplistic. Let me think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the XOR of the entire subarray must be equal to k times that XOR value. But since XOR is not directly additive like sum, I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I should look for repeated patterns in the XOR values.

Let me consider the cumulative XOR up to each index. So, pf[i] is the XOR from the start to i.

If I have pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = X, and I want to split the subarray into k parts where each part's XOR is X, then...

Wait, in terms of the cumulative XOR, this would mean that there are points where the cumulative XOR minus the XOR up to l-1 is a multiple of X.

But XOR doesn't directly translate to addition, so that might not help.

Let me try to think of it in terms of the properties of XOR.

Suppose I have the subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into k parts with equal XOR.

Let me denote S as the XOR of the entire subarray, which is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If I can find k-1 split points in the subarray such that the XOR of each segment between splits is equal to S, then the subarray is interesting.

But how do I find these split points efficiently?

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to handle multiple queries on large arrays, so I need a solution that's better than O(n*q).

I need a smarter way to answer each query quickly.

Let me consider precomputing some data structures or arrays that can help me answer the queries fast.

I notice that in the example, for the subarray [1,1,2,3,0], the XOR from 1 to 5 is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1. So, X = 1.

I need to check if I can split this subarray into at least two parts where each part's XOR is 1.

Looking at the subarray:

- [1] XOR = 1

- [1] XOR = 1

- [2,3,0] XOR = 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1

So, this is a valid split.

Another example from the first test case is subarray [1,2,3] with XOR = 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0.

We need to split it into at least two parts with equal XOR.

If X = 0, then we need to split it into parts where each part's XOR is 0.

Possible splits:

- [1,2] XOR = 1 XOR 2 = 3

- [3] XOR = 3

These are not equal.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says [1,2],[3] is a valid split, but 1 XOR 2 is 3, and 3 is 3, which is equal. So, in this case, X = 0, but the parts have XOR equal to 3, which is not zero. That seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood.

Wait, in the first test case, the entire array's XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1. Then, for the subarray [1,2,3], XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0.

So, X = 0.

In the explanation, it says that [1,2],[3] is a valid split because 1 XOR 2 = 3 and 3 = 3, but 3 is not equal to X=0, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the condition.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

It says that for the subarray to be interesting, it must be possible to divide it into k > 1 parts such that the XOR of each part is equal.

So, in the first test case, for the subarray [1,2,3], X = 0.

So, I need to split it into at least two parts where each part's XOR is 0.

Is [1,2],[3] a valid split? 1 XOR 2 = 3, which is not 0, so this shouldn't be a valid split.

Wait, maybe I misread the explanation.

Wait, in the first query of the first test case, x = [1,1,2,3,0], which is the entire array, and it's split into [1],[1],[2,3,0], each with XOR =1.

In the second query, subarray [1,2,3], which is a= [1,1,2,3,0], so a[1]=1, a[2]=1, a[3]=2.

Wait, in the problem, 1-based indexing is used.

Wait, in the first test case, n=5, q=5.

First query: l=1, r=5, which is the entire array [1,1,2,3,0], which is split into [1],[1],[2,3,0], each with XOR=1.

Second query: l=2, r=4, which is [1,2,3], with XOR=0.

It's split into [1,2],[3], with XOR=3 and 3, which is equal, but X=0, which is different.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the XOR of each part is equal, but not necessarily equal to X.

Wait, no, the problem says that the XOR of each part must be equal to each other, and that's y1=y2=...=yk.

But in the first test case, for the first query, X=1, and each part has XOR=1.

For the second query, X=0, and the parts have XOR=3 and 3, which are equal, even though X=0 is different.

So, perhaps the condition is that all parts have the same XOR value, regardless of what X is.

But in the explanation, it's accepted as a valid split.

So, perhaps the condition is that all parts have the same XOR value, which may or may not be equal to X.

Wait, but X is the XOR of the entire subarray.

Wait, no, in the first test case, X=1 for the first query, and parts have XOR=1.

In the second query, X=0, and parts have XOR=3, which is not equal to X, but they are equal among themselves.

So, perhaps the condition is that all parts have the same XOR value, which may or may not be equal to X.

Wait, but X is the XOR of the entire subarray, which is the XOR of the XORs of the parts.

Wait, but in XOR, if you have k parts, each with XOR = Y, then the XOR of the entire array is Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times).

If k is even, then XOR is 0, if k is odd, it's Y.

Wait, this seems problematic.

Wait, let's think about it mathematically.

Let’s say we have k parts, each with XOR = Y.

Then, the XOR of the entire array is Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times).

If k is even, this is 0.

If k is odd, this is Y.

So, in the first test case, X=1, and k=3 (odd), so X=Y=1, which matches.

In the second query, X=0, and k=2 (even), so X=0, which matches Y XOR Y =0.

So, in general, for the subarray to be interesting, it must be possible to split it into k>1 parts where each part has the same XOR Y, and X = Y if k is odd, and X=0 if k is even.

Wait, but in the second query, X=0, and k=2 (even), which matches X=0.

But in the explanation, it's accepted as a valid split where parts have Y=3, and X=0, which is different from Y.

Wait, but according to the mathematical property, X = Y if k is odd, and X=0 if k is even.

So, in the second query, k=2 (even), X=0, which matches.

In the first query, k=3 (odd), X=1, which matches Y=1.

So, in general, for the subarray to be interesting, it must be possible to split it into k>1 parts where each part has the same XOR Y, and X equals Y if k is odd, and X equals 0 if k is even.

But in the second query, Y=3, and X=0, which is consistent because k=2 is even, so X should be 0.

Wait, but Y=3 is not equal to X=0, but it's acceptable because for even k, X should be 0, regardless of Y.

So, the condition is that all parts have the same XOR Y, and X equals Y if k is odd, and X equals 0 if k is even.

But in practice, since we don't know k in advance, we need a way to check if such a split exists.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to find a better way to approach this.

I recall that for a subarray to be split into multiple parts with equal XOR, it relates to finding repeated values in the prefix XOR array.

Let me consider the prefix XOR array pf.

For the subarray from l to r, the XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

To split the subarray into k parts with equal XOR, I need to find k-1 split points where the XOR up to that point matches a certain value.

Wait, perhaps I can look for occurrences of pf[l-1] XOR Y in the prefix array between l and r.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that this problem can be solved using the properties of XOR and prefix sums.

First, compute the prefix XOR array pf, where pf[i] is the XOR of elements from the start up to index i.

Then, for a subarray from l to r, its XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, to check if this subarray can be split into at least two parts with equal XOR, I need to see if there exists at least one split point k (l <= k < r) such that the XOR from l to k is equal to the XOR from k+1 to r.

Wait, but that's not exactly right.

Actually, for multiple parts, it's more complex.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that there exists at least one split point such that the XOR from l to k is equal to the XOR from k+1 to r.

But for multiple splits, it's not just one split point.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that there are multiple split points where the XOR up to that point matches a certain value.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the total XOR of the subarray must be equal to k times that XOR, but considering the properties of XOR.

Wait, but XOR is not additive in that way.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of times a particular XOR value appears in the prefix array.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r, I need to find if there are multiple indices where the prefix XOR matches certain values.

This seems vague.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall a similar problem where we need to find subarrays with a given XOR, and we use the frequency of prefix XOR values.

Maybe I can adapt that here.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r, I need to split it into k parts with equal XOR.

Let’s denote that common XOR as Y.

Then, for k parts, the total XOR would be Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

But I need to find if there exists a Y and a k >1 such that the subarray can be split into k parts with each part's XOR equal to Y.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible Y values, but that's not efficient.

Given the constraints, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that if the subarray can be split into k parts with equal XOR, then the XOR of the entire subarray is k*Y, but considering XOR properties, which is Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, for the subarray to be interesting, its XOR must be 0 if k is even, and Y if k is odd.

But I don't know k in advance.

Wait, perhaps I can check if the XOR of the subarray is 0, which would allow splitting into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

Or if the XOR is non-zero, check if it's possible to split into an odd number of parts.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to find a different way.

I found a key insight: a subarray can be split into k parts with equal XOR if and only if there are at least k-1 positions in the subarray where the prefix XOR up to that position is equal to the target XOR Y.

Wait, perhaps I need to fix Y and find if there are enough positions where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR Y.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have the subarray from l to r.

I need to split it into k parts with equal XOR.

Let’s consider that between l and r, there are positions where the prefix XOR up to that position minus the prefix XOR up to l-1 equals the target XOR Y.

In other words, pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] = Y.

So, I need to find positions i where pf[i] = pf[l-1] XOR Y.

If I can find k-1 such positions, then I can split the subarray into k parts with equal XOR Y.

But I don't know Y in advance.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Y must be equal to the XOR of the entire subarray divided by k, but since XOR isn't divisible, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I can consider that Y is the XOR of the entire subarray if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

But that seems too simplistic.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case's first query: subarray [1,1,2,3,0], XOR is 1.

To split into k parts with XOR=1, k must be odd, and X=Y=1.

Possible splits:

- [1], [1], [2,3,0]: three parts, k=3, which is odd, and X=1=Y.

- [1,1,2], [3,0]: two parts, k=2, which is even, and X=0, but in this case, X=1, which doesn't match.

Wait, but X should be 0 if k is even, but here X=1, which doesn't match.

So, this split isn't valid.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's accepted as a valid split, but according to the mathematical property, it shouldn't be.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that all parts have equal XOR, regardless of the relationship between X and Y.

But according to the problem statement, y1=y2=...=yk, which seems to be the condition.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows for k>=2, and as long as all parts have equal XOR, it's acceptable, even if X doesn't match the expected value based on k.

But in the first test case, for the second query, l=2, r=4, subarray [1,2,3], X=0.

It's split into [1,2],[3], each with XOR=3, which are equal, so it's acceptable.

Wait, but according to the mathematical property, for k=2 (even), X should be 0, which matches.

In the first query, k=3 (odd), X=1, which matches Y=1.

So, perhaps the condition is that X equals Y if k is odd, and X equals 0 if k is even.

But in the second query, k=2, X=0, which matches.

In the first query, k=3, X=1, which matches.

So, perhaps I need to check if X=0 when k is even, and X=Y when k is odd.

But since I don't know k in advance, I need to find if there exists a k>=2 that satisfies this condition.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to find a different approach.

I found that a subarray can be split into k parts with equal XOR if and only if there are at least k-1 positions in the subarray where the prefix XOR up to that position equals pf[l-1] XOR Y.

But since Y is equal to X if k is odd, and 0 if k is even, it's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR Y, the following must hold:

- If k is even, X = 0

- If k is odd, X = Y

So, to check if such a split exists, I need to check if X=0 for even k, or X=Y for odd k.

But I still don't know Y.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Y must be a divisor of X in some way, but XOR doesn't have a division operation.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that for a subarray to be split into multiple parts with equal XOR, it's related to the frequency of certain XOR values in the prefix array.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of times a particular XOR value appears in the prefix array within the subarray range.

So, for the subarray from l to r, I can look at all the prefix XOR values between l and r and see if there are multiple indices where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR Y for some Y.

But again, without knowing Y, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, there must be at least k positions in the subarray where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR Y.

But I still don't know Y.

This seems like a dead end.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the subarray from l to r.

I need to see if I can split it into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR.

Let me consider that if the XOR of the entire subarray is 0, then it's possible to split it into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

If the XOR is non-zero, then it's possible to split it into an odd number of parts with equal XOR.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, in the first test case, for l=2 to r=4, subarray [1,2,3], XOR=0, and it's split into two parts with equal XOR=3.

Wait, but 3 XOR 3 =0, which matches X=0.

Similarly, for l=1 to r=5, XOR=1, and it's split into three parts, each with XOR=1, which matches X=1.

So, perhaps the condition is that if X=0, then it can be split into an even number of parts with equal XOR, and if X!=0, it can be split into an odd number of parts with equal XOR=Y=X.

Wait, but in the second query, X=0, and it's split into two parts with equal XOR=3, which is consistent because k=2 is even.

In this case, Y=3, and X=0, which is Y XOR Y =0, which matches X=0.

Similarly, for X=1, k=3, Y=1, which matches X=Y.

So, perhaps the general condition is:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

- If X!=0, then it's possible to split into an odd number of parts with equal XOR=Y=X.

So, to check if a subarray is interesting, I need to check if:

- X=0, and there exists at least one split point where the XOR up to that point equals the XOR of the remaining part.

- X!=0, and there exists at least two split points where the XOR up to that point equals X.

Wait, this still seems unclear.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let’s denote X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]

Then, to split the subarray into k parts with equal XOR Y, the following must hold:

- If k is even, X=0

- If k is odd, X=Y

So, to check if such a split exists with k>=2, I need to consider both even and odd k.

But since k>=2, I can consider:

- For even k: X=0, and there are at least two parts.

- For odd k: X=Y, and there are at least two parts.

But this still doesn't give me a clear way to implement it.

Let me consider that for a subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR Y, the number of positions where pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] = Y must be sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I can count the number of times pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] equals Y within the subarray.

But again, without knowing Y, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Y must be a value that divides the subarray into parts with equal XOR.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that a subarray can be split into k parts with equal XOR if and only if there are at least k-1 positions in the subarray where the prefix XOR up to that position equals pf[l-1] XOR Y.

But again, without knowing Y, this doesn't help much.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Y must be equal to X if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

So, for X=0, Y=0 for even k, and Y=0 for odd k=1, but k>=2, so for X=0, Y must be 0 for even k.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I have the subarray from l to r.

I need to split it into k parts with equal XOR.

Let’s consider that between l and r, there are positions where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR Y.

So, for each such position, I can make a split.

If I have multiple such positions, I can make multiple splits.

But again, without knowing Y, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible Y values, but that's not efficient.

Given the time constraints, I need a better way.

Let me consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the XOR of the entire subarray must be equal to k*Y, considering the XOR properties.

Wait, but XOR isn't multiplicative in that way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the XOR of k parts, each with XOR Y, is Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR Y, we must have:

- If k is odd: X = Y

- If k is even: X = 0

So, to check if such a split exists with k>=2, I need to check:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

- If X!=0, then it's possible to split into an odd number of parts with equal XOR=Y=X.

So, in the first test case, for l=1 to r=5, X=1, which is non-zero, so I need to split into an odd number of parts with each part's XOR=1.

Similarly, for l=2 to r=4, X=0, so I can split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

But I still need a way to check if such splits exist.

Let me consider that for X=0, I need to find at least one split point where the XOR up to that point equals the XOR of the remaining part.

Wait, but for X=0, the XOR of the entire subarray is 0, so I need to find at least one split point where the XOR from l to k equals the XOR from k+1 to r, which would both be 0 for even k.

Wait, but if X=0, and I split into two parts, each with XOR=0.

Or into four parts, each with XOR=0.

Similarly, for X!=0, I need to split into an odd number of parts, each with XOR=X.

This seems too vague for implementation.

Let me try to find a different approach.

I found that a subarray is interesting if its XOR can be achieved by multiple splits.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there exists at least two positions in the subarray where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR Y.

But again, without knowing Y, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for X=0, I need to find at least one position in the subarray where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1].

Because then, I can split the subarray into two parts: from l to k and from k+1 to r, each with XOR=0.

Similarly, for X!=0, I need to find at least one position where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR X.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if there exists at least one position k in the subarray where pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] = X.

Which means pf[k] = pf[l-1] XOR X.

So, for X=0, pf[k] = pf[l-1].

For X!=0, pf[k] = pf[l-1] XOR X.

So, in the subarray from l to r, I need to check if there exists at least one k where pf[k] equals pf[l-1] (for X=0) or pf[l-1] XOR X (for X!=0).

But I need to ensure that k is within [l, r).

Wait, perhaps this is the way to go.

Let me formalize it.

For a subarray from l to r:

- Compute X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]

- If X == 0:

- Check if there exists at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k] == pf[l-1]

- If such a k exists, then the subarray can be split into two parts: [l, k] with XOR=0 and [k+1, r] with XOR=0.

- If X != 0:

- Check if there exists at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k] == pf[l-1] XOR X

- If such a k exists, then the subarray can be split into an odd number of parts with each part's XOR equal to X.

Wait, but in the first test case, for l=1 to r=5, X=1, so I need to find k in [1,5) where pf[k] == pf[0] XOR 1 = 0 XOR 1 =1.

Looking at pf:

Assuming pf[0]=0

pf[1]=0 XOR 1=1

pf[2]=1 XOR 1=0

pf[3]=0 XOR 2=2

pf[4]=2 XOR 3=1

pf[5]=1 XOR 0=1

So, for X=1, I need to find k in [1,5) where pf[k]==1.

Looking at pf[1]=1, pf[4]=1.

So, k=1 or k=4.

Thus, it's possible to split into [1], [1,2,3,0] or [1,1,2,3], [0].

Wait, but in the explanation, it's split into [1],[1],[2,3,0], which is three parts.

So, perhaps this condition checks for the possibility of splitting into at least two parts.

Similarly, for l=2 to r=4, X=0, so I need to find k in [2,4) where pf[k]==pf[1]=1.

Looking at pf[2]=0, pf[3]=2.

Neither equals 1, so according to this condition, it should be "NO", but in the explanation, it's "YES".

Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, in the second query, l=2, r=4, X=0, and I need to find k in [2,4) where pf[k]==pf[1]=1.

pf[2]=0, pf[3]=2.

Neither equals 1, so according to this condition, it should be "NO", but in the explanation, it's "YES".

So, perhaps my condition is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps for X=0, I need to find at least two split points where pf[k]==pf[l-1].

But in this case, there are no such k, so it should be "NO", but the explanation says "YES".

This suggests that my condition is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider multiple splits.

Wait, maybe for X=0, I need to find at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k]==pf[l-1], and at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k]==pf[r].

But in this case, pf[r]=pf[4]=1, and pf[l-1]=pf[1]=1.

So, I need to find k in [2,4) where pf[k]==1.

pf[2]=0, pf[3]=2.

Neither equals 1, so it should be "NO", but it's "YES".

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if pf[r] == pf[l-1], which would imply that X=0, and there exists at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k] == pf[l-1].

But in this case, pf[r]=1 == pf[l-1]=1, so X=0, and there is no k in [2,4) with pf[k]=1.

But it's still "YES".

Wait, perhaps I need to check if there exists at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k] == pf[l-1], and at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k] == pf[r].

But in this case, pf[r]=1, pf[l-1]=1.

So, I need to find k in [2,4) where pf[k]=1.

But pf[2]=0, pf[3]=2.

Neither equals 1, so it should be "NO", but it's "YES".

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if pf[r] == pf[l-1], and there exists at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k] == pf[l-1].

But in this case, pf[r] == pf[l-1], but there is no k in [2,4) with pf[k]==1.

But it's still "YES", so my condition is insufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X=0, I need to find at least two split points where pf[k] == pf[l-1].

But in this case, there are no such k, but it's "YES", so that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if pf[r] == pf[l-1], and there exists at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k] == pf[l-1].

But again, in this case, pf[r]==pf[l-1], but there is no k in [2,4) with pf[k]==1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that k can be r.

Wait, k should be in [l, r), so k cannot be r.

Wait, but in the subarray [l,r], the split points are in [l, r).

So, k should be in [l, r).

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that pf[k] == pf[l-1] XOR Y.

But I'm stuck.

Let me try to look for a different approach.

I found that a subarray is interesting if its XOR is zero and it can be split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

Similarly, if its XOR is non-zero, it can be split into an odd number of parts with equal XOR.

But I need a way to check this efficiently.

Let me consider that for X=0, I need to find at least two split points where pf[k] == pf[l-1].

But in the second query, there are no such k, but it's "YES".

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X=0, I can split the subarray into any even number of parts with equal XOR.

So, perhaps I can check if there are at least two positions in the subarray where pf[k] == pf[l-1].

But again, in the second query, there are no such positions, but it's "YES".

This suggests that my condition is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if pf[r] == pf[l-1], which would imply X=0, and then check if there exists at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k] == pf[l-1].

But in the second query, pf[r]==pf[l-1], but there is no k in [l, r) with pf[k]==pf[l-1], but it's still "YES".

Wait, perhaps I need to check if pf[r] == pf[l-1], and that r - l +1 >=2.

But in this case, r - l +1 =4-2 +1=3, which is >=2.

So, perhaps for X=0, and r - l +1 >=2, it's always "YES".

But in the first test case, for l=1 to r=5, X=1, which is "YES", but according to this, it should be "YES" only if X=0.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps for X=0, and r - l +1 >=2, it's "YES".

But in the first query, X=1, which is "YES", so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X=0, it's "YES" if there exists at least one split point where pf[k] == pf[l-1].

But in the second query, there is no such k, but it's "YES".

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for X=0, it's always "YES" if r - l +1 >=2.

Because I can always split it into two parts with equal XOR=0.

Wait, but in the second query, I can split [1,2,3] into [1,2],[3], each with XOR=3, which are equal, even though pf[k] != pf[l-1].

Wait, but according to the mathematical property, for k=2 (even), X should be 0, which matches, and Y can be any value as long as Y XOR Y =0, which is satisfied for Y=3.

So, perhaps for X=0, it's always "YES" if r - l +1 >=2.

Similarly, for X!=0, it's "YES" if there exists at least one k in [l, r) where pf[k] == pf[l-1] XOR X.

In the first query, X=1, pf[l-1]=0, so pf[k] ==1, which exists at k=1 and k=4.

So, it's "YES".

In the second query, X=0, r - l +1=3 >=2, so it's "YES".

In the third query, l=3 to r=5, subarray [2,3,0], X=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=1.
