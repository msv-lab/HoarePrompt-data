Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b times the greatest common divisor of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's break it down. GCD of a and b is the greatest common divisor of a and b, which I'll denote as gcd(a, b). So, b * gcd(a, b) should divide a + b.

Let me try to rephrase that. If b * gcd(a, b) divides a + b, then there exists some integer k such that a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify this condition.

Let me consider that gcd(a, b) divides both a and b. Let's set d = gcd(a, b). Then, a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, where gcd(a1, b1) = 1.

Substituting into the condition: a + b = d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1)

And b * gcd(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1

So, the condition becomes d * (a1 + b1) is divisible by d^2 * b1.

Simplifying, this means that a1 + b1 is divisible by d * b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so what does this imply?

Wait, a1 and b1 are coprime, which means that any common divisor of a1 + b1 and b1 must divide a1 (since a1 + b1 and b1 both divide any common divisor), but since gcd(a1, b1) = 1, the only common divisor is 1.

Therefore, a1 + b1 is divisible by d * b1 only if d * b1 divides a1 + b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so b1 divides a1 + b1 implies b1 divides a1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, and b1 divides a1 only if b1 = 1.

Wait, that seems off. Let me think again.

If b1 divides a1 + b1, and a1 and b1 are coprime, then b1 divides a1 + b1.

Since b1 divides b1, it must divide a1 + b1 - b1 = a1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so b1 can only divide a1 if b1 = 1.

Therefore, b1 = 1.

So, b1 = 1, which implies that b = d * b1 = d * 1 = d.

Therefore, b = d, which is the gcd of a and b.

So, the condition simplifies to b = gcd(a, b).

But since b divides a (because gcd(a, b) divides b), this means that b divides a.

Wait, hold on. If b = gcd(a, b), and gcd(a, b) divides b, then b divides a.

So, b divides a.

Therefore, a is a multiple of b.

So, the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) simplifies to b divides a.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me verify.

If b divides a, then a = k * b for some integer k.

Then, a + b = k * b + b = (k + 1) * b.

And b * gcd(a, b) = b * b, since gcd(a, b) = b (because b divides a).

So, b * b divides (k + 1) * b.

Simplifying, b divides (k + 1).

But a = k * b, and a is a multiple of b, so k is an integer.

But (k + 1) is an integer, and b divides (k + 1) * b, which is always true.

Wait, this seems consistent.

So, the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) is equivalent to b divides a.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b divides a.

This seems much simpler.

So, now I need to find the number of pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b divides a.

This is equivalent to finding the number of multiples of b that are between 1 and n, for each b from 1 to m.

So, for each b from 1 to m, count how many multiples of b are there between 1 and n.

That is, for each b, count floor(n / b).

Then, sum these counts for b from 1 to m.

Therefore, the total number of pairs is sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m.

This seems correct.

Now, I need to compute sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m.

Given that n and m can be up to 2 * 10^6, and t (the number of test cases) can be up to 10^4, with the sum of n and m over all test cases up to 2 * 10^6, I need an efficient way to compute this sum.

A naive approach would be to iterate over each b from 1 to m and compute floor(n / b), but since m can be up to 2 * 10^6 and t up to 10^4, this would be too slow because it would be O(t * m), which could be up to 10^4 * 2 * 10^6 = 2 * 10^10 operations, which is not feasible.

Therefore, I need a faster way to compute sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m.

I recall that sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m can be computed efficiently using the technique of counting the number of times a particular value appears in the division.

Specifically, the sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m can be computed by grouping the terms where floor(n / b) is constant.

Let me explain.

For a given integer k, the number of b such that floor(n / b) = k is equal to min(floor(n / k) - floor(n / (k + 1))), for k from 1 to floor(n / 1).

But I'm not sure if I'm explaining this correctly.

Let me look up a better way to explain this.

I recall that the sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m can be computed by iterating over the possible values of floor(n / b), which is k, and finding the range of b where floor(n / b) equals k.

So, for each k, find the number of b where floor(n / b) = k, and then sum k times the number of such b.

This is a standard technique in number theory for optimizing sums involving floor functions.

To implement this efficiently, I can iterate over k from 1 to floor(n / 1), which is n, and for each k, find the range of b where floor(n / b) = k.

The range of b where floor(n / b) = k is from ceil(n / (k + 1)) + 1 to floor(n / k).

Wait, let's think carefully.

Actually, floor(n / b) = k if and only if k ≤ n / b < k + 1.

Which implies that floor(n / (k + 1)) < b ≤ floor(n / k).

Wait, no.

Wait, floor(n / b) = k if and only if k ≤ n / b < k + 1.

Which is equivalent to floor(n / (k + 1)) < b ≤ floor(n / k).

Therefore, the number of b where floor(n / b) = k is floor(n / k) - floor(n / (k + 1)).

So, the sum sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m is sum over k from 1 to floor(n / 1) of k * (floor(n / k) - floor(n / (k + 1))).

But in practice, to implement this efficiently, I can iterate k from 1 to m, and for each k, add k * (min(m, floor(n / k)) - floor(n / (k + 1))).

This way, I can compute the sum in O(m) time, but since m can be up to 2 * 10^6 and t up to 10^4, this is still too slow.

However, I can optimize this further by iterating over the possible values of floor(n / k), which is the same as iterating over the divisors of n.

Wait, no, that might not help directly.

Alternatively, I can iterate over b in blocks where floor(n / b) is constant.

Let me try to implement this technique.

I can set b_max = m

Initialize sum = 0

Set prev_b = 1

While prev_b <= b_max:

    k = floor(n / prev_b)

    Find the maximum b where floor(n / b) = k, which is min(m, floor(n / k))

    Add k * (min(m, floor(n / k)) - prev_b + 1)

    Set prev_b = floor(n / k) + 1

This way, I can compute the sum in O(sqrt(n)) time per test case, since floor(n / b) changes at most 2 * sqrt(n) times.

Given that n can be up to 2 * 10^6 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n and m over all test cases up to 2 * 10^6, this should be efficient enough.

Wait, but sum of n and m over all test cases is up to 2 * 10^6, meaning that sum of n + m over all test cases is up to 2 * 10^6, or sum of n and sum of m separately are up to 2 * 10^6?

Wait, the problem says: "It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test cases exceeds 2 * 10^6."

So, sum of n over all test cases <= 2 * 10^6, and sum of m over all test cases <= 2 * 10^6.

Therefore, the total time complexity should be O(sum of (sqrt(n) + sqrt(m)) over all test cases), which is <= O(sqrt(2 * 10^6) * t) = O(1414 * 10^4) = O(1.414 * 10^8), which is acceptable.

But actually, since n and m are up to 2 * 10^6, and t up to 10^4, but sum of n and sum of m over all test cases <= 2 * 10^6, this means that the total time should be acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps precomputing some values or using other optimizations.

But I need to implement this efficiently.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for i in range(t):

        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())

        count = 2

        ans = n

        while count <= m:

            countmins = int(count - 1)

            g = int(n / count)

            if g < countmins:

                break

            g -= countmins

            ans += int(g / count) + 1

            count += 1

        print(int(ans))

This seems to be attempting to compute the sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m.

Let's see.

It initializes ans = n, which is sum floor(n / b) for b = 1.

Then, it starts a loop with count from 2 to m.

In each iteration, it computes g = floor(n / count), then sets g -= count - 1, which is g = floor(n / count) - (count - 1).

Then, ans += floor(g / count) + 1.

This seems unclear to me.

Let me try to understand what this code is doing.

For b = 1, it initializes ans = n, which is correct because floor(n / 1) = n.

Then, for b from 2 to m, it tries to add some value to ans.

But the way it's computing g and then adding floor(g / count) + 1 seems off.

Let me try to compute the sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m in a different way.

I'll try to implement the optimized version I thought earlier.

Here's how I would implement it:

def sum_n_over_b(n, m):

    sum = 0

    b = 1

    while b <= m:

        k = n // b

        next_b = n // (k - 1) if k > 1 else m + 1

        sum += k * (min(m, next_b - 1) - b + 1)

        b = next_b

    return sum

This function computes the sum floor(n / b) for b from 1 to m efficiently.

But let's see if the given code is doing something similar.

In the given code:

count starts from 2, ans initialized to n.

while count <= m:

    countmins = int(count - 1)

    g = int(n / count)

    if g < countmins:

        break

    g -= countmins

    ans += int(g / count) + 1

    count += 1

This seems to be trying to group some b's together, but it's not clear.

Let me try to compute this for one of the examples.

Take n = 10, m = 8.

According to the note, the valid pairs are:

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

That's 14 pairs.

So, sum floor(10 / b) for b from 1 to 8 should be 14.

Let's compute it manually:

floor(10 / 1) = 10

floor(10 / 2) = 5

floor(10 / 3) = 3

floor(10 / 4) = 2

floor(10 / 5) = 2

floor(10 / 6) = 1

floor(10 / 7) = 1

floor(10 / 8) = 1

Sum: 10 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25

Wait, but according to the note, there are 14 valid pairs, but according to this, sum floor(10 / b) for b from 1 to 8 is 25.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, earlier I thought that the condition was b divides a, which would mean that the number of a for each b is floor(n / b).

So, for n = 10, m = 8, sum floor(10 / b) for b from 1 to 8 is 25, but according to the note, there are only 14 valid pairs.

This suggests that my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying the condition.

Let me revisit the condition: a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

I earlier concluded that this is equivalent to b divides a.

But according to the example, that doesn't seem to hold.

Wait, in the note for the fourth test case (n=10, m=8), there are 14 valid pairs, but sum floor(10 / b) for b from 1 to 8 is 25, which is different.

This suggests that my simplification is wrong.

Let me double-check the condition.

Given a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Let d = gcd(a, b).

Then a = d * a1, b = d * b1, with gcd(a1, b1) = 1.

Substitute into the condition:

a + b = d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1)

b * gcd(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1

So, d * (a1 + b1) must be divisible by d^2 * b1.

Simplify: a1 + b1 must be divisible by d * b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime.

So, b1 divides a1 + b1.

Since b1 divides b1, and a1 and b1 are coprime, b1 divides a1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so b1 must be 1.

Therefore, b1 = 1.

Thus, b = d * b1 = d * 1 = d, meaning b = d, which is gcd(a, b).

So, b = gcd(a, b).

This implies that b divides a, since gcd(a, b) divides a.

Wait, but in the example, sum floor(10 / b) for b from 1 to 8 is 25, but there are only 14 valid pairs.

So, perhaps not all pairs where b divides a satisfy the condition.

Wait, maybe I need to revisit the condition.

Given that b = gcd(a, b), not just b divides a.

Wait, but gcd(a, b) divides b, so if b = gcd(a, b), then b divides a.

But in the example, sum floor(10 / b) is 25, but only 14 pairs satisfy the condition.

This suggests that not all pairs where b divides a satisfy b = gcd(a, b).

Wait, for example, take a = 6, b = 2.

Here, b divides a, but gcd(a, b) = 2, which equals b.

So, this pair should satisfy the condition.

Wait, but in the note, for n=10, m=8, there are 14 pairs, but sum floor(10 / b) is 25.

This suggests that some pairs where b divides a do not satisfy b = gcd(a, b).

Wait, is that possible?

Wait, if b divides a, then gcd(a, b) = b, so b = b, which is always true.

Wait, that seems correct.

So, perhaps my earlier conclusion is correct: the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) is equivalent to b divides a.

But according to the example, sum floor(10 / b) is 25, but only 14 pairs satisfy the condition.

This inconsistency suggests that my simplification is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Given that a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b), and I set d = gcd(a, b), a = d * a1, b = d * b1, with gcd(a1, b1) = 1.

Then, a + b = d * (a1 + b1), and b * d = d^2 * b1.

So, d * (a1 + b1) is divisible by d^2 * b1.

This implies that a1 + b1 is divisible by d * b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so b1 divides a1 + b1 implies b1 divides a1.

Since a1 and b1 are coprime, b1 must be 1.

Therefore, b1 = 1, which means b = d * 1 = d, so b = d = gcd(a, b).

Thus, b = gcd(a, b).

But since gcd(a, b) divides b, this again implies that b divides a.

Wait, but in the example, sum floor(10 / b) is 25, but only 14 pairs satisfy the condition.

This suggests that my conclusion is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that b = gcd(a, b) is equivalent to b divides a and for every prime p, the exponent of p in b is equal to the exponent of p in gcd(a, b).

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach.

Let me look at the condition again: a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Given a = k * b, since b divides a, then a + b = (k + 1) * b.

So, (k + 1) * b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) = b * b.

Therefore, (k + 1) * b is divisible by b * b, which simplifies to (k + 1) is divisible by b.

But k = a / b, and since a <= n, k <= n / b.

So, for each b, k can be from 1 to floor(n / b), and for each k, (k + 1) must be divisible by b.

So, for each b, the number of k where 1 <= k <= floor(n / b) and b divides (k + 1).

This is equivalent to counting the number of k where k ≡ -1 mod b, and 1 <= k <= floor(n / b).

So, k = b * t - 1, for some integer t, and k >=1.

We need to find the number of t where t >= (1 + 1)/b and t <= (floor(n / b) + 1)/b.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, for each b, the number of k where 1 <= k <= floor(n / b) and b divides (k + 1) is equal to floor(n / b / b).

Wait, let's see.

Given that k + 1 is divisible by b, so k = b * t - 1, for t >= 1.

We need k <= floor(n / b), so b * t - 1 <= floor(n / b).

Thus, t <= (floor(n / b) + 1)/b.

So, the number of t is floor((floor(n / b) + 1)/b).

But this seems inefficient to compute for each b separately.

Alternatively, the number of k where 1 <= k <= floor(n / b) and k ≡ -1 mod b is equal to floor((floor(n / b) + 1)/b).

So, for each b, add floor((floor(n / b) + 1)/b) to the answer.

This seems too slow for large n and m.

I need a better way to compute this sum.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for each b, the number of k where 1 <= k <= floor(n / b) and k ≡ -1 mod b is equal to floor((n / b + 1)/b).

But n / b can be large, so this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of t and count the number of b where b <= m and b divides (k + 1), with k = t.

Wait, this seems too vague.

Let me try to find a better approach.

I recall that sum floor((n / b) + 1)/b) for b from 1 to m can be optimized using the same technique as sum floor(n / b).

Specifically, I can iterate over the possible values of floor((n / b) + 1)/b) and find the range of b where this value is constant.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that floor((n / b) + 1)/b) = floor(n / b^2 / b) + floor(1 / b).

But this seems even more complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that this sum cannot be computed as efficiently as sum floor(n / b), and look for another approach.

Let me consider that for each b, I need to count the number of a where 1 <= a <= n, a ≡ -1 mod b.

Wait, since a = k * b, and k ≡ -1 mod b, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no.

Given that a = k * b, and k ≡ -1 mod b, which would mean k = t * b - 1 for some integer t.

But k must be at least 1, so t >= ceil(1 + 1 / b), which is t >= 1.

And k <= floor(n / b).

So, t <= floor(floor(n / b) + 1)/b).

This seems too convoluted.

Perhaps I need to consider that for each b, the number of a where a ≡ -1 mod b and 1 <= a <= n.

Wait, a ≡ -1 mod b means a ≡ b - 1 mod b.

So, a ≡ (b - 1) mod b.

The number of a in 1 to n where a ≡ (b - 1) mod b.

This is equal to floor((n - (b - 1)) / b) + 1, provided that b - 1 <= n.

Wait, let's see.

The general formula for the number of a in 1 to n where a ≡ r mod m is floor((n - r)/m) + 1, provided that r < m.

In this case, m = b, r = b - 1.

So, number of a where a ≡ b - 1 mod b is floor((n - (b - 1))/b) + 1, provided that b - 1 < b, which is always true.

So, for each b, the number of a where a ≡ b - 1 mod b and 1 <= a <= n is floor((n - b + 1)/b) + 1.

Therefore, the total number of valid pairs is sum from b=1 to m of floor((n - b + 1)/b) + 1.

This seems promising.

Now, I need to compute sum from b=1 to m of floor((n - b + 1)/b) + 1.

This can be split into sum floor((n - b + 1)/b) + sum 1, which is sum floor((n - b + 1)/b) + m.

But I need to find a way to compute sum floor((n - b + 1)/
