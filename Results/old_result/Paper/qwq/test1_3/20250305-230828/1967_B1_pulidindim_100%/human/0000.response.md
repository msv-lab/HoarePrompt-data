Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b times the greatest common divisor of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's break it down. GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, which is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. So, gcd(a, b) is that number.

The condition is that a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b). In mathematical terms, that means (a + b) mod (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0.

Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can simplify this condition.

Let me think about the properties involved. Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, a can be expressed as a = d * a1, and b can be expressed as b = d * b1, where a1 and b1 are coprime integers (since d is the greatest common divisor).

Substituting these into the condition:

a + b = d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1)

And b * gcd(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1

So, the condition becomes:

d * (a1 + b1) should be divisible by d^2 * b1.

Simplifying, we can divide both numerator and denominator by d:

(a1 + b1) should be divisible by d * b1.

But wait, a1 and b1 are coprime, meaning gcd(a1, b1) = 1.

Let me see if I can find a relationship here.

Alternatively, maybe I can look at the ratio (a + b) / (b * gcd(a, b)) and see when this is an integer.

Given that, let's see:

(a + b) / (b * gcd(a, b)) = (d * a1 + d * b1) / (d * b1 * d) = (d (a1 + b1)) / (d^2 * b1) = (a1 + b1) / (d * b1)

For this to be an integer, d * b1 must divide (a1 + b1).

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so b1 and a1 are coprime.

Wait, b1 divides a1 + b1. Since b1 and a1 are coprime, b1 must divide a1 + b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, meaning b1 doesn't share any prime factors with a1.

So, b1 divides a1 + b1 implies that b1 divides a1, but since a1 and b1 are coprime, the only way b1 divides a1 is if b1 = 1.

Wait, that seems off. If b1 divides a1 + b1 and b1 and a1 are coprime, then b1 must divide a1 + b1.

But a1 + b1 = k * b1 for some integer k.

Then, a1 = (k - 1) * b1.

But since a1 and b1 are coprime, and a1 is a multiple of b1 only if b1 = 1.

Wait, that suggests that b1 can only be 1.

If b1 = 1, then b = d * 1 = d.

And a = d * a1, with a1 and 1 being coprime, which is always true since 1 is coprime with any number.

So, in this case, a is a multiple of d, and b = d.

Given that, let's see what this means for a and b.

Given b = d, and a is a multiple of d.

Wait, but d = gcd(a, b), and b = d, so b divides a.

So, b divides a, meaning a is a multiple of b.

Wait, that seems like a useful simplification.

So, if b divides a, then a is a multiple of b.

Let me see if that's generally the case.

Wait, in the above, I assumed b1 = 1, which led to b divides a.

But is that always the case?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider other values of b1.

Wait, perhaps b1 can be greater than 1.

Let me try plugging in some numbers.

Take a = 2, b = 2.

Then, gcd(a, b) = 2.

a + b = 4.

b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4.

4 is divisible by 4, so (2, 2) is a valid pair.

Now, a = 3, b = 1.

gcd(3, 1) = 1.

a + b = 4.

b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1.

4 is divisible by 1, so (3, 1) is valid.

a = 4, b = 2.

gcd(4, 2) = 2.

a + b = 6.

b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4.

6 is not divisible by 4, so (4, 2) is invalid.

Wait, but earlier in the example, (6, 2) was included in the valid pairs.

Wait, in the fourth test case, (6,2) is listed as valid.

Wait, let's check:

a = 6, b = 2.

gcd(6,2) = 2.

a + b = 8.

b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4.

8 is divisible by 4, so yes, (6,2) is valid.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, if b divides a, then a is a multiple of b.

In this case, 2 divides 6, and indeed, (6,2) is valid.

But in the earlier case, a = 4, b = 2, 2 divides 4, but 4 + 2 = 6 is not divisible by 2 * 2 = 4.

Wait, 6 is not divisible by 4, so (4,2) is invalid.

But according to the note, in the fourth test case, (6,2) is valid, but (4,2) is not.

So, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Let me see.

Wait, maybe the condition is that b divides a and (a/b + 1) divides b.

Wait, that might not be it.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find when a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

Given that b divides a (from earlier), let's set a = k * b, where k is an integer.

Then, a + b = k * b + b = b * (k + 1).

And b * gcd(a, b) = b * gcd(k * b, b) = b * b, since gcd(k * b, b) = b.

So, a + b = b * (k + 1), and b * gcd(a, b) = b * b.

So, the condition is that b * (k + 1) is divisible by b * b.

Simplifying, k + 1 must be divisible by b.

Because b * (k + 1) / (b * b) = (k + 1) / b.

For this to be an integer, b must divide (k + 1).

So, in other words, k + 1 is a multiple of b.

But k = a / b, so k is an integer since b divides a.

So, k + 1 is an integer, and it must be divisible by b.

Therefore, for a given b, k must be such that k + 1 is a multiple of b.

That is, k ≡ -1 mod b.

Since k = a / b, we have a = k * b.

So, a = (some multiple of b - 1) * b.

Wait, that seems a bit convoluted.

Let me try to rephrase.

Given that a = k * b, and k + 1 is a multiple of b, then k ≡ -1 mod b.

So, k = b * t - 1, for some integer t.

Then, a = k * b = (b * t - 1) * b = b^2 * t - b.

So, a = b^2 * t - b.

Given that a must be positive and ≤ n, we can find the range of t such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n.

Similarly, b must be ≤ m.

This seems like a way to parameterize the valid pairs (a, b).

But I need to make sure that this covers all possible cases.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider fixing b and finding for each b, how many a satisfy the condition.

Given b, we need to find a such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

Given that gcd(a, b) divides a and b, and b * gcd(a, b) divides a + b.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of multiples.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of b and find for each b, the number of a that satisfy the condition.

But given the constraints, n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and t can be up to 10^4, with the sum of n and m across all test cases up to 2*10^6, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Probably, O(t * m) would be too slow, so I need something faster, maybe O(t * log m) or something like that.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula that allows me to compute the number of valid pairs efficiently.

Let me consider fixing b and finding for each b, the number of a that satisfy the condition.

So, for a fixed b, I need to find the number of a in [1, n] such that a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

Given that, and knowing that gcd(a, b) divides a, perhaps I can iterate over possible divisors of b.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the divisors of b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of gcd(a, b).

Let d = gcd(a, b).

Then, a = d * a1, b = d * b1, with a1 and b1 coprime.

Substituting back, a + b = d * (a1 + b1), and b * gcd(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1.

So, d * (a1 + b1) must be divisible by d^2 * b1.

Simplifying, a1 + b1 must be divisible by d * b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so a1 + b1 and b1 are coprime except for the common factor of b1.

Wait, no, a1 and b1 are coprime, but a1 + b1 and b1 may share common factors.

Wait, a1 + b1 can be divisible by b1 if a1 is a multiple of b1, but since a1 and b1 are coprime, a1 cannot be a multiple of b1 unless b1 = 1.

Wait, unless b1 divides a1, but since they are coprime, b1 = 1.

So, perhaps the only way for a1 + b1 to be divisible by b1 is if b1 = 1.

Wait, but that can't be, because in the example, (6,2) is valid, and for b=2, b1=2/d, but I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

Which means that b * gcd(a, b) divides a + b.

Which implies that gcd(a, b) divides (a + b)/b.

Wait, but (a + b)/b = a/b + 1.

But gcd(a, b) divides a and b, so it divides a/b if a is a multiple of b.

Wait, but a/b may not be an integer if b does not divide a.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of modular arithmetic.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that since gcd(a, b) divides a and b, it divides a + b.

So, gcd(a, b) divides a + b.

Moreover, b * gcd(a, b) divides a + b.

So, b * gcd(a, b) divides a + b.

Given that gcd(a, b) divides a + b, and b divides a + b (since a + b = a + b), wait no, b divides a + b only if a is a multiple of b.

Wait, no, b divides a + b if and only if b divides a.

Because a + b ≡ a mod b.

So, b divides a + b if and only if b divides a.

Wait, that seems useful.

So, if b divides a, then b divides a + b.

Otherwise, not.

But in our condition, b * gcd(a, b) divides a + b.

If b divides a, then a = k * b for some integer k.

Then, a + b = k * b + b = (k + 1) * b.

And b * gcd(a, b) = b * gcd(k * b, b) = b * b.

So, (k + 1) * b must be divisible by b * b, which simplifies to (k + 1) must be divisible by b.

Therefore, k + 1 ≡ 0 mod b, or k ≡ -1 mod b.

So, k = t * b - 1 for some integer t.

Thus, a = k * b = (t * b - 1) * b = t * b^2 - b.

So, a = t * b^2 - b.

Given that a must be ≥1 and ≤n, we can find the range of t such that 1 ≤ t * b^2 - b ≤ n.

Solving for t:

1 ≤ t * b^2 - b ≤ n

Adding b to all parts:

1 + b ≤ t * b^2 ≤ n + b

Dividing by b^2:

(1 + b)/b^2 ≤ t ≤ (n + b)/b^2

Since t must be an integer, t starts from ceil((1 + b)/b^2) up to floor((n + b)/b^2).

But b^2 is b squared, and since b ≥1, b^2 ≥1.

Wait, for b=1, b^2=1.

For b=2, b^2=4.

Wait, but t must be an integer ≥1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of t as any integer that makes a positive.

Given a = t * b^2 - b, we need a ≥1, which implies t * b^2 - b ≥1, so t * b^2 ≥ b +1, hence t ≥ ceil((b +1)/b^2).

Similarly, for a ≤n, t * b^2 - b ≤n, so t ≤ floor((n + b)/b^2).

So, t ranges from ceil((b +1)/b^2) to floor((n + b)/b^2).

But (b +1)/b^2 can be less than 1 for b >1, so t starts from 1.

Wait, for b=1:

t ≥ ceil((1 +1)/1^2) = ceil(2/1) =2

For b=2:

t ≥ ceil((2 +1)/4) = ceil(3/4) =1

So, for b=1, t starts from 2.

For b≥2, t starts from 1.

Wait, that seems a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that a = t * b^2 - b, and find t such that a is in [1, n].

So, for each b from 1 to m, and for each valid t, a = t * b^2 - b, and ensure that a ≤n.

Also, a must be ≥1.

So, for each b from 1 to m:

if b > n, skip, since a ≤n.

else:

t_min = ceil((1 + b)/b^2)

t_max = floor((n + b)/b^2)

number of t for this b is t_max - t_min +1

But this seems a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over b, and for each b, compute the number of a in [1, n] that satisfy a = t * b^2 - b.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me see.

Given a = t * b^2 - b, and a ≤n, then t ≤ floor((n + b)/b^2)

And t ≥ ceil((1 + b)/b^2)

So, for each b, the number of t is floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1

But this seems inefficient for large m and n.

Given that n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n and m across all test cases up to 2*10^6, I need a faster way.

Perhaps I can iterate over b from 1 to m, and for each b, compute the number of a in [1, n] that satisfy a = k * b - b, where k is an integer ≥1.

Wait, that might not be it.

Wait, going back, perhaps I can consider that a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b), and try to find a relationship that allows me to count the pairs efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of gcd(a, b), and for each gcd, iterate over possible b, and find corresponding a.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each b, the number of a that satisfy the condition is floor(n / b) - something.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider small values of b and see if I can find a pattern.

Take b=1:

Then, a +1 must be divisible by 1 * gcd(a,1) =1 *1 =1.

Since any number is divisible by 1, all a from 1 to n are valid.

So, for b=1, the number of valid a is n.

Take b=2:

a +2 must be divisible by 2 * gcd(a,2).

Now, gcd(a,2) can be 1 or 2, depending on whether a is odd or even.

If a is even, gcd(a,2)=2.

Then, a +2 must be divisible by 2*2=4.

If a is odd, gcd(a,2)=1.

Then, a +2 must be divisible by 2*1=2.

But any a +2 is divisible by 2, since a +2 is even.

Therefore, for b=2, all a are valid if a is odd, and a is even and a +2 is divisible by 4.

Wait, so for a even, a +2 divisible by 4.

Let a =2k.

Then, a +2=2k +2=2(k +1).

This needs to be divisible by 4, so 2(k +1) divisible by 4 implies that k +1 is even, so k is odd.

Therefore, a =2*(2m +1) =4m +2.

So, for b=2, all odd a are valid, and even a of the form 4m +2.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=10, m=8.

For b=2, a can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

For a=1: gcd(1,2)=1, 1+2=3, 3 divisible by 2*1=2? 3 is not divisible by 2, so invalid.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, a=1 is odd, and a +b=3 should be divisible by 2, which it is not.

Wait, maybe I messed up.

Wait, no, 3 is divisible by 2? No, 3 mod 2 =1, so not divisible.

But according to the note, (1,2) is not in the valid list.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, the valid pairs are:

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

So, (1,2) is not valid, which matches the calculation.

Similarly, a=2: gcd(2,2)=2, a+b=4, 4 divisible by 2*2=4? Yes, 4 divisible by 4.

a=3: gcd(3,2)=1, a+b=5, 5 divisible by 2*1=2? 5 mod 2=1, no.

a=4: gcd(4,2)=2, a+b=6, 6 divisible by 2*2=4? 6 mod 4=2, no.

a=5: gcd(5,2)=1, a+b=7, 7 divisible by 2*1=2? 7 mod 2=1, no.

a=6: gcd(6,2)=2, a+b=8, 8 divisible by 2*2=4? Yes, 8 mod 4=0.

a=7: gcd(7,2)=1, a+b=9, 9 divisible by 2*1=2? 9 mod 2=1, no.

a=8: gcd(8,2)=2, a+b=10, 10 divisible by 2*2=4? 10 mod 4=2, no.

a=9: gcd(9,2)=1, a+b=11, 11 mod 2=1, no.

a=10: gcd(10,2)=2, a+b=12, 12 mod 4=0, yes.

So, for b=2, only a=2,6,10 are valid.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for b=2, a must be of the form 4m +2 when a is even.

Let me check:

a=2: 2=4*0 +2

a=6: 6=4*1 +2

a=10:10=4*2 +2

So, yes, that matches.

And for a odd, none are valid, which matches my earlier calculation.

Wait, but in the note, (2,2),(6,2),(10,2) are valid, which matches this pattern.

So, for b=2, the valid a are those where a is even and a +2 is divisible by 4, which is a=4m +2.

Similarly, for b=1, all a are valid.

For b=3, let's see.

gcd(a,3) can be 1 or 3.

If gcd(a,3)=1, then a +3 must be divisible by 3*1=3.

So, a +3 divisible by 3, which means a divisible by 3.

But gcd(a,3)=1 implies a not divisible by 3, so no solutions in this case.

Wait, but a +3 divisible by 3 implies a divisible by 3, which contradicts gcd(a,3)=1.

Therefore, only solutions are when gcd(a,3)=3, i.e., a is divisible by 3.

Then, a +3 is divisible by 3*3=9.

So, a +3 must be divisible by 9.

Given a is divisible by 3, let a=3k.

Then, a +3=3k +3=3(k +1), which needs to be divisible by 9.

So, 3(k +1) divisible by 9 implies k +1 divisible by 3, so k ≡2 mod 3.

Thus, a=3*(3m +2)=9m +6.

So, for b=3, a must be of the form 9m +6.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, m=8, n=10.

So, a can be 6 or 15, but 15 >10, so only a=6 is valid.

Indeed, in the note, (6,3) is valid.

Similarly, for b=4.

gcd(a,4) can be 1,2, or 4.

If gcd(a,4)=1:

a +4 divisible by 4*1=4.

a +4 divisible by 4, which means a divisible by 4.

But gcd(a,4)=1 implies a not divisible by 2, contradiction.

So, no solutions in this case.

If gcd(a,4)=2:

a is divisible by 2 but not by 4.

Then, a +4 divisible by 4*2=8.

a=2 mod 4.

Then, a +4=6 mod 8.

Which is not divisible by 8, so no solutions here.

If gcd(a,4)=4:

a is divisible by 4.

Let a=4k.

Then, a +4=4k +4=4(k +1), which needs to be divisible by 4*4=16.

So, 4(k +1) divisible by 16 implies k +1 divisible by 4, so k=4m +3.

Thus, a=4*(4m +3)=16m +12.

In n=10, a=12 and 28, but 12 >10, so no valid a for b=4.

Hence, for b=4, no valid a in n=10.

Similarly, for higher b, up to b=8.

This seems tedious.

Is there a pattern here?

It seems that for each b, the valid a are in an arithmetic progression with period b^2.

From earlier, a = t * b^2 - b.

Wait, but in the case of b=2, a=4m +2, which is period 4, which is b^2.

Similarly, for b=3, a=9m +6, period 9, which is b^2.

For b=1, a =1*1*t -1= t -1.

Wait, that gives a=0 for t=1, which is invalid since a ≥1.

Wait, perhaps my formula is off.

Wait, for b=1, a=t*1^2 -1=t -1.

But t must be ≥ ceil((1 +1)/1)=2, so a=t -1 ≥1.

So, a=1,2,3,...,n.

Which matches that for b=1, all a are valid.

Similarly, for b=2, a=4m +2.

Which is t*4 -2, but t*4 -2=4t -2.

For t=1, a=2; t=2, a=6; t=3, a=10; etc.

Which matches the earlier observation.

Similarly, for b=3, a=9m +6.

So, a=b^2 * t - b.

Which matches the general formula.

Hence, for each b, the number of valid a is floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1.

But computing this for each b separately would be O(m), which is too slow for m up to 2*10^6.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, and the sum of m and n across all test cases up to 2*10^6, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can iterate over b, and for each b, compute the number of t such that a = t * b^2 - b is in [1, n].

But this seems O(m), which is too slow.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over t and find the range of b for which a = t * b^2 - b is ≤n.

Wait, that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over b in a way that groups b with the same b^2, but since b^2 is unique for each b, that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b up to sqrt(n), since b^2 <=n implies b <=sqrt(n).

Wait, but b can be up to m, which is up to 2*10^6, so sqrt(n) can be up to around 1414 for n=2*10^6.

But m can be up to 2*10^6, but in practice, b^2 can be up to m^2, but a is up to n.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b up to min(m, sqrt(n)), and handle the rest separately.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that a = t * b^2 - b.

This can be rearranged to t = (a + b)/b^2.

But t must be an integer.

So, (a + b) must be divisible by b^2.

So, a + b ≡0 mod b^2, which means a ≡ -b mod b^2.

So, a = k * b^2 - b, for some integer k ≥1.

Given that a ≥1, k * b^2 - b ≥1 ⇒ k ≥ ceil((1 + b)/b^2).

And a ≤n, k * b^2 - b ≤n ⇒ k ≤ floor((n + b)/b^2).

So, for each b, the number of k is floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1.

But computing this for each b separately is too slow for large m.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can iterate over k and find the range of b for which a = k * b^2 - b ≤n.

Wait, that might be possible.

Let me see.

Given a = k * b^2 - b ≤n, we can solve for b.

k * b^2 - b - n ≤0.

This is a quadratic in b: k * b^2 - b - n ≤0.

The roots are b = (1 ± sqrt(1 + 4 * k * n)) / (2 * k).

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over k and find the maximum b for which a = k * b^2 - b ≤n.

But this seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b and find the number of a in [1, n] that satisfy a ≡ -b mod b^2.

This is equivalent to a ≡ b^2 - b mod b^2.

Wait, because a ≡ -b mod b^2.

So, a ≡ b^2 - b mod b^2.

But b^2 ≡0 mod b^2, so a ≡ -b mod b^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of residues.

The number of a in [1, n] such that a ≡ -b mod b^2.

This is an arithmetic sequence: a = m * b^2 - b, for m ≥1, such that a ≤n.

Which is similar to what I had earlier.

But again, iterating over b and computing floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1 is too slow for large m.

I need a better way.

Perhaps I can iterate over b in a way that groups multiple b together.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b in increasing order and keep track of the current a.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible b^2, since b^2 is the period.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible periods, which are perfect squares up to m^2.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b and accumulate the count, but optimize it using some mathematical insight.

Let me consider that for each b, the number of a is floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1.

Let me denote c_b = ceil((1 + b)/b^2), and d_b = floor((n + b)/b^2).

Then, the number of a for each b is d_b - c_b +1.

But computing this for each b is too slow.

Perhaps I can find a way to compute c_b and d_b efficiently in bulk.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b in decreasing order and use a sliding window.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for b from 1 to m, the term b^2 increases, so the number of t decreases.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b and compute the number of a using integer division.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that floor(n / k) can be computed efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it this way:

Let me denote p = b^2.

Then, floor((n + b)/p) - ceil((1 + b)/p) +1.

But p = b^2.

So, for each b, p = b^2, and I can compute floor((n + b)/p) - ceil((1 + b)/p) +1.

But this still requires iterating over each b.

Is there a way to optimize this sum?

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over p = b^2, and sum over p.

But p must be a perfect square, and b must be integers.

This seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over k = ceil((1 + b)/b^2) to floor((n + b)/b^2), but that still requires iterating over b.

Wait, perhaps I can find an upper bound for b such that b^2 <=n +b.

Since a = t * b^2 - b <=n, so t * b^2 <=n +b.

Assuming t >=1, then b^2 <=n +b.

But b^2 <=n +b implies b <= (1 + sqrt(1 + 4n))/2.

Which is approximately sqrt(n).

So, b <= sqrt(n).

Given that n can be up to 2*10^6, sqrt(n) is up to around 1414.

So, b can be up to min(m, 1414).

Wait, but m can be up to 2*10^6, but b <= sqrt(n +b).

Wait, but n can be up to 2*10^6, and m up to 2*10^6.

But b <= min(m, sqrt(n +b)).

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate b up to sqrt(n), since b^2 <=n +b, which is approximately b <= sqrt(n).

So, for m >= sqrt(n), the number of b is up to sqrt(n), which is manageable.

For m < sqrt(n), b goes up to m.

So, in either case, the number of b is up to sqrt(n), which is acceptable for time constraints.

Therefore, perhaps I can iterate b from 1 to min(m, sqrt(n)), and for each b, compute the number of a as floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1.

Then, sum over all b from 1 to min(m, sqrt(n)).

But in practice, since n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n and m across all test cases up to 2*10^6, this should be efficient enough.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over b in a way that groups multiple b with the same b^2.

But since b^2 is unique for each b, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over k and find the range of b for which a = k * b^2 - b <=n.

But this seems more complicated.

Given time constraints, perhaps the initial approach is acceptable.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

count = 2

ans = n

while count <= m:

countmins = int(count - 1)

g = int(n / count)

if g < countmins:

break

g -= countmins

ans += int(g / count) + 1

count += 1

print(int(ans))

So, it takes t, the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and m.

Then, it initializes count to 2 and ans to n.

Then, it enters a loop while count <= m.

Inside the loop:

- countmins = count -1

- g = n / count

- if g < countmins, break

- g -= countmins

- ans += int(g / count) +1

- count +=1

Finally, it prints ans.

Wait, this seems different from what I derived.

In my derivation, for each b from 1 to m, especially up to sqrt(n), I need to compute floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1.

But in the code, it seems to be iterating count from 2 to m, and updating ans accordingly.

Wait, perhaps count corresponds to b in my notation.

Let's see.

If count = b, then:

countmins = b -1

g = n / b

if g < countmins, break

g -= countmins

ans += int(g / b) +1

Then, b starts from 2, since count starts from 2, and b=1 is handled separately, as ans = n.

So, for b=1, ans =n, which matches that for b=1, all a from 1 to n are valid.

Then, for b from 2 to m:

compute floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1, and add to ans.

But in the code, it's adding int(g / b) +1, where g = n / b - (b -1).

Wait, let's see:

g = n / b

g -= countmins = b -1

So, g = n / b - (b -1)

Then, int(g / b) +1 = floor((n / b - b +1)/b) +1 = floor(n / b^2 -1 +1/b) +1

But 1/b is less than 1 for b >=2, so floor(n / b^2 -1 +1/b) = floor(n / b^2 -1) = floor(n / b^2) -1 (if n / b^2 is not integer)

But this seems different from floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1.

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical equivalence.

Let me try to compute floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1.

First, floor((n + b)/b^2) = floor(n / b^2 + 1 / b) = floor(n / b^2) + floor(1 / b) = floor(n / b^2), since floor(1 / b) =0 for b >=2.

Similarly, ceil((1 + b)/b^2) = ceil(1 / b^2 + b / b^2) = ceil(1 / b^2 + 1 / b).

For b >=2, 1 / b^2 + 1 / b < 1, so ceil(1 / b^2 + 1 / b) =1.

Therefore, floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1 = floor(n / b^2) -1 +1 = floor(n / b^2).

But according to my earlier analysis, the number of a for each b is floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1.

But according to this, it's floor(n / b^2).

But in the code, it's adding int(g / b) +1, where g = n / b - (b -1).

Wait, perhaps I need to compute g / b.

g = n / b - (b -1)

g / b = (n / b - b +1)/b = n / b^2 -1 +1/b

floor(g / b) +1 = floor(n / b^2 -1 +1/b) +1

For b >=2, 1/b <1, so floor(n / b^2 -1 +1/b) = floor(n / b^2 -1) = floor(n / b^2) -1 (if n / b^2 is not integer)

Then, floor(n / b^2 -1) +1 = floor(n / b^2) -1 +1 = floor(n / b^2)

Which matches the earlier simplification.

So, it seems that the code is correctly computing floor(n / b^2) for each b >=2, and adding it to ans, which is initialized to n (for b=1).

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, for b >=2, the number of a is floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) +1, which simplifies to floor(n / b^2).

But in the code, it's computing floor(g / b) +1, where g = n / b - (b -1), which also simplifies to floor(n / b^2).

Therefore, the code seems correct.

But let's verify with an example.

Take n=10, m=8.

For b=1: ans =10

For b=2: floor(10 /4) =2, so ans +=2

For b=3: floor(10 /9)=1, so ans +=1

For b=4: floor(10 /16)=0, so ans +=0

For b=5: floor(10 /25)=0, so ans +=0

For b=6: floor(10 /36)=0, so ans +=0

For b=7: floor(10 /49)=0, so ans +=0

For b=8: floor(10 /64)=0, so ans +=0

Total ans =10 +2 +1 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0 =13

But according to the note, for n=10, m=8, the valid pairs are 14.

Wait, that's off by one.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, in the note, the valid pairs are:

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

That's 14 pairs.

But according to my calculation, ans =13.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in my calculation.

Wait, for b=1: ans=10

For b=2: floor(10 /4)=2, so ans +=2 → ans=12

For b=3: floor(10 /9)=1, so ans +=1 → ans=13

For b=4: floor(10 /16)=0, so ans +=0 → ans=13

...

Total ans=13, but the note says 14.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the valid pairs.

Looking back at the note:

(1,1),(2,1),(2
