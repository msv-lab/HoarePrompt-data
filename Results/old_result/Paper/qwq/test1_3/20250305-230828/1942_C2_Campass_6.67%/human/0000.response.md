Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have a regular polygon with n sides, and vertices numbered from 1 to n clockwise. Bessie has already chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y additional vertices. We need to choose these vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals that form triangles. The goal is to maximize the number of such triangular pieces.

First, I need to understand what it means to form triangles with non-intersecting diagonals. In a polygon, diagonals are lines connecting non-adjacent vertices, and if they don't intersect, they divide the polygon into regions. We want as many of these regions as possible to be triangles.

Given that the polygon is regular, it's symmetric, which might help in choosing vertices optimally.

Bessie has already chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y more. So, the total number of vertices we can use is x + y.

But wait, the problem says "no more than y other vertices," meaning I can choose from 0 to y additional vertices.

The constraints are:

- 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (number of test cases)

- 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9

- 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2*10^5)

- 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x

And the sum of x over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

Given that n can be up to 10^9, but x is up to 2*10^5, and the total sum of x over all test cases is also up to 2*10^5, I need to find an efficient way to compute the answer for each test case.

Let's consider a smaller example to understand the problem.

Take n=4 (a square), x=2, y=2.

Suppose Bessie chooses vertices 1 and 3.

I can choose vertices 2 and 4.

Then, I can draw diagonals between 1-3 and 2-4, forming two triangles: 1-2-3 and 2-3-4.

But wait, in this case, the whole square is divided into two triangles.

But according to the sample input, for n=4, x=2, y=2, with vertices 1 and 3 chosen, the output is 2, which matches this.

Another sample: n=7, x=3, y=1, with vertices 6,4,3.

I need to choose up to 1 additional vertex to maximize the number of triangles.

I need to think about how adding one more vertex can increase the number of triangles.

Similarly, for n=8, x=4, y=2, with vertices 1,6,2,5.

I need to choose up to 2 additional vertices to maximize triangles.

Looking at the sample output, it's 6,5,2 for the three cases.

I need to find a general approach that can handle large n efficiently, since n can be up to 10^9.

First, since the polygon is regular and vertices are numbered clockwise, the positions are fixed.

Given that we can choose x + y vertices, and draw non-intersecting diagonals to form as many triangles as possible.

I recall that in a polygon with k sides, the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals is k - 2.

Wait, but that's for a convex polygon triangulation.

In general, for a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles formed by triangulation is k - 2.

But here, the polygon is regular, which is convex, so this should apply.

So, if I have a set of vertices, and I triangulate them by drawing non-intersecting diagonals, the number of triangles should be equal to the number of vertices in that set minus 2.

But, the problem allows for choosing up to y additional vertices, in addition to the x chosen by Bessie, to maximize the number of triangles.

Wait, but the output is the maximum number of triangular pieces, which seems to be the total number of triangles formed.

But in the sample input, for n=4, x=2, y=2, output is 2.

In this case, choosing 2 additional vertices (total 4 vertices), which is the entire polygon, and triangulating it should give 4 - 2 = 2 triangles, which matches the sample.

Similarly, for n=7, x=3, y=1, output is 5.

If I choose 1 additional vertex, making it 4 vertices in total, triangulating them should give 4 - 2 = 2 triangles, but the output is 5, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe it's not just triangulating the selected vertices, but triangulating the entire polygon using the selected vertices for diagonals.

Wait, the problem says: "the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices."

So, we can only draw diagonals between the chosen vertices, and these diagonals should not intersect, and we count the number of triangular regions formed.

So, it's not just triangulating the selected vertices, but using them to cut the entire polygon into regions, and counting how many of those regions are triangles.

This seems more involved.

I need to think differently.

I recall that in polygon triangulations, the number of triangles is related to the number of ears in the polygon, but that might not directly apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of dividing the polygon into triangles by choosing certain diagonals, and count how many triangles are formed.

But the challenge is to maximize the number of triangles by choosing up to y additional vertices.

Given that n can be up to 10^9, but x is up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4, I need an efficient algorithm.

First, I need to consider the circular arrangement of the vertices, since it's a polygon.

Bessie has chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y more.

I need to select a total of up to x + y vertices, and draw non-intersecting diagonals between them to maximize the number of triangles.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of triangles formed by these chosen vertices.

I think that the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of connected components formed by the chosen vertices, minus 1.

Wait, in polygon triangulations, the number of triangles is related to the number of vertices and the number of diagonals.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of dividing the polygon into regions using non-intersecting diagonals, and count how many of those regions are triangles.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the dual graph of the triangulation, where each triangle is a node, and edges connect triangles that share a diagonal.

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

I recall that in a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles formed by triangulation is k - 2.

But in this problem, I can choose which vertices to use for drawing diagonals, and I need to maximize the number of triangles.

Perhaps the key is to maximize the number of chosen vertices, since more chosen vertices lead to more triangles.

Wait, but there's a limit on the number of additional vertices I can choose (y).

So, I should choose as many vertices as possible, up to x + y, to maximize the number of triangles.

But, I need to ensure that the diagonals drawn do not intersect.

Given that the polygon is convex, non-intersecting diagonals can be drawn independently in different parts.

Maybe I can think in terms of the arrangement of the chosen vertices around the polygon.

Let me consider sorting the chosen vertices in clockwise order.

Suppose I have the chosen vertices in sorted order: v1, v2, ..., vk, where k <= x + y.

Since the polygon is circular, I can think of the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.

Let me define the gaps as gi = vi+1 - vi - 1, where vi+1 is the next chosen vertex in clockwise order, and v1 follows vk.

Wait, more precisely, since the polygon is circular, the last vertex vn connects back to v1.

So, gi = (vi+1 - vi - 1) mod n, for i from 1 to k-1, and gk = (v1 - vk - 1 + n) mod n.

These gaps represent the number of vertices between chosen vertices.

I need to consider how these gaps affect the number of triangles that can be formed.

I think that for each gap gi, I can draw diagonals that divide that gap into triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to triangulate each of these gaps separately.

Wait, maybe I should think of each gap as a chain of vertices that are not chosen, and see how many triangles can be formed by drawing diagonals from the chosen vertices to these unchosen vertices.

But the problem states that the endpoints of the diagonals must be chosen vertices, so I cannot draw diagonals from unchosen vertices.

Therefore, the diagonals can only be between chosen vertices, and they must not intersect.

So, I need to draw non-intersecting diagonals between chosen vertices.

Given that, the polygon is divided into regions, some of which are triangles.

I need to maximize the number of such triangular regions.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between chosen vertices.

I recall that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles formed by a triangulation is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2, but only if all chosen vertices are connected in one connected component.

But in this problem, I can have multiple connected components, and I need to consider that.

Wait, in a convex polygon, any set of non-intersecting diagonals will divide the polygon into regions, each of which is a polygon with three or more sides.

The number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of connected components formed by the chosen vertices minus 1.

Wait, more precisely, in a planar graph, the number of faces (regions) is equal to the number of chosen vertices (nodes) minus the number of edges (diagonals) plus the number of connected components.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that each triangle is formed by three chosen vertices that are connected by diagonals, and no other chosen vertices are inside the triangle.

But in a convex polygon, all triangles formed by three chosen vertices are valid, as long as their diagonals do not intersect.

Wait, but the problem allows for non-triangular regions as well, but only triangles are counted.

I need to maximize the number of triangles by choosing up to y additional vertices.

I need to find an efficient way to compute this.

Given the constraints, especially with n up to 10^9 and t up to 10^4, I need an O(x log x) per test case solution or better.

Let me consider that the vertices are on a circle, and Bessie has chosen x of them.

I can sort the chosen vertices in clockwise order.

Then, I can look at the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.

Let me denote the gaps as g1, g2, ..., gx, where gi = (vi+1 - vi - 1) mod n, with vx+1 = v1.

Each gap gi represents the number of vertices between vi and vi+1.

I need to choose up to y additional vertices from these gaps.

The idea is to distribute the y additional vertices into these gaps to maximize the number of triangles.

But I need to understand how adding vertices in a gap affects the number of triangles.

Suppose I have a gap of size c (i.e., c vertices between two chosen vertices).

If I don't add any vertices in this gap, then this gap contributes 1 region, which may or may not be a triangle.

If I add one vertex in the gap, then I can draw diagonals from this new vertex to the two endpoints, dividing the gap into two triangles.

If I add two vertices, I can draw diagonals to form more triangles.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Suppose I have two chosen vertices A and B, with c vertices between them.

If I don't add any vertices in this gap, then this part of the polygon is not divided further, and it contributes one region, which is a polygon with c+2 sides (including A and B).

If I add one vertex C in this gap, and draw diagonals from C to A and C to B, then this region is divided into two triangles: A-C-B and the rest.

Wait, actually, in a convex polygon, adding one vertex in the gap divides the region into two triangles.

Wait, no, it divides the region into two polygons: one triangle and one polygon with c+1 sides.

Wait, let's consider:

- Original gap: A and B with c vertices between them.

- Add one vertex C in the gap.

- Draw diagonals A-C and C-B.

- Now, the region between A and B is divided into two parts: triangle A-C-B and the remaining polygon with vertices C and the c-1 vertices between A and C, and the c-1 vertices between C and B.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence of vertices: A, then c vertices, then B.

If I add k vertices in this gap, I can draw diagonals from these k vertices to A and B, dividing the gap into k+1 regions.

Each of these regions is a quadrilateral, which can be further divided into two triangles.

Wait, no, a quadrilateral can be divided into two triangles.

But in this case, if I add k vertices between A and B, and connect them all to A and B, I get k+1 quadrilaterals: A, vertex1, B, vertex2; vertex1, vertex2, B, vertex3; and so on.

Each quadrilateral can be divided into two triangles, but I need to count only the triangular regions formed by the diagonals.

This is getting confusing.

Maybe I need to look for a formula that relates the number of triangles to the number of chosen vertices and the number of gaps.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the total number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices plus the number of additional vertices placed in the gaps, minus the number of gaps minus 1.

But I need to verify this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where chosen vertices are nodes, and gaps are edges between nodes.

Then, the number of triangles could be related to the number of cycles in this graph.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider a different approach.

I recall that in a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles in any triangulation is k - 2.

But in this problem, the chosen vertices are a subset of the polygon's vertices, and I need to draw non-intersecting diagonals between them.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of "regions" formed.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of chosen vertices minus the number of connected components minus 1.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that the chosen vertices divide the polygon into several connected components, each of which can be triangulated independently.

Then, the total number of triangles would be the sum over all connected components of (number of vertices in the component - 2).

But in this problem, since the polygon is circular, there is only one connected component.

Wait, no, if I choose vertices that are not all adjacent, I can have multiple connected components.

Wait, in a convex polygon, all chosen vertices are connected via the polygon's boundary, so there is only one connected component.

Wait, but if I choose vertices that are not all connected via diagonals, they might form multiple connected components.

But in a convex polygon, any two chosen vertices can be connected by a diagonal, as long as they are not adjacent.

Wait, no, in a convex polygon, any two non-adjacent vertices can be connected by a diagonal.

So, if I choose vertices such that no three are colinear, any set of chosen vertices can be connected via non-intersecting diagonals.

Wait, but the problem allows for non-triangular regions as well, so I need to maximize the number of triangles.

I need to find a way to draw non-intersecting diagonals to maximize the number of triangles.

I think the key is to maximize the number of chosen vertices, up to x + y, and then compute the number of triangles based on how these vertices are connected.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of triangles is achieved by choosing as many vertices as possible, up to x + y, and then triangulating them in a way that maximizes the number of triangles.

But in a convex polygon, any triangulation of k vertices will result in k - 2 triangles.

So, if I choose k vertices, the number of triangles is k - 2.

Therefore, to maximize the number of triangles, I should maximize k, which is x + y.

Therefore, the maximum number of triangles is (x + y) - 2.

But, I need to ensure that k <= n, because I can't choose more vertices than exist.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=4, x=2, y=2, output is 2.

According to this formula, (2 + 2) - 2 = 2, which matches.

For n=7, x=3, y=1, output is 5.

According to the formula, (3 + 1) - 2 = 2, which does not match the sample output of 5.

So, my formula is incorrect.

Clearly, there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me think again.

Perhaps the number of triangles is not just (k - 2), where k is the number of chosen vertices.

Maybe I need to consider how the chosen vertices divide the polygon into regions.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the number of triangles formed by the diagonals drawn between chosen vertices.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of ears in the polygon.

In polygon triangulation, the number of ears is equal to the number of convex vertices, which is at least 3 for a convex polygon.

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix the set of chosen vertices.

Then, I can draw non-intersecting diagonals between them to maximize the number of triangles.

In a convex polygon, the number of triangles formed by a triangulation is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of boundary edges plus something.

Wait, perhaps I need to use Euler's formula for planar graphs.

Euler's formula states that for a planar graph, V - E + F = 2, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (regions).

In this problem, the chosen vertices are V, and the edges are the sides of the polygon and the diagonals drawn.

The number of boundary edges is n, since it's a polygon with n sides.

But wait, no, the boundary edges are only between chosen vertices.

Wait, I need to be careful.

The polygon has n vertices and n edges.

We choose k vertices, and draw non-intersecting diagonals between them.

The number of edges in the graph is the number of boundary edges between chosen vertices plus the number of diagonals drawn.

The number of boundary edges between chosen vertices is equal to the number of chosen vertices, because it's a cyclic graph.

So, E = k + number of diagonals.

The number of faces F is equal to the number of triangles plus the number of non-triangular regions.

But I'm only interested in the number of triangles.

This seems too vague again.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles in any triangulation is k - 2.

But in this problem, I can have non-triangular regions, so the number of triangles can be less than k - 2.

But I need to maximize the number of triangles by choosing up to y additional vertices.

Perhaps I need to maximize the number of chosen vertices, up to x + y, and then triangulate them to get k - 2 triangles.

But in the second sample input, that would give (3 + 1) - 2 = 2, but the output is 5, which doesn't match.

So, clearly, my assumption is wrong.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that the chosen vertices divide the polygon into several parts, and in each part, I can triangulate independently.

Wait, but in a convex polygon, all chosen vertices are connected via the polygon's boundary.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of triangles per gap.

Let me consider the gaps between chosen vertices.

Suppose I have x chosen vertices, and I sort them in clockwise order.

Let me compute the gaps gi between consecutive chosen vertices.

gi = (vi+1 - vi - 1) mod n

Then, for each gap gi, if I don't add any vertices in that gap, it contributes one region, which may or may not be a triangle.

If I add vertices in the gap, I can divide that gap into smaller regions, some of which are triangles.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of triangles by distributing the y additional vertices into the gaps optimally.

Perhaps I can model this as distributing y indistinguishable items into x distinguishable bins, where each bin can hold a certain number of items, and each bin has a certain gain in the number of triangles based on how many items are placed in it.

But I need to know how many triangles each additional vertex in a gap contributes.

Let me consider a gap of size c (i.e., c vertices between two chosen vertices).

If I don't add any vertices in this gap, it contributes one region, which is a polygon with c + 2 sides (including the two chosen vertices).

If I add one vertex in this gap, and connect it to the two chosen vertices, I divide this region into two triangles.

Wait, no.

Wait, adding one vertex in the gap divides the region into two quadrilaterals: one with the two chosen vertices and the new vertex, and the other with the new vertex and the c - 1 remaining vertices in the gap.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have two chosen vertices A and B with c vertices between them, and I add one vertex C in the gap, then I can draw diagonals from C to A and C to B, forming two triangles: A-C-B and the remaining vertices form another region.

Wait, actually, in a convex polygon, adding one vertex in the gap and connecting it to A and B divides the region into two parts: one triangle A-C-B and another polygon with c vertices.

Wait, but in reality, adding one vertex in the gap divides the original region into two parts: one triangle and one polygon with c vertices.

But the polygon with c vertices can be further divided into triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that adding k vertices in a gap of size c allows me to divide the gap into k + 1 regions, each of which can be triangulated separately.

But this seems too involved.

Let me consider a different approach.

I recall that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles in any triangulation is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2.

But in this problem, I can have non-triangular regions, so the number of triangles can be less than that.

But I need to maximize the number of triangles by choosing up to y additional vertices.

Perhaps I need to choose y additional vertices in such a way that maximizes the number of triangles formed.

Wait, maybe I need to choose vertices in the gaps that allow me to form as many triangles as possible.

Let me consider that for a gap of size c, if I add k vertices in that gap, I can form k + 1 triangles.

Wait, let's see:

- Original gap: two chosen vertices A and B with c vertices between them.

- Adding k vertices in the gap divides the gap into k + 1 smaller gaps.

- Each of these smaller gaps can be triangulated separately.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to find a formula for the number of triangles based on the number of additional vertices placed in each gap.

Suppose I have x chosen vertices and y additional vertices to place in the gaps.

Let me denote that for each gap gi, I place ki additional vertices, where sum of all ki <= y.

Then, the number of triangles contributed by each gap gi is some function of ki and gi.

I need to find what that function is.

Wait, perhaps for each gap gi, the number of triangles added is floor(ki / 2), or something like that.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider a small example.

Take n=4, x=2, y=2.

Bessie chooses vertices 1 and 3.

There are two gaps: gap1 between 1 and 3 with one vertex (2), and gap2 between 3 and 1 with one vertex (4).

If I don't add any vertices, I have two regions, each a triangle (1-2-3 and 3-4-1), but in this case, the diagonals are only between chosen vertices, which are 1 and 3.

Wait, in this case, if I don't add any vertices, I have the original polygon divided into two triangles by the diagonal between 1 and 3.

So, without adding any vertices, I have two triangles.

If I add one vertex in one of the gaps, say add vertex 2, then I can draw diagonals from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 3, forming two triangles: 1-2-3 and 1-2-4.

Wait, no, in this case, adding vertex 2 and connecting it to 1 and 3 divides the polygon into three triangles: 1-2-3, 2-3-4, and 1-2-4.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=4, x=2, y=2, output is 2, which matches the case where no additional vertices are added.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Wait, the sample input is:

3

8 4 2

1 6 2 5

7 3 1

6 4 3

4 2 2

1 3

And the output is:

6

5

2

So, for n=4, x=2, y=2, output is 2.

In my earlier consideration, without adding any vertices, I have two triangles, which matches the output.

If I add one vertex, say vertex 2, and connect it to 1 and 3, I get three triangles: 1-2-3, 2-3-4, and 1-2-4.

But according to the sample, the output is 2, which suggests that I can only have two triangular regions.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

If I add vertex 2 and connect it to 1 and 3, then the regions are:

- Triangle 1-2-3

- Quadrilateral 2-3-4-1

Wait, in this case, the quadrilateral 2-3-4-1 is not a triangle.

So, only one triangle is added, and the quadrilateral is not a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is still two: the original two triangles before adding any vertices.

Wait, but in reality, when I add vertex 2 and connect it to 1 and 3, I divide the quadrilateral 1-2-3-4 into two triangles: 1-2-3 and 2-3-4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire polygon is divided into triangles.

In this case, adding vertex 2 and connecting it to 1 and 3 divides the polygon into two triangles: 1-2-3 and 2-3-4.

So, the number of triangles is two, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, if I add vertex 4 and connect it to 1 and 3, I would have two triangles: 1-4-3 and 1-2-4.

Again, two triangles.

So, in this case, adding vertices doesn't increase the number of triangles beyond two.

Therefore, the maximum number of triangles is two, which matches the sample output.

So, perhaps my initial assumption is correct: the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2, but only if the chosen vertices form a single connected component.

In this case, with k=2+2=4 chosen vertices, the number of triangles would be 4 - 2 = 2, which matches the sample.

Similarly, in the second sample input: n=7, x=3, y=1, output is 5.

If k=3+1=4, then k - 2 = 2, but the output is 5, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps there's another factor at play.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the chosen vertices divide the polygon into regions, and each region can be triangulated separately.

In that case, the total number of triangles would be the sum over all regions of (number of vertices in the region - 2).

In the first sample input, with k=4, the polygon is divided into two triangles, so total triangles is 2.

In the second sample input, with k=4, perhaps the polygon is divided into five triangles.

Wait, but according to the sample, output is 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that adding vertices in certain gaps can increase the number of triangles beyond k - 2.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each gap, adding vertices in that gap allows me to form more triangles.

Specifically, for a gap of size c (i.e., c vertices between two chosen vertices), if I add k vertices in that gap, I can form k + 1 triangles in that gap.

Wait, let's see.

Suppose I have a gap of size c, meaning c vertices between two chosen vertices A and B.

If I add k vertices in that gap, I can connect each of these k vertices to A and B, forming k triangles: A-C1-B, A-C2-B, ..., A-Ck-B.

Additionally, the remaining part of the gap, which now has c - k vertices, forms another region.

But in this case, the number of triangles formed in this gap is equal to k, and the remaining region has c - k + 2 vertices (including A and B).

But this remaining region can be further divided into triangles.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles in this gap is equal to k + (c - k - 1), assuming c - k >= 1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles in any triangulation is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2.

But in this problem, since I can have non-triangular regions, the number of triangles can be less than that.

But I need to maximize the number of triangles by choosing up to y additional vertices.

Perhaps I need to maximize the number of chosen vertices, up to x + y, and then compute the number of triangles as k - 2, where k is the number of chosen vertices.

But as seen in the second sample input, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the polygon is divided into regions, each of which can be triangulated independently.

Then, the total number of triangles would be the sum over all regions of (number of vertices in the region - 2).

In that case, I need to maximize this sum by choosing up to y additional vertices to place in the gaps.

But I need to find an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that the sum over all regions of (number of vertices in the region - 2) is equal to the total number of chosen vertices - number of regions - 1.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the fact that the sum of (v - 2) over all regions is equal to k - 2, where k is the number of chosen vertices.

Wait, in a triangulation of a polygon, the sum of (v - 3) over all faces is equal to k - 2 - e, where e is the number of edges on the boundary.

But this is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think in terms of dynamic programming.

Suppose I have the gaps between chosen vertices, and I need to distribute y additional vertices into these gaps to maximize the number of triangles.

Let me denote that for each gap gi, if I place ki additional vertices in it, I can compute the number of triangles contributed by that gap.

Then, the total number of triangles would be the sum over all gaps of triangles contributed by each gap.

I need to maximize this sum subject to the constraint that the sum of ki <= y.

But I need to know how many triangles each gap contributes based on ki.

Let me consider that for a gap of size c, placing k vertices in it allows me to form k triangles.

Wait, in reality, placing k vertices in a gap of size c divides the gap into k + 1 smaller gaps, each of which can be triangulated separately.

But this seems too involved.

Let me consider that for a gap of size c, placing k vertices in it allows me to form k triangles, and the remaining part of the gap is a polygon with c - k + 2 vertices, which can be triangulated into (c - k) triangles.

Wait, no, a polygon with m vertices can be triangulated into m - 2 triangles.

So, if I place k vertices in a gap of size c, I divide the gap into k + 1 smaller gaps, each of which can be triangulated.

But this seems too time-consuming.

Let me consider that for a gap of size c, placing k vertices allows me to form k + (c - k - 1) = c - 1 triangles.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps for a gap of size c, placing k vertices allows me to form k + (c - k - 1) = c - 1 triangles.

But that doesn't make sense, because if c = 1 and k = 0, then c - 1 = 0 triangles, but in reality, without adding any vertices in a gap of size 1, I have one triangle.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a gap of size c, placing k vertices allows me to form k + 1 triangles.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps for a gap of size c, placing k vertices divides the gap into k + 1 smaller gaps, each of which can be triangulated.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the total number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of regions minus 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the formula for planar graphs again.

In a planar graph, V - E + F = 2, where F is the number of faces (regions).

In this problem, V is the number of chosen vertices, E is the number of diagonals drawn plus the number of boundary edges between chosen vertices.

The number of boundary edges is equal to the number of chosen vertices, since it's a cyclic graph.

So, E = number of chosen vertices + number of diagonals.

The number of faces F is equal to the number of triangular regions plus the number of non-triangular regions.

But I'm still not getting anywhere.

Let me consider that in a convex polygon, any set of non-intersecting diagonals divides the polygon into regions, each of which is a polygon with at least three sides.

The total number of triangles among these regions is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of regions minus 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of regions formed by the diagonals.

In general, for a convex polygon with k vertices and non-intersecting diagonals, the number of regions is equal to the number of triangles plus the number of non-triangular regions.

But I need to maximize the number of triangles.

I'm going in circles.

Let me try to look for a different perspective.

Suppose I fix the set of chosen vertices and draw non-intersecting diagonals to maximize the number of triangles.

In that case, the number of triangles would be equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of boundary edges plus something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles in any triangulation is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2.

But in this problem, since I can have non-triangular regions, the number of triangles can be less than that.

But I need to maximize the number of triangles by choosing up to y additional vertices.

Perhaps I need to choose y additional vertices in such a way that maximizes the number of triangles.

Wait, maybe I need to prioritize placing additional vertices in the largest gaps to divide them into smaller gaps, thereby increasing the number of triangles.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that for each gap gi, if I place ki additional vertices in it, the number of triangles contributed by that gap is ki + min(gi - ki, 1).

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of triangles per gap is equal to ki + floor((gi - ki)/2).

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider a gap of size c.

If c = 0, meaning two chosen vertices are adjacent, then placing no additional vertices, I have one triangle.

If c = 1, placing no additional vertices, I have one triangle.

If c = 2, placing no additional vertices, I have one quadrilateral, which can be divided into two triangles.

Wait, in this case, if I don't place any additional vertices, I have one quadrilateral, which can be divided into two triangles.

So, for c = 2, without adding any vertices, I have two triangles.

If I place one additional vertex in the gap, I can divide the gap into two triangles.

So, in this case, placing one vertex gives two triangles, same as not placing any vertices.

Wait, but in reality, placing one vertex in a gap of size 2 divides the gap into two triangles.

So, the number of triangles is two, same as without adding any vertices.

Wait, but in a gap of size 2, without adding any vertices, I can already have two triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for a gap of size c, the number of triangles is floor((c + 2)/2).

Wait, no.

Wait, for c = 0: floor((0 + 2)/2) = 1

c = 1: floor((1 + 2)/2) = 1

c = 2: floor((2 + 2)/2) = 2

Which matches my earlier observation.

So, perhaps for each gap gi, the number of triangles is floor((gi + 2)/2).

Then, the total number of triangles would be the sum over all gaps of floor((gi + 2)/2).

But in the first sample input, with n=8, x=4, y=2, and chosen vertices 1,6,2,5.

Let's sort the chosen vertices in clockwise order: 1,2,5,6.

The gaps are:

- between 1 and 2: g1 = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0

- between 2 and 5: g2 = 5 - 2 - 1 = 2

- between 5 and 6: g3 = 6 - 5 - 1 = 0

- between 6 and 1: g4 = (1 + 8 - 6) - 1 = 2

Then, sum of floor((gi + 2)/2) for i=1 to 4:

floor((0 + 2)/2) = 1

floor((2 + 2)/2) = 2

floor((0 + 2)/2) = 1

floor((2 + 2)/2) = 2

Total: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6, which matches the first sample output.

In the second sample input, n=7, x=3, y=1, chosen vertices 6,4,3.

Sort them in clockwise order: 3,4,6.

The gaps are:

- between 3 and 4: g1 = 4 - 3 - 1 = 0

- between 4 and 6: g2 = 6 - 4 - 1 = 1

- between 6 and 3: g3 = (3 + 7 - 6) - 1 = 3

Then, sum of floor((gi + 2)/2):

floor((0 + 2)/2) = 1

floor((1 + 2)/2) = 1

floor((3 + 2)/2) = 2

Total: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, but the sample output is 5, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me consider that for a gap of size c, the number of triangles is c // 2 + 1.

For c=0: 0//2 + 1 = 1

c=1: 1//2 + 1 = 1

c=2: 2//2 + 1 = 2

c=3: 3//2 + 1 = 2

Which for the second sample input:

g1=0: 1

g2=1:1

g3=3:2

Total: 1+1+2=4, still not matching the sample output of 5.

So, perhaps this isn't the right formula.

Wait, maybe for c >=1, the number of triangles is floor((c + 1)/2).

For c=0: 0

c=1:1

c=2:1

c=3:2

But in the first sample input, for c=0, we have one triangle, so this doesn't match.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each gap, the number of triangles is equal to the number of additional vertices placed in that gap plus one.

So, for a gap gi, if I place ki additional vertices, then the number of triangles is ki + 1.

Then, the total number of triangles is sum over all gaps of (ki + 1).

But I need to ensure that the sum of ki <= y.

In this case, the total number of triangles is sum(ki) + x = (sum(ki) + x).

But sum(ki) <= y, so the maximum is x + y.

But in the first sample input, x=4, y=2, output=6, which matches x + y.

In the second sample input, x=3, y=1, output=5, which matches x + y.

In the third sample input, x=2, y=2, output=2, which does not match x + y=4.

So, my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, in the third sample input, x=2, y=2, output=2, which is less than x + y=4.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is min(x + y, n - 2).

But in the first sample input, x=4, y=2, n=8, n - 2=6, which matches the output=6.

In the second sample input, x=3, y=1, n=7, n - 2=5, which matches the output=5.

In the third sample input, x=2, y=2, n=4, n - 2=2, which matches the output=2.

So, perhaps the maximum number of triangles is min(x + y, n - 2).

This seems to match all the sample inputs.

Let me verify this.

In the first sample input, min(4 + 2, 8 - 2) = min(6,6) = 6.

Second sample input, min(3 + 1, 7 - 2) = min(4,5) = 4, but the sample output is 5.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps it's not n - 2, but something else.

Wait, perhaps it's min(x + y, n - x + something).

Wait, in the second sample input, min(3 + 1, 7 - 3) = min(4,4) = 4, but the output is 5.

Wait, perhaps it's min(x + y, n - 1).

In the first sample input, min(6,7)=6, which matches.

Second sample input, min(4,6)=4, which doesn't match output=5.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps it's x + y, but limited by some other factor.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus
