Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have participants going on a hike, and we need to calculate the minimum number of tents required. Each tent can hold up to 3 people. There are three types of participants:

1. **Introverts (a):** Each wants to be alone in a tent. So, each introvert requires exactly one tent.

2. **Extroverts (b):** Each wants to be in a tent with exactly two others. So, each extrovert must be in a tent with two other people.

3. **Universals (c):** They are flexible and can be alone, with one other, or with two others.

Our task is to fulfill everyone's preferences and find the minimum number of tents needed. If it's impossible, we should return -1.

First, let's think about the constraints and what needs to be satisfied.

- Each introvert needs their own tent. So, we need at least 'a' tents for them.

- Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. So, for each extrovert, there must be two other people (which can be universals or other extroverts) in the same tent.

- Universals are flexible, so they can fill in the remaining spots in tents.

I need to minimize the number of tents, so I should try to maximize the number of people in each tent, whenever possible.

Let me consider the extroverts first since they have the strictest requirement. Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. So, for every extrovert, there must be two other people to accompany them in the tent.

Let's see, if I have 'b' extroverts, then I need to have at least 2*b additional people to accompany them in the tents. These additional people can be universals or other extroverts.

Wait, but extroverts also need to be in a tent with two others, so if I have extroverts sharing a tent, that might work.

Let me think about how to group the extroverts.

If I have three extroverts, they can share one tent, satisfying each other's requirement of being with two others.

Similarly, if I have a multiple of three extroverts, I can group them into tents of three, each satisfying their preference.

If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of three, then I'll need to use universals to fill in the remaining spots.

For example, if I have 4 extroverts, I can have one tent with three extroverts and another tent with one extrovert and two universals.

Wait, but extroverts need to be with two others, so in the second tent, the extrovert would be with two universals.

So, in general, for 'b' extroverts, I need to group them into tents of three, and if there are remaining extroverts, I need to pair them with universals.

Specifically:

- If b is a multiple of 3, then I need b/3 tents for the extroverts.

- If b % 3 == 1, then I need (b//3) + 1 tents, but I need to ensure that there are enough universals to fill the extra spots.

- If b % 3 == 2, then I need (b//3) + 1 tents, again ensuring enough universals.

But I need to make sure that the universals are available to fill these spots.

Also, introverts need their own tents, as they must be alone.

So, the total number of tents would be the number of tents for introverts plus the number of tents for extroverts, considering the grouping.

But wait, universals can also be placed in tents with other people or alone.

To minimize the number of tents, I should try to fill the tents as much as possible, preferably with three people.

So, perhaps I should first allocate tents for introverts, then group extroverts in tents of three, and use universals to fill any remaining spots.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote:

- Tents for introverts: a tents, each with one introvert.

- Tents for extroverts: we need to group extroverts in tents of three.

- If b is divisible by 3, then we need b/3 tents for extroverts.

- If b % 3 == 1, then we need (b//3) + 1 tents, but one of these tents will have only one extrovert, which is not allowed, unless we can add two universals to that tent.

- Similarly, if b % 3 == 2, we need (b//3) + 1 tents, and the last tent will have two extroverts, which is not sufficient for extroverts' preference, unless we add one universal to make it three.

Wait, no. If b % 3 == 2, then in the last tent, we have two extroverts, and we need to add one universal to make it three.

If b % 3 == 1, then in the last tent, we have one extrovert, and we need to add two universals to make it three.

So, in both cases, we need additional universals to fill the tents.

Specifically:

- If b % 3 == 0: need b/3 tents for extroverts.

- If b % 3 == 1: need (b//3) + 1 tents, and need at least 2 universals for the last tent.

- If b % 3 == 2: need (b//3) + 1 tents, and need at least 1 universal for the last tent.

So, the total number of universals needed to satisfy the extroverts' requirements is:

- If b % 3 == 0: 0 universals.

- If b % 3 == 1: 2 universals.

- If b % 3 == 2: 1 universal.

After satisfying the extroverts, we can use the remaining universals to fill other tents, either sharing with other universals or being alone.

Now, after allocating tents for introverts and extroverts, we need to see how to allocate the remaining universals.

To minimize the number of tents, we should try to put as many universals as possible in each tent, up to three per tent.

So, the remaining universals after satisfying extroverts can be grouped into tents of three.

Therefore, the total number of tents would be:

- Tents for introverts: a

- Tents for extroverts: ceil(b/3)

- Tents for remaining universals: ceil((c - required Universals)/3)

But we need to make sure that the required universals for extroverts do not exceed the available universals.

So, the required universals are:

- If b % 3 == 0: 0

- If b % 3 == 1: 2

- If b % 3 == 2: 1

If c < required universals, then it's impossible, return -1.

Otherwise, the total number of tents is a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required universals)/3)

Now, let's see how to compute ceil(b/3).

In integer division, ceil(b/3) is equal to (b + 2) // 3

Similarly, ceil((c - required)/3) is (c - required + 2) // 3

So, the total number of tents would be:

a + (b + 2) // 3 + (c - required + 2) // 3

Where required is:

if b % 3 == 0: 0

elif b % 3 == 1: 2

else: 1

Alternatively, we can compute required as (b % 3) if b % 3 < 2 else 2

Wait, no. More precisely:

required = [0,2,1][b % 3]

So, required = [0,2,1][b % 3]

Then, total tents = a + (b + 2) // 3 + (c - required + 2) // 3

But we need to ensure that c >= required, otherwise, it's impossible.

Now, let's see if this makes sense.

Take the first example:

a=1, b=2, c=3

required = [0,2,1][2%3] = [0,2,1][2] = 1

So, required = 1

Check if c >= required: 3 >= 1, yes.

Then, total tents = 1 + (2 + 2)//3 + (3 - 1 + 2)//3 = 1 + 4//3 + 4//3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Which matches the first sample output.

Second test case:

a=1, b=4, c=1

required = [0,2,1][4%3] = [0,2,1][1] = 2

Check if c >= required: 1 < 2, impossible, output -1

Which matches the second sample output.

Third test case:

a=1, b=4, c=2

required = 2

c >= required: 2 >= 2, yes.

Total tents = 1 + (4 + 2)//3 + (2 - 2 + 2)//3 = 1 + 6//3 + 2//3 = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3

Matches the third sample output.

Fourth test case:

a=1, b=1, c=1

required = [0,2,1][1%3] = [0,2,1][1] = 2

c >= required: 1 < 2, impossible, output -1

Matches the fourth sample output.

Fifth test case:

a=1, b=3, c=2

required = [0,2,1][3%3] = [0,2,1][0] = 0

Total tents = 1 + (3 + 2)//3 + (2 - 0 + 2)//3 = 1 + 5//3 + 4//3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Matches the fifth sample output.

Sixth test case:

a=19, b=7, c=18

required = [0,2,1][7%3] = [0,2,1][1] = 2

c >= required: 18 >= 2, yes.

Total tents = 19 + (7 + 2)//3 + (18 - 2 + 2)//3 = 19 + 9//3 + 18//3 = 19 + 3 + 6 = 28

Matches the sixth sample output.

Seventh test case:

a=0, b=0, c=0

required = [0,2,1][0%3] = 0

Total tents = 0 + (0 + 2)//3 + (0 - 0 + 2)//3 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Matches the seventh sample output.

Eighth test case:

a=7, b=0, c=0

required = [0,2,1][0%3] = 0

Total tents = 7 + (0 + 2)//3 + (0 - 0 + 2)//3 = 7 + 0 + 0 = 7

Matches the eighth sample output.

Ninth test case:

a=0, b=24, c=0

required = [0,2,1][24%3] = [0,2,1][0] = 0

Total tents = 0 + (24 + 2)//3 + (0 - 0 + 2)//3 = 0 + 8 + 0 = 8

Matches the ninth sample output.

Tenth test case:

a=1000000000, b=1000000000, c=1000000000

required = [0,2,1][1000000000%3] = [0,2,1][1] = 2

c >= required: 1000000000 >= 2, yes.

Total tents = 1000000000 + (1000000000 + 2)//3 + (1000000000 - 2 + 2)//3 = 1000000000 + 333333334 + 333333334 = 1666666668

But the sample output is 1666666667. Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, let's compute it again.

a = 1000000000

b = 1000000000

c = 1000000000

required = [0,2,1][1000000000 % 3] = [0,2,1][1] = 2

c - required = 1000000000 - 2 = 999999998

Then, (c - required + 2)//3 = (999999998 + 2)//3 = 1000000000//3 = 333333333.333..., but integer division gives 333333333

So, total tents = 1000000000 (a) + (1000000000 + 2)//3 = 1000000000 + 333333334 = 1333333334

Wait, but according to my earlier formula, I have:

total tents = a + (b + 2)//3 + (c - required + 2)//3

But in this calculation, I only see a + (b + 2)//3 + (c - required + 2)//3

Wait, but in this test case, b is 1000000000, which is divisible by 3 since 1000000000 % 3 = 1, but according to the required, it's 2, but actually, 1000000000 % 3 = 1, so required = 2

Then, (c - required + 2)//3 = (1000000000 - 2 + 2)//3 = 1000000000//3 = 333333333

So, total tents = 1000000000 + (1000000000 + 2)//3 + (1000000000 - 2 + 2)//3 = 1000000000 + 333333334 + 333333333 = 1666666667

Yes, that matches the sample output.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, the formula seems correct.

Now, let's see how the given program implements this logic.

The program is:

def func():

for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

(a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())

b += c

print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])

Wait, this looks different from what I derived.

Let me try to understand this.

First, it reads the input values a, b, c.

Then, it adds c to b: b += c

So, now b is b + c.

Then, it prints either a - - b // 3 or -1, depending on whether c < b % 3.

Wait, a - - b // 3 is the same as a + b // 3, because minus minus is plus.

But in Python, - - is equivalent to +.

So, it's printing a + (b // 3) if c >= b % 3, else -1.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I had a + (b + 2) // 3 + (c - required + 2) // 3

But this program is doing a + (b + c) // 3, or something similar.

Wait, no, it's a + ((b + c) // 3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's see.

b += c means b is now b + c.

Then, b // 3 is (b + c) // 3.

But in my earlier formula, I had a + (b + 2) // 3 + (c - required + 2) // 3

But this seems different.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this.

Let me see.

If I consider that extroverts need to be in tents of three, including themselves and two others, who can be universals or other extroverts.

Then, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

Similarly, the number of tents needed for introverts is a.

And the number of tents needed for universals is ceil((c - required) / 3)

But the given program seems to be computing a + floor((b + c) / 3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's see.

In the program, it's a + floor((b + c) / 3), but only if c >= b % 3, else -1.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, required is [0,2,1][b % 3], and c >= required.

Then, total tents are a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil((c - required) / 3)

But perhaps there's a way to simplify this.

Let me see.

Let me consider that ceil(b / 3) = (b + 2) // 3

And ceil((c - required) / 3) = (c - required + 2) // 3

So, total tents = a + (b + 2) // 3 + (c - required + 2) // 3

But in the program, it's a + ((b + c) // 3), which is a + floor((b + c) / 3)

Wait, but that's different from what I have.

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical trick here.

Let me see.

Let me consider that the total number of people is a + b + c.

But introverts need their own tents, so a tents are reserved for them.

Then, the remaining people are b + c, who need to be placed in tents of up to 3 people.

So, the number of tents needed for b + c is ceil((b + c) / 3)

Therefore, total tents would be a + ceil((b + c) / 3)

But in the program, it's a + floor((b + c) / 3), but that's different.

Wait, no, in the program, it's a - - (b + c) // 3, which is a + (b + c) // 3

But ceil(x) = floor(x + 2/3)

Wait, more precisely, ceil(x) = floor(x + 3 - 1)/3, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, in integer division, ceil division can be computed as (x + divisor - 1) // divisor

So, ceil((b + c) / 3) = (b + c + 2) // 3

But in the program, it's a + (b + c) // 3, which is a + floor((b + c) / 3)

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be a + ceil((b + c) / 3)

Wait, but in the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Wait, in the first sample:

a=1, b=2, c=3

b + c = 5

floor(5 / 3) = 1

So, a + floor((b + c)/3) = 1 + 1 = 2

But the correct answer is 3.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the program, it's b += c, then print(a - - b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]

Which is a + floor(b / 3), but b is b + c.

Wait, in the first sample:

a=1, b=2, c=3

b += c → b=5

floor(5 / 3) = 1

a + 1 = 2

But the correct answer is 3.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the program, it's a - - b // 3, which is a + floor(b / 3)

In the first sample, a=1, b=2, c=3

b += c → b=5

floor(5 / 3) = 1

a + 1 = 2

But the correct answer is 3.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Wait, no, it's a - - b // 3, which is a + floor(b / 3)

Wait, but in the sample, it should be 3, but according to this, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I need to look again.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach.

Let me consider that the extroverts need to be in tents of three, including themselves and two others.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 3)

Similarly, the number of tents needed for the remaining universals is ceil((c - required) / 3)

But perhaps there's a way to combine this.

Wait, perhaps the program is considering that the extroverts and universals can be grouped together in tents of three, and the introverts need separate tents.

So, the number of tents for extroverts and universals is ceil((b + c) / 3)

And the total tents is a + ceil((b + c) / 3)

But in the first sample, a=1, b=2, c=3

ceil((2 + 3)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

Total tents = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches.

Wait, but in the program, it's a + floor(b / 3), which is a + floor(5/3) = 1 + 1 = 2

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's a + floor(b / 3) + 1 if (b + c) % 3 != 0 else a + floor(b / 3)

But in the program, it's a + floor(b / 3), which is 2, but the correct answer is 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the program.

Wait, let's look again.

The program is:

def func():

for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

(a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())

b += c

print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])

So, a - - b // 3 is a + floor(b / 3)

But in the first sample, a=1, b=2, c=3

b += c → b=5

floor(5 / 3) = 1

a + 1 = 2

But the correct answer is 3.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the program is computing a + ceil(b / 3), but in Python, ceil(b / 3) is - - b // 3, which is a + floor(b / 3)

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's a + ceil(b / 3), and ceil(b / 3) is (b + 2) // 3

But in the program, it's a + floor(b / 3), which is a + floor(b / 3)

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, maybe the program is considering that after allocating tents for introverts, the remaining people are b + c, and they need to be placed in tents of up to 3 people.

So, the number of additional tents needed is ceil((b + c) / 3)

But in Python, ceil(x) is equivalent to (x + 2) // 3 for integer x.

But in the program, it's a + floor(b / 3), which is a + floor((b + c) / 3)

Wait, but floor((b + c) / 3) is not equal to ceil((b + c) / 3)

Unless (b + c) is divisible by 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.

Let me consider that the total number of tents is a + ceil((b + c) / 3)

But in the program, it's a + floor(b / 3), which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be a - - (b + c) // 3, which would be a + ceil((b + c) / 3)

But in the program, it's a - - b // 3, which is a + floor(b / 3)

Wait, perhaps the intention was to compute a + ceil((b + c) / 3), but it's written incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps in Python, a - - b // 3 is a + floor(b / 3), but it should be a + ceil(b / 3)

Wait, perhaps I need to check the expression again.

In Python, a - - b is a + b, and then floor division by 3.

Wait, perhaps I misread the expression.

Wait, let's look at the program again.

print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])

So, a - -b // 3 is a + floor(b / 3)

But as per my earlier reasoning, it should be a + ceil((b + c) / 3)

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be a - -(b + c) // 3

But in the program, it's a - -b // 3, which is a + floor(b / 3)

This seems inconsistent with the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to compute this.

Wait, maybe the program is considering that the number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3), and the number of tents for universals is ceil(c / 3), and total tents are a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil(c / 3)

But that doesn't seem right, because universals can be used to fulfill the requirements of extroverts.

Wait, perhaps the program is combining b and c and dividing by 3, but I still don't see how a + floor((b + c) / 3) gives the correct answer.

Wait, in the first sample, a=1, b=2, c=3

a + floor((2 + 3)/3) = 1 + 1 = 2, but the correct answer is 3.

So, this seems wrong.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach.

Let me consider that the extroverts need to be in groups of three, including themselves and two others.

So, for every group of three extroverts, they can share one tent.

If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of three, then we need to add universals to make up the required spots.

So, if b % 3 == 1, we need 2 universals per such group.

If b % 3 == 2, we need 1 universal per such group.

Then, the total number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3)

And the total number of universals required is (b % 3 == 1) * 2 + (b % 3 == 2) * 1

Then, the remaining universals are c - required

Then, the number of tents for the remaining universals is ceil((c - required) / 3)

And the total tents are a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil((c - required) / 3)

But in the program, it's a + floor(b / 3), which doesn't seem to match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical trick to combine these.

Wait, perhaps the expression a + ceil((b + c) / 3) gives the correct total tents.

Let me check with the first sample:

a=1, b=2, c=3

ceil((2 + 3)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

Total tents = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches.

Another sample:

a=1, b=4, c=1

ceil((4 + 1)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

Total tents = 1 + 2 = 3, but according to the sample, it's -1.

Wait, but in this case, required = [0,2,1][4%3] = [0,2,1][1] = 2

Since c=1 < 2, it's impossible, so it should be -1.

But in the program, a + floor((b + c)/3) = 1 + floor(5/3) = 1 + 1 = 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the program is using a + ceil((b + c)/3), but in Python, ceil(x) is (x + 2) // 3

So, a + (b + c + 2) // 3

In the first sample:

a=1, b=2, c=3

(2 + 3 + 2) // 3 = 7 // 3 = 2

Total tents = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches.

Second sample:

a=1, b=4, c=1

(4 + 1 + 2) // 3 = 7 // 3 = 2

Total tents = 1 + 2 = 3

But according to the sample, it's -1.

So, the program seems incorrect because it doesn't check if c >= required.

Wait, but in the program, it's print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])

So, it's a + floor(b / 3), but with a condition [c < b % 3]

Wait, but b is b + c, so b % 3 is (b + c) % 3

Wait, no, in the program, b += c, so b is b + c.

Wait, no, in the program, it's b += c, then b // 3, and b % 3.

So, b is b + c.

So, it's checking if c < (b + c) % 3

Wait, but b is now b + c.

Wait, no, b += c means b = b + c.

So, b % 3 is (b + c) % 3

And c < b % 3 is c < (b + c) % 3

Wait, that seems odd.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that required = (b + c) % 3

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in the program, it's [c < b % 3]

But b has been set to b + c earlier.

So, b % 3 is (b + c) % 3

So, it's checking if c < (b + c) % 3

Which seems unclear.

Wait, perhaps the condition is c < required, where required is based on b % 3 before adding c.

Wait, but b is incremented by c before computing b % 3.

This seems confusing.

Perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the number of tents needed is a + ceil((b + c) / 3)

But we have to ensure that c >= (b % 3)

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, required is [0,2,1][b % 3]

But perhaps in the program, it's simplifying it to c >= b % 3

Which might not be accurate.

Wait, in the first sample, b=2, c=3

b % 3 = 2 % 3 = 2

c=3 >= 2, which is true.

In the second sample, b=4, c=1

b % 3 = 4 % 3 = 1

c=1 >=1, which is true, but according to the sample, it's -1.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's c >= (b + c) % 3

In the second sample, b=4, c=1

b + c =5, 5 % 3 =2

c=1 <2, so it's -1, which matches.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, required is [0,2,1][b % 3]

Which for b=4, b % 3=1, required=2

So, c=1 <2, hence -1

Similarly, for b=2, c=3

b % 3=2, required=1

c=3 >=1, which is true.

Wait, but in the program, it's c < b % 3

But b has been set to b + c, so it's c < (b + c) % 3

In the second sample, b=4, c=1

b + c=5, 5 % 3=2

c=1 <2, so -1, which matches.

In the first sample, b=2, c=3

b + c=5, 5 % 3=2

c=3 >=2, which is true, so a + floor(b / 3)=1 + floor(5/3)=1 +1=2

But the correct answer is 3.

Wait, there's still a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the program is computing a + ceil((b + c)/3)

But in Python, ceil(x) is (x + 2) // 3

But in the program, it's a - -b // 3, which is a + floor(b / 3)

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be a - -(b + c) // 3

Wait, but b has already been set to b + c

Wait, perhaps it's a - -b // 3, which is a + floor(b / 3)

But ceil(x) is floor(x + 2)/3

Wait, perhaps in the program, it's a + floor(b / 3) + something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that floor(b / 3) is equal to ceil((b + 2)/3)

Wait, no, floor(b / 3) is floor(b / 3), and ceil(x) is (x + 2) // 3 for integer x.

Wait, perhaps the expression a - -b // 3 is a + ceil(b / 3)

Wait, but in Python, ceil(b / 3) is (b + 2) // 3

But a - -b // 3 is a + floor(b / 3)

Wait, perhaps there's confusion with operator precedence.

Wait, let's look at the expression: a - -b // 3

This is equivalent to a + (floor(b / 3))

Because - -b is the same as +b, and then floor division by 3.

Wait, but in Python, - -b is the same as +b

So, a + floor(b / 3)

But earlier, I thought it should be a + ceil((b + c)/3)

Which is a + floor((b + c) / 3) + k, where k is an adjustment based on the remainder.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to compute this.

Let me consider that ceil((b + c)/3) = floor((b + c + 2)/3)

So, a + ceil((b + c)/3) = a + floor((b + c + 2)/3)

But in the program, it's a + floor(b / 3)

Which is different.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be a - -(b + c) // 3, which would be a + floor((b + c)/3)

But that's still not equal to a + ceil((b + c)/3)

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrectly written.

Let me check with the first sample:

a=1, b=2, c=3

b += c → b=5

floor(5 / 3)=1

a + 1=2

But correct answer is 3.

Wait, perhaps the program is a + floor((b + c + 2)/3)

But in the program, it's a - -b // 3, which is a + floor(b / 3)

Wait, perhaps the expression is intended to be a - -(b + c) // 3, which would be a + floor((b + c)/3)

But in the first sample, a + floor((b + c)/3)=1 + floor(5/3)=1 +1=2, but correct is 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is a + ceil((b + c)/3)

Which in Python is a + (b + c + 2) // 3

In the first sample, a=1, b=2, c=3

(2 + 3 + 2)//3=7//3=2

a + 2=3, which matches.

In the second sample, a=1, b=4, c=1

(4 +1 +2)//3=7//3=2

a + 2=3, but correct is -1

So, the program seems to be missing the condition to check if c >= required

Wait, in the program, it's print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])

So, it's a + floor(b / 3), but with a condition [c < b % 3]

Wait, but b is b + c

So, b % 3 is (b + c) % 3

In the second sample, c=1 < (5 % 3)=2, so c < b % 3 is true, so print -1

Which matches the sample.

In the first sample, c=3 >= (5 % 3)=2, so print a + floor(b / 3)=1 +1=2

But the correct answer is 3.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be a + ceil((b + c)/3)=1 + floor(7/3)=2, but correct is 3.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in the ceil function.

Wait, in Python, ceil(x) is equivalent to (x + 2) // 3 for integer x.

Wait, but floor(x) is x // 3

Ceil(x) is (x + 2) // 3

So, a + ceil((b + c)/3)=a + (b + c + 2) // 3

But in the program, it's a + floor(b / 3)=a + b // 3

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be a - -(b + c) // 3, which is a + floor((b + c)/3)

But in the first sample, a + floor((b + c)/3)=1 + floor(5/3)=1 +1=2, but correct is 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is a + ceil((b + c)/3)

Which is a + (b + c + 2) // 3

In the first sample, 1 + (5 + 2)//3=1 +7//3=1 +2=3, which matches.

In the second sample, 1 + (5 + 2)//3=1 +7//3=1 +2=3, but correct is -1

So, the program needs to check if c >= required, where required is [0,2,1][b % 3]

In the second sample, b=4, b % 3=1, required=2

c=1 <2, so -1

Otherwise, a + ceil((b + c)/3)

Wait, but in the program, it's checking c < b % 3, where b is b + c

In the second sample, b + c=5, 5 % 3=2

c=1 <2, so -1

Which matches.

In the first sample, b + c=5, 5 % 3=2

c=3 >=2, so a + floor(b / 3)=1 +1=2, but correct is 3.

Wait, discrepancy again.

Wait, perhaps the program should be a + (b + c + 2) // 3

But in Python, a - -(b + c) // 3 would be a + floor((b + c)/3)

But in the program, it's a - -b // 3, where b is b + c

So, a + floor(b / 3)

But floor(b / 3) is floor((b + c)/3), which is not equal to ceil((b + c)/3)

Unless b + c >=0, floor((b + c + 2)/3) = floor((b + c)/3) + something

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach.

Let me consider that ceil(x) = -floor(-x)

So, ceil((b + c)/3) = -floor(-(b + c)/3)

So, a + ceil((b + c)/3) = a - floor(-(b + c)/3)

But in the program, it's a - -b // 3, which is a + floor(b / 3)

Wait, perhaps it's a typo.

Wait, perhaps it should be a - -(b + c) // 3, which is a + floor((b + c)/3)

But earlier, I saw that a + floor((b + c)/3) doesn't match the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion with operator precedence.

Wait, perhaps a - -b // 3 is a - (- (b // 3)) = a + (b // 3)

But I need a + ceil((b + c)/3)

Which is a - floor(-(b + c)/3)

Wait, perhaps in the program, it's intended to be a - -(b + c) // 3, which is a + floor((b + c)/3)

But as we saw, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the expression is incorrect.

Let me check with another sample.

Take the third sample:

a=1, b=4, c=2

b += c → b=6

floor(6 / 3)=2

a +2=3, which matches the sample output.

But according to my earlier formula, required = [0,2,1][4 % 3]=2

c=2 >=2, so a + ceil((b + c)/3)=1 + ceil(6/3)=1 +2=3, which matches.

In the second sample, a=1, b=4, c=1

b += c → b=5

floor(5 / 3)=1

a +1=2, but correct is -1

But according to my formula, required=2, c=1 <2, so -1

Hence, the program seems to be correctly implementing a + ceil((b + c)/3), with a condition to check if c >= required.

Wait, but in the program, it's [c < b % 3], but b is b + c

Wait, perhaps in the program, it's checking c < (b + c) % 3

In the second sample, c=1
