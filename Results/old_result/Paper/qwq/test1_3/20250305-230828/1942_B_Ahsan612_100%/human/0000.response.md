Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Farmer John has a permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and he gives Bessie an array a, where each a_i is calculated as the MEX of the first i elements of p minus p_i. My task is to reconstruct the permutation p from the array a.

First, I need to understand what MEX means. MEX stands for Minimum EXcluded number, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given array. For example, MEX of [1,2,3] is 0 because 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array. MEX of [3,1,0] is 2, since 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is missing.

So, for each position i in the permutation p, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i. I need to find p given a.

The problem says that there is at least one valid p for the given a, so I don't have to worry about invalid inputs.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since p is a permutation, each number from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once. Also, MEX of the first i elements of p will be a number between 0 and n, inclusive, because it's the smallest non-negative integer not in the first i elements.

Given that, a_i can range from -n to n, since p_i is between 0 and n-1, and MEX can be from 0 to n.

I need to find p such that for each i, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

I need to find a way to reconstruct p from a.

Let me consider the properties of MEX and how it changes as we add elements to the permutation.

I know that MEX(p_1 to p_i) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in p_1 to p_i.

So, if I can keep track of which numbers have appeared so far, I can determine the MEX for each prefix.

But I need to do this in reverse, because I have a and need to find p.

Maybe I can iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the MEX as I go.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 5

a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]

The expected p is [0,1,4,2,3]

Let's verify that:

For i=1: MEX(0) = 1, a_1 = 1 - 0 = 1

For i=2: MEX(0,1) = 2 - 1 = 1

For i=3: MEX(0,1,4) = 2 - 4 = -2

For i=4: MEX(0,1,4,2) = 3 - 2 = 1

For i=5: MEX(0,1,4,2,3) = 5 - 3 = 2

Yes, that matches.

Now, how to reconstruct p from a.

Let me think about the last element.

For i=5, a_5 = MEX(p_1 to p_5) - p_5 = 2

MEX(p_1 to p_5) would be the smallest non-negative integer not in p, which since p is a permutation of 0 to 4, MEX should be 5.

So, 5 - p_5 = 2 => p_5 = 3

Similarly, for i=4, MEX(p_1 to p_4) - p_4 = 1

MEX(p_1 to p_4) is 3 (since p_5 is 3, and p_1 to p_4 are 0,1,4,2)

3 - p_4 = 1 => p_4 = 2

For i=3, MEX(p_1 to p3) - p3 = -2

MEX(p1 to p3) is 2

2 - p3 = -2 => p3 = 4

And so on.

So, it seems like I can calculate p_i = MEX(p1 to p_i) - a_i

But MEX(p1 to p_i) is unknown, but I can maybe find a way to compute it.

Wait, in the above example, for i=5, MEX is 5, for i=4, it's 3, for i=3, it's 2, etc.

I need a way to find MEX for each prefix.

Maybe I can keep track of the numbers that have appeared so far and find the smallest missing one.

But since I don't know p yet, I need another way.

Perhaps I can iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the MEX up to that point.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote MEX_i = MEX(p1, p2, ..., pi)

Then, a_i = MEX_i - p_i => p_i = MEX_i - a_i

I need to find p_i for all i.

I need to find a way to compute MEX_i for each i.

Let's think about how MEX changes as we add elements to the permutation.

Initially, for i=1, MEX_1 = MEX(p1) = smallest non-negative integer not equal to p1.

For i=2, MEX_2 = MEX(p1, p2) = smallest non-negative integer not in {p1, p2}.

And so on, up to i=n.

Also, since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, MEX_n should be n, because all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present.

Wait, in the example, for i=5, MEX_5 = 5.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, MEX_i is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to pi.

I need to find a way to compute MEX_i for each i, given a_i = MEX_i - p_i.

I need to find p_i, and ensure that p is a permutation, i.e., all p_i are distinct and range from 0 to n-1.

Let me consider iterating from i=n down to i=1.

At each step, I can compute p_i = MEX_i - a_i.

But I need to know MEX_i.

I can initialize MEX_n = n, since p1 to pn contain all numbers from 0 to n-1.

Then, for i=n-1 down to 1:

- p_i = MEX_i - a_i

- MEX_i is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to pi.

But I don't know p1 to pi yet.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the MEX as I go backwards.

Let me try with the example.

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Start with i=5:

MEX_5 = 5 (since p1 to p5 are 0,1,4,2,3)

p5 = MEX_5 - a5 = 5 - 2 = 3

Now, for i=4:

MEX_4 = MEX(p1 to p4) = 3 (since p1 to p4 are 0,1,4,2)

p4 = MEX_4 - a4 = 3 - 1 = 2

Now, for i=3:

MEX_3 = MEX(p1 to p3) = 2 (since p1 to p3 are 0,1,4)

p3 = MEX_3 - a3 = 2 - (-2) = 4

For i=2:

MEX_2 = MEX(p1,p2) = 2 (since p1 and p2 are 0 and 1)

p2 = MEX_2 - a2 = 2 - 1 = 1

For i=1:

MEX_1 = MEX(p1) = 1 (since p1 is 0)

p1 = MEX_1 - a1 = 1 - 1 = 0

So, p = [0,1,4,2,3]

This seems to work.

So, the approach is:

- Start from i=n.

- Set MEX_n = n.

- For each i from n down to 1:

- p_i = MEX_i - a_i

- If p_i < MEX_i, then MEX_{i-1} = p_i

- Else, MEX_{i-1} = MEX_i

Wait, how do I determine MEX_{i-1} based on MEX_i and p_i?

Let's think about it.

When I add p_i to the previous elements p1 to p_{i-1}, MEX_{i-1} is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to p_{i-1}.

After adding p_i, MEX_i is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to p_i.

So, if p_i is greater than MEX_{i-1}, then MEX_i remains MEX_{i-1}.

Otherwise, MEX_i is MEX_{i-1} + 1 if p_i == MEX_{i-1}.

Wait, no.

Actually, when you add p_i to p1 to p_{i-1}, if p_i is equal to MEX_{i-1}, then MEX_i becomes MEX_{i-1} + 1.

Otherwise, if p_i is less than MEX_{i-1}, then MEX_i remains MEX_{i-1}.

If p_i is greater than MEX_{i-1}, then MEX_i remains MEX_{i-1}.

Wait, no.

Actually, MEX_i is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to p_i.

If p_i is less than MEX_{i-1}, then p_i was not in p1 to p_{i-1}, so MEX_i remains MEX_{i-1}.

If p_i is equal to MEX_{i-1}, then MEX_i becomes MEX_{i-1} + 1.

If p_i is greater than MEX_{i-1}, then MEX_i remains MEX_{i-1}.

So, in code, MEX_i = MEX_{i-1} if p_i != MEX_{i-1} else MEX_{i-1} + 1

But in the earlier steps, I set p_i = MEX_i - a_i

Then, to find MEX_{i-1}, I need to see if p_i == MEX_i - 1

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to generalize this.

Given that p_i = MEX_i - a_i, and MEX_i is known for i=n, which is n, I can compute p_n.

Then, to find MEX_{n-1}, I need to see if p_n affects the MEX from n-1 to n.

Wait, maybe it's better to iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of MEX.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize MEX = n

For i from n down to 1:

p_i = MEX - a_i

If p_i < MEX:

MEX = p_i

This seems to match the earlier steps.

In the example:

i=5:

p5 = 5 - 2 = 3

Since 3 < 5, MEX = 3

i=4:

p4 = 3 - 1 = 2

Since 2 < 3, MEX = 2

i=3:

p3 = 2 - (-2) = 4

Since 4 >= 2, MEX remains 2

i=2:

p2 = 2 - 1 = 1

Since 1 < 2, MEX = 1

i=1:

p1 = 1 - 1 = 0

Since 0 < 1, MEX = 0

This matches the earlier reconstruction.

So, the algorithm is:

- Start with MEX = n

- For each i from n down to 1:

- p_i = MEX - a_i

- If p_i < MEX, then set MEX = p_i

- Output p as the array of p_i's

This seems correct based on the example.

Let me check another test case.

Second test case:

n=5

a=[1,1,1,1,1]

Expected p=[0,1,2,3,4]

Let's apply the algorithm:

Initialize MEX=5

i=5:

p5=5-1=4

Since 4 < 5, MEX=4

i=4:

p4=4-1=3

Since 3 < 4, MEX=3

i=3:

p3=3-1=2

Since 2 < 3, MEX=2

i=2:

p2=2-1=1

Since 1 < 2, MEX=1

i=1:

p1=1-1=0

Since 0 < 1, MEX=0

So, p=[0,1,2,3,4]

Which matches the expected output.

Third test case:

n=3

a=[-2,1,2]

Expected p=[2,0,1]

Let's apply the algorithm:

Initialize MEX=3

i=3:

p3=3-2=1

Since 1 < 3, MEX=1

i=2:

p2=1-1=0

Since 0 < 1, MEX=0

i=1:

p1=0 - (-2)=2

Since 2 > 0, MEX remains 0

So, p=[2,0,1], which matches the expected output.

Great, so this algorithm seems to work for the given examples.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

Constraints:

- t <= 10^4

- n <= 2*10^5

- Sum of n over all test cases <= 2*10^5

So, per test case, time complexity should be O(n), and overall O(2*10^5)

Space complexity should be O(n) per test case, but since n is up to 2*10^5, need to be careful with memory.

In Python, lists of size 2*10^5 should be fine.

I need to read t test cases, each consisting of n and then a list of n integers a.

For each test case, I need to output the corresponding p.

In the code provided, it seems to implement this algorithm.

Let me look at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

ar = list(map(int, input().split()))

res = [None] * n

mex = n

for i in range(len(ar)-1, -1, -1):

res[i] = mex - ar[i]

if mex > mex - ar[i]:

mex = mex - ar[i]

print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

This matches the algorithm I derived.

It iterates from the end to the beginning, calculates p_i = mex - a_i, and updates mex if p_i < mex.

Given that the problem guarantees at least one valid p exists, I don't need to handle cases where no such p exists.

I should also ensure that p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, but since the problem guarantees a valid p exists, and the algorithm seems correct, this should be fine.

I should also make sure that all p_i are unique and within 0 to n-1, but again, given the problem's guarantee, this should hold.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1

a=[1]

Then, MEX(p1) - p1 = 1

So, MEX(p1) = 1 - p1

But MEX(p1) is the smallest non-negative integer not equal to p1.

If p1=0, MEX(p1)=1, then 1 - 0 =1, which matches.

If p1=1, MEX(p1)=0, then 0 - 1 =-1, which doesn't match a=1.

So, p1=0 is the only possibility.

Another edge case: n=2

a=[1,0]

Then, for i=2: MEX(p1,p2) - p2 =0

MEX(p1,p2): since p1 and p2 are 0 and 1 in some order, MEX is 2.

So, 2 - p2 =0 => p2=2

But p2 should be less than 2, since p is a permutation of 0,1. Contradiction.

Wait, but the problem says n >=1, and p is a permutation of 0 to n-1.

Wait, in this case, p2 cannot be 2, since n=2, p2 should be 0 or 1.

But according to the equation, 2 - p2 =0 => p2=2, which is invalid.

But the problem says that inputs are such that at least one valid p exists, so this case wouldn't occur.

Another edge case: n=2

a=[1,1]

Then, p1=0, p2=1

Check:

MEX(p1)=1 -0=1

MEX(p1,p2)=2 -1=1

Which matches a=[1,1]

Another edge case: n=2

a=[1,2]

Then, p1=0, p2=0

But p2=0, but p1=0, which is not a permutation.

Wait, but p should be a permutation of 0,1, so this is invalid.

But the problem says that inputs are such that at least one valid p exists, so this input wouldn't be given.

Given that, I can assume that the input is always valid and has at least one corresponding p.

Therefore, I don't need to handle invalid cases.

Looking back at the code, it seems correct based on the algorithm I derived.

It iterates from the end to the beginning, calculates p_i = mex - a_i, and updates mex if p_i < mex.

This should work as per the examples and the reasoning above.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**
