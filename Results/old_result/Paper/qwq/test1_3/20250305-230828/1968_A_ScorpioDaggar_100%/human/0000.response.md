Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, such that when I add y to the greatest common divisor of x and y, I get the maximum possible value. And I have to do this for multiple test cases.

First, I need to understand what gcd(x, y) is. GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, which is the largest positive integer that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. For example, gcd(6, 4) is 2, as you mentioned.

So, the expression I'm trying to maximize is gcd(x, y) + y. I need to find y (where y is between 1 and x-1) that makes this sum as large as possible.

Let me think about how gcd(x, y) behaves. If y is a divisor of x, then gcd(x, y) is equal to y. Because y divides x perfectly. So, in that case, gcd(x, y) + y would be y + y = 2y.

If y is not a divisor of x, then gcd(x, y) is some smaller value that divides both x and y.

So, if y is a divisor of x, the sum is 2y. If y is not a divisor, the sum is less than 2y.

Therefore, to maximize gcd(x, y) + y, it seems beneficial to choose y that is a divisor of x, because then the sum is 2y, which can be larger than gcd(x, y) + y when y is not a divisor.

But y has to be less than x, as per the problem statement.

So, among all divisors of x that are less than x, I should choose the one that maximizes 2y, which would simply be the largest divisor of x that is less than x.

Wait a minute, is that correct? Let's verify with an example.

Take x = 10.

Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. But y must be less than x, so y can be 1, 2, or 5.

Now, calculate gcd(x, y) + y for each:

- y=1: gcd(10,1)=1, so 1 + 1 = 2

- y=2: gcd(10,2)=2, so 2 + 2 = 4

- y=5: gcd(10,5)=5, so 5 + 5 = 10

So, the maximum is 10, achieved when y=5.

In this case, y=5 is the largest divisor of x=10 that is less than x.

Another example: x=7, which is prime.

Divisors of 7 are 1 and 7. y can be 1 only.

gcd(7,1)+1 = 1 + 1 = 2

So, y=1 is the only option.

But according to the sample input, for x=7, the output is y=6.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier assumption.

Wait, x=7 is prime, so its only divisors are 1 and 7. But y=6 is not a divisor of 7.

Let's calculate gcd(7,6)+6 = gcd(7,6)=1, so 1 + 6 = 7.

Similarly, for y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

For y=2: gcd(7,2)=1, so 1 + 2 = 3

For y=3: gcd(7,3)=1, so 1 + 3 = 4

For y=4: gcd(7,4)=1, so 1 + 4 = 5

For y=5: gcd(7,5)=1, so 1 + 5 = 6

For y=6: gcd(7,6)=1, so 1 + 6 = 7

Indeed, the maximum is 7, achieved when y=6.

But y=6 is not a divisor of x=7.

So, in this case, even though y=6 is not a divisor of x=7, it gives a higher sum than any divisor.

Wait, but in the earlier case with x=10, y=5, which is a divisor, gave the maximum sum.

So, my initial assumption that y should be a divisor of x to maximize gcd(x, y) + y is not always true.

In the case of x=7, y=6, which is not a divisor, gives a higher sum than y=5 would, but x=7 doesn't have y=5 as a divisor.

Wait, no, x=7 has y=1 as the only divisor less than x.

Wait, x=7 has divisors 1 and 7, so y can only be 1.

But according to the sample input, for x=7, the output is y=6.

So, in this case, y=6 is better than y=1.

So, perhaps choosing y to be x-1 is a good strategy.

Let's test this idea with another example.

Take x=21.

Divisors of 21 are 1, 3, 7, 21. y can be 1, 3, 7.

Calculate gcd(x,y)+y for each:

- y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

- y=3: 3 + 3 = 6

- y=7: 7 + 7 = 14

Now, y=20: gcd(21,20)=1, so 1 + 20 = 21

y=20 gives a higher sum than any divisor.

Similarly, y=18: gcd(21,18)=3, so 3 + 18 = 21

Wait, y=18 gives the same sum as y=20.

But according to the sample input, for x=21, the output is y=18.

So, y=18 is acceptable, but y=20 also gives the same sum.

So, multiple y can achieve the maximum sum.

The problem says that any y that achieves the maximum is acceptable.

So, in this case, y=18 is acceptable.

Another example: x=100.

Divisors less than x: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50.

Calculate gcd(x,y)+y for each:

- y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

- y=2: 2 + 2 = 4

- y=4: 4 + 4 = 8

- y=5: 5 + 5 = 10

- y=10: 10 + 10 = 20

- y=20: 20 + 20 = 40

- y=25: 25 + 25 = 50

- y=50: 50 + 50 = 100

Now, y=99: gcd(100,99)=1, so 1 + 99 = 100

y=98: gcd(100,98)=2, so 2 + 98 = 100

y=95: gcd(100,95)=5, so 5 + 95 = 100

y=90: gcd(100,90)=10, so 10 + 90 = 100

y=75: gcd(100,75)=25, so 25 + 75 = 100

So, multiple y give the sum of 100.

The sample output for x=100 is y=98, which is acceptable.

Similarly, y=99, y=95, y=90, y=75, etc., all give the same sum.

So, choosing y=x-2 or y=x-1 or others can achieve the maximum sum.

But is there a pattern here?

In the case of x=10, y=5 gives sum=10

x=7, y=6 gives sum=7

x=21, y=18 gives sum=21

x=100, y=98 gives sum=100

x=2, y=1 gives sum=2

x=1000, y=750 gives sum=750 + gcd(1000,750)=250, so 750 + 250 = 1000

x=6, y=3 gives sum=3 + 3 = 6

Wait, but in the sample input, for x=6, y=3 is given, which gives sum=6.

But y=5: gcd(6,5)=1, so 1 + 5 = 6

y=4: gcd(6,4)=2, so 2 + 4 = 6

y=3: gcd(6,3)=3, so 3 + 3 = 6

y=2: gcd(6,2)=2, so 2 + 2 = 4

y=1: gcd(6,1)=1, so 1 + 1 = 2

So, y=3,4,5 all give sum=6.

The sample output is y=3, which is acceptable.

So, in this case, y=3 is a divisor, but y=4 and y=5 are not.

So, again, choosing y as a divisor can achieve the maximum, but it's not necessary.

So, perhaps the strategy is to choose y such that gcd(x,y) is as large as possible, and y is as large as possible.

Wait, but in x=7, y=6 is chosen, which has gcd=1, but y is large.

In x=1000, y=750 is chosen, which has gcd=250.

So, it seems that choosing y such that y is large and gcd(x,y) is also large can achieve a high sum.

But how to balance these two?

Wait, in x=1000, y=750 gives sum=750 + 250 = 1000

But y=999: gcd(1000,999)=1, so 1 + 999 = 1000

y=998: gcd(1000,998)=2, so 2 + 998 = 1000

y=995: gcd(1000,995)=5, so 5 + 995 = 1000

y=990: gcd(1000,990)=10, so 10 + 990 = 1000

y=750: gcd(1000,750)=250, so 250 + 750 = 1000

So, multiple y achieve the same sum.

So, perhaps the maximum sum is x + floor(x/2), but in x=10, y=5 gives sum=10, which is equal to x.

Wait, no, in x=10, y=5 gives sum=10, which equals x.

In x=7, y=6 gives sum=7, which equals x.

In x=21, y=18 gives sum=21, which equals x.

In x=100, y=98 gives sum=100, which equals x.

In x=2, y=1 gives sum=2, which equals x.

In x=1000, y=750 gives sum=1000, which equals x.

In x=6, y=3 gives sum=6, which equals x.

So, in all these cases, the sum is equal to x.

Wait, but in x=10, y=5: gcd(10,5)=5, so 5 + 5 = 10, which equals x.

Wait, x=10, y=5: 5 + 5 = 10

x=7, y=6: gcd(7,6)=1, so 1 + 6 = 7

x=21, y=18: gcd(21,18)=3, so 3 + 18 = 21

x=100, y=98: gcd(100,98)=2, so 2 + 98 = 100

x=2, y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

x=1000, y=750: gcd(1000,750)=250, so 250 + 750 = 1000

x=6, y=3: 3 + 3 = 6

So, in all these cases, gcd(x,y) + y = x.

Is this always true?

Let's see.

gcd(x,y) + y = x

Which implies gcd(x,y) = x - y

Is this always true for some y < x?

Well, for y = x - gcd(x,y)

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, gcd(x,y) divides both x and y, so it must divide x - y.

Wait, gcd(x,y) divides x and y, so it divides any linear combination of x and y, like x - y.

But in this case, gcd(x,y) = x - y, as per above.

So, x - y must divide both x and y.

Let me see.

If d = gcd(x,y), then d divides x and d divides y.

Also, d = x - y.

So, d divides x and d divides y, and d = x - y.

This seems consistent.

But is this always possible?

Wait, for x=10, y=5: x - y = 5, which is d=5, which divides both x and y.

For x=7, y=6: x - y =1, which is d=1, which divides both.

For x=21, y=18: x - y=3, which is d=3, which divides both.

So, in all cases, d = x - y divides both x and y.

This seems to hold.

So, perhaps for any y < x, as long as x - y divides y, then gcd(x,y) + y = x.

Wait, let's see.

gcd(x,y) = x - y, and y = y.

So, sum is x - y + y = x.

So, for any y < x, if x - y divides y, then gcd(x,y) + y = x.

Wait, but x - y divides y if and only if x - y divides x - y + y = x.

Wait, x - y divides y if and only if x - y divides x.

Because x - y divides x - y and divides x, so it divides y = x - (x - y).

Wait, it's a bit confusing.

Let me rephrase.

If d = x - y, and d divides x, then d divides y, because y = x - d.

Similarly, d divides x and d divides y, so d divides gcd(x,y).

But d = x - y, so d <= gcd(x,y).

But d also divides gcd(x,y), since d divides both x and y.

Wait, this seems circular.

Perhaps it's simpler to note that gcd(x,y) = gcd(x, x - y).

Because gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, x - y).

This is a standard property of gcd.

So, gcd(x,y) = gcd(x, x - y).

But x - y = d, so gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, d).

But d divides x, so gcd(x, d) = d.

Therefore, gcd(x, y) = d = x - y.

Therefore, gcd(x, y) + y = (x - y) + y = x.

So, for any y < x where x - y divides x, then gcd(x, y) + y = x.

Therefore, to maximize gcd(x, y) + y, we can choose any y where x - y divides x.

And in the sample inputs, they have chosen such y.

So, the maximum possible sum is x, and any y where x - y divides x will achieve this sum.

Therefore, to solve the problem, we need to find any y < x such that x - y divides x.

Alternatively, since x - y divides x, then y = x - d, where d divides x.

So, y = x - d, for some divisor d of x.

Since y < x, d must be at least 1.

So, to find y, we can choose y = x - d, where d is any divisor of x.

And to maximize y, we can choose d to be the smallest divisor, which is 1.

Therefore, y = x - 1.

But in some cases, like x=10, y=5 is chosen, which is not x - 1.

But according to the above, y = x - 1 is always acceptable, as long as 1 divides x, which it always does.

So, y = x - 1 is always a valid choice that achieves the sum x.

Therefore, a simple strategy is to choose y = x - 1 for each x.

This will ensure that gcd(x, y) + y = x.

And since the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum, y = x - 1 is always acceptable.

This seems like an easy and efficient solution.

Let's verify this with the sample inputs.

For x=10, y=10-1=9, but in the sample, y=5 is given.

But y=9: gcd(10,9)=1, so 1 + 9 = 10, which matches x.

Similarly, y=5: gcd(10,5)=5, so 5 + 5 = 10, which also matches x.

So, both y=5 and y=9 are acceptable.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6: gcd(7,6)=1, so 1 + 6 = 7.

y=7-1=6, which matches the sample output.

For x=21, y=18: gcd(21,18)=3, so 3 + 18 = 21.

y=21-3=18, which matches the sample.

For x=100, y=98: gcd(100,98)=2, so 2 + 98 = 100.

y=100-2=98, which matches.

For x=2, y=1: gcd(2,1)=1, so 1 + 1 = 2.

y=2-1=1, which matches.

For x=1000, y=750: gcd(1000,750)=250, so 250 + 750 = 1000.

But y=1000-250=750, which matches.

For x=6, y=3: gcd(6,3)=3, so 3 + 3 = 6.

y=6-3=3, which matches.

So, in all these cases, choosing y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, achieves the sum x.

And choosing d=1, y = x - 1, also achieves the sum x.

Therefore, a simple solution is to set y = x - 1 for each x.

This ensures that gcd(x, y) + y = x, which is the maximum possible sum, since x is the upper limit.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic.

The program is as follows:

from math import gcd

def func():

n: int = int(input(''))

for _ in range(n):

x: int = int(input(''))

max = -1

argmax_y = -1

for y in range(1, x):

eq = gcd(x, y) + y

if eq > max:

max = eq

argmax_y = y

print(argmax_y)

So, the program reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads x, and then iterates y from 1 to x-1, calculating gcd(x, y) + y, and keeps track of the y that gives the maximum value.

Finally, it prints that y.

This is a brute-force approach, checking all possible y to find the one that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

Given that x can be up to 1000 and t can be up to 1000, this should be efficient enough, as 1000 * 999 = 999,000 operations, which is acceptable for Python.

But, according to our earlier reasoning, we can optimize this by directly choosing y = x - 1, which always achieves the maximum sum of x.

But the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum, so choosing y = x - 1 is acceptable.

However, the provided program checks all y and finds the one that gives the maximum sum.

So, it should also work correctly.

But, is there any case where this program might not output y = x - 1, but another y that also achieves the same sum?

Yes, as seen in the sample inputs, for x=10, y=5 is chosen instead of y=9.

But both y=5 and y=9 achieve the same sum of 10.

So, the program is allowed to output either, as long as it achieves the maximum sum.

Therefore, the program is correct in finding any y that achieves the maximum sum.

Hence, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
