Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning step by step, then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

# Program:
from math import gcd

def func():
    n: int = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(n):
        x: int = int(input(''))
        max = -1
        argmax_y = -1
        for y in range(1, x):
            eq = gcd(x, y) + y
            if eq > max:
                max = eq
                argmax_y = y
        print(argmax_y)



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
Don't forger in the end of your reasoning to print Correctness: **True** or **False**
