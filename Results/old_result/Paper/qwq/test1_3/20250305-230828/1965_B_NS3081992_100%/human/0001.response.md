Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there must be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints, and I need to output the sequence for each test case.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], its subsequences include [], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], and [1,2,3].

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no combination of its elements sums to k, but for every other value v (1 ≤ v ≤ n, v ≠ k), there is some combination of elements that sums to v.

This sounds a lot like the subset sum problem, which is known to be NP-complete in general. However, since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and the constraints on n and k are given, there must be a smarter way to construct such a sequence.

Let me think about the properties such a sequence should have.

First, since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and the elements can be up to 10^9, size isn't extremely large, but we need an efficient way to ensure the conditions are met.

I recall that with a set of elements, the number of possible subsets is 2^m, where m is the number of elements. Here, m ≤ 25, so 2^25 is 33,554,432, which is manageable, but I don't want to deal with that many subsets explicitly.

I need a way to construct the sequence so that all sums from 1 to n are possible except for k.

One idea is to include elements that cover all sums up to n, except block the sum k.

I know that with coins of denominations that are powers of 2, I can make any sum. For example, with [1, 2, 4, 8], I can make any sum from 1 to 15. But in this problem, I need to exclude one particular sum, k.

So, perhaps I can start with a base sequence that allows me to make all sums from 1 to some value, and then adjust it to exclude k.

Wait, but the problem says n can be up to 10^6, and k can be up to n, so I need a general approach.

Let me consider the properties of the sequence.

If I include 0 in the sequence, it doesn't help because it doesn't change any sums. So, I can assume that all elements are positive integers.

Also, duplicates are allowed, but maybe it's better to have unique elements to make summing easier.

I need to ensure that for every v from 1 to n, except k, there exists a subsequence whose sum is v.

One way to ensure that almost all sums are possible is to use a combination of small numbers that can cover the lower sums and larger numbers to cover higher sums.

But I need to block the sum k specifically.

An idea: include elements that allow summing to all values except k.

For example, if k=2, and n=3, I can have [1,3]. With this, I can make 1 and 3, but not 2.

Wait, but in this case, [1,3] allows summing to 1, 3, and 1+3=4, but n=3, so 4 is beyond n.

But in this example, for n=3, k=2, [1,3] works because I can make 1 and 3, but not 2.

But n can be up to 10^6, so I need a general strategy.

Another idea: use a greedy approach. Start with the smallest possible elements and ensure that k cannot be formed.

But I need a more systematic way.

Let me think in terms of binary representations.

Since 2^25 is over 33 million, which is larger than n=10^6, maybe I can select elements that correspond to certain binary positions, but adjust to exclude k.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements that correspond to powers of 2 up to a certain point, and adjust for k.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed, while all other sums from 1 to n can be formed.

Another thought: If I have a set that can form all sums from 1 to n except k, then the minimal number of elements required is logarithmic in n.

But the problem allows up to 25 elements, which is more than enough for n up to 10^6.

Wait, 2^20 is 1,048,576, which is greater than 10^6, so with 20 elements, I can cover sums up to 10^6 using powers of 2.

But I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps starting with powers of 2 up to 2^20, and then adjust to exclude k.

But if I include all powers of 2 up to 2^20, I can make any sum from 1 to 1,048,575 by choosing subsets.

But I need to exclude k, so maybe I can modify the set to make k unachievable.

One way to make k unachievable is to remove some elements that sum up to k, but that might not work because subsets can combine elements in various ways.

Another idea: include elements that allow summing to all values except k.

Suppose I have a set that can sum to all values except k, how can I construct it?

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that cover all sums up to n, except k, by carefully choosing which elements to include.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with an empty set.

- Iterate through each value from 1 to n.

- For each value v, if v != k, ensure that there's a subset that sums to v.

- If v == k, ensure that no subset sums to k.

To implement this, I need a way to add elements to the set such that all sums except k are possible.

This sounds tricky.

An alternative approach: use the fact that with a set of elements, the subset sum problem can be modeled using dynamic programming.

But since m ≤ 25, I can afford to work with subsets explicitly.

Wait, but even with m=25, 2^25 is 33 million, which is too large to handle subset by subset.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of the set.

Suppose I have a set A that can sum to any value from 1 to s, except for k.

Then, for any v from 1 to s, v != k, there exists a subset of A that sums to v.

Moreover, no subset sums to k.

I need to maximize s, but in this problem, s should be at least n.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and m ≤ 25, I need to choose m elements that can cover sums up to 10^6, excluding one specific sum k.

This seems challenging, but perhaps there's a way to construct such a set.

Let me consider starting with the minimal set that can sum to all numbers up to n, which would be the set of powers of 2 up to the largest power less than or equal to n.

For example, if n=10, I would take [1,2,4,8], which allows summing to any number up to 15, but I only need up to 10.

But I need to exclude k.

So, to exclude k, perhaps I can modify the set by removing or adding certain elements.

Wait, but removing elements might not be sufficient because subsets can combine elements in various ways.

Another idea: include elements that allow summing to all values except k by ensuring that k cannot be formed.

One way to ensure that k cannot be formed is to make sure that no combination of elements sums to k.

But ensuring that all other sums are possible is tricky.

Let me consider the following strategy:

- Start with a minimal set that can sum to all values up to n.

- Adjust the set so that k cannot be formed.

For example, if I have the set [1,2,4,8], I can form any sum up to 15.

If k=5, I need to adjust the set so that 5 cannot be formed.

One way is to remove 4 and add 3, so the set becomes [1,2,3,8].

Now, sums possible are:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [3]

- 4: [1,3]

- 5: [2,3] → but this sums to 5, which is k. So, this is not acceptable.

Hmm, so this approach doesn't work.

Another idea: include elements that sum to all values except k by ensuring that k is the only value that cannot be formed.

Wait, but how?

Perhaps I can include elements that cover all sums except k by carefully choosing their values.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with the set of powers of 2 up to the largest power less than or equal to n.

- Adjust the set by replacing or adding elements to block the sum k.

For example, if k=5 and n=10, starting with [1,2,4,8].

To block 5, I can remove 4 and add 3, but as above, that allows 1+2+3=6, which is fine, but also 2+3=5, which is k.

So, that doesn't work.

Another idea: include elements that allow summing to all values except k by ensuring that k is the only gap in the possible sums.

This seems difficult.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can sum to all values from 1 to n except k.

Then, for every v from 1 to n, v != k, there exists a subset of A that sums to v.

Moreover, no subset sums to k.

I need to construct such a set A with at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and m ≤ 25, I need an efficient way to cover the sum space up to n, excluding k.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Use a subset of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

- To block k, I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

- To achieve this, perhaps I can include elements that cover all sums except k by carefully choosing their values.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the minimal number of elements required to cover the sums.

But I need to ensure that k is excluded.

Another idea: use the fact that with m elements, the number of possible subsets is 2^m.

But 2^25 is about 33 million, which is more than enough to cover n=10^6.

But I need to ensure that among these subsets, none sum to k, but all other sums from 1 to n (except k) are possible.

This seems complex.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a set that can sum to all values from 1 to n, except k.

- One way to do this is to include elements that cover all possible sums except k.

- To block k, I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

- To achieve this, perhaps I can include elements that are such that any subset that would sum to k is blocked by the absence of certain elements.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think of small examples to see a pattern.

Example 1:

n=2, k=2

Possible sequence: [1]

- Subsequences: [], [1]

- Sums: 0, 1

- No subsequence sums to 2, which is fine.

- We can make 1, which is v=1.

- v=2 is k, so it's excluded.

Good.

Example 2:

n=6, k=1

Possible sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

- Subsequences:

- [], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [2,3], [2,4], [2,5], [2,6], [3,4], [3,5], [3,6], [4,5], [4,6], [5,6], [2,3,4], etc.

- Sums: 0,2,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,8,7,8,9,9,10,11,...

- No subsequence sums to 1, which is k.

- Can make all other v from 2 to 6.

Good.

Example 3:

n=8, k=8

Possible sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- Subsequences can sum to any v from 1 to 7, but not 8.

- Since all elements are 1, and there are 7 of them, sums range from 0 to 7.

- Cannot sum to 8, which is k.

- Can make all v from 1 to 7.

Good.

Example 4:

n=9, k=3

Possible sequence: [7,1,4,1]

- Subsequences:

- [], [7], [1], [4], [1], [7,1], [7,4], [7,1], [1,4], [1,1], [7,1,4], [7,1,1], [7,4,1], [1,4,1], [7,1,4,1]

- Sums: 0,7,1,4,1,8,11,8,5,2,12,8,11,6,13

- No subsequence sums to 3.

- Can make other v from 1 to 9 except 3.

Wait, but in this sequence, I see sums like 1,2,5,6,7,8,11,12,13.

Missing sums are 4 and 9.

Wait, perhaps this is incorrect.

Wait, [7,1,4,1]:

- [4]: 4

- [7,1]:8

- [7,4]:11

- [1,4]:5

- [7,1,4]:12

- [1,1]:2

- [7,1,1]:9

- [4,1]:5

- [7,4,1]:12

- [7,1,4,1]:13

So sums are: 0,7,1,4,1,8,11,5,2,12,9,5,12,13

So sums possible: 0,1,2,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13

Missing sums: 3,6,10

But n=9, so sums from 1 to 9 are 1,2,4,5,7,8,9.

Missing 3 and 6.

But k=3, so it's okay to miss 3, but need to cover 6.

Wait, maybe this sequence is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps the sequence should be [7,1,4,1,6].

But that exceeds m=4.

Wait, in the example output, it's given as [7,1,4,1], but perhaps it's incorrect.

Wait, but it's in the example, so maybe I miscounted.

Wait, with [7,1,4,1], sums are:

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [7]:7

- [1]:1

- [1,1]:2

- [1,4]:5

- [1,7]:8

- [4,1]:5

- [7,1]:8

- [7,4]:11

- [1,1,4]:6

- [1,1,7]:9

- [1,4,7]:12

- [1,4,1]:6

- [7,1,4,1]:13

So sums: 0,1,4,7,2,5,8,6,9,11,12,13

Missing sums: 3,10

But n=9, so sums up to 9 are 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Missing 3.

k=3, which is correctly missing.

So, this sequence works.

Good.

Example 5:

n=10, k=7

Possible sequence: [1,2,8,3]

- Subsequences:

- [], [1], [2], [8], [3], [1,2], [1,8], [1,3], [2,8], [2,3], [8,3], [1,2,8], [1,2,3], [1,8,3], [2,8,3], [1,2,8,3]

- Sums: 0,1,2,8,3,3,9,4,10,5,11,6,11,12,13

So sums possible: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13

Missing sums: 7

Which is k=7.

And n=10, so sums from 1 to 10 except 7 are covered.

Good.

From these examples, I can see a pattern.

In the first example, with n=2 and k=2, sequence [1] works.

In the second example, with n=6 and k=1, sequence [2,3,4,5,6] works.

In the third example, with n=8 and k=8, sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] works.

In the fourth example, with n=9 and k=3, sequence [7,1,4,1] works.

In the fifth example, with n=10 and k=7, sequence [1,2,8,3] works.

Looking at these sequences, I notice that they include elements that allow summing to all values except k.

I need to generalize this.

One approach is to include elements that cover all possible sums except k.

To do this, I can start with a base set that covers all sums up to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

But how?

An idea: start with a set that can sum to all values from 1 to n, and then modify it by removing or adding elements to ensure that k cannot be formed.

But this seems vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can sum to all values from 1 to s, except k.

I need to construct such a set A with at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and m ≤ 25, I need an efficient way to cover the sum space up to n, excluding k.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Start with the minimal set that can sum to all values from 1 to n, which would be the set of powers of 2 up to the largest power less than or equal to n.

2. Adjust this set to ensure that k cannot be formed as a sum of any subset.

For example, if n=10 and k=7, the powers of 2 up to 10 are [1,2,4,8].

With these, I can form sums up to 15 (1+2+4+8=15), but I only need up to 10.

However, 1+2+4=7, which is k. So, I need to adjust the set to remove the possibility of summing to 7.

One way is to remove 4 and add 3, so the set becomes [1,2,3,8].

Now, let's see:

- Sums possible: 1,2,3,8,1+2=3,1+3=4,2+3=5,1+8=9,2+8=10,3+8=11,1+2+3=6,1+2+8=11,1+3+8=12,2+3+8=13,1+2+3+8=14

- Missing sums: 7

So, this works.

Similarly, in the fourth example, [7,1,4,1], sums possible exclude 3.

Wait, but in this set, 1+1+1=3, which is k=3.

Wait, but in the example, it's [7,1,4,1], and sums possible are 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13, but missing 3.

But 1+1+1=3, which should be included.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier.

Wait, with elements [7,1,4,1], possible subsets:

- []:0

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [7]:7

- [1]:1

- [1,4]:5

- [1,7]:8

- [4,1]:5

- [7,1]:8

- [7,4]:11

- [1,1,4]:6

- [1,1,7]:9

- [1,4,7]:12

- [1,4,1]:6

- [1,7,4,1]:13

So, sums: 0,1,4,7,5,8,6,9,11,12,13

Wait, but 1+1+1=3 is possible.

So, why is 3 not being formed in this sequence?

Wait, perhaps in the example, [7,1,4,1] is incorrect because it can sum to 3.

But in the example output, it's given as [7,1,4,1], but according to the problem, for n=9 and k=3, it should not be possible to sum to 3.

But in reality, with [7,1,4,1], you can sum to 3 using [1,1,1].

So, perhaps the example is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says "it can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists."

So, perhaps I need to find a different sequence for n=9 and k=3 that doesn't allow summing to 3.

Wait, maybe [7,1,4].

- Sums: 0,7,1,4,8,5,11,12

- Missing sums: 2,3,6,9,10

- So, 3 is missing, which is k=3.

- But v=9 is missing.

Wait, but n=9, so I need to cover up to 9, except k=3.

But in this set, 9 is missing.

Wait, perhaps adding another element, like [7,1,4,2].

- Sums: 0,7,1,4,2,8,5,9,6,10,11,12,13

- Missing sums: 3

- So, 3 is missing, which is k=3.

- And v=9 is covered.

So, [7,1,4,2] would be a valid sequence for n=9 and k=3.

But in the example, it's given as [7,1,4,1], which can sum to 3.

So, perhaps the example is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that no subset sums to k, even if multiple elements can be chosen.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "no subsequence with a sum of k", but in the example, [7,1,4,1] allows summing to 3 with [1,1,1].

So, perhaps the example is in error.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

But in the example, it's possible to sum to 3 with [1,1,1], which should be avoided.

So, perhaps the example is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem allows multiple instances of the same number.

So, perhaps there's a way to block summing to k by carefully choosing the elements.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the minimal number of elements is used to cover the sums.

But I need a general approach.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Start with the minimal set that can sum to all values up to n, which is the set of powers of 2 up to the largest power less than or equal to n.

- Then, adjust the set to ensure that k cannot be formed.

- To adjust, I can replace or remove certain elements.

For example, in the case where n=10 and k=7, starting with [1,2,4,8], which can sum to 7 with [1,2,4].

To prevent this, I can remove 4 and add 3, so the set becomes [1,2,3,8].

Now, [2,3] sums to 5, [1,2,3] sums to 6, but no subset sums to 7.

This works.

Similarly, for n=9 and k=3, I can use [7,1,4,2], as above.

Wait, but in the example, it's [7,1,4,1], which allows summing to 3 with [1,1,1].

So, perhaps the example is incorrect, or perhaps there's a different way to interpret it.

Wait, maybe the problem allows only unique elements in the sequence.

But in the problem
