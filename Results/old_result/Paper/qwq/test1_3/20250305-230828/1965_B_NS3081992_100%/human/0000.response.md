Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints, and I need to output the sequence for each test case.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], its subsequences include [], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], and [1,2,3].

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. The constraints say that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9. Also, the number of test cases is up to 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^7, which seems manageable.

First, I should consider the properties of the sequence that allow it to cover all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

One way to cover all sums efficiently is to use a set of numbers that allow binary representation. For example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, ...], each number is a power of 2, and any sum up to the total sum of the sequence can be represented uniquely by selecting a subset of these numbers.

However, in this problem, I need to exclude the sum k, while still being able to make all other sums up to n.

So, I need to modify this approach to exclude k.

One idea is to include numbers that cover all sums up to n, but adjust the sequence so that k cannot be formed.

Let me think about how to do that.

Option 1: Start with a standard binary sequence and adjust it.

For example, take the binary sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, ...] up to the point where the sum is at least n.

Then, modify it so that k cannot be formed.

But how?

One way is to remove some numbers and add others to block the sum k while ensuring other sums are still possible.

Option 2: Use the minimal number of elements to cover all sums up to n except k.

Since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and 25 is relatively small, I need an efficient way to cover the sums.

I recall that with a sequence of distinct positive integers, the number of possible subsets is 2^m, where m is the number of elements. Each subset has a unique sum if the sequence is a set of distinct positive integers.

Wait, no. Even with distinct positive integers, some subsets may have the same sum.

Actually, for the sequence to have unique subset sums, it should be a set where each element is greater than the sum of all previous elements. Like [1, 2, 4, 8, ...], where each number is double the previous one.

In such a sequence, each subset sum is unique.

So, in this case, if I have a sequence like [1, 2, 4, 8, ...], every sum from 1 to 2^m - 1 can be formed uniquely.

But in this problem, I need to exclude only one specific sum, k, while still being able to form all other sums up to n.

So, perhaps I can start with a sequence that covers all sums up to n and then adjust it to make sure that k cannot be formed.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of inclusion and exclusion.

Wait, another idea: include numbers that allow forming all sums except k.

One straightforward way is to include numbers that naturally exclude k, while including all others.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider the problem in terms of generating functions.

Each number in the sequence corresponds to a term in the generating function.

If the sequence is a1, a2, ..., am, then the generating function is (1 + x^{a1}) * (1 + x^{a2}) * ... * (1 + x^{am}).

I need this generating function to have coefficients of x^v for v from 1 to n, v != k, to be at least 1, and the coefficient for x^k to be 0.

This seems complex to handle directly, especially since m can be up to 25 and n can be up to 10^6.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the standard binary sequence again: [1, 2, 4, 8, ...].

With m elements, I can cover sums up to 2^m - 1.

Given that m <= 25, 2^25 - 1 is over 33 million, which is way larger than n can be (n <= 10^6), so it's sufficient in terms of sum coverage.

But I need to exclude k.

One approach is to include all powers of 2 up to n, but then adjust the sequence to block k.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can replace one of the standard binary numbers with a number that fills in another sum, but blocks k.

Alternatively, I can think about the binary representation of k and see which bits are set.

Suppose k has certain bits set in its binary representation.

To prevent any subset from summing to k, I need to ensure that no combination of the sequence elements can add up to k.

But if I have the standard binary sequence, there's exactly one way to sum to any number, including k.

So, to prevent summing to k, I need to modify the sequence so that there's no subset that sums to k.

One way to do this is to remove one of the elements that is necessary for forming k and add another element that helps cover the other sums.

But this needs to be done carefully.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=2, k=2.

From the sample input, the output is:

1

1

So, sequence [1].

Check the conditions:

- No subsequence sums to 2: empty subsequence sums to 0, [1] sums to 1. So, no sum of 2.

- For v=1 (since v=2 is k), there is a subsequence [1] that sums to 1.

Perfect.

Another sample:

n=6, k=1

Output:

5

2 3 4 5 6

Check:

- No subsequence sums to 1: all elements are >=2, so no subset can sum to 1.

- For v=2 to 6, v!=1, there are subsets that sum to each v.

Yes, seems correct.

Another sample:

n=8, k=8

Output:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Here, all elements are 1.

- No subsequence sums to 8: the sum of all 7 ones is 7, which is less than 8, so no subset sums to 8.

- For v=1 to 7, there are subsets that sum to each v.

Yes.

Another sample:

n=9, k=3

Output:

4

7 1 4 1

Check:

- Subsets:

[]:0

[7]:7

[1]:1

[4]:4

[7,1]:8

[7,4]:11

[1,4]:5

[7,1,4]:12

[7,1,1]:8 or 9? Wait, there are two 1's.

Wait, the sequence is 7,1,4,1.

So, possible subsets:

[]:0

[7]:7

[1]:1

[4]:4

[1]:1

[7,1]:8

[7,4]:11

[7,1]:8

[7,4,1]:12

[7,4,1]:12

[7,1,1]:8 or 9 (if the two 1's are included)

Wait, but in subsequences, since order is preserved, [1,1] sums to 2.

So, [7,1,1]:9

[4,1,1]:6

[7,1,4,1]:13

So, sums: 0,1,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13.

No sum of 3.

And all other v from 1 to 9 except 3 are present.

Yes.

Another sample:

n=10, k=7

Output:

4

1 2 8 3

Check:

Subsets:

[]:0

[1]:1

[2]:2

[8]:8

[3]:3

[1,2]:3

[1,8]:9

[1,3]:4

[2,8]:10

[2,3]:5

[8,3]:11

[1,2,8]:11

[1,2,3]:6

[1,8,3]:12

[2,8,3]:13

[1,2,8,3]:14

Sums: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

Missing sums: 7.

Perfect.

So, from these samples, I can see that there are different ways to construct the sequence.

In the first sample, a single element suffices.

In the second, five elements.

In the third, seven elements.

In the fourth and fifth, four elements.

So, the sequence length can vary, but it's always at most 25.

Now, I need a general approach to construct such a sequence for any n and k within the constraints.

Let me think about the properties required.

First, the sequence should not allow any subset to sum to k.

Second, for every v from 1 to n, except k, there should be at least one subset that sums to v.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and the sequence can have at most 25 elements, I need an efficient way to cover the sums.

I recall that with a set of 25 elements, if they are powers of 2, I can cover sums up to 2^25 - 1, which is more than enough for n up to 10^6.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can start with the standard binary sequence and make adjustments to block k.

Wait, but in the sample input where n=6 and k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which isn't a binary sequence.

In another sample, n=8 and k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is all 1's.

In n=9 and k=3, it's [7,1,4,1], and in n=10 and k=7, it's [1,2,8,3].

So, different strategies are used in different cases.

I need to find a general method that works for any n and k.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If k == 1:

Since no subset should sum to 1, and all subsets should sum to v from 2 to n, I can start with a sequence that has no 1's in it.

For example, if n=2 and k=2, then [1] is acceptable because no subset sums to 2.

Wait, but in this case, [2] would also work, since no subset sums to 2, and there's a subset that sums to 1.

Wait, but [2] doesn't have a subset that sums to 1.

Wait, actually, the empty subset sums to 0, [2] sums to 2.

So, to have a subset that sums to 1, I need to include 1 in the sequence.

But in the sample input where n=2 and k=2, the output is [1], which has a subset [1] summing to 1, and no subset summing to 2.

So, in this case, it's acceptable.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, [2] wouldn't work because there's no subset that sums to 1.

Hence, [1] is necessary.

Wait, but in n=6 and k=1, the output is [2,3,4,5,6], which doesn't include 1, and it's okay because k=1 is excluded.

Wait, in that case, v=1 is excluded, so it's okay not to have a subset summing to 1.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, for all v from 1 to n where v != k, there should be a subsequence that sums to v.

So, in the case where k=1, it's okay not to have a subset summing to 1.

Hence, in that sample, [2,3,4,5,6] works because:

- No subset sums to 1.

- Subsets can sum to 2,3,4,5,6.

Similarly, in n=8 and k=8, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] sums to sums from 0 to 7, excluding 8.

So, the approach seems to be:

- If k == 1, then exclude 1 from the sequence and include numbers that cover sums from 2 to n.

- If k > 1, then include numbers that cover sums from 1 to n except k.

But how to efficiently cover the sums except k?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then I modify it to exclude the sum k.

How can I do that?

One way is to remove an element that is necessary for forming k.

But that might affect other sums as well.

Alternatively, I can include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed.

Let me consider the standard binary sequence again.

If I take the binary sequence up to the required sum, say [1,2,4,8,...], I can form any sum uniquely.

To prevent forming k, I can remove the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me try with an example.

Suppose n=10, k=7.

Binary representation of 7 is 111, which is 4 + 2 + 1.

If I remove, say, 4 from the sequence [1,2,4,8], then I cannot form 7, because 7 = 4 + 2 + 1, and 4 is removed.

But then, I need to ensure that all other sums can still be formed.

But removing 4 would affect other sums as well.

For example, 6 = 4 + 2, but 4 is removed, so 6 cannot be formed anymore.

Hence, this approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: include elements such that their sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

One way to do this is to include elements that allow forming all sums except k.

But it's not straightforward.

Looking back at the sample inputs, in n=6 and k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which doesn't include 1, and hence no subset sums to 1, and all other sums from 2 to 6 can be formed.

In n=8 and k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can form sums from 0 to 7.

In n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can form sums except 3.

In n=10 and k=7, the sequence is [1,2,8,3], which can form sums except 7.

So, perhaps there is a pattern here.

Wait, in the case where k=1, excluding 1 is sufficient to not have any subset sum to 1, and still cover all other sums.

In other cases, where k >1, I need to ensure that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can be.

One possible approach is to include elements that cover all sums up to n, and then adjust the sequence to make sure that k cannot be formed.

But how?

Another idea: use the fact that with a set of numbers, the number of possible subset sums is 2^m, where m is the number of elements.

But since m can be up to 25, 2^25 is over 33 million, which is way larger than n can be.

But I need to cover only up to n, which is up to 1 million.

Wait, but the sums can be up to the sum of the sequence elements.

I need to make sure that the sequence can cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a minimal set of numbers that can cover all sums from 1 to n.

- Adjust the set to exclude the sum k.

How to cover all sums from 1 to n with a small number of elements?

One efficient way is to use the greedy algorithm: start with the smallest number, 1, then add the smallest number that allows you to cover new sums.

For example, start with [1], which covers sums up to 1.

Then add 2, covering up to 3.

Then add 4, covering up to 7.

Then add 8, covering up to 15, and so on.

This is the binary sequence again.

But as we've seen, in this problem, I need to exclude k.

So, perhaps I can modify this sequence by replacing one of the elements or adding an extra element to block k.

Wait, maybe I can exclude the element that is necessary to form k.

For example, if k=7 and the binary sequence is [1,2,4], which can form 7 as 1+2+4.

If I remove 4, then 7 cannot be formed, but other sums may be affected.

As we saw earlier, removing 4 affects other sums like 6=4+2.

So, this isn't ideal.

Another idea: include elements that cover all sums up to n except k.

I can think of it as covering the set {1,2,...,n} \ {k} with subset sums.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 0 to s, where s >= n.

Then, to exclude k, I need to ensure that k is not in the set of achievable sums.

But how?

One way is to have the set of achievable sums be {0,1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

This seems specific.

Perhaps I can look for a sequence where the subset sums cover all numbers up to n except k.

This sounds similar to the concept of a minimal additive basis, but excluding one specific sum.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If k == 1, then exclude 1 from the sequence and include numbers that can cover sums from 2 to n.

- If k >1, include numbers that can cover sums from 1 to n except k.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

For n=2, k=2: sequence [1]

- Sums: 0,1

- No sum of 2

For n=6, k=1: sequence [2,3,4,5,6]

- Sums: 0,2,3,4,5,6, etc.

- No sum of 1

For n=8, k=8: sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- Sums: 0 to 7

- No sum of 8

For n=9, k=3: sequence [7,1,4,1]

- Sums: 0,1,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13, etc.

- No sum of 3

For n=10, k=7: sequence [1,2,8,3]

- Sums: 0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11, etc.

- No sum of 7

So, in some cases, repeating elements is allowed, as seen in [1,1,1,1,1,1,1].

But the problem says "a sequence of non-negative integers", which allows duplicates.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the elements are non-negative integers, and in the sample inputs, they are positive integers.

But technically, zero is allowed.

However, including zero in the sequence would only add a sum of zero, which doesn't help in forming other sums.

So, it's probably better to avoid zeros.

Now, considering that duplicates are allowed, I can have multiple instances of the same number.

This gives more flexibility in forming sums.

For example, in [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], I can form sums from 0 to 7 by choosing different numbers.

Similarly, in [7,1,4,1], I can form various sums.

So, perhaps I can include multiple ones to increase the flexibility in forming sums.

Wait, but including multiple ones is similar to having a certain number of ones that can be chosen to adjust the sum.

This seems like a way to fine-tune the sums.

Let me think about this.

Suppose I have a base sequence that can cover all sums except k, and then I add additional elements to cover the remaining sums.

But it's still vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a base sequence that can cover all sums from 1 to n.

- Then, adjust the sequence to exclude the sum k.

How to adjust it?

One way is to remove an element that is necessary for forming k, and then add other elements to cover the sums that were affected by the removal.

But this seems too vague and not practical.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 0 to s, where s >= n, except k.

I need to ensure that k is not achievable, but all other v from 1 to n (except k) are achievable.

One way to ensure that k is not achievable is to make sure that no combination of the sequence elements sums to k.

But ensuring that all other v are achievable is tricky.

Let me consider the following plan:

- If k == 1, then exclude 1 from the sequence and include numbers that can cover sums from 2 to n.

- If k >1, include numbers that can cover sums from 1 to n except k.

But I need a more concrete way to do this.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of generating functions or inclusion-exclusion.

But that might be too slow for n up to 10^6.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that with m elements, I can cover up to 2^m -1 sums.

With m=25, that's over 33 million, which is way more than n=10^6.

So, I need to use the elements efficiently.

Let me consider that the sequence elements are chosen such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

I need to maximize the coverage with minimal elements.

Wait, but m is at most 25, so I need to choose elements carefully.

Let me think about the following approach:

- Start with the standard binary sequence: [1,2,4,8,16,...].

- This can cover all sums uniquely up to 2^m -1.

- To exclude k, I can remove the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

- However, as I saw earlier, this might affect other sums as well.

- So, perhaps I need to adjust by adding other elements to cover the sums that are no longer possible due to the removal.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think of another way.

Suppose I take the standard binary sequence up to the required sum, and then adjust it by replacing one of the elements.

For example, if k=7 and the binary sequence is [1,2,4], which sums to 7.

If I replace 4 with 5, then the sequence becomes [1,2,5], which can sum to 1,2,3,5,6,7,8.

Wait, but I still can sum to 7.

So, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if I replace 4 with 6, then the sequence is [1,2,6], which can sum to 1,2,3,6,7,8,9].

Still, 7 is present.

Hmm.

Alternatively, if I include elements that sum to all v except k.

Wait, maybe I can include elements that cover all v from 1 to n except k by carefully choosing them.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the sequence should have subset sums that cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Given that m <=25, and n <=10^6, I need an efficient way to cover the sums.

Perhaps I can use a combination of large elements and small elements to cover the sums efficiently.

Wait, maybe I can include a large element that covers higher sums and include smaller elements to cover lower sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But this is still not concrete.

Let me consider that if I include k itself in the sequence, then there is a subset that sums to k, which violates the condition.

So, I need to ensure that k is not included in the sequence.

But that's not sufficient, because subsets can sum to k even without including k itself.

Wait, in the sample input where n=10 and k=7, the sequence is [1,2,8,3], which includes neither 7 nor any combination that sums to 7.

But 1+2+3=6, 1+2+8=11, etc.

Wait, but 1+2+3+1=7, but in this sequence, there is only one '1'.

Wait, in the sequence [7,1,4,1], which is for n=9 and k=3, there are two '1's, which can sum to 2, but not to 3.

Wait, but in the sequence [1,2,8,3], for n=10 and k=7, sums are 0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11, etc., missing 7.

So, perhaps including elements that don't allow the sum k to be formed.

But I need a general approach.

Let me think about the following plan:

- If k ==1, then exclude 1 from the sequence and include elements that can cover sums from 2 to n.

- If k >1, include elements that can cover sums from 1 to n except k.

But I need a systematic way to choose these elements.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the sequence elements should not allow the sum k to be formed, but allow all other sums.

This seems too abstract.

Let me consider that the sequence should include elements such that the subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through possible elements and check if including them helps cover more sums without allowing k to be formed.

But this seems too time-consuming.

Let me consider that with m=25 elements, I can cover a large number of sums.

So, perhaps I can include elements that cover all sums up to n except k.

But I need a smarter way to do this.

Let me consider that if I have a sequence that covers all sums up to n, and then remove the subset that sums to k, if possible.

But removing a subset doesn't make sense in this context.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed.

But I need a concrete plan.

Let me consider that if I have a sequence where the subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k, then I need to ensure that:

- For each v !=k, there exists at least one subset that sums to v.

- There is no subset that sums to k.

Given that, I need to choose the sequence elements carefully.

This seems too broad.

Let me think about the following approach:

- Start with an empty sequence.

- Iteratively add elements that allow covering as many v as possible without allowing the sum k to be formed.

This sounds like a greedy algorithm.

But I need to define the criteria for adding elements.

Wait, perhaps I can add elements that cover the maximum number of uncovered v's without allowing k to be formed.

But this seems too slow for n up to 10^6.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that if I have a sequence where the subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k, then the number of subset sums is 2^m -1 (excluding the empty subset), minus the subsets that sum to k.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the inclusion of elements that block the sum k.

But I'm going in circles.

Let me look at the constraints again.

Given that t can be up to 1000 and the sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^7, I need an efficient solution, both in terms of time and space.

I need to find a way to construct the sequence in a way that is efficient and general.

Looking back at the sample inputs, in some cases, sequences with repeated elements are used, like [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] for n=8 and k=8.

In other cases, sequences with distinct elements are used.

So, duplicates are allowed and can be useful.

Wait, perhaps including multiple ones can help in fine-tuning the sums.

For example, in [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], I can form sums from 0 to 7 by choosing different numbers of ones.

Similarly, in [7,1,4,1], I can form sums like 1,4,5,7,8,9, etc.

So, including multiple ones allows me to adjust the sums by adding different numbers of ones to other elements.

This seems promising.

Let me consider that including multiple ones allows me to cover a range of sums around the other elements.

For example, with [7,1,4,1], I can form sums like:

- 0

- 1 (from one 1)

- 1+1=2

- 4

- 4+1=5

- 4+1+1=6

- 7

- 7+1=8

- 7+1+1=9

- 7+4=11

- 7+4+1=12

- 7+4+1+1=13

- etc.

So, by including multiple ones, I can cover sums that are the main element plus the number of ones I include.

This allows me to cover a range of sums with each main element.

Now, to exclude k, I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

Given that, perhaps I can choose elements such that k cannot be formed, but all other v can be formed by adjusting the number of ones.

Wait, perhaps I can include a large element that covers higher sums and include ones to cover the lower sums.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Let me consider that if I include a large element, say n, then I can cover sums from n down to n minus the sum of the other elements.

But I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if I include elements that are greater than k, and adjust the ones to cover the sums below k, except k.

But this is still too vague.

Let me think about the following approach:

- If k ==1, then exclude 1 from the sequence and include elements that can cover sums from 2 to n.

- For k >1, include elements that can cover sums from 1 to n except k.

But I need a systematic way to choose these elements.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that are just above k, and include ones to adjust the sums.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Let me consider that if I include elements that are greater than k, and include ones to cover the sums below k, except k.

Wait, for example, if k=3, n=9, include elements like 4,7 and ones to cover sums from 1 to 2 and from 4 to 9, except 3.

But in the sample input, for n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can cover sums like 1,4,5,7,8,9, etc., missing 3.

But in this sequence, 1+1+1=3, but in the sequence [7,1,4,1], there are only two ones, so 1+1=2, but not three ones.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Looking back, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which has two ones.

So, possible sums are:

- 0

- 1

- 1

- 4

- 7

- 1+1=2

- 1+4=5

- 1+7=8

- 1+7=8

- 1+4=5

- 1+4=5

- 7+1=8

- 7+4=11

- 7+1=8

- 4+1=5

- 7+4+1=12

- 7+1+1=9

- 4+1+1=6

So, sums are 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12.

Missing sums: 3,10.

Wait, but in the sample input, n=9 and k=3, so I need to ensure that no subset sums to 3, and all other v from 1 to 9 except 3 are possible.

In this sequence, sums include 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9, which covers all v from 1 to 9 except 3.

So, how was this sequence constructed?

It seems that by including 7,1,4,1, I can cover the required sums except 3.

But how to generalize this?

Let me consider that including a large element like 7 allows me to cover higher sums, and including ones and other elements to cover lower sums, while ensuring that the sum 3 cannot be formed.

In this case, since there are only two ones, the possible sums involving ones are 1,1, and 1+1=2.

So, sums up to 2 can be formed with ones, and higher sums can be formed by adding the larger elements.

Hence, sums like 4 (from 4), 5 (from 4+1), 6 (from 4+1+1), 7 (from 7), 8 (from 7+1), 9 (from 7+1+1).

And 3 is not achievable because I don't have three ones.

So, by limiting the number of ones, I can prevent certain sums from being formed.

This seems like a useful strategy.

Hence, a general approach could be:

- Determine how many ones to include to cover sums from 1 up to a certain value, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

- Include larger elements to cover higher sums.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me think about the number of ones to include.

Suppose I include t ones.

Then, I can form sums from 0 to t using only the ones.

If t >= k, then I can form the sum k using k ones, which I don't want.

Hence, to prevent forming k, I need to have t < k.

But then, I can only form sums from 0 to t, where t < k.

Hence, I can cover sums from 0 to k-1, but not k.

But I need to cover all v from 1 to n except k.

So, for v from k+1 to n, I need to include elements that can cover these sums.

Wait, but with t ones, I can cover sums from 0 to t.

To cover higher sums, I need to include larger elements.

For example, include elements like k+1, k+2, etc.

But this might not be efficient.

Let me consider that if I set t = k-1, then I can form sums from 0 to k-1 using the ones.

Hence, I can cover all sums from 0 to k-1.

Now, to cover sums from k+1 to n, I need to include elements that, when added to the sums formed by the ones, can cover k+1 to n.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Given that, perhaps I can include elements that are greater than or equal to k+1.

Hence, the sequence would consist of:

- t = k-1 ones, which allow forming sums from 0 to k-1.

- Additional elements that are >= k+1, to cover sums from k+1 to n.

This way, since the smallest sum I can form with the larger elements is k+1, and the ones can only form sums up to k-1, the sum k cannot be formed.

Moreover, by combining the ones with the larger elements, I can cover sums from k+1 to n.

Wait, but I need to cover sums from 1 to n except k.

With t = k-1 ones, I can form sums from 0 to k-1.

Then, by including larger elements starting from k+1, I can form sums from k+1 to n.

But what about sums between k and k+1?

Wait, k is missing, which is what I want.

For example, if k=3, then t=2 ones, which can form 0,1,2.

Include larger elements like 4,5, etc., which can form sums like 4,5, etc.

Hence, sums are 0,1,2,4,5,6,... up to n, excluding 3.

This seems promising.

But I need to ensure that all v from 1 to n except k can be formed.

In this approach, with t = k-1 ones and larger elements starting from k+1, I can form sums from 0 to k-1 plus the larger elements.

But can I cover all sums from 1 to n except k?

Wait, suppose n=10 and k=3.

Then, t=2 ones, and include elements like 4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Then, sums are:

- 0

- 1

- 2

- 4

- 5

- 6

- ...

- up to 10

But what about sums like 5=2+3, but 3 cannot be formed.

Wait, no, 3 cannot be formed.

Hence, sums like 4,5,6,... can be formed by adding the larger elements to the ones.

Wait, for example, 5 can be formed as 4 +1, or 5 +0.

But in this case, if I have 4 and 1, I can form 4,5.

Similarly, with 5 and 1, I can form 5,6.

But in this setup, I need to ensure that all v from 1 to n except k can be formed.

Wait, in this approach, with t=k-1 ones and larger elements starting from k+1, I can form sums from 0 to k-1 plus any of the larger elements.

But I need to ensure that all sums from 1 to n except k are achievable.

Let me see with an example.

Take n=6, k=1.

Then, t=0 ones (since k-1=0), and include elements starting from 2 to 6.

Hence, sequence [2,3,4,5,6], which matches the sample input.

Sums: 0,2,3,4,5,6.

No sum of 1.

Perfect.

Another sample: n=8, k=8.

Then, t=7 ones.

But in the sample input, it's [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is t=7 ones.

Sums: 0 to 7.

No sum of 8.

Perfect.

Another sample: n=9, k=3.

Then, t=2 ones.

Include larger elements starting from 4 up to 9.

For example, sequence [4,5,6,7,8,9], plus 2 ones.

But in the sample input, it's [7,1,4,1], which has two ones and two larger elements.

Wait, but according to my current approach, I would include t=2 ones and larger elements from 4 to 9.

But in the sample, they have [7,1,4,1], which is two ones, 4, and 7.

This seems to be a more optimized sequence.

Hence, perhaps including a few larger elements can cover a wider range of sums.

So, perhaps instead of including all elements from k+1 to n, I can include a smaller set of elements that, combined with the ones, can cover all sums from 1 to n except k.

This would be more efficient and help keep the sequence length small.

Given that m <=25, I need to keep the sequence as short as possible.

Hence, including many elements from k+1 to n is not efficient.

Instead, I should include a minimal set of larger elements that, when combined with the ones, can cover all required sums.

Let me think about how to choose these larger elements.

Suppose I have t ones, which cover sums from 0 to t.

Then, by including a larger element x, I can cover sums from x to x+t.

Hence, to cover sums from k+1 to n, I need to choose elements x1, x2, ..., xm such that the union of [x1, x1+t], [x2, x2+t], ..., [xm, xm+t] covers [k+1, n].

Moreover, I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Given that t = k-1, since with t ones, I can form sums up to t = k-1.

Hence, the larger elements should start from k+1.

Now, to minimize the number of larger elements, I can choose them in such a way that their coverage overlaps efficiently.

For example, if I choose x1 = k+1, then it covers sums from k+1 to k+1 + t.

Then, choose x2 = k+1 + t +1, and so on.

This way, I can cover the range [k+1, n] with as few larger elements as possible.

This seems similar to the concept of covering a range with intervals of length
