Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, there are n integers in a sequence, each not exceeding 4, meaning they can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. After each game, Eve removes one number from the sequence, and they play again with the remaining numbers, until there are no numbers left.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins. I need to figure out, given the initial counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, how many times Bob can win if Eve plays optimally.

First, I need to understand the XOR operation. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order of operations doesn't matter. So, the XOR of a sequence is just the cumulative XOR of all its elements.

Bob wins when the XOR of the current sequence is zero. Otherwise, Alice wins. Eve can choose which number to remove at each step, and she wants to maximize Bob's wins.

Given that the numbers are only up to 4, and we have counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, I need to think about how these numbers affect the XOR.

Let me list out the XOR values for these numbers:

- 0 XOR anything is anything.

- 1 XOR 1 is 0.

- 2 in binary is 10, 3 is 11, 4 is 100.

But wait, the problem says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4," but in the example, they have p_i representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours. So, does that mean zeros are not present? Wait, in the problem statement, it says "each integer in the sequence doesn't exceed 4," which includes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. But in the input description, it says "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game." So, it seems zeros are not explicitly counted, or perhaps they are handled differently.

Wait, in the first test case, input is "1 1 1 0", which likely means 1 one, 1 two, 1 three, and 0 fours. So, the sequence is [1, 2, 3]. Similarly, in the second test case, "1 0 1 2" means 1 one, 0 twos, 1 three, and 2 fours, so the sequence is [1, 3, 4, 4].

Wait, but if the sequence can contain zeros, why isn't there a count for zeros? Maybe the problem assumes that zeros are not present, or perhaps zeros don't affect the XOR since XOR with zero is unchanged.

Wait, but if zeros are present, they should be considered because XOR with zero doesn't change the value. So, if there are zeros in the sequence, the XOR would be the same as the XOR of the non-zero elements.

But according to the input description, we have counts for ones, twos, threes, and fours only. So, perhaps zeros are not present in the sequence, or they are not explicitly counted.

Looking back at the problem statement: "each integer in the sequence doesn't exceed 4." So, the integers can be 0,1,2,3,4. But in the input, we have counts for ones, twos, threes, and fours only. So, maybe zeros are included in the sequence, but their count isn't provided explicitly.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If zeros are present, their count should be provided, or perhaps they are included in the counts.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says: "the first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game."

So, p0 is the number of ones, p1 is the number of twos, p2 is the number of threes, and p3 is the number of fours.

Wait, no. In programming, indices usually start at 0, but in problem statements, p_i often refers to the count of that integer. But here, it says "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours."

So, p0 is the count of ones, p1 is the count of twos, p2 is the count of threes, and p3 is the count of fours.

Wait, but in Python, indices start at 0, so p[0] would be the count of ones, p[1] the count of twos, etc.

But in the example input, "1 1 1 0" likely means one '1', one '2', one '3', and zero '4's.

Wait, but in programming terms, if p[0] is the count of ones, p[1] is the count of twos, etc., then in Python, p[0] would be the count of ones.

But in the example, "1 1 1 0" corresponds to [1, 1, 1, 0], which means one '1', one '2', one '3', and zero '4's.

So, the sequence is [1,2,3].

Now, I need to find out how many times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

First, let's understand the XOR of the sequence.

The XOR of [1,2,3] is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3.

Let's compute that: 1 XOR 2 is 3, and 3 XOR 3 is 0. So, XOR is 0, so Bob wins initially.

Then, Eve removes one number. Let's say she removes '1'. Now the sequence is [2,3], XOR is 2 XOR 3 = 1. So, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, say '2', sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Finally, remove '3', sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins twice.

But in the first example, it says Bob wins only once.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, the sequence starts with [1,2,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Eve removes one number, say '1', sequence is [2,3], XOR is 1, Alice wins.

Eve removes '2', sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Eve removes '3', sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins two times, but the sample output is 1.

Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the game is played with n numbers, then n-1, and so on, but the sequence reduces by one each time.

In the first game, with [1,2,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say '1', sequence is [2,3], XOR is 1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes '2', sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes '3', sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins two times, but sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game.

Wait, in the problem statement: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, games are played with n numbers, n-1, ..., down to 0 numbers.

So, including the empty sequence.

In the empty sequence, XOR is 0, which is Bob's win.

So, in this case, Bob wins two times.

But the sample output for the first test case is 1.

Hmm, perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game.

Let's check the problem statement again: "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n-2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems that the empty sequence is also considered a game, where Bob wins.

But in the first sample input, with [1,2,3], Bob wins twice, but the output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, maybe the order of removal affects the number of Bob's wins.

Let's try different removals.

Start with [1,2,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Eve removes '2', sequence is [1,3], XOR is 1 XOR 3 = 2, Alice wins.

Eve removes '1', sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Eve removes '3', sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Again, two Bob wins.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, maybe the empty sequence is not considered a game.

Looking back at the problem statement: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems that the empty sequence is also a game where Bob wins.

But in the sample input, output is 1, but according to my calculation, it should be 2.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't count the empty sequence as a game.

Let's check the note: "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

So, initially, with [1,2,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say '1', sequence is [2,3], XOR is 1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes '2', sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes '3', sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

But according to the note, Bob wins only once, which is the initial game.

Maybe the empty sequence is not considered a game.

Looking back at the problem statement: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

But it says "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n-2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems that the empty sequence is also a game.

But in the note, it says Bob wins only once, which is the initial game.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me look at the second sample input: "1 0 1 2", which is [1,3,4,4], XOR is 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 3 = 2, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number. To maximize Bob's wins, she should try to make the XOR zero.

Let's see:

Remove '1': sequence [3,4,4], XOR is 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 3 XOR 0 = 3, Alice wins.

Remove '3': sequence [1,4,4], XOR is 1 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 0 = 1, Alice wins.

Remove '4': sequence [1,3,4], XOR is 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 6, which is non-zero, Alice wins.

Remove '4': sequence [1,3,4], same as above.

So, no matter which number Eve removes, Alice wins the next game.

Then, Eve removes another number, and so on.

Wait, in this case, Bob only wins once, which is the initial game.

Wait, but in this case, the initial XOR is 2, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

Wait, no, wait: 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 3 = 2, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

So, Bob doesn't win the initial game.

Wait, maybe I need to re-express.

Wait, in the second test case, input is "1 0 1 2", which is [1,3,4,4].

XOR is 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 3 = 2, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number.

She can remove '1': sequence [3,4,4], XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 3 XOR 0 = 3, Alice wins.

Remove '3': sequence [1,4,4], XOR 1 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 0 = 1, Alice wins.

Remove '4': sequence [1,3,4], XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 6, Alice wins.

Remove '4': sequence [1,3,4], same as above.

So, no matter what Eve removes, Alice wins the next game.

Then, Eve removes another number.

Suppose sequence is [3,4,4], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Eve removes '3': sequence [4,4], XOR 0, Bob wins.

So, in this path, Bob wins once in the initial game (which was Alice's win), and once when sequence is [4,4], XOR is 0.

Wait, but initial XOR was 2, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes '1', sequence [3,4,4], XOR 3, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes '3', sequence [4,4], XOR 0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes '4', sequence [4], XOR 4, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes '4', sequence empty, XOR 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice in this path.

But the sample output for the second test case is 1.

Hmm, perhaps I need to choose the removals carefully to maximize Bob's wins.

Let's try another removal path.

Initial sequence [1,3,4,4], XOR 2, Alice wins.

Eve removes '4', sequence [1,3,4], XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 6, Alice wins.

Eve removes '4', sequence [1,3], XOR 1 XOR 3 = 2, Alice wins.

Eve removes '3', sequence [1], XOR 1, Alice wins.

Eve removes '1', sequence empty, XOR 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins only once in this path.

Wait, in the previous path, Bob won twice, but according to the sample output, it should be 1.

So, perhaps some games are not counted.

Looking back at the problem statement: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, games are played with n, n-1, n-2, ..., 0 numbers.

But in the first test case, with n=3, games are played with 3,2,1,0 numbers.

In the first path I chose, Bob wins with 3 numbers and with 0 numbers.

But according to the sample output, it's only 1.

Perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game.

Looking back at the problem statement: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems that the empty sequence is also a game.

But in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

So, with n=3, Bob wins once.

But in my earlier path, Bob wins twice.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Eve can't choose to remove a number that would lead to multiple Bob wins.

Wait, no, Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins.

So, she would choose the removals that lead to as many Bob wins as possible.

In the first test case, with [1,2,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes '2', sequence [1,3], XOR 1 XOR 3 = 2, Alice wins.

Then, removes '1', sequence [3], XOR 3, Alice wins.

Then, removes '3', sequence empty, XOR 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't count the empty sequence as a game.

Looking back at the problem statement: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

But it says "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n-2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems that the empty sequence is also a game.

But in the sample output, it's 1.

Perhaps the problem doesn't consider the empty sequence as a game.

Looking at the third test case: "2 2 2 0", which is [1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one '1', sequence [1,2,2,3,3], XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

Then, removes '1', sequence [2,2,3,3], XOR 0, Bob wins.

Then, removes '2', sequence [2,3,3], XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 2, Alice wins.

Then, removes '2', sequence [3,3], XOR 0, Bob wins.

Then, removes '3', sequence [3], XOR 3, Alice wins.

Then, removes '3', sequence empty, XOR 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins four times.

But the sample output is 3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't count the empty sequence as a game.

In this path, Bob wins with n=6, n=4, n=3, n=2, n=1, n=0.

But perhaps n=0 is not counted.

If we exclude the empty sequence, Bob wins three times.

Which matches the sample output of 3.

So, perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game.

Therefore, in the first test case, Bob wins only once (with n=3), and the empty sequence is not counted.

But in the first test case, with n=3, games are played with n=3, n=2, n=1, n=0.

Excluding n=0, Bob wins once.

In the second test case, n=4, games with n=4, n=3, n=2, n=1, n=0.

Excluding n=0, Bob wins once.

In the third test case, n=6, games with n=6, n=5, n=4, n=3, n=2, n=1, n=0.

Excluding n=0, Bob wins three times.

So, now I need to find a way to maximize the number of times Bob wins, excluding the empty sequence.

So, the task is to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero, excluding the empty sequence.

Wait, but in the third test case, with n=6, sequence [1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one '1', sequence [1,2,2,3,3], XOR 1, Alice wins.

Then, removes '1', sequence [2,2,3,3], XOR 0, Bob wins.

Then, removes '2', sequence [2,3,3], XOR 2, Alice wins.

Then, removes '2', sequence [3,3], XOR 0, Bob wins.

Then, removes '3', sequence [3], XOR 3, Alice wins.

Excluding the empty sequence, Bob wins three times.

So, the maximum number of Bob's wins is three.

Now, I need to generalize this for any given counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.

I need to find the maximum number of times Bob can win, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero, excluding the empty sequence, with optimal removals by Eve.

To maximize Bob's wins, Eve needs to choose which number to remove in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.

This seems tricky because the XOR depends on the combination of numbers removed.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider the XOR of the entire sequence initially.

If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins the first game.

Otherwise, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, and we have a new XOR.

Eve wants to choose the number to remove in such a way that the new XOR is zero if possible.

If not, she removes a number that leads to the maximum number of future Bob's wins.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where at each step, we choose which number to remove to maximize the number of times the XOR becomes zero.

But with n up to 200*4=800, and t up to 10^4, this approach is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the properties of XOR.

XOR is associative and commutative.

The XOR of a sequence is just the cumulative XOR of all its elements.

I need to find subsets of the sequence where the XOR is zero.

Wait, but it's not about subsets; it's about the sequence after removing some numbers.

Wait, more precisely, it's about the sequence after removing k numbers, for k from 0 to n-1.

But it's not about all possible subsets; it's about a specific sequence of removals by Eve.

But Eve removes one number at a time, and chooses which one to remove to maximize Bob's wins.

This seems complex.

Maybe there's a better way to look at it.

Let me consider the XOR of the entire sequence.

Suppose the initial XOR is X.

If X is zero, Bob wins the first game.

Otherwise, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say Y, and the new XOR is X XOR Y.

Eve wants to choose Y such that X XOR Y is zero, if possible.

If X XOR Y is zero, then Y must be equal to X.

So, if X is present in the sequence, Eve can remove X, making the XOR zero for the next game.

But in our problem, the numbers are only 1,2,3,4.

So, X can be 0,1,2,3,4, or other values depending on the XOR.

Wait, but X is the XOR of some combination of 1,2,3,4.

Let me see what possible XOR values can be obtained.

Given that the numbers are small, and there are only four distinct numbers, perhaps I can precompute or find a pattern in the XOR values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the counts of each number.

Wait, perhaps representing the counts in terms of their parity can help.

Wait, but the numbers are small, so maybe I can think in terms of the XOR properties.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the sequence as a vector of their binary representations and compute the XOR.

But that might not lead me directly to the solution.

Let me consider that the XOR of the sequence is the bitwise XOR of all elements.

I need to find how many times, by removing one number at a time, the XOR becomes zero.

Wait, but it's not just removing one number, it's removing one number each time, sequentially, and at each step, computing the XOR of the remaining sequence.

This seems too involved.

Maybe I need to find a pattern or a formula based on the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.

Let me look at the sample inputs and outputs.

First sample input: 1 1 1 0, which is [1,2,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Then, remove one number, say '1', sequence [2,3], XOR 1, Alice wins.

Remove '2', sequence [3], XOR 3, Alice wins.

Remove '3', sequence empty, XOR 0, Bob wins.

Excluding the empty sequence, Bob wins once.

Second sample input: 1 0 1 2, which is [1,3,4,4], XOR is 2, Alice wins.

Then, remove '1', sequence [3,4,4], XOR 3, Alice wins.

Remove '3', sequence [4,4], XOR 0, Bob wins.

Remove '4', sequence [4], XOR 4, Alice wins.

Remove '4', sequence empty, XOR 0, Bob wins.

Excluding the empty sequence, Bob wins once.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, in the first sample, Bob wins once, and in the second sample, Bob wins once.

But in the first path I chose for the second sample, Bob could win twice, but perhaps it's not possible to have two Bob wins excluding the empty sequence.

Wait, perhaps in some removal sequences, Bob can win more times, but in others, less.

Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, so she chooses the removals that lead to the maximum number of Bob's wins.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the parity of the counts.

Let me consider that XOR is equivalent to addition modulo 2 in each bit.

But since the numbers are up to 4, which is 100 in binary, the XOR can be influenced by the counts of each bit.

Wait, perhaps I can look at each bit position separately.

Let's consider the binary representations:

- 0: 000

- 1: 001

- 2: 010

- 3: 011

- 4: 100

So, the XOR of the sequence is the bitwise XOR of these binary representations.

In terms of bit operations, the XOR of a sequence is the sum modulo 2 of the bits in each position.

So, for the three bit positions (since 4 is 100), we have:

- Least significant bit (LSB): contributions from 1,2,3,4.

- Middle bit: contributions from 2,3,4.

- Most significant bit (MSB): contribution only from 4.

So, for each bit position, the XOR is the sum modulo 2 of the counts of numbers that have that bit set.

For example:

- LSB: counts of numbers with LSB set, which are 1,2,3.

- Middle bit: counts of numbers with middle bit set, which are 2,3,4.

- MSB: counts of numbers with MSB set, which is only 4.

So, the XOR of the sequence can be determined by looking at the parity (even or odd) of the counts of numbers with each bit set.

Let me formalize this.

Let:

- c0 = count of numbers with bit 0 set (which are 1,2,3).

- c1 = count of numbers with bit 1 set (which are 2,3,4).

- c2 = count of numbers with bit 2 set (which is 4).

Then, the XOR of the sequence is:

- bit 0: c0 % 2

- bit 1: c1 % 2

- bit 2: c2 % 2

So, the XOR value X is (c2 % 2)*4 + (c1 % 2)*2 + (c0 % 2)*1.

Now, Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, the counts c0, c1, c2 change depending on which number is removed.

Each number removes its contributions to c0, c1, c2.

For example:

- Removing 1: decreases c0 by 1.

- Removing 2: decreases c0 and c1 by 1.

- Removing 3: decreases c0 and c1 by 1.

- Removing 4: decreases c1 and c2 by 1.

Wait, let's list the bit contributions for each number:

- 1: bit 0 set (c0 +=1)

- 2: bit 0 and bit 1 set (c0 +=1, c1 +=1)

- 3: bit 0 and bit 1 set (c0 +=1, c1 +=1)

- 4: bit 1 and bit 2 set (c1 +=1, c2 +=1)

Wait, but in terms of XOR, it's the sum modulo 2 of these contributions.

So, c0 is the total count of numbers with bit 0 set, modulo 2.

Similarly for c1 and c2.

Now, the XOR X is (c2 % 2)*4 + (c1 % 2)*2 + (c0 % 2)*1.

Eve wants to remove numbers in such a way that after removal, the new XOR is zero as often as possible.

So, she wants to choose which number to remove to make the new XOR zero.

Given that, she can choose to remove a number that flips the bits in such a way that the new XOR becomes zero.

Wait, but she removes one number at a time, and chooses which one to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the new XOR is zero.

This seems like a greedy approach.

At each step, if possible, Eve should remove a number that makes the new XOR zero.

If not, she should choose a number that leads to a state where in the future, the new XOR can be zero as often as possible.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the counts.

Let me consider that the XOR is zero when c0 % 2 == 0 and c1 % 2 == 0 and c2 % 2 == 0.

So, to make XOR zero, we need to have even counts of numbers that set each bit.

Now, Eve can remove one number at a time, which affects the counts c0, c1, c2 depending on which number she removes.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents the current state of c0, c1, c2 modulo 2, and edges represent removal of a number.

Then, Eve wants to traverse this graph to maximize the number of times
