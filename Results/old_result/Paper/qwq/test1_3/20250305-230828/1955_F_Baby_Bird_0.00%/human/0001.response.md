Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are n integers in a sequence, each of which is at most 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Then, Eve removes one number at a time, and they play again with the remaining numbers, and this continues until there are no numbers left. Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

First, I need to understand the XOR operation. XOR is a bitwise operation where the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For a sequence of numbers, the XOR is the bitwise XOR of all of them.

Given that each number is at most 4, the possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. But in the input, we are given the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4. Wait, does that mean there are no zeros in the sequence? Or is zero not considered since it's not listed?

Looking back at the problem, it says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4." So, the integers can be 0,1,2,3,4. But in the input, it's given as four integers p_i, which are the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. So, p0 is the count of ones, p1 is the count of twos, and so on. Wait, no, the problem says "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game." So, p0 is the count of ones, p1 is the count of twos, p2 is the count of threes, and p3 is the count of fours. What about zeros? If there are zeros in the sequence, how are they represented?

Wait, in the input description, it says "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game." So, if there are zeros in the sequence, they are not included in these counts. That means the count of zeros is n - (p0 + p1 + p2 + p3). But in the input, we only have p0, p1, p2, p3. So, I need to figure out how to handle zeros.

But actually, in the problem statement, it says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4." So, the integers can be 0,1,2,3,4. But in the input, we have counts for ones, twos, threes, and fours. So, zeros must be handled separately.

Wait, looking back, it says "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game." So, p0 is the count of ones, p1 is the count of twos, p2 is the count of threes, p3 is the count of fours. What about zeros? Are they included in the counts? The problem says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4," which includes zero. But in the input, only ones, twos, threes, and fours are counted. So, perhaps the count of zeros is not directly given, but can be inferred as n minus the sum of p0 to p3.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's just four integers per test case, representing p0 to p3. So, n = p0 + p1 + p2 + p3. So, the count of zeros is zero. Wait, no, the problem says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4," which includes zero. But in the input, only the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours are given. So, perhaps the count of zeros is not explicitly given, but it's part of the sequence.

Wait, looking back, the problem says "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game." So, it's p0 ones, p1 twos, p2 threes, p3 fours. What about zeros? If the sequence can contain zeros, then the count of zeros would be n - (p0 + p1 + p2 + p3). But in the input, only p0 to p3 are given, so perhaps n is p0 + p1 + p2 + p3, meaning no zeros are present.

Wait, in the sample input, it's just five test cases, each with four integers p0 to p3. In the first test case, 1 1 1 0, which means one 1, one 2, one 3, and zero 4's. So, the sequence is [1,2,3]. The output is 1, meaning Bob wins once.

Wait, but according to the problem, Eve removes one number at a time, and they play with the remaining numbers each time. So, for n=3, they play with 3 numbers, then 2 numbers, then 1 number, then 0.

In the first test case, with [1,2,3], XOR of all is 1^2^3 = 0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining [2,3], XOR is 2^3=1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 2, remaining [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Finally, remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Wait, but the output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

Wait, but in this scenario, Bob wins twice: with all three numbers and with the empty sequence.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the game is played only up to the point where one number is removed each time, so for n=3, they play with n=3, n=2, n=1, but not n=0.

Wait, no, the problem says "until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, in the first test case, with [1,2,3]:

- n=3: XOR(1,2,3)=0, Bob wins.

- Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence is [2,3]: XOR(2,3)=1, Alice wins.

- Eve removes another number, say 2, sequence is [3]: XOR(3)=3, Alice wins.

- Eve removes the last number, sequence is empty: XOR(0), Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice, but the output is 1. So, perhaps Bob wins only when the XOR is zero, and Alice wins when it's non-zero.

Wait, no, according to the problem, "Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins." So, when XOR is zero, Bob wins.

In the first test case:

- With n=3: XOR=0, Bob wins.

- n=2: XOR=1, Alice wins.

- n=1: XOR=3, Alice wins.

- n=0: XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice, but the output is 1. So, perhaps Bob wins only once.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game. The problem says "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers," and so on, "this continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems that the game is played for each sequence from n down to 0.

But in the first test case, Bob wins when n=3 and n=0, which is twice, but the output is 1.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence doesn't count as a game. So, maybe only up to n=1.

But in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

So, only when n=3, Bob wins, and in subsequent games, Alice wins, so Bob wins only once.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when n=0, Bob also wins, but maybe the empty sequence isn't considered a game.

Looking back at the problem, it says "this continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, perhaps the empty sequence is also considered a game.

But in the first test case, the output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

Wait, perhaps in the empty sequence, Bob doesn't win, or it's not counted.

I'm getting confused.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

5

1 1 1 0

1 0 1 2

2 2 2 0

3 3 2 0

0 9 9 9

Output:

1

1

3

3

12

In the first test case, with [1,2,3], Bob wins once.

In the second test case, with [1,3,4,4], which is [1,3,4,4], XOR=1^3^4^4=1^3^0=1^3=2, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence is [3,4,4], XOR=3^4^4=3^0=3, Alice wins.

Remove another number, say 3, sequence is [4,4], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Remove one 4, sequence is [4], XOR=4, Alice wins.

Remove the last 4, sequence is empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice, but the output is 1.

Wait, perhaps Bob wins only when the sequence is non-empty.

Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the games are played.

Wait, perhaps each removal corresponds to a game with n, n-1, ..., 1, but not including the empty sequence.

So, in the first test case, with n=3:

- Game with n=3: XOR=0, Bob wins.

- Eve removes one number, game with n=2: XOR=1, Alice wins.

- Eve removes another number, game with n=1: XOR=3, Alice wins.

So, Bob wins once.

In the second test case, with n=4:

- Game with n=4: XOR=1^3^4^4=1^3^0=2, Alice wins.

- Eve removes one number, game with n=3: say remove 1, XOR=3^4^4=3^0=3, Alice wins.

- Remove another number, game with n=2: remove 3, XOR=4^4=0, Bob wins.

- Remove one 4, game with n=1: XOR=4, Alice wins.

So, Bob wins once.

But in the output, it's 1 for the first two test cases.

Then, in the third test case, with p0=2, p1=2, p2=2, p3=0, which is [1,1,2,2,3,3].

XOR=1^1^2^2^3^3=0^0^0=0, Bob wins.

Then, remove one number, say 1, sequence is [1,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^2^2^3^3=1^0^0=1, Alice wins.

Remove another number, say 1, sequence is [2,2,3,3], XOR=0^0=0, Bob wins.

Remove another number, say 2, sequence is [2,3,3], XOR=2^3^3=2^0=2, Alice wins.

Remove another number, say 2, sequence is [3,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Remove one 3, sequence is [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Remove the last 3, sequence is empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins four times, but the output is 3.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe the empty sequence is not counted.

In the third test case, Bob wins three times.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game.

In the first test case, Bob wins once (with n=3), and the empty sequence is not counted.

In the second test case, Bob wins once (with n=2).

In the third test case, Bob wins three times (with n=3, n=2, and n=0), but output is 3, perhaps the empty sequence is counted.

Wait, but in the first test case, Bob wins once (n=3), and the empty sequence is not counted, which matches output=1.

In the third test case, Bob wins three times (n=3, n=2, n=0), output=3.

So, perhaps the empty sequence is counted.

But in the first test case, Bob wins twice (n=3 and n=0), but output=1.

Wait, perhaps not.

I need to clarify the rules.

The problem says: "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems that for each k from n down to 0, there is a game with k numbers, and Eve chooses the order in which numbers are removed to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, for n=3, games with 3,2,1,0 numbers.

In the first test case, with [1,2,3]:

- n=3: XOR=0, Bob wins.

- n=2: XOR=1 or 3 or 2, depending on which number is removed. Eve can choose to remove a number so that XOR is non-zero, making Alice win.

- n=1: XOR=1 or 2 or 3, Alice wins.

- n=0: XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Eve can arrange for Bob to win twice.

But the output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

So, perhaps Eve cannot arrange for both n=3 and n=0 to be considered.

Wait, maybe the games are played in sequence, and Eve removes one number at a time, and the remaining sequence is used for the next game.

So, for n=3:

- Game with n=3: XOR of [1,2,3]=0, Bob wins.

- Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence is [2,3].

- Game with n=2: XOR of [2,3]=1, Alice wins.

- Eve removes one number, say 2, sequence is [3].

- Game with n=1: XOR of [3]=3, Alice wins.

- Eve removes 3, sequence is empty.

- Game with n=0: XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice, but output is 1.

Wait, perhaps Bob wins only when the sequence is non-empty.

Or perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game.

Looking back at the problem, it says "this continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, perhaps the games are played with n=3, n=2, n=1, and n=0.

But in the first test case, the output is 1, meaning Bob wins only once.

So, perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game.

Wait, but in the third test case, Bob wins three times, which includes n=3, n=2, and n=0.

But if n=0 is not considered, then why is Bob winning three times in the third test case?

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the problem differently.

Maybe Eve can choose the order in which numbers are removed to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, in the first test case, with [1,2,3], Eve can choose to remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins only once.

But how?

If Eve removes 1 first, then sequence is [2,3], XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then remove 2, sequence is [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice.

But the output is 1, meaning Eve can only make Bob win once.

So, perhaps there is a different way to remove numbers.

Wait, maybe if Eve removes 2 first, sequence is [1,3], XOR=1^3=2, Alice wins.

Then remove 1, sequence is [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Again, Bob wins only once.

So, in this case, Bob can win at most once.

Hence, the output is 1.

In the second test case, with [1,0,1,2], which is [1,3,4,4], XOR=1^3^4^4=1^3^0=2, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence is [3,4,4], XOR=3^4^4=3^0=3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, sequence is [4,4], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, remove one 4, sequence is [4], XOR=4, Alice wins.

Then, remove the last 4, sequence is empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice, but the output is 1, meaning Eve can only make Bob win once.

Wait, perhaps Eve cannot arrange for Bob to win twice.

Let's see:

- Start with [1,3,4,4], XOR=2, Alice wins.

- Eve removes 4, sequence is [1,3,4], XOR=1^3^4=6, Alice wins.

- Remove 4, sequence is [1,3], XOR=1^3=2, Alice wins.

- Remove 1, sequence is [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

- Remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins only once.

Alternatively:

- Start with [1,3,4,4], XOR=2, Alice wins.

- Remove 1, sequence is [3,4,4], XOR=3^4^4=3^0=3, Alice wins.

- Remove 3, sequence is [4,4], XOR=0, Bob wins.

- Remove 4, sequence is [4], XOR=4, Alice wins.

- Remove 4, sequence is empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Again, Bob wins twice.

But the output is 1, meaning Eve can only make Bob win once.

So, perhaps in some removal orders, Bob wins only once.

But in this case, it seems that Bob can win at least once, and in some orders, twice.

But the output is 1, so perhaps in optimal play, Eve can only make Bob win once.

Wait, maybe the problem considers only up to n=1, not including n=0.

So, in the first test case, with n=3, games with n=3, n=2, n=1.

Bob wins only when n=3, output=1.

In the third test case, with n=6, games with n=6,5,4,3,2,1.

Bob wins when n=6, n=4, n=2, so output=3.

Wait, but in the third test case, the output is 3, which matches Bob winning at n=6, n=4, n=2.

So, perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game.

In that case, in the first test case, Bob wins only when n=3, output=1.

In the second test case, Bob wins when n=4 and n=2, but output is 1, meaning Eve can only make Bob win once.

Wait, confusion again.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps I need to find the number of times the XOR of the sequence is zero for various subsets of the sequence.

But no, Eve removes one number at a time, so it's not about arbitrary subsets, but about the sequence of removals.

This seems complicated.

Looking at the problem again, perhaps I need to find the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero after each removal.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, which happens when the XOR is zero.

So, Eve needs to choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

This seems tricky.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let's consider the properties of XOR.

XOR is associative and commutative.

The XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the number of ones, threes, etc., is even.

Wait, no.

Wait, in binary, XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if, for each bit position, the number of ones in that bit position is even.

Given that the numbers are up to 4, which is 100 in binary, we can look at each bit position separately.

Let's consider the binary representations:

- 0: 000

- 1: 001

- 2: 010

- 3: 011

- 4: 100

So, we have three bit positions: bit0 (LSB), bit1, and bit2.

For the XOR of the sequence to be zero, in each bit position, the number of ones must be even.

So, for the entire sequence, the number of ones in each bit position must be even.

Given that, perhaps I can count the number of ones in each bit position and see how many times the XOR is zero as numbers are removed.

Wait, but Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

This seems complex.

Maybe I need to look at the problem differently.

Let's consider that Eve can choose the order in which numbers are removed.

She wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

So, perhaps she can arrange the removal order to make the XOR zero as often as possible.

Given that, perhaps there's a formula based on the counts of each number.

Let's consider the counts:

- p0: number of ones

- p1: number of twos

- p2: number of threes

- p3: number of fours

First, I need to find the total number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero across all steps from n down to 0.

But Eve can choose the order of removals to maximize this count.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the counts.

Wait, maybe I can look at the XOR of the entire sequence and see how it changes as numbers are removed.

The XOR after removing a number is equal to the XOR of the original sequence XOR the removed number.

Wait, is that correct?

Actually, no.

If the original sequence is S, and we remove an element a, then the XOR of the remaining sequence is XOR(S) XOR a.

Because XOR is its own inverse.

Wait, yes.

So, if the original XOR is XOR_S, then after removing a, the new XOR is XOR_S XOR a.

Given that, Eve can choose which a to remove to make the new XOR zero or non-zero, depending on her goal.

So, at each step, Eve can choose to remove a number a such that XOR_S XOR a is zero, if possible.

But, she has to remove one number at each step, and she wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Wait, but the XOR of the remaining sequence is XOR_S XOR a.

So, she wants XOR_S XOR a = 0, which means a = XOR_S.

So, if XOR_S is present in the sequence, she can remove it to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero.

If XOR_S is not present, she can't make the XOR zero by removing a number.

So, at each step, if XOR_S is present in the sequence, she can remove it to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero.

Otherwise, she has to remove another number, and the XOR of the remaining sequence will be XOR_S XOR a, which may or may not be zero.

This seems like a strategy Eve can use to maximize Bob's wins.

So, the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times XOR_S is present in the sequence, allowing her to remove it and make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero.

Wait, but it's a bit more involved because the XOR changes at each step.

Let's think recursively.

At each step, Eve can choose to remove a number that makes the XOR of the remaining sequence zero, if possible.

If not, she removes any number.

But this seems too time-consuming for large n.

Given that n can be up to the sum of p0 to p3, which can be up to 200 per group, but t can be up to 10^4, I need an efficient solution.

Perhaps there's a pattern or formula based on the counts p0 to p3.

Let me try to find a pattern.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

First test case:

p0=1, p1=1, p2=1, p3=0

Sequence: [1,2,3]

XOR_S = 1^2^3 = 0

Bob wins once.

Output:1

Second test case:

p0=1, p1=0, p2=1, p3=2

Sequence: [1,3,4,4]

XOR_S = 1^3^4^4 = 1^3^0 = 2

Alice wins.

Possible removals:

- Remove 1: [3,4,4], XOR=3^4^4=3^0=3, Alice wins.

- Remove 3: [1,4,4], XOR=1^4^4=1^0=1, Alice wins.

- Remove 4: [1,3,4], XOR=1^3^4=6, Alice wins.

- Remove 4: [1,3,4], same as above.

So, no matter which number Eve removes, the remaining sequence has a non-zero XOR.

Then, in the next step, Eve removes another number, and so on.

So, in this case, Bob wins only once, when n=4.

Output:1

Third test case:

p0=2, p1=2, p2=2, p3=0

Sequence: [1,1,2,2,3,3]

XOR_S = 1^1^2^2^3^3 = 0

Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence is [1,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^2^2^3^3=1^0^0=1, Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, say 1, sequence is [2,2,3,3], XOR=0^0=0, Bob wins.

Then, remove 2, sequence is [2,3,3], XOR=2^3^3=2^0=2, Alice wins.

Then, remove 2, sequence is [3,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, remove 3, sequence is [3], XOR=3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

But the output is 3, meaning Bob wins three times.

Wait, but in this sequence, Bob wins when n=6, n=4, and n=2.

So, three times.

Output:3

Fourth test case:

p0=3, p1=3, p2=2, p3=0

Sequence: [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]

XOR_S = 1^1^1^2^2^2^3^3 = 1^1^1 ^ 2^2^2 ^ 3^3 = 1^0^0 =1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number.

If she removes 1, sequence is [1,1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^1^2^2^2^3^3=1^0^2^0=1^2=3, Alice wins.

If she removes 2, sequence is [1,1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^1^1^2^2^3^3=1^0^0^3=1^3=2, Alice wins.

If she removes 3, sequence is [1,1,1,2,2,2,3], XOR=1^1^1^2^2^2^3=1^0^0^3=1^3=2, Alice wins.

So, no matter which number she removes, the remaining sequence has a non-zero XOR.

Then, in the next step, she removes another number, and so on.

So, Bob wins only once, when n=0.

But the output is 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, p0=3, p1=3, p2=2, p3=0, which is [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]

XOR_S = 1^1^1^2^2^2^3^3 = 1^1^1 ^ 2^2^2 ^ 3^3 = 1^0^0=1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number.

If she removes 1, sequence is [1,1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^1^2^2^2^3^3=1^1^2^2^2^3^3=0^2^3^3=0^2^0=0, Bob wins.

If she removes 2, sequence is [1,1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^1^1^2^2^3^3=1^0^2^0=1^2=3, Alice wins.

If she removes 3, sequence is [1,1,1,2,2,2,3], XOR=1^1^1^2^2^2^3=1^0^0^3=1^3=2, Alice wins.

So, to maximize Bob's wins, she should remove 1 first, making XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, sequence is [1,1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Wait, but in the previous step, she already made XOR=0 by removing 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the first step, n=8, XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one 1, sequence is [1,1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes another number.

If she removes 1, sequence is [1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^2^2^2^3^3=1^0^2^0=1^2=3, Alice wins.

If she removes 2, sequence is [1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^1^2^2^3^3=0^0^0=0, Bob wins.

If she removes 3, sequence is [1,1,2,2,2,3], XOR=1^1^2^2^2^3=0^2^3=2^3=1, Alice wins.

To maximize Bob's wins, she should remove 2, making XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, sequence is [1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, remove another number.

If she removes 1, sequence is [1,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^2^2^3^3=1^0^0=1, Alice wins.

If she removes 2, sequence is [1,1,2,3,3], XOR=1^1^2^3^3=0^2^0=2, Alice wins.

If she removes 3, sequence is [1,1,2,2,3], XOR=1^1^2^2^3=0^0^3=3, Alice wins.

So, no matter which number she removes, Alice wins.

Then, in the next step, Eve removes another number, and so on.

So, in this case, Bob wins twice: at n=8 and n=6.

But the output is 3, meaning Bob wins three times.

So, perhaps there is a better removal order.

Wait, maybe if she removes differently.

Let's try:

- Start with n=8, XOR=1, Alice wins.

- Remove 2, sequence is [1,1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^1^1^2^2^3^3=1^0^0^3=1^3=2, Alice wins.

- Remove 1, sequence is [1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR=1^1^2^2^3^3=0^0^0=0, Bob wins.

- Remove 3, sequence is [1,1,2,2,3], XOR=1^1^2^2^3=0^0^3=3, Alice wins.

- Remove 3, sequence is [1,1,2,2], XOR=1^1^2^2=0, Bob wins.

- Remove 2, sequence is [1,1,2], XOR=1^1^2=0, Bob wins.

- Remove 1, sequence is [1,2], XOR=1^2=3, Alice wins.

- Remove 1, sequence is [2], XOR=2, Alice wins.

- Remove 2, sequence is empty, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins four times.

But the output is 3, so perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game.

Therefore, Bob wins three times: at n=4, n=3, and n=2.

Wait, in this removal order, Bob wins at n=6, n=4, n=3, n=2, n=0.

But perhaps not all of these are possible.

I'm getting confused.

Perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let's consider the total number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Eve can choose the order of removals to maximize this count.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero at each step.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of times the XOR is zero for subsets of the sequence.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the properties of XOR again.

Given that XOR is associative and commutative, and that XOR_S XOR a is the XOR of the remaining sequence after removing a.

Eve wants to choose a such that XOR_S XOR a = 0, which means a = XOR_S.

So, if XOR_S is present in the sequence, she can remove it to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero.

If XOR_S is not present, she has to remove another number, and the XOR of the remaining sequence will be XOR_S XOR a.

Then, in the next step, she can again try to remove the number equal to the new XOR_S to make the XOR zero again.

So, the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times XOR_S is present in the sequence.

Wait, but XOR_S can change at each step.

Wait, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times XOR_S is zero.

But that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the binary representations.

Given that the numbers are up to 4, which is 100 in binary, we have three bit positions.

For the XOR to be zero, each bit position must have an even number of ones.

So, for the entire sequence, if each bit position has an even number of ones, XOR is zero.

If we remove a number, we flip the bits in those positions.

So, if a number has a one in a certain bit position, removing it flips that bit in the XOR.

Similarly for other bit positions.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider each bit position separately.

Let's consider bit0 (LSB):

- Number of ones in bit0: p0 (ones:1, threes:1)

- Number of twos:0 in bit0

- Number of fours:0 in bit0

Wait, no.

Wait, the binary representations:

- 0: 000

- 1: 001

- 2: 010

- 3: 011

- 4: 100

So, bit0: ones and threes have 1 in bit0.

bit1: twos and threes have 1 in bit1.

bit2: fours have 1 in bit2.

So, the total number of ones in bit0 is p0 + p2.

In bit1: p1 + p2.

In bit2: p3.

For the XOR to be zero, each of these counts must be even.

So, initially, XOR is zero if and only if p0 + p2 is even, p1 + p2 is even, and p3 is even.

Similarly, after removing a number, the counts change accordingly.

For example, removing a one: decrement p0, so bit0 count decreases by 1, bit1 remains same, bit2 remains same.

Removing a two: decrement p1, so bit1 count decreases by 1, bit0 remains same, bit2 remains same.

Removing a three: decrement p2, so bit0 and bit1 counts decrease by 1, bit2 remains same.

Removing a four: decrement p3, so bit2 count decreases by 1, bit0 and bit1 remain same.

So, after each removal, the parity of the bit counts changes based on the number removed.

Eve wants to choose which number to remove to make the XOR zero at each step.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using the concept of nim games or something similar, but it's getting too complicated.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the sample inputs and try to generalize from there.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

Test case 1: p0=1, p1=1, p2=1, p3=0

Output:1

Test case 2: p0=1, p1=0, p2=1, p3=2

Output:1

Test case 3: p0=2, p1=2, p2=2, p3=0

Output:3

Test case 4: p0=3, p1=3, p2=2, p3=0

Output:3

Test case 5: p0=0, p1=9, p2=9, p3=9

Output:12

Looking for a pattern:

In test case 1, sum of p's is 3, output is 1.

In test case 2, sum of p's is 4, output is 1.

In test case 3, sum of p's is 6, output is 3.

In test case 4, sum of p's is 8, output is 3.

In test case 5, sum of p's is 27, output is 12.

Not sure about the pattern.

Wait, perhaps the output is the floor of (sum of p's)/2.

In test case 1: 3//2=1

Test case 2: 4//2=2, but output is 1.

Doesn't match.

Wait, no.

Wait, test case 3: 6//2=3, matches output=3.

Test case 4: 8//2=4, but output is 3.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of even p's.

In test case 1: p0=1, p1=1, p2=1, p3=0: one even (p3=0), output=1.

Test case 2: p0=1, p1=0, p2=1, p3=2: two even (p1=0, p3=2), output=1.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of p's that are greater than zero and even.

Test case 1: p3=0 (even, but zero), output=1.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times the XOR is zero, which is when p0 + p2 is even, p1 + p2 is even, and p3 is even.

In test case 1: p0=1, p1=1, p2=1, p3=0

p0 + p2 = 1 + 1 = even

p1 + p2 = 1 + 1 = even

p3 = 0, even

So, initially, XOR is zero.

Then, after removing one number, the parities change.

For example, removing one:

p0 becomes 0, p2 remains 1

p0 + p2 = 0 + 1 = odd

p1 + p2 = 1 + 1 = even

p3 = 0, even

So, XOR is not zero.

Removing two:

p1 becomes 0, p2=1

p0 + p2=1 +1=even

p1 + p2=0 +1=odd

p3=0, even

XOR not zero.

Removing three:

p2 becomes 0

p0 + p2=1 +0=odd

p1 + p2=1 +0=odd

p3=0, even

XOR not zero.

Removing four: not present.

So, only initially, XOR is zero.

Hence, Bob wins only once.

Output=1.

In test case 2: p0=1, p1=0, p2=1, p3=2

p0 + p2 =1 +1=even

p1 + p2=0 +1=odd

p3=2, even

So, initially, XOR is not zero.

Then, after removing one number:

- Remove one: p0=0, p2=1

p0 + p2=0 +1=odd

p1 + p2=0 +1=odd

p3=2, even

XOR not zero.

- Remove three: p0=1, p2=0

p0 + p2=1 +0=odd

p1 + p2=0 +0=even

p3=2, even

XOR not zero.

- Remove four: p0=1, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1

p0 + p2=1 +1=even

p1 + p2=0 +1=odd

p3=1, odd

XOR not zero.

- Remove four: same as above.

So, in this case, Bob cannot make XOR zero by removing any number.

Hence, Bob wins only once, when n=0.

But in the first test case, n=0 is not considered, output=1.

Wait, in the first test case, n=0 is considered, output=1.

Wait, perhaps n=0 is always considered a win for Bob, but only if the sequence is empty.

But in the first test case, Bob wins only once, possibly at n=3.

Wait, I'm getting tangled.

Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let's consider that Eve can arrange the removal order to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the floor of (sum of p's +1)/2.

For test case 1: (3+1)/2=2, but output=1.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of even counts among p0 + p2, p1 +
