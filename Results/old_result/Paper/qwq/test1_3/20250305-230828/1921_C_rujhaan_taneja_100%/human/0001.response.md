Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stepan has to send n messages at specific moments, m1 to mn, and his phone has an initial charge f. The phone loses charge at a rate of a units per unit of time while it's on, and turning it off and on again costs b units of charge each time. The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the phone running out of charge.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's happening here. The messages are to be sent at increasing moments, so m1 < m2 < ... < mn. The phone starts with f charge at moment 0, and it's on at that moment.

The phone loses charge over time while it's on, at a rate of a per time unit. So, if the phone is on from time t1 to t2, it will lose a*(t2 - t1) charge during that period.

Additionally, Stepan can choose to turn the phone off and on again, which costs b charge each time he does this. Turning it off and on is instantaneous, meaning he can do it at the same moment as sending a message.

The main constraint is that the phone's charge must be greater than zero at the moment a message is sent. If the charge drops to zero or below, he can't send the message.

So, I need to find a strategy for when to turn the phone on and off to minimize charge consumption and ensure that there's always enough charge to send each message.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, consider that if Stepan keeps the phone on the entire time from moment 0 to mn, the charge consumed would be a * mn. If f is greater than or equal to a * mn, then he can send all messages without turning the phone off. But probably, f is less than that, so he needs to turn the phone off at some points to save charge.

The idea is to turn the phone off during periods when no messages are being sent, to reduce charge loss over time.

Let's consider the intervals between message sending moments. Between m(i) and m(i+1), Stepan can choose to turn the phone off to save charge.

But turning the phone off and on again costs b charge each time. So, there's a trade-off: turning it off saves a*(t2 - t1) charge, but costs 2*b (for turning it off and then on again).

So, for each interval between messages, I need to decide whether it's worth turning the phone off during that interval.

Let's formalize this.

Suppose there are messages at moments m0=0, m1, m2, ..., mn.

Initially, the phone is on at moment 0.

For each interval [m(i), m(i+1)), I need to decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off during that interval.

If I keep it on, the charge consumed in that interval is a*(m(i+1) - m(i)).

If I turn it off at m(i) and on at m(i+1), the charge consumed is b (for turning it off and on again).

So, the net savings by turning it off is a*(m(i+1) - m(i)) - b.

But, since turning it off and on again is a one-time cost of b, actually, the cost is b per off-on cycle.

Wait, no. Turning it off costs b, and turning it on again costs another b, so total cost is 2*b per off-on cycle.

Wait, but the problem says "turning it off and on again consumes b units of energy each time." So, each time he turns it off and then on, it costs b.

Wait, let's read it again: "Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action consumes b units of energy each time."

So, each time he performs a turn-off and then a turn-on, it costs b.

Wait, no: "This action consumes b units of energy each time." Hmm.

Wait, the problem says: "Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action consumes b units of energy each time."

So, it seems that turning off and then turning on again is considered one action, costing b.

So, each time he decides to turn off the phone and later turn it on again, it costs b.

Wait, but the problem also says: "turning on and off to be instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone at the same moment."

So, turning off and turning on again is one action, costing b, and it's instantaneous.

So, each time he chooses to turn off and then on again, it costs b.

Therefore, for each interval between messages, he can choose to keep the phone on, which costs a*(time difference), or turn it off and on again, which costs b.

He needs to minimize the total charge consumption, and check if it's less than or equal to f.

Wait, but the problem says: "the phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action consumes b units of energy each time."

So, turning off and on consumes b units of energy each time he does this pair of actions.

So, for each period where the phone is on, there is a b cost associated with turning it on (assuming he turns it off at some point).

Wait, maybe I need to model it differently.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose Stepan keeps the phone on continuously from the start to the end. The total charge consumed would be a * mn, and he starts with f charge. If f >= a * mn, then he can send all messages without turning it off.

But if f < a * mn, he needs to find a way to save charge by turning the phone off during some intervals.

Each time he decides to turn the phone off at some moment and turn it on again at another moment, it costs b charge.

While the phone is off, it doesn't consume charge, but turning it off and on again costs b each time.

So, he can group the message sending moments into chunks, where within each chunk, the phone is kept on, and between chunks, the phone is turned off and on again.

The total charge consumed would be:

sum over chunks of a * (max(m) - min(m) in the chunk) + b * (number of chunks - 1)

Wait, not sure.

Wait, let's think in terms of keeping the phone on only during specific intervals.

For each interval between messages, he can choose to keep the phone on or turn it off.

If he keeps it on, it costs a * (m(i+1) - m(i)).

If he turns it off between m(i) and m(i+1), it costs b, and the phone is on only at the moments when messages are sent.

Wait, but turning it off and on again costs b each time he does this.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a series of decisions: for each gap between messages, decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let’s define the total charge consumption as the sum over all intervals between messages of either:

- a * (m(i+1) - m(i)) if the phone is kept on during that interval, or

- b if the phone is turned off at m(i) and turned on at m(i+1).

The goal is to choose for each interval whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again, such that the total charge consumption is minimized, and check if this minimum is less than or equal to f.

But maybe there's an optimal strategy to decide when to turn the phone off and on again.

Let’s consider the cost savings of turning the phone off during an interval.

If the phone is kept on during an interval of length t, it costs a*t.

If instead, he turns it off and on again at the ends of the interval, it costs b.

So, turning it off and on again is better if b < a*t.

In other words, if a*t > b, then turning it off and on again is cheaper.

Wait, no.

Wait, if a*t > b, then turning it off and on again costs less (b vs a*t), so it's better to turn it off.

Wait, but actually, if a*t > b, then turning it off and on again costs b, which is less than a*t, so it's better to turn it off.

Conversely, if a*t < b, then keeping it on costs less (a*t vs b), so it's better to keep it on.

Therefore, for each interval between messages, if a*(m(i+1) - m(i)) > b, then it's better to turn the phone off and on again, costing b.

Otherwise, it's better to keep it on, costing a*(m(i+1) - m(i)).

So, the minimal total charge consumption is the sum over all intervals of the minimum between a*t and b.

Wait, but there's a catch here.

Because turning the phone off and on again is a single action that costs b, and it can cover multiple intervals if he keeps the phone off for several consecutive intervals.

Wait, no.

Wait, actually, turning the phone off and on again is an action that costs b, and it allows the phone to be off during one or more intervals.

But, each time he decides to turn the phone off and then on again, it costs b.

So, if he turns the phone off after m(i) and turns it on at m(j), where j > i, it costs b once for the off-on action, and the phone is off during all intervals from m(i) to m(j).

The charge consumption would be b plus the charge consumed while the phone is on at the message sending moments.

Wait, but the phone consumes charge only when it's on, and at the rate of a per unit time while it's on.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of keeping the phone on only at the message sending moments, and turning it off in between.

But, since turning it off and on again costs b each time, there is a trade-off between keeping it on for longer intervals or turning it off and on again multiple times.

So, to minimize the total charge consumption, for each interval between messages, he should choose to turn the phone off if a*t > b, and keep it on otherwise.

Then, the total charge consumption would be the sum over all intervals of min(a*t, b).

Additionally, we need to consider that at the start, the phone is on at moment 0, and he might choose to turn it off before the first message, but I think it's better to keep it on until the first message.

Wait, no. At moment 0, the phone is on, and he can choose to turn it off immediately or keep it on until the first message.

Wait, but the first message is at m1, so from 0 to m1, if he keeps the phone on, it costs a*m1.

If he turns it off at 0 and turns it on at m1, it costs b.

So, he should compare a*m1 and b, and choose the smaller one.

Similarly, between m1 and m2, he can choose to keep the phone on, costing a*(m2 - m1), or turn it off and on again, costing b.

And so on for each interval between messages.

Therefore, the minimal total charge consumption is the sum over all intervals of min(a*(m(i+1) - m(i)), b).

Then, we need to check if this sum is less than or equal to the initial charge f.

If it is, then it's possible to send all messages without running out of charge, and we should output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Wait, but in the first test case of the example:

1 3 1 5

3

So, n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

Messages at m1=3

So, only one interval: from 0 to 3

a*t = 1*3 = 3

b = 5

min(3,5) = 3

Total charge consumption is 3

f=3, which is equal to 3, so it should be "YES"

But in the example, it's "NO"

Hmm, contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes ≤ 0 ), it is impossible to send a message at that moment."

So, even if the total charge consumption is less than or equal to f, we need to ensure that at the moment of sending each message, the charge is greater than zero.

Wait, perhaps there's a timing issue here.

In the first test case, if he keeps the phone on from 0 to 3, consuming a*t = 1*3 = 3 charge, and f=3, then at moment 3, the charge is exactly 0, which is ≤0, so he can't send the message.

Hence, it should be "NO"

So, I need to ensure that at the moment of sending each message, the charge is strictly greater than zero.

Therefore, when calculating the charge at each message sending moment, I need to make sure that after all the charge consumption up to that moment, the charge is still greater than zero.

So, it's not just the total charge consumption being less than or equal to f, but also ensuring that at each message sending moment, the charge is still positive.

Therefore, I need to simulate the charge consumption up to each message sending moment and ensure that just before sending the message, the charge is greater than zero.

Wait, but in the minimal total charge consumption approach, sum of min(a*t, b) for all intervals, if this sum is less than or equal to f, and at each message sending moment, the charge is greater than zero, then it should be "YES"

But in the first test case, sum is 3, f=3, but at m=3, charge is exactly 0, which is not greater than zero, hence "NO"

So, perhaps I need to ensure that the charge is strictly greater than zero at each message sending moment.

Therefore, I need to adjust the charge consumption calculation to account for this.

One way to handle this is to consider that at each message sending moment, sending the message requires some minimal charge, say ε > 0, but since charge consumption is continuous, and we're dealing with discrete moments, perhaps the minimal charge required at each message sending moment is a small positive value.

But to simplify, perhaps I can ensure that after all charge consumption up to a message sending moment, the charge is strictly greater than zero.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that after all charge consumption up to just before sending the message, the charge is strictly greater than zero.

But in the first test case, if he keeps the phone on from 0 to 3, consuming 3 units, and f=3, then at m=3, charge is 0, which is not greater than zero, hence "NO"

Alternatively, if he turns off the phone at 0 and turns it on at 3, costing b=5, but f=3, which is less than 5, so also "NO"

Hence, in this case, it's "NO"

So, perhaps in general, I need to ensure that at each message sending moment, the charge is strictly greater than zero.

Therefore, in the charge consumption calculation, I need to make sure that after all charge consumption up to that moment, the charge is still positive.

This might require a more careful approach than just summing up the minimal costs for each interval.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I model the charge consumption over time.

At moment 0, charge is f.

If the phone is on from 0 to m1, charge consumed is a*m1, so charge at m1 is f - a*m1.

If f - a*m1 > 0, then he can send the first message.

Similarly, between m1 and m2, if he keeps the phone on, charge consumed is a*(m2 - m1), so charge at m2 is f - a*m1 - a*(m2 - m1) = f - a*m2.

Alternatively, if he turns it off between m1 and m2 and turns it on at m2, charge consumed is b, so charge at m2 is f - a*m1 - b.

He chooses the option that results in less charge consumption.

Wait, but he needs to ensure that at m2, charge is greater than zero.

So, he needs to choose the option where f - a*m1 - min(a*(m2 - m1), b) > 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the charge at each message sending moment.

Let me try to formalize an algorithm.

Initialize charge = f

For each message sending moment m_i:

    If it's the first message:

        Option 1: keep the phone on from 0 to m1, consume a*m1

        Option 2: turn off at 0, turn on at m1, consume b

        Choose the option with the least consumption, provided that charge after consumption > 0

        Update charge accordingly

    Else:

        Option 1: keep the phone on from m_{i-1} to m_i, consume a*(m_i - m_{i-1})

        Option 2: turn off at m_{i-1}, turn on at m_i, consume b

        Choose the option with the least consumption, provided that charge after consumption > 0

        Update charge accordingly

    If at any step, charge after consumption <= 0, then it's impossible

    Otherwise, continue

    At the end, if all messages are sent, output "YES"; else, "NO"

This seems reasonable.

Let me test this algorithm with the first test case:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5

m1=3

Option 1: keep on from 0 to 3, consume 1*3=3, charge after consumption = 3 - 3 = 0, which is not > 0, so invalid

Option 2: turn off at 0, turn on at 3, consume 5, charge after consumption = 3 - 5 = -2, which is < 0, so invalid

Hence, "NO"

Second test case:

7 21 1 3

Messages: 4 6 10 13 17 20 26

f=21, a=1, b=3

Let's apply the algorithm:

Initialize charge = 21

First message at m1=4

Option 1: keep on from 0 to 4, consume 1*4=4, charge = 21 - 4 = 17 > 0

Option 2: turn off at 0, turn on at 4, consume 3, charge = 21 - 3 = 18 > 0

Choose the minimum consumption: 3 (Option 2)

So, charge = 18

Second message at m2=6

Time difference: 6 - 4 = 2

Option 1: keep on from 4 to 6, consume 1*2=2, charge = 18 - 2 = 16 > 0

Option 2: turn off at 4, turn on at 6, consume 3, charge = 18 - 3 = 15 > 0

Choose the minimum consumption: 2 (Option 1)

So, charge = 16

Third message at m3=10

Time difference: 10 - 6 = 4

Option 1: keep on from 6 to 10, consume 1*4=4, charge = 16 - 4 = 12 > 0

Option 2: turn off at 6, turn on at 10, consume 3, charge = 16 - 3 = 13 > 0

Choose the minimum consumption: 3 (Option 2)

So, charge = 13

Fourth message at m4=13

Time difference: 13 - 10 = 3

Option 1: keep on from 10 to 13, consume 1*3=3, charge = 13 - 3 = 10 > 0

Option 2: turn off at 10, turn on at 13, consume 3, charge = 13 - 3 = 10 > 0

Choose the minimum consumption: 3 (Option 2)

So, charge = 10

Fifth message at m5=17

Time difference: 17 - 13 = 4

Option 1: keep on from 13 to 17, consume 1*4=4, charge = 10 - 4 = 6 > 0

Option 2: turn off at 13, turn on at 17, consume 3, charge = 10 - 3 = 7 > 0

Choose the minimum consumption: 3 (Option 2)

So, charge = 7

Sixth message at m6=20

Time difference: 20 - 17 = 3

Option 1: keep on from 17 to 20, consume 1*3=3, charge = 7 - 3 = 4 > 0

Option 2: turn off at 17, turn on at 20, consume 3, charge = 7 - 3 = 4 > 0

Choose the minimum consumption: 3 (Option 2)

So, charge = 4

Seventh message at m7=26

Time difference: 26 - 20 = 6

Option 1: keep on from 20 to 26, consume 1*6=6, charge = 4 - 6 = -2 <= 0, invalid

Option 2: turn off at 20, turn on at 26, consume 3, charge = 4 - 3 = 1 > 0

Choose Option 2

So, charge = 1

All messages are sent with charge still positive at each sending moment, so "YES"

This matches the example output.

Let me check the third test case:

5 10 1 2

Messages: 1 2 3 4 5

f=10, a=1, b=2

First message at m1=1

Option 1: keep on from 0 to 1, consume 1*1=1, charge=10-1=9>0

Option 2: turn off at 0, turn on at 1, consume 2, charge=10-2=8>0

Choose Option 1, consume 1, charge=9

Second message at m2=2

Time difference: 2-1=1

Option 1: keep on from 1 to 2, consume 1*1=1, charge=9-1=8>0

Option 2: turn off at 1, turn on at 2, consume 2, charge=9-2=7>0

Choose Option 1, consume 1, charge=8

Third message at m3=3

Time difference: 3-2=1

Option 1: keep on from 2 to 3, consume 1*1=1, charge=8-1=7>0

Option 2: turn off at 2, turn on at 3, consume 2, charge=8-2=6>0

Choose Option 1, consume 1, charge=7

Fourth message at m4=4

Time difference: 4-3=1

Option 1: keep on from 3 to 4, consume 1*1=1, charge=7-1=6>0

Option 2: turn off at 3, turn on at 4, consume 2, charge=7-2=5>0

Choose Option 1, consume 1, charge=6

Fifth message at m5=5

Time difference: 5-4=1

Option 1: keep on from 4 to 5, consume 1*1=1, charge=6-1=5>0

Option 2: turn off at 4, turn on at 5, consume 2, charge=6-2=4>0

Choose Option 1, consume 1, charge=5

All messages sent with charge positive, so "YES"

This also matches the example.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

    test_cases = int(input())

    for i in range(test_cases):

        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]

        n = feat[0]

        f = feat[1]

        a = feat[2]

        b = feat[-1]

        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]

        array2 = []

        for i in range(0, n):

            if i == 0:

                if arr[0] < b / a:

                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)

            elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:

                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)

        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:

            print('Yes')

        else:

            print('No')

Let's see what this program is doing.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, f, a, b, and the array of message moments.

Then, it initializes an empty list array2.

It iterates through the messages:

- For the first message, if arr[0] < b / a, append arr[0] * a to array2

- For other messages, if arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a, append (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a to array2

Then, it sums array2 and adds (n - len(array2)) * b, and checks if this is less than f.

If yes, prints "Yes"; else, "No"

Comparing this to my earlier algorithm, it seems similar in spirit, but simplified.

In my algorithm, for each interval, if a*t < b, choose to keep the phone on, consuming a*t; else, turn off and on, consuming b.

This is what the program is doing.

It's calculating the sum of a*t for intervals where t < b / a, and adding b for the remaining intervals.

Then, checking if this sum is less than f.

Wait, but in my earlier algorithm, I was also ensuring that at each message sending moment, the charge is strictly greater than zero.

But in this program, it's just checking if the total sum of minimal costs is less than f.

In the first test case, where n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5, m=3

Calculate if 3 < b / a = 5 / 1 = 5, which is true, so append 3 * 1 = 3 to array2

Then, sum(array2) = 3 + (1 - 1)*5 = 3 < f=3

But in Python, 3 < 3 is False, so it should print "No", which matches the example.

Wait, but in the program, it's sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f

Here, sum(array2) = 3, n=1, len(array2)=1, so (1-1)*5=0, total=3<3 is False, so "No"

Wait, but in Python, 3 < 3 is False, so "No"

In the second test case, n=7, f=21, a=1, b=3, messages:4,6,10,13,17,20,26

Calculate b / a = 3 / 1 = 3

For i=0, arr[0]=4 < 3? No, so don't append

Wait, arr[0]=4, 4 < 3? False, so don't append

For i=1, arr[1]-arr[0]=6-4=2 < 3? Yes, append 2*1=2 to array2

For i=2, arr[2]-arr[1]=10-6=4 < 3? No, don't append

For i=3, arr[3]-arr[2]=13-10=3 < 3? 3 < 3 is False, don't append

For i=4, arr[4]-arr[3]=17-13=4 < 3? No

For i=5, arr[5]-arr[4]=20-17=3 < 3? No

For i=6, arr[6]-arr[5]=26-20=6 < 3? No

So, array2 = [2]

sum(array2) = 2

n - len(array2) = 7 - 1 = 6

total = 2 + 6*3 = 2 + 18 = 20 < 21, which is True, so "Yes"

Which matches the example.

In the third test case, n=5, f=10, a=1, b=2, messages:1,2,3,4,5

b / a = 2 / 1 = 2

For i=0, arr[0]=1 < 2? Yes, append 1*1=1 to array2

For i=1, arr[1]-arr[0]=2-1=1 < 2? Yes, append 1*1=1 to array2

For i=2, arr[2]-arr[1]=3-2=1 < 2? Yes, append 1*1=1 to array2

For i=3, arr[3]-arr[2]=4-3=1 < 2? Yes, append 1*1=1 to array2

For i=4, arr[4]-arr[3]=5-4=1 < 2? Yes, append 1*1=1 to array2

So, array2 = [1,1,1,1,1], sum=5

n - len(array2)=5-5=0

total=5+0*2=5 <10, which is True, so "Yes"

Which matches the example.

So, it seems that this program is correctly implementing the minimal total charge consumption approach, and checking if it's less than f.

But in the first test case, it correctly outputs "NO" because sum(array2) + (n - len(array2))*b = 3 + 0*5 = 3 < 3 is False.

Wait, but in the first test case, arr[0]=3 < b/a=5/1=5, so append 3*1=3 to array2

n=1, len(array2)=1, so (1-1)*5=0

total=3+0=3 <3 is False, so "No"

Which is correct.

In the second test case, sum(array2)=2, (7-1)*3=18, total=20 <21, which is True, so "Yes"

In the third test case, sum(array2)=5, (5-5)*2=0, total=5 <10, which is True, so "Yes"

So, it seems correct.

But in my earlier analysis, I thought we need to ensure that at each message sending moment, the charge is strictly greater than zero.

However, in this program, it's just checking the total minimal charge consumption against f.

But in the first test case, when f=3 and total=3, it's "No", which aligns with the requirement that charge must be strictly greater than zero.

So, perhaps this approach inherently ensures that the charge is always positive.

Wait, but in the first test case, total consumption is 3, f=3, but at m=3, charge is 0, which is not greater than zero, hence "No"

So, perhaps by checking sum(array2) + (n - len(array2))*b < f, it's ensuring that the total consumption is less than f, and in cases where total consumption equals f, it's "No"

Hence, it's effectively checking if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2))*b <= f - ε for some small ε >0

But since we're dealing with integers, perhaps it's checking sum(array2) + (n - len(array2))*b < f

Which ensures that the total consumption is strictly less than f, hence charge at the end is f - consumption >0

But in reality, we need to ensure that at each message sending moment, the charge is greater than zero.

However, in the program, it's just checking the total consumption against f.

But in the first test case, total consumption is 3, f=3, which would leave charge at 0 at the last moment, which is invalid.

Hence, perhaps the program should check sum(array2) + (n - len(array2))*b <= f - ε for some small ε, but since we're dealing with integers, perhaps sum(array2) + (n - len(array2))*b < f

But in the program, it's sum(array2) + (n - len(array2))*b < f

Which would mean that f - consumption >0

Hence, it's ensuring that there's some positive charge left after all consumption, which satisfies the condition that at each message sending moment, charge is greater than zero.

Wait, but in the first test case, sum(array2) + (n - len(array2))*b =3 +0*5=3 <3 is False, so "No"

Which is correct.

In the second test case, 20 <21 is True, so "Yes"

In the third test case, 5 <10 is True, so "Yes"

Hence, it seems correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
