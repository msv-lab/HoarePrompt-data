Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to determine if there's a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that the sum of the absolute differences between each position and its value in the permutation equals a given value k. This sum is called the Manhattan value.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without repeating any numbers. For example, for n=3, the permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

The Manhattan value is calculated by taking each position in the permutation, finding the absolute difference between the number in that position and the position itself (considering positions are 1-indexed), and summing all these differences.

For instance, in the permutation [3,1,2] for n=3:

- |3 - 1| = 2

- |1 - 2| = 1

- |2 - 3| = 1

- Total Manhattan value = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

I need to find if such a permutation exists for given n and k, and if it does, output "Yes" followed by the permutation; otherwise, output "No".

Looking at the code provided, it seems to handle multiple test cases, as it reads an integer T first, which represents the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it calls func_4().

Let's dive into the functions:

1. **func_2()**: This function takes input for n and k, checks if k is odd. If k is odd, it returns (0,0), indicating no such permutation exists. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given n and checks if k exceeds this maximum. If k is beyond the maximum possible, it returns (0,0); else, it returns (n,k).

Wait a minute, why does it check if k is odd? Is the Manhattan value always even or something? I need to think about this.

Let's consider that each |p_i - i| can be either even or odd. But their sum can be even or odd depending on how many odd differences there are. Wait, no, an absolute difference can be odd or even, and their sum can be anything. For example, in [3,1,2], the differences are 2 (even), 1 (odd), and 1 (odd), summing to 4 (even). In [2,1,3], differences are |2-1|=1 (odd), |1-2|=1 (odd), |3-3|=0 (even), summing to 2 (even). Hmm, in both cases, the sum is even. Is that always the case?

Let me try n=2:

- [1,2]: |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 + 0 = 0 (even)

- [2,1]: |2-1| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 (even)

n=3:

- [1,2,3]: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

- [1,3,2]: |1-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

- [2,1,3]: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

- [2,3,1]: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

- [3,1,2]: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

- [3,2,1]: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 (wait, that's odd)

Wait, in [3,2,1] for n=3, the Manhattan value is 5, which is odd. So, the sum can be odd or even. Then, why does func_2() immediately return (0,0) if k is odd? This seems incorrect because there can be permutations with odd Manhattan values.

Let me check the problem statement again. It says k can be from 0 to 10^12, and n up to 2*10^5, with t up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of n across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

So, the code has a potential flaw in func_2() by dismissing odd k values immediately, which isn't always correct, as shown by the example [3,2,1] with n=3 and k=5.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes that the Manhattan value must be even, which is not the case.

Hence, Correctness: **False**
