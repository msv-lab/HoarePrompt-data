Alright, so I've got this problem here about Alice and Bob playing a game with their wallets. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, starting with Alice, and in each turn, they can choose to exchange wallets or keep their current one, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a move loses. I need to determine who wins if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics clearly. Each turn consists of two steps:

1. Choose to exchange wallets or keep the current one.

2. Remove one coin from the current wallet.

Also, the wallet can't have zero coins before removing a coin. So, if a player has zero coins, they can't remove a coin and thus lose.

Now, the problem is to determine the winner for multiple test cases, each with different values of 'a' and 'b'.

Looking at the provided program, it seems quite straightforward. There's a main function that reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, reads 'a' and 'b', calls func_1 to determine the winner, and collects the results to print them out.

But the key part is func_1, which just checks if the sum of 'a' and 'b' is even or odd. If it's even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Wait a minute, is this correct? Does the sum of coins determine the winner so simply?

I need to verify this logic because it seems too simplistic for what appears to be a more complex game.

Let me think about the game step by step.

First, consider the base case where both a and b are 1.

According to the example, Bob wins in this case.

Let's simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=1. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps: a=1, b=1. Then she removes 1 coin: a=0, b=1.

- Now Bob's turn: a=0, b=1. He can't swap because a=0, so he keeps his wallet and removes 1: a=0, b=0.

- Now Alice's turn: both wallets are empty, so she can't make a move. Hence, Bob wins.

Alternatively, if Alice doesn't swap:

- a=1, b=1. She removes 1: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1. He can't swap since a=0, so he keeps his wallet and removes 1: a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins again.

So in this case, whether Alice swaps or not, Bob wins.

Now, let's look at another example where a=1, b=4.

According to the example, Alice wins.

Let's try to simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=4. She can choose to swap or not.

- If she doesn't swap: a=0, b=4.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=4. He can't swap since a=0, so he keeps his wallet and removes 1: a=0, b=3.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=3. She can only not swap (since a=0), so a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=2. Can't swap, removes 1: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, so a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Alternatively, if Alice chooses to swap on her first turn:

- Swap: a=4, b=1.

- Remove 1: a=3, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=3, b=1. He can choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps: a=1, b=3.

- Remove 1: a=0, b=3.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=3. Can't swap, so a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=2. Can't swap, removes 1: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, so a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

So in both choices, Alice wins.

Interesting. So in this case, Alice can force a win by choosing to swap.

Now, looking back at the func_1 in the code, it just checks if a + b is even or odd.

In the first example, a=1, b=1: sum=2, even -> Bob wins.

But in the second example, a=1, b=4: sum=5, odd -> Alice wins.

Which matches the expected output.

Let's check another example: a=5, b=3. Sum=8, even -> Bob wins.

Is that correct?

Let's simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=5, b=3.

- Option 1: swap -> a=3, b=5. Remove 1: a=2, b=5.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=5. Swap -> a=5, b=2. Remove 1: a=4, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=4, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=4. Remove 1: a=1, b=4.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=4. Swap -> a=4, b=1. Remove 1: a=3, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=3, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=3. Remove 1: a=0, b=3.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=3. Can't swap, removes 1: a=0, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=2. Can't swap, a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Alternatively, if Alice doesn't swap initially:

- a=5, b=3. Remove 1: a=4, b=3.

- Bob's turn: a=4, b=3. Swap -> a=3, b=4. Remove 1: a=2, b=4.

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=4. Swap -> a=4, b=2. Remove 1: a=3, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=3, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=3. Remove 1: a=1, b=3.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=3. Swap -> a=3, b=1. Remove 1: a=2, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=2. Remove 1: a=0, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=2. Can't swap, a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

So in both choices, Bob wins.

Thus, the func_1 seems to be correct in this case.

Let me try another test case: a=4, b=5. Sum=9, odd -> Alice wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=4, b=5.

- Option 1: swap -> a=5, b=4. Remove 1: a=4, b=4.

- Bob's turn: a=4, b=4. Swap -> a=4, b=4. Remove 1: a=3, b=4.

- Alice's turn: a=3, b=4. Swap -> a=4, b=3. Remove 1: a=3, b=3.

- Bob's turn: a=3, b=3. Swap -> a=3, b=3. Remove 1: a=2, b=3.

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=3. Swap -> a=3, b=2. Remove 1: a=2, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=2. Remove 1: a=1, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=1. Remove 1: a=1, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=1. Remove 1: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Alternatively, if Alice doesn't swap initially:

- a=4, b=5. Remove 1: a=3, b=5.

- Bob's turn: a=3, b=5. Swap -> a=5, b=3. Remove 1: a=4, b=3.

- Alice's turn: a=4, b=3. Swap -> a=3, b=4. Remove 1: a=2, b=4.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=4. Swap -> a=4, b=2. Remove 1: a=3, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=3, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=3. Remove 1: a=1, b=3.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=3. Swap -> a=3, b=1. Remove 1: a=2, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=2. Remove 1: a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=2. Can't swap, a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

So again, regardless of choices, Alice wins.

Thus, the func_1 seems correct in this case as well.

Let me consider a case where a and b are large, say a=1000000000, b=1000000000. Sum is even, so Bob wins.

Is that correct?

Well, if both have the same number of coins, and the sum is even, then perhaps there's a symmetry that leads to Bob winning.

I need to think about the game in terms of game theory, perhaps finding a winning strategy based on the parity of the sum.

Wait, but is the sum's parity really the deciding factor?

Let me consider another test case: a=1, b=2. Sum=3, odd -> Alice wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=2.

- Option 1: swap -> a=2, b=1. Remove 1: a=1, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=1. Remove 1: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Alternatively, if Alice doesn't swap:

- a=1, b=2. Remove 1: a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=2. Can't swap, removes 1: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

So Alice wins in both choices, which matches the func_1's output.

Another test case: a=2, b=2. Sum=4, even -> Bob wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=2.

- Option 1: swap -> a=2, b=2. Remove 1: a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=1. Remove 1: a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=1. Remove 1: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Alternatively, if Alice doesn't swap initially:

- a=2, b=2. Remove 1: a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=1. Remove 1: a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=1. Remove 1: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Again, matches the func_1's output.

Wait, but is there a general pattern here?

It seems that whenever the sum is even, Bob wins, and when it's odd, Alice wins.

But is there a mathematical justification for this?

Let me try to think in terms of game theory.

This game is similar to the game of Nim, where players take turns removing objects from piles, and the player who can't make a move loses.

In this case, the players can choose to swap the piles (wallets) before removing a coin.

I need to see if this game can be reduced to Nim or some other known game.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a concept of "Nimbers" or "xor" operation involved in determining the winner.

But in this specific game, the ability to swap adds an extra layer of strategy.

Let me consider the game in terms of the number of coins each player has.

Let me try to find a general strategy.

Suppose that a and b are both positive integers.

Each move consists of possibly swapping the wallets and then removing one coin from the current wallet.

The game ends when a player cannot remove a coin, which happens when their current wallet has zero coins.

Given that both players play optimally, the winner can be determined based on the initial values of a and b.

Looking back at the func_1, it's simply checking if a + b is even or odd.

From the test cases I've simulated, it seems to hold.

But to be thorough, let's consider more cases.

Test case: a=3, b=3. Sum=6, even -> Bob wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=3, b=3. Swap -> a=3, b=3. Remove 1: a=2, b=3.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=3. Swap -> a=3, b=2. Remove 1: a=2, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=2. Remove 1: a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=1. Remove 1: a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=1. Remove 1: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Alternatively, if Alice doesn't swap initially:

- a=3, b=3. Remove 1: a=2, b=3.

- Bob's turn: a=2, b=3. Swap -> a=3, b=2. Remove 1: a=2, b=2.

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=2. Remove 1: a=1, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=2. Swap -> a=2, b=1. Remove 1: a=1, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=1, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=1. Remove 1: a=0, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Again, matches the func_1's output.

Another test case: a=2, b=1. Sum=3, odd -> Alice wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: a=2, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=2. Remove 1: a=0, b=2.

- Bob's turn: a=0, b=2. Can't swap, removes 1: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Alternatively, if Alice doesn't swap:

- a=2, b=1. Remove 1: a=1, b=1.

- Bob's turn: a=1, b=1. Swap -> a=1, b=1. Remove 1: a=0, b=1.

- Alice's turn: a=0, b=1. Can't swap, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

So in both choices, Alice wins.

Thus, func_1 seems correct.

Wait, but is there a general proof for this?

Let me consider the parity of a and b.

Case 1: both a and b are even.

Then a + b is even, so func_1 says Bob wins.

Case 2: one of a or b is even, the other odd. Then a + b is odd, so Alice wins.

Case 3: both a and b are odd. Then a + b is even, so Bob wins.

Is there a pattern based on the parity of a and b?

Wait, in the first test case, a=1, b=1 (both odd, sum even), Bob wins.

Second test case, a=1, b=4 (one odd, one even, sum odd), Alice wins.

Third test case, a=5, b=3 (both odd, sum even), Bob wins.

Fourth test case, a=4, b=5 (one even, one odd, sum odd), Alice wins.

Fifth test case, a=11, b=9 (both odd, sum even), Bob wins.

Sixth test case, a=83, b=91 (both odd, sum even), Bob wins.

Seventh test case, a=1032, b=9307 (one even, one odd, sum odd), Alice wins.

Eighth test case, a=839204, b=7281 (one even, one odd, sum odd), Alice wins.

Ninth test case, a=1000000000, b=1000000000 (both even, sum even), Bob wins.

Tenth test case, a=53110, b=2024 (both even, sum even), Bob wins.

So, from these observations, it seems that the sum's parity determines the winner.

But is there a mathematical justification for this?

Let me think about the game in terms of the number of moves possible.

Each move reduces the total number of coins by one, since one coin is removed each turn.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when their current wallet is empty.

The player who is faced with an empty wallet when it's their turn to play loses.

So, the total number of moves that can be made is equal to the total number of coins initially.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true, because the players can swap wallets, which might affect the total number of moves.

Wait, actually, each move reduces the total number of coins by one, because one coin is removed each turn, regardless of swapping.

So, the total number of moves is a + b.

Now, since Alice starts first, if the total number of moves is odd, Alice makes the last move and wins. If it's even, Bob makes the last move and wins.

Wait, but that can't be right, because in the first test case, a=1, b=1: sum=2 (even), Bob wins, which matches.

Second test case: a=1, b=4: sum=5 (odd), Alice wins, which matches.

Third test case: a=5, b=3: sum=8 (even), Bob wins, matches.

Fourth test case: a=4, b=5: sum=9 (odd), Alice wins, matches.

Fifth test case: a=11, b=9: sum=20 (even), Bob wins, matches.

Sixth test case: a=83, b=91: sum=174 (even), Bob wins, matches.

Seventh test case: a=1032, b=9307: sum=10339 (odd), Alice wins, matches.

Eighth test case: a=839204, b=7281: sum=846485 (odd), Alice wins, matches.

Ninth test case: a=1000000000, b=1000000000: sum=2000000000 (even), Bob wins, matches.

Tenth test case: a=53110, b=2024: sum=55134 (even), Bob wins, matches.

So, in all these cases, the sum's parity correctly predicts the winner.

Therefore, it seems that the func_1 is correct.

But to be absolutely sure, let's consider the game in more depth.

Each move consists of:

1. Choosing to swap wallets or not.

2. Removing one coin from the current wallet.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when their current wallet is empty.

Now, since swapping is an option, it adds a layer of strategy.

However, it seems that the swapping option doesn't affect the overall parity of the sum.

In other words, no matter how they swap, the total number of moves remains a + b, and the player who makes the last move wins.

Given that Alice starts first, if a + b is odd, Alice makes the last move and wins; if even, Bob makes the last move and wins.

This seems to hold for all the test cases.

Therefore, the func_1 is correct.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
