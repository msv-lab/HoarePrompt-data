Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n books, each with a certain number of pages, and she wants to divide these books into two non-empty piles. Then, she reads the book with the highest number in each pile and wants to maximize the total number of pages she reads.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. She has to divide the books into two piles, both non-empty, meaning each pile must have at least one book. Then, from each pile, she reads the book with the highest page count. My goal is to help her arrange the books in such a way that the sum of the pages of these two highest books is maximized.

Let me think about how to approach this. If I want to maximize the sum of the two highest books, one from each pile, I should probably try to put the two highest books into separate piles. That way, she reads both of them, giving me the maximum possible sum.

Wait, is that always true? Let's consider a simple example. Suppose she has two books: one with 1 page and one with 1 page. If I put each book in separate piles, she reads 1 + 1 = 2 pages. If I put them both in one pile, the highest is 1, and the other pile has none, which is invalid since both piles must have at least one book. So, the only way is to have one book per pile, and the sum is 2, which seems correct.

Another example: four books with pages 2, 3, 3, and 1. If I put the two 3's in separate piles, she reads 3 + 3 = 6 pages. But looking at the example provided, the output is 4, which is different. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem.

Looking back at the example in the problem:

Input:

5

2

1 1

4

2 3 3 1

5

2 2 3 2 2

2

10 3

3

1 2 3

Output:

2

4

5

13

5

Wait, in the second test case, with n=4 and pages [2,3,3,1], the output is 4, not 6 as I thought. So, my initial approach must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider something else. Let's read the problem again carefully.

"Alice does the following:

- She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.

- Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

"Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages she can read by dividing the books into two piles."

So, she reads the book with the highest number in each pile, and we need to maximize the sum of those two highest books, each coming from different piles.

Given that, in the second test case, the correct output is 4, not 6. So, perhaps there's a different way to interpret this.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the note provided for the second test case.

"In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages."

Wait, the books are numbered from 1 to n, but the pages are given as a list. So, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are the page counts. In the note, it says books with numbers 2 and 3 (which are pages 3 and 3) in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 (pages 2 and 1) in the second pile. Then, she reads the highest from each pile: 3 from the first pile and 2 from the second pile, summing to 5, but the output is 4. That doesn't match. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the note.

Wait, perhaps the book numbers are just identifiers, and the piles are collections of specific books, not necessarily contiguous in the list.

Let me try to rephrase: she has books 1 through n with page counts a_1 to a_n. She divides them into two non-empty piles, and from each pile, reads the book with the highest page count. We need to maximize the sum of these two highest pages.

Given that, in the second test case, n=4, pages=[2,3,3,1]. To maximize the sum, I should put the two highest books (both 3's) into separate piles, so she reads 3 + 3 = 6, but the output is 4. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe she reads the book with the highest number, meaning the book with the highest page count, but only if it's in that pile. Maybe I need to sort the pages and pick the two highest ones, ensuring they are in different piles.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=2, pages=[1,1], output is 2, which is 1+1, so that makes sense. In the second test case, n=4, pages=[2,3,3,1], output is 4, which would be 3 +1, but that's not the maximum. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe she reads the book with the highest number in terms of book index, not page count. Wait, no, the problem says "the book with the highest number in each pile." I think it's referring to the book with the highest page count in each pile.

Given that, in the second test case, the output is 4, which is 3 +1, but she could have 3 + 3 =6, which is higher. So why is the output 4?

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the problem statement again.

"Alice does the following:

- She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.

- Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

Wait, maybe "highest number" refers to the book's index, not the page count. Maybe she reads the book with the highest index in each pile.

If that's the case, then in the second test case, if she puts books 1 and 2 in one pile, and books 3 and 4 in another pile, the highest indices are book 2 (page 3) and book 4 (page 1), summing to 4, which matches the sample output.

Wait, that makes sense. So, "the book with the highest number in each pile" refers to the book with the highest index in each pile, not the one with the highest page count.

Given that, in the second test case, dividing books into pile1: books 1 and 2 (pages 2 and 3), pile2: books 3 and 4 (pages 3 and 1). Then, the book with the highest index in pile1 is book 2 (page 3), and in pile2 is book 4 (page 1), summing to 4.

Alternatively, if she puts books 1 and 3 in one pile, and books 2 and 4 in another pile, then the highest indices are book 3 (page 3) and book 4 (page 1), summing to 4 again.

Another division: books 1 and 4 in one pile, books 2 and 3 in another pile. Highest indices are book 4 (page 1) and book 3 (page 3), summing to 4.

Alternatively, books 1 in one pile, and books 2,3,4 in the other pile. Highest indices are book 1 (page 2) and book 4 (page 1), summing to 3, which is less than 4.

So, the maximum is indeed 4.

Wait, but if she puts book 2 in one pile and books 1,3,4 in another pile, then highest indices are book 2 (page 3) and book 4 (page 1), summing to 4 again.

So, in all possible divisions, the maximum sum she can achieve is 4.

But if "highest number" refers to the highest page count, then putting the two highest page counts in separate piles would give 3 + 3 =6, which is higher than 4. But according to the sample output, it's 4, so it must be that "highest number" refers to the highest index in each pile.

Therefore, the problem is to divide the books into two non-empty piles and read the book with the highest index in each pile, maximizing the sum of their page counts.

Given that, the approach should be to maximize the sum of pages of the two books with the highest indices, each in separate piles.

Wait, but indices are fixed based on input order, so I need to select two books, each in different piles, such that their page counts sum to the maximum possible.

Essentially, I need to choose two books, ensure they are in different piles, and sum their page counts, maximizing this sum.

But since the piles must be non-empty, and each book is in exactly one pile, I just need to choose which two books to select, ensuring they are in different piles.

Wait, but actually, I need to divide the books into two piles, and then read the book with the highest index in each pile, sum their pages, and maximize that sum.

So, the books are already ordered from 1 to n, and their pages are given in order.

To maximize the sum of pages of the two books with the highest indices in their respective piles.

Given that, perhaps the best way is to put the book with the highest index in one pile, and the book with the second-highest index in the other pile, and then distribute the remaining books in a way that doesn't affect the highest indices in each pile.

Wait, but the remaining books can be placed in either pile, as long as the pile containing the book with the highest index in that pile is read.

Wait, perhaps another way: the book with the highest index in each pile is fixed once the piles are divided, so to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the page counts of the two books with the highest indices in their respective piles.

Given that, perhaps I should choose which pile each high-index book goes into to maximize the sum.

Wait, maybe it's simpler: sort the pages of the books and pick the two highest pages, ensuring they are in different piles.

But in the second test case, that would be 3 and 3, summing to 6, but the sample output is 4, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the indices of the books.

Let me consider that the book with the highest index in each pile is determined by the pile's composition, and I need to maximize the sum of the pages of these two books.

Given that, perhaps I should iterate through possible divisions and calculate the sum accordingly.

But with n up to 100, and t up to 500, iterating through all possible divisions is not feasible, as it would be exponential time.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the book with the highest index in a pile is always the one with the highest index among the books in that pile.

So, for each pile, the book with the highest index is fixed based on which books are in that pile.

Wait, but I need to maximize the sum of the pages of the two books that have the highest indices in their respective piles.

Given that, perhaps I can consider all possible pairs of books that could be the highest-indexed books in their respective piles.

Then, for each such pair, ensure that the books are in different piles, and sum their pages.

Then, choose the pair with the maximum sum.

Wait, but not all pairs can be separated into two piles where one book is the highest-indexed in one pile and the other is the highest-indexed in the other pile.

For example, if one book has a higher index than the other, putting the lower-indexed book in a pile would require that all higher-indexed books are in the other pile.

Wait, perhaps I need to fix one book as the highest in one pile and the other as the highest in the other pile, and see if such a division is possible.

Given that, for two books i and j, with i < j, to be the highest-indexed in their respective piles, I need to ensure that all books between i and j are in the pile of i if j is in the other pile.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Maybe another approach: iterate through the books from the highest index to the lowest, deciding which pile to put each book in to maximize the sum.

Since the highest-indexed book in a pile is the one that will be read, I need to decide for each book whether to put it in pile A or pile B, ensuring that each pile has at least one book.

I can use dynamic programming where I keep track of whether pile A and pile B are empty or not, and the pages of the highest-indexed books in each pile.

Wait, maybe it's simpler to realize that the book with the highest index in a pile is determined by the last book added to that pile.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the piles as sequences where the highest index is the maximum index in that pile.

Given that, perhaps I can select two books, say book i and book j, with i < j, and assign book j to pile A and book i to pile B, and then assign all books between i and j based on which pile has the higher page count.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])

So, for each test case, it reads n, then reads the list of pages, and then prints the sum of the maximum page count among the first n-1 books plus the page count of the last book.

In the second test case, n=4, pages=[2,3,3,1], so max(nums[:-1]) is max([2,3,3])=3, and nums[-1]=1, so sum is 4, which matches the sample output.

In the first test case, n=2, pages=[1,1], max(nums[:-1])=1, nums[-1]=1, sum=2.

In the third test case, n=5, pages=[2,2,3,2,2], max(nums[:-1])=3, nums[-1]=2, sum=5.

In the fourth test case, n=2, pages=[10,3], max(nums[:-1])=10, nums[-1]=3, sum=13.

In the fifth test case, n=3, pages=[1,2,3], max(nums[:-1])=2, nums[-1]=3, sum=5.

All of these match the sample outputs.

So, the program seems to be correct.

But is this logic always correct?

Let's consider a case where the last book has the highest page count, and another book with a high page count is earlier.

For example, n=3, pages=[4,5,3]. According to the program, max(nums[:-1])=5, nums[-1]=3, sum=8.

But, let's see if this is achievable.

If I put book 2 (pages=5) in one pile and book 3 (pages=3) in another pile, then the highest-indexed books are book 2 and book 3, with pages 5 and 3, sum=8.

Alternatively, if I put book 1 (pages=4) and book 3 (pages=3) in one pile, and book 2 (pages=5) in another pile, then the highest-indexed books are book 3 (pages=3) and book 2 (pages=5), sum=8.

So, it seems correct.

Another test case: n=4, pages=[1,2,3,4]. According to the program, max(nums[:-1])=3, nums[-1]=4, sum=7.

Is this achievable? Yes, by putting book 3 (pages=3) in one pile and book 4 (pages=4) in another pile.

Alternatively, putting book 1 (1) and book 3 (3) in one pile, and book 2 (2) and book 4 (4) in another pile, the highest-indexed books are book 3 (3) and book 4 (4), sum=7.

So, seems correct.

Another test case: n=4, pages=[5,4,3,2]. According to the program, max(nums[:-1])=5, nums[-1]=2, sum=7.

Is this achievable? Yes, by putting book 1 (5) in one pile and book 4 (2) in another pile.

Alternatively, putting book 1 (5) and book 3 (3) in one pile, and book 2 (4) and book 4 (2) in another pile, the highest-indexed books are book 3 (3) and book 4 (2), sum=5.

But 7 is higher, so 7 is better.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Wait, but in this case, sum is 7, which is book 1 (5) and book 4 (2).

Is that allowed? Yes, because book 1 is in one pile, book 4 is in another pile, and their pages are summed.

So, it seems the program is correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
