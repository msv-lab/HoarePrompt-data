Alright, I've got this problem to solve. So, let's understand what's being asked here. I have an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on it multiple times. The operation involves choosing a subarray defined by indices l and r, computing the MEX of that subarray, and then setting all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing these operations, and I need to output the maximum sum along with a sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

First, I need to make sure I understand what MEX means. MEX stands for "minimum excludant," which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given set. For example, the MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2, because 2 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

Given that, I need to think about how to use this operation to maximize the sum of the array. Each operation allows me to set a range of elements to the MEX of that range. So, I need to strategically choose ranges and perform operations in a way that increases the values in the array as much as possible.

Constraints:

- The array length n can be up to 18, which is relatively small. This suggests that even if my solution is not the most efficient, as long as it's feasible within reasonable time limits for n=18, it should be acceptable.

- Each a_i can be up to 10^7, but since we're dealing with MEX, which is always a small non-negative integer, the actual values in the array might not be as important as their positions and the possible MEX values we can obtain from subarrays.

Given that n is small, perhaps a dynamic programming approach could be viable, where I consider all possible subarrays and their MEX values, and find an optimal sequence of operations. However, since n can be up to 18, the number of possible subarrays is manageable, but I need to ensure that my solution doesn't exceed time limits.

Looking at the provided code, it seems like there are multiple functions involved: func_1, func_2, and func_3. Func_3 seems to be the main function that reads input and calls func_2, which in turn calls recursive_maximize_sum.

Let's dive into func_2 and recursive_maximize_sum to understand what's happening.

In func_2, there's a function called recursive_maximize_sum that takes left and right indices as parameters. It seems to be a recursive function that tries to maximize the sum of the subarray from l to r.

The base case seems to be when the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the length of the subarray squared. In that case, it calls func_1 to perform operations that set the subarray to its length.

Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position, then recursively processes the left and right parts around that maximum.

Func_1 appears to be a helper function that sets a subarray to a specific value, likely the MEX of that subarray.

I need to verify if this approach correctly maximizes the sum of the array.

First, let's consider the base case in recursive_maximize_sum. It checks if the sum of the subarray from l to r is less than or equal to (r - l + 1)^2. If so, it sets the entire subarray to (r - l + 1), which is the length of the subarray.

I need to think about why this is being done. Setting all elements to the length of the subarray would make each element equal to the length, thus the sum would be (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). This seems like a way to maximize the sum for that subarray, assuming that the MEX of the subarray could be as high as the length plus one, but I need to verify this logic.

Wait, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. So, for a subarray with unique values from 0 to k, the MEX would be k+1. If I set all elements in the subarray to MEX, I'm setting them to k+1, which might or might not maximize the sum, depending on the current values.

This seems a bit unclear. Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the idea is to maximize the sum by setting subarrays to as high a value as possible using MEX, which is determined by the missing smallest non-negative integer in the subarray.

Given that n is small, maybe the optimal strategy is to consider the entire array and compute its MEX, then set the entire array to that MEX value. Repeat this process until no further improvements can be made.

But according to the provided code, it's using a recursive approach to divide the array based on the maximum value and then applying operations.

I need to think about whether this approach guarantees the maximum sum.

Let me consider some examples.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 2

a = [0, 1]

The MEX of the entire array is 2 (since 0 and 1 are present), so setting both elements to 2 would give a sum of 4, which is the maximum possible.

In the code, recursive_maximize_sum is called with l=0 and r=1.

Sum = 0 + 1 = 1

(r - l + 1)^2 = 2^2 = 4

Since 1 <= 4, it would enter the first condition, call func_1 with l=0 and r=1, set both elements to 2, and append the operation (1,2).

This matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

n = 3

a = [1, 3, 9]

Sum = 13

MEX of the entire array is 0 (since 0 is missing), but setting all to 0 would decrease the sum, which is not desirable.

Hence, in this case, no operations are performed, and the sum remains 13.

In the code, sum=13 > (3)^2=9, so it wouldn't enter the first condition.

It would find the maximum value, which is 9 at position 2.

Then, it would recursively process l=0 to pos-1=1, and l=pos+1=3 to r=2, but since pos+1=3 > r=2, nothing happens.

Hence, no operations are performed, which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

n=4

a=[1,100,2,1]

After first operation: set a[3:3] to MEX(2), which is 0, so a becomes [1,100,0,1]

Then, set a[3:4] to MEX(0,1), which is 2, so a becomes [1,100,2,2]

Sum=105, which matches the sample output.

In the code, recursive_maximize_sum is called with l=0 and r=3.

Sum=1+100+2+1=104 > (4)^2=16, so it doesn't enter the first condition.

It finds the maximum value 100 at position 1.

Then, it recursively processes l=0 to pos-1=0, and l=pos+1=2 to r=3.

For l=0 to r=0: sum=1 <=1^2=1, so set a[0] to 1, append (1,1)

For l=2 to r=3: sum=2+1=3 <=2^2=4, so set a[2] and a[3] to 2, append (3,4)

Hence, operations are (3,3) and (3,4), which matches the sample output.

Seems like the code is correctly generating the operations.

Another sample input:

n=1

a=[0]

MEX is 1, set the single element to 1, sum=1, which matches the sample output.

In the code, sum=0 <=1^2=1, so set a[0] to 1, append (1,1)

Hence, it's correct.

From these observations, it seems like the approach in the code is working for the sample inputs.

But I need to think about whether this approach is generally correct.

The strategy seems to be:

- If the sum of a subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length, set the entire subarray to its length.

- Otherwise, find the maximum value in the subarray, and recursively process the left and right parts around it.

I need to understand why this works.

First, setting a subarray to its length when sum <= length^2 seems beneficial because sum becomes length^2, which is potentially higher than the current sum.

But is this always the case?

Wait, in the first sample input, sum was 1 and length^2 was 4, so setting to 2's gives sum 4, which is better.

In the second sample input, sum was 13 and length^2 was 9, so no operation is performed, which is correct because performing any operation would decrease the sum.

In the third sample input, sum was 104 and length^2 was 16, so it didn't set the entire array, but processed parts of it.

By setting a[3:3] to 0 (which is MEX of [2]), then to 2 (MEX of [0,1]), achieving sum 105, which is better than the original sum.

Seems like it works, but I need to think about whether this is optimal in general.

Is there a case where this approach doesn't maximize the sum?

Let me try to think of a counterexample.

Consider n=3

a=[0,1,2]

Sum=3 <=3^2=9

According to the code, set the entire array to 3's, sum=9

But MEX of [0,1,2] is 3, so setting to 3's is correct.

Another case:

n=3

a=[0,1,3]

MEX is 2, since 2 is missing.

Setting to 2's would give sum=6, which is better than the original sum=4.

According to the code, sum=4 <=9, so it would set the entire array to 3's, sum=9, which is incorrect.

Wait, that's wrong. MEX is 2, not 3.

Wait, MEX is the smallest missing non-negative integer, so in [0,1,3], 2 is missing, so MEX=2.

But according to the code, it sets the array to the length, which is 3, sum=9.

But MEX is 2, so setting to 2's would give sum=6, which is less than 9.

But according to the problem, we can set to MEX of the subarray, which is 2, but the code sets to the length, which is 3.

Is this correct?

Wait, can we set to MEX, which is 2, but the code sets to the length, which is 3.

Is setting to 3 valid?

Wait, perhaps there's confusion here.

The code sets the subarray to its length, but MEX is defined based on the current values in the subarray.

In this case, setting to 3 would require that 3 is the MEX of some subarray.

But in [0,1,3], MEX is 2, not 3.

Wait, MEX is 2, because 2 is the smallest missing non-negative integer.

But if I set the subarray to 3's, I need to ensure that 3 is the MEX of that subarray.

But in [0,1,3], MEX is 2, so I can't set it to 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

The operation allows me to choose a subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements in that subarray to that MEX.

So, for [0,1,3], MEX is 2, so I can set the entire array to 2's, sum=6.

But the code sets it to 3's, sum=9, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the code has a mistake here.

Looking back at the code, in func_1, it sets the subarray to r - l + 1, which is the length.

But in the example above, for n=3, a=[0,1,3], sum=4 <=9, so it sets a to [3,3,3], but MEX was 2, not 3.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify how MEX is calculated in this scenario.

Given subarray [0,1,3], MEX is 2, so I can set all elements to 2.

But the code sets them to 3, which is not equal to the MEX.

This seems like an error in the code.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the provided sample inputs, it seemed to work.

Wait, in the first sample input, n=2, a=[0,1], MEX=2, set to [2,2], sum=4, which is correct.

In the second sample input, n=3, a=[1,3,9], sum=13 >9, so no operation is performed, which is correct.

In the third sample input, n=4, a=[1,100,2,1], operations are performed to set a[3] to 0 (MEX of [2]), then a[3:4] to 2 (MEX of [0,1]), achieving sum=105, which is correct.

But in the counterexample I thought of, n=3, a=[0,1,3], sum=4 <=9, so set to [3,3,3], but MEX is 2, not 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how MEX is computed after setting.

Wait, no, the operation is to compute MEX of the current subarray and set all elements to that MEX.

So, in [0,1,3], MEX=2, so I can set all elements to 2.

But the code sets them to 3, which is incorrect because 3 is not the MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the definition again.

Wait, maybe I'm misremembering how MEX is used in the operation.

The operation is:

- Choose l and r (1 <= l <= r <= n)

- Compute x = MEX of a_l to a_r

- Set a_l to a_r to x

So, in [0,1,3], MEX is 2, so x=2, set a to [2,2,2], sum=6

But the code sets a to [3,3,3], sum=9, which is invalid because MEX was 2, not 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the code.

In func_1, it sets the subarray to r - l + 1, which is the length.

But in reality, x should be MEX of the subarray, which may not be equal to the length.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is False.

Wait, but in the first sample input, it worked because MEX=2 and length=2.

In the third sample input, it worked because after setting a[3] to 0 (MEX of [2]), then a[3:4] to 2 (MEX of [0,1]), achieving sum=105.

But in the counterexample, it doesn't work.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to fix the code.

Maybe instead of setting to r - l + 1, it should set to MEX of the subarray.

But computing MEX for each subarray operation can be time-consuming, but since n is small, it's manageable.

But in the code, func_1 sets the subarray to r - l + 1, which is not necessarily equal to the MEX.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is False.

**Final Solution**

    s = set(arr)
    mex = 0
    while mex in s:
        mex += 1

    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = compute_mex([a[l]])
        return
    x = compute_mex(a[l:r+1])
    if a[l] != x:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = x
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            subarr = a[i:j+1]
            mex = compute_mex(subarr)
            if sum(subarr) < mex * (j - i + 1):
                ops.append((i, j))
                for k in range(i, j + 1):
                    a[k] = mex
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()
```
