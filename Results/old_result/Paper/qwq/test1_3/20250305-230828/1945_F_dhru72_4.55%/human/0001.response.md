Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Kirill wants to pick mushrooms to make an elixir. Each mushroom has a magic power, and there are n mushrooms in total. The strength of the elixir is the product of the number of mushrooms used and the minimum magic power among those mushrooms. So, if he picks k mushrooms, the strength is k times the smallest magic power among those k mushrooms.

But there's a catch: there's a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, and if Kirill picks k mushrooms, the magic power of the mushrooms with indices p_1 through p_{k-1} becomes zero. He can't use mushrooms with zero magic power in his elixir.

My task is to help Kirill pick mushrooms in such a way that he maximizes the elixir's strength, and among all options that give this maximum strength, choose the one with the minimum number of mushrooms.

First, I need to understand the permutation p and how it affects the magic powers.

Let's think about what happens when Kirill picks k mushrooms. The magic powers of the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p become zero. So, the mushrooms with indices p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

Kirill can't use these mushrooms in his elixir because their magic power is zero. So, the only mushrooms he can use are those with indices p_k to p_n, but only the ones he actually picks.

Wait, no. The problem says that he picks k mushrooms sequentially, meaning he picks the first k mushrooms in some order, but the permutation p determines which mushrooms have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0." And he won't use mushrooms with zero magic power.

So, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero, and he can't use them.

But he picks k mushrooms, so he must choose which k mushrooms to pick, but the order in which he picks them affects which mushrooms have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, I need to be careful here.

Let's think differently. Suppose Kirill picks mushrooms in a certain order, and the permutation p determines the order in which the magic powers are set to zero.

Actually, the problem says: "the permutation p of numbers from 1 to n. If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, it's not about the order he picks them, but rather, picking k mushrooms means that the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, no. If he picks k mushrooms, then the mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

So, the mushrooms with indices p_1 to p_{k-1} have v set to 0.

Then, Kirill will use the remaining mushrooms he picks, but only those that still have a positive magic power.

Wait, no. He can only use the mushrooms he picks that still have positive magic power after setting the first k-1 mushrooms in p to zero.

Wait, but he picks k mushrooms, and the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their v set to zero.

But he can only use the mushrooms he picks that still have positive v.

So, among the k mushrooms he picks, some of them might have their v set to zero based on their position in p.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of choosing which k mushrooms to pick, and based on that k, determine which mushrooms have v set to zero.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the permutation p determines the order in which mushrooms are considered for zeroing.

So, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their v set to zero, and then he can use the remaining mushrooms he picks that haven't had their v set to zero.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the permutation p determines the order in which mushrooms are considered, and picking k mushrooms means that the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their v set to zero, and then he picks the k-th mushroom in p.

But the problem says: "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

And he can't use mushrooms with zero magic power.

So, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have v set to zero, and he can't use them.

Therefore, among the k mushrooms he picks, only the k-th mushroom in p has its v unchanged, assuming he picks it.

Wait, but he can pick any k mushrooms, not necessarily the first k in p.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that when he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their v set to zero, and he can't use those.

So, the only mushrooms he can use are those not among p_1 to p_{k-1}, and among the k mushrooms he picks.

So, he can only use the mushrooms he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p is a permutation, so it includes all mushrooms from 1 to n.

So, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 positions in p have their v set to zero, and he can't use those.

Therefore, the only mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p_k might be among the k mushrooms he picks.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of excluding the first k-1 mushrooms in p.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that the k-th mushroom he picks is p_k, and the first k-1 have v set to zero.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Kirill picks k mushrooms. Then, the magic power of mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} is set to zero.

He can only use the mushrooms he picks that still have positive magic power, i.e., those not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but p is a permutation, so p_1 to p_{k-1} are the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation.

So, when he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their v set to zero.

Therefore, among the k mushrooms he picks, only those not among p_1 to p_{k-1} can be used.

But, since p is a permutation, p_k is the k-th mushroom in the permutation.

So, if he picks k mushrooms, including p_k, then p_k has its v unchanged, and the others he picks have v set to zero if they are among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, this seems too tangled.

Perhaps I need to consider that the permutation p determines the order in which the magic powers are zeroed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate over possible k and find the best elixir strength.

Let me consider that for each k from 1 to n, I can compute the strength of the elixir if Kirill picks k mushrooms.

Given that, for each k, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have v set to zero.

Then, Kirill can pick any k mushrooms, but only those not among p_1 to p_{k-1} have positive v.

Wait, but p is a permutation, so p_k is the k-th mushroom.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that when picking k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have v set to zero, and then he picks k mushrooms, so he can pick any k mushrooms, but only those not among p_1 to p_{k-1} have positive v.

Wait, but p_k might be among the k mushrooms he picks.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the k mushrooms he picks include p_k, and the others he picks have their v set to zero if they are among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix k, the number of mushrooms he picks.

Then, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have v set to zero.

So, the only mushrooms that can be used are those not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Therefore, the set of mushrooms he can use is the set difference between all mushrooms and p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Then, among these remaining mushrooms, he picks k mushrooms, but since p_1 to p_{k-1} have v set to zero, he can only use the mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but if he picks k mushrooms, and the first k-1 in p have v set to zero, then the mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, the number of mushrooms he can use is k minus the number of mushrooms among the k he picks that are in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but if he picks k mushrooms, and p_1 to p_{k-1} have v set to zero, then only the mushrooms he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1} have positive v.

Therefore, the number of mushrooms he can use is k - (number of mushrooms in his pick that are among p_1 to p_{k-1}).

But this seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that for a given k, the strength of the elixir is k times the minimum v among the mushrooms he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but v of p_1 to p_{k-1} are set to zero, so the minimum v among the picked mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1} is the minimum v among the picked mushrooms excluding p_1 to p_{k-1}.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I need to consider that the mushrooms he can use are those not among p_1 to p_{k-1}, and he picks k mushrooms, so the number of usable mushrooms is k minus the number of picked mushrooms that are among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, the number of usable mushrooms is k - (number of picked mushrooms that are among p_1 to p_{k-1}).

Let me denote S_k = p_1 to p_{k-1}, the set of mushrooms that have v set to zero when picking k mushrooms.

Then, the mushrooms he picks are a subset of size k from all mushrooms.

Among these k, the ones not in S_k have positive v.

Therefore, the number of mushrooms he can use is k - |pick ∩ S_k|.

And the strength is (k - |pick ∩ S_k|) * min_v, where min_v is the smallest v among the mushrooms he can use.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to find a better way to model this.

Let me consider reordering the mushrooms according to the permutation p.

Let me sort the mushrooms according to the order in p.

So, p_1 to p_n is the order in which the magic powers are zeroed.

So, if Kirill picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their v set to zero.

Therefore, in the sorted order, the first k-1 mushrooms have v set to zero.

Then, Kirill picks k mushrooms, so he can pick any k mushrooms, but only those not among the first k-1 in p have positive v.

Wait, but in this sorted order, the first k-1 mushrooms have v set to zero.

Therefore, the mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are not among the first k-1 in p.

So, in other words, for each k, the mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are after the first k-1 in p.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each k, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have v set to zero, and he picks k mushrooms, so he can only use the mushrooms he picks that are not among the first k-1 in p.

Therefore, the number of mushrooms he can use is k - (number of picked mushrooms that are among the first k-1 in p).

Wait, this seems similar to what I had before.

Maybe I need to consider that the set of usable mushrooms is the intersection of the picked mushrooms and the mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, the strength is (number of mushrooms in pick ∩ (not S_k)) * min_v, where min_v is the smallest v among the mushrooms in pick ∩ (not S_k).

This still seems complicated.

Perhaps I need to iterate over k and find the maximum strength possible.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that for each k, the strength is k times the minimum v among the mushrooms he can use.

Given that the first k-1 mushrooms in p have v set to zero, the mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are not among the first k-1 in p.

So, to maximize the strength, I need to maximize k times the minimum v among the mushrooms he picks that are not among the first k-1 in p.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to consider that the mushrooms he can use are those not among p_1 to p_{k-1}, and he picks k mushrooms.

Wait, but p is a permutation, so p_k to p_n are the mushrooms that haven't had their v set to zero when picking k mushrooms.

Wait, p_1 to p_{k-1} have v set to zero, and p_k to p_n have their v unchanged.

Therefore, the mushrooms he can use are those among p_k to p_n that he picks.

So, the number of mushrooms he can use is the number of picked mushrooms that are among p_k to p_n.

And the strength is (number of picked mushrooms among p_k to p_n) times the smallest v among those picked mushrooms.

Wait, this seems promising.

So, for each k, he picks k mushrooms, and the number of picked mushrooms among p_k to p_n is k minus (number of picked mushrooms among p_1 to p_{k-1}).

Let me denote that as:

Usable mushrooms = k - (number of picked mushrooms among p_1 to p_{k-1}).

And the strength is Usable mushrooms * min_v, where min_v is the smallest v among the usable mushrooms.

Wait, but min_v is the smallest v among the usable mushrooms, which are among p_k to p_n.

Wait, but p_k to p_n have their v unchanged.

So, the smallest v among the usable mushrooms is the smallest v among the picked mushrooms that are among p_k to p_n.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that the usable mushrooms are the picked mushrooms among p_k to p_n.

So, the strength is (number of picked mushrooms among p_k to p_n) * min_v, where min_v is the smallest v among the picked mushrooms among p_k to p_n.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate over k and find the maximum strength possible.

But this seems inefficient for n up to 2e5.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for a given k, the strength is k times the smallest v among the picked mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for a given k, the strength is k times the smallest v among the picked mushrooms excluding p_1 to p_{k-1}.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think in terms of choosing the k-th mushroom in p and ensuring that the smallest v is maximized.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the mushrooms in decreasing order of v and try to pick as many as possible without including too many from p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, maybe I should sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of v and try to pick the top m mushrooms such that the number of them in p_1 to p_{k-1} is less than m.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the smallest v in the picked mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Then, I need to maximize k times this v.

So, for a given v, I need to find the maximum k such that among the picked mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, the smallest v is at least v.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate over possible v and find the maximum k for which I can pick k mushrooms with at least m mushrooms having v at least v, where m is k minus the number of picked mushrooms in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that for a given k, the strength is k times the smallest v among the picked mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

To maximize this, I need to choose k and the picked mushrooms such that this product is maximized.

This seems too vague for an algorithm.

Perhaps I need to consider that the permutation p determines the order in which the mushrooms are zeroed, and I need to pick k mushrooms such that the first k-1 in p are zeroed, and I pick the k-th one with the highest possible v.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the strength is k times the smallest v among the picked mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for a given k, I need to pick k mushrooms, and the strength is k times the smallest v among the picked mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of v and try to pick the top m mushrooms, ensuring that the number of them in p_1 to p_{k-1} is less than m.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me consider an example to understand better.

Take the first sample input:

3

9 8 14

3 2 1

So, n=3, v=[9,8,14], p=[3,2,1]

So, p_1=3, p_2=2, p_3=1

So, if k=1, then the first k-1=0 mushrooms have v set to zero, so none are zeroed.

He picks 1 mushroom, and can use it if it's not among p_1 to p_0, which is none.

So, he can use the mushroom he picks.

So, strength = 1 * min_v, where min_v is the v of the picked mushroom.

To maximize, he should pick the mushroom with the highest v, which is 14.

So, strength = 14.

But in the sample output, it's 16 with 2 mushrooms.

So, something's wrong with this approach.

Wait, perhaps I misread the permutation.

Wait, p is 3,2,1, meaning p_1=3, p_2=2, p_3=1.

So, if k=2, then the first k-1=1 mushroom, p_1=3, has v set to zero.

So, v[3-1]=v[2]=8 is set to zero.

Now, he picks 2 mushrooms.

The mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}, which is p_1=3.

So, mushroom 3 has v set to zero, so he can't use it.

Therefore, among the 2 mushrooms he picks, only those not including mushroom 3 can be used.

Wait, but p_1=3 corresponds to v[2]=8, which is set to zero.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, they pick mushrooms 1 and 2, so v[0]=9 and v[1]=8.

But v[1]=8 is set to zero because p_1=3 corresponds to v[2]=8.

Wait, no, p is the permutation of indices, so p_1=3 means the third mushroom, which is v[2]=14.

Wait, maybe I need to be careful with 0-indexing vs 1-indexing.

In Python, lists are 0-indexed, but the problem describes 1-indexed permutation.

So, p_1=3 means the third mushroom, which is v[2]=14.

So, if k=2, then p_1=3 has v set to zero.

So, v[2]=14 is set to zero.

Then, he picks 2 mushrooms, but can't use the one with v=14.

So, he can only use the mushrooms he picks that are not p_1 to p_{k-1}, which is p_1=3.

So, he can only use mushrooms 1 and 2.

But v[2]=14 is set to zero, so he can only use mushroom 1 with v=9.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, they pick mushrooms 1 and 2, so v=9 and v=8, but v=8 is set to zero, so only v=9 is used.

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, strength is 2 * min(9,8)=16.

But according to my reasoning, only v=9 can be used, since v=8 is set to zero.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

"Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, when picking k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their v set to zero, and he can't use them.

Therefore, the mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

In the sample input:

n=3

v=[9,8,14]

p=[3,2,1]

So, p_1=3, p_2=2, p_3=1

So, if k=2, then p_1=3 has v set to zero, so v[2]=14 is set to zero.

He picks 2 mushrooms, say mushrooms 1 and 2.

Among them, mushroom 3 has v set to zero, but he didn't pick mushroom 3.

Wait, p_1=3 corresponds to mushroom 3, which has v=14 set to zero.

But he picks mushrooms 1 and 2, so v=9 and v=8.

Since p_1=3 is set to zero, but he didn't pick mushroom 3, so both v=9 and v=8 are usable.

So, strength = 2 * min(9,8)=16.

Wait, but according to the problem, p_1=3 is set to zero, but since he didn't pick mushroom 3, v=14 is set to zero, but he didn't pick it, so it doesn't affect his elixir.

Wait, no, the problem says "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

And "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

But in the sample explanation, they pick mushrooms 1 and 2, and p_1=3 is set to zero, but since they didn't pick mushroom 3, it doesn't affect them.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, they say that the magic power of mushroom 3 becomes zero after picking two mushrooms.

But since they didn't pick mushroom 3, it doesn't affect their elixir.

So, in this case, they pick mushrooms 1 and 2, with v=9 and v=8, and the strength is 2 * min(9,8)=16.

Wait, but according to the problem, "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, for k=2, p_1=3 is set to zero.

But since they didn't pick mushroom 3, it doesn't affect their elixir.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, if a mushroom has v set to zero, he can't use it, even if he didn't pick it.

Wait, but in this case, mushroom 3 has v set to zero, but since he didn't pick it, it doesn't affect his elixir.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that only the picked mushrooms that have v set to zero can't be used.

Wait, no, the problem says "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, he can't use any mushroom with v set to zero, whether he picked it or not.

But in the sample explanation, they pick mushrooms 1 and 2, and mushroom 3 has v set to zero, but since they didn't pick mushroom 3, it doesn't affect their elixir.

Wait, perhaps I need to confirm the problem statement again.

"the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

"Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, the mushrooms with indices p_1 to p_{k-1} have their v set to zero, and Kirill can't use any mushroom with v=0.

Therefore, among the mushrooms he picks, if any of them are among p_1 to p_{k-1}, their v is set to zero, and he can't use them.

So, the mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

In the sample input, for k=2, p_1=3 has v set to zero.

He picks mushrooms 1 and 2.

Since neither is among p_1 to p_{k-1}=p_1=3, both have positive v, so he can use both.

Thus, strength=2*min(9,8)=16.

Wait, but according to the problem, p_1=3 has v set to zero, but since he didn't pick mushroom 3, it doesn't affect his elixir.

Wait, but according to the problem, "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, even if he doesn't pick them, their v is set to zero.

But "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, he can't use any mushroom with v=0, even if he didn't pick it.

But in the sample explanation, they pick mushrooms 1 and 2, and mushroom 3 has v set to zero, but since they didn't pick mushroom 3, it doesn't affect their elixir.

Wait, perhaps I need to confirm the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0."

And "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

So, the mushrooms with indices p_1 to p_{k-1} have v set to zero, and Kirill can't use them in his elixir.

But in the sample explanation, they pick mushrooms 1 and 2, and p_1=3 corresponds to mushroom 3, which has v set to zero, but since they didn't pick mushroom 3, it doesn't affect their elixir.

Wait, perhaps I need to think that only the picked mushrooms that are among p_1 to p_{k-1} have v set to zero.

Wait, no, the problem says "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1 to p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, regardless of whether he picks them or not, their v is set to zero.

But Kirill can't use any mushroom with v=0 in his elixir.

Therefore, among the mushrooms he picks, if any are among p_1 to p_{k-1}, their v is zero, and he can't use them.

So, the mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

In the sample input, for k=2, p_1=3 has v set to zero.

He picks mushrooms 1 and 2.

Neither is among p_1 to p_{k-1}=p_1=3, so both have positive v, and he can use both.

Thus, strength=2*min(9,8)=16.

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, they pick mushrooms 1 and 2, and the strength is 2*min(9,8)=16.

But according to the problem, the magic power of mushroom 3 is set to zero, but since he didn't pick it, it doesn't affect his elixir.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that only the picked mushrooms that are among p_1 to p_{k-1} have v set to zero.

Wait, but the problem says "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1 to p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, all mushrooms with indices p_1 to p_{k-1} have v set to zero, regardless of whether they are picked or not.

Then, Kirill can't use any mushroom with v=0 in his elixir.

Therefore, among the mushrooms he picks, if any are among p_1 to p_{k-1}, their v is zero, and he can't use them.

So, the mushrooms he can use are those he picks that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Hence, for k=2, p_1=3 has v set to zero.

He picks mushrooms 1 and 2.

Neither is among p_1 to p_{k-1}=p_1=3, so both have positive v, and he can use both.

Thus, strength=2*min(9,8)=16.

Similarly, for k=1, p_1 to p_{0}=none, so no v is set to zero.

He picks 1 mushroom, say mushroom 1 with v=9.

Strength=1*9=9.

For k=3, p_1 and p_2=3 and 2 have v set to zero.

He picks 3 mushrooms: 1,2,3 with v=9,0,0.

He can only use mushroom 1 with v=9.

Strength=1*9=9.

So, the maximum strength is 16 with k=2.

This matches the sample output.

So, now I need to generalize this.

Given n, v, and p, I need to find k and the set of k mushrooms to pick such that the strength is maximized, and among those, choose the smallest k.

Constraints are n up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but sum of n over t is up to 2e5.

So, per test case, time complexity should be O(n log n).

Now, how to approach this.

I need to maximize k * min_v, where min_v is the smallest v among the picked mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, for a given k, p_1 to p_{k-1} have v set to zero.

Then, among the picked k mushrooms, the ones not among p_1 to p_{k-1} have positive v.

So, the number of usable mushrooms is k - (number of picked mushrooms among p_1 to p_{k-1}).

And the strength is this number times the smallest v among these usable mushrooms.

To maximize this, I need to choose k and the picked mushrooms accordingly.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to iterate over possible k and find the maximum strength for each k.

But n is up to 2e5, so I need an efficient way.

Perhaps I can sort the v in decreasing order and process accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can sort the v in decreasing order and assign the largest v to the mushrooms that are least likely to be zeroed.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a given k, the strength is k times the smallest v among the picked mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, to maximize this, I need to maximize k * min_v.

I need to choose k and the picked mushrooms such that min_v is as large as possible for that k.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the v in decreasing order and select the top m mushrooms, ensuring that the number of them among p_1 to p_{k-1} is minimized.

But I need to find k and m accordingly.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that for a given k, the smallest v among the picked mushrooms not among p_1 to p_{k-1} is the smallest v among the picked mushrooms excluding p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, perhaps I can sort the v in decreasing order and select the top k mushrooms, excluding p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for a given k, the smallest v among the picked mushrooms not among p_1 to p_{k-1} is the smallest v among the picked mushrooms excluding p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, maybe I need to iterate over k from n downto 1, and keep track of the smallest v among the mushrooms not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the v in decreasing order and build a data structure to keep track of the number of mushrooms not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the v in decreasing order.

Then, I can try to pick the top m mushrooms, and for each m, find the smallest k such that m <= k - (number of top m mushrooms among p_1 to p_{k-1}).

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate m from 1 to n and find the smallest k such that m <= k - (number of top m mushrooms among p_1 to p_{k-1}).

Then, for each m, compute k_min = m + (number of top m mushrooms among p_1 to p_{k-1}).

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that for a given m, the number of top m mushrooms among p_1 to p_{k-1} is the number of top m mushrooms whose p_i < k.

Wait, perhaps I need to map each mushroom to its position in p.

So, for each mushroom, its position in p is its p_i.

Then, for the top m mushrooms, I need to find the number of them with p_i < k.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the v in decreasing order and keep track of their p_i.

Then, for a given k, the number of top m mushrooms with p_i < k is the number of top m mushrooms among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for a given m, I need to find the smallest k such that the number of top m mushrooms with p_i < k is less than or equal to k - m.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that for a given m, the number of
