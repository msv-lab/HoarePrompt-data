Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n+1. He doesn't like waiting, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue. To do that, he can bribe people ahead of him to swap places.

Each person in the queue has two values: a_i and b_i. If Kirill is at position i and wants to swap with someone at position j (where j < i), he has to pay a_j to that person. Additionally, for everyone between j and i (excluding j and i), he has to pay b_k to each of them.

My task is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people.

First, I need to understand the operations Kirill can perform. He can choose any position j that is ahead of him (j < i) and swap with that person, paying a_j to that person and b_k to everyone between j and i.

I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move from position n+1 to some position between 1 and m.

Let me think about this step by step.

Starting from position n+1, Kirill wants to move forward to position m or better. He can perform swaps with anyone ahead of him, but he has to pay certain costs associated with those swaps.

I need to model this as some kind of optimization problem, probably using dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, considering the costs involved in each move.

Let me consider the positions in the queue as indices from 1 to n+1, where position 1 is the front of the queue, and position n+1 is where Kirill starts.

I need to find a sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost and gets Kirill to a position <= m.

This seems a bit complex. Maybe I can think of it differently.

Let's consider that Kirill can jump over multiple people at once by choosing to swap with someone who is not immediately in front of him. Each such swap has a cost based on a_j and the sum of b_k for those in between.

I need to find the cheapest way to move from position n+1 to position m or less.

This sounds like a shortest path problem, where positions are nodes, and swaps are edges with associated costs.

In such a graph, positions are from 1 to n+1, and Kirill starts at n+1 and wants to reach any position from 1 to m.

Each possible swap from i to j (j < i) creates an edge from i to j with a cost of a_j plus the sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimum cost path from n+1 to any node <= m.

But building such a graph explicitly would be inefficient because n can be up to 200,000, and t can be up to 10,000.

So, I need a smarter way to compute this without building a graph.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a way to compute the minimum cost incrementally.

Perhaps I can consider moving from position n+1 to position m in stages, always choosing the cheapest possible move at each step.

But I'm not sure if a greedy approach would work here because the costs depend on both a_j and the sum of b_k for intermediate positions.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n+1.

I need to compute dp[i] for all i from 1 to m and then take the minimum among them.

Now, how to compute dp[i].

To reach position i, Kirill can come from any position j > i by swapping with the person at position j.

The cost of such a swap is a_i (since j > i, and swapping j with i would require paying a_j, but wait, no.

Wait, in the problem, it says: Kirill is at position i and chooses j < i, then he pays a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

Wait, but in my earlier notation, positions are from 1 to n+1, with 1 being the front.

But in the problem, people are numbered from 1 to n, and Kirill is at position n+1.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust my notation.

Let me redefine positions: position 1 is the front, position 2 is behind position 1, ..., position n is behind position n-1, and Kirill is at position n+1.

He wants to reach position <= m.

He can swap with anyone ahead of him, i.e., anyone from position 1 to position i-1.

When he swaps with position j < i, he pays a_j and sum of b_k for j < k < i.

Wait, no: the problem says: he chooses j < i, pays a_j, and pays b_k for all k such that j < k < i.

So, in terms of positions, if Kirill is at position i, and swaps with position j < i, he pays a_j and sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

After the swap, Kirill is at position j, and the person who was at j moves to position i.

But Kirill can perform this operation any number of times.

I need to model this in a way that allows me to compute the minimum cost to reach any position <= m.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think of it as moving left in the queue, and the cost to move from i to j is a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimal cost to go from n+1 to any position <= m.

This seems like a graph where each position is a node, and there are directed edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

I need to find the minimal cost path from n+1 to any node <= m.

But building such a graph is not feasible due to the large n.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the cumulative sums.

Let's define prefix sums of b_k, say prefix[i] = sum of b_k from 1 to i.

Then, sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix[i-1] - prefix[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j].

Therefore, cost[i][j] = a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

Simplify: a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

I need to see if I can optimize this.

Let me think about this differently.

Suppose I fix the target position j, and I want to find the minimal cost to reach j from n+1.

I need to consider all possible paths from n+1 to j and choose the one with the minimal cost.

But again, this seems too slow for large n.

Maybe I can find a way to compute dp[j], the minimal cost to reach j, by considering only direct swaps to j from positions > j.

So, dp[j] = min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k)

But this still seems too slow because for each j, I need to consider all i > j.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider processing positions from n+1 down to 1, computing the minimal cost to reach each position.

Define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i.

I need to compute dp[i] for i from 1 to m and then take the minimal among them.

Initialize dp[n+1] = 0, since Kirill starts there without paying any cost.

For i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = min over j from i+1 to n+1 of (dp[j] + a_i + sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k)

Wait, but sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k is the sum of b_k between i and j.

This seems similar to the previous formulation.

This is still O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 200,000.

I need a way to compute this more efficiently.

Let me see if I can find a way to compute dp[i] in O(1) or O(log n) time.

Maybe I can find a way to maintain some kind of prefix sum or use a segment tree.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the terms.

Let me look back at the cost to swap from j to i:

cost = a_i + sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k

I need to find, for each i, the minimal dp[j] + a_i + sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k over j > i.

This seems tricky.

Let me see if I can rearrange the sum.

sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k = sum_{k=1}^{j-1} b_k - sum_{k=1}^{i} b_k

Let’s define prefix[i] = sum_{k=1}^{i} b_k

Then, sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k = prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]

So, cost to swap from j to i is a_i + prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]

Therefore, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_i + prefix[j-1] - prefix[i])

But a_i is independent of j, so:

dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix[j-1]) - prefix[i]

Let me define a term:

let’s say, for each j > i, dp[j] + prefix[j-1]

Then, min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix[j-1])

So, dp[i] = a_i + min_{j > i} (dp[j] + prefix[j-1]) - prefix[i]

Now, if I can compute min_{j > i} (dp[j] + prefix[j-1]) efficiently, I can compute dp[i].

This seems promising.

I can maintain a minimum over a suffix.

So, if I process i from n down to 1, I can maintain a variable that keeps track of the minimum of dp[j] + prefix[j-1] for j > i.

I can initialize min_val = dp[n+1] + prefix[n]

Then, for i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + min_val - prefix[i]

if i < n:

if dp[i+1] + prefix[i] < min_val:

min_val = dp[i+1] + prefix[i]

elif i == n:

min_val = dp[n+1] + prefix[n]

Wait, but dp[n+1] should be 0, since Kirill starts there with no cost.

Wait, actually, dp[n+1] should be 0.

So, for i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i + min_val - prefix[i]

if i < n:

if dp[i+1] + prefix[i] < min_val:

min_val = dp[i+1] + prefix[i]

elif i == n:

min_val = dp[n+1] + prefix[n]

But dp[n+1] is 0.

So, dp[i] = a_i + min_val - prefix[i]

where min_val is the minimum of dp[j] + prefix[j-1] for j > i.

Yes, this seems correct.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first sample input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

prefix = [4, 4+3=7, 7+8=15, 15+5=20]

So, prefix[0]=4, prefix[1]=7, prefix[2]=15, prefix[3]=20

Initialize dp[5] = 0 (position n+1)

min_val = dp[5] + prefix[4] = 0 + 20 = 20

Now, for i=4:

dp[4] = a[4] + min_val - prefix[4-1] = 9 + 20 - 15 = 14

Then, since i=4 < n=4, no update to min_val

For i=3:

dp[3] = a[3] + min_val - prefix[3-1] = 6 + 20 - 7 = 19

Compare dp[4] + prefix[3] = 14 + 15 = 29

Since 19 < 29, min_val = 19

For i=2:

dp[2] = a[2] + min_val - prefix[2-1] = 3 + 19 - 4 = 24 -4=20

Compare dp[3] + prefix[2] = 19 + 15 = 34

Since 20 < 34, min_val = 20

For i=1:

dp[1] = a[1] + min_val - prefix[1-1] = 7 + 20 - 0 = 27

Compare dp[2] + prefix[1] = 20 + 7 = 27

Since 20 +7 =27, which is not less than 27, min_val remains 20

Then, the minimal dp[i] for i from 1 to m=2 is min(dp[1], dp[2]) = min(27,20)=20

But in the sample output, it's 14.

Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I have a mistake in the dp formulation.

Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I misindexed the arrays.

In Python, lists are 0-indexed, but in the problem, positions are 1-indexed.

Maybe that's where the confusion is.

Let me try reindexing.

Let me consider positions from 1 to n+1.

Define prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = b[1]

prefix[2] = b[1] + b[2]

...

prefix[n] = b[1] + ... + b[n]

Then, sum from k=i+1 to j-1 is prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]

In the dp formula:

dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix[j-1]) - prefix[i]

Yes, that seems correct.

In the sample input:

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=4

prefix[2]=4+3=7

prefix[3]=7+8=15

prefix[4]=15+5=20

Initialize dp[5]=0

min_val = dp[5] + prefix[4] = 0 + 20 = 20

For i=4:

dp[4] = a[4] + min_val - prefix[4-1] = 9 + 20 - 15 = 14

Then, since i=4 < n=4, no update to min_val

Wait, n=4, i=4 < n+1=5, so yes, no update.

Wait, n=4, positions are 1 to 5.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that positions are from 1 to n+1, with n+1 being Kirill's starting position.

I need to compute dp[i] for i from 1 to m.

dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix[j-1]) - prefix[i]

Wait, in the sample input, dp[4]=14, dp[3]=6 + min(dp[4]+prefix[3])=6 + 14 + 15=35, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps it should be dp[j] + prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]

So, dp[i] = a_i + min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix[j-1] - prefix[i])

Yes, that's what I have.

In the sample input:

dp[4] = 9 + 20 - 15 = 14

dp[3] = 6 + 20 - 7 = 19

But dp[4] + prefix[3] = 14 + 15 = 29, which is greater than 19, so min_val remains 19

dp[2] = 3 + 19 - 4 = 25 -4=21

dp[3] + prefix[2] = 19 + 15 = 34, which is greater than 21, so min_val remains 21

dp[1] = 7 + 21 - 0 = 28

dp[2] + prefix[1] = 21 + 7 = 28, which is equal, so min_val remains 21

Then, min(dp[1], dp[2]) = min(28,21)=21

But the sample output is 14.

Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the dp formula.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider that Kirill can perform multiple swaps.

In the dp approach, dp[i] represents the minimal cost to reach position i from position n+1.

To compute dp[i], I need to consider all possible j > i and take the minimal dp[j] + cost to swap from j to i.

The cost to swap from j to i is a_i + sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k

Wait, why a_i? In the problem statement, it says paying a_j and sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

Wait, perhaps I confused the indices.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"he can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j. In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k."

So, swapping from i to j (j < i):

- Pay a_j

- Pay b_k for each k where j < k < i

So, the total cost is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k

In terms of prefix sums, sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k = prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

Therefore, cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

Wait, but in the dp formula, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + cost from j to i)

Wait, I think I messed up the indices.

Let me redefine dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from position n+1.

To reach position i, Kirill can come from any position j > i by swapping with j, which costs a_j + sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k

Wait, no, swapping from j to i means Kirill moves from j to i, paying a_j and sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k

So, cost to move from j to i is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k

In terms of prefix sums, sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k = prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

Therefore, cost to move from j to i is a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]

So, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j])

I can rearrange this as:

dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j + prefix[i-1])

Which is:

dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) + prefix[i-1]

So, dp[i] = min_term + prefix[i-1], where min_term is the minimum of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) for j > i

If I can maintain min_term as I process i from n down to 1, I can compute dp[i] efficiently.

I need to maintain the minimum of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) for j > i.

So, I can keep track of the minimum value as I iterate i from n+1 down to 1.

Initialize min_term = dp[n+1] - prefix[n+1] + a[n+1], but dp[n+1]=0, and prefix[n+1] is undefined.

Wait, positions are from 1 to n+1, and prefix is defined from 1 to n.

I need to be careful with indices.

Let me define prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = b[1]

prefix[2] = b[1] + b[2]

...

prefix[n] = b[1] + ... + b[n]

Then, for i from n down to 1:

Find min over j > i of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) and then dp[i] = min_term + prefix[i-1]

Initialize min_term = dp[n+1] - prefix[n] + a[n], but dp[n+1]=0, a[n]=a_n, prefix[n]=sum_{k=1}^n b_k

Wait, in the sample input, n=4, a[4]=9, prefix[4]=20

So, min_term = 0 - 20 + 9 = -11

Then, for i=4:

dp[4] = min_term + prefix[3] = -11 + 15 = 4

Wait, but in the sample, it should be 14.

Hmm, not matching.

Maybe I have a mistake in the formula.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph and use Dijkstra's algorithm, but with n up to 200,000 and t up to 10,000, it's too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can move from position i to position j (j < i) by paying a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k

I need to find the minimal cost to go from n+1 to any position <= m.

Maybe I can consider that the optimal path is to jump directly to some position j, then from j to some position k, and so on, until reaching a position <= m.

But I need a smarter way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the minimal cost to reach position i is the minimum between:

- The cost to reach position i directly from n+1

- The cost to reach position i by going through some position j > i

But I still need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position p, where 1 <= p <= m.

He can do this by swapping with someone at position j > p, then swapping with someone at position k > j, and so on, until he reaches position n+1.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as Kirill moving left in the queue by swapping with people ahead of him.

Each swap has a cost associated with it.

I need to find the sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

This seems similar to finding the shortest path in a graph where edges have costs.

But building such a graph is not feasible due to time constraints.

I need a mathematical way to compute the minimal cost.

Let me consider that Kirill can move from position i to position j (j < i) by paying a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k

I need to find the minimal cost to go from n+1 to some position <= m.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Kirill can move directly from n+1 to any position j <= m by a series of swaps, and I need to compute the minimal cost for that.

But I still need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform swaps in such a way that he moves left in the queue, and I need to find the optimal sequence of swaps.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to pay a_j to jump to position j, and then pay b_k for all positions between j and i.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a series of jumps, where each jump has a cost.

But I need to find a way to compute the minimal cost efficiently.

Let me consider that for each position i, the minimal cost to reach i is the minimum cost among all possible previous positions j > i.

But again, this seems too slow for large n.

I need a way to compute this in linear time.

Let me consider processing positions from n down to 1, keeping track of the minimal cost to reach positions j > i.

So, for position i, dp[i] = a_i + min_{j=i+1}^{n+1} (dp[j] + sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k)

But sum_{k=i+1}^{j-1} b_k = prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]

So, dp[i] = a_i + min_{j=i+1}^{n+1} (dp[j] + prefix[j-1] - prefix[i])

Which is dp[i] = a_i - prefix[i] + min_{j=i+1}^{n+1} (dp[j] + prefix[j-1])

So, dp[i] = a_i - prefix[i] + min_term

Where min_term = min_{j=i+1}^{n+1} (dp[j] + prefix[j-1])

I can compute min_term as I process i from n down to 1.

Initialize min_term for i=n+1:

dp[n+1] = 0

prefix[n] = sum_{k=1}^n b_k

So, min_term = dp[n+1] + prefix[n] = 0 + prefix[n]

Then, for i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i - prefix[i] + min_term

Then, min_term = min(min_term, dp[i] + prefix[i-1])

Wait, let's verify this with the sample input.

Sample input:

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=4

prefix[2]=4+3=7

prefix[3]=7+8=15

prefix[4]=15+5=20

Initialize dp[5]=0

min_term = dp[5] + prefix[4] = 0 + 20 = 20

For i=4:

dp[4] = a[4] - prefix[4] + min_term = 9 - 20 + 20 = 9

Then, min_term = min(20, dp[4] + prefix[3]) = min(20, 9 + 15)=min(20,24)=20

For i=3:

dp[3] = a[3] - prefix[3] + min_term = 6 - 15 + 20 = 21

Then, min_term = min(20, 21 + prefix[2]) = min(20, 21 + 7)=min(20,28)=20

For i=2:

dp[2] = a[2] - prefix[2] + min_term = 3 - 7 + 20 = 16

Then, min_term = min(20, 16 + prefix[1]) = min(20, 16 + 4)=min(20,20)=20

For i=1:

dp[1] = a[1] - prefix[0] + min_term = 7 - 0 + 20 = 27

Then, min_term = min(20, 27 + prefix[0]) = min(20,27)=20

Then, the minimal dp[i] for i=1 to 2 is min(dp[1], dp[2})=min(27,16)=16

But the sample output is 14.

Hmm, still not matching.

Wait, maybe I have a mistake in the formula.

Let me check the dp formula again.

dp[i] = a_i - prefix[i] + min_{j=i+1}^{n+1} (dp[j] + prefix[j-1])

Then, min_term = min(min_term, dp[i] + prefix[i-1])

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me try redefining min_term.

Initialize min_term = dp[n+1] + prefix[n]

For i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i - prefix[i] + min_term

Then, min_term = min(min_term, dp[i] + prefix[i-1])

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the initial min_term.

Wait, dp[n+1] = 0

prefix[n] = sum_{k=1}^n b_k

So, min_term = 0 + prefix[n]

Then, for i=4:

dp[4] = 9 - prefix[4] + min_term = 9 - 20 + 20 = 9

Then, min_term = min(20, 9 + prefix[3]) = min(20, 9 + 15)=min(20,24)=20

For i=3:

dp[3] = 6 - 15 + 20 = 11

min_term = min(20, 11 + 15)=min(20,26)=20

For i=2:

dp[2] = 3 - 7 + 20 = 16

min_term = min(20, 16 + 7)=min(20,23)=20

For i=1:

dp[1] = 7 - 0 + 20 = 27

min_term = min(20, 27 + 0)=min(20,27)=20

Then, min(dp[1], dp[2})=min(27,16)=16

Still not matching the sample output of 14.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be dp[i] = a_i + min_{j=i+1}^{n+1} (dp[j] + prefix[j-1] - prefix[i])

Which is dp[i] = a_i + min_{j=i+1}^{n+1} (dp[j] + prefix[j-1]) - prefix[i]

So, dp[i] = a_i - prefix[i] + min_{j=i+1}^{n+1} (dp[j] + prefix[j-1])

Then, min_term = min_{j=i+1}^{n+1} (dp[j] + prefix[j-1])

So, for i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i - prefix[i] + min_term

Then, min_term = min(min_term, dp[i] + prefix[i-1])

Wait, in the sample input:

Initialize min_term = dp[5] + prefix[4] = 0 + 20 = 20

i=4:

dp[4] = 9 - 20 + 20 = 9

min_term = min(20, 9 + 15)=min(20,24)=20

i=3:

dp[3] = 6 - 15 + 20 = 11

min_term = min(20,11 + 7)=min(20,18)=18

i=2:

dp[2] = 3 - 7 + 18 = 14

min_term = min(18,14 + 4)=min(18,18)=18

i=1:

dp[1] =7 -0 +18=25

min_term = min(18,25 +0)=18

Then, min(dp[1], dp[2})=min(25,14)=14

Which matches the sample output.

Ah, so in my earlier calculation, I had min_term updating to 18 at i=3, but in my previous step, I had min_term remaining 20.

That must be the mistake.

So, yes, the correct approach is:

Initialize min_term = dp[n+1] + prefix[n] = 0 + prefix[n]

For i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = a_i - prefix[i] + min_term

Then, min_term = min(min_term, dp[i] + prefix[i-1])

Then, the answer is the minimum dp[i] for i from 1 to m.

In the sample input, dp[1]=25, dp[2]=14, so the minimal is 14.

Okay, that seems correct now.

So, in code, I need to:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read a list of n integers a_1 to a_n.

- Read b list of n integers b_1 to b_n.

- Compute prefix sums for b: prefix[0]=0, prefix[1]=b[1], prefix[2]=b[1]+b[2], ..., prefix[n]=sum_{k=1}^n b_k

- Initialize dp = [0] * (n+2)

- Initialize min_term = dp[n+1] + prefix[n] = 0 + prefix[n]

- For i from n down to 1:

- dp[i] = a[i-1] - prefix[i] + min_term

- min_term = min(min_term, dp[i] + prefix[i-1])

- Then, the answer is the minimum dp[i] for i from 1 to m.

- Print this minimum.

I need to implement this efficiently, considering that n can be up to 200,000 and t up to 10,000.

So, I need to make sure that the implementation is optimized.

In Python, reading input efficiently is important for large inputs.

I can read all input at once and process it accordingly.

Also, using sys.stdin.readline for faster input.

But since t can be up to 10,000 and n up to 200,000, I need to make sure that the code runs efficiently.

Now, looking at the provided code:

def func():

x = int(input())

custos = []

for i in range(x):

custo = 0

num_fila = 0

max_p = 0

a_values = []

b_values = []

nf = input().split()

num_fila = int(nf[0])

max_p = int(nf[1])

a = input().split()

b = input().split()

for y in a:

a_values.append(int(y))

for y in b:

b_values.append(int(y))

for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):

if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:

custo += a_values[y]

else:

custo += b_values[y]

for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):

if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:

custo += b_values[y]

if y == 1:

custo += a_values[0]

break

else:

custo += a_values[y]

break

custos.append(custo)

for c in custos:

print(c)

This code seems to be attempting to compute the minimal cost as described, but it's not clear if it's following the correct algorithm.

In particular, the logic inside the loops doesn't match the dp approach I derived.

In the first loop, it iterates from num_fila -1 down to max_p -1, and chooses to add either a_values[y] or b_values[y] based on which is smaller.

Then, in the second loop, it iterates from max_p -1 down to 0, and adds b_values[y] if a_values[y-1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y], otherwise adds a_values[y].

This seems different from the dp approach.

I suspect this code is incorrect because it doesn't account for the cumulative sums and the minimal costs properly.

In the dp approach, we need to consider the prefix sums and maintain a minimum over a suffix.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

So, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill must spend to reach a position among the first m people in a queue of n people. Kirill can bribe people ahead of him to swap positions, incurring specific costs based on the positions involved.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Kirill starts at position n+1 and wants to be among the first m positions.
   - He can swap with anyone ahead of him (position j < i), paying a_j to the person at position j and b_k to everyone between j and i.

2. **Insight**:
   - This can be modeled as a graph where positions are nodes, and swaps are edges with associated costs.
   - We need the minimal cost to reach any position from 1 to m starting from position n+1.

3. **Optimal Solution**:
   - Use dynamic programming to calculate the minimal cost to reach each position.
   - Maintain a running minimum to optimize the calculation.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Compute prefix sums of b_k for efficient calculation of ranges.
   - Use a dp array where dp[i] represents the minimal cost to reach position i.
   - Iterate from position n down to 1, calculating dp[i] using the formula:
     \\[ \text{dp}[i] = a_i - \text{prefix}[i] + \text{min\_term} \\]
     where min_term is the minimum of (dp[j] + prefix[j-1]) for j > i.
   - Keep track of the minimum dp[i] for i from 1 to m.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        m = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        b = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + b[i - 1]
        dp = [0] * (n + 2)
        min_term = dp[n + 1] + prefix[n]
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            dp[i] = a[i - 1] - prefix[i] + min_term
            if i == 1:
                min_term = min(min_term, dp[i] + prefix[0])
            else:
                min_term = min(min_term, dp[i] + prefix[i - 1])
        results.append(str(min(dp[1:m + 1])))
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
  - Parse the number of test cases and iterate through each test case.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
  - Compute prefix sums of the b array to quickly calculate the sum of b_k for any range.

- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - Initialize dp array with zeros.
  - Use a min_term variable to keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] + prefix[j-1]) for j > i.
  - Iterate from position n down to 1, calculating dp[i] using the formula:
    \\[ \text{dp}[i] = a_i - \text{prefix}[i] + \text{min\_term} \\]
  - Update min_term for the next iteration.

- **Result Collection**:
  - For each test case, collect the minimum dp[i] for i from 1 to m.
  - Print the results for all test cases.

This approach ensures efficient computation within the constraints, providing the correct minimal cost for each test case.
