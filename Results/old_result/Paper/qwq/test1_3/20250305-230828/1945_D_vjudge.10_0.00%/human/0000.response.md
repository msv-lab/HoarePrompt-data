Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n+1. He doesn't like waiting, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue after some series of swaps. Each swap has a cost associated with it, and I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to achieve his goal.

First, I need to understand the rules of swapping. If Kirill is at position i, he can choose any position j that is before him (j < i) and swap places with that person. When he does this, he has to pay a_j coins to the person at position j. Additionally, for everyone between j and i (excluding j and i), he has to pay b_k coins to each of them.

My task is to find the minimum total cost for Kirill to move from position n+1 down to some position between 1 and m inclusive.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to model the queue. The queue has positions from 1 to n, and Kirill is at position n+1. He wants to move to a position between 1 and m.

I need to consider the costs involved in moving from position n+1 to position i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m.

But since he can perform multiple swaps, I need to find the sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

This sounds like a problem that can be modeled using dynamic programming or some greedy approach, but I need to think carefully about how the costs accumulate.

Let me consider the queue positions from left to right, with position 1 being the front of the queue.

Kirill starts at position n+1 and wants to reach a position between 1 and m.

He can swap with anyone before him, but each swap has a cost.

Moreover, when he swaps with someone, he has to pay not only to that person but also to everyone between them.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can think of it in terms of moving Kirill forward in the queue, one step at a time, choosing the best way to move forward.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the positions in reverse order, starting from position n+1 and moving towards position 1.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to formalize the problem.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimum cost for Kirill to reach position i from position n+1.

He wants dp[i] for i from 1 to m, and then we'll take the minimum among those dp[i].

But I need to define how to compute dp[i].

To reach position i, he can come from any position j where i < j ≤ n+1, by swapping with the person at position j.

Wait, no. In the problem, he can choose any position j < i and swap with that person.

Wait, I need to be careful here.

In the problem statement, it says: "he can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j."

So, to move to a position j, which is before his current position i, he has to pay a_j coins to the person at position j, and for each k such that j < k < i, he has to pay b_k coins to the person at position k.

So, the cost to swap from position i to position j is a_j plus the sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

This seems like a complex operation, especially since he can do this multiple times.

I need to find an efficient way to compute the minimum cost to move from position n+1 to some position between 1 and m.

Let me consider the queue as an array, with positions from 1 to n.

Kirill is at position n+1, which is after the last person.

He wants to move to a position between 1 and m.

He can perform swaps with anyone before him, paying a_j to the person at position j, and paying b_k to everyone between j and i.

I need to model this in a way that allows me to compute the minimum cost.

Perhaps I can think of this as a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges from position i to position j (j < i) with cost a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from position n+1 to any position between 1 and m.

But with n up to 200,000, building a graph with such edges is not feasible due to time and space constraints.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider the process step by step.

Suppose Kirill is at position i.

He can choose to swap with anyone before him, say position j, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

After swapping, he moves to position j.

He can repeat this process until he reaches a position ≤ m.

I need to find the sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

This seems like a shortest path problem, but I need a better way to model it.

Let me consider the positions in reverse order, from n+1 down to 1.

I'll try to compute the minimum cost to reach position i.

Let me define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n+1.

I need to compute dp[i] for i from 1 to m and then take the minimum among them.

Now, how to compute dp[i]?

To reach position i, Kirill can come from any position j where i < j ≤ n+1, by swapping to position i.

Wait, no. In the problem, he can swap with anyone before him, so j < i.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me read the problem again.

"he can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j. In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k."

So, to swap from position i to position j (j < i), the cost is a_j plus sum of b_k for j < k < i.

Wait, but in the problem, it's stated that he is at position i and swaps with position j < i, paying a_j and for each k between j and i, paying b_k.

Wait, more precisely, for each k such that j < k < i, he pays b_k to the person at position k.

So, the total cost to swap from i to j is a_j plus sum of b_k from k = j+1 to i-1.

After the swap, he is now at position j.

He can repeat this process until he reaches a position ≤ m.

I need to find the sequence of such swaps that minimizes the total cost.

This seems like a directed graph where each node is a position, and there is an edge from i to j (for j < i) with cost a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But again, with n up to 200,000, building such a graph is not practical.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the positions from 1 to n+1, where positions 1 to n are the queue, and position n+1 is where Kirill starts.

He wants to reach any position from 1 to m.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach any position ≤ m starting from position n+1.

Given the constraints, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

Let me think about prefix sums.

If I precompute the prefix sums of b_k, I can compute the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 in O(1) time.

Let me denote prefix[j] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=j.

Then, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix[i-1] - prefix[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]).

Wait, but I need to be careful with the indices.

Let me make sure about the prefix sums.

Define prefix[k] = sum of b_1 to b_k.

Then, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix[i-1] - prefix[j].

Yes, that's correct.

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]).

Now, I need to find a way to compute dp[j] for j from 1 to m.

Let me try to write the recurrence.

Define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from position n+1.

Then, dp[i] = min over all j where i < j ≤ n+1 of (dp[j] + a_i + (prefix[i-1] - prefix[j])).

Wait, no.

Wait, if he is at position j and swaps with position i, then the cost is a_i plus sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the final position p where 1 ≤ p ≤ m.

Then, I need to find a sequence of swaps that moves Kirill from n+1 down to p, with minimal total cost.

I need to find, for each p from 1 to m, the minimal cost to reach p, and then take the minimum over those.

But computing this directly seems too slow.

Maybe I can find a way to compute the minimal cost to reach each position, iteratively from n+1 down to 1.

Wait, perhaps I can consider positions in decreasing order, from n+1 to 1, and compute dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i.

Then, dp[n+1] = 0, since he starts there.

Then, for each i from n down to 1, dp[i] = min over j where i < j ≤ n+1 of (dp[j] + a_i + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[i])).

Wait, I'm getting tangled up in the indices.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Suppose I fix the final position p.

Then, to reach p, Kirill needs to perform a series of swaps to move from n+1 to p.

Each swap from i to j costs a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

This seems like a shortest path problem, but with a large number of possible swaps, it's not practical to model it as a graph.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can swap directly from n+1 to any position j < n+1, and from there to any position k < j, and so on, until he reaches a position ≤ m.

I need to find the minimal cost path in this swapping graph.

But again, with n up to 200,000, I need something more efficient.

Perhaps I can use dynamic programming with some clever way to compute the minimum over a range.

Let me consider defining dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i.

I need to compute dp[i] for i from 1 to m.

To compute dp[i], I need to consider all possible positions j where j > i, and take the minimum of dp[j] plus the cost to swap from j to i.

The cost to swap from j to i is a_i + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the problem, when Kirill is at position i and swaps with position j < i, he pays a_j + sum of b_k for j < k < i.

So, in this case, swapping from i to j costs a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, but in terms of dp, if I have dp[i] = cost to reach i, then dp[j] is the cost to reach j.

To go from j to i, I pay a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to redefine dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from position n+1.

Then, dp[n+1] = 0.

For dp[i], I can take the minimum over all j where i < j ≤ n+1 of dp[j] + a_i + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1.

Wait, no.

Wait, when swapping from j to i, paying a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

But in terms of dp, dp[j] is the cost to reach j, and then from j to i, paying a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of it differently.

Let me consider that Kirill starts at n+1 and can swap with anyone before him, i.e., anyone at position j < n+1.

After swapping with j, he is now at position j, and the person at j moves to position n+1.

Then, he can again swap with anyone before him, i.e., before j.

He can repeat this until he reaches a position ≤ m.

I need to find the sequence of such swaps that minimizes the total cost.

This seems like a path in a graph where nodes are positions, and edges are possible swaps with their associated costs.

But again, with n up to 200,000, building such a graph is impractical.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the total cost to move Kirill from n+1 to p (where p ≤ m) is equivalent to the cost to "bypass" all positions from p+1 to n+1.

In other words, to move Kirill to position p, I need to make sure that he swaps past everyone from p+1 to n+1.

Maybe I can think in terms of cumulative costs.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each position p from 1 to m, the minimal cost to move Kirill to p by considering the costs to swap past each person from p+1 to n+1.

But I need to be careful about the dependencies between these swaps.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose I fix the final position p.

Then, to reach p, Kirill needs to have swapped past everyone from p+1 to n+1.

Each of these swaps has a cost.

I need to find the minimal total cost for these swaps.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that to reach position p, Kirill needs to have paid for all positions from p+1 to n+1, either by paying a_j to swap directly with j or by paying b_k to pass through k.

This is still confusing.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i.

Then, dp[i] = min over j where i < j ≤ n+1 of dp[j] + cost to swap from j to i.

The cost to swap from j to i is a_i + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1.

Wait, no.

In the problem, when swapping from i to j (j < i), the cost is a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, I need to be careful with the directions.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have Kirill at position i, and I want to swap him to position j, where j < i.

After the swap, Kirill is at position j, and the person who was at j moves to position i.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the final position p, and consider the sequence of swaps that move Kirill from n+1 to p.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that each person Kirill passes has to be paid either a_j or the sum of b_k for the positions between.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing for each position whether to pay a_j to swap directly with j or to pay b_k to pass through k.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that for each position from p+1 to n+1, Kirill has to decide how to handle it: either swap directly with it (pay a_j) or bypass it by paying the b_k of someone in between.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose Kirill moves from position n+1 to position p via a series of swaps.

Each swap involves moving from i to j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach p.

This seems like a shortest path problem, but with a specific structure.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where positions are nodes, and there are edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But again, with n up to 200,000, this is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider prefix sums for b_k.

Let me define prefix[i] = sum of b_1 to b_i.

Then, sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1 is prefix[i-1] - prefix[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]).

Now, perhaps I can find a way to compute dp[i] using this.

Define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i.

Initialize dp[n+1] = 0.

Then, for each i from n down to 1, dp[i] = min over j where i < j ≤ n+1 of (dp[j] + a_i + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[i])).

Wait, no.

Wait, when swapping from j to i, the cost is a_i + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]).

Wait, I'm getting tangled up in the indices.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the final position p.

Then, to reach p, Kirill needs to perform a series of swaps to move from n+1 to p.

Each swap from j to i (i < j) costs a_i + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]).

I need to find the minimal total cost for such a sequence.

This seems too complex.

Maybe I need to consider that the minimal cost to reach p is the minimal cost to "bypass" everyone from p+1 to n+1.

For each person from p+1 to n+1, Kirill has to either pay a_j to swap directly with them or pay b_k to pass through them.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of inclusion-minimal sets of people to swap with.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for each position from p+1 to n+1, Kirill has to pay either a_j or the sum of b_k for the people between j and p.

But this is still not clear.

Maybe I need to consider that for each position from p+1 to n+1, Kirill has to pay a_j, and for the positions between p and j, he has to pay b_k.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing a subset of people to swap with, and paying their a_j, plus paying b_k for the people not swapped with in between.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that Kirill can choose a set of people to swap with, and for each person not swapped with, he has to pay b_k.

But I need to think more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each position from p+1 to n+1, Kirill has to pay either a_j or the sum of b_k from j to p.

Wait, no.

Let me consider that to move past a person at position j, Kirill can either:

1. Swap directly with them, paying a_j, or

2. Pay b_k to pass through them without swapping.

But in the problem, the swapping operation allows him to move to position j by paying a_j and paying b_k for everyone between j and i.

It's not about passing through individuals one by one.

I need to find a way to model the entire path of swaps in a more efficient manner.

Maybe I can consider that the total cost to move from n+1 to p is the sum of a_j for each swap, plus the sum of b_k for each position k that is bypassed.

But I need to formalize this.

This is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps I need to look for a different strategy altogether.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to reach position p is the minimal cost to perform a series of swaps that move Kirill from n+1 to p.

Each swap from i to j (j < i) costs a_j plus the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimal total cost for such a series of swaps.

This seems like a shortest path problem, but with a specific structure that I need to exploit.

Maybe I can consider that the minimal cost to reach p is the minimal cost among all possible sequences of swaps that get Kirill from n+1 to p.

But with n up to 200,000, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that for each position p, the minimal cost to reach p is the minimal cost to reach some position j > p and then swap from j to p.

So, dp[p] = min over j where p < j ≤ n+1 of (dp[j] + a_p + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[p])).

Wait, no.

Wait, when swapping from j to p, the cost is a_p + sum of b_k from p+1 to j-1.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me try to define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i.

Then, dp[i] = min over j where i < j ≤ n+1 of (dp[j] + a_i + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[i])).

Yes, that makes sense.

Because to reach i, you come from j > i, swap from j to i, paying a_i and sum of b_k from i+1 to j-1.

So, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_i + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[i])).

Now, with this recurrence, I can try to compute dp[i] for i from n down to 1.

I need to compute dp[i] for each i from n down to 1.

But with n up to 200,000, I need an efficient way to compute this.

The issue is that for each i, I need to find the minimal dp[j] + a_i + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]) over j > i.

This seems like for each i, I need to find the minimal dp[j] + prefix[j-1] over j > i, and then subtract prefix[i].

So, dp[i] = (min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix[j-1])) - prefix[i] + a_i.

Now, if I can compute the min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix[j-1]), then I can compute dp[i] efficiently.

To do this, I can maintain a variable that keeps track of the minimal dp[j] + prefix[j-1] for j from i+1 to n+1.

I can iterate from i = n down to 1, keeping track of this minimum.

So, here's how I can implement it:

- Initialize dp as an array of size n+2, with dp[n+1] = 0.

- Compute prefix sums for b_k.

- Initialize a variable, say, min_val, to keep track of the minimal dp[j] + prefix[j-1] for j from i+1 to n+1.

- Iterate i from n down to 1:

- If i+1 <= n+1, update min_val = min(min_val, dp[i+1] + prefix[i])

- dp[i] = min_val - prefix[i] + a_i

- Finally, find the minimal dp[i] for i from 1 to m.

This seems correct.

Let me verify with the first example.

Example 1:

Input:

4

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, t=4 test cases, but seems like only one test case is shown here.

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Compute prefix sums:

prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = 4

prefix[2] = 4+3=7

prefix[3] = 7+8=15

prefix[4] = 15+5=20

Initialize dp[5] = 0

Compute dp[4]:

min_val = dp[5] + prefix[4] = 0 + 20 = 20

dp[4] = 20 - prefix[4] + a[4] = 0 - 20 + 9 = -11

Wait, that doesn't make sense, because costs are positive.

I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me consider that positions are from 1 to n, and n+1 is the initial position.

So, for n=4, positions are 1,2,3,4, and n+1=5.

Initialize dp[5] = 0

Compute dp[4]:

min_val = dp[5] + prefix[4] = 0 + 20 = 20

dp[4] = 20 - prefix[3] + a[4] = 20 - 15 + 9 = 14

Wait, but prefix[3] is the sum from b_1 to b_3, which is 4+3+8=15

a[4]=9

So, dp[4] = 20 - 15 + 9 = 14

Okay, that matches the first output example, which is 14.

Wait, but in the problem, the output is 14 for the first test case.

So, perhaps my approach is correct.

Let me check the second test case.

Second test case:

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=5

prefix[2]=5+8=13

prefix[3]=13+8=21

prefix[4]=21+1=22

prefix[5]=22+4=26

prefix[6]=26+1=27

Initialize dp[7]=0

Compute dp[6]:

min_val = dp[7] + prefix[6] = 0 + 27 = 27

dp[6] = 27 - prefix[5] + a[6] = 27 - 26 + 3 = 4

Compute dp[5]:

min_val = min(min_val, dp[6] + prefix[5]) = min(27, 4 + 26) = min(27,30)=27

dp[5] = 27 - prefix[4] + a[5] = 27 - 22 + 8 = 13

Compute dp[4]:

min_val = min(min_val, dp[5] + prefix[4]) = min(27,13+22)=min(27,35)=27

dp[4] = 27 - prefix[3] + a[4] = 27 -21 +1=7

Compute dp[3]:

min_val = min(min_val, dp[4] + prefix[3]) = min(27,7+21)=min(27,28)=27

dp[3] = 27 - prefix[2] + a[3] = 27 -13 +7=21

Compute dp[2]:

min_val = min(min_val, dp[3] + prefix[2]) = min(27,21+13)=min(27,34)=27

dp[2] = 27 - prefix[1] + a[2] =27 -5 +9=31

Compute dp[1]:

min_val = min(min_val, dp[2] + prefix[1]) = min(27,31+5)=min(27,36)=27

dp[1] =27 - prefix[0] + a[1]=27 -0 +6=33

Now, m=2, so minimal dp[1] and dp[2], which are 33 and 31, so 31.

But in the sample output, it's 22, not 31.

So, my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Let me check again.

I have dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_i + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]))

Wait, perhaps I should have dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]))

Wait, in the problem, when swapping from i to j, paying a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, but in my earlier notation, I might have misassigned a_i and a_j.

Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the cost.

When Kirill is at position i and swaps with position j < i, he pays a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

In terms of dp, dp[i] should be the minimal cost to reach position i.

Then, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + (prefix[j-1] - prefix[i]))

Because when swapping from j to i, the cost is a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1, which is prefix[i-1] - prefix[j].

Wait, no.

Sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix[i-1] - prefix[j].

Yes.

So, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + (prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]))

Wait, I think I had a mistake in the previous steps.

So, correcting this:

dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + (prefix[i-1] - prefix[j]))

Then, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j + prefix[i-1])

So, dp[i] = (min over j > i of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j)) + prefix[i-1]

Now, I can maintain a variable that keeps track of the minimum value of (dp[j] - prefix[j] + a_j) for j from i+1 to n+1.

Then, dp[i] = min_val + prefix[i-1]

And after computing dp[i], I can update min_val with dp[i] - prefix[i] + a_i.

Wait, let's see.

Initialize min_val for i from n down to 1.

At each step:

- dp[i] = min_val + prefix[i-1]

- min_val = min(min_val, dp[i] - prefix[i] + a_i)

Wait, let's verify this with the first test case.

First test case:

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=4

prefix[2]=4+3=7

prefix[3]=7+8=15

prefix[4]=15+5=20

Initialize dp[5]=0

Initialize min_val = dp[5] - prefix[4] + a[4] = 0 -20 +9 = -11

Wait, but dp[5]=0, and position 5 is n+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to initialize min_val for j from n down to 1.

Let me try:

Start with i=4:

- min_val = dp[5] - prefix[4] + a[4] = 0 -20 +9 = -11

- dp[4] = min_val + prefix[3] = -11 +15=4

- Then, update min_val = min(min_val, dp[4] - prefix[3] + a[4}) = min(-11, 4-15+9)=min(-11,-2)=-11

Now, i=3:

- min_val=-11

- dp[3]=min_val + prefix[2]= -11 +7=-4

- update min_val = min(-11, -4 -7 +6)=min(-11,-5)=-11

i=2:

- dp[2]=-11 +4=-7

- min_val = min(-11, -7 -4 +3)=min(-11,-8)=-11

i=1:

- dp[1]=-11 +0=-11

- min_val = min(-11, -11 -0 +7)=min(-11,-4)=-11

But the minimal dp[i] for i=1 to m=2 is min(dp[1], dp[2})=min(-11,-7)=-11

But according to the sample input, it should be 14.

So, clearly, my approach is wrong.

I must have misformulated the dp.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider that Kirill can perform multiple swaps, and I need to find the sequence that minimizes the total cost.

Maybe I should consider that Kirill can choose to pay a_j to swap with j, and then continue from j.

Alternatively, he can choose to pay b_k to pass through k without swapping.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing a subset of people to swap with, and for the remaining people, paying b_k.

But I need to ensure that the swaps are compatible in terms of positions.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that for each position p from 1 to m, the minimal cost to reach p is the minimal cost to swap past everyone from p+1 to n+1.

For each person from p+1 to n+1, Kirill has to pay either a_j to swap with j or b_k for each k between p and j.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each person from p+1 to n+1, Kirill has to pay a_j or the sum of b_k from j to p.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that Kirill can choose a set of people to swap with, and for each swap, he pays a_j, and for the people he doesn't swap with, he pays b_k.

So, the total cost would be the sum of a_j for the people he swaps with, plus the sum of b_k for the people he doesn't swap with.

But I need to make sure that by swapping with certain people, he can reach position p.

This seems related to choosing a subset of people to swap with such that the remaining people are bypassed by paying b_k.

But I need to find the minimal cost for such a subset that allows Kirill to reach position p.

This sounds like a minimal cost to cover all positions from p+1 to n+1.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to a covering problem.

But I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each position from p+1 to n+1, Kirill has to pay either a_j to swap with j or b_j to pass through j.

Wait, but passing through j involves paying b_k for the people between.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me consider that for each position j from p+1 to n+1, Kirill has to pay either a_j to swap with j or the sum of b_k from j to p to pass through.

But calculating this sum is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to reach p is the minimal cost to perform a series of swaps that effectively move Kirill from n+1 to p, paying the corresponding costs.

I need to find an efficient way to compute this minimal cost.

Perhaps I can model this as a DP where dp[i] is the minimal cost to reach position i, and I can compute dp[i] based on dp[j] for j > i.

But I need to find the right recurrence.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal cost to reach position i is the minimal cost to reach some position j > i, plus the cost to swap from j to i.

The cost to swap from j to i is a_i plus the sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1.

Wait, no.

In the problem, swapping from i to j (j < i) costs a_j plus sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, I need to be careful.

If Kirill is at position i and swaps with position j < i, he moves to position j, and the person at j moves to position i.

The cost is a_j plus sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

In terms of DP, dp[i] is the minimal cost to reach position i.

To compute dp[i], I need to consider all possible j > i, and dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1).

Wait, no.

Wait, when swapping from j to i, the cost is a_i + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to j-1.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me try to redefine dp[i] as the minimal cost to move from position i to some position <=m.

Then, dp[i] can be computed as:

- If i <= m, dp[i] = 0 (since he's already within the first m positions)

- Else, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1)

But perhaps it's better to iterate from n down to 1, computing dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach some position <=m from i.

Wait, perhaps defining dp[i] as the minimal cost to move from i to some position <=m.

Then, for i <=m, dp[i]=0.

For i > m, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1)

Then, the answer is dp[n+1].

But n+1 is up to 200,001, which is acceptable.

But I need to compute this efficiently.

Let me see.

I can initialize dp[i] for i from 1 to m as 0.

Then, for i from m+1 to n+1:

dp[i] = min over j from 1 to m of (dp[j] + a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1)

Wait, but this seems too slow for n up to 200,000.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix[i-1] - prefix[j].

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix[i-1] - prefix[j])

This can be rewritten as dp[i] = prefix[i-1] + min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j])

Now, I can compute dp[i] for i from m+1 to n+1, keeping track of the minimal (dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j]) for j from m+1 to i-1.

Wait, but this still seems O(n^2), which is too slow.

Wait, but if I keep track of the minimal (dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j]) for j < i, I can compute dp[i] in O(1) time per i.

Because I can maintain a variable that keeps the minimal (dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j]) for j from m+1 to i-1.

Wait, but dp[j] for j <=m is 0, so dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j] = a_j - prefix[j].

So, for j <=m, dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j] = a_j - prefix[j].

For j > m, dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j].

So, for i from m+1 to n+1:

dp[i] = prefix[i-1] + min( min over j=1 to m of (a_j - prefix[j]), min over j=m+1 to i-1 of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j]) )

Wait, no.

Wait, dp[i] = prefix[i-1] + min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j])

Since for j <=m, dp[j]=0, so dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j] = a_j - prefix[j]

For j >m, dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j]

So, for i from m+1 to n+1:

dp[i] = prefix[i-1] + min( min over j=1 to m of (a_j - prefix[j]), min over j=m+1 to i-1 of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j]) )

Now, I can precompute min over j=1 to m of (a_j - prefix[j])

And for j=m+1 to i-1, I can keep a running minimum of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix[j])

So, here's the plan:

- Compute prefix[i] for i from 0 to n

- Initialize dp[j] for j=1 to m as 0

- Compute min_a_minus_prefix = min of (a[j] - prefix[j]) for j=1 to m

- Initialize min_dp_plus_a_minus_prefix = min_a_minus_prefix

- For i from m+1 to n+1:

- dp[i] = prefix[i-1] + min_dp_plus_a_minus_prefix

- If i > m:

- Update min_dp_plus_a_minus_prefix = min(min_dp_plus_a_minus_prefix, dp[i] + a[i] - prefix[i])

- Finally, the answer is dp[n+1]

Wait, but in the problem, Kirill starts at position n+1 and wants to reach some position <=m.

So, the minimal cost should be dp[n+1]

But in the first test case, dp[5] should be 14, but according to this, dp[5] = prefix[4] + min_a_minus_prefix

prefix[4]=20

min_a_minus_prefix = min(a[1]-prefix[1], a[2]-prefix[2]) = min(7-4,3-7)=min(3,-4)=-4

So, dp[5]=20 + (-4)=16

But according to the sample, it's 14.

So, something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I have misformulated the DP.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider that Kirill can choose to swap with any person before him, and I need to find the minimal cost path from n+1 to some position <=m.

This seems like a graph with n+1 nodes, and edges from i to j for j < i with cost a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But with n up to 200,000, building such a graph is impractical.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the cost to move from
