Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1), which is the top-left cell, and needs to reach cell (2,n), which is the bottom-right cell.

Every second, two things happen:

1. The robot moves left, right, down, or up. It can't move outside the grid or skip the move.

2. Then, it moves along the arrow in its current cell.

I need to determine if the robot can reach (2,n) from (1,1) following these rules.

First, I need to understand the movement mechanics clearly. The robot has a choice of direction in the first move each second, and then it's forced to move according to the arrow in its current cell.

Given that the grid has only two rows, movement up or down would simply switch between row 1 and row 2. Left and right moves change the column position.

I should consider how the robot can navigate through the grid, considering the arrows' directions, to reach the target cell.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

4

>><<

>>><

2

><

><

4

>>><

>><<

6

>><<><

><>>><

Output:

YES

YES

NO

YES

From the first test case:

n=4

Row 1: >><<

Row 2: >>><

One possible path is:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Seems like the robot moved right twice, then down, then right again.

In the second test case:

n=2

Row 1: ><

Row 2: ><

Possible path:

(1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)

Here, it moved down then right.

In the third test case:

n=4

Row 1: >>><

Row 2: >><<

And it's impossible to reach (2,4).

In the fourth test case:

n=6

Row 1: >><<><

Row 2: ><>>><

Possible path:

(1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6)

Quite a longer path, moving back and forth between rows.

From these examples, it seems that the robot can move flexibly between the two rows, but the arrows constrain where it can go next.

I need to find a general way to determine if such a path exists for any given n and arrow configurations.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, since there are only two rows, movement is limited to up and down, which effectively toggles between row 1 and row 2.

Left and right moves change the column position, and then the arrow in the new cell dictates an additional move.

But the arrows only point left or right, so no vertical movement is possible via the arrows.

This means that the only way to switch rows is by choosing to move up or down in the first part of the move.

So, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a cell, and I add edges based on possible moves.

Given that, I can try to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from (1,1) to see if I can reach (2,n).

But considering the constraints on n (up to 2*10^5) and t (up to 10^4), with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to have a function func_1 that takes n, row1, and row2, and returns 'Yes' or 'No'. Another function func_2 reads input and calls func_1 for each test case.

Let me look at func_1:

def func_1(n, row1, row2):

half_n = n // 2

for i in range(half_n - 1):

if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):

return 'No'

if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':

return 'No'

return 'Yes'

This seems to be checking some conditions based on the arrows in row1 and row2 at specific positions and deciding 'Yes' or 'No' based on those conditions.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First, it calculates half_n = n // 2, which makes sense since n is even.

Then, it loops from i = 0 to half_n - 2, and checks if row1 at position 2*i + 1 is '<', and either row2 at 2*i or 2*i + 2 is '<'. If so, returns 'No'.

Finally, it checks if row1 at position n-1 is '<' and row2 at n-2 is '<', returning 'No' if both are '<', else 'Yes'.

I need to understand why these specific conditions determine if the robot can reach (2,n).

Let me try to interpret this.

Given that n is even, perhaps the grid can be divided into pairs of columns, and the program is checking certain configurations within these pairs.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the author has found some invariant or property that, if violated at certain positions, makes it impossible to reach the target.

Alternatively, maybe they're simulating the movement in some way and checking for blocking configurations.

Let me consider the movement rules again.

Each second, the robot:

1. Moves left, right, down, or up (can't go outside the grid).

2. Then moves according to the arrow in the current cell.

Given that arrows only point left or right, the second part of the move is always horizontal.

This means that after choosing a direction in the first part, the robot moves again based on the arrow.

So, effectively, each move consists of two consecutive steps: a chosen direction followed by a mandatory move according to the arrow.

I need to consider all possible combinations of these moves to see if I can reach (2,n) from (1,1).

This seems complex, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Perhaps I can model the movement as a graph where edges represent possible transitions between cells, considering both parts of the move.

Given time constraints, I need an efficient way to determine reachability.

Looking back at func_1, it seems to be checking specific positions in row1 and row2 for '<' arrows.

Specifically, it checks positions in row1 that are odd indices (1-based), and corresponding positions in row2.

Wait, indices in Python are 0-based, so row1[2*i + 1] corresponds to the second cell in each pair of columns.

For example, for n=4:

row1: indices 0,1,2,3

row2: indices 0,1,2,3

func_1 would loop for i from 0 to 1 (since half_n = 2):

Check row1[1] ('<') and row2[0] and row2[2].

If row1[1] is '<' and either row2[0] or row2[2] is '<', return 'No'.

Then, check row1[3] and row2[2].

If both are '<', return 'No'.

Else, return 'Yes'.

In the first test case:

row1: >><< (indices: 0: '>', 1: '<', 2: '>', 3: '<')

row2: >>>< (indices: 0: '>', 1: '>', 2: '>', 3: '<')

Check i=0:

row1[1] == '<', row2[0] == '>', row2[2] == '>', so no 'No'.

Check i=1:

row1[3] == '<', row2[2] == '>', so no 'No'.

So, returns 'Yes'.

In the third test case:

row1: >>>< (indices: 0: '>', 1: '>', 2: '<', 3: '<')

row2: >><< (indices: 0: '>', 1: '<', 2: '<', 3: '<')

Check i=0:

row1[1] == '>', so no 'No'.

Check i=1:

row1[3] == '<', row2[2] == '<', so return 'No'.

Which matches the expected output.

So, the function seems to be correctly identifying blocking configurations.

But I need to understand why these specific configurations block the path.

Let me think about the possible movements.

Suppose the robot is in some cell (r,c). It can choose to move left, right, down, or up.

After choosing the direction, it moves to the new cell and then follows the arrow in that cell.

So, effectively, from (r,c), it can end up in various positions based on its initial choice and the arrow.

Given that, perhaps certain arrow configurations prevent the robot from progressing forward.

Specifically, if in row1 at some column, there's a '<' arrow, and in row2 adjacent columns have '<' arrows, it might create a situation where the robot can't cross from one side to the other.

But I need to think more carefully.

Maybe I should consider the grid as a graph where nodes are cells, and edges represent possible moves.

Given that, I can perform a BFS from (1,1) to see if I can reach (2,n).

However, considering the constraints, BFS per test case would be too slow if implemented naively.

But since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

The provided func_1 seems to be O(n), as it loops through half_n -1, which is O(n/2).

So, it's efficient enough.

But I need to verify if the logic is correct.

Looking back at the function:

def func_1(n, row1, row2):

half_n = n // 2

for i in range(half_n - 1):

if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):

return 'No'

if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':

return 'No'

return 'Yes'

It seems to be checking specific positions in row1 and row2.

I need to see if these checks are sufficient to determine reachability.

Perhaps the author has found that if certain patterns of '<' arrows occur, they block the path in such a way that it's impossible to reach (2,n).

Let me consider the third test case where it returns 'No':

n=4

row1: >>><

row2: >><<

So, row1: indices 0: '>', 1: '>', 2: '<', 3: '<'

row2: indices 0: '>', 1: '<', 2: '<', 3: '<'

In func_1:

half_n = 2

Loop for i=0:

row1[1] == '>', so no 'No'

Loop for i=1:

row1[3] == '<', row2[2] == '<', so return 'No'

Hence, 'No'

Indeed, in this configuration, it might be impossible to cross from column 3 to column 4.

Similarly, in the first test case:

row1: >><<

row2: >>><

func_1:

half_n=2

i=0:

row1[1] == '<', row2[0] == '>', row2[2] == '>', so no 'No'

i=1:

row1[3] == '<', row2[2] == '>', so no 'No'

Hence, 'Yes'

Which matches the expected output.

So, perhaps this logic works, but I need to verify it more thoroughly.

Let me consider another test case where n=2:

row1: ><

row2: ><

func_1:

half_n=1

Loop for i=0 to -1: no loop

Check row1[1] == '<', row2[0] == '<', so return 'No'

But according to the sample input, it should return 'Yes'

Wait, in the sample input, for n=2:

><

><

Output: YES

But according to func_1, it would return 'No' because row1[1] == '<' and row2[0] == '<'

Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, in Python, string indices start at 0.

So, for n=2:

row1: indices 0: '>', 1: '<'

row2: indices 0: '<', 1: '>'

func_1:

half_n = 1

Loop for i in range(0): no iteration

Then, check row1[n-1]==row1[1]=='<', and row2[n-2]==row2[0]=='<', so return 'No'

But according to the sample, it should be 'Yes'

So, there's a discrepancy here.

This suggests that func_1 is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's '><' and '><', and output is 'YES'

But func_1 would return 'No', which contradicts the sample output.

Hence, func_1 is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
