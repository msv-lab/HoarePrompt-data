Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month, and each round needs one problem of each difficulty level: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. He already has a bank of n problems with various difficulties, and I need to figure out how many additional problems he needs to create to have enough for m rounds.

First, I need to understand the requirements. For each round, Vlad needs one problem of each difficulty level. So, for m rounds, he needs m problems of each level. That means, for levels 'A' to 'G', he needs m problems of 'A', m of 'B', and so on up to 'G'.

Given that he already has a bank of n problems, some of which may be of the required levels. So, for each difficulty level, I need to check how many problems he already has and see if it's enough for m rounds. If not, I need to calculate how many more he needs to create for that level.

Then, sum up the deficiencies across all levels to get the total number of problems he needs to create.

Let me try to formalize this.

1. For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', count how many problems are already in the bank.

2. For each level, if the count is less than m, he needs to create m - count additional problems for that level.

3. Sum up all the additional problems needed across all levels.

That seems straightforward.

Let me look at the example provided to verify my understanding.

Example:

Input:

3

10 1 BGECDCBDED

10 2 BGECDCBDED

9 1 BBCDEFFGG

Output:

2

5

1

Let's take the first test case:

n=10, m=1, a='BGECDCBDED'

So, count the occurrences of each difficulty:

A: 0

B: 3

C: 2

D: 3

E: 2

F: 0

G: 1

For m=1, he needs 1 of each level.

So, for A: needed 1, has 0 → need to create 1

F: needed 1, has 0 → need to create 1

Total additional problems needed: 2

Matches the first output.

Second test case:

n=10, m=2, a='BGECDCBDED'

Counts:

A: 0

B: 3

C: 2

D: 3

E: 2

F: 0

G: 1

For m=2, he needs 2 of each level.

So:

A: needed 2, has 0 → create 2

F: needed 2, has 0 → create 2

G: needed 2, has 1 → create 1

Total: 5

Matches the second output.

Third test case:

n=9, m=1, a='BBCDEFFGG'

Counts:

A: 0

B: 2

C: 1

D: 1

E: 1

F: 2

G: 2

For m=1, he needs 1 of each.

So:

A: needed 1, has 0 → create 1

Total: 1

Matches the third output.

Great, my understanding seems correct.

Now, looking at the provided program.

The program is written in Python, and it seems to implement the logic I just described.

Let me walk through the code.

First, there's a function func_1(t, test_cases) where t is the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing n, m, and a string a.

Inside func_1:

- Initialize an empty list results to store the results of each test case.

- Loop t times:

- Unpack n, m, a from the current test case.

- Initialize a frequency list freq of size 7 (for 'A' to 'G') with zeros.

- Iterate through each character in a:

- Convert the character to its corresponding index (0 for 'A', 1 for 'B', etc.) by subtracting ord('A') from its ASCII value.

- Increment the frequency count for that index.

- Calculate the missing problems for each difficulty level:

- For each frequency f in freq, calculate max(0, m - f). This gives the number of additional problems needed for that level.

- Sum up these values to get the total missing problems.

- Append this sum to the results list.

- Finally, return the list of results.

Outside the function:

- There's a test case setup with t=3 and test_cases containing three tuples, each representing a test case.

- Call func_1 with these arguments and store the results in results.

- Print each result in the results list.

Looking at this, it seems correct.

Let me verify with the example provided.

First test case: n=10, m=1, a='BGECDCBDED'

Frequency counts:

B: 3

G: 2

E: 2

C: 2

D: 3

B: 3

D: 3

E: 1

D: 1

B: 1

Wait, wait. Let's count properly.

a = 'BGECDCBDED'

B: times 'B' appears in 'BGECDCBDED'

B appears at positions 1,7,10 → 3 times

G: position 2 → 1

E: positions 4 and 8 → 2

C: positions 5 and 6 → 2

D: positions 3,9,11 → 3

So, counts:

A: 0

B: 3

C: 2

D: 3

E: 2

F: 0

G: 1

For m=1, needed:

A: 1, has 0 → need 1

F: 1, has 0 → need 1

Total missing: 2

Which matches the first output.

Similarly, I can verify the other test cases, but I'll assume they are correct based on the first one.

So, the program seems to correctly implement the required logic.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
