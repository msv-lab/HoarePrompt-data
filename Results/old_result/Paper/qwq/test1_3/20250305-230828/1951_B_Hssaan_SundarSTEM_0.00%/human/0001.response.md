Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

There are n cows with distinct ratings, each in their initial positions from 1 to n. They participate in a coding tournament with n-1 matches. The first match is between cow 1 and cow 2. Subsequently, each match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in position. The cow with the higher rating always wins.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets. I can choose to swap my cow with another cow's position exactly once or choose not to swap at all.

Given multiple test cases, for each case, I need to output the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve with an optimal swap or no swap.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses and how my cow can participate in as many matches as possible, thereby maximizing wins.

Let's consider the initial setup:

- Cows are in positions 1 to n.

- Matches proceed as follows:

  - Match 1: Position 1 vs Position 2.

  - Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs Position 3.

  - ...

  - Match n-1: Winner of Match n-2 vs Position n.

In each match, the cow with the higher rating wins.

My goal is to maximize the number of matches my cow k wins. I can perform at most one swap of my cow with another cow's position.

I need to decide whether to swap my cow to a different position and, if so, with which cow, to maximize the number of wins.

Let me think about how the tournament progresses based on positions.

Let's consider an example to understand better.

Example 1 from the problem:

n = 6, k = 1

ratings = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

Initially, positions:

1: 12, 2:10, 3:14, 4:11, 5:8, 6:3

Matches:

Match 1: 1 vs 2 → 12 vs 10 → 12 wins

Match 2: 12 vs 14 → 12 < 14 → 14 wins

Match 3: 14 vs 11 → 14 > 11 → 14 wins

Match 4: 14 vs 8 → 14 > 8 → 14 wins

Match 5: 14 vs 3 → 14 > 3 → 14 wins

My cow k=1 (position 1) only won once (Match 1).

But in the explanation, it says that by doing nothing, cow k=1 wins once.

Now, in the second test case:

n=6, k=5

ratings=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

Initially:

1:7, 2:2, 3:727, 4:10, 5:12, 6:13

Matches:

Match 1: 7 vs 2 → 7 wins

Match 2: 7 vs 727 → 7 < 727 → 727 wins

Match 3: 727 vs 10 → 727 > 10 → 727 wins

Match 4: 727 vs 12 → 727 > 12 → 727 wins

Match 5: 727 vs 13 → 727 > 13 → 727 wins

My cow k=5 (position 5) with rating 12 didn't win any match.

But in the explanation, it says that by swapping cow k=5 to position 3, it can win twice.

Wait, position 3 has rating 727, which is higher than 12. So, if I swap cow k=5 (12) with position 3 (727), then:

New positions:

1:7, 2:2, 3:12, 4:10, 5:727, 6:13

Matches:

Match 1: 7 vs 2 → 7 wins

Match 2: 7 vs 12 → 7 < 12 → 12 wins

Match 3: 12 vs 10 → 12 > 10 → 12 wins

Match 4: 12 vs 727 → 12 < 727 → 727 wins

Match 5: 727 vs 13 → 727 > 13 → 727 wins

So, cow k=5 (now at position 3) with rating 12 wins two matches.

Hence, swapping can help increase the number of wins.

Another example:

n=2, k=2

ratings=[1000000000, 1]

Initially:

1:1000000000, 2:1

Matches:

Match 1: 1000000000 vs 1 → 1000000000 wins

My cow k=2 (position 2) with rating 1 doesn't win any match.

Is there a swap that can help?

If I swap position 1 and position 2:

New positions:

1:1, 2:1000000000

Matches:

Match 1: 1 vs 1000000000 → 1000000000 wins

Still, my cow k=2 (now at position 1) with rating 1 doesn't win any match.

So, in this case, no swap can help, and the output is 0.

From these examples, I need to find a way to maximize the number of wins for my cow by choosing to swap it to a position that allows it to win more matches.

Let me try to generalize.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses based on positions.

The tournament is essentially a single-elimination tournament where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

The key is that the cow with the higher rating always wins.

My goal is to position my cow such that it wins as many matches as possible before losing to a higher-rated cow.

Since ratings are distinct, there is a unique cow with the highest rating, and so on.

Let me consider that the tournament continues until my cow loses to a higher-rated cow.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings than my cow that are before it in the sequence.

Wait, not exactly.

Because the tournament is sequential, and the winner progresses to the next match.

So, if I place my cow early in the sequence, it might win fewer matches because it could lose early, whereas if I place it later, it might win more matches.

But it's not straightforward.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of my cow, say position p.

Then, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match 1: position 1 vs position 2.

- Match 2: winner of match 1 vs position 3.

- ...

- Match p-1: winner of match p-2 vs position p-1.

At this point, the winner of match p-1 faces my cow in match p.

If my cow has a higher rating than the winner of match p-1, my cow wins and proceeds.

Then, in match p+1, my cow faces position p+1, and so on, until my cow loses.

So, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than my cow, plus one (for the match against the winner of match p-1, if my cow wins that).

But I need to consider that the winner of match p-1 might have a higher rating than my cow, in which case my cow loses immediately.

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to choose position p such that:

- The winner of match p-1 has a lower rating than my cow.

- Then, among the remaining cows after position p, as many as possible have lower ratings than my cow.

Wait, but the winner of match p-1 depends on the previous matches.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that the winner of match p-1 is the maximum of the first p-1 cows.

Because in each match, the higher-rated cow wins and progresses.

So, the winner of match p-1 is the highest-rated cow among the first p-1 cows.

Therefore, for my cow to win match p, its rating must be higher than the highest rating among the first p-1 cows.

If that's the case, my cow wins match p and proceeds to match p+1, and so on, winning matches against all subsequent cows until it encounters a cow with a higher rating.

Therefore, the number of wins for my cow when placed at position p is:

- If p == 1: my cow automatically wins match 1 against position 2.

- Else:

- If my cow's rating > max(ratings of positions 1 to p-1):

- Then, my cow wins match p, and proceeds to win matches against all positions p+1 to q, where q is the smallest index > p such that ratings[q] > my cow's rating.

- The number of wins is q - p.

- Else:

- My cow loses at match p.

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to choose p such that:

- p is as small as possible, but

- The max of positions 1 to p-1 is less than my cow's rating.

Because the smaller p is, the more matches my cow can potentially win.

Wait, but if p is smaller, the max of positions 1 to p-1 is smaller, which might be good, but I need to ensure that my cow's rating is higher than that max.

Alternatively, if I place my cow at position p, and its rating is higher than the max of positions 1 to p-1, then it will win match p, and then win all matches against positions p+1 to the first position q where ratings[q] > my cow's rating.

The number of wins is q - p.

So, to maximize q - p, I need to choose p as small as possible such that my cow's rating > max(positions 1 to p-1), and then q is the smallest index > p where ratings[q] > my cow's rating.

So, the strategy is:

- Find the maximum possible p such that p is the smallest index where my cow can be placed, and its rating is greater than the max of positions 1 to p-1.

- Then, find the smallest q > p where ratings[q] > my cow's rating.

- The number of wins is q - p.

Wait, but I need to maximize q - p.

But to maximize q - p, I need to minimize p and maximize q.

So, I need to choose p as small as possible where my cow's rating > max(positions 1 to p-1), and then choose p such that q is as large as possible.

But q is determined by the first cow after p with rating > my cow's rating.

So, to maximize q - p, I need to choose p such that the first cow after p with rating > my cow's rating is as late as possible.

Wait, this seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix p, the position of my cow.

Then, for my cow to win match p, its rating must be > max(ratings[1 to p-1]).

If this condition is satisfied, then my cow wins match p, and proceeds to win matches against all positions p+1 to q-1, where q is the smallest index > p such that ratings[q] > my cow's rating.

The number of wins is q - p.

So, to maximize q - p, I need to choose p as small as possible where my cow's rating > max(ratings[1 to p-1]), and among those p, choose the one where the first cow after p with rating > my cow's rating is as late as possible.

This seems complicated to compute directly.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that I can swap my cow with any other cow's position, or choose not to swap.

So, I can choose to place my cow at any position, but only by swapping once.

Wait, actually, I can choose to swap my cow with any other cow's position, meaning I can place my cow at any position by swapping with that position.

Because I can choose to swap with any position, including positions before or after my original position.

Wait, but in the problem, k is the index of my cow, and I can choose to swap it with any other position, meaning I can place my cow at any position by swapping it with that position's cow.

Wait, actually, no.

I can choose to swap my cow with another cow's position, meaning I can choose another position p, and swap the cow at position p with my cow at position k.

So, I can choose to place my cow at any position by swapping it with the cow at that position.

Wait, but I can only perform one swap.

Wait, no, I can choose to swap my cow with another cow's position once, meaning I choose one other cow, and swap positions with it.

So, I can choose to swap my cow with any one other cow's position, or choose not to swap.

So, in total, I have n options: keep my cow at position k, or swap it with any one of the other n-1 positions.

So, I need to consider n possibilities: for each possible position p (from 1 to n), where p != k, swap my cow with the cow at position p, and compute the number of wins for my cow, and take the maximum among all these possibilities.

But n can be up to 10^5, and t up to 10^4, so total time complexity must be O(n*t) which is 10^9, which is too slow.

Therefore, I need a smarter approach.

Let me try to find a way to compute the maximum number of wins in O(n) or O(log n) time per test case.

First, let's sort the ratings and keep track of their positions.

Since all ratings are distinct, I can sort them in descending order and see who has the highest ratings.

The cow with the highest rating will win all matches until it faces a cow with a higher rating, but since it has the highest rating, it won't lose until the end.

Wait, but my cow may not have the highest rating.

I need to find the position to place my cow such that it wins as many matches as possible.

Let me consider that if I place my cow at position p, it needs to satisfy that its rating is higher than the winner of match p-1 to win match p.

As discussed earlier, the winner of match p-1 is the highest-rated cow among the first p-1 cows.

So, for my cow to win match p, its rating must be higher than the highest rating among the first p-1 cows.

If this condition is satisfied, then my cow wins match p and proceeds to win matches against all subsequent cows until it encounters a cow with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than my cow, plus one for match p.

Wait, but it's not exactly plus one, because match p is already accounted for if my cow wins it.

Wait, no, the number of wins is the number of matches my cow wins, which includes match p and all subsequent matches against cows with lower ratings.

So, if I place my cow at position p, and its rating > max(ratings[1 to p-1]), then the number of wins is equal to the number of cows from position p to the first position q where ratings[q] > my cow's rating, minus one (since my cow is at position p).

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the sequence of cows my cow beats.

So, if I place my cow at position p, and its rating > max(ratings[1 to p-1]), then it wins match p, and then wins all matches against cows at positions p+1 to the first position q where ratings[q] > my cow's rating.

So, the number of wins is q - p.

I need to maximize q - p over all possible p where p is a valid position to place my cow.

A valid position p is one where my cow's rating > max(ratings[1 to p-1]).

So, to maximize q - p, I need to choose p as small as possible where my cow's rating > max(ratings[1 to p-1]), and q as large as possible, meaning the first position after p where ratings[q] > my cow's rating is as late as possible.

This seems tricky to compute directly for each test case.

Let me think about precomputing some values.

First, I can sort the ratings in descending order and find the order in which cows would win if they were arranged in decreasing order of ratings.

But I need to find the best position to place my cow to maximize the number of wins.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the current position of my cow and see how many wins it gets there, and then see if swapping it with another cow can increase the number of wins.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider two scenarios:

1. Keep my cow at position k.

2. Swap my cow with another position p.

For each scenario, compute the number of wins and choose the maximum.

First, let's compute the number of wins if I keep my cow at position k.

In this case, position is k, and I need to see how many wins my cow gets in the original sequence.

To compute this, I need to see:

- The winner of match k-1 is the highest-rated cow among the first k-1 cows.

- If my cow's rating > winner of match k-1, then it wins match k and proceeds to win matches against subsequent cows until it loses.

So, in the original sequence, I can compute the number of wins for my cow at position k.

Similarly, if I swap my cow with another position p, then my cow is at position p, and I need to compute the number of wins in this new sequence.

I need to do this for all possible p and choose the maximum number of wins.

But with n up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, this is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me try to find a way to compute the maximum number of wins in O(1) or O(log n) time per test case.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute some prefix and suffix arrays.

Let me define:

- prefix_max[p]: the maximum rating among the first p-1 cows.

- suffix_higher[p]: the position of the first cow after p with rating > my cow's rating.

Then, for each position p, if my cow's rating > prefix_max[p], then the number of wins is suffix_higher[p] - p.

Otherwise, it's 0.

So, I need to find p where my cow's rating > prefix_max[p], and maximize suffix_higher[p] - p.

So, I need to choose p as small as possible where my cow's rating > prefix_max[p], and among those, choose the p where suffix_higher[p] is maximized.

But computing suffix_higher for all p would take O(n^2), which is too slow.

Is there a way to compute suffix_higher efficiently?

Yes, I can use a stack to compute for each position p, the next higher rating after p.

This is a standard next greater element problem, which can be computed in O(n) time using a stack.

So, I can precompute for each position p, the position q where ratings[q] > ratings[p].

Then, for each possible position p, if my cow's rating > prefix_max[p], then the number of wins is q - p, where q is the next higher position after p.

Otherwise, it's 0.

So, I can precompute prefix_max and next_higher for all positions.

Then, for each possible position p, compute the number of wins if my cow is at p, and choose the maximum among all p.

But n is up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, and per test case, computing prefix_max and next_higher takes O(n), which would be too slow for the total constraints.

Wait, but t * n = 1e4 * 1e5 = 1e9 operations, which is too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix my cow's rating, say r_k.

Then, I need to choose a position p such that:

- r_k > prefix_max[p-1], meaning r_k > max(ratings[1 to p-1]).

- Then, the number of wins is the number of cows from position p to the first position q where ratings[q] > r_k.

So, the number of wins is q - p.

To maximize q - p, I need to choose p as small as possible where r_k > prefix_max[p-1], and q as large as possible.

Wait, but q depends on p.

So, perhaps I can find the smallest p where r_k > prefix_max[p-1], and then find q as the smallest position > p where ratings[q] > r_k.

Then, the number of wins is q - p.

But I need to maximize q - p over all such p.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider all positions where ratings[q] > r_k, and choose p to be the smallest p >=1 where p < q and r_k > prefix_max[p-1].

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that the smallest p where r_k > prefix_max[p-1] is the smallest p where r_k > all ratings before p.

So, p is the smallest position where r_k is greater than all positions before it.

Then, for such p, q is the smallest position > p where ratings[q] > r_k.

So, the number of wins is q - p.

To maximize q - p, I need to choose p as small as possible, and q as large as possible.

But q depends on p.

Wait, maybe I can find the position p where p is the smallest position where r_k > prefix_max[p-1], and then find the largest possible q where ratings[q] > r_k.

But q depends on p, it has to be > p.

Wait, perhaps I can find for each p where r_k > prefix_max[p-1], the corresponding q, and choose the p that maximizes q - p.

But this seems too slow for the constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that if I place my cow at position p, and its rating > prefix_max[p-1], then it will win matches from p to q-1, where q is the smallest position > p where ratings[q] > r_k.

So, the number of wins is q - p.

To maximize q - p, I need to choose p as small as possible where r_k > prefix_max[p-1], and q is as large as possible.

So, perhaps I can find the smallest p where r_k > prefix_max[p-1], and then find q as the smallest position > p where ratings[q] > r_k.

But to maximize q - p, I need to maximize q for the smallest possible p.

Wait, perhaps I can consider two cases:

1. Keep my cow at position k.

2. Swap my cow with another position p to maximize the number of wins.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that in the original sequence, if I don't swap, the number of wins for my cow at position k is:

- If r_k > prefix_max[k-1], then wins = q - k, where q is the smallest position > k where ratings[q] > r_k.

- Else, wins = 0.

Similarly, if I swap my cow with position p, then in the new sequence, my cow is at position p, and the number of wins is:

- If r_k > prefix_max[p-1], then wins = q - p, where q is the smallest position > p where ratings[q] > r_k.

- Else, wins = 0.

So, I need to compute for all p, the wins if I place my cow at p, and choose the maximum.

But this is too slow for the constraints.

Is there a way to compute this faster?

Let me consider that the optimal position p to place my cow is either:

- Its original position k.

- Or, the position where it can be placed just after the group of cows with lower ratings than it.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think about the tournament in terms of the sequence of cows.

The tournament proceeds from position 1 to n, with each match being between the current winner and the next cow.

The current winner progresses if it has a higher rating.

So, the number of wins for my cow is determined by how many cows with lower ratings are after its position, provided that it can reach those matches by winning against the previous winner.

This seems complex.

Let me consider that the key is to place my cow in a position where it can avoid being blocked by higher-rated cows before it, and then face as many lower-rated cows as possible after it.

So, placing my cow earlier is better, but only if it can beat the previous winner.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the best position for my cow is the smallest p where r_k > prefix_max[p-1].

Because placing it earlier allows it to face more cows, but only if it can beat the previous winner.

Once I find the smallest p where r_k > prefix_max[p-1], then the number of wins is the number of cows after p with ratings < r_k, until the first cow with rating > r_k.

So, perhaps I can compute this for the original position and for the position where p is the smallest possible where r_k > prefix_max[p-1].

Wait, but I can only perform one swap.

So, perhaps I can consider swapping my cow with a cow before it or after it to optimize its position.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look at the provided code and see what approach it's taking.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

s = list(map(int, input().split()))

(s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])

ans = 0

h = s[0]

j = -1

for i in s[1:]:

j += 1

if h < i:

break

else:

ans += 1

p = j

(s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])

ans1 = 0

(s[p], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[p])

z = 0

for i in s:

if i == h:

if s[0] != h:

ans1 += 1

z = 1

elif i > h:

break

elif z == 1:

ans1 += 1

print(max(ans, ans1))

So, the code seems to be trying two scenarios:

1. Swap my cow to position 1 and see how many wins it gets.

2. Swap my cow to the position where it can win against the highest possible cows.

But it's not clear what exactly it's doing.

Let me try to understand the code step by step.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the list s of ratings.

- Swap s[0] and s[k-1]. So, s[0] now contains my cow's rating.

- Initialize ans = 0, h = s[0] (my cow's rating), j = -1.

- Loop through s[1:]:

- j +=1

- If h < s[j+1], break.

- Else, ans +=1

- Set p = j

- Swap s[0] and s[k-1] back to original positions.

- Set ans1 = 0

- Swap s[p] and s[k-1]

- Set z =0

- Loop through s:

- If i == h:

- If s[0] !=h:

- ans1 +=1

- z =1

- Elif i > h:

- Break

- Elif z ==1:

- ans1 +=1

- Print max(ans, ans1)

Wait, this seems confusing.

Let me try to understand what it's doing.

First, it swaps s[0] and s[k-1], so that s[0] is now my cow's rating.

Then, it sets h = s[0], which is my cow's rating.

Then, it iterates through s[1:]:

- For each cow, if my cow's rating > cow's rating, ans +=1.

- If my cow's rating < cow's rating, break.

So, ans is the number of consecutive cows after position 1 that my cow can beat.

Then, it sets p = j, which is the index where my cow would lose.

Then, it swaps s[0] and s[k-1] back to original positions.

Then, it swaps s[p] and s[k-1].

Then, it iterates through s:

- If i == h:

- If s[0] != h:

- ans1 +=1

- z =1

- Elif i > h:

- Break

- Elif z ==1:

- ans1 +=1

This seems very convoluted.

I think this code is trying to consider two scenarios:

1. Swapping my cow to position 1 and seeing how many wins it gets.

2. Swapping my cow to the position where it can beat the maximum number of cows.

But it's not clear, and I suspect it might not be correct.

Let me consider the first test case:

n=6, k=1

ratings=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

Swapping s[0] and s[0], which is doing nothing.

Then, h=12

Loop through s[1:]:

10 <12, ans=1

14 >12, break

p=1

Then, swap s[1] and s[0]: s becomes [10,12,14,11,8,3]

Then, iterate through s:

10 ==12? No

12 ==12, and s[0] !=12, so ans1 +=1, z=1

14 >12, break

So, ans1=1

Then, max(ans, ans1)=max(1,1)=1

Which matches the first test case.

Second test case:

n=6, k=5

ratings=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

Swap s[0] and s[4]: s becomes [12,2,727,10,7,13]

h=12

Loop through s[1:]:

2 <12, ans=1

727 >12, break

p=1

Swap s[0] and s[4] back: s=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

Swap s[1] and s[4]: s=[7,12,727,10,2,13]

Iterate through s:

7 ==12? No

12 ==12 and s[0]!=12, ans1 +=1, z=1

727 >12, break

So, ans1=1

But according to the explanation, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps it's wrong.

Wait, in the explanation, by swapping k=5 to position 3, which is s[2], not s[1].

But in the code, p=1, so it's swapping s[1] and s[4].

Wait, maybe it's incorrect.

I think the code is flawed because it only considers swapping my cow to position 1 and to position p where it loses, but it doesn't consider all possible positions.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
