Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's a game where I'm at point 0 on a straight line, and there are n monsters with certain health levels located at different points on this line. Every second, I can shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, decreasing their health by 1 each. After I shoot, any monster with health 0 or less dies. Then, all living monsters move one point closer to me. If any monster reaches point 0, I lose. I need to figure out if I can eliminate all monsters before any of them reaches me.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events each second:

1. I shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, subtracting 1 health per bullet.

2. Monsters with health <= 0 die.

3. Remaining monsters move one step closer to me.

My goal is to ensure that no monster reaches point 0 before I eliminate all of them.

Given that, I need a strategy to allocate my bullets each second to maximize the elimination of monsters before they get to me.

Let me think about the constraints:

- n can be up to 3*10^5 per test case, and t up to 3*10^4, but the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3*10^5. So, overall time complexity needs to be careful, probably O(n log n) per test case.

- Positions are unique, non-zero, and sorted: x1 < x2 < ... < xn, with x_i != 0.

- Healths a_i can be up to 10^9.

I need to model the movement and elimination of monsters over time.

An idea is to simulate the process step by step, but with n up to 3*10^5, simulation per second isn't feasible due to time constraints. So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the time each monster will take to reach me, based on its initial position.

For a monster at position x_i, the time to reach me is |x_i| seconds, since each second it moves one step closer.

So, monster i will reach me in t = |x_i| seconds if not eliminated.

Therefore, I need to ensure that monster i is eliminated before t = |x_i| seconds.

But I can shoot up to k bullets per second, and each bullet can target any alive monster.

I need to distribute my bullets over time to ensure that, for each monster, I eliminate it before it reaches me.

This sounds like a scheduling problem where I have to allocate my bullet shots over time to meet the deadlines (elimination before they reach me).

Let me think about it in terms of the latest time I can eliminate each monster.

For monster i, the latest time I can eliminate it is t = |x_i| - 1 seconds.

Because at t = |x_i| - 1, after I shoot, the monster moves one more step to reach me, but since I eliminated it before shooting, it's already dead.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- At second t, I shoot bullets, monsters that are eliminated die, then remaining monsters move one step closer.

- So, if a monster is eliminated at second t, it doesn't move at that second.

Therefore, to prevent a monster at x_i from reaching me, I need to eliminate it no later than t = |x_i| - 1 seconds.

Because:

- At t = |x_i| - 1, I eliminate it, and at the end of this second, it wouldn't move, since it's eliminated.

- If I eliminate it at t = |x_i|, it would have moved to position 0 before being eliminated, which is too late.

Hence, each monster i has a deadline of t_i = |x_i| - 1.

I need to ensure that the sum of the healths of all monsters that are still alive at time t does not exceed k * t for any t.

Wait, that might not be directly applicable.

Alternatively, I can think of it as a resource allocation problem, where each monster requires a certain amount of bullet shots before a certain time.

I need to schedule my bullet shots (up to k per second) to meet these requirements.

An efficient way to handle this is to process the monsters based on their deadlines, from the earliest to the latest.

In other words, handle the monsters that have the smallest t_i first, because they are the most urgent.

To do this, I can sort the monsters based on |x_i| in ascending order, since smaller |x_i| means smaller t_i.

Wait, no. Since t_i = |x_i| - 1, sorting by |x_i| ascending is equivalent to sorting t_i ascending.

So, I can sort the monsters by their distance from me, |x_i|, in ascending order.

Then, process them one by one, ensuring that I have enough bullet shots allocated before their deadline.

Let me formalize this.

Let's sort the monsters in order of increasing |x_i|.

Initialize a variable to keep track of the current time, starting from 0.

For each monster in this order:

Calculate its deadline t_i = |x_i| - 1.

Ensure that by time t_i, I have allocated enough bullet shots to eliminate this monster.

To allocate bullet shots, I can distribute them over the available time before t_i.

But to optimize, I can allocate as late as possible, i.e., starting from t = t_i down to t = 0.

But maybe a better way is to keep track of the remaining health of monsters and the available bullet shots per second.

An efficient way is to use a priority queue or to process monsters in order of their deadlines.

Wait, perhaps a sweep line algorithm can be used here.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort the monsters by their |x_i| in ascending order.

- Initialize a variable to keep track of the total health that needs to be eliminated up to the current time.

- Iterate through the sorted list, and for each monster, calculate the time available to eliminate it (t_i = |x_i| - 1).

- Ensure that the cumulative health up to that point can be eliminated within the available bullet shots up to time t_i.

- If at any point the cumulative health exceeds k * t_i, then it's impossible.

This seems similar to the classic activity selection or scheduling problems.

Let me try to formalize it.

Letâ€™s define:

- Sort the monsters by |x_i| in ascending order.

- For each monster, compute t_i = |x_i| - 1.

- Maintain a running sum of a_i, and check if this sum is <= k * t_i.

Wait, but this might not account for the fact that bullet shots are allocated over time.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through time steps, but that would be too slow for n up to 3*10^5.

An optimization is needed.

Let me consider that for each monster, I need to allocate its health a_i within t_i seconds.

And across all monsters, I can shoot up to k bullets per second.

So, for each time step t from 0 to the maximum t_i, I need to ensure that the total bullet shots allocated across all monsters do not exceed k per second.

But iterating through each second is too slow.

An alternative is to use a priority queue to manage the monsters based on their deadlines.

But perhaps there's a better way.

I recall that in some scheduling problems, we can use the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm.

In EDF, we schedule tasks in order of their deadlines, and assign resources accordingly.

Similarly, here, I can sort the monsters by their t_i (deadlines) in ascending order.

Then, iterate through the sorted list, and for each monster, calculate the remaining bullet shots available up to its deadline.

I need to keep track of the total health that needs to be eliminated by each deadline.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

1. Sort the monsters by |x_i| in ascending order.

2. Initialize a variable to track the current time, starting from 0.

3. Initialize a variable to track the total health that needs to be eliminated by the current time.

4. For each monster in the sorted list:

a. Compute t_i = |x_i| - 1.

b. If t_i < current_time, it's too late to eliminate this monster, so return False.

c. Else, add a_i to the total health that needs to be eliminated by t_i.

d. If total health > k * t_i, return False.

e. Update current_time to t_i.

5. If all monsters are processed without violating the condition, return True.

Wait, but this might not be accurate because the total health should be eliminated by t_i, and with k bullets per second, the maximum bullets available by t_i is k * t_i.

So, the condition total health <= k * t_i should hold for each t_i.

But I need to make sure that the total health required by time t_i doesn't exceed the bullets available up to that time.

Moreover, I need to handle the cumulative health properly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort all monsters by their |x_i| in ascending order.

Then, for each monster, I have a deadline t_i = |x_i| - 1.

I need to eliminate the monster within t_i seconds.

Given that I can shoot up to k bullets per second, the maximum number of bullets I can allocate to this monster is k * t_i.

But since multiple monsters share the same bullet shots, I need to ensure that the total health of all monsters with deadlines <= t_i can be eliminated with the bullets available up to time t_i.

So, I need to iterate through the sorted list, maintaining a running sum of health, and for each t_i, check if the running sum <= k * t_i.

If this condition holds for all monsters, then it's possible; else, it's not.

Let me formalize this:

- Sort the monsters by |x_i| in ascending order.

- Initialize a variable total_health = 0.

- For each monster in this order:

- Compute t_i = |x_i| - 1.

- total_health += a_i.

- If total_health > k * t_i, return False.

- Return True.

This seems straightforward.

Let me verify it with the first example.

Example 1:

3 2

1 2 3

-1 2 3

So, n=3, k=2.

Monsters:

- Monster 1: a=1, x=-1, |x|=1, t=0.

- Monster 2: a=2, x=2, |x|=2, t=1.

- Monster 3: a=3, x=3, |x|=3, t=2.

Sort by |x|: Monster 1 (t=0), Monster 2 (t=1), Monster 3 (t=2).

Initialize total_health = 0.

- For Monster 1: total_health +=1. Check 1 <= 2*0? 1 <= 0? No. So, return False.

Wait, but in the example, it's possible to win.

Hmm, seems like my condition is too strict.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the way I calculate t_i.

Let me think again.

In the first second:

- Shoot 1 bullet at Monster 1 and 1 at Monster 3.

- Monster 1's health becomes 0, dies.

- Monster 3's health becomes 2.

- Monster 2 moves to x=1, Monster 3 moves to x=2.

In the second second:

- Shoot 2 bullets at Monster 2.

- Monster 2's health becomes 0, dies.

- Monster 3 moves to x=1.

In the third second:

- Shoot 2 bullets at Monster 3.

- Monster 3's health becomes 0, dies.

So, in this scenario, it's possible.

But according to my earlier condition, for Monster 1: t=0, total_health=1 > k*t=2*0=0, which is not satisfied.

But in reality, it's possible.

So, my condition is too strict.

I need to fix this.

Perhaps I need to consider that at time t=0, I can shoot k bullets, and monsters with t_i=0 need to be eliminated solely with the bullets allocated at t=0.

But in this example, Monster 1 has t_i=0, so I need to eliminate it with the bullets allocated at t=0.

Given k=2, I can allocate 2 bullets at t=0, but Monster 1 only needs 1 bullet.

So, it's possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to accumulate bullet shots over time.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the cumulative bullet shots up to each t_i.

Let me think differently.

Letâ€™s consider that for each time t from 0 to T (maximum t_i), I have k bullets available.

I need to allocate these k bullets per second to the monsters in such a way that each monster receives enough bullets before its deadline.

This sounds like a resource allocation over time.

An efficient way to handle this is to use a priority queue to always allocate bullets to the monster with the earliest deadline.

This is similar to the EDF scheduling algorithm.

Here's how it can work:

- Sort the monsters by their t_i in ascending order.

- Use a priority queue (max-heap) to keep track of the health requirements of monsters.

- Initialize total_available_bullets = 0.

- For each time t from 0 to T:

- Add k bullets to total_available_bullets.

- While there are monsters with t_i == t:

- Add their health requirements to the priority queue.

- While total_available_bullets >= the health of the monster with the highest health in the queue:

- Subtract its health from total_available_bullets.

- Remove the monster from the queue.

- If at any point, total_available_bullets < the health of the monster with the highest health in the queue, return False.

- After processing all times, if the queue is empty, return True.

But this seems a bit complicated, and may not be efficient enough for n up to 3*10^5.

I need a better way.

Let me look for a mathematical approach.

Suppose I group monsters by their t_i.

For each t_i, I have a certain amount of health that needs to be eliminated by time t_i.

The total health that needs to be eliminated by time t_i is the sum of a_j for all monsters with t_j <= t_i.

Given that, I need to ensure that for each t_i, sum(a_j for j where t_j <= t_i) <= k * t_i.

If this holds for all t_i, then it's possible; otherwise, it's not.

This is similar to the condition I thought earlier, but perhaps I need to sort the monsters correctly.

Wait, in the first example:

- t_i for Monster 1: t=0, a=1.

- Check: sum(a_j for j where t_j <=0) = 1 <= 2*0 = 0? 1 > 0, so condition fails.

But in reality, it's possible.

So, my condition is too strict.

I need to adjust it.

Perhaps I need to consider that at t=0, I can allocate up to k bullets, and any remaining bullets can be used in future seconds.

Wait, but in reality, bullets are allocated per second, and each second, I can shoot up to k bullets at any monsters.

So, I need to distribute the bullets over time such that the cumulative bullets allocated to each monster meet its health requirement before its deadline.

This sounds like a feasibility problem in linear programming, but that's too slow for this problem.

An efficient way to handle this is to use the concept of cumulative bullet requirements.

Let me try this approach:

- Sort the monsters by their t_i in ascending order.

- Initialize a variable total_health = 0.

- Initialize a variable time = 0.

- For each monster in sorted order:

- time = t_i

- total_health += a_i

- if total_health > k * time, return False

- Return True

But in the first example, this fails as explained earlier.

Wait, maybe I need to track the cumulative bullet requirements more accurately.

Let me consider that for each t_i, the total health that needs to be eliminated by that time is the sum of a_j for all j with t_j <= t_i.

And the total bullets available by time t_i is k * t_i.

So, the condition sum(a_j for j with t_j <= t_i) <= k * t_i for all i should hold.

In the first example:

- t_i=0: sum(a_j for j with t_j <=0) = 1 <= 2*0 = 0? 1 > 0, condition fails.

But in reality, it's possible because I can allocate 1 bullet at t=0 to Monster 1, and have 1 bullet left, which can be used later.

So, my earlier condition is too strict.

I need to find a better way to model this.

Let me consider that the bullets can be allocated flexibly over time, as long as the total bullets allocated to each monster meet its health requirement before its deadline.

This is similar to scheduling jobs with deadlines and resource constraints.

An efficient algorithm for this is to use the earliest deadline first (EDF) approach.

Here's how it can be applied:

- Sort the monsters by their t_i in ascending order.

- Initialize a priority queue (max-heap) based on the health of the monsters.

- Initialize a variable time = 0.

- Initialize a variable available_bullets = 0.

- For each monster in sorted order:

- time = t_i

- available_bullets += k * (time - previous_time)

- previous_time = time

- Add a_i to the priority queue.

- While available_bullets >= the health of the monster with the highest health in the queue:

- Subtract its health from available_bullets.

- Remove the monster from the queue.

- If at any point, available_bullets < the health of the monster with the highest health in the queue, return False.

- After processing all monsters, if the queue is empty, return True.

This way, I ensure that I allocate bullets to the monsters with the highest health first, which might help in meeting their deadlines.

But I need to verify this with the first example.

First example:

Monsters:

- Monster 1: t_i=0, a=1

- Monster 2: t_i=1, a=2

- Monster 3: t_i=2, a=3

Initialize:

- time = 0

- available_bullets = 0

- priority queue empty

Process Monster 1:

- time = 0

- available_bullets += k * (0 - 0) = 0

- Add a=1 to priority queue

- available_bullets >= 1? 0 >=1? No, so cannot eliminate Monster 1.

- Return False

But in reality, it's possible.

So, my approach is still flawed.

I need to adjust it.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through time steps from t=0 to t=T (maximum t_i), and at each time step, I allocate up to k bullets to the monsters that are still alive and have t_i >= current time.

But with n up to 3*10^5, iterating through each time step is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the total number of bullets required is the sum of a_i for all monsters.

And the total number of bullets available is k * T, where T is the maximum t_i.

But this isn't necessarily correct, because bullets need to be allocated before their deadlines.

Wait, perhaps I can use binary search to find the minimal k that allows me to eliminate all monsters in time.

But that might not be straightforward.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I sort the monsters by their t_i in ascending order.

Then, for each monster, I need to ensure that its health is eliminated by its t_i.

Given that, I can calculate the minimum k required to eliminate the cumulative health up to each t_i.

So, for each t_i, the minimum k required is ceil(sum(a_j for j with t_j <= t_i) / t_i).

Then, I can take the maximum of these minimum k's and check if it's less than or equal to the given k.

If it is, then it's possible; otherwise, it's not.

Wait, but in the first example:

- t_i=0: sum(a_j for j with t_j <=0) =1, t_i=0. But division by zero.

Hmm, so I need to handle t_i=0 separately.

If t_i=0, then I need to eliminate the monster with 0 seconds, which means I need to allocate all its health in t=0.

Given that, I can adjust the formula to:

For each t_i, check if sum(a_j for j with t_j < t_i) <= k * (t_i -1), and sum(a_j for j with t_j <= t_i) <= k * t_i.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can group the monsters by their t_i and calculate the cumulative health up to each t_i and check if it's <= k * t_i.

In the first example:

- t_i=0: sum(a_j for j with t_j <=0) =1 <= 2*0 =0? No.

But in reality, it's possible.

So, my condition is too strict.

I need to find a better way.

Let me look at the second example:

2 1

1 1

-1 1

Monsters:

- Monster 1: a=1, x=-1, t_i=0

- Monster 2: a=1, x=1, t_i=0

At t=0, I can shoot only one bullet, so I can eliminate only one monster.

The other monster will still be alive and move to x=0 in the next second, killing me.

So, it's impossible.

In this case, sum(a_j for j with t_j <=0) =2 >1*0=0, so according to my earlier condition, it's impossible, which matches the reality.

But in the first example, sum(a_j for j with t_j <=0)=1 >2*0=0, but in reality, it's possible.

So, my condition is too strict.

I need to adjust it.

Let me consider that for t_i=0, I need to eliminate the monster immediately with the available k bullets.

So, for t_i=0, sum(a_j for j with t_j <=0) <= k.

In the first example, sum=1 <=2, which is true.

For t_i=1, sum=1+2=3 <=2*1=2? 3>2, which is false.

But in reality, it's possible.

Wait, but in reality, at t=0, I can eliminate Monster 1 with 1 bullet, and have 1 bullet left.

Then, at t=1, I have k=2 bullets available, and Monster 2's health is 2, which I can eliminate exactly.

So, sum(a_j for j with t_j <=1) =3 <=2*1=2? 3>2, which is false, but in reality, it's possible.

So, my condition is still too strict.

I need to find a better way.

Let me think about the total number of bullets required over time.

At t=0, I have k=2 bullets.

- Eliminate Monster 1 with 1 bullet, have 1 bullet left.

- Allocate that 1 bullet to Monster 3, reducing its health to 2.

At t=1, I have another k=2 bullets.

- Monster 2 is now at x=1 with health=2.

- Monster 3 is now at x=2 with health=2.

- Allocate 2 bullets to Monster 2, eliminating it.

At t=2, I have another k=2 bullets.

- Monster 3 is now at x=1 with health=0, already eliminated.

So, all monsters are eliminated before reaching me.

In this scenario, the cumulative health up to t=0 is 1, which is <=2*0=0, which is not true.

But in reality, I only need to allocate 1 bullet at t=0, and the remaining bullet can be used for future monsters.

So, perhaps I need to track the allocation of bullets over time more carefully.

An alternative approach is to consider the problem as a rate problem.

I need to eliminate a certain amount of health before certain times.

So, the required elimination rate is the total health that needs to be eliminated by a certain time divided by that time.

I need to ensure that at no point is the required elimination rate higher than k.

So, for each t_i, the sum of a_j for j with t_j <= t_i should be <= k * t_i.

But as seen in the first example, this condition is too strict.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the way I calculate t_i.

Let me consider t_i = |x_i|.

So, monster i will reach me at t = |x_i|.

I need to eliminate it before that, i.e., by t = |x_i| -1.

So, for each monster, its deadline is t_i = |x_i| -1.

So, in the first example:

- Monster 1: |x|=1, t_i=0

- Monster 2: |x|=2, t_i=1

- Monster 3: |x|=3, t_i=2

Total health by t_i=0: 1 <= 2*0 =0? No.

But in reality, it's possible.

So, perhaps I need to consider that at t=0, I can allocate up to k bullets to monsters with t_i=0.

Then, for t_i=1, I can allocate up to k*1=2 bullets to monsters with t_i<=1.

But I need to account for the bullets allocated in previous steps.

Wait, maybe I need to keep track of the cumulative bullets allocated up to each time step.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that in some similar problems, a sweep line algorithm is used.

So, I can think of a timeline from t=0 to t=T, and at each t_i, I have monsters that need to be eliminated by that time.

I can sort all the events (monster deadlines) and track the cumulative health and cumulative bullets available.

Let me try this.

- Sort the monsters by t_i in ascending order.

- Initialize a variable total_health = 0.

- Initialize a variable total_bullets = 0.

- For each t from 0 to T:

- Add k bullets to total_bullets.

- For each monster with t_i == t:

- Add a_i to total_health.

- If total_bullets < total_health:

- Return False

- Else:

- Subtract a_i from total_health (as it's eliminated)

- After processing all times, return True

In the first example:

- t=0:

- Add k=2 to total_bullets: total_bullets=2

- Monster 1: t_i=0, a=1; add 1 to total_health: total_health=1

- total_bullets (2) >= total_health (1): yes

- Subtract 1 from total_health: total_health=0

- t=1:

- Add k=2 to total_bullets: total_bullets=4

- Monster 2: t_i=1, a=2; add 2 to total_health: total_health=2

- total_bullets (4) >= total_health (2): yes

- Subtract 2 from total_health: total_health=0

- t=2:

- Add k=2 to total_bullets: total_bullets=6

- Monster 3: t_i=2, a=3; add 3 to total_health: total_health=3

- total_bullets (6) >= total_health (3): yes

- Subtract 3 from total_health: total_health=0

- All monsters are eliminated, so return True.

This seems to work for the first example.

Let's check the second example:

2 1

1 1

-1 1

- t=0:

- Add k=1 to total_bullets: total_bullets=1

- Monster 1: t_i=0, a=1; add 1 to total_health: total_health=1

- total_bullets (1) >= total_health (1): yes

- Subtract 1 from total_health: total_health=0

- Monster 2: t_i=0, a=1; add 1 to total_health: total_health=1

- total_bullets (1) >= total_health (1): yes

- Subtract 1 from total_health: total_health=0

- But in reality, it's impossible because both monsters reach t=0, but according to this, it's possible.

Wait, this approach is flawed because it allows allocating bullets to monsters beyond their deadlines.

In the second example, at t=0, I have to eliminate both monsters with k=1 bullet.

But in reality, I can only eliminate one monster, and the other will reach me.

So, this approach is too lenient.

I need to adjust it.

Perhaps I need to group monsters by their t_i and ensure that the total health for monsters with t_i == t is <= k.

But that might not be sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the cumulative health up to each t_i and ensure that it's <= k * t_i.

But I already tried that and it was too strict.

This is getting tricky.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

I found that this problem can be solved using the concept of maximum flow or linear programming, but that's too slow for this problem's constraints.

Another idea is to use binary search on the minimal k required to eliminate all monsters.

But again, with n up to 3*10^5, it needs to be efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the minimal k required and check if it's <= the given k.

To calculate the minimal k, I can iterate through the monsters sorted by t_i and ensure that the cumulative health is <= k * t_i for each t_i.

But as seen earlier, this is too strict.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the minimal k as the maximum over all t_i of (sum(a_j for j with t_j <= t_i)) / t_i.

But division might lead to floating points, which is not desirable.

Moreover, t_i could be 0, so I need to handle that case separately.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a value of k and check if it's possible to eliminate all monsters before any reaches me.

I need an efficient way to verify this.

An efficient way is to sort the monsters by their t_i and ensure that the cumulative health up to each t_i can be eliminated with k * t_i bullets.

In other words, for each t_i, sum(a_j for j with t_j <= t_i) <= k * t_i.

If this holds for all t_i, then it's possible; else, it's not.

In the first example:

- t_i=0: sum=1 <= 2*0=0? No.

But in reality, it's possible.

So, my condition is too strict.

I need to adjust it.

Perhaps I need to consider that at t=0, I can allocate up to k bullets, and any remaining bullets can be used in future time steps.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the surplus bullets.

Let me try this:

- Sort the monsters by t_i in ascending order.

- Initialize a variable surplus_bullets = 0.

- For each t_i in sorted order:

- Add k bullets to surplus_bullets.

- Subtract a_i from surplus_bullets.

- If surplus_bullets <0 at any point, return False.

- Return True.

In the first example:

- t_i=0:

- Add k=2: surplus_bullets=2

- Subtract a=1: surplus_bullets=1

- t_i=1:

- Add k=2: surplus_bullets=3

- Subtract a=2: surplus_bullets=1

- t_i=2:

- Add k=2: surplus_bullets=3

- Subtract a=3: surplus_bullets=0

- All done, return True.

This matches the reality.

In the second example:

- t_i=0:

- Add k=1: surplus_bullets=1

-
