Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example to see. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3]. The beauty would be (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. Another example, [3, 1, 2], beauty would be (1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = -1. So, it's possible to have negative beauty as well.

But the problem asks for the maximum beauty that can be obtained by rearranging the array. So, I need to find a way to arrange the elements so that this sum is as large as possible.

Let me think about how to maximize this sum. Each term in the sum is (a_i - a_{i-1}). If I look at the entire sum, it's like:

(a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + (a4 - a3) + ... + (an - a_{n-1})

If I write this out, I see that most terms cancel out:

= a2 - a1 + a3 - a2 + a4 - a3 + ... + an - a_{n-1}

= -a1 + an

So, the entire sum simplifies to an - a1, where a1 is the first element and an is the last element in the arranged array.

Wait, that's interesting! So, no matter how I arrange the array, the beauty is simply the last element minus the first element in the arranged order.

If that's the case, then to maximize the beauty, I need to maximize (an - a1). Which means I want an to be as large as possible and a1 to be as small as possible.

So, the best way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order. That way, the smallest element is first, and the largest element is last. Then, beauty = largest - smallest.

Let me check this with the examples given.

First test case:

3

2 1 3

If I sort it to [1, 2, 3], beauty = 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the example.

Second test case:

3

69 69 69

Sorted array [69, 69, 69], beauty = 69 - 69 = 0, which matches the example.

Third test case:

5

100 54 80 43 90

Sorted array [43, 54, 80, 90, 100], beauty = 100 - 43 = 57, which matches the example.

Fourth test case:

4

3 4 3 3

Sorted array [3, 3, 3, 4], beauty = 4 - 3 = 1, which matches the example.

Fifth test case:

2

2 1

Sorted array [1, 2], beauty = 2 - 1 = 1, which matches the example.

So, in all the examples, sorting the array in ascending order and taking the difference between the last and first elements gives the correct beauty.

Wait a minute, is there any case where this wouldn't hold? Let's think about it.

Suppose the array has negative numbers as well. For example:

n = 3

a = [ -1, 0, -2 ]

Sorted array: [ -2, -1, 0 ]

Beauty = 0 - (-2) = 2

Is there any other arrangement that could give a higher beauty? Let's try:

Arrangement: [ -1, -2, 0 ]

Beauty = (-2 - (-1)) + (0 - (-2)) = (-1) + 2 = 1, which is less than 2.

Another arrangement: [ 0, -1, -2 ]

Beauty = (-1 - 0) + (-2 - (-1)) = (-1) + (-1) = -2, which is worse.

So, in this case, sorting gives the maximum beauty.

Another case: n=4, a=[1, 5, 3, 7]

Sorted array: [1, 3, 5, 7], beauty = 7 - 1 = 6

Another arrangement: [1, 7, 3, 5]

Beauty = (7-1) + (3-7) + (5-3) = 6 + (-4) + 2 = 4, which is less than 6.

Yet another arrangement: [3, 1, 5, 7]

Beauty = (1-3) + (5-1) + (7-5) = (-2) + 4 + 2 = 4, still less than 6.

So, it seems that sorting the array in ascending order and taking the difference between the last and first elements always gives the maximum beauty.

Therefore, the program provided is correct. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the array a, sorts a in ascending order, and prints the difference between the last and first elements.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
