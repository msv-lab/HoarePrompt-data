Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a permutation of length n, and I have the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums. I need to find out how many different permutations could have these specific prefix and suffix maximum indices. The answer should be modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what prefix and suffix maximums are. A prefix maximum at position i means that the element at i is greater than all elements before it. Similarly, a suffix maximum at position i means that the element at i is greater than all elements after it.

Given that, I have the indices of these prefix and suffix maximums, and I need to figure out how many permutations satisfy these conditions.

Let's look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the second test case:

n=4, m1=2, m2=3

prefix maximum indices: 1,2

suffix maximum indices: 2,3,4

The suitable permutations are:

[1,4,3,2]

[2,4,3,1]

[3,4,2,1]

So, there are 3 possible permutations that match these prefix and suffix maximum indices.

I need to find a general way to calculate this for any given n, m1, m2, p, and s.

Looking at the program provided, it seems to be attempting to calculate this using combinatorics, possibly involving factorials and some kind of counting principle.

Let's break down the program step by step.

First, it precomputes factorials up to 2*10^5 modulo 10^9+7 and stores them in the list 'facts'.

Then, for each test case, it reads n, m1, m2, the list p of prefix maximum indices, and the list s of suffix maximum indices.

It checks if the last prefix maximum index is equal to the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1, and the last suffix maximum index is n. If not, it prints 0, meaning no permutations satisfy the conditions.

This makes sense because:

- The first element is always a prefix maximum, so p[0] should be 1.

- The last element is always a suffix maximum, so s[-1] should be n.

- The last prefix maximum should be the first suffix maximum, as that element is both a prefix and suffix maximum, which should be the maximum element in the permutation.

If any of these conditions fail, there are no valid permutations, hence output 0.

If these conditions are satisfied, it proceeds to calculate the number of valid permutations.

It initializes 'ans' to 1, which will hold the final answer.

It then initializes 'kol' to n, which seems to be used to track some remaining positions.

It iterates through the suffix maximum indices (s), starting from the first one (s[0]) to the last one (s[-1]).

For each suffix maximum index x in s, it calculates some combinatorial value 'cnk' using the 'func_2' function, which likely computes combinations or some related value.

It multiplies 'ans' by 'cnk' and takes modulo 10^9+7.

Then, it updates 'kol' to n - x.

Similarly, it handles the prefix maximum indices by reversing a part of p and iterating through them, calculating 'cnk' and updating 'ans' accordingly.

Finally, it multiplies 'ans' by the factorials of the differences between consecutive p and s indices, taking modulo 10^9+7 each time.

At the end, it prints 'ans'.

Now, I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First, the checks at the beginning seem accurate: p[-1] should equal s[0], p[0] should be 1, and s[-1] should be n.

Next, the calculation of 'ans' involves combinatorial choices.

I need to understand what 'kol' represents and how 'cnk' is being calculated.

'kol' seems to represent the number of elements remaining to be placed in certain positions.

'cnk' is calculated using 'func_2', which likely computes combinations or some related value using modular inverse.

'func_1' seems to be implementing the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse.

'func_2' uses 'func_1' to compute the modular inverse of b modulo 10^9+7 and then multiplies it by a, taking modulo 10^9+7.

This is likely to compute a/b modulo 10^9+7.

In the main loop, for each suffix maximum index x, it computes 'cnk' as facts[kol - 1] / (facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n]), but I think there might be a mistake here.

Similarly, for prefix maximum indices, it computes 'cnk' as facts[kol - 1] / (facts[x - 1] * facts[kol - x]).

I need to verify if these combinatorial calculations are correct.

Moreover, it multiplies 'ans' by the factorials of the differences between consecutive p and s indices.

I'm not entirely sure if this is the right approach.

Let me think differently.

I recall that in a permutation, the prefix maximums correspond to the positions where a new maximum is achieved.

Similarly, suffix maximums correspond to positions where a new maximum is achieved from the end.

Given that, the intersection of prefix and suffix maximums should be the position of the maximum element in the permutation.

That is, the last prefix maximum should be the first suffix maximum, which is the position of the maximum element.

This is already checked in the program.

Now, to count the number of permutations that have specific prefix and suffix maximum indices, I need to fix the values at these positions appropriately.

Specifically:

- The prefix maximums should have strictly increasing values.

- The suffix maximums should have strictly decreasing values.

- The intersection is the maximum value in the permutation.

Moreover, the values in between the prefix and suffix maximums need to be arranged such that they don't violate the prefix and suffix maximum conditions.

This seems quite involved.

Perhaps a better way is to consider that the values at the prefix maximum indices must be in increasing order, and the values at the suffix maximum indices must be in decreasing order.

Moreover, the maximum value is at the intersection of prefix and suffix maximum indices.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- P = set of prefix maximum indices.

- S = set of suffix maximum indices.

- M = maximum value in the permutation, which should be at the intersection of P and S.

Given that, we can fix M at the position P[-1] = S[0].

Then, the values in P before M should be increasing up to M.

Similarly, the values in S after M should be decreasing from M.

The remaining positions can be filled with the remaining numbers in any order that doesn't violate the prefix and suffix maximum conditions.

This seems complex.

Maybe inclusion-exclusion or dynamic programming can be used, but given the constraints (sum of n across all test cases up to 2e5), we need an efficient solution.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to be using combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of valid permutations.

However, without a clear explanation of the logic behind the combinatorial calculations, it's hard to verify its correctness.

Perhaps I should try to derive the solution myself.

Let’s consider that the prefix maximums are at positions p1 < p2 < ... < pm1, and suffix maximums are at positions s1 < s2 < ... < sm2.

Given that p[-1] = s[0] = position of the maximum value M.

Let’s denote pos_M = p[-1] = s[0].

Then, the values at p1, p2, ..., pos_M should be strictly increasing up to M.

Similarly, the values at pos_M, s1, s2, ..., sm2 should be strictly decreasing from M.

Wait, no.

Actually, since suffix maximums are in increasing order of indices, but the values should be decreasing as we move forward.

Wait, no.

Suffix maximums are positions where the value is greater than all values to the right.

So, for suffix maximums s1 < s2 < ... < sm2, the values at these positions should be greater than all to the right, but not necessarily decreasing.

Wait, actually, for suffix maximums, as we move from left to right, the values should be decreasing.

Because each suffix maximum is greater than all to the right, including the next suffix maximum.

So, in S, the values should be decreasing.

Similarly, for prefix maximums, the values should be increasing.

Given that, perhaps we can partition the permutation into segments defined by P and S and count the number of ways to arrange the numbers in these segments.

This sounds similar to dividing the permutation into blocks where certain positions have constraints, and the remaining positions can be arranged freely.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let’s consider building the permutation step by step.

First, the first prefix maximum is always at position 1, and it's the smallest value among the prefix maximums.

Then, each subsequent prefix maximum should have a larger value than the previous one.

Similarly, the last suffix maximum is at position n, and each previous suffix maximum should have a larger value than the ones to its right.

Given that, perhaps I can assign the values to the prefix and suffix maximum positions first and then arrange the remaining values in the remaining positions.

But there might be overlapping between P and S, which is only at pos_M.

I need to ensure that the values assigned to P are strictly increasing, and the values assigned to S are strictly decreasing.

Moreover, the value at pos_M should be the maximum value.

Let’s try to formalize this.

Let’s assign the values to P and S first.

Let’s sort the prefix maximum indices: p1 < p2 < ... < pm1, and assign values v1 < v2 < ... < vm1 to these positions.

Similarly, for suffix maximums s1 < s2 < ... < sm2, assign values w1 > w2 > ... > wm2 to these positions.

But s1 = pos_M = p[-1], and w1 = vm1 = M.

So, w1 = vm1 = M.

Now, the values assigned to P should be v1 < v2 < ... < vm1 = M.

The values assigned to S should be w1 = M > w2 > ... > wm2.

Note that S may include positions that are not in P, except for pos_M.

Similarly, P may include positions that are not in S, except for pos_M.

For the positions that are in both P and S, it's only pos_M.

Therefore, the values assigned to P and S are combined at pos_M with value M.

Now, the remaining positions can be filled with the remaining numbers, ensuring that they don't violate the prefix and suffix maximum conditions.

This seems complicated.

Maybe inclusion-exclusion isn't the way to go.

Perhaps I should look for a way to count the number of ways to assign values to P and S, and then multiply by the number of ways to arrange the remaining values.

But I need to ensure that the values in between don't invalidate the prefix and suffix maximums.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of choosing values for P and S first, and then arranging the remaining values in the remaining positions without violating the conditions.

Let’s try to break it down.

First, assign values to P and S.

Assign the smallest m1 values to P in increasing order.

Assign the largest m2 values to S in decreasing order, with the largest value at pos_M.

Wait, but there is an overlap at pos_M.

So, assign M to pos_M, which is both the largest in S and the largest in P.

Then, assign the next smallest m1-1 values to the remaining positions in P, and the next largest m2-1 values to the remaining positions in S.

Wait, no.

Actually, for P, we need v1 < v2 < ... < vm1 = M.

For S, we have w1 = M > w2 > ... > wm2.

So, we can choose m1-1 values for P excluding M, and m2-1 values for S excluding M.

But there might be overlapping positions, but in this problem, the only overlapping position is pos_M.

So, total distinct values to assign are m1 + m2 - 1 (since M is assigned to pos_M).

Wait, no.

P has m1 positions, S has m2 positions, but they share one position, pos_M.

So, total distinct positions are m1 + m2 - 1.

Therefore, we need to choose m1 + m2 - 1 distinct values from 1 to n, assign them to P and S in the required order, and then arrange the remaining n - (m1 + m2 - 1) values in the remaining positions.

But I need to make sure that the arrangement of remaining values doesn't violate the prefix and suffix maximum conditions.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I need to consider the segments defined by P and S and constrain the values accordingly.

Let’s consider dividing the permutation into segments delimited by P and S.

For example, between p[i] and p[i+1], or between s[j] and s[j+1], and so on.

But this seems complicated.

Maybe inclusion-exclusion or some other combinatorial identity can be applied here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the principle of multiplying the number of ways to arrange the values in different independent segments.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to be trying to compute something along these lines.

It calculates some combinatorial values and multiplies them together, taking into account factorials and modular inverses.

However, without a clear understanding of what these combinatorial values represent, it's hard to verify the correctness.

Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

I recall that in permutations with restricted positions, sometimes we can model the problem using dynamic programming or inclusion-exclusion principles.

But given the constraints, a pure dynamic programming approach might be too slow (O(n^2)).

Given that n can be up to 2e5, we need something more efficient, likely O(n) per test case or better.

Looking back at the program, it seems to iterate through the suffix and prefix maximum indices and calculate combinatorial values accordingly.

But I'm still not fully confident about its correctness.

Maybe I should consider a smaller example and see if the program produces the correct output.

Let’s take the second test case from the example:

n=4, m1=2, m2=3

p = [1,2]

s = [2,3,4]

According to the program:

- Check if p[-1] == s[0], p[0] ==1, s[-1] ==4. Yes.

- Initialize ans=1, kol=4

- Iterate through s:

- x=2: cnk = facts[3] / (facts[2] * facts[1]) = 6 / (2 * 1) = 3

- ans *=3

- kol = 4 - 2 =2

- x=3: cnk = facts[1] / (facts[1] * facts[0]) =1 / (1 *1) =1

- ans *=1

- kol =4 -3=1

- x=4: cnk = facts[0] / (facts[0] * facts[-1]) Wait, facts[-1] is invalid.

Wait, perhaps facts[0] is 1, and facts[-1] is not defined.

Hmm, maybe an off-by-one error.

Wait, in Python, negative indices wrap around, so facts[-1] is the last element.

But that doesn't make sense in this context.

This seems like a mistake in the program.

Moreover, in the next part:

kol = s[0] -1 =1

p2 = p[:-1] reversed, so p2=[1]

Then iterate through p2:

x=1: cnk = facts[0]/(facts[0]*facts[0])=1/(1*1)=1

ans *=1

Then, for i in range(m1-1):

ans *= facts[p[i+1]-p[i]-1] = facts[1-1-1]=facts[-1], which is invalid.

Wait, p[i+1]-p[i]-1 can be negative, which is invalid for factorials.

This suggests a mistake in the program.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these errors.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
