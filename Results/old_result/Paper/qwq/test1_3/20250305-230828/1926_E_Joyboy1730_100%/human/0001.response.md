Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n cards numbered from 1 to n, and he wants to lay them down in a specific order. The rules are a bit unusual. He first lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest, then all cards that are twice an odd number, again from smallest to largest, then three times an odd number, and so on, until all cards are laid down.

Okay, so for example, if n is 7, the order would be:

1. Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7

2. Twice odd numbers: 2 (which is 2*1), 6 (which is 2*3)

3. Three times odd numbers: nothing, since 3*1=3 (already in odds), 3*3=9 (which is greater than 7)

4. Four times odd numbers: 4 (which is 4*1)

So the order is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Now, the task is, given n and k, to find the k-th card in this ordering.

First, I need to understand the pattern here. It seems like we're grouping the numbers based on how many times an odd number is multiplied by a power of 2.

Wait, actually, it's multiplied by integers, not necessarily powers of 2. But looking at the steps:

- First, odd numbers: multiplied by 1.

- Then, twice odd numbers: multiplied by 2.

- Then, three times odd numbers: multiplied by 3.

- And so on.

But in the explanation, it seems like it's not exactly by multiples of odd numbers, but by the factor multiplied to an odd number.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of factoring each number into two parts: the largest power of 2 that divides the number, and the odd number that remains.

For example:

- 1: 1 * 1

- 2: 2 * 1

- 3: 1 * 3

- 4: 4 * 1

- 5: 1 * 5

- 6: 2 * 3

- 7: 1 * 7

Then, the ordering is first all numbers where the multiplier is 1 (the odd numbers), then multiplier is 2, then 3, and so on.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's specified as:

- First, all odd-numbered cards.

- Then, all cards that are twice an odd number.

- Then, all cards that are three times an odd number.

- And so on.

So, it's grouped by the multiplier to an odd number.

So, in the example with n=7:

- Multiplier 1: 1,3,5,7

- Multiplier 2: 2,6

- Multiplier 3: none (since 3*1=3 already in multiplier 1, 3*3=9>7)

- Multiplier 4: 4

- Multiplier 5: none

- And so on.

So, the groups are ordered by the multiplier, and within each group, ordered by the odd number multiplied.

Now, to find the k-th card, I need to iterate through these groups in order, keeping track of how many cards are in each group, and find out which group the k-th card falls into, and then which specific card it is.

First, I need to figure out, for a given n, what are the possible multipliers, and for each multiplier, how many cards belong to that group.

Let's think about how to determine, for a given multiplier m, how many cards are there that are equal to m times an odd number, and do not belong to any earlier group with a smaller multiplier.

Wait, but according to the problem, for each m, we consider all numbers that are m times an odd number, and these groups are considered in increasing order of m.

Moreover, once a card is laid down, it cannot be used again, so each card appears in exactly one group.

So, for a given n, I need to find, for each m starting from 1 upwards, the numbers that are m times an odd number, less than or equal to n.

For example, for n=7:

- m=1: 1*1=1, 1*3=3, 1*5=5, 1*7=7 → numbers 1,3,5,7

- m=2: 2*1=2, 2*3=6 → numbers 2,6

- m=3: 3*1=3 (but 3 is already in m=1), 3*3=9>7 → no new numbers

- m=4: 4*1=4 → number 4

- m=5: 5*1=5 (already in m=1), 5*3=15>7 → no new numbers

- m=6: 6*1=6 (already in m=2), 6*3=18>7 → no new numbers

- m=7: 7*1=7 (already in m=1), 7*3=21>7 → no new numbers

So, the groups are:

- m=1: 1,3,5,7

- m=2: 2,6

- m=4:4

Then, the ordering is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Now, to generalize this for any n and k, I need a way to efficiently determine, for each m, how many numbers are there that are m times an odd number, and haven't been placed in earlier groups.

But this seems a bit inefficient, especially since n can be up to 10^9 and t can be up to 5*10^4, so I need an O(1) or O(log n) per test case solution.

Let me think differently. Maybe there's a better way to index the k-th card without iterating through all possible m's.

Another way to look at it is to consider the multiplier m and the odd part o, where each number x can be expressed as x = m * o, where o is odd.

For example:

- 1 = 1*1

- 2 = 2*1

- 3 = 1*3

- 4 = 4*1

- 5 = 1*5

- 6 = 2*3

- 7 = 1*7

In the ordering, we first take all o where m=1, then m=2, and so on.

So, for a given m, the numbers in that group are m*o, where o is odd and m*o <= n.

Moreover, o must be such that o is not divisible by any smaller m's, but actually, since o is odd, it's already not divisible by any even m's, and for odd m's, it's handled by the ordering of m.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for m=3, o=1 is already in m=1, so we skip it.

So, for each m, the o's are the odd numbers that haven't been taken by smaller m's.

But this seems a bit messy to handle directly.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I can, for a given m, compute how many numbers are in that group.

Then, I can iterate through the m's, keeping a cumulative count of how many numbers have been placed so far, and check if k falls within the current group.

Once I find the group, I can then compute which specific number it is.

The challenge is to efficiently compute, for each m, how many numbers are in that group.

Given that n can be up to 10^9, and t up to 5*10^4, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula.

First, observe that for a given m, the numbers in that group are m times odd numbers, i.e., m*(2*i+1) for i=0,1,2,...

But we need to ensure that these numbers are <= n, and that they haven't been placed in earlier groups.

But according to the problem, the groups are ordered by m, and within each group, by o.

Also, since each x can be uniquely expressed as x = m * o, where o is the largest odd divisor of x.

Wait, that might be key.

Every positive integer x can be uniquely expressed as x = m * o, where o is the largest odd divisor of x.

Moreover, m is a power of 2 multiplied by some integer, but in this problem, m can be any positive integer, as long as o is odd.

Wait, no, m can be any positive integer, not necessarily a power of 2.

But in the problem, m is simply a positive integer multiplier.

So, for example, for x=12, o=3 (since 3 is the largest odd divisor), and m=4 (since 12=4*3).

But in this problem, the groups are ordered by m, not necessarily by the power of 2.

Wait, but in the problem, m can be any positive integer, not just a power of 2.

So, for m=1: o=1,3,5,7 (for n=7)

m=2: o=1,3 (since 2*1=2, 2*3=6)

m=3: o=None (since 3*1=3 already in m=1, 3*3=9>7)

m=4: o=1 (4*1=4)

And so on.

So, for a general m, the o's are the odd numbers such that m*o <=n, and o is not used in any smaller m's.

Wait, but in the problem, o is always odd, and for each m, we take o as odd, and m*o <=n.

But o is unique for each x, as the largest odd divisor.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the highest power of 2 dividing m.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try to find a better way.

An alternative approach is to iterate through m starting from 1 upwards, compute how many o's are there such that m*o <=n and o is odd, and o has not been used in any smaller m's.

But keeping track of which o's have been used in smaller m's seems inefficient.

Is there a smarter way?

Let me consider that for each m, the number of o's such that m*o <=n and o is odd is floor(n/m)/2, if m is odd, or (floor(n/m)+1)/2 if m is even.

Wait, no.

Wait, for m=1, o can be 1,3,5,7 for n=7.

For m=2, o can be 1,3.

For m=4, o can be 1.

So, for a given m, the number of o's is floor(n/(2*m)), since o is odd, i.e., the number of odd integers o where o <= floor(n/m).

The number of odd integers up to k is ceil(k/2).

So, for each m, the number of o's is ceil(floor(n/m)/2).

Wait, more precisely, floor(floor(n/m)/2 + 0.5), but in integer terms, it's floor(n/(2*m)) if m divides n, else floor(n/(2*m)) or floor((n/m)+1)/2.

This seems a bit messy.

Is there a better way?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I can iterate through m from 1 to n, compute the number of o's for each m, accumulate the counts, and find where k falls.

But with n up to 1e9, I can't iterate through all m's.

I need a way to find the m for which the k-th card lies.

Wait, perhaps I can find the largest m such that the cumulative count up to m-1 is less than k.

Then, within that m, find the specific o.

But finding the largest m requires knowing the count for each m, which seems slow for large n.

Wait, perhaps I can think of m as divisors.

Wait, no, m is not necessarily a divisor of n.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the multiplicative structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through m in a way that allows me to compute the cumulative counts efficiently.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to attempt something similar.

Let me analyze the given code.

The code reads t, the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and k.

Then, it initializes an empty list L.

Then, it enters a loop where it sets m = (n + 1) // 2, subtracts m from n, and appends m to L.

It repeats this until n becomes 0.

Then, it initializes tot=0 and pow=1.

Then, it iterates through the list L, and for each a in L, checks if tot < k <= tot + a, and if so, prints pow * (2*(k - tot) -1), then breaks.

Otherwise, it adds a to tot and multiplies pow by 2.

So, what's happening here?

First, it seems to be building a list L that represents the number of cards in each group corresponding to m=1, m=2, m=4, etc.

Wait, but why m=1, m=2, m=4, etc.?

Wait, in the code, m is set to (n + 1) // 2, then n is updated to n - m, and m is appended to L.

So, for n=7:

- m = (7 + 1)//2 = 4, n = 7 - 4 = 3, L=[4]

- m = (3 + 1)//2 = 2, n = 3 - 2 =1, L=[4,2]

- m = (1 + 1)//2 =1, n=1-1=0, L=[4,2,1]

Then, tot=0, pow=1

First a=4, tot <k <=tot+4, i.e., 0<k<=4

If k is 1,2,3,4, it prints 1*(2*(k-0)-1) = 1,3,5,7

Then tot=4, pow=2

Next a=2, tot=4 <k <=6

If k=5,6, prints 2*(2*(k-4)-1)=2*(2*1-1)=2, or 2*(2*2-1)=6

Then tot=6, pow=4

Next a=1, tot=6 <k<=7

If k=7, prints 4*(2*(7-6)-1)=4*(2*1 -1)=4

Which matches the order 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

So, it seems to be working correctly for n=7.

How does this generalization work?

Let's see for n=1:

- m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[1]

- tot=0, pow=1

- a=1, 0<k<=1, prints 1*(2*(k-0)-1)=1

Which is correct.

For n=34, k=14:

- m=(34+1)//2=17, n=34-17=17, L=[17]

- m=(17+1)//2=9, n=17-9=8, L=[17,9]

- m=(8+1)//2=4, n=8-4=4, L=[17,9,4]

- m=(4+1)//2=2, n=4-2=2, L=[17,9,4,2]

- m=(2+1)//2=1, n=2-1=1, L=[17,9,4,2,1]

- m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[17,9,4,2,1,1]

Then, tot=0, pow=1

- a=17, if 0<k<=17, prints 1*(2*(k-0)-1)

- But k=14<=17, so prints 1*(2*14 -1)=27

Which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for n=84, k=19:

- m=(84+1)//2=42, n=84-42=42, L=[42]

- m=(42+1)//2=21, n=42-21=21, L=[42,21]

- m=(21+1)//2=11, n=21-11=10, L=[42,21,11]

- m=(10+1)//2=5, n=10-5=5, L=[42,21,11,5]

- m=(5+1)//2=3, n=5-3=2, L=[42,21,11,5,3]

- m=(2+1)//2=1, n=2-1=1, L=[42,21,11,5,3,1]

- m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[42,21,11,5,3,1,1]

Then, tot=0, pow=1

- a=42, if 0<k<=42, which includes k=19, prints 1*(2*19 -1)=37

Which matches the sample output.

Lastly, for n=1000000000, k=1000000000:

- m=(1000000000+1)//2=500000000, n=1000000000-500000000=500000000, L=[500000000]

- m=(500000000+1)//2=250000000, n=500000000-250000000=250000000, L=[500000000,250000000]
