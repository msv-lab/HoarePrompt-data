Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n cards numbered from 1 to n, and he wants to lay them down in a specific order. The rules are a bit unusual. He first lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest, then all cards that are twice an odd number, again from smallest to largest, then three times an odd number, and so on, until all cards are laid down.

Okay, so for example, if n is 7, the order would be:

1. Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7

2. Twice odd numbers: 2 (which is 2*1), 6 (which is 2*3)

3. Three times odd numbers: nothing, because 3*1=3 is already in the odd numbers, and 3*3=9 is greater than 7

4. Four times odd numbers: 4 (which is 4*1)

So the order is 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.

Now, the task is, given n and k, to find out what the k-th card laid down is.

First, I need to understand the pattern here. It seems like the cards are being grouped by their highest odd divisor. Wait, what's that?

Let me think. Every number can be expressed as a product of a power of 2 and an odd number. For example:

- 1 = 1 * 2^0

- 2 = 1 * 2^1

- 3 = 3 * 2^0

- 4 = 1 * 2^2

- 5 = 5 * 2^0

- 6 = 3 * 2^1

- 7 = 7 * 2^0

- 8 = 1 * 2^3

And so on.

So, the process is to first lay down all numbers where the power of 2 is 0 (the odd numbers), then where the power of 2 is 1, then power of 2 is 2, and so on.

Wait, but in the example, twice odd numbers come after odd numbers, which matches power of 2 being 1, then power of 2 being 2, etc.

So, essentially, the cards are being grouped by the exponent of 2 in their factorization, starting from exponent 0 (odd numbers) to higher exponents.

So, the order is:

1. Numbers with 2^0 (odd numbers)

2. Numbers with 2^1

3. Numbers with 2^2

4. And so on.

Within each group, they are ordered by their odd divisor, multiplied by 2^exponent.

Wait, in the example, for exponent 1: 2 (which is 1*2), 6 (which is 3*2)

For exponent 2: 4 (which is 1*4)

So, within each group, they are ordered by their odd divisor.

So, to generalize, the ordering is by increasing exponent of 2, and within each exponent, by increasing odd divisor.

But in the problem statement, it's described differently, but it seems equivalent.

So, to find the k-th card, I need to iterate through these groups in order, count how many cards are in each group, and find out which group the k-th card belongs to, and then which specific card it is.

First, I need to figure out how many groups there are. Since n can be up to 1e9 and t is up to 5e4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let's see, for a given n, what's the maximum exponent of 2 that can appear in the factorization of any number up to n? It's floor(log2(n)).

For example, for n=7, log2(7) is about 2.8, so maximum exponent is 2.

For n=8, log2(8)=3.

So, the number of groups is floor(log2(n)) + 1.

Wait, but in the example with n=7, we have exponents 0,1,2, which is 3 groups, and floor(log2(7))=2, plus 1 is 3, so yes.

Now, for each group, how many cards are there?

In group with exponent t, the numbers are of the form (2^t) * (some odd number).

The number of such numbers up to n is floor(n / (2^t)).

But, we have to make sure that the odd number part is odd and hasn't been counted in previous groups.

Wait, no, actually, since each number has a unique exponent of 2 and a unique odd divisor, we can simply calculate for each t, the number of numbers up to n that are divisible by 2^t but not by 2^(t+1).

Wait, no, in this problem, we're grouping by the exponent t, so for each t, the number of numbers up to n that are divisible by 2^t but not by 2^(t+1).

But in the problem, it's described as laying down all cards that are m times an odd number, where m starts from 1 upwards.

Wait, but in the example, for m=1 (odd numbers), m=2, m=4, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of m being powers of 2.

So, m=1 (2^0), m=2 (2^1), m=4 (2^2), etc.

And for each m, we lay down numbers that are m times an odd number, in increasing order.

So, for m=1: 1,3,5,7

For m=2: 2,6

For m=4:4

For m=8: none, since 8>7

And so on.

So, for each m=2^t, the numbers in that group are m times any odd number, up to n.

So, for each m=2^t, the count of numbers in that group is floor((n)/(m)) - floor((n)/(2*m))

Wait, why?

Because floor(n/m) gives the number of odd multiples up to n/m, since m is a power of 2.

Wait, actually, floor(n/m) gives the number of integers up to n that are multiples of m.

But since m is a power of 2, and we're multiplying by odd numbers, the number of odd multiples up to floor(n/m).

Wait, perhaps it's simpler.

Given m=2^t, the numbers in the group are m*1, m*3, m*5, etc., up to the largest odd k where m*k <=n.

So, the count is the number of odd integers k such that m*k <=n.

Which is floor(n/m)/2, rounded up.

Wait, no.

Actually, the number of odd integers up to some number x is ceil(x/2).

Wait, more precisely, the number of odd positive integers up to x is floor((x+1)/2).

So, for m=2^t, the count of numbers in the group is floor((floor(n/m)+1)/2).

Wait, let's think differently.

Given m=2^t, the numbers in the group are m*1, m*3, m*5, ..., up to the largest odd k where m*k <=n.

So, k <= floor(n/m), and k is odd.

The number of odd integers up to floor(n/m) is floor((floor(n/m)+1)/2).

So, the count for group m=2^t is floor((floor(n/m)+1)/2).

So, in code, for each t from 0 upwards, calculate m=2^t, then count = floor((floor(n/m)+1)/2)

Then, iterate through t, accumulating the counts, until the accumulated count reaches or exceeds k.

Then, in the group where the accumulated count reaches k, calculate which specific number it is.

Wait, but in the provided program, it seems to be doing something different.

Let's look at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

L = []

while n:

m = (n + 1) // 2

n -= m

L.append(m)

tot = 0

pow = 1

for a in L:

if tot < k <= tot + a:

print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))

tot += a

pow *= 2

So, it reads t, the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and k.

Then, it initializes an empty list L.

Then, there's a loop: while n:

m = (n + 1) // 2

n -= m

L.append(m)

So, it's building a list L where each element is m=(n+1)//2, then subtracting m from n, and repeating until n becomes 0.

Then, it initializes tot=0 and pow=1.

Then, iterates through the list L:

for a in L:

if tot < k <= tot + a:

print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))

tot += a

pow *= 2

So, it's accumulating tot, and for each a in L, it checks if k is in the range (tot, tot+a], and if so, prints pow*(2*(k-tot)-1), then breaks or continues? Wait, it doesn't break, it continues, but since it's inside the loop, perhaps it's intended to process each group sequentially.

Wait, but in the code, it seems to be trying to find which group k falls into, and then compute the corresponding card number.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First, let's see what L represents.

In the while loop:

while n:

m = (n + 1) // 2

n -= m

L.append(m)

So, starting with n, m=(n+1)//2, then n -= m, and repeat.

For example, take n=7.

First iteration: n=7, m=(7+1)//2=4, n=7-4=3, L=[4]

Second iteration: n=3, m=(3+1)//2=2, n=3-2=1, L=[4,2]

Third iteration: n=1, m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[4,2,1]

Then, tot=0, pow=1

First a=4:

if 0 < k <=4

- for k=1: print(1*(2*(1-0)-1)=1)

- for k=2: print(1*(2*(2-0)-1)=3)

- for k=3: print(1*(2*(3-0)-1)=5)

- for k=4: print(1*(2*(4-0)-1)=7)

Then, tot=4, pow=2

Second a=2:

if 4 < k <=6

- for k=5: print(2*(2*(5-4)-1)=2)

- for k=6: print(2*(2*(6-4)-1)=6)

Then, tot=6, pow=4

Third a=1:

if 6 < k <=7

- for k=7: print(4*(2*(7-6)-1)=4)

Which matches the example order: 1,3,5,7,2,6,4

So, it seems to work for n=7.

Let's see for n=1:

L=[]

First, n=1, m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[1]

Then, tot=0, pow=1

First a=1:

if 0 < k <=1:

print(1*(2*(1-0)-1)=1)

Which is correct.

Another example: n=34, k=14

Let's see what L is:

n=34, m=(34+1)//2=17, n=34-17=17, L=[17]

n=17, m=(17+1)//2=9, n=17-9=8, L=[17,9]

n=8, m=(8+1)//2=4, n=8-4=4, L=[17,9,4]

n=4, m=(4+1)//2=2, n=4-2=2, L=[17,9,4,2]

n=2, m=(2+1)//2=1, n=2-1=1, L=[17,9,4,2,1]

n=1, m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[17,9,4,2,1,1]

Now, tot=0, pow=1

First a=17:

if 0 < k <=17: for k=14, print(1*(2*(14-0)-1)=27)

But according to the example, n=34, k=14, output=27.

Wait, is that correct?

Let's see:

n=34

Odd numbers (m=1): 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33

Twice odd numbers (m=2): 2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34

Four times odd numbers (m=4):4,12,20,28,36 (but 36>34, so 4,12,20,28)

Eight times odd numbers (m=8):8,24,40 (40>34, so 8,24)

Sixteen times odd numbers (m=16):16,48 (48>34, so 16)

Thirty-two times odd numbers (m=32):32

So, the order is:

1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34,4,12,20,28,8,24,16,32

So, positions 1 to 17: odds 1 to 33

Position 14 is 27, which matches the example output.

So, the code seems to be correct for this case.

Another example: n=84, k=19

Let's build L:

n=84, m=(84+1)//2=42, n=84-42=42, L=[42]

n=42, m=(42+1)//2=21, n=42-21=21, L=[42,21]

n=21, m=(21+1)//2=11, n=21-11=10, L=[42,21,11]

n=10, m=(10+1)//2=5, n=10-5=5, L=[42,21,11,5]

n=5, m=(5+1)//2=3, n=5-3=2, L=[42,21,11,5,3]

n=2, m=(2+1)//2=1, n=2-1=1, L=[42,21,11,5,3,1]

n=1, m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[42,21,11,5,3,1,1]

Now, tot=0, pow=1

First a=42:

if 0 < k <=42: for k=19, print(1*(2*(19-0)-1)=37)

According to the example, n=84, k=19, output=37.

Let's verify:

Odds: 1,3,5,...,83 (42 numbers)

Twice odds: 2,6,10,...,82 (21 numbers)

Four times odds:4,12,20,...,84 (11 numbers)

Eight times odds:8,24,40,56,72,88 (but 88>84, so 8,24,40,56,72)

Sixteen times odds:16,48,80

Thirty-two times odds:32,96 (96>84, so only 32)

Sixty-four times odds:64

So, the order is:

Odds: positions 1-42

Twice odds: positions 43-63

Four times odds: positions 64-74

Eight times odds: positions 75-80

Sixteen times odds: positions 81-83

Thirty-two times odds: position 84

Sixty-four times odds: none, since 64 is already included in previous groups.

So, k=19 is within the first 42, which are odds, so it should be the 19th odd number, which is 1 + 2*(19-1) = 37, which matches the output.

So, again, the code seems correct.

One more example: n=1000000000, k=1000000000

According to the code:

L would be built as:

n=1000000000

m=(1000000000+1)//2=500000000, n=1000000000-500000000=500000000, L=[500000000]

n=500000000, m=(500000000+1)//2=250000000, n=500000000-250000000=250000000, L=[500000000,250000000]

n=3, m=(3+1)//2=2, n=3-2=1, L=[... ,2,1]

n=1, m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[... ,1]

So, L is a list of m values, where m=(n+1)//2, n -= m, repeated until n=0.

Now, tot=0, pow=1

Fifteenth a=30518:

999938965 <1000000000 <=999938965+30518: 999938965 <1000000000 <=999969483: no

Sixteenth a=30517:

999969483 <1000000000 <=999969483+30517: 999969483 <1000000000 <=999999999: yes

So, k=1000000000 is in this group.

So, print(pow * (2*(k - tot)-1)) = 32768 * (2*(1000000000 - 999969483)-1) = 32768 * (2*30517-1) = 32768 * (61034 -1) = 32768 * 61033 = 2000000000 + some more, but according to the example, it's 536870912.

Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, according to the example, n=1000000000, k=1000000000, output=536870912.

But according to my calculation, it should be 32768 * (2*(1000000000 -999969483)-1) = 32768 * (2*30517 -1) = 32768 * 61033 = 2,000,000,000 + something, which is way above n=1000000000.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, in the code, it's:

print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) -1))

But in this case, k - tot =1000000000 -999969483=30517

So, 2*30517 -1=61033

Then, pow=32768

So, 32768 *61033=2,000,000,000 +, which is greater than n=1000000000, but according to the example, it's 536870912, which is 2^29.

Wait, perhaps I missed something in understanding the groups.

Wait, maybe the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the way L is built is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps L represents the number of elements in each group, where each group corresponds to a different power of 2.

Wait, in the code, L seems to be built by repeatedly taking m=(n+1)//2 and subtracting m from n, until n=0.

This seems similar to the steps of dividing n into groups where each group has m elements, and then updating n to n - m.

But is m correctly representing the count of elements in each group?

Wait, perhaps m=(n+1)//2 is the count of odd numbers in n, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, for n=7:

L=[4,2,1]

Which corresponds to:

- m=4 (odd numbers: 1,3,5,7)

- m=2 (twice odd numbers:2,6)

- m=1 (four times odd number:4)

Which matches the example.

Similarly, for n=1, L=[1], which is correct.

For n=34, L=[17,9,4,2,1,1]

Which corresponds to:

- m=17 (odd numbers:1,3,5,...,33)

- m=9 (twice odd numbers:2,6,10,...,34)

- m=4 (four times odd numbers:4,12,20,28)

- m=2 (eight times odd numbers:8,24)

- m=1 (sixteen times odd number:16)

- m=1 (thirty-two times odd number:32)

Which seems correct.

So, L seems to correctly represent the count of numbers in each group, ordered by increasing power of 2.

Then, in the code, tot accumulates the counts, and pow=2^t, where t is the group index.

Then, for the group where tot < k <= tot + a, the k-th card is pow * (2*(k - tot) -1)

Wait, but in the n=1000000000, k=1000000000 case, according to the example, it's 536870912, but according to my calculation, it's 32768 *61033=2,000,000,000 +, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the group.

Wait, perhaps a=30517 is not the correct group.

Wait, perhaps there are more elements in L.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I stopped at a=30517, but perhaps there are more steps.

Wait, no, in my earlier calculation, after a=30517, tot=999969483, and k=1000000000 is within the next a=30517, but 30517*32768*2 exceeds n.

Wait, perhaps the formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be pow * (2*(k - tot) -1), but constrained by n.

Wait, but in the example, n=1000000000, k=1000000000, output=536870912, which is 2^29.

Wait, 2^29=536870912.

So, perhaps it's the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n.

But according to the code, it's pow * (2*(k - tot)-1), which in this case is 32768*61033=2,000,000,000+, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be pow * (2*(k - tot) -1), but k - tot is the position within the group, and it should be mapped to the corresponding number.

Wait, in the group with pow=2^t, the numbers are 2^t * (1,3,5,...)

So, the k-th number in this group is 2^t * (2*(k - tot) -1)

But in the case where k=1000000000, and tot=999969483, a=30517, so position within the group is k - tot=30517.

So, the number should be pow * (2*30517 -1)=32768*(61034-1)=32768*61033=2,000,000,000+, which is invalid since n=1000000000.

But according to the example, it's 536870912, which is 2^29.

Wait, perhaps in the last group, the numbers are just powers of 2, up to n.

Wait, but according to the grouping, each group corresponds to a different power of 2.

Wait, perhaps in the last group, a=1, which corresponds to pow=2^t, and the only number in that group is pow.

Wait, but in the example, a=30517, which is greater than 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the actual group corresponding to a=30517.

Wait, perhaps I need to see what m corresponds to a=30517.

Wait, in the L list, a=30517 is the sixteenth element.

Wait, but in the earlier steps, a=30517 is added when n=30517.

Wait, perhaps I need to see what pow corresponds to a=30517.

Wait, in the code, pow is multiplied by
