Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp has a string made of lowercase Latin letters, and he encodes it using a specific algorithm. The encoding involves creating an auxiliary string 'r' which consists of all distinct letters from the original string 's', sorted alphabetically. Then, each character in 's' is replaced by its symmetric character from 'r'. For example, the first character of 'r' is replaced by the last of 'r', the second by the second last, and so on.

Given the encoded string, I need to decode it back to the original string 's'. There are multiple test cases, and I have to handle each one accordingly.

First, I need to understand the encoding process thoroughly to reverse it correctly. Let's break it down:

1. **Create the auxiliary string 'r':**

- 'r' contains all unique characters from 's', sorted alphabetically.

2. **Encoding process:**

- Each character in 's' is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in 'r'.

- For example, if 'r' is "ace", then 'a' is replaced by 'e', 'c' remains 'c', and 'e' is replaced by 'a'.

So, to decode, I need to reverse this process. Given the encoded string, I need to reconstruct 'r' and then map each character back to its original counterpart in 'r'.

Wait a minute, the problem mentions that the encoding is done by replacing each character in 's' with its symmetric character from 'r'. So, to decode, I need to apply the same replacement again because swapping twice brings me back to the original.

Let me think about that. If I have 's' = "codeforces", then 'r' = "cdefors", and the encoding is "serofedsoc". Now, if I take "serofedsoc" and apply the same encoding process again, I should get back to "codeforces".

So, perhaps the decoding is just applying the encoding process again. But I need to confirm this logic.

Let me try with a small example.

Take 's' = "abc"

Then 'r' = "abc"

Encoding:

- 'a' is replaced by 'c'

- 'b' remains 'b'

- 'c' is replaced by 'a'

So, encoded string is "cba"

Now, if I apply the encoding again:

- 'c' is replaced by 'a'

- 'b' remains 'b'

- 'a' is replaced by 'c'

So, I get back "abc", which is the original string.

Another example:

's' = "aab"

'r' = "ab"

Encoding:

- 'a' is replaced by 'b'

- 'a' is replaced by 'b'

- 'b' is replaced by 'a'

So, encoded string is "bba"

Now, apply encoding again:

- 'b' is replaced by 'a'

- 'b' is replaced by 'a'

- 'a' is replaced by 'b'

So, I get "aab", which is the original string.

Seems consistent. So, decoding is just applying the encoding process again.

Therefore, in the program, for each test case, I need to take the encoded string 'b', and apply the encoding process again to get back the original string 's'.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```python

if __name__ == '__main__':

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        b = input()

        encoded_str = func_1(b)

        print(encoded_str)

def func_1(s):

    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))

    (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)

    for char in s:

        if char in unique_chars:

            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])

            j -= 1

        else:

            unique_chars.insert(i, char)

            i += 1

            j += 1

    return ''.join(unique_chars)

```

Wait, this doesn't seem right. The function `func_1` is trying to do something, but it's not clear what it's doing, and it's not matching the encoding process I understood.

Let me analyze `func_1` step by step.

1. It takes a string `s` (which is the encoded string 'b').

2. It creates `unique_chars` as a sorted list of unique characters in 's'.

3. It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` at the start and end of `unique_chars`.

4. It iterates through each character in 's':

- If the character is in `unique_chars`, it replaces all occurrences of that character in 's' with `unique_chars[j]` and decrements `j`.

- If the character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts that character at position `i` in `unique_chars`, increments `i` and `j`.

Finally, it returns the joined `unique_chars`.

This seems completely off. The goal is to decode 'b' to get back 's', but this function is modifying 's' by replacing characters in a loop, and then returning the modified `unique_chars`, which is a list of characters, potentially with duplicates and insertions.

This doesn't align with the encoding process described in the problem. The encoding process is about replacing each character based on its position in the sorted unique characters list, not about iteratively replacing characters and modifying the unique characters list.

I think there's a mistake in the `func_1` implementation. Let me try to come up with the correct approach.

Correct Approach:

1. For each test case:

a. Read 'n' and the encoded string 'b'.

b. Create the auxiliary string 'r' from 'b':

- Collect all unique characters from 'b', sorted alphabetically.

c. Create a mapping from each character in 'r' to its symmetric character in 'r'.

d. Replace each character in 'b' with its corresponding character from the mapping to get back the original string 's'.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, since encoding is a symmetric process, applying encoding again should give back the original string. So, perhaps I can just apply the encoding process again on 'b' to get 's'.

Let me confirm this with an example.

Take 's' = "codeforces", 'r' = "cdefors", encoded 'b' = "serofedsoc".

Now, to decode "serofedsoc" back to "codeforces", I need to:

- Create 'r' from 'b': sorted unique characters of 'b', which is "cdefors".

- Create the mapping:

- 'c' -> 's'

- 'd' -> 'r'

- 'e' -> 'o'

- 'f' -> 'f'

- 'o' -> 'e'

- 'r' -> 'd'

- 's' -> 'c'

- Apply this mapping to each character in 'b':

- 's' -> 'c'

- 'e' -> 'o'

- 'r' -> 'd'

- 'o' -> 'e'

- 'f' -> 'f'

- 'e' -> 'o'

- 'd' -> 'r'

- 's' -> 'c'

- 'o' -> 'e'

- 'c' -> 's'

Which gives "codeforces", matching the original 's'.

So, yes, decoding is applying the same encoding process again.

Therefore, in code, for each test case:

- Read 'n' and 'b'.

- Get the sorted unique characters of 'b' to form 'r'.

- Create a mapping where each character in 'r' is mapped to its symmetric character in 'r'.

- Replace each character in 'b' with its mapped character to get 's'.

- Print 's'.

Now, looking back at the provided `func_1`, it doesn't do this. It seems to be trying to create some mapping, but it's not correct.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
