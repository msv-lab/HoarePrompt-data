Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, a positive integer m, and a string of commands consisting of 'L's and 'R's. For each command, I need to output the product of the current array modulo m, and then remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have to process n commands, where n is the length of the array and the string s. Each command corresponds to removing either the first or the last element of the array, and before removing, I have to calculate the product of the current array elements modulo m and output it.

I need to make sure that I handle the modulo operation correctly, especially since the product of the array elements could be very large, given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and each a_i can be up to 10^4. So, directly computing the product and then taking modulo m won't work because the product would be too large to handle. I need a smarter way to compute the product modulo m efficiently.

Let me think about how to compute the product modulo m efficiently. One way is to keep track of the product as I remove elements from the array. If I can maintain the current product modulo m as I remove elements, that would be efficient.

Wait, but the removals are specified by the string s, which can be a mix of 'L's and 'R's. So, I need to simulate the process of removing elements from either end and updating the product accordingly.

This seems a bit tricky because removing elements from the ends and keeping track of the product dynamically isn't straightforward, especially since multiplication and modulo operations need to be handled carefully.

Let me consider the constraints again. The sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, which means I need an O(n) solution per test case.

I need to find a way to compute the product modulo m for each step efficiently.

Let me consider the order of operations. In each step, I need to:

1. Output the product of the current array modulo m.

2. Remove an element from either end based on the command.

I need to do this for n steps, and n can be up to 2*10^5, so I need an efficient way to compute the product modulo m at each step without recomputing it from scratch.

One idea is to compute the product of the entire array modulo m initially, then, based on the command, divide the product by the element being removed and take modulo m again.

Wait, but division under modulo is not straightforward, especially since m could be any positive integer up to 10^4. I need to be careful with division under modulo.

I recall that to divide by a number under modulo, I need to multiply by the modular inverse of that number. So, if I need to compute (product / a_i) mod m, I need to compute (product * inv(a_i)) mod m, where inv(a_i) is the modular inverse of a_i modulo m.

But, modular inverses exist only if a_i and m are coprime, i.e., gcd(a_i, m) = 1. If a_i and m are not coprime, then a_i doesn't have an inverse modulo m.

Hmm, that's a problem because a_i can be any integer from 1 to 10^4, and m can be up to 10^4 as well. So, it's possible that a_i and m are not coprime, meaning a_i might not have an inverse modulo m.

So, maybe this approach isn't suitable.

Let me think of another way.

Another idea is to precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m.

Let me explain:

- Compute prefix products: prefix[i] = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i] mod m

- Compute suffix products: suffix[i] = a[i] * a[i+1] * ... * a[n-1] mod m

Then, at each step, depending on the command, I can determine which part of the array is still present and compute the product accordingly.

Wait, but since the commands are a mix of 'L's and 'R's, it's not straightforward to keep track of which prefix or suffix is still present.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider simulating the process.

I can maintain a deque or a double-ended queue to represent the array, since I need to remove elements from either end efficiently.

Then, for each command, I can:

1. Compute the product of all elements in the deque modulo m.

2. Remove the element from the left or right based on the command.

But computing the product of all elements in the deque at each step would be too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a faster way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements, and then divide by the removed elements accordingly.

But again, division under modulo is tricky due to the existence of inverses.

Let me consider another angle.

What if I keep track of the product modulo m, and also keep track of the elements that have been removed.

Then, I can adjust the product accordingly by dividing by the removed elements, but only if they have inverses.

But as I thought earlier, some elements might not have inverses modulo m, so this approach might not work.

Wait, maybe I can compute the product modulo m, and keep track of the removed elements in a separate list.

Then, for each step, I can compute the product of the remaining elements by dividing the full product by the product of removed elements.

But again, division under modulo requires inverses, which may not exist.

This seems like a dead end.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I process the commands in reverse order.

That is, start from the end, and instead of removing elements, I add them back to the array.

This way, I can maintain the product modulo m as I add elements back, and then reverse the order to get the desired output.

Let's see.

If I start from the last command and work backwards, I can build the array step by step, and at each step, add the element I removed earlier back into the array, and update the product accordingly.

Then, the product at each step would correspond to the product just before that step was executed in the original sequence.

Wait, this might be confusing.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let's say I have the final array after all commands have been executed, which is empty.

Then, working backwards, at each step, I add back the element that was removed in that step, either to the left or to the right of the array.

At the same time, I can maintain the product of the current array modulo m.

Then, the product before adding that element would be the product after removing it in the original sequence.

Wait, this seems promising.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 4, m = 6

a = [3, 1, 4, 2]

s = "LRRL"

Let's reverse the string s to "LRRL" and try to build the array step by step.

Start with an empty array.

Step 1 (original step 4): add 'L' -> add 10 to the left (but in this example, it's the last command 'L', which corresponds to adding back the last removed element.

Wait, I need to be careful.

In the original sequence:

1. Command 'L': remove 3, product of [1,4,2] is 8 mod 6 = 2

2. Command 'R': remove 2, product of [1,4] is 4 mod 6 = 4

3. Command 'R': remove 4, product of [1] is 1 mod 6 = 1

4. Command 'L': remove 1, empty array.

So, reversing, starting from empty array:

1. Add 1 to the left (since original last command is 'L'), array = [1]

2. Add 4 to the right (original third command is 'R'), array = [1,4]

3. Add 2 to the right (original second command is 'R'), array = [1,4,2]

4. Add 3 to the left (original first command is 'L'), array = [3,1,4,2]

At each step, I can compute the product of the current array modulo m.

So, in reverse order:

- Step 1: array = [1], product = 1 mod 6 = 1

- Step 2: array = [1,4], product = 4 mod 6 = 4

- Step 3: array = [1,4,2], product = 8 mod 6 = 2

- Step 4: array = [3,1,4,2], product = 24 mod 6 = 0

Now, reversing these products back, we get 0,2,4,1, which matches the first line of the sample output.

Interesting! So, this approach seems to work.

Let me generalize this.

I can reverse the string s and keep adding elements to either left or right based on the reversed commands, while maintaining the product modulo m.

Then, the products computed at each step, when reversed, give the desired output.

This seems efficient because adding elements to either end can be done in O(1) time using a deque, and updating the product is O(1) per step.

Given that n is up to 2*10^5, this should be efficient enough.

Now, let's see how to implement this.

I'll need to:

1. Read t test cases.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n and m.

b. Read the array a.

c. Read the string s.

d. Reverse s.

e. Initialize a deque.

f. Initialize the product p = 1.

g. For each command in the reversed s:

i. Depending on the command, add the corresponding element to the deque.

ii. Update the product p by multiplying with the added element and taking modulo m.

iii. Append p to a list.

h. Reverse the list of products to get the desired order.

i. Print the products separated by spaces.

Wait, but in the sample input, the output is on separate lines for each test case, with the products separated by spaces.

So, I need to collect the products in a list, reverse it, and then print the space-separated values.

This seems straightforward.

Let me consider edge cases.

Edge Case 1: n = 1

- a = [10000]

- s = "R"

- m = 10000

- Output: 0

Because 10000 mod 10000 = 0

Edge Case 2: n = 5, m = 1

- a = [1,1,1,1,1]

- s = "LLLLL"

- Product modulo 1 is always 0, since any number modulo 1 is 0.

Edge Case 3: n = 6, m = 8

- a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

- s = "RLLLRR"

- Need to simulate the commands and compute products accordingly.

I need to make sure that my approach handles these cases correctly.

Another thing to consider is that m can be 1, in which case any product modulo m is 0.

Also, a_i can be 1, which doesn't change the product, or a_i can be m, which makes its contribution 0 to the product.

I need to handle these cases properly.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

I'll use a deque to simulate the array, and a list to collect the products.

I'll reverse the string s, and for each command in the reversed s:

- If the command is 'L', it means in the original sequence, it was removing the leftmost element. So, in the reversed sequence, I add it to the left.

- If the command is 'R', it means in the original sequence, it was removing the rightmost element. So, in the reversed sequence, I add it to the right.

Wait, actually, I need to be careful with the interpretation.

Wait, no.

In the reversed sequence:

- If the original command was 'L' (remove left), then in the reversed sequence, I should add it to the left.

- If the original command was 'R' (remove right), then in the reversed sequence, I should add it to the right.

Because adding in the reversed sequence corresponds to undoing the removal in the original sequence.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, I can proceed with that.

Let me outline the steps again:

- Read t.

- For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read array a.

- Read string s.

- Reverse s.

- Initialize an empty deque.

- Initialize p = 1.

- Initialize an empty list to store products.

- For each command in the reversed s:

- If command is 'L', add a new element to the left of the deque.

- If command is 'R', add a new element to the right of the deque.

- Update p = (p * added_element) % m

- Append p to the list.

- After processing all commands, reverse the list of products and print them.

Wait, but in the sample input, the output seems to have a space at the end.

Not necessarily, in the sample input, it's "0 2 4 1 ", but it might just be a formatting issue.

I need to make sure that there's no trailing space at the end.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases correctly, ensuring that each test case's output is on a separate line.

Now, let's think about implementing this in code.

I need to read t, then for each test case, read n and m, read the array a, read the string s, process it as described, and output the products for that test case.

I need to make sure that I handle the input correctly, especially since there are multiple test cases and the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, so I need to read the input efficiently.

In Python, reading input using sys.stdin.read() and splitting it into tokens can be efficient for such constraints.

Let me think about how to structure the code.

I can read all input at once, split it into tokens, and process them accordingly.

I'll need to keep track of the current position in the list of tokens.

For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read the next n integers as the array a.

- Read the next string s, which should have length n.

- Process as described.

I need to make sure that I read the string s correctly, as it can contain only 'L's and 'R's.

Also, I need to reverse s, process it as described, compute the products, reverse the list of products, and print them.

Let me try to write a sample code snippet to see.

Sample Code:

def main():

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read().split()

ptr = 0

t = int(input[ptr])

ptr += 1

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input[ptr])

m = int(input[ptr+1])

ptr += 2

a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))

ptr += n

s = input[ptr]

ptr += 1

# Reverse s

s_rev = s[::-1]

# Initialize deque and product

from collections import deque

dq = deque()

p = 1

products = []

for cmd in s_rev:

if cmd == 'L':

# Add to left

elem = a.pop()

dq.appendleft(elem)

p = (p * elem) % m

products.append(p)

elif cmd == 'R':

# Add to right

elem = a.pop(0)

dq.append(elem)

p = (p * elem) % m

products.append(p)

# Reverse products and print

output = reversed(products)

print(' '.join(map(str, output)))

if __name__ == "__main__":

main()

Wait, but in this code, I'm using a list a and popping elements from it.

But in the reversed sequence, for 'L' in original means adding to the left in reversed, which corresponds to popping from the end of the original a list.

Similarly, 'R' in original means adding to the right in reversed, which corresponds to popping from the front of the original a list.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the indices carefully.

Let me think again.

In the original sequence:

- 'L' means remove from left.

- 'R' means remove from right.

In the reversed sequence:

- 'L' means add to left.

- 'R' means add to right.

But the elements to add back are in the order they were removed in the original sequence.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to collect the removed elements in a list and then add them back in reverse order.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me consider that in the reversed sequence, I need to add back the elements in the order opposite to which they were removed in the original sequence.

So, if the original s is "LRRL", then reversed s is "LRRL".

Then, for each command in reversed s:

- 'L': add to left.

- 'R': add to right.

But I need to know which elements to add back.

Wait, perhaps it's better to collect the removed elements in a separate list and then add them back in the reversed order.

Let me try that.

In the original sequence:

- Start with a = [3,1,4,2]

- s = "LRRL"

- Step 1: 'L' -> remove 3, output product of [1,4,2] mod 6 = 8 mod 6 = 2

- Step 2: 'R' -> remove 2, output product of [1,4] mod 6 = 4 mod 6 = 4

- Step 3: 'R' -> remove 4, output product of [1] mod 6 = 1 mod 6 = 1

- Step 4: 'L' -> remove 1, empty array.

So, the removed elements in order are: 3,2,4,1

In reversed order, they are: 1,4,2,3

So, in the reversed sequence:

- Start with empty array.

- Add 1 to left -> array = [1]

- Add 4 to right -> array = [1,4]

- Add 2 to right -> array = [1,4,2]

- Add 3 to left -> array = [3,1,4,2]

And the products in this reversed sequence are:

- After adding 1: 1 mod 6 = 1

- After adding 4: 1*4 mod 6 = 4

- After adding 2: 1*4*2 mod 6 = 8 mod 6 = 2

- After adding 3: 1*4*2*3 mod 6 = 24 mod 6 = 0

Then, reversing these products gives: 0,2,4,1, which matches the sample output.

Perfect.

So, in code, I can:

- Reverse s.

- Initialize an empty deque.

- Initialize p = 1.

- Initialize a list to store products.

- For each cmd in reversed s:

- If cmd is 'L', add a.pop() to the left of deque.

- Else, cmd is 'R', add a.pop(0) to the right of deque.

- Update p = (p * added_element) % m

- Append p to products list.

- After processing all cmds, reverse the products list and print them.

Wait, but in the above code snippet, I used a.pop() for 'L' and a.pop(0) for 'R'.

But in Python, popping from index 0 is inefficient for large lists because it requires shifting elements.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to pop elements from both ends.

To handle this efficiently, I can use a deque for the array a as well, since deques allow O(1) pops from both ends.

So, I'll convert the list a to a deque, and then for 'L' in reversed s, I can pop from the right of this deque (since it corresponds to the end of the original a list), and for 'R' in reversed s, I can pop from the left of this deque (since it corresponds to the start of the original a list).

Wait, let's think carefully.

Original sequence:

- 'L' means remove from left of a.

- 'R' means remove from right of a.

In reversed sequence:

- 'L' means add to left of dq.

- 'R' means add to right of dq.

The elements to add back are in the order they were removed in the original sequence.

So, if I have a deque for the array a, then:

- For 'L' in reversed s, I should add a.pop() to the left of dq.

- For 'R' in reversed s, I should add a.popleft() to the right of dq.

Because:

- In the original sequence, 'L' removes from the left, so in reversed sequence, 'L' adds to the left.

- Similarly, 'R' in original removes from the right, so in reversed sequence, 'R' adds to the right.

And the elements to add back are in the order they were removed, which is the order in the string s.

Wait, but in Python, deque.pop() removes from the right, and deque.popleft() removes from the left.

So, if I have a deque representing the original array a, with a[0] on the left and a[n-1] on the right.

Then, for 'L' in reversed s, I need to add to the left of dq, and the element to add is the last removed element, which is at the end of the original removal sequence.

In other words, in the reversed sequence, the first command corresponds to the last removal in the original sequence, so the element to add back is the last element of the original a if the command is 'L', or the first element of the original a if the command is 'R'.

Wait, maybe it's easier to collect the removed elements in a separate list and then pop them in reverse order.

But that might not be efficient.

Let me try with an example.

Take n=4, a=[3,1,4,2], s="LRRL"

Reversed s is "LRRL"

Initialize dq = deque()

a = deque([3,1,4,2])

For each cmd in reversed s:

1. cmd='L' -> add to left of dq the last removed element, which is 1

- So, dq = deque([1])

- p = 1 % 6 = 1

- products = [1]

2. cmd='R' -> add to right of dq the last removed element, which is 4

- dq = deque([1,4])

- p = 1*4 % 6 = 4

- products = [1,4]

3. cmd='R' -> add to right of dq the last removed element, which is 2

- dq = deque([1,4,2])

- p = 4*2 % 6 = 8 % 6 = 2

- products = [1,4,2]

4. cmd='L' -> add to left of dq the last removed element, which is 3

- dq = deque([3,1,4,2])

- p = 2*3 % 6 = 6 % 6 = 0

- products = [1,4,2,0]

Then, reverse products to get [0,2,4,1], which matches the sample output.

So, in code, I need to:

- Read a as a deque.

- Reverse s.

- For each cmd in reversed s:

- If cmd is 'L', add a.pop() to the left of dq.

- Else, cmd is 'R', add a.popleft() to the right of dq.

- Update p = (p * added_element) % m

- Append p to products list.

- After processing all cmds, reverse products and print.

This seems correct.

Let me confirm with another example.

Take n=5, m=1

a=[1,1,1,1,1]

s="LLLLL"

Reversed s is "LLLLL"

a = deque([1,1,1,1,1])

dq = deque()

products = []

For each cmd in reversed s:

1. cmd='L' -> add a.pop() to the left of dq -> dq=deque([1])

- p = 1 % 1 = 0

- products=[0]

2. cmd='L' -> add a.pop() to the left of dq -> dq=deque([1,1])

- p = 0 * 1 % 1 = 0

- products=[0,0]

3. cmd='L' -> add a.pop() to the left of dq -> dq=deque([1,1,1])

- p = 0 * 1 % 1 =
