Alright, I've got this problem here. It seems a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So, the problem is about disks in a plane. Each disk has its center at integer coordinates and a positive integer radius. The key points are that no two disks overlap in a positive area, but they can be tangent to each other. My task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii of these disks in such a way that:

1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

2. No two disks overlap in a positive area.

3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

And importantly, the new radii can be any positive real numbers, and the centers remain fixed.

First, I need to understand what it means for disks to be tangent. If two disks are tangent, it means they touch at exactly one point. In terms of their centers and radii, if disk A has center (x1, y1) and radius r1, and disk B has center (x2, y2) and radius r2, then they are tangent if the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii, i.e., sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) = r1 + r2.

Given that, the problem allows me to change the radii as long as tangencies are preserved, meaning that if two disks were tangent before, they should still be tangent after the change. Also, no two disks should overlap, which means that for any two disks that were not tangent before, their new radii should satisfy that the distance between their centers is greater than or equal to the sum of their new radii.

Additionally, I need to ensure that the sum of all radii strictly decreases.

So, how can I approach this?

I think one way to look at this is to consider the constraints imposed by the tangencies. If two disks are tangent, their radii must satisfy the equation derived from the tangent condition. So, for each pair of tangent disks, I have an equation that relates their radii.

Let's formalize this.

Let’s denote the new radius of disk i as r_i'. The conditions are:

1. For each pair of tangent disks (i,j), the new radii must satisfy:

sqrt((xj - xi)^2 + (yj - yi)^2) = r_i' + r_j'

2. For each pair of non-tangent disks (i,j), the new radii must satisfy:

sqrt((xj - xi)^2 + (yj - yi)^2) >= r_i' + r_j'

And, of course, the sum of all r_i' must be strictly less than the sum of the original radii.

Now, this seems like a system of equations and inequalities involving the new radii r_i'. Solving such a system directly might be complicated, especially since the radii can be any positive real numbers.

Is there a smarter way to approach this?

I recall that in some optimization problems, particularly those involving linear constraints, we can model the problem using graph theory or linear algebra.

Let me think about modeling this as a graph.

Suppose I create a graph where each disk is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if their corresponding disks are tangent. So, this graph represents the tangency relationships.

Now, for the radii adjustments, I need to assign new radii to each node such that for each edge (representing tangent disks), the sum of the new radii equals the distance between the centers. For non-adjacent nodes, the sum of their new radii should be less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

Moreover, the sum of all new radii should be strictly less than the sum of the original radii.

This seems complex, but perhaps I can look for conditions under which such adjustments are possible.

Let me consider the system of equations for the tangent pairs.

Suppose there are m tangent pairs. Each tangent pair gives me an equation of the form:

r_i' + r_j' = d_{ij}

where d_{ij} is the distance between the centers of disks i and j.

This is a system of linear equations in the variables r_i'.

Similarly, for non-tangent pairs, I have inequalities:

r_i' + r_j' <= d_{ij}

But dealing with inequalities complicates things. Maybe I can focus first on the equalities and see what solutions satisfy them, then check the inequalities and the sum condition.

So, let's consider only the equations from the tangent pairs.

This gives me a system of linear equations.

The solution space of this system depends on the number of equations and variables.

If the system is consistent, it will have either a unique solution or infinitely many solutions, depending on the rank of the system.

But in this case, since radii must be positive, I have to ensure that the solutions are positive real numbers.

Moreover, I need to ensure that for non-tangent pairs, the sum of their new radii is less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

And finally, the sum of all new radii is strictly less than the sum of the original radii.

This seems involved. Is there a simpler way to look at this?

Perhaps I can think about adjusting the radii in such a way that I decrease some radii and increase others, but overall the sum decreases, while maintaining the tangencies.

Wait, but if I have to maintain the tangencies, that means for tangent pairs, the sum of their radii must remain equal to the distance between their centers.

So, for those pairs, r_i' + r_j' = d_{ij}

For non-tangent pairs, r_i' + r_j' <= d_{ij}

And I want to minimize the sum of r_i', but ensure it's strictly less than the original sum.

But actually, the problem just asks if it's possible to make such adjustments with the sum strictly decreasing; it doesn't ask for the minimal sum or anything like that.

So, perhaps I can consider the minimal sum of r_i' that satisfies all the equations and inequalities, and check if that sum is strictly less than the original sum.

But that might be too involved.

Is there a different approach?

Let me consider the dual problem: what if I fix the sum of the new radii to be less than the original sum, and see if I can find radii that satisfy the tangency conditions.

But that still seems complicated.

Maybe I can think about the problem in terms of graph theory.

Given the graph where nodes are disks and edges are tangencies, I can consider connected components.

Within each connected component, the radii are interdependent because of the tangent constraints.

So, perhaps I can handle each connected component separately.

In each connected component, the system of equations from the tangent pairs will relate the radii of the disks in that component.

So, for a connected component with k disks, I have k variables and (number of tangent pairs) equations.

The number of equations is at most k*(k-1)/2, but in practice, it's equal to the number of tangent pairs, which is less than or equal to k-1 if the component is a tree, or more if there are cycles.

Wait, actually, in graph theory terms, the number of independent equations is related to the number of edges and the connectivity of the component.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me consider a simpler case: suppose there is only one connected component, and it's a tree.

In a tree with k nodes, there are k-1 edges.

So, I have k variables and k-1 equations.

This means that the system has one degree of freedom.

I can choose one radius freely and solve for the others based on the equations.

Given that, I can choose the radii in such a way that the sum decreases, provided that there is some flexibility in the system.

But I need to ensure that all radii remain positive.

Similarly, if there are cycles in the component, the system might be more constrained.

Wait, if there are cycles, the system could be overconstrained, potentially leading to inconsistencies unless the distances satisfy certain conditions.

But in this problem, since the disks are already placed without overlapping, the distances are fixed.

So, perhaps I need to check for each connected component if the system of equations is consistent, and if so, see if I can adjust the radii to satisfy the sum decreasing condition.

This sounds like a plan.

So, here's what I need to do:

1. Build a graph where nodes are disks and edges are tangent pairs.

2. Find the connected components of this graph.

3. For each connected component, solve the system of equations defined by the tangent pairs to find the relationships between the radii.

4. Check if it's possible to assign new radii that satisfy:

a. The equations for tangent pairs.

b. The inequalities for non-tangent pairs.

c. The sum of new radii is strictly less than the sum of original radii.

d. All new radii are positive real numbers.

This seems manageable.

Let's consider step 3 in more detail.

For a connected component with k disks and m tangent pairs, I have m equations of the form r_i' + r_j' = d_{ij}

This is a system of linear equations.

I can represent it in matrix form as A * r' = b, where A is a matrix with rows corresponding to equations, and columns to variables (radii), and b is the vector of d_{ij}.

I need to find if there exists a solution r' > 0 such that A * r' = b and sum(r') < sum(r_original).

First, I need to check if the system A * r' = b has a solution.

If the system is consistent, then I can proceed.

If it's inconsistent, then it's impossible to adjust the radii while maintaining the tangencies.

Assuming the system is consistent, I need to find if there exists a solution where r' > 0 and sum(r') < sum(r_original).

This seems like a linear programming problem, but perhaps there's a simpler way to check this.

Let me consider that in a connected component, once I fix one radius, the others are determined by the equations.

For example, in a tree structure, choosing one radius fixes the others.

In a cycle, the equations might impose additional constraints.

So, in a tree, I have one degree of freedom, and I can choose one radius and solve for the others.

In a cycle, the equations might be dependent, and I need to ensure that the cycle conditions are satisfied.

This seems complicated.

Is there a better way?

Let me think about the sum of radii.

Suppose I have a connected component with k disks.

If I can express all radii in terms of one variable, say r_1', then I can express the sum of radii in terms of r_1' and find if there exists a value of r_1' such that the sum is less than the original sum, while all radii remain positive.

This might work for tree structures.

But for cycles, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the differences between new and original radii.

Let’s define delta_i = r_i' - r_i

Then, the conditions become:

For tangent pairs (i,j):

delta_i + delta_j = 0

Because r_i' + r_j' = r_i + r_j

So, delta_i + delta_j = 0

For non-tangent pairs (i,j):

delta_i + delta_j <= d_{ij} - (r_i + r_j)

But d_{ij} >= r_i + r_j, since no overlapping.

So, delta_i + delta_j <= d_{ij} - (r_i + r_j) >= 0

But I'm more interested in the sum of deltas being negative, since sum(r_i') < sum(r_i) implies sum(delta_i) < 0

Wait, actually, sum(r_i') < sum(r_i) implies sum(delta_i) < 0

So, I need sum(delta_i) < 0

Now, from the tangent pairs, delta_i + delta_j = 0

So, for each tangent pair, delta_i = -delta_j

This is interesting.

So, in a connected component, if I have a chain of tangent pairs, the deltas alternate in sign.

For example, if disk A is tangent to disk B, then delta_A = -delta_B

If disk B is tangent to disk C, then delta_B = -delta_C, so delta_A = delta_C

And so on.

So, in a connected component, the disks can be divided into two groups where all disks in one group have delta_i = c, and the other group has delta_i = -c, for some c.

Wait, actually, it's more general than that.

Let's consider a connected component.

Since for tangent pairs, delta_i + delta_j = 0, which means delta_i = -delta_j

So, in a connected component, the deltas are determined up to a sign.

Specifically, if I fix the delta for one disk, the deltas for all other disks in the component are determined based on their connections.

This is similar to a bipartite graph, where disks can be assigned to two groups, and deltas in one group are c, and in the other group are -c.

Wait, but it's not necessarily bipartite, because there might be cycles.

Wait, actually, it's similar to assigning signs based on a graph traversal.

Let me think about it.

Suppose I pick a starting disk in the component and assign it a delta value, say c.

Then, for each disk connected to it (tangent pairs), their delta is -c.

Then, for disks connected to those, their delta is c, and so on.

This is similar to a bipartition of the graph.

But, if the graph has an odd cycle, this might lead to inconsistency, because going around the cycle would force c = -c, which implies c = 0.

But if there are no odd cycles, i.e., the graph is bipartite, then I can assign c and -c to the two partitions.

So, in a bipartite graph, I can assign c to one partition and -c to the other, and choose c such that all r_i' = r_i + delta_i > 0 and sum(delta_i) < 0.

In non-bipartite graphs, if there are odd cycles, I might not be able to assign deltas in this way without inconsistency.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that no two disks overlap in a positive area, but they can be tangent. So, the graph is built based on tangencies, which should not inherently create overlapping disks.

But, in terms of the graph, it's possible to have cycles, both even and odd.

So, perhaps I need to check for each connected component whether the graph is bipartite.

If it's bipartite, then I can assign c and -c to the two partitions, and choose c such that all r_i' > 0 and sum(delta_i) < 0.

If it's not bipartite, there might be constraints that make it impossible to have such delta assignments.

Wait, but in the problem, disks can be tangent, but not overlap. So, the graph is built based on tangencies, which are like equality constraints.

So, perhaps the graph being bipartite is a necessary condition for being able to adjust radii in the desired manner.

But I need to verify this.

Let me consider a simple example.

Suppose there are two disks tangent to each other.

Then, delta_1 + delta_2 = 0, so delta_1 = -delta_2

To have sum(delta_i) < 0, I need delta_1 + delta_2 < 0, but delta_1 + delta_2 = 0, so it's impossible.

Wait, but in this case, sum(delta_i) = 0, which does not satisfy sum(delta_i) < 0.

So, in this case, it's impossible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

So, for two tangent disks, it's impossible to decrease the sum of radii.

Similarly, if I have a chain of tangent disks, like A tangent to B, B tangent to C, etc., then deltas alternate in sign.

So, for example, delta_A = c, delta_B = -c, delta_C = c, and so on.

Then, the sum of deltas would be c - c + c - c + ... which could be positive or negative depending on the number of disks.

But in any case, to have sum(delta_i) < 0, I need to choose c such that the sum is negative.

But, I also need to ensure that all r_i' > 0, which translates to r_i + delta_i > 0 for all i.

So, in this setup, it's possible only if choosing c appropriately.

But in the two-disk case, sum(delta_i) = 0, so it's impossible.

In a three-disk chain, sum(delta_i) = c - c + c = c, so choosing c < 0 would make sum(delta_i) < 0, but then r_i' > 0 must hold.

So, it's possible only if c is chosen such that r_i + delta_i > 0 for all i.

Similarly, in a four-disk chain, sum(delta_i) = c - c + c - c = 0, which again doesn't allow sum(delta_i) < 0.

Wait, so in even-sized components, the sum of deltas is zero, and in odd-sized components, the sum is c, where c can be chosen positive or negative.

Wait, but in a three-disk chain, sum(delta_i) = c - c + c = 2c.

Wait, no, sum(delta_i) = c - c + c = c.

Wait, let's see:

Suppose I have disks A, B, C, with A tangent to B, and B tangent to C.

Then, delta_A = c, delta_B = -c, delta_C = c.

So, sum(delta_i) = c - c + c = c.

Similarly, in a four-disk chain A-B-C-D, with A tangent to B, B tangent to C, C tangent to D.

Then, delta_A = c, delta_B = -c, delta_C = c, delta_D = -c.

Sum(delta_i) = c - c + c - c = 0.

So, in even-sized components, sum(delta_i) = 0, and in odd-sized components, sum(delta_i) = c.

Therefore, only in odd-sized components can I have sum(delta_i) < 0 by choosing c < 0.

But, I need to ensure that all r_i' > 0, which is r_i + delta_i > 0.

So, in odd-sized components, I can choose c < 0, but sufficiently large in magnitude to make sum(delta_i) < 0, while ensuring that r_i + delta_i > 0 for all i.

This seems feasible under certain conditions.

Now, what about components with cycles?

If a component has an odd cycle, then trying to assign deltas as c and -c to bipartitions would lead to inconsistency, because in an odd cycle, you cannot bipartition the graph.

Wait, in an odd cycle, if I try to assign c and -c alternately, I'll end up with a contradiction because the last connection would force c = -c, implying c = 0.

Therefore, in components with odd cycles, the only solution is c = 0, which means delta_i = 0 for all i in that component.

Hence, in such components, I cannot have sum(delta_i) < 0 because sum(delta_i) = 0.

Therefore, only in bipartite components with an odd number of disks can I potentially have sum(delta_i) < 0 by choosing c < 0.

Wait, but in bipartite components, the number of disks in each partition may differ, so sum(delta_i) would be (number of disks in partition A)*c + (number of disks in partition B)*(-c) = (|A| - |B|)*c.

So, if |A| != |B|, then sum(delta_i) = (|A| - |B|)*c, which can be made negative by choosing c < 0 if |A| < |B|, or c > 0 if |A| > |B|.

But in bipartite graphs, |A| can be equal to |B|, or not.

Wait, but in bipartite graphs, |A| doesn't have to equal |B|.

So, if |A| > |B|, then sum(delta_i) = (|A| - |B|)*c, which can be made negative by choosing c < 0.

Similarly, if |A| < |B|, sum(delta_i) = (|A| - |B|)*c, which can be made negative by choosing c < 0 if |A| > |B|, but if |A| < |B|, then to make sum(delta_i) < 0, choose c > 0.

Wait, no.

Let's think carefully.

sum(delta_i) = |A|*c + |B|*(-c) = (|A| - |B|)*c

To have sum(delta_i) < 0:

(|A| - |B|)*c < 0

If |A| > |B|, then choose c < 0.

If |A| < |B|, then choose c > 0.

If |A| = |B|, then sum(delta_i) = 0, which doesn't satisfy sum(delta_i) < 0.

Therefore, in bipartite components where |A| != |B|, I can choose c appropriately to make sum(delta_i) < 0.

In components that are not bipartite (i.e., have odd cycles), sum(delta_i) = 0, so it's impossible to have sum(delta_i) < 0.

Therefore, the condition for a component to allow sum(delta_i) < 0 is that the component is bipartite and |A| != |B|.

Moreover, I need to ensure that all r_i' > 0, which is r_i + delta_i > 0.

Given that delta_i = c if i is in A, and delta_i = -c if i is in B.

Therefore, for all i in A, r_i + c > 0, which implies c > -r_i.

Similarly, for all i in B, r_i - c > 0, which implies c < r_i.

Therefore, c must satisfy:

c > -min_{i in A} r_i

and

c < min_{i in B} r_i

So, c must be in the interval (-min_A r_i, min_B r_i)

To have sum(delta_i) < 0, choose c such that (|A| - |B|)*c < 0.

If |A| > |B|, choose c < 0, but c must be greater than -min_A r_i and less than min_B r_i.

Similarly, if |A| < |B|, choose c > 0, but still within the interval.

Therefore, for each bipartite component where |A| != |B|, I can choose c appropriately to make sum(delta_i) < 0, provided that the interval for c allows for such a choice.

In non-bipartite components, sum(delta_i) = 0, so it's impossible to have sum(delta_i) < 0.

Therefore, the overall sum of deltas can be made less than zero if there exists at least one bipartite component with |A| != |B|, and the chosen c for that component contributes negatively to the sum.

Moreover, the choices in different components are independent, so I can adjust c in one component without affecting others.

Therefore, if there is at least one bipartite component with |A| != |B|, and the conditions on c can be satisfied, then it's possible to have sum(delta_i) < 0.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to:

1. Build the graph of tangent pairs.

2. Find the connected components.

3. For each connected component, check if it's bipartite.

4. If it's bipartite, find |A| and |B|, and check if |A| != |B|.

5. Additionally, ensure that for each bipartite component with |A| != |B|, there exists a c in the required interval.

But since the problem only asks for the possibility, and doesn't require actual radii adjustment, I can assume that if a component is bipartite and |A| != |B|, then such a c exists.

Therefore, if there exists at least one bipartite connected component with |A| != |B|, then it's possible to decrease the sum of radii.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Hence, the answer is "YES" if there exists at least one bipartite connected component with |A| != |B|, and "NO" otherwise.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the sum of deltas can be made strictly less than zero.

Given that, and that in non-bipartite components sum(delta_i) = 0, then indeed, if there is at least one bipartite component with |A| != |B|, then I can make sum(delta_i) < 0 by choosing appropriate c for that component, and set c = 0 for all other components.

Therefore, the overall sum of deltas would be less than zero due to that component.

Hence, the answer is "YES" if there exists at least one bipartite connected component with |A| != |B|, and "NO" otherwise.

Now, I need to implement this logic.

Given that n can be up to 1000, and the graph can have up to C(n,2) edges, I need an efficient way to handle this.

But since the graph is built based on tangencies, and n is up to 1000, it's manageable.

Let me outline the steps in code:

1. Read n.

2. Read n disks with their centers (x,y) and radii r.

3. Build the graph:

- Create a graph with n nodes.

- For each pair of disks, check if they are tangent.

- If they are tangent, add an edge between them.

4. Find connected components.

5. For each connected component, check if it's bipartite and if |A| != |B|.

6. If any component satisfies bipartite and |A| != |B|, then answer "YES", else "NO".

But implementing this efficiently is crucial.

To check if a component is bipartite, I can perform a BFS traversal from a starting node, assigning colors (A or B) alternately, and check for consistency.

同时，我需要计算每个双色组件中的 |A| 和 |B|。

但是，我需要确保所有变量都在正确的范围内，并且选择的 c 值使得所有新的半径都是正数。

不过，由于问题只是询问是否可能，我可以假设如果组件是双色的并且 |A| != |B|，那么存在这样的 c 值。

因此，我的主要任务是检查图中是否存在至少一个双色连通分量，其中 |A| != |B|。

现在，我需要实现这个逻辑。

让我考虑一下如何实现这一点。

首先，构建图：

- 每个磁盘是一个节点。

- 如果两个磁盘相切，则它们之间有一条边。

然后，进行连通分量的遍历。

对于每个连通分量，执行 BFS 来检查是否是双色图，并计算 |A| 和 |B|。

如果找到至少一个双色连通分量，其中 |A| != |B|，则输出 "YES"，否则输出 "NO"。

现在，我需要处理输入和构建图。

由于 n 可以达到 1000，直接计算所有对的时间复杂度是 O(n^2)，这可能太慢了。

但是，n=1000 时，O(n^2) 是一百万次操作，对于现代计算机来说是可以接受的，特别是因为时间限制是 2 秒。

所以，我可以接受 O(n^2) 的时间复杂度来构建图。

但是，我需要优化其他部分以确保代码运行在时间限制内。

现在，我需要编写代码来构建图。

我需要计算每对磁盘之间的距离，并检查是否相切。

具体来说，对于每对磁盘 i 和 j，计算距离 d = sqrt((x[i]-x[j])^2 + (y[i]-y[j])^2)，然后检查是否 d == r[i] + r[j]。

但是，由于涉及浮点数运算，我需要小心处理浮点精度问题。

为了避免浮点数运算带来的精度问题，我可以比较 d^2 和 (r[i] + r[j])^2 是否相等。

因为 d^2 = (x[j]-x[i])^2 + (y[j]-y[i])^2，而 (r[i] + r[j])^2 = r[i]^2 + 2*r[i]*r[j] + r[j]^2。

所以，我可以通过比较 (x[j]-x[i])^2 + (y[j]-y[i])^2 == (r[i] + r[j])^2 来判断两个磁盘是否相切。

这样可以避免浮点数运算，直接使用整数运算。

这很好。

接下来，我需要构建图的邻接表。

然后，进行连通分量的遍历。

对于每个连通分量，执行 BFS 检查是否是双色图，并计算 |A| 和 |B|。

如果在任何双色连通分量中 |A| != |B|，则可以减少总半径，输出 "YES"。

否则，输出 "NO"。

现在，我需要实现这个算法。

我需要特别注意图的构建和 BFS 的实现。

此外，由于 n 可以达到 1000，我需要确保代码是高效的。

让我开始编写代码。

首先，读取 n。

然后，读取 n 个磁盘的坐标和半径。

然后，构建图的邻接表。

对于每对磁盘，计算 (x[j]-x[i])^2 + (y[j]-y[i])^2，并与 (r[i] + r[j])^2 比较。

如果相等，则添加边。

然后，进行连通分量的遍历。

使用 BFS，对于每个未访问的节点，执行 BFS，并检查是否是双色图，同时计算 |A| 和 |B|。

如果找到 |A| != |B| 的双色连通分量，则设置一个标志位为 True。

最后，根据标志位输出 "YES" 或 "NO"。

现在，我需要实现这个逻辑。

我需要定义图的表示，使用邻接表。

使用列表的列表来表示邻接表。

然后，使用 BFS 遍历每个连通分量。

在 BFS 中，维护一个颜色数组，表示每个节点属于哪一组。

同时，计算 |A| 和 |B|。

如果发现冲突，即图不是双色图，则设置 bipartite = False。

如果是双色图，并且 |A| != |B|，则设置标志位为 True。

最后，根据标志位输出结果。

现在，我需要处理数据范围。

n <= 1000，坐标和半径的范围是 -1e9 到 1e9，因此需要使用长整型来存储坐标和半径。

在 Python 中，整数可以任意大，所以不需要担心溢出。

但是，需要确保计算 (x[j]-x[i])^2 + (y[j]-y[i])^2 时不溢出。

在 Python 中，整数可以很大，所以应该没有问题。

现在，我需要实现 BFS 函数。

定义一个 BFS 函数，接受起始节点索引。

初始化颜色数组，例如，colors[i] 表示节点 i 的颜色，0 表示未访问，1 和 -1 表示两种颜色。

使用一个队列来执行 BFS。

从起始节点开始，设置颜色为 1，将其加入队列。

然后，循环处理队列，对于每个节点，遍历其邻居。

如果邻居未访问，赋予相反的颜色，加入队列。

如果邻居已访问，检查颜色是否与预期相反，如果不是，则图不是双色图。

同时，统计 |A| 和 |B|。

最后，检查 bipartite 是否为 True，并且 |A| != |B|。

如果找到这样的连通分量，设置标志位为 True。

然后，继续处理其他连通分量。

最后，根据标志位输出 "YES" 或 "NO"。

现在，我需要实现这个逻辑。

我需要定义 visited 数组来跟踪已访问的节点。

还需要定义 colors 数组来跟踪每个节点的颜色。

此外，需要定义 count_A 和 count_B 来统计 |A| 和 |B|。

在 BFS 中，初始化 count_A 和 count_B 为 0。

每当赋予节点颜色 1 时，count_A += 1。

赋予颜色 -1 时，count_B += 1。

然后，检查 bipartite and (count_A != count_B)，如果为真，则设置标志位为 True。

现在，我需要编写代码。

首先，读取 n。

然后，读取 n 个磁盘的坐标和半径。

然后，构建邻接表。

对于 i from 0 to n-1:

for j from i+1 to n-1:

dx = x[j] - x[i]

dy = y[j] - y[i]

if dx*dx + dy*dy == (r[i] + r[j])*(r[i] + r[j]):

添加边 i-j

添加边 j-i

然后，初始化 visited 数组为 False。

初始化标志位 ok = False。

然后，对于每个未访问的节点 i：

如果 not visited[i]：

执行 BFS(i)

在 BFS 中：

初始化 bipartite = True

初始化 count_A = 0

初始化 count_B = 0

初始化 colors[i] = 1

count_A += 1

队列 q = [i]

while q 不空：

u = q.pop(0)

for 每个邻居 v of u:

if not visited[v]:

colors[v] = -colors[u]

if colors[v] == 1:

count_A += 1

else:

count_B += 1

visited[v] = True

q.append(v)

else:

if colors[v] != -colors[u]:

bipartite = False

if bipartite and count_A != count_B:

ok = True

最后，如果 ok 为 True，输出 "YES"，否则输出 "NO"。

这应该是正确的。

让我检查一下。

在 BFS 中，我需要确保在访问每个节点时设置 visited[v] = True。

同时，需要正确维护 colors 和 count_A、count_B。

此外，需要确保在检查邻居时，只有未访问的邻居才被赋予颜色并加入队列。

已访问的邻居用于检查是否符合双色条件。

看起来没问题。

现在，我需要考虑时间复杂度。

构建图的时间复杂度是 O(n^2)，对于 n=1000，是 1e6 次操作，可以接受。

BFS 的时间复杂度是 O(n + m)，其中 m 是边数。

在最坏情况下，m = O(n^2)，所以总时间复杂度是 O(n^2)，可以接受。

因此，这个算法是可行的。

现在，我需要实现代码。

但是，由于我是在写解决方案，而不是实际编写代码，所以我只需要描述代码的逻辑。

不过，为了确保逻辑正确，我可以写出伪代码。

伪代码如下：

n = int(input())

x = [0] * n

y = [0] * n

r = [0] * n

for i in range(n):

x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())

# 构建邻接表

adj = [ [] for _ in range(n) ]

for i in range(n):

for j in range(i+1, n):

dx = x[j] - x[i]

dy = y[j] - y[i]

if dx*dx + dy*dy == (r[i] + r[j])*(r[i] + r[j]):

adj[i].append(j)

adj[j].append(i)

visited = [False] * n

colors = [0] * n

ok = False

for i in range(n):

if not visited[i]:

bipartite = True

count_A = 0

count_B = 0

colors[i] = 1

count_A += 1

q = [i]

visited[i] = True

while q:

u = q.pop(0)

for v in adj[u]:

if not visited[v]:

colors[v] = -colors[u]

if colors[v] == 1:

count_A += 1

else:

count_B += 1

visited[v] = True

q.append(v)

else:

if colors[v] != -colors[u]:

bipartite = False

if bipartite and count_A != count_B:

ok = True

if ok:

print("YES")

else:

print("NO")

这应该就是正确的实现。

现在，我需要检查是否有任何边缘情况。

例如：

- n = 1：只有一个磁盘，没有相切的磁盘，所以无法减少总半径，因为没有约束，但根据问题描述，不能改变单个磁盘的半径以减少总和，因为没有相切约束。

Wait, actually, if n=1, there are no tangent pairs, so I can decrease the radius of the single disk, as there are no constraints from other disks.

But according to the problem, the disks cannot overlap, and they can be tangent.

But if there are no tangent pairs, then I can freely decrease the radius of the single disk, as long as it remains positive.

But in this case, since there are no tangent pairs, I can decrease the radius of the single disk, thus decreasing the sum of radii.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, this would be handled as a connected component with one disk, which is bipartite with |A| = 1, |B| = 0, so |A| != |B|, hence "YES".

But actually, in this case, since there are no tangent pairs, the graph is empty, and the component is just a single node.

In this case, |A| = 1, |B| = 0, which satisfies |A| != |B|, so "YES".

But, according to the problem statement, in the first sample input, there are tangent pairs, and adjusting the radii accordingly.

In the second sample, it's a fully connected component where adjusting radii doesn't allow the sum to decrease.

But in the case of a single disk, it's possible to decrease its radius, so "YES".

Another edge case is when all disks are tangent to each other in such a way that the graph is fully connected and bipartite with |A| != |B|.

In that case, it should be "YES".

If the graph is not bipartite, then "NO".

If the graph has multiple components, and at least one is bipartite with |A| != |B|, then "YES".

Otherwise, "NO".

I think this covers all cases.

Therefore, the correctness of this approach is True.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of given disks in such a way that the sum of their radii strictly decreases, while maintaining tangency between disks that were originally tangent and ensuring no two disks overlap in a positive area.

### Approach

1. **Graph Construction**:
    - Represent each disk as a node in a graph.
    - Connect two nodes with an edge if their corresponding disks are tangent.

2. **Connected Components Analysis**:
    - For each connected component in the graph, check if it is bipartite and if the two partitions of the bipartition have unequal sizes.
    - If any connected component is bipartite with unequal partition sizes, it is possible to adjust the radii to strictly decrease the sum while maintaining tangencies.

3. **Bipartite Check**:
    - Use BFS to check if a component is bipartite and compute the sizes of the two partitions.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    x = [0] * n
    y = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
    
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            dx = x[j] - x[i]
            dy = y[j] - y[i]
            if dx * dx + dy * dy == (r[i] + r[j]) * (r[i] + r[j]):
                adj[i].append(j)
                adj[j].append(i)
    
    visited = [False] * n
    colors = [0] * n
    ok = False
    
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            bipartite = True
            count_A = 0
            count_B = 0
            colors[i] = 1
            count_A += 1
            q = [i]
            visited[i] = True
            while q:
                u = q.pop(0)
                for v in adj[u]:
                    if not visited[v]:
                        colors[v] = -colors[u]
                        if colors[v] == 1:
                            count_A += 1
                        else:
                            count_B += 1
                        visited[v] = True
                        q.append(v)
                    else:
                        if colors[v] != -colors[u]:
                            bipartite = False
            if bipartite and count_A != count_B:
                ok = True
                break  # No need to check further
    
    print("YES" if ok else "NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Construction**:
    - We build a graph where each disk is a node, and edges connect tangent disks.

2. **Connected Component Analysis**:
    - For each connected component, perform a BFS to check if it is bipartite and compute the sizes of the two partitions.
    - If any component is bipartite with unequal partition sizes, it is possible to adjust radii to decrease the sum strictly while maintaining tangencies.

3. **Bipartite Check**:
    - During BFS, assign colors alternately to nodes and ensure no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
    - Count nodes in each color partition to check if their sizes are unequal.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the possibility of adjusting radii under the given constraints efficiently.
