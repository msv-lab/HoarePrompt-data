Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, using this cutting and rearranging method.

First, I need to understand the process step by step.

1. **Cutting the rectangle:**

   - Bob can make a cut parallel to one of the sides. So, if he has a rectangle of size a × b, he can either cut it parallel to the side of length a or parallel to the side of length b.

   - If he cuts parallel to side a, he's essentially dividing side b into two parts. Let's say he cuts side b into b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

   - Similarly, if he cuts parallel to side b, he's dividing side a into a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = a.

2. **Forming a new rectangle:**

   - From the two resulting rectangles, he can arrange them to form a new rectangle. He can rotate these pieces as he wishes.

   - The goal is to see if he can form a rectangle that is different from the original one. Remember, two rectangles are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by rotation. For example, a 2×3 rectangle is the same as a 3×2 rectangle.

Given that, I need to determine for given a and b whether it's possible for Bob to create a new rectangle that isn't the same as the original one.

Let me look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

**Example 1:**

- Input: 1 1

- Output: No

Explanation: A 1×1 rectangle can't be cut into two smaller rectangles because if you try to cut it, you'd get two 1×0.5 rectangles, but since we're dealing with integer sides, it's not possible. So, no new rectangle can be formed.

**Example 2:**

- Input: 2 1

- Output: No

Explanation: A 2×1 rectangle can be cut into two 1×1 rectangles. From these two 1×1 rectangles, you can only form a 1×2 or 2×1 rectangle, which is the same as the original rectangle up to rotation. So, no new rectangle.

**Example 3:**

- Input: 2 6

- Output: Yes

Explanation: A 2×6 rectangle can be cut into two 2×3 rectangles. From these, you can form a 4×3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2×6 rectangle (since 4×3 is not the same as 2×6 up to rotation).

**Example 4:**

- Input: 3 2

- Output: Yes

Explanation: A 3×2 rectangle can be cut into two 3×1 rectangles. From these, you can form a 1×6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3×2 rectangle.

**Example 5:**

- Input: 2 2

- Output: Yes

Explanation: A 2×2 square can be cut into two 1×2 rectangles. From these, you can form a 1×4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2×2 square.

**Example 6:**

- Input: 2 4

- Output: Yes

Explanation: A 2×4 rectangle can be cut into two 2×2 squares. From these, you can form a 4×2 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation, but perhaps there are other ways to cut and rearrange to get a different rectangle.

Wait, in this case, cutting parallel to the other side might yield a different result. Let's see.

- If you cut the 2×4 rectangle parallel to the side of length 2, dividing the side of length 4 into, say, 1 and 3, you get two rectangles: 2×1 and 2×3. From these, you can arrange them to form a 2×4 rectangle or perhaps a different one.

- Arranging a 2×1 and a 2×3 rectangle, you can place them side by side to form a 2×4 rectangle or stack them to form a 4×2 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

- So, in this case, it seems like you can't form a different rectangle. But the output is "Yes", so maybe there's another way.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's look back at the problem statement.

It says that Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, from these two rectangles, he can form another rectangle by arranging them, rotating and moving as he wishes.

Given that, I need to check if there's any way to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle that isn't the same as the original one up to rotation.

Looking back at the sixth example, input 2 4, output Yes. Maybe there's a way to cut and rearrange to form a different rectangle.

Wait, perhaps cutting differently. If I cut the 2×4 rectangle into two 1×4 rectangles, then I can arrange them to form a 1×8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2×4 rectangle.

Ah, that makes sense. So, in this case, cutting parallel to the side of length 2, dividing it into two 1×4 rectangles, and then arranging them to form a 1×8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2×4 rectangle.

So, the key is to see if there's a way to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then arrange them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions up to rotation.

Now, I need to generalize this for any a and b.

Let me try to find a general approach.

First, consider that a and b are both positive integers, and they can be up to 10^9, which is large, so I need an efficient solution.

I need to check for each test case whether it's possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle that isn't the same as the original one up to rotation.

Let's think about the possible cuts:

1. **Cut parallel to side a:**

   - Divide side b into b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

   - So, the two rectangles are a × b1 and a × b2.

2. **Cut parallel to side b:**

   - Divide side a into a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = a.

   - So, the two rectangles are a1 × b and a2 × b.

Now, from these two pieces, Bob can arrange them to form a new rectangle.

He can place them side by side or one above the other, and he can rotate them.

The goal is to see if the new rectangle formed has different dimensions from the original rectangle up to rotation.

Wait, up to rotation means that if the new rectangle has dimensions c × d, and c × d is the same as a × b up to rotation, then it's considered the same.

So, c × d is the same as a × b if either c = a and d = b, or c = b and d = a.

Therefore, to have a different rectangle, the new dimensions c and d should not match a and b in any rotation.

So, c ≠ a or b, and d ≠ a or b.

Wait, more precisely, the new rectangle is different if neither c = a and d = b, nor c = b and d = a.

Now, let's think about how to form the new rectangle from the two pieces.

Suppose Bob has two rectangles: p × q and r × s.

He can arrange them in different ways:

- Place them side by side horizontally: if q = s, then the new rectangle is (p + r) × q.

- Place them side by side vertically: if p = r, then the new rectangle is p × (q + s).

- Rotate them and try different arrangements.

But since he can rotate the pieces as he wishes, he can choose the orientation that allows them to form a new rectangle.

So, the key is to find a way to arrange the two pieces into a new rectangle with area equal to the original rectangle's area, but with different dimensions up to rotation.

Wait, the area of the new rectangle should be the same as the original rectangle's area, since we're just rearranging the pieces.

So, the area of the new rectangle should be a × b.

Now, the new rectangle has dimensions c × d, where c × d = a × b.

And we need c × d to be different from a × b up to rotation, meaning c ≠ a or b, and d ≠ a or b.

Wait, actually, c and d should be such that c ≠ a or b, and d ≠ a or b, because if c = a and d = b, or c = b and d = a, it's the same as the original rectangle.

But, since c × d = a × b, there might be multiple pairs (c, d) that satisfy this.

Our goal is to see if there exists at least one such pair (c, d) where c ≠ a and c ≠ b, and d ≠ a and d ≠ b.

Wait, no. More precisely, c ≠ a or c ≠ b, and d ≠ a or d ≠ b, but considering that c × d = a × b.

But actually, since c and d are factors of a × b, and we need c and d to be different from a and b in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the possible ways to arrange the two pieces.

Let's consider the two pieces after cutting.

Suppose we cut parallel to side a, dividing side b into b1 and b2.

So, we have two rectangles: a × b1 and a × b2.

Now, to form a new rectangle from these two pieces, Bob can arrange them in different ways.

Option 1: Place them side by side horizontally.

- If b1 = b2, then the new rectangle would be a × b, which is the same as the original.

- If b1 ≠ b2, perhaps he can arrange them differently.

Wait, no. If he places them side by side horizontally, the new rectangle would have width a + a = 2a and height min(b1, b2), but that might not form a proper rectangle.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Actually, since he can rotate the pieces, he can rotate one or both pieces by 90 degrees.

So, for example, the a × b1 rectangle can be rotated to b1 × a, and similarly for the a × b2 rectangle.

Then, he can arrange them side by side or one above the other.

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to side b, dividing side a into a1 and a2, he gets two rectangles a1 × b and a2 × b.

Again, he can rotate these pieces.

I need to find a general condition for when it's possible to form a new rectangle that's different from the original one.

Let me consider the total area, which is a × b.

The two pieces have areas a × b1 and a × b2, with b1 + b2 = b.

Similarly, if cutting parallel to side b, the pieces have areas a1 × b and a2 × b, with a1 + a2 = a.

Now, when rearranging the two pieces, the total area remains a × b.

So, the new rectangle must have dimensions c and d such that c × d = a × b.

And, to be different from the original rectangle up to rotation, (c, d) should not be equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

Now, I need to see if it's possible to arrange the two pieces in some way to form such a c × d rectangle.

Let me consider that Bob can arrange the two pieces side by side or one above the other, and he can rotate them.

So, for example, if he has two rectangles of sizes p × q and r × s, he can try to arrange them to form a new rectangle.

One way to approach this is to consider that the two pieces must fit together perfectly to form the new rectangle without overlapping.

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that if a or b is even, then it might be possible to cut it into two equal parts and rearrange them to form a different rectangle.

Wait, in the example where a = 2 and b = 6, it was possible to cut it into two 2 × 3 rectangles and arrange them to form a 4 × 3 rectangle, which is different from the original.

Similarly, in the case where a = 3 and b = 2, cutting into two 3 × 1 rectangles and arranging them to form a 1 × 6 rectangle, which is different from the original.

In the case where a = 2 and b = 2, cutting into two 1 × 2 rectangles and arranging them to form a 1 × 4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

In the case where a = 2 and b = 4, as I thought earlier, cutting into two 1 × 4 rectangles and arranging them to form a 1 × 8 rectangle, which is different from the original.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for input 6 3, the output is "No".

Let me see why.

If a = 6 and b = 3, cutting parallel to side a:

- Divide b into b1 and b2, say b1 = 1 and b2 = 2.

- So, two rectangles: 6 × 1 and 6 × 2.

- Arranging them side by side horizontally: 6 × (1 + 2) = 6 × 3, which is the same as the original.

- Arranging them vertically: if rotated, 1 × 6 and 2 × 6, placed side by side vertically: 6 × 3, same as original.

- Alternatively, placing them side by side horizontally: 6 × 3, same as original.

- Rotating both: 1 × 6 and 2 × 6, placed vertically: 6 × 3, same as original.

- Maybe there's no way to arrange them to form a different rectangle.

Hence, "No".

Similarly, if a = 1 and b = 1, no cutting possible, so "No".

If a = 2 and b = 1, cutting into two 1 × 1 rectangles, which can only form a 1 × 2 or 2 × 1 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation, so "No".

From these observations, it seems that when either a or b is even, there might be a possibility to form a different rectangle, except in some cases like a = 6 and b = 3.

Wait, a = 6 and b = 3: a is even, but output is "No".

So, my earlier thought that if a or b is even, it's possible, might not hold in all cases.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the area.

The area is a × b.

After cutting into two rectangles, the areas of the two pieces add up to a × b.

Then, rearranging them to form a new rectangle with area a × b.

But the problem allows rotating and moving the pieces, so the only restriction is that the new rectangle has integer sides and area a × b.

But the condition is that the new rectangle is different from the original one up to rotation.

So, perhaps the key is to see if there's another pair of integers (c, d) such that c × d = a × b, and c ≠ a and c ≠ b, and d ≠ a and d ≠ b.

Wait, but this isn't always possible.

For example, if a × b is a prime number, then the only possible rectangles are 1 × (a×b) and (a×b) × 1, which would be the same as the original if a or b is 1.

But in the example where a = 1 and b = 1, it's "No", which makes sense.

Wait, a = 1 and b = 1: area is 1, and the only possible rectangle is 1 × 1, so no different rectangle.

Similarly, a = 2 and b = 1: area is 2, possible rectangles are 1 × 2 and 2 × 1, which are the same as the original up to rotation, so "No".

a = 2 and b = 2: area is 4, possible rectangles are 1 × 4, 2 × 2, and 4 × 1.

But 2 × 2 is the original, so to have a different rectangle, we can have 1 × 4 or 4 × 1, which are different from the original, so "Yes".

a = 3 and b = 2: area is 6, possible rectangles are 1 × 6, 2 × 3, 3 × 2, and 6 × 1.

The original is 3 × 2, which is the same as 2 × 3 up to rotation.

So, 1 × 6 and 6 × 1 are different, so "Yes".

a = 2 and b = 6: area is 12, possible rectangles are 1 × 12, 2 × 6, 3 × 4, 4 × 3, 6 × 2, and 12 × 1.

The original is 2 × 6, which is the same as 6 × 2.

So, other possibilities are 1 × 12, 3 × 4, 4 × 3, and 12 × 1.

So, 3 × 4 is different from 2 × 6, so "Yes".

a = 6 and b = 3: area is 18, possible rectangles are 1 × 18, 2 × 9, 3 × 6, 6 × 3, 9 × 2, and 18 × 1.

The original is 6 × 3, which is the same as 3 × 6.

So, other possibilities are 1 × 18, 2 × 9, 9 × 2, and 18 × 1.

But in this case, is there a way to arrange the two pieces to form a 2 × 9 rectangle?

Let's see.

If a = 6 and b = 3:

- Cutting parallel to side a: divide b into b1 and b2, say b1 = 1 and b2 = 2.

- So, two rectangles: 6 × 1 and 6 × 2.

- Rotating them: 6 × 1 becomes 1 × 6, and 6 × 2 becomes 2 × 6.

- Arranging them side by side horizontally: 6 × (1 + 2) = 6 × 3, same as original.

- Arranging them vertically: 1 × 6 and 2 × 6 placed vertically: 6 × 3, same as original.

- Alternatively, placing them side by side horizontally: 1 × 6 and 2 × 6, which don't form a rectangle directly.

- Maybe there's another way to arrange them.

Wait, perhaps arranging them in a different configuration.

If I take the 6 × 1 and 6 × 2 rectangles, rotate one of them, and arrange them differently.

But it seems that any arrangement results in a 6 × 3 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Hence, "No".

So, in this case, even though there are other possible rectangles with area 18, like 2 × 9, it seems impossible to arrange the two pieces to form a 2 × 9 rectangle.

Therefore, the possibility of forming a different rectangle depends not only on the existence of other factor pairs of a × b but also on whether the two pieces can be arranged to form those rectangles.

This seems tricky.

Is there a general condition that allows us to determine this easily?

Let me think about the parity of a and b.

In the program provided, it checks if a or b is even.

If a is even, it cuts a into a1 and a2, both a/2.

Similarly for b.

Then, it checks if a1 != b or b1 != a.

But looking back at the examples, this seems insufficient.

Wait, let's look at the code.

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:

if a % 2 == 0:

(a1, a2) = (a // 2, a // 2)

if a1 != b:

print('Yes')

continue

if b % 2 == 0:

(b1, b2) = (b // 2, b // 2)

if b1 != a:

print('Yes')

continue

print('No')

else:

print('No')

So, the code checks if a or b is even.

If a is even, it cuts a into two equal parts, a1 and a2, both a/2.

Then, it checks if a1 != b.

If yes, prints "Yes".

Similarly, if b is even, it cuts b into two equal parts, b1 and b2, both b/2.

Then, checks if b1 != a.

If yes, prints "Yes".

Otherwise, prints "No".

Wait, this seems too simplistic.

In the case where a = 6 and b = 3:

- a is even, so it cuts a into 3 and 3.

- Then, checks if 3 != 3, which is False, so it proceeds to check b.

- b is odd, so it prints "No".

Which matches the expected output.

In the case where a = 2 and b = 4:

- a is even, cuts a into 1 and 1.

- Checks if 1 != 4, which is True, so prints "Yes".

But earlier, I thought that perhaps in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but according to the problem, the output is "Yes", but according to this condition, a1 = 1, b = 4, 1 != 4, so "Yes".

Similarly, for a = 2 and b = 6:

- a is even, cuts a into 1 and 1.

- Checks if 1 != 6, which is True, so "Yes".

Which matches the expected output.

For a = 3 and b = 2:

- a is odd, so checks b, which is even.

- Cuts b into 1 and 1.

- Checks if 1 != 3, which is True, so "Yes".

Which matches.

For a = 2 and b = 2:

- a is even, cuts a into 1 and 1.

- Checks if 1 != 2, which is True, so "Yes".

Which matches.

For a = 1 and b = 1:

- Both odd, so "No".

Which matches.

For a = 2 and b = 1:

- a is even, cuts a into 1 and 1.

- Checks if 1 != 1, which is False.

- Then checks b, which is odd.

- So, prints "No".

Which matches.

For a = 6 and b = 3:

- a is even, cuts a into 3 and 3.

- Checks if 3 != 3, which is False.

- Then checks b, which is odd.

- So, prints "No".

Which matches.

So, in all the examples, this condition seems to hold.

Is this always correct?

Let me think of another test case.

Suppose a = 4 and b = 2.

- a is even, cuts a into 2 and 2.

- Checks if 2 != 2, which is False.

- Then checks b, which is even.

- Cuts b into 1 and 1.

- Checks if 1 != 4, which is True, so "Yes".

Is this correct?

From a 4×2 rectangle, cutting into two 2×2 squares, which can be arranged to form a 2×4 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Wait, so in this case, the new rectangle is 2×4, which is the same as the original 4×2 up to rotation.

So, actually, it should be "No", but according to this code, it would print "Yes".

Hence, this is an error.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the code, it would first check a, which is even, cuts into 2 and 2, then checks if 2 != 2, which is False, so it proceeds to check b.

b is even, cuts into 1 and 1, checks if 1 != 4, which is True, so prints "Yes".

But according to the problem, it should be "No", because the new rectangle is the same as the original up to rotation.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Another test case: a = 4 and b = 4.

- a is even, cuts into 2 and 2.

- Checks if 2 != 4, which is True, so prints "Yes".

But, from a 4×4 square, cutting into two 2×4 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 2×8 rectangle, which is different from the original 4×4 square.

Hence, "Yes" is correct.

Wait, but according to the earlier mistake, the code seems to give "Yes" correctly in some cases and incorrectly in others.

Wait, in the case of a = 4 and b = 2, perhaps it's possible to cut and arrange to form a different rectangle.

Wait, a 4×2 rectangle can be cut into two 2×2 squares, which can be arranged to form a 2×4 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to cut it.

Let's try cutting parallel to b: divide a into a1 and a2, say a1 = 1 and a2 = 3.

Then, two rectangles: 1×2 and 3×2.

Rotating them: 2×1 and 2×3.

Arranging them side by side horizontally: 2×(1 + 3) = 2×4, same as original.

Arranging them vertically: 1×2 and 3×2 placed vertically: 4×2, same as original.

Seems like no different rectangle can be formed.

Hence, "No" is correct, but the code outputs "Yes".

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, what's the flaw in the code's logic?

The code assumes that if a is even, and a/2 != b, then it's "Yes", otherwise "No".

Similarly, if b is even and b/2 != a, then "Yes".

But as seen in the a=4 and b=2 case, even if a is even and a/2 != b, it doesn't necessarily mean that a different rectangle can be formed.

Hence, the condition is insufficient.

I need a better approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider that to form a different rectangle, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b must be greater than 1.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

For example, a=2 and b=6: GCD is 2, which is greater than 1, and it's "Yes".

a=3 and b=2: GCD is 1, and it's "Yes".

Wait, in the a=3 and b=2 case, GCD is 1, and it's "Yes".

So, GCD being 1 doesn't prevent forming a different rectangle.

Hence, that's not the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a and b share any common factors other than 1.

But in the a=3 and b=2 case, they don't, and it's still "Yes".

Wait, perhaps it's always "Yes" except when a and b are both 1, or when one of them is 1 and the other is greater than 1.

Wait, but in the sample input, a=2 and b=1 gives "No".

a=1 and b=1 gives "No".

a=2 and b=2 gives "Yes".

a=3 and b=2 gives "Yes".

a=2 and b=6 gives "Yes".

a=6 and b=3 gives "No".

So, what's the pattern here?

Looking at the greatest common divisor:

- a=2 and b=6: GCD=2

- a=3 and b=2: GCD=1

- a=2 and b=2: GCD=2

- a=6 and b=3: GCD=3

But "No" is given only for a=1 and b=1, a=2 and b=1, and a=6 and b=3.

Wait, in a=6 and b=3, GCD=3.

But in a=3 and b=2, GCD=1, and it's "Yes".

So, GCD doesn't seem directly relevant.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether a or b is divisible by 2.

But in a=6 and b=3, a is divisible by 2, but output is "No".

Wait, maybe it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2 and whether a/2 or b/2 is equal to the other side.

In a=6 and b=3:

- a is divisible by 2, a/2=3, which equals b.

- So, a/2 = b.

- Hence, "No".

In a=2 and b=6:

- a is divisible by 2, a/2=1, which is not equal to b.

- Hence, "Yes".

In a=3 and b=2:

- b is divisible by 2, b/2=1, which is not equal to a.

- Hence, "Yes".

In a=2 and b=2:

- a is divisible by 2, a/2=1, which is not equal to b.

- Hence, "Yes".

In a=4 and b=2:

- a is divisible by 2, a/2=2, which equals b.

- Hence, "No".

In a=1 and b=1:

- Neither a nor b is divisible by 2.

- Hence, "No".

In a=2 and b=1:

- a is divisible by 2, a/2=1, which equals b.

- Hence, "No".

So, this seems to match all the cases.

Hence, the condition should be:

- If a is even and a/2 != b, then "Yes".

- Else if b is even and b/2 != a, then "Yes".

- Else, "No".

This seems to be the correct condition.

Looking back at the code, it seems to implement this condition.

But earlier, I thought that in the case a=4 and b=2, it should be "No", but according to this condition, it's "No" because a is even and a/2 = 2, which equals b.

Hence, it should print "No", which matches the expected output.

Wait, but earlier I thought that according to the code, it would print "Yes" because b is even and b/2 =1 != a=4.

But in the code, it first checks if a is even and a/2 != b.

In this case, a=4, a/2=2, which equals b=2, so it doesn't print "Yes".

Then it checks if b is even and b/2 != a.

b=2, b/2=1, which is not equal to a=4, so it prints "Yes".

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

So, to fix this, the code should ensure that both conditions are met: either a is even and a/2 != b, or b is even and b/2 != a, then "Yes", else "No".

But in the a=4 and b=2 case, since a is even and a/2 = b, it should be "No", but the code checks b is even and b/2 != a, which is True, so it prints "Yes".

Hence, the code is flawed.

To fix this, the code should ensure that if a is even and a/2 != b, or if b is even and b/2 != a, then "Yes", else "No".

But in the a=4 and b=2 case, a is even and a/2 = b, so it should be "No", but b is even and b/2 != a, so it's "Yes".

Hence, there's an overlap.

So, perhaps the correct condition is:

- If a is even and a/2 != b, or if b is even and b/2 != a, and a != b, then "Yes", else "No".

Wait, but in a=2 and b=2, a is even and a/2=1 != b=2, so it should be "Yes", which is correct.

In a=4 and b=2, a is even and a/2=2 == b, so skip, then b is even and b/2=1 != a=4, so "Yes", but it should be "No".

Hence, still incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition should be:

- If a is even and a/2 != b, and b is not equal to a/2, then "Yes", else if b is even and b/2 != a, and a is not equal to b/2, then "Yes", else "No".

Wait, that seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the key is that after cutting, the two pieces must be able to form a rectangle that is not the same as the original up to rotation.

So, if a is even, cutting it into two a/2 parts, and if a/2 != b, then it's "Yes".

Similarly, if b is even, cutting it into two b/2 parts, and if b/2 != a, then "Yes".

But in the a=4 and b=2 case, a is even and a/2 = b, so it should be "No".

Hence, the condition should be:

- If a is even and a/2 != b, then "Yes".

- Else if b is even and b/2 != a, then "Yes".

- Else, "No".

But in the a=4 and b=2 case, a is even and a/2 = b, so skip, then b is even and b/2 != a, so "Yes", which is incorrect.

Hence, perhaps the condition should be:

- If a is even and a/2 != b, then "Yes".

- Else if b is even and b/2 != a, and a != b/2, then "Yes".

- Else, "No".

Wait, but in the a=4 and b=2 case, a is even and a/2 = b, so skip, then b is even and b/2 != a, but a = 4 and b/2 =1 != a, so "Yes", which is incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that if a is even and a/2 != b, then "Yes", provided that b is not equal to a/2.

Wait, but b is already given, and a/2 != b, so that's already covered.

Similarly for b.

But in the a=4 and b=2 case, a is even and a/2 = b, so it shouldn't be "Yes" in this case.

Hence, perhaps the condition should be:

- If a is even and a/2 != b, and b is not equal to a/2, then "Yes".

- Else if b is even and b/2 != a, and a is not equal to b/2, then "Yes".

- Else, "No".

Wait, but in the a=4 and b=2 case, a is even and a/2 = b, so skip, then b is even and b/2 != a, but a = 4 and b/2 =1 != a, but a == b/2 * 4, which is not relevant.

I'm getting confused.

Perhaps I need to consider that if a is even and a/2 != b, then "Yes", unless b = a/2.

Similarly, if b is even and b/2 != a, then "Yes", unless a = b/2.

Wait, in the a=4 and b=2 case, a is even and a/2 = b, so skip, then b is even and b/2 != a, but a = 4 and b/2 =1 != a, but since a = b * 2, it should be "No".

Hence, perhaps the condition should be:

- If a is even and a/2 != b, and a != b * 2, then "Yes".

- Else if b is even and b/2 != a, and b != a * 2, then "Yes".

- Else, "No".

In the a=4 and b=2 case:

- a is even and a/2 =2 == b, so skip.

- b is even and b/2=1 != a=4, and b=2 != a*2=8, so "Yes", which is incorrect.

Hence, still not correct.

Wait, maybe the condition should be:

- If a is even and a/2 != b, then "Yes".

- Else if b is even and b/2 != a, then "Yes".

- Else, "No".

- But in cases where a = 2 * b or b = 2 * a, it should be "No".

Hence, perhaps:

- If a is even and a/2 != b, and a != b * 2, then "Yes".

- Else if b is even and b/2 != a, and b != a * 2, then "Yes".

- Else, "No".

In the a=4 and b=2 case:

- a is even and a/2 =2 == b, so skip.

- b is even and b/2=1 != a=4, and b=2 != a*2=8, so "Yes", which is incorrect.

Hence, still not correct.

Wait, maybe the condition should be:

- If a is even and a/2 != b, and b != a/2, then "Yes".

- Else if b is even and b/2 != a, and a != b/2, then "Yes".

- Else, "No".

In the a=4 and b=2 case:

- a is even and a/2=2 == b, so skip.

- b is even and b/2=1 != a=4, and a=4 != b/2=1, so "Yes", which is incorrect.

Hence, still incorrect.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to think about the aspect ratio.

If the original rectangle is a × b, and we can form a new rectangle c × d, where c × d = a × b, and c != a and c != b, and d != a and d != b.

But, as I thought earlier, this isn't always possible.

For example, in the a=6 and b=3 case, possible c and d are 1×18, 2×9, 3×6, 6×3, 9×2, 18×1.

But, as we saw earlier, it's impossible to arrange the pieces to form a 2×9 rectangle, so "No".

Hence, perhaps the condition is that a and b share a common factor greater than 1, and a != b.

But in a=6 and b=3, GCD=3, which is greater than 1, and a != b, but output is "No".

Hence, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a and b are both even, or one is even and the other is odd.

But in a=2 and b
