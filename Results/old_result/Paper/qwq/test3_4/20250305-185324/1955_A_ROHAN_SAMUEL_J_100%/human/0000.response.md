Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. The store has two options: buy one yogurt for a burles or buy two yogurts for b burles. I need to figure out the minimum amount of burles he should spend to get exactly n yogurots.

First, I need to understand the promotion. Buying two yogurts for b burles might be cheaper than buying them individually for 2a burles. So, I need to compare b and 2a to see which is better.

Let me think about the cases:

1. If b is less than 2a, then it's better to buy yogurts in pairs using the promotion.

2. If b is greater than or equal to 2a, then it's better to buy them individually.

But there's a twist when n is odd because you can't buy an odd number of yogurts in pairs alone. So, I need to handle that case separately.

Let's consider the example given:

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Output:

9

14

15

20

Let's analyze each test case:

1. n=2, a=5, b=9

- Option 1: Buy two individually: 5*2=10

- Option 2: Buy the promotion: 9

- So, 9 is cheaper.

2. n=3, a=5, b=9

- Option 1: Buy one promotion (2 yogurts for 9) and one individually (5): total 14

- Option 2: Buy all three individually: 5*3=15

- So, 14 is cheaper.

3. n=3, a=5, b=11

- Option 1: Buy one promotion (2 yogurts for 11) and one individually (5): total 16

- Option 2: Buy all three individually: 5*3=15

- So, 15 is cheaper.

Wait, but the output is 15, which matches option 2. But in the note, it says it's more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5. Hmm, maybe I misread. Wait, no, the output is 15, which is buying three individually.

4. n=4, a=5, b=11

- Option 1: Buy two promotions: 11*2=22

- Option 2: Buy four individually: 5*4=20

- So, 20 is cheaper.

Wait, but according to the note, in the fourth test case, you need to buy four yogurts, each for 5 burles, totaling 20. But according to the promotion, two for 11, so two promotions would be 22, which is more than 20. So, it's better to buy individually.

So, from these examples, it seems that when b < 2a, it's better to buy in pairs, otherwise buy individually. But when n is odd, you have to handle it carefully.

Let me think about a general approach.

If b < 2a, then it's better to buy as many pairs as possible, and if n is odd, buy one individually.

If b >= 2a, then it's better to buy all individually.

Wait, but in the third example, b=11, a=5, so b=11 and 2a=10. So, b > 2a. According to this, it's better to buy individually, which matches the output of 15.

In the second example, b=9, a=5, so b=9 and 2a=10. So, b < 2a, so it's better to buy in pairs and individually if n is odd. So, for n=3, buy one pair for 9 and one individually for 5, total 14.

In the first example, n=2, b=9, a=5, b < 2a, so buy one pair for 9.

In the fourth example, n=4, b=11, a=5, b > 2a is false because 11 > 10, so buy individually, total 20.

Wait, but in the fourth example, b=11, a=5, n=4.

If I buy two pairs: 11*2=22

If I buy individually: 5*4=20

So, it's better to buy individually.

So, the general approach seems correct.

Now, looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if n % 2:

if 2 * a < b:

print(a * n)

else:

print(n // 2 * b + a)

elif 2 * a < b:

print(a * n)

else:

print(n // 2 * b)

Let's see if this matches my reasoning.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case, it reads n, a, b.

Then, it checks if n is odd (n % 2):

- If n is odd:

- It checks if 2*a < b:

- If yes, it prints a*n

- Else, it prints (n//2)*b + a

- If n is even:

- It checks if 2*a < b:

- If yes, it prints a*n

- Else, it prints (n//2)*b

Wait a minute, in the odd case, when 2*a < b, it prints a*n, which means buying all individually.

When 2*a >= b, it prints (n//2)*b + a, which is buying as many pairs as possible and one individually.

In the even case:

- If 2*a < b, buy all individually: a*n

- Else, buy in pairs: (n//2)*b

This seems correct.

Let me verify with the examples.

First test case: n=2, a=5, b=9

n is even, 2*a=10 > b=9, so print (2//2)*9 = 1*9=9, which matches the output.

Second test case: n=3, a=5, b=9

n is odd, 2*a=10 > b=9, so print (3//2)*9 + 5 = 1*9 + 5=14, which matches.

Third test case: n=3, a=5, b=11

n is odd, 2*a=10 < b=11, so print a*n=5*3=15, which matches.

Fourth test case: n=4, a=5, b=11

n is even, 2*a=10 < b=11, so print a*n=5*4=20, which matches.

Seems correct.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1, a=10, b=15

n is odd, 2*a=20 > b=15, so print (1//2)*15 + 10 = 0*15 + 10=10

But actually, since n=1, you have to buy individually, so 10 is correct.

Edge case 2: n=1, a=10, b=15

Same as above.

Edge case 3: n=0, but according to the problem, n >=1, so no need to handle n=0.

Edge case 4: n=100, a=1, b=2

n is even, 2*a=2 <= b=2, so buy individually: 1*100=100

But wait, 2*a = b, so it's indifferent. But according to the code, it would buy individually.

But actually, buying in pairs would also cost (100//2)*2=50*2=100, which is the same.

So, it's correct.

Another edge case: n=5, a=3, b=5

n is odd, 2*a=6 > b=5, so buy 2 pairs for 5*2=10 and one individually for 3, total 13.

Alternatively, buy all individually: 3*5=15, which is more expensive.

So, 13 is correct.

Another case: n=4, a=3, b=6

n is even, 2*a=6 == b=6, so it's indifferent. The code buys individually: 3*4=12.

Alternatively, buying two pairs: 6*2=12, same.

So, correct.

Another case: n=3, a=3, b=5

n is odd, 2*a=6 > b=5, so buy one pair for 5 and one individually for 3, total 8.

Alternatively, buy all individually: 3*3=9, which is more.

So, 8 is correct.

Seems like the code handles all these cases correctly.

Therefore, I would say the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
