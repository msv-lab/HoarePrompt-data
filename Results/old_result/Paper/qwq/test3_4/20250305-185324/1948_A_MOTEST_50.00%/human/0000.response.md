Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly n characters are "special." A special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in the string AAABAACC, there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

First, I need to understand what makes a character special. If a character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, that means it's different from the other neighbor. So, in the example, let's look at position 1: A. Its left neighbor is nothing (since it's the first character), and its right neighbor is A. So, it's equal to its right neighbor. But wait, the first character only has a right neighbor, so it's equal to that neighbor. Similarly, position 2: A. Its left neighbor is A and its right neighbor is A, so it's equal to both neighbors, which means it's not special. Position 3: B. Its left neighbor is A and its right neighbor is A, so it's equal to neither or exactly one? Wait, it's equal to neither. So, is it special or not? According to the definition, it's equal to exactly one neighbor. But here, it has two neighbors, and it's equal to neither. So, it's equal to exactly zero neighbors, which is not equal to one. Hence, it's not special. But in the example, position 3 is considered special. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me read the problem again: "exactly one of its neighbors." So, for a character to be special, it must be equal to exactly one neighbor, not zero or two. In position 3: B, left neighbor A, right neighbor A. It's equal to neither neighbor, so zero, which is not exactly one. So, according to this, it shouldn't be special. But the example says it is special. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me look back at the example: "AAABAACC". Positions are 1-based:

1. A (right neighbor A) -> equal to right neighbor.

2. A (left neighbor A, right neighbor B) -> equal to left neighbor, not right.

3. B (left neighbor A, right neighbor A) -> not equal to either.

4. A (left neighbor B, right neighbor A) -> equal to right neighbor.

5. A (left neighbor A, right neighbor C) -> equal to left neighbor.

6. C (left neighbor A, right neighbor C) -> equal to right neighbor.

7. C (left neighbor C, right neighbor nothing) -> equal to left neighbor.

So, positions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 are special (equal to exactly one neighbor), and position 2 and 3 are not. Wait, the problem says positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special. But according to my analysis, position 3 is not special. Maybe I'm miscounting or misunderstanding the example.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a mistake in the example or I'm misreading it. Let's assume the example is correct and try to understand the rule better.

Given that, I need to generate a string where exactly n characters are special as defined above. I need to output "YES" followed by such a string if it exists, or "NO" if it's impossible.

Looking at the code provided:

- It imports os and string.

- Defines a function func().

- Reads the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- Reads n.

- If n == 1, prints 'NO'.

- Else, constructs a string ans:

- If n is even, repeats pairs of the same letter (A,A, B,B, etc.) n/2 times.

- If n is odd, starts with 'AAA' and then appends pairs for (n//2 -1) times.

- Prints 'YES' and the constructed string.

Wait, let's see if this approach is correct.

First, for n=1, it directly prints 'NO'. Is it possible to have a string with exactly one special character? Let's think about it.

Suppose we have a string of length 2: "AA". Then positions:

1. A (right neighbor A) -> equal to right neighbor.

2. A (left neighbor A) -> equal to left neighbor.

So both are special, total 2, which is not 1.

Another try: "AB". Positions:

1. A (right neighbor B) -> not equal.

2. B (left neighbor A) -> not equal.

So no special characters, total 0.

Another try: "AAA". Positions:

1. A (right neighbor A) -> equal.

2. A (left neighbor A, right neighbor A) -> equal to both or none?

Wait, according to the definition, "equal to exactly one neighbor."

In "AAA":

1. A (right neighbor A) -> equal to right neighbor.

2. A (left neighbor A, right neighbor A) -> equal to both.

3. A (left neighbor A) -> equal to left neighbor.

So, positions 1 and 3 are special (equal to exactly one neighbor), position 2 is not (equal to both). Total special characters: 2.

So, it's not possible to have exactly one special character. Hence, for n=1, 'NO' is correct.

For n=2:

Let's see if we can construct a string with exactly 2 special characters.

Option 1: "AA"

As above, positions 1 and 2 are both special, total 2. So, this works.

Option 2: "AABB"

Positions:

1. A (right neighbor A) -> equal.

2. A (left neighbor A, right neighbor B) -> equal to left neighbor.

3. B (left neighbor A, right neighbor B) -> equal to right neighbor.

4. B (left neighbor B) -> equal to left neighbor.

So, positions 1,2,3,4 are all special. Total 4, which is more than 2.

Another option: "ABAB"

Positions:

1. A (right neighbor B) -> not equal.

2. B (left neighbor A, right neighbor A) -> not equal to either.

3. A (left neighbor B, right neighbor B) -> not equal to either.

4. B (left neighbor A) -> not equal.

Total special characters: 0.

Another option: "AABC"

Positions:

1. A (right neighbor A) -> equal.

2. A (left neighbor A, right neighbor B) -> equal to left neighbor.

3. B (left neighbor A, right neighbor C) -> not equal to either.

4. C (left neighbor B) -> not equal.

Special characters: positions 1 and 2. Total 2.

This works.

So, for n=2, "AABC" is a valid string with exactly 2 special characters.

Now, looking back at the code: for n=2, it does n//2 = 1, so ans = 'AA' (assuming x=0, s[0]='A', so 'A' * 2 = 'AA'). Then prints 'YES' and 'AA'.

But according to my earlier analysis, "AA" has 2 special characters, which is correct. So, it seems okay for n=2.

For n=3:

The code starts with 'AAA' and then appends (n//2 -1) pairs. For n=3, n//2=1, so ans='AAA' + '' = 'AAA'.

In 'AAA', positions 1 and 3 are special, total 2, which is not 3. So, this is incorrect.

Wait, according to the code, for odd n, it sets ans='AAA' and then appends (n//2 -1) pairs. For n=3, n//2=1, so appends 0 pairs, so ans='AAA'.

But 'AAA' has 2 special characters, not 3. So, this is incorrect for n=3.

Hence, the program is incorrect for n=3.

But according to the example in the problem, for n=1 it should be 'NO', and for n=2 it should be 'YES' with some string.

Wait, the problem's example is:

Input:

3

6

1

2

Output:

YES

AAABAACC

NO

YES

MM

So, for n=6, it's 'AAABAACC' with 6 special characters.

For n=1, 'NO'

For n=2, 'MM' with 2 special characters.

Wait, 'MM' is "MM". Positions:

1. M (right neighbor M) -> equal.

2. M (left neighbor M) -> equal.

So, both positions are special, total 2. So, it's correct for n=2.

But according to the code, for n=2, it would output 'AA', which also has 2 special characters. So, it's correct for n=2.

For n=3, the code outputs 'AAA', which has 2 special characters, but n=3 is required. So, it's incorrect for n=3.

But according to the problem's example, for n=1 it's 'NO', which is correct, and for n=2 it's 'MM', which is correct, and for n=6 it's 'AAABAACC', which is correct.

But the code doesn't handle n=3 correctly, as it outputs 'AAA' which has 2 special characters, not 3.

So, the program is incorrect because it doesn't handle all possible n correctly.

Alternatively, maybe there is no string for n=3, but the problem's example suggests that for n=1 it's 'NO', but for n=2 and n=6 it's 'YES'.

Wait, but in the code, for n=3, it outputs 'AAA' which is incorrect because it has 2 special characters, not 3.

So, is it possible to have a string with exactly 3 special characters?

Let's try to construct one.

Option 1: "AAAB"

Positions:

1. A (right neighbor A) -> equal.

2. A (left neighbor A, right neighbor A) -> equal to both.

3. A (left neighbor A, right neighbor B) -> equal to left neighbor.

4. B (left neighbor A) -> not equal.

Special characters: positions 1 and 3 (equal to exactly one neighbor). Total 2.

Not 3.

Option 2: "AABBC"

Positions:

1. A (right neighbor A) -> equal.

2. A (left neighbor A, right neighbor B) -> equal to left neighbor.

3. B (left neighbor A, right neighbor B) -> equal to right neighbor.

4. B (left neighbor B, right neighbor C) -> equal to left neighbor.

5. C (left neighbor B) -> not equal.

Special characters: positions 1, 3, and 4. Total 3.

So, "AABBC" has exactly 3 special characters.

But according to the code, for n=3, it outputs 'AAA', which has 2 special characters.

Hence, the code is incorrect for n=3.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
