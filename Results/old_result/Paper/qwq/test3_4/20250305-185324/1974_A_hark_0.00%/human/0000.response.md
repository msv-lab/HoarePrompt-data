Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 5x3=15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: 

- Some take up 1x1 cells, meaning each icon occupies just one cell.

- Others take up 2x2 cells, meaning each icon occupies four cells in a square.

I need to figure out the minimum number of screens required to fit all the icons, given the numbers of each type of application.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. The problem says that each cell can be occupied by no more than one icon, which makes sense because icons can't overlap.

So, for each screen, there are 15 cells available. But, since some icons take up 4 cells, I have to think about how to arrange both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on these screens efficiently to minimize the number of screens used.

Let me think about the screen grid. It's 5 rows by 3 columns. If I try to place a 2x2 icon, it will cover four cells in a square. For example, in the top-left corner, a 2x2 icon would cover cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2).

Given that, I need to see how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen without overlapping, and also how to place the 1x1 icons in the remaining spaces.

Let me try to visualize this. A 5x3 grid:

Row 1: Cells 1,1 | 1,2 | 1,3

Row 2: Cells 2,1 | 2,2 | 2,3

Row 3: Cells 3,1 | 3,2 | 3,3

Row 4: Cells 4,1 | 4,2 | 4,3

Row 5: Cells 5,1 | 5,2 | 5,3

If I place a 2x2 icon in the top-left corner, it covers cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). Then, I have cells (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) left.

That's 11 cells left. Now, can I place another 2x2 icon in the remaining space? Let's see.

If I try to place another 2x2 icon starting at (3,1), it would cover (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2). But wait, cell (3,1) is available, but cell (4,1) is also needed. So, that would leave cells (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).

Now, another 2x2 icon could be placed starting at (3,2), covering (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3). But wait, cell (3,2) is already covered by the previous 2x2 icon if I placed one at (3,1). Hmm, maybe that's not the best arrangement.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a better way to arrange the 2x2 icons to maximize space usage.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total number of cells required and divide by the number of cells per screen, but considering the constraints of placing 2x2 icons.

Wait, but that might not be straightforward because of the way 2x2 icons occupy space and leave leftover cells that might not be usable for other 2x2 icons.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons. Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon takes up 1 cell. So, total cells needed are 4y + x.

Each screen has 15 cells. So, naively, the number of screens required would be ceil((4y + x)/15). But, this doesn't account for the fact that 2x2 icons must be placed in a way that their squares don't overlap and are entirely within the grid.

Given that, I need a better way to model this.

Looking at the grid, it's 5x3. Let's see how many 2x2 icons can fit into this grid without overlapping.

If I place one 2x2 icon in the top-left corner, covering rows 1-2, columns 1-2.

Then, another 2x2 icon can be placed in rows 3-4, columns 1-2.

And another in rows 3-4, columns 2-3.

Wait, but if I place one at (3,1)-(4,2), and another at (3,2)-(4,3), that would overlap at (4,2).

So, I need to ensure they don't overlap.

Alternatively, placing one at (1,1)-(2,2), another at (3,1)-(4,2), and another at (3,2)-(4,3). That would use up rows 1-4, columns 1-3.

Then, there are rows 5, columns 1-3 left.

So, in total, three 2x2 icons per screen, using up 12 cells, leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

Wait, but 3 2x2 icons would use 12 cells, and there are 15 cells per screen, so 3 cells left for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better arrangement.

Wait, let's try to see:

- Place one 2x2 icon at (1,1)-(2,2): covers cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

- Place another at (3,1)-(4,2): covers (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)

- Place another at (4,2)-(5,3): wait, but (4,2) is already covered by the second icon.

Alternatively, place one at (2,2)-(3,3), but let's see:

- First 2x2 at (1,1)-(2,2)

- Second at (2,2)-(3,3)

- Third at (4,1)-(5,2)

But then, cell (2,2) is overlapped, which is not allowed.

So, seems like only two 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping: one at (1,1)-(2,2) and another at (3,1)-(4,2), leaving cells (2,3), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).

Wait, but in this arrangement, two 2x2 icons use 8 cells, and there are 7 cells left.

Alternatively, maybe place one 2x2 icon at (1,1)-(2,2) and another at (3,2)-(4,3), which would use cells (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3), leaving cells (2,3), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).

Wait, but (4,3) is covered by the second 2x2 icon.

So, in this case, two 2x2 icons use 8 cells, and there are 7 cells left for 1x1 icons.

But earlier I thought three 2x2 icons could be placed, using 12 cells, leaving 3 for 1x1 icons. But overlapping is an issue.

Wait, perhaps only two 2x2 icons can be placed per screen without overlapping.

Let me confirm:

- 2x2 icon at (1,1)-(2,2): cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

- 2x2 icon at (3,1)-(4,2): cells (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)

- That's 8 cells used.

- Remaining cells: (2,3), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3): 5 cells.

Alternatively, place the second 2x2 icon at (3,2)-(4,3): cells (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3)

- So, first 2x2 at (1,1)-(2,2), second at (3,2)-(4,3)

- Total cells used: 8

- Remaining cells: (2,3), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3): 5 cells.

Seems like in either arrangement, only two 2x2 icons can be placed per screen.

Wait, but in the first arrangement, with two 2x2 icons, 8 cells are used, and 7 are left.

In the second arrangement, also 8 cells used, 7 left.

But in the initial thought, it was mentioned that three 2x2 icons could be placed, using 12 cells, but that must be overlapping.

So, seems like only two 2x2 icons can be placed per screen without overlapping.

Therefore, per screen:

- 2x2 icons: 2, using 8 cells

- 1x1 icons: up to 7, using 7 cells

Total: 15 cells.

Wait, but in the first arrangement, with two 2x2 icons, there are 7 cells left.

In the second arrangement, same.

So, per screen: 2x2 icons: 2, 1x1 icons: 7.

Alternatively, if fewer 2x2 icons are placed, more 1x1 icons can be placed.

For example, if only one 2x2 icon is placed, using 4 cells, then 11 cells are left for 1x1 icons.

Or, if no 2x2 icons are placed, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, the key is to maximize the number of 2x2 icons placed per screen, which seems to be 2 per screen, leaving space for 7 1x1 icons per screen.

Given that, I need to find the minimal number of screens required to fit all the icons.

So, I need to maximize the use of 2x2 icon placements per screen to minimize the number of screens needed.

Let me think about the algorithm to calculate the minimal number of screens.

Given:

- y: number of 2x2 icons, each using 4 cells

- x: number of 1x1 icons, each using 1 cell

- Each screen can hold up to 2x2 icons and 1x1 icons as per above.

Approach:

1. Calculate how many screens are needed based on the number of 2x2 icons.

2. Then, see how many remaining cells are needed for the 1x1 icons.

3. Determine if additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

Wait, but since placing 2x2 icons affects the available space for 1x1 icons, I need to consider both together.

Let me consider that each screen can take up to 2x2 icons and the remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, for each screen:

- If I place 2x2 icons, each using 4 cells, up to 2 per screen.

- Then, the remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, per screen:

- Option 1: 2x2 icons: 2, 1x1 icons: 7

- Option 2: 2x2 icons: 1, 1x1 icons: 11

- Option 3: 2x2 icons: 0, 1x1 icons: 15

I need to maximize the number of 2x2 icons placed per screen to minimize the total number of screens.

So, first, calculate how many screens are needed just for the 2x2 icons.

Since each screen can take up to 2x2 icons: 2 per screen.

So, the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

But, I also have to consider the 1x1 icons.

Each screen can take up to 7x1 icons if it has 2x2 icons, or 11 if it has 1x2 icon, or 15 if no x2 icons.

To minimize the number of screens, I should maximize the use of screens with 2x2 icons and remaining cells used for 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons: s2 = ceil(y / 2)

- Then, calculate the remaining cells available in these s2 screens for 1x1 icons: remaining_cells = s2 * 7

- If x <= remaining_cells, then s2 screens are sufficient.

- If x > remaining_cells, then need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons.

- The number of additional screens needed: s1 = ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)

- Total screens: s2 + s1

Wait, but this might not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total cells required and the cells provided by each screen.

But, because of the constraints of placing 2x2 icons, it's not straightforward.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

Input:

1 1

Output:

1

Explanation:

Probably, one screen can hold one 2x2 icon and some 1x1 icons.

Wait, input is x=1, y=1.

So, y=1: one 2x2 icon, using 4 cells.

x=1: one 1x1 icon, using 1 cell.

Total cells needed: 4 + 1 = 5.

But, per screen, with two 2x2 icons, it can hold 8 cells for icons, and 7 for 1x1, totaling 15.

But in this case, only one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon, which fits into one screen.

Another test case:

Input:

7 2

Output:

1

So, y=2: two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells.

x=7: seven 1x1 icons, using 7 cells.

Total: 8 + 7 = 15 cells, which fits into one screen.

Another test case:

Input:

12 4

Output:

2

So, y=4: four 2x2 icons, using 16 cells.

x=12: twelve 1x1 icons, using 12 cells.

Total: 16 + 12 = 28 cells.

Each screen provides 15 cells.

So, ceil(28 / 15) = 2 screens.

Wait, but according to the earlier approach:

s2 = ceil(y / 2) = ceil(4 / 2) = 2 screens

remaining_cells = 2 * 7 = 14

x = 12 <= 14? Yes, so total screens = 2.

This matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

0 3

Output:

2

So, y=3: three 2x2 icons, using 12 cells.

x=0: no 1x1 icons.

Each screen can hold two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells.

So, for three 2x2 icons:

- First screen: two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells, leaving 7 cells unused.

- Second screen: one 2x2 icon, using 4 cells, leaving 11 cells unused.

Total screens: 2, which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

1 0

Output:

1

So, x=1, y=0.

One 1x1 icon, which fits into one screen (which can hold up to 15 1x1 icons).

Another test case:

Input:

8 1

Output:

1

So, y=1: one 2x2 icon, using 4 cells.

x=8: eight 1x1 icons, using 8 cells.

Total: 4 + 8 = 12 cells.

One screen can hold up to 15 cells, so it fits.

Another test case:

Input:

0 0

Output:

0

No icons, so no screens needed.

Another test case:

Input:

2 0

Output:

1

Two 1x1 icons, which fit into one screen.

Another test case:

Input:

15 0

Output:

1

Fifteen 1x1 icons, which exactly fill one screen.

Another test case:

Input:

8 2

Output:

2

So, y=2: two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells.

x=8: eight 1x1 icons, using 8 cells.

Total: 8 + 8 = 16 cells.

Each screen can hold 15 cells.

So, ceil(16 / 15) = 2 screens.

Another test case:

Input:

0 9

Output:

5

y=9: nine 2x2 icons, using 36 cells.

x=0: no 1x1 icons.

Each screen can hold two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells, and leave 7 cells unused.

So, number of screens needed for nine 2x2 icons:

ceil(9 / 2) = 5 screens.

Since 5 screens can hold up to 5*2=10 2x2 icons, which is more than enough for nine 2x2 icons.

Hence, 5 screens are needed.

This seems consistent.

So, generalizing from these examples, it seems that the minimal number of screens is the maximum between the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons, considering the overlapping constraints.

Wait, but in some cases, the 1x1 icons can share screens with 2x2 icons, reducing the total number of screens needed.

So, perhaps the minimal number of screens is the maximum of:

- ceil(y / 2)

- ceil(x / 15)

But, in some cases, this might not be accurate because the 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining cells of screens that have 2x2 icons.

For example, in the first test case: y=1 (ceil(1 / 2) = 1), x=1 (ceil(1 / 15) = 1), so max(1,1) = 1, which matches the output.

In the second test case: y=2 (ceil(2 / 2) = 1), x=7 (ceil(7 / 15) = 1), so max(1,1) = 1, which matches.

In the third test case: y=4 (ceil(4 / 2) = 2), x=12 (ceil(12 / 15) = 1), but the output is 2, which matches the maximum of ceil(y / 2) and ceil(x / 15).

Wait, but in this case, ceil(x / 15) = 1, but ceil(y / 2) = 2, so max(2,1) = 2, which matches.

In the fourth test case: y=3 (ceil(3 / 2) = 2), x=0 (ceil(0 / 15) = 0), so max(2,0) = 2, which matches.

In the fifth test case: y=0 (ceil(0 / 2) = 0), x=1 (ceil(1 / 15) = 1), so max(0,1) = 1, which matches.

In the sixth test case: y=1 (ceil(1 / 2) = 1), x=8 (ceil(8 / 15) = 1), so max(1,1) = 1, which matches.

In the seventh test case: y=0 (0 screens), x=0 (0 screens), max(0,0) = 0, which matches.

In the eighth test case: y=0 (0 screens), x=2 (ceil(2 / 15) = 1), so max(0,1) = 1, which matches.

In the ninth test case: y=0 (0 screens), x=15 (ceil(15 / 15) = 1), so max(0,1) = 1, which matches.

In the tenth test case: y=2 (ceil(2 / 2) = 1), x=8 (ceil(8 / 15) = 1), so max(1,1) = 1, but the output is 2. Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the tenth test case: input 8 2 output 2.

According to the earlier approach, ceil(y / 2) = 1, ceil(x / 15) = 1, max(1,1) = 1, but output is 2.

Hmm, that suggests that the approach is incomplete.

So, perhaps considering the maximum of ceil(y / 2) and ceil(x / 15) is not sufficient.

Wait, in the tenth test case: y=2 (two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells), x=8 (eight 1x1 icons, using 8 cells), total 16 cells.

Each screen can hold 15 cells, so 2 screens are needed.

But according to the earlier approach, max(ceil(y / 2), ceil(x / 15)) = max(1,1) = 1, but actual output is 2.

So, that approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach:

Calculate the total cells needed: 4y + x.

Then, divide by the total cells per screen: 15.

Then, ceil((4y + x)/15).

But, in the tenth test case: (4*2 + 8)/15 = (8 + 8)/15 = 16/15 = 1.066... ceil to 2, which matches the output.

Similarly, in the third test case: (4*4 + 12)/15 = (16 + 12)/15 = 28/15 = 1.866... ceil to 2, which matches.

In the fourth test case: (4*3 + 0)/15 = 12/15 = 0.8, ceil to 1, but output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the fourth test case: y=3, x=0.

According to this, (12 + 0)/15 = 12/15 = 0.8, ceil to 1, but output is 2.

That suggests that the approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps because you can't place three 2x2 icons on one screen.

Each screen can only hold two 2x2 icons, as per earlier analysis.

So, for y=3, you need at least ceil(3 / 2) = 2 screens.

Hence, the minimal number of screens is the maximum of ceil(y / 2) and ceil((4y + x)/15).

Wait, in the tenth test case: ceil(y / 2) = ceil(2 / 2) = 1, ceil((8 + 8)/15) = ceil(16/15) = 2, so take the higher value, which is 2.

In the third test case: ceil(4 / 2) = 2, ceil((16 + 12)/15) = ceil(28/15) = 2, so max(2,2) = 2.

In the fourth test case: ceil(3 / 2) = 2, ceil((12 + 0)/15) = ceil(12/15) = 1, so take the higher value, which is 2.

This seems consistent with the outputs.

Hence, the minimal number of screens is the maximum of ceil(y / 2) and ceil((4y + x)/15).

This seems to work for the given test cases.

Let me verify with another example.

Suppose x=15, y=0.

ceil(0 / 2) = 0, ceil(0 + 15)/15) = ceil(15/15) = 1, so max(0,1) = 1, which matches the output for x=15, y=0.

Another example: x=0, y=5.

ceil(5 / 2) = 3, ceil(20 / 15) = 2, so max(3,2) = 3 screens.

Is that correct?

Each screen can hold two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells.

So, for five 2x2 icons, needing three screens (two screens for four icons, and one for the fifth).

Hence, 3 screens, which matches.

So, this approach seems valid.

Therefore, the minimal number of screens is the maximum of ceil(y / 2) and ceil((4y + x)/15).

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

Given that, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

There are three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3.

Func_3 reads the number of test cases and calls func_2 t times.

Func_1 seems to return the minimum of a and b, but it's not used in the code.

Func_2 handles each test case.

In func_2:

- Read x and y.

- If x > 0 and y > 0:

- Calculate bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

- Calculate x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

- Calculate bxsfory1 = ceil(x / 15) + 1 if x > 0 else 0

- Print bxsfory1 + bxsfory

- If x == 0 and y > 0:

- Print ceil(y / 2)

- If x > 0 and y == 0:

- Print ceil(x / 15)

- If x == 0 and y == 0:

- Print 0

Wait, there are a couple of issues here.

First, in the case where x > 0 and y > 0:

- It calculates bxsfory = ceil(y / 2), which is correct.

- Then, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

This seems off. It's subtracting bxsfory * 15 from x and then adding y * 4.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to calculate the remaining x after accounting for the screens used by y.

But, it's subtracting bxsfory * 15, which is the number of screens needed for y times the screen capacity, but adding y * 4.

This seems incorrect.

Moreover, then it calculates bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15) + 1

This also seems off. It should be ceil(x / 15), not ceil(x / 15) + 1.

But according to our earlier reasoning, the minimal number of screens is the maximum of ceil(y / 2) and ceil((4y + x)/15).

So, perhaps there's a better way to implement this.

Let me try to implement the correct logic.

For each test case:

- Read x and y.

- If y == 0 and x == 0:

- Print 0

- Else if y == 0:

- Print ceil(x / 15)

- Else if x == 0:

- Print ceil(y / 2)

- Else:

- screens_for_y = ceil(y / 2)

- total_cells_needed = 4*y + x

- screens_for_total_cells = ceil(total_cells_needed / 15)

- minimal_screens = max(screens_for_y, screens_for_total_cells)

- Print minimal_screens

This seems straightforward.

Now, let's see if the provided code matches this.

In the provided code, for x > 0 and y > 0:

- It calculates bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

- Then, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

This seems incorrect.

It should be calculating the total cells needed and then ceil divide by 15.

Moreover, the expression x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 doesn't make sense.

It seems like a mistake.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of screens required to fit a given number of application icons of two different sizes on a grid-based desktop.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Grid and Icons**:
   - Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns (15 cells).
   - There are two types of icons:
     - 1x1 icons that occupy one cell each.
     - 2x2 icons that occupy four cells each in a square.

2. **Constraints**:
   - Each cell can be occupied by no more than one icon.
   - 2x2 icons cannot overlap and must fit entirely within the grid.

3. **Optimal Placement Strategy**:
   - Each screen can optimally hold two 2x2 icons (using 8 cells) and seven 1x1 icons (using 7 cells).
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of screens required to accommodate all the icons efficiently.

4. **Calculations**:
   - Calculate the number of screens needed solely for the 2x2 icons: `ceil(y / 2)`.
   - Calculate the total cells required for all icons: `4*y + x`.
   - Calculate the number of screens needed to accommodate all icons without considering the type: `ceil((4*y + x)/15)`.
   - The minimum number of screens required is the maximum of the two values calculated above.

## Solution Code

```python
import math

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if y == 0 and x == 0:
            print(0)
        elif y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        elif x == 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        else:
            screens_for_y = math.ceil(y / 2)
            total_cells_needed = 4 * y + x
            screens_for_total_cells = math.ceil(total_cells_needed / 15)
            minimal_screens = max(screens_for_y, screens_for_total_cells)
            print(minimal_screens)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Reading Input**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read the values of `x` (1x1 icons) and `y` (2x2 icons).

- **Handling Special Cases**:
  - If both `x` and `y` are zero, print 0 as no screens are needed.
  - If only `x` is greater than zero, calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons: `ceil(x / 15)`.
  - If only `y` is greater than zero, calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons: `ceil(y / 2)`.

- **General Case**:
  - Calculate the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons: `ceil(y / 2)`.
  - Calculate the total cells needed for all icons: `4*y + x`.
  - Determine the number of screens needed to accommodate all cells: `ceil((4*y + x)/15)`.
  - The minimum number of screens required is the maximum of the above two values to ensure both types of icons are properly placed.

This approach ensures that we are using the screens as efficiently as possible, minimizing their number while respecting the constraints of icon sizes and grid布局.
