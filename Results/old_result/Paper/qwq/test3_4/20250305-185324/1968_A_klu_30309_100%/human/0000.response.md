Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, and y is at least 1. The goal is to maximize the sum of y and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y. Among all possible y values that satisfy this condition, I can choose any one that achieves this maximum sum.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. For example, GCD of 6 and 4 is 2, as you mentioned.

So, for a given x, I need to look at all y values from 1 to x-1, calculate y + GCD(x, y), and find the y that gives me the highest sum.

Let's consider the example you provided:

Input:

7

10

7

21

100

2

1000

6

Output:

5

6

18

98

1

750

3

Looking at the first test case, x=10, and the corresponding y is 5. Let's verify that:

GCD(10,5) = 5, so sum = 5 + 5 = 10.

Is there any y less than 10 that gives a higher sum?

Let's check y=6: GCD(10,6)=2, sum=6+2=8, which is less than 10.

y=7: GCD(10,7)=1, sum=7+1=8.

y=8: GCD(10,8)=2, sum=8+2=10.

y=9: GCD(10,9)=1, sum=9+1=10.

So, y=5, y=8, and y=9 all give the same sum of 10, which is the maximum possible. The example chooses y=5, which is fine since any of these is acceptable.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6: GCD(7,6)=1, sum=6+1=7.

Checking other y values:

y=1: GCD(7,1)=1, sum=1+1=2

y=2: GCD(7,2)=1, sum=2+1=3

y=3: GCD(7,3)=1, sum=3+1=4

y=4: GCD(7,4)=1, sum=4+1=5

y=5: GCD(7,5)=1, sum=5+1=6

y=6: GCD(7,6)=1, sum=6+1=7

So, y=6 is the best choice here.

For x=21, y=18: GCD(21,18)=3, sum=18+3=21.

Let's check if there's a better y:

y=20: GCD(21,20)=1, sum=20+1=21

y=19: GCD(21,19)=1, sum=19+1=20

y=17: GCD(21,17)=1, sum=17+1=18

y=16: GCD(21,16)=1, sum=16+1=17

y=15: GCD(21,15)=3, sum=15+3=18

y=14: GCD(21,14)=7, sum=14+7=21

y=13: GCD(21,13)=1, sum=13+1=14

y=12: GCD(21,12)=3, sum=12+3=15

y=11: GCD(21,11)=1, sum=11+1=12

y=10: GCD(21,10)=1, sum=10+1=11

y=9: GCD(21,9)=3, sum=9+3=12

y=8: GCD(21,8)=1, sum=8+1=9

y=7: GCD(21,7)=7, sum=7+7=14

y=6: GCD(21,6)=3, sum=6+3=9

y=5: GCD(21,5)=1, sum=5+1=6

y=4: GCD(21,4)=1, sum=4+1=5

y=3: GCD(21,3)=3, sum=3+3=6

y=2: GCD(21,2)=1, sum=2+1=3

y=1: GCD(21,1)=1, sum=1+1=2

So, the maximum sum is 21, achieved by y=14 and y=18, among others. The example chooses y=18, which is fine.

For x=100, y=98: GCD(100,98)=2, sum=98+2=100.

Checking y=99: GCD(100,99)=1, sum=99+1=100

y=95: GCD(100,95)=5, sum=95+5=100

y=90: GCD(100,90)=10, sum=90+10=100

y=80: GCD(100,80)=20, sum=80+20=100

y=70: GCD(100,70)=10, sum=70+10=80

y=60: GCD(100,60)=20, sum=60+20=80

y=50: GCD(100,50)=50, sum=50+50=100

y=40: GCD(100,40)=20, sum=40+20=60

y=30: GCD(100,30)=10, sum=30+10=40

y=20: GCD(100,20)=20, sum=20+20=40

y=10: GCD(100,10)=10, sum=10+10=20

y=5: GCD(100,5)=5, sum=5+5=10

y=2: GCD(100,2)=2, sum=2+2=4

y=1: GCD(100,1)=1, sum=1+1=2

Again, multiple y values achieve the maximum sum of 100. The example chooses y=98, which is acceptable.

For x=2, y=1: GCD(2,1)=1, sum=1+1=2.

There's only one possible y, which is 1, so that's straightforward.

For x=1000, y=750: GCD(1000,750)=250, sum=750+250=1000.

Let's see if there's a better y:

y=999: GCD(1000,999)=1, sum=999+1=1000

y=998: GCD(1000,998)=2, sum=998+2=1000

y=997: GCD(1000,997)=1, sum=997+1=998

y=996: GCD(1000,996)=4, sum=996+4=1000

y=995: GCD(1000,995)=5, sum=995+5=1000

y=994: GCD(1000,994)=2, sum=994+2=996

y=990: GCD(1000,990)=10, sum=990+10=1000

y=980: GCD(1000,980)=20, sum=980+20=1000

y=950: GCD(1000,950)=50, sum=950+50=1000

y=900: GCD(1000,900)=100, sum=900+100=1000

y=800: GCD(1000,800)=200, sum=800+200=1000

y=750: GCD(1000,750)=250, sum=750+250=1000

y=500: GCD(1000,500)=500, sum=500+500=1000

y=250: GCD(1000,250)=250, sum=250+250=500

y=100: GCD(1000,100)=100, sum=100+100=200

y=50: GCD(1000,50)=50, sum=50+50=100

y=20: GCD(1000,20)=20, sum=20+20=40

y=10: GCD(1000,10)=10, sum=10+10=20

y=5: GCD(1000,5)=5, sum=5+5=10

y=2: GCD(1000,2)=2, sum=2+2=4

y=1: GCD(1000,1)=1, sum=1+1=2

Again, multiple y values achieve the maximum sum of 1000. The example chooses y=750, which is fine.

For x=6, y=3: GCD(6,3)=3, sum=3+3=6.

Checking other y values:

y=5: GCD(6,5)=1, sum=5+1=6

y=4: GCD(6,4)=2, sum=4+2=6

y=2: GCD(6,2)=2, sum=2+2=4

y=1: GCD(6,1)=1, sum=1+1=2

So, y=3, y=4, and y=5 all give the sum of 6. The example chooses y=3, which is acceptable.

From these examples, it seems that the maximum possible sum is often x itself, achieved when y is such that y + GCD(x,y) = x.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly finds such a y for each x.

The program reads the number of test cases t, then reads t integers into test_cases, and then calls func_1 with t and test_cases, and prints the results.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(t, test_cases):

results = []

for x in test_cases:

max_sum = 0

best_y = 1

for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):

gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)

current_sum = gcd_val + y

if current_sum > max_sum:

max_sum = current_sum

best_y = y

break

results.append(best_y)

return results

So, for each x, it initializes max_sum to 0 and best_y to 1.

Then, it iterates y from x-1 down to 1, calculates GCD of x and y, computes the sum of y and GCD, and if this sum is greater than the current max_sum, it updates max_sum and best_y to the current y, and breaks out of the loop.

Wait a minute, there's a 'break' inside the loop right after updating best_y. That means it only checks y = x-1, and if y=x-1 gives a sum greater than 0, it sets best_y to y=x-1 and stops, without checking other y values.

This seems incorrect because it doesn't actually check all possible y values to find the one that maximizes y + GCD(x,y). It just checks y=x-1 and if it's better than max_sum=0, it picks that and moves on.

In the earlier examples, we saw that sometimes y=x-1 is the best choice, but sometimes other y values might be better or equal.

For example, in x=10, y=5 is chosen in the example, but according to this program, it would check y=9 first, GCD(10,9)=1, sum=10, which is greater than 0, so it sets best_y=9 and breaks, without checking y=5.

But in the example, y=5 is chosen, which also gives sum=10.

So, in this case, it would still get a correct answer, but for x=7, y=6 gives sum=7, which is the maximum, and the program would check y=6 first, find sum=7 > 0, set best_y=6, and break, which is correct.

For x=21, y=18 is chosen in the example, but according to the program, it would check y=20 first, GCD(21,20)=1, sum=21 > 0, set best_y=20, and break, without checking y=18.

But in the example, y=18 is chosen, which also gives sum=21.

So, in this case, y=20 is also acceptable.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98 is chosen in the example, but the program would check y=99 first, GCD(100,99)=1, sum=100 > 0, set best_y=99, and break, without checking y=98.

Again, y=99 also gives sum=100, which is acceptable.

For x=2, y=1 is the only choice, so it's correct.

For x=1000, y=750 is chosen in the example, but the program would check y=999 first, GCD(1000,999)=1, sum=1000 > 0, set best_y=999, and break, without checking y=750.

But y=999 also gives sum=1000, which is acceptable.

For x=6, y=3 is chosen in the example, but the program would check y=5 first, GCD(6,5)=1, sum=6 > 0, set best_y=5, and break, without checking y=3.

But y=5 also gives sum=6, which is acceptable.

So, in all these cases, the program seems to be producing a correct y, even though it's not checking all possible y values.

The reason it's working is that for these x values, y=x-1 is giving the maximum sum, which happens to be equal to x.

But is this always the case?

Let's consider x=4.

Possible y values:

y=3: GCD(4,3)=1, sum=4

y=2: GCD(4,2)=2, sum=4

y=1: GCD(4,1)=1, sum=2

So, both y=2 and y=3 give sum=4, which is the maximum.

According to the program, it would check y=3 first, find sum=4 > 0, set best_y=3, and break, which is correct.

Another example, x=8.

Possible y values:

y=7: GCD(8,7)=1, sum=8

y=6: GCD(8,6)=2, sum=8

y=5: GCD(8,5)=1, sum=6

y=4: GCD(8,4)=4, sum=8

y=3: GCD(8,3)=1, sum=4

y=2: GCD(8,2)=2, sum=4

y=1: GCD(8,1)=1, sum=2

So, y=4, y=6, y=7 all give sum=8, which is maximum.

The program would check y=7 first, find sum=8 > 0, set best_y=7, and break, which is acceptable.

Wait, but what if x=9?

Possible y values:

y=8: GCD(9,8)=1, sum=9

y=7: GCD(9,7)=1, sum=8

y=6: GCD(9,6)=3, sum=9

y=5: GCD(9,5)=1, sum=6

y=4: GCD(9,4)=1, sum=5

y=3: GCD(9,3)=3, sum=6

y=2: GCD(9,2)=1, sum=3

y=1: GCD(9,1)=1, sum=2

Here, y=6 and y=8 both give sum=9, which is maximum.

The program would check y=8 first, find sum=9 > 0, set best_y=8, and break, which is acceptable.

But what if x=12?

Possible y values:

y=11: GCD(12,11)=1, sum=12

y=10: GCD(12,10)=2, sum=12

y=9: GCD(12,9)=3, sum=12

y=8: GCD(12,8)=4, sum=12

y=7: GCD(12,7)=1, sum=8

y=6: GCD(12,6)=6, sum=12

y=5: GCD(12,5)=1, sum=6

y=4: GCD(12,4)=4, sum=8

y=3: GCD(12,3)=3, sum=6

y=2: GCD(12,2)=2, sum=4

y=1: GCD(12,1)=1, sum=2

Here, multiple y values give sum=12, which is maximum.

The program would check y=11 first, find sum=12 > 0, set best_y=11, and break, which is acceptable.

Wait, but what if x=1?

According to the problem, x is at least 2, so x=1 is not possible.

Another example, x=3.

Possible y values:

y=2: GCD(3,2)=1, sum=3

y=1: GCD(3,1)=1, sum=2

So, y=2 gives sum=3, which is maximum.

The program would check y=2 first, find sum=3 > 0, set best_y=2, and break, which is correct.

Wait, is there any x where y=x-1 does not give the maximum sum?

Let's think about x=15.

Possible y values:

y=14: GCD(15,14)=1, sum=15

y=13: GCD(15,13)=1, sum=14

y=12: GCD(15,12)=3, sum=15

y=11: GCD(15,11)=1, sum=12

y=10: GCD(15,10)=5, sum=15

y=9: GCD(15,9)=3, sum=12

y=8: GCD(15,8)=1, sum=9

y=7: GCD(15,7)=1, sum=8

y=6: GCD(15,6)=3, sum=9

y=5: GCD(15,5)=5, sum=10

y=4: GCD(15,4)=1, sum=5

y=3: GCD(15,3)=3, sum=6

y=2: GCD(15,2)=1, sum=3

y=1: GCD(15,1)=1, sum=2

Here, y=14, y=12, y=10 all give sum=15, which is maximum.

The program would check y=14 first, find sum=15 > 0, set best_y=14, and break, which is acceptable.

Wait, but what if x=14?

Possible y values:

y=13: GCD(14,13)=1, sum=14

y=12: GCD(14,12)=2, sum=14

y=11: GCD(14,11)=1, sum=12

y=10: GCD(14,10)=2, sum=12

y=9: GCD(14,9)=1, sum=10

y=8: GCD(14,8)=2, sum=10

y=7: GCD(14,7)=7, sum=14

y=6: GCD(14,6)=2, sum=8

y=5: GCD(14,5)=1, sum=6

y=4: GCD(14,4)=2, sum=6

y=3: GCD(14,3)=1, sum=4

y=2: GCD(14,2)=2, sum=4

y=1: GCD(14,1)=1, sum=2

Here, y=13, y=12, y=7 give sum=14, which is maximum.

The program would check y=13 first, find sum=14 > 0, set best_y=13, and break, which is acceptable.

Wait, but is there any x where y=x-1 doesn't give the maximum sum?

Let's consider x=8.

From earlier, y=7 gives sum=8, which is maximum.

But y=4 also gives sum=8.

So, y=7 is acceptable.

Similarly, for x=15, y=14 is acceptable.

Wait, I can't find an x where y=x-1 doesn't give the maximum sum.

Is it possible that for all x, y=x-1 gives the maximum sum?

Let's think about x=6.

From earlier, y=5 gives sum=6, which is maximum.

Similarly, for x=10, y=9 gives sum=10, which is maximum.

Wait, but in x=21, y=18 is chosen in the example, but y=20 also gives sum=21, which is maximum.

So, y=18 is acceptable, but y=20 is also acceptable.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98 is chosen, but y=99 also gives sum=100.

So, the program choosing y=99 would still be correct.

Similarly, for x=1000, y=750 is chosen, but y=999 also gives sum=1000.

So, the program choosing y=999 is still correct.

Hence, it seems that the program is correct in choosing y=x-1 in most cases, as y=x-1 often gives the maximum sum.

But is this always the case?

Let's consider x=9.

From earlier, y=6 and y=8 both give sum=9, which is maximum.

The program would choose y=8, which is acceptable.

Another example, x=5.

Possible y values:

y=4: GCD(5,4)=1, sum=5

y=3: GCD(5,3)=1, sum=4

y=2: GCD(5,2)=1, sum=3

y=1: GCD(5,1)=1, sum=2

So, y=4 gives sum=5, which is maximum.

The program would choose y=4, which is correct.

Wait, but in x=5, y=4 is the only y that gives sum=5.

So, in this case, the program choosing y=4 is necessary for correctness.

Hence, in this case, y=x-1 is the only y that gives the maximum sum.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 is the only y that gives sum=7.

Wait, no, in x=7, y=6 gives sum=7, but y=1 to y=5 give lower sums.

So, y=6 is the only y that gives sum=7.

Hence, the program choosing y=6 is necessary for correctness.

Wait, but earlier in x=15, y=14, y=12, y=10 all give sum=15.

The program chooses y=14, which is acceptable.

Similarly, for x=10, y=5, y=8, y=9 all give sum=10.

The program chooses y=9 (or y=8, depending on x).

Hence, it seems that choosing y=x-1 is a safe choice, as it often gives the maximum sum.

But is there any x where y=x-1 does not give the maximum sum?

Wait, perhaps when x is a prime number.

Let's consider x=13.

Possible y values:

y=12: GCD(13,12)=1, sum=13

y=11: GCD(13,11)=1, sum=12

y=10: GCD(13,10)=1, sum=11

y=9: GCD(13,9)=1, sum=10

y=8: GCD(13,8)=1, sum=9

y=7: GCD(13,7)=1, sum=8

y=6: GCD(13,6)=1, sum=7

y=5: GCD(13,5)=1, sum=6

y=4: GCD(13,4)=1, sum=5

y=3: GCD(13,3)=1, sum=4

y=2: GCD(13,2)=1, sum=3

y=1: GCD(13,1)=1, sum=2

Here, y=12 gives sum=13, which is maximum.

Hence, the program choosing y=12 is correct.

Wait, but is there any x where y=x-1 does not give the maximum sum?

Let me think about x=8.

From earlier, y=7 gives sum=8, y=6 gives sum=8, y=4 gives sum=8.

So, y=7 is acceptable.

The program chooses y=7, which is correct.

Wait, but in x=15, y=14 gives sum=15, which is maximum.

Hence, the program choosing y=14 is correct.

Wait, perhaps x=4.

Possible y values:

y=3: GCD(4,3)=1, sum=4

y=2: GCD(4,2)=2, sum=4

y=1: GCD(4,1)=1, sum=2

Here, y=3 and y=2 both give sum=4.

The program chooses y=3, which is correct.

Hence, I can't find an x where y=x-1 does not give the maximum sum.

Perhaps, for all x, y=x-1 gives sum=x, which is the maximum possible.

Wait, why do I think sum=x is the maximum?

Let's see.

For any x, y=x-1 is coprime with x or not?

Wait, x and x-1 are always coprime, because GCD(x, x-1)=1.

Hence, y + GCD(x,y) = (x-1) + 1 = x.

So, for any x, y=x-1 gives sum=x.

Is there any y that can give a sum greater than x?

Let's see.

For y < x, y + GCD(x,y) <= y + x <= 2x - 1.

But since y < x, and GCD(x,y) <= y, so y + GCD(x,y) < x + y <= 2x - 1.

But is there any y where y + GCD(x,y) > x?

Wait, for y < x, y + GCD(x,y) > x would require GCD(x,y) > x - y.

But GCD(x,y) divides both x and y, so GCD(x,y) divides x - y*k for any integer k.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose y < x, and y + GCD(x,y) > x.

Then, GCD(x,y) > x - y.

But since GCD(x,y) divides both x and y, and x - y*k for any k, it must divide x and y.

But x - y is a multiple of GCD(x,y), so GCD(x,y) divides x - y.

Hence, GCD(x,y) >= x - y, assuming x - y is positive, which it is since y < x.

But GCD(x,y) is at least 1, and x - y can be small.

Wait, but in the case where y = x - d, where d divides x, then GCD(x,y) = GCD(x, x - d) = GCD(x,d).

If d divides x, then GCD(x,d) = d.

Hence, y + GCD(x,y) = (x - d) + d = x.

So, in this case, sum is x.

But if d does not divide x, then GCD(x, x - d) = GCD(x,d), which is a divisor of d.

Wait, but GCD(x,d) divides d, but d does not divide x.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about specific examples.

Take x=10.

Possible y values:

y=9: GCD(10,9)=1, sum=10

y=8: GCD(10,8)=2, sum=10

y=7: GCD(10,7)=1, sum=8

y=6: GCD(10,6)=2, sum=8

y=5: GCD(10,5)=5, sum=10

y=4: GCD(10,4)=2, sum=6

y=3: GCD(10,3)=1, sum=4

y=2: GCD(10,2)=2, sum=4

y=1: GCD(10,1)=1, sum=2

Here, y=5 gives sum=10, which is equal to x.

But is there any y where sum > x?

No, in this case, sum cannot exceed x.

Wait, y=5 gives sum=10, which is equal to x=10.

Similarly, in x=7, sum=7.

In x=15, sum=15.

So, it seems that the maximum sum is equal to x.

Hence, any y that is less than x and satisfies y + GCD(x,y) = x is acceptable.

Now, the program chooses y=x-1, which gives y + GCD(x,y) = x -1 +1 = x, since x and x-1 are coprime.

Hence, y=x-1 always gives sum=x, which is the maximum possible.

Therefore, the program is correct in choosing y=x-1 for each x.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

   - Since \( y < x \), the sum \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \) is always less than or equal to \( x \).
   - For \( y = x - 1 \), since \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, their GCD is 1. Thus, \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) = (x - 1) + 1 = x \).
   - Therefore, choosing \( y = x - 1 \) always achieves the sum \( x \), which is the maximum possible sum.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, compute \( y = x - 1 \).
   - This \( y \) guarantees the maximum sum \( x \).

## Solution Code

```python
import math

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = list(map(int, data[1:t+1]))
    for x in test_cases:
        y = x - 1
        print(y)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  1. Read the number of test cases \( t \).
  2. Read the next \( t \) integers, each representing \( x \).
  3. For each \( x \), compute \( y = x - 1 \).
  4. Print \( y \) for each test case.

- **Optimal Choice of \( y \)**:
  - By choosing \( y = x - 1 \), we leverage the fact that consecutive integers are coprime (their GCD is 1).
  - This choice ensures that \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) = x - 1 + 1 = x \), which is the highest possible sum for \( y < x \).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The algorithm runs in \( O(t) \) time, which is efficient given the constraints \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \) and \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \).

This approach guarantees correctness and efficiency by always selecting \( y = x - 1 \), ensuring the sum is maximized for each test case.
