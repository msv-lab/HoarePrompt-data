Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have two firework launchers: one launches every 'a' minutes, and the other every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after launch, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive.

We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible.

Let's consider the launch times:

- Launcher 1: launches at a, 2a, 3a, ..., ta minutes.

- Launcher 2: launches at b, 2b, 3b, ..., sb minutes.

Each firework launched at time t is visible from t to t + m.

I need to find a time when the最多 fireworks are visible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Option 1: Simulate over time, checking how many fireworks are visible at each moment. But since a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, this is not feasible due to time and memory constraints.

Option 2: Calculate the number of fireworks visible at specific times where launches occur or visibility starts or ends.

This seems more promising. I need to consider the times when fireworks are launched or when their visibility ends.

Let me think about the events:

- Launch events: at a, 2a, 3a, ..., and b, 2b, 3b, ...

- End of visibility events: at a + m, 2a + m, 3a + m, ..., and b + m, 2b + m, 3b + m, ...

To find the maximum number of fireworks in the sky, I can consider the timeline and count the number of active fireworks at any given time.

But again, with large values of a, b, and m, I need an efficient way to calculate this without iterating through every possible time.

Let me consider the inclusion of fireworks:

- For launcher 1, the number of fireworks launched before time t is floor(t / a).

- Similarly, for launcher 2, it's floor(t / b).

- The number of fireworks that have ended before time t for launcher 1 is floor((t - m - 1) / a).

- Similarly for launcher 2: floor((t - m - 1) / b).

Therefore, the number of active fireworks at time t is:

floor(t / a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / b)

I need to maximize this expression over all possible t.

Let me simplify this:

floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / b)

Each term floor(t / k) - floor((t - m - 1) / k) represents the number of fireworks from launcher k that are visible at time t.

I need to find t such that this sum is maximized.

I need to find the maximum value of:

[floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a)] + [floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / b)]

Let's analyze floor(t / k) - floor((t - m - 1) / k):

This expression gives the number of multiples of k in the interval [t - m, t].

For example, if t is a multiple of k, then floor(t / k) - floor((t - m - 1) / k) is the number of multiples of k from t - m to t.

Similarly for k.

So, I need to find t where the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t] plus the number of multiples of b in [t - m, t] is maximized.

Let me think about the possible values of this sum.

First, for each launcher, the number of multiples in [t - m, t] can be 0, 1, or more.

But given that a and b can be large, and m can be large, I need a general way to compute this.

Let me consider the possible overlaps.

Case 1: m < a and m < b.

In this case, for any t, the interval [t - m, t] is less than a and b, so at most one firework from each launcher can be visible.

Hence, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2.

Case 2: m >= a and m < b.

Here, m is larger than or equal to a but less than b.

So, for launcher 1, multiple fireworks can be visible in [t - m, t], up to floor(m / a) + 1.

For launcher 2, only one firework can be visible, as m < b.

Hence, the maximum would be floor(m / a) + 1 + 1 = floor(m / a) + 2.

Wait, but this might not be accurate.

Wait, floor(m / a) + 1 is the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t].

Similarly for b.

Wait, no.

Actually, the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t] is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a).

But to maximize, we can consider t being a multiple of a and b to maximize overlaps.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

But this seems complicated.

Looking back at the reference solution:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())

if m < a and m < b:

print(2)

elif m < a and m > b:

print(2 + m // b)

elif m < b and m > a:

print(2 + m // a)

else:

print(m // a + m // b + 2)

So, the reference solution has four cases based on m in relation to a and b.

Let me verify this.

Case 1: m < a and m < b.

In this case, only one firework from each launcher can be visible at any time, so the maximum is 2.

This seems correct as per my earlier thought.

Case 2: m < a and m > b.

Here, m is less than a but greater than b.

So, for launcher 1, only one firework can be visible, since m < a.

For launcher 2, m > b, so floor(m / b) + 1 fireworks can be visible.

Hence, total is 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = 2 + floor(m / b).

Wait, but why +1 for each?

Wait, floor(t / k) - floor((t - m - 1) / k) can be up to floor(m / k) + 1.

But in this case, for launcher 1, m < a, so floor(m / a) = 0, plus 1, so 1 firework.

For launcher 2, floor(m / b) + 1 fireworks.

Hence, total is 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / b) + 2.

So, the reference solution seems correct here.

Similarly, case 3: m < b and m > a.

Similar logic applies.

Case 4: m >= a and m >= b.

Then, floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

But wait, is this always correct?

I need to check if there is any overlap in the fireworks from both launchers that could increase this number further.

Wait, suppose a and b are multiples of each other, or have some relationship that causes more fireworks to be visible simultaneously.

But in general, the maximum should be floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1.

But perhaps there is a better way to calculate this.

Let me consider an example.

Example 1:

Input: 6 7 4

According to the reference solution:

m = 4 < 6 and 4 < 7, so output is 2.

Which matches the first case.

Example 2:

Input: 3 4 10

Here, m = 10 >= 3 and 10 >= 4.

So, output is floor(10 / 3) + floor(10 / 4) + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.

Which matches the sample output.

Example 3:

Input: 7 8 56

m = 56 >= 7 and 56 >= 8.

floor(56 / 7) = 8, floor(56 / 8) = 7, so 8 + 7 + 2 = 17.

Which again matches.

So, the reference solution seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider another example.

Suppose a = 2, b = 3, m = 4.

Then, according to the reference solution:

m >= a and m >= b, so output is floor(4 / 2) + floor(4 / 3) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.

Let's simulate this:

Launcher 1: launches at 2, 4, 6, ...

Fireworks visible from:

2 to 6

4 to 8

6 to 10, etc.

Launcher 2: launches at 3, 6, 9, ...

Fireworks visible from:

3 to 7

6 to 10

9 to 13, etc.

At time t = 6:

Fireworks from launcher 1: launched at 2, 4, 6 (visible from 2-6, 4-8, 6-10)

Fireworks from launcher 2: launched at 3, 6 (visible from 3-7, 6-10)

So, at t=6:

- 2-6: visible

- 4-8: visible

- 6-10: visible

- 3-7: visible

- 6-10: visible

Total unique fireworks visible: those launched at 2, 3, 4, 6.

So, 4 fireworks, but according to the reference solution, it's 5.

Wait, perhaps I missed one.

Wait, launched at 2: visible from 2 to 6

Launched at 4: visible from 4 to 8

Launched at 6: visible from 6 to 10

Launched at 3: visible from 3 to 7

Launched at 6: visible from 6 to 10 (same as above)

So, unique launches: 2, 3, 4, 6.

Hence, 4 fireworks.

But according to the reference solution, it's 5.

So, perhaps the reference solution is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I chose a bad example.

Let me choose a = 1, b = 1, m = 1.

According to the reference solution:

m >= a and m >= b, so output is floor(1 / 1) + floor(1 / 1) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

Sample input has a=1, b=1, m=1, and output is 4.

Let's simulate:

Launcher 1: launches at 1, 2, 3, ...

Fireworks visible from:

1 to 2

2 to 3

3 to 4, etc.

Launcher 2: launches at 1, 2, 3, ...

Fireworks visible from:

1 to 2

2 to 3

3 to 4, etc.

At t=1:

Fireworks from launcher 1: launched at 1 (1-2)

Fireworks from launcher 2: launched at 1 (1-2)

At t=2:

Fireworks from launcher 1: launched at 1 (1-2), 2 (2-3)

Fireworks from launcher 2: launched at 1 (1-2), 2 (2-3)

At t=2, fireworks launched at 1 and 2 from both launchers are visible, but since they are the same times, perhaps it's 4 fireworks in total.

Wait, but in reality, at t=2:

- From launcher 1: fireworks launched at 1 and 2 are visible.

- From launcher 2: fireworks launched at 1 and 2 are visible.

So, total unique fireworks: launches at 1 and 2 from both launchers, totaling 4 fireworks.

Hence, 4 is correct.

Another example: a=1, b=1, m=2.

According to the reference solution: floor(2/1) + floor(2/1) + 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Sample input has a=1, b=1, m=1e18, and output is 2e18 + 2.

Wait, but in my example with m=2, it's 6.

Let's simulate a=1, b=1, m=2.

Launcher 1: launches at 1, 2, 3, ...

Fireworks visible from:

1 to 3

2 to 4

3 to 5, etc.

Launcher 2: same as above.

At t=3:

Fireworks from launcher 1: launched at 1 (1-3), 2 (2-4), 3 (3-5)

Fireworks from launcher 2: launched at 1 (1-3), 2 (2-4), 3 (3-5)

So, total unique fireworks: launches at 1,2,3 from both launchers, totaling 6 fireworks.

Hence, 6 is correct.

So, the reference solution seems correct in this case.

Going back to my earlier example with a=2, b=3, m=4, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let's re-examine.

At t=6:

Fireworks from launcher 1: launched at 2 (2-6), 4 (4-8), 6 (6-10)

Fireworks from launcher 2: launched at 3 (3-7), 6 (6-10)

So, unique launches: 2,3,4,6.

Hence, 4 fireworks.

But according to the reference solution, it's 5.

Wait, perhaps there is an overlap I'm missing.

Wait, maybe at t=6, there are more fireworks visible.

Wait, no, only four unique launches are visible at t=6.

Wait, maybe I need to consider a different time.

Let me consider t=8.

Fireworks from launcher 1: launched at 2 (2-6), 4 (4-8), 6 (6-10)

Fireworks from launcher 2: launched at 3 (3-7), 6 (6-10)

At t=8:

- 2-6: not visible

- 4-8: visible

- 6-10: visible

- 3-7: visible

- 6-10: visible

So, unique launches: 4,6.

Hence, 2 fireworks.

Less than at t=6.

So, t=6 seems to have the maximum.

But according to the reference solution, it's 5.

Perhaps the reference solution is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider a different t.

Let me consider t=7.

Fireworks from launcher 1: launched at 2 (2-6), 4 (4-8), 6 (6-10)

Fireworks from launcher 2: launched at 3 (3-7), 6 (6-10)

At t=7:

- 2-6: not visible

- 4-8: visible

- 6-10: visible

- 3-7: visible

- 6-10: visible

Unique launches: 4,3,6.

Hence, 3 fireworks.

Still less than at t=6.

So, perhaps t=6 is the maximum with 4 fireworks.

But according to the reference solution, it's 5.

This discrepancy suggests that the reference solution might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the reference solution counts overlapping fireworks multiple times.

But in reality, each firework is unique based on its launch time.

Hence, in my earlier example, the maximum is 4, but the reference solution gives 5.

Hence, the reference solution might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there is a better way to calculate the maximum number of unique fireworks visible at any time.

Let me consider the general formula.

The number of fireworks visible at time t is:

number of launches from launcher 1 in [t - m, t] + number of launches from launcher 2 in [t - m, t]

But each launcher's launches are periodic, so the number in [t - m, t] is floor((t - (t - m)) / k) + 1 = floor(m / k) + 1, for each launcher.

But in reality, the overlaps might cause some fireworks to be visible together.

Wait, perhaps the maximum is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2, but only if m >= a and m >= b.

But in my example, m=4, a=2, b=3:

floor(4 / 2) + floor(4 / 3) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.

But in reality, at most 4 fireworks are visible at the same time.

Hence, the reference solution overcounts.

Perhaps the correct formula should be floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 - overlaps.

But calculating overlaps is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 - floor(m / lcm(a, b)), where lcm is the least common multiple of a and b.

But calculating lcm for large a and b is problematic, as lcm(a, b) = a*b / gcd(a, b), and a and b can be up to 10^18, so a*b can be up to 10^36, which is too big for standard data types.

Hence, this approach is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me think differently.

I need to find the time t that maximizes the number of fireworks visible.

Each firework launched by launcher 1 is visible in the interval [launch time, launch time + m].

Similarly for launcher 2.

I need to find t where the sum of the indicators of these intervals is maximized.

This is similar to finding the time when the most intervals overlap.

In general, for interval scheduling, the maximum number of overlapping intervals can be found by sorting the start and end times and sweeping through them.

But again, with large a, b, and m, this is not feasible.

Alternative approach: consider the density of launches.

For launcher 1, the launch rate is 1/a per minute.

For launcher 2, the launch rate is 1/b per minute.

The total launch rate is 1/a + 1/b per minute.

Each firework stays for m + 1 minutes.

Hence, the number of fireworks visible at any time is approximately (1/a + 1/b) * (m + 1).

But this is just an approximation and may not give the exact integer count.

Moreover, it doesn't account for the discrete nature of the launches.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the times when fireworks are launched and when they end.

For launcher 1:

Launch times: a, 2a, 3a, ...

End times: a + m, 2a + m, 3a + m, ...

Similarly for launcher 2: b, 2b, 3b, ... and b + m, 2b + m, 3b + m, ...

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time, I can consider the difference between the number of active fireworks from both launchers.

An active firework is one that has been launched but hasn't yet ended.

This sounds like a problem that can be modeled using difference constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a mathematical function and find its maximum.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: m < a and m < b.

In this case, no two fireworks from the same launcher can be visible at the same time because the launch intervals are larger than m.

Hence, at most one firework from each launcher can be visible, so the maximum is 2.

This matches the reference solution.

Case 2: m < a and m >= b.

Here, from launcher 1, only one firework can be visible at a time, since m < a.

From launcher 2, floor(m / b) + 1 fireworks can be visible.

Hence, total is 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / b) + 2.

Similarly, if m < b and m >= a, then floor(m / a) + 2.

Case 3: m >= a and m >= b.

Here, floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

But in my earlier example with a=2, b=3, m=4:

floor(4 / 2) + floor(4 / 3) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.

But in reality, only 4 fireworks can be visible at the same time.

Hence, the reference solution overcounts in this case.

So, perhaps the formula needs adjustment when m >= a and m >= b.

I need to find a way to account for overlapping fireworks from both launchers.

Let me think about the overlaps.

If a and b are coprime, the overlaps are minimal.

If a and b have a common factor, overlaps occur more frequently.

But this is getting complicated.

An alternative approach: consider that the number of fireworks visible from launcher 1 is floor((t - (t - m -1)) / a) = floor(m / a) + 1.

Similarly for launcher 2.

Hence, total is floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1.

But as seen in the example, this overcounts.

Hence, perhaps I need to subtract the number of overlaps.

The overlaps occur when a firework from launcher 1 and launcher 2 are visible at the same time.

But calculating this seems tricky.

An alternative idea: consider that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is the sum of the maximum number from each launcher, minus the overlaps.

But again, without a clear way to calculate overlaps, this is not helpful.

Perhaps I need to accept that the reference solution is incorrect for some cases and find a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference solution is correct, and my example is wrong.

Let me re-examine the example with a=2, b=3, m=4.

According to the reference solution:

floor(4 / 2) + floor(4 / 3) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.

But in reality, at t=6, only 4 unique fireworks are visible.

Hence, the reference solution is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the reference solution is not always correct.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
