Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this path with n cells, and each cell can be empty '.', have thorns '*', or have a coin '@'. I start at the first cell, which is guaranteed to be empty, and I can move one or two cells at a time, but I can't land on a cell with thorns. If I land on a cell with a coin, I pick it up. My goal is to collect as many coins as possible.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have to find the maximum number of coins I can collect from the start to the end of the path, moving either one or two cells at a time, without landing on thorns.

Let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a path with choices at each step: move one cell or two cells, but only if the destination is not a thorn. I need to maximize the coins collected along the way.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem. Dynamic programming is good for optimization problems where you can break down the problem into overlapping subproblems.

Let me think about defining a DP array. Let's say dp[i] represents the maximum number of coins I can collect up to cell i.

Now, how do I compute dp[i]? I can reach cell i from cell i-1 (by moving one cell) or from cell i-2 (by moving two cells), provided that cell i doesn't have thorns.

So, dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + coins[i], if cell i is not a thorn.

If cell i is a thorn, then dp[i] = 0, because I can't land there.

Wait, but according to the problem, I can't land on thorns, but I can pass over them if I jump over them. For example, if cell i-1 is a thorn, I can't come from i-1 to i, but if cell i-2 is accessible, and i-1 is a thorn, and i is okay, then I can jump from i-2 to i.

So, dp[i] should consider only the paths where the previous steps land on valid cells.

Let me try to formalize this:

- If cell i is '*', then dp[i] = 0, because I can't land there.

- If cell i is '.', then dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])

- If cell i is '@', then dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + 1

And the base cases:

- dp[0] = 1 if s[0] == '@', else 0

- dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 if s[1] == '@' and s[1] != '*', else dp[0]

Wait, n can be 1, so I need to handle small n values carefully.

Let me consider some examples to verify this.

Example 1:

n = 10

s = .@@*@.**@@

From the problem, the output is 3.

Let's see:

Cells: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

       . @ @ * @ . * * @ @

dp[0] = 1 (since s[0] == '@')

dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 = 2 (s[1] == '@')

dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1 = max(2, 1) + 1 = 3

dp[3] = 0 (s[3] == '*')

dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2}) + 1 = max(0, 3) + 1 = 4

dp[5] = max(dp[4], dp[3}) + 0 = max(4, 0) + 0 = 4 (s[5] == '.')

dp[6] = 0 (s[6] == '*')

dp[7] = max(dp[6], dp[5}) = max(0, 4) = 4

dp[8] = max(dp[7], dp[6}) + 1 = max(4, 0) + 1 = 5 (s[8] == '@')

dp[9] = max(dp[8], dp[7}) + 1 = max(5, 4) + 1 = 6

But the expected output is 3, not 6. Hmm, I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps because I can't land on thorns, but I can jump over them.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe I should only consider paths where the intermediate cells are valid landing cells.

So, perhaps dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in possible previous steps) + coins[i], if s[i] != '*'

But maybe it's more accurate to think in terms of possible previous steps.

Let me try to adjust my DP approach.

New approach:

dp[i] = maximum coins collectable up to cell i.

- If s[i] == '*', dp[i] = 0, can't land there.

- Else, dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in possible previous positions) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

Possible previous positions are j where j = i-1 or j = i-2, and s[j] != '*'.

Wait, but in the earlier example, this seems to give dp[9] = 6, but the expected output is 3.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that some paths are blocked by thorns.

Let me try to compute dp step by step for the first example.

n = 10

s = .@@*@.**@@

Indices: 0 to 9

dp[0] = 1 (s[0] == '@')

dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 = 2 (s[1] == '@')

dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0}) + 1 = max(2, 1) + 1 = 3 (s[2] == '@')

dp[3] = 0 (s[3] == '*')

dp[4] = max(dp[2], dp[3}) + 1 = max(3, 0) + 1 = 4 (s[4] == '@')

dp[5] = max(dp[4], dp[3}) + 0 = max(4, 0) + 0 = 4 (s[5] == '.')

dp[6] = 0 (s[6] == '*')

dp[7] = max(dp[5], dp[6}) + 0 = max(4, 0) + 0 = 4 (s[7] == '*')

dp[8] = max(dp[7], dp[6}) + 1 = max(4, 0) + 1 = 5 (s[8] == '@')

dp[9] = max(dp[8], dp[7}) + 1 = max(5, 4) + 1 = 6 (s[9] == '@')

But according to the problem, the output should be 3, not 6. So, my DP approach must be wrong.

Wait, maybe I can't go from dp[7] to dp[9] because dp[7] is a '*', even if I don't land on it, but jump over it.

Wait, no, I can jump over the '*' cell.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that I can't step on '*' cells, but I can jump over them.

So, in the DP approach, when computing dp[i], I should consider only the previous positions that are valid, meaning s[j] != '*'.

In the above calculation, dp[7] = 4, but s[7] == '*', which is invalid. So, maybe I should not consider dp[7] for further steps.

Wait, but I can jump from dp[5] to dp[8], skipping dp[7], because dp[7] is invalid.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the DP to only consider valid previous steps.

Let me try to redefine dp[i]:

dp[i] = maximum coins collectable up to cell i, provided that s[i] != '*'

To compute dp[i]:

- If s[i] == '*', dp[i] = 0

- Else, dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in valid previous positions) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

Valid previous positions j are j = i-1 or j = i-2, provided that s[j] != '*'

Let me recalculate dp for the first example with this adjustment.

n = 10

s = .@@*@.**@@

dp[0] = 1 (s[0] == '@')

dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 = 2 (s[1] == '@')

dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0}) + 1 = max(2, 1) + 1 = 3 (s[2] == '@')

dp[3] = 0 (s[3] == '*')

dp[4] = max(dp[2}) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 (s[4] == '@', can only come from dp[2])

dp[5] = max(dp[4}, dp[2}) + 0 = max(4, 3) + 0 = 4 (s[5] == '.')

dp[6] = 0 (s[6] == '*')

dp[7] = max(dp[5}, dp[4}) but dp[4] is 4 and dp[5] is 4, but s[7] == '*', so dp[7] = 0

Wait, no, s[7] == '*', so dp[7] = 0, can't land there.

dp[8] = max(dp[5}, dp[6}) + 1 = max(4, 0) + 1 = 5 (s[8] == '@')

dp[9] = max(dp[8}, dp[7}) + 1 = max(5, 0) + 1 = 6 (s[9] == '@')

But the expected output is 3, not 6. So, my DP is still incorrect.

What's wrong here? Maybe I need to consider that jumping over a '*' cell is allowed, but I can't step on it.

In the first example, the path is .@@*@.**@@

Indices: 0 to 9

From 0, can go to 1 or 2.

From 1, can go to 2 or 3 (but 3 is '*'), so only 2.

From 2, can go to 3 or 4 (3 is '*', so only 4.

From 4, can go to 5 or 6 (6 is '*'), so only 5.

From 5, can go to 6 or 7 (both '*''), so only cannot go further, but can stay at 5.

Wait, but in DP, I need to consider all possible paths.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in dp[9], I'm considering paths that go through invalid cells.

Wait, maybe I need to track the actual paths and see which ones are valid.

This seems complicated. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the DP definition again.

dp[i] = maximum coins collectable up to cell i, without landing on '*'

To compute dp[i]:

- If s[i] == '*', dp[i] = 0

- Else, dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in valid previous positions) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

Where valid previous positions j are j = i-1 or j = i-2, and s[j] != '*'

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that all previous positions j are valid, meaning s[j] != '*'

Let me try to compute dp again with this in mind.

n = 10

s = .@@*@.**@@

dp[0] = 1 (s[0] == '@')

dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 = 2 (s[1] == '@')

dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0}) + 1 = max(2, 1) + 1 = 3 (s[2] == '@')

dp[3] = 0 (s[3] == '*')

dp[4] = max(dp[2}) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 (s[4] == '@', can only come from dp[2])

dp[5] = max(dp[4}, dp[2}) + 0 = max(4, 3) + 0 = 4 (s[5] == '.')

dp[6] = 0 (s[6] == '*')

dp[7] = max(dp[5}, dp[4}) but s[7] == '*', so dp[7] = 0

dp[8] = max(dp[5}, dp[6}) + 1 = max(4, 0) + 1 = 5 (s[8] == '@')

dp[9] = max(dp[8}, dp[7}) + 1 = max(5, 0) + 1 = 6 (s[9] == '@')

But the expected output is 3, not 6. So, clearly, my DP is miscounting.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that once I jump over a '*' cell, I can't use it as a stepping stone.

Wait, no, I can jump over '*' cells, but I can't land on them.

Maybe I need to model this differently.

Let me consider that from any cell i, I can go to i+1 or i+2, provided that the destination is not '*'.

So, I can model this as a graph where nodes are cells, and edges are moves of 1 or 2 cells, avoiding '*'.

Then, I need to find the path from 0 to n-1 that collects the maximum number of '@'.

This sounds like a graph traversal problem, perhaps solvable with DP.

Wait, that's similar to what I did earlier, but maybe I need to adjust the DP to only consider valid moves.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define a function f(i) = maximum coins collectable from cell 0 to cell i.

Then, f(i) = max(f(j)) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0), for all j such that j = i-1 or j = i-2 and s[j] != '*'

With base cases:

- f(0) = 1 if s[0] == '@', else 0

- f(1) = f(0) + 1 if s[1] == '@' and s[1] != '*', else f(0)

Wait, in the first example, n=10, s=.@@*@.**@@

Let's compute f(9):

f(9) = max(f(7), f(8)) + 1 (since s[9] == '@')

f(8) = max(f(6), f(7)) + 1 (s[8] == '@')

f(7) = max(f(5), f(6)) but s[7] == '*', so f(7) = 0

f(6) = 0 (s[6] == '*')

f(5) = max(f(3), f(4)) + 0 (s[5] == '.')

f(4) = max(f(2), f(3)) + 1 (s[4] == '@')

f(3) = 0 (s[3] == '*')

f(2) = max(f(0), f(1)) + 1 (s[2] == '@')

f(1) = max(f(0)) + 1 (s[1] == '@')

f(0) = 1 (s[0] == '@')

Now, compute step by step:

f(0) = 1

f(1) = f(0) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

f(2) = max(f(0), f(1)) + 1 = max(1, 2) + 1 = 3

f(3) = 0

f(4) = max(f(2), f(3)) + 1 = max(3, 0) + 1 = 4

f(5) = max(f(3), f(4)) + 0 = max(0, 4) + 0 = 4

f(6) = 0

f(7) = 0

f(8) = max(f(6), f(7)) + 1 = max(0, 0) + 1 = 1

f(9) = max(f(7), f(8)) + 1 = max(0, 1) + 1 = 2

Wait, but according to this, f(9) = 2, but the expected output is 3.

Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe I made a mistake in computing f(8).

Wait, f(8) = max(f(6), f(7)) + 1

f(6) = 0, f(7) = 0, so f(8) = 0 + 1 = 1

f(9) = max(f(7), f(8)) + 1 = max(0, 1) + 1 = 2

But the expected output is 3. So, perhaps there's a path that collects 3 coins.

Looking back at the path:

0: . -> 1: @ -> 2: @ -> 4: @ -> 5: . -> 8: @ -> 9: @

Coins collected: @1, @2, @4, @8, @9 → 5 coins, but the expected output is 3.

Wait, no, perhaps there are constraints I'm missing.

Wait, the problem says I can move one or two cells at a time, but I can't land on '*'.

So, in the path above, moving from 2 to 4 is allowed (since 3 is '*'), then from 4 to 5, then from 5 to 8, skipping 6 and 7 (both '*'), then from 8 to 9.

So, coins collected: @1, @2, @4, @8, @9 → 5 coins, but expected is 3.

Wait, maybe I can't collect coins from cells I don't land on.

Wait, no, I collect coins only when I land on them.

Wait, but in this path, I land on 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, collecting @1, @2, @4, @8, @9.

But the expected output is 3, so perhaps I can't collect all of them.

Maybe there's a constraint on the path.

Wait, perhaps I can't visit a cell more than once, but in this case, I'm not.

Wait, maybe the example is different.

Looking back at the first example, the output is 3, but according to my DP, it's giving 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the DP to consider that I can't step on '*' cells, not even as part of a jump.

Wait, no, I can jump over '*' cells.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in dp[i], I'm including paths that go through invalid cells.

Wait, in the first example, maybe the maximum coins collectable is 3, by going through a different path.

Let me try to see:

Start at 0: .

Move to 1: @ → collect @1

Move to 2: @ → collect @2

Move to 4: @ → collect @4

Then, move to 5: .

Then, move to 7: * → invalid

So, can't proceed further. So, coins collected: @1, @2, @4 → 3 coins.

Another path:

Start at 0: .

Move to 2: @ → collect @2

Move to 4: @ → collect @4

Move to 6: * → invalid

So, can't proceed.

Another path:

Start at 0: .

Move to 1: @ → collect @1

Move to 3: * → invalid

So, can't proceed.

Another path:

Start at 0: .

Move to 2: @ → collect @2

Move to 5: .

Move to 7: * → invalid

So, can't proceed.

Another path:

Start at 0: .

Move to 1: @ → collect @1

Move to 3: * → invalid

Another path:

Start at 0: .

Move to 2: @ → collect @2

Move to 5: .

Move to 8: @ → collect @8

Move to 9: @ → collect @9 → total 3 coins

Wait, but in this path, moving from 5 to 8 skips 6 and 7, both '*', which is allowed.

So, coins collected: @2, @8, @9 → 3 coins

Another path:

Start at 0: .

Move to 1: @ → collect @1

Move to 2: @ → collect @2

Move to 4: @ → collect @4

Move to 5: .

Move to 8: @ → collect @8

Move to 9: @ → collect @9 → 5 coins, but this seems invalid because it passes through 6 and 7, which are '*', but I'm not landing on them.

Wait, but according to the problem, I can't land on '*', but I can jump over them.

So, in this path, from 5 to 8, I'm jumping over 6 and 7, which are '*', and landing on 8, which is '@'.

So, why is the expected output 3, not 5?

Wait, perhaps I can't collect coins from cells I don't land on.

Wait, no, I collect coins only when I land on them.

Wait, in the path above, I land on 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, collecting @1, @2, @4, @8, @9.

But maybe some of these steps are invalid.

Wait, perhaps I can't jump over cells in certain ways.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that each jump is exactly one or two cells, without skipping cells in between.

Wait, no, I can jump one or two cells at a time.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the jumps more carefully.

Let me try to think in terms of possible paths.

From 0: .

- Move to 1: @ → collect @1

- Then, move to 2: @ → collect @2

- Then, move to 4: @ → collect @4

- Then, move to 5: .

- Then, move to 7: * → invalid

So, path: 0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 7 → invalid

Coins collected: @1, @2, @4 → 3 coins

Another path:

From 0: .

- Move to 2: @ → collect @2

- Move to 4: @ → collect @4

- Move to 6: * → invalid

So, path: 0 → 2 → 4 → 6 → invalid → can't proceed

Coins collected: @2, @4 → 2 coins

Another path:

From 0: .

- Move to 1: @ → collect @1

- Move to 3: * → invalid

So, can't proceed

Another path:

From 0: .

- Move to 2: @ → collect @2

- Move to 5: .

- Move to 8: @ → collect @8

- Move to 9: @ → collect @9

Coins collected: @2, @8, @9 → 3 coins

Another path:

From 0: .

- Move to 1: @ → collect @1

- Move to 2: @ → collect @2

- Move to 4: @ → collect @4

- Move to 5: .

- Move to 8: @ → collect @8

- Move to 9: @ → collect @9

Coins collected: @1, @2, @4, @8, @9 → 5 coins

But this seems valid, but the expected output is 3, so maybe this path is invalid for some reason.

Wait, perhaps I can't collect coins from cells I don't land on, but in this path, I land on all these cells.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that each move is either one or two cells, without skipping cells in between.

Wait, no, I can jump over cells.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I can't collect coins from cells that are skipped over.

Wait, no, the problem says that I collect coins only when I land on them.

In the path 0 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 8 → 9, I land on 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, collecting coins from 2,4,8,9.

But the expected output is 3, so maybe I can't collect all of them.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint on the maximum coins collectable.

Looking back, maybe in the path 0 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 8 → 9, I'm collecting coins from 2,4,8,9, which is 4 coins, but perhaps one of them is not collectable due to the path constraints.

Wait, maybe I need to choose a path that maximizes the coins, and in this case, the maximum is 3.

Perhaps collecting @2, @8, @9 is possible, but collecting @1, @2, @4, @8, @9 is not allowed because it exceeds some constraint.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, there are no such constraints mentioned.

Wait, maybe I need to find the maximum number of coins collectable in any path from start to end, but perhaps not all coins are collectable due to the movement constraints.

In the first example, the output is 3, so perhaps in the provided path, collecting 4 coins is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some coins are on cells that can't be reached in a single path due to the movement constraints.

In the path 0 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 8 → 9, I collect @2, @4, @8, @9.

But maybe from 5, I can't reach 8 in one or two moves because there are '*' in between.

Wait, no, from 5, I can jump to 7 or 8.

But 7 is '*', so I can't land on it, but I can jump from 5 to 8, skipping 6 and 7.

So, it should be allowed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in dp[9], I'm considering paths that are not actually reachable.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the path is continuous, meaning that I can reach cell 9 from cell 5 via cell 8.

Wait, but in dp[9] = max(dp[7], dp[8}) + 1, and dp[7] = 0, dp[8] = 1, so dp[9] = 1 + 1 = 2.

But according to the path above, I can collect @2, @8, @9, which is 3 coins.

So, perhaps my DP is missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to track the actual path or consider that some cells are not reachable.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider that dp[i] represents the maximum coins collectable up to cell i, considering only valid paths.

To compute dp[i]:

- If s[i] == '*', dp[i] = 0

- Else, dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in previous positions where j = i-1 or j=i-2 and s[j] != '*') + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

Let's try to compute dp again with this definition.

n = 10

s = .@@*@.**@@

dp[0] = 1 (s[0] == '.' and it's the starting point, but s[0] == '.', not '@', so dp[0] = 0?

Wait, s[0] == '.', which is empty, not '@'.

Wait, in the first example, s[0] == '.', not '@'.

Wait, in the first example, s = .@@*@.**@@

So, s[0] == '.', which is empty, not '@', so dp[0] = 0

Wait, in my earlier calculations, I assumed s[0] == '@', but in this example, s[0] == '.'.

Wait, I need to correct this.

Let's re-examine the first example.

n = 10

s = .@@*@.**@@

So, s[0] == '.', which is empty.

dp[0] = 0 (since s[0] != '@')

dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if s[1] == '@' else 0) = 0 + 1 = 1 (s[1] == '@')

dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0}) + 1 = max(1, 0) + 1 = 2

dp[3] = 0 (s[3] == '*')

dp[4] = max(dp[2}) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

dp[5] = max(dp[4}, dp[2}) + 0 = max(3, 2) + 0 = 3

dp[6] = 0 (s[6] == '*')

dp[7] = max(dp[5}, dp[6}) + 0 = max(3, 0) + 0 = 3

dp[8] = max(dp[7}, dp[6}) + 1 = max(3, 0) + 1 = 4

dp[9] = max(dp[8}, dp[7}) + 1 = max(4, 3) + 1 = 5

But the expected output is 3, not 5. So, my DP is still incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that I can actually reach cell 9 from cell 5, considering the '*' cells in between.

In this path, from 5 to 8, I can jump over 6 and 7 (both '*'), which should be allowed, so dp[8] should be dp[5] + 1 (since s[8] == '@'), which is 3 + 1 = 4

Then, dp[9] = dp[8] + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5

But expected is 3, so maybe I'm overcounting.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some coins are collected multiple times in different paths.

Wait, no, I think the issue is that in the path from 0 to 9, I can't collect all these coins.

Looking back, possible paths:

Path 1:

0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 8 → 9

Coins collected: @1, @2, @4, @8, @9 → 5 coins

But perhaps this path is invalid because of the '*' cells in between.

Wait, no, I can jump over '*' cells.

Another path:

0 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 8 → 9

Coins collected: @2, @4, @8, @9 → 4 coins

Another path:

0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 9

Coins collected: @1, @2, @4, @8, @9 → 5 coins

But perhaps some of these moves are invalid.

Wait, from 4 to 8, that's a jump of 4 cells, which is not allowed; I can only move one or two cells at a time.

Ah, that's the issue! I can only move one or two cells at a time.

So, from 4, I can only go to 5 or 6.

From 5, I can go to 6 or 7.

From 6, I can go to 7 or 8.

From 7, I can go to 8 or 9.

From 8, I can go to 9.

So, in this setup, from 4, I can go to 5, then to 6, then to 7, then to 8, then to 9, but 6 and 7 are '*', so that's invalid.

Alternatively, from 4 to 5, then from 5 to 7 is invalid because 7 is '*', so can't go there.

From 5, can go to 6 or 7, both '*', so can't proceed from 5.

Wait, no, from 5, I can go to 6 or 7, but both are '*', so dp[6] = 0, dp[7] = 0

Then, dp[8] = max(dp[6}, dp[7}) + 1 = max(0, 0) + 1 = 1

dp[9] = max(dp[7}, dp[8}) + 1 = max(0, 1) + 1 = 2

So, according to this, dp[9] = 2, but the expected output is 3.

Wait, but earlier I thought the path 0 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 8 → 9 collects @2, @4, @8, @9 → 4 coins, but according to this DP, dp[9] = 2.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the DP to only consider valid previous steps.

Let me try to implement the DP with this logic in code and see.

def Coins(n, s):

    if n == 0:

        return 0

    dp = [0] * n

    if s[0] == '@':

        dp[0] = 1

    else:

        dp[0] = 0

    if n > 1 and s[1] != '*':

        dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if s[1] == '@' else 0)

    else:

        dp[1] = dp[0]

    for i in range(2, n):

        if s[i] != '*':

            previous = [dp[j] for j in [i-1, i-2] if j >= 0 and s[j] != '*']

            if previous:

                dp[i] = max(previous) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

            else:

                dp[i] = 0

        else:

            dp[i] = 0

    return dp[-1]

Let's compute dp for the first example.

n = 10

s = .@@*@.**@@

dp[0] = 0 (s[0] == '.')

dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 = 1 (s[1] == '@')

dp[2] = max(dp[1}, dp[0}) + 1 = max(1, 0) + 1 = 2

dp[3] = 0 (s[3] == '*')

dp[4] = max(dp[2}) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

dp[5] = max(dp[4}, dp[2}) + 0 = max(3, 2) + 0 = 3

dp[6] = 0 (s[6] == '*')

dp[7] = max(dp[5}) + 0 = 3 + 0 = 3

dp[8] = max(dp[7}, dp[6}) + 1 = max(3, 0) + 1 = 4

dp[9] = max(dp[8}, dp[7}) + 1 = max(4, 3) + 1 = 5

But the expected output is 3, so something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to set dp[i] = 0 if s[i] == '*', which I'm already doing, but maybe I need to handle the previous steps more carefully.

Wait, in dp[7], s[7] == '*', so dp[7] = 0

Then, dp[8] = max(dp[6}, dp[7}) + 1 = max(0, 0) + 1 = 1

dp[9] = max(dp[8}, dp[7}) + 1 = max(1, 0) + 1 = 2

So, dp[9] = 2, which is still not matching the expected output of 3.

Wait, perhaps the expected output is 3 because the maximum collectable coins is @1, @2, @4 → 3 coins.

Another path: @2, @4, @8, @9 → but can't reach @8 and @9 from @4 due to '*' cells in between.

Wait, from 4, I can only go to 5, then from 5 to 6 or 7, both '*', so can't proceed further.

So, from 4, I can't reach 8 or 9.

So, the maximum collectable coins would be @1, @2, @4 → 3 coins.

Another path: @2, @4, then can't proceed further → 2 coins.

Another path: @1, @2, then can't proceed to 4 or elsewhere without hitting '*' → 2 coins.

Another path: @2, @8, @9 → but to reach 8 from 2, I need to go through 4, 5, which leads to '*' cells.

Wait, no, from 2 to 4, then 5, but 5 to 6 or 7, both '*', so can't reach 8.

So, perhaps the only possible paths are:

- 0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → stop → collect @1, @2, @4 → 3 coins

- 0 → 2 → 4 → stop → collect @2, @4 → 2 coins

- 0 → 1 → 2 → stop → collect @1, @2 → 2 coins

- 0 → 2 → stop → collect @2 → 1 coin

- 0 → 1 → stop → collect @1 → 1 coin

- 0 → stop → collect nothing → 0 coins

So, the maximum collectable coins is 3.

Therefore, the expected output is 3, but according to my DP, dp[9] = 2.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the DP to only consider paths that are actually reachable.

In other words, dp[i] should only be updated if there is a valid path from start to i.

In the above DP, dp[8] and dp[9] are being updated even if the path is not reachable from start.

Let me check if from start I can reach cell 8 or 9.

From 0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 7 → can't proceed

From 0 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 7 → can't proceed

From 0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → can't proceed further

So, from start, I can't reach cells 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Hence, the maximum collectable coins are from cells 0,1,2,4, which have @1, @2, @4 → 3 coins.

So, dp[4] = 3, but dp[5] onwards should be 0, since they are not reachable from start without passing through '*' cells.

Hence, the correct dp should be:

dp[0] = 0 (s[0] == '.')

dp[1] = 1 (s[1] == '@')

dp[2] = 2 (s[2] == '@')

dp[3] = 0 (s[3] == '*')

dp[4] = 3 (s[4] == '@')

dp[5] = 0 (not reachable from start without passing through '*' cells)

dp[6] = 0 (s[6] == '*')

dp[7] = 0 (s[7] == '*')

dp[8] = 0 (not reachable from start)

dp[9] = 0 (not reachable from start)

Hence, the maximum coins collectable is dp[4] = 3.

So, in the DP approach, I need to ensure that dp[i] is only updated if there is a valid path from start to i.

In other words, dp[i] should only be updated if there exists a j in [i-2, i-1] where s[j] != '*' and dp[j] > 0.

Let me adjust the DP accordingly.

def Coins(n, s):

    if n == 0:

        return 0

    dp = [0] * n

    if s[0] == '@':

        dp[0] = 1

    else:

        dp[0] = 0

    if n > 1 and s[1] != '*':

        dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if s[1] == '@' else 0)

    else:

        dp[1] = dp[0]

    for i in range(2, n):

        previous = [dp[j] for j in [i-1, i-2] if j >= 0 and s[j] != '*']

        if previous:

            dp[i] = max(previous) + (1 if s[i] == '@' else 0)

        else:

            dp[i] = 0

    return max(dp)

In this adjusted DP, dp[i] is only updated if there is at least one valid previous position j from which I can reach i.

Let's compute dp for the first example.

n = 10

s = .@@*@.**@@

dp[0] = 0

dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 = 1

dp[2] = max(dp[1}, dp[0}) + 1 = max(1, 0) + 1 = 2

dp[3] = 0 (s[3] == '*')

dp[4] = max(dp[2}) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

dp[5] = max(dp[4}, dp[2}) + 0 = max(3, 2) + 0 = 3

dp[6] = 0 (s[6] == '*')

dp[7] = max(dp[5}) + 0 = 3 + 0 = 3

dp[8] = max(dp[7}, dp[6}) + 1 = max(3, 0) + 1 = 4

dp[9] = max(dp[8}, dp[7}) + 1 = max(4, 3) + 1 = 5

But according to the earlier reasoning, dp[5] onwards should be 0, but in this DP,
