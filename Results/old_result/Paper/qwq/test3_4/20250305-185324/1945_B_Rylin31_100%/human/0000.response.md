Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals: the first one every 'a' minutes and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework stays in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive, where x is the launch time.

The question is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible.

Let's consider the launch times:

- For the first installation, fireworks are launched at times: a, 2a, 3a, and so on.

- For the second installation, fireworks are launched at times: b, 2b, 3b, and so on.

Each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes after launch, so for a firework launched at time t, it's visible from t to t + m inclusive.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible in the sky.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the visibility periods of the fireworks and find the time when the most of these periods overlap.

But with large values of a, b, and m (up to 10^18), I need an efficient way to calculate this without simulating every possible time.

Let me consider the frequency of launches and the duration of visibility.

For the first installation, the number of fireworks launched up to time t is floor(t / a). Similarly, for the second installation, it's floor(t / b).

Each of these fireworks has a visibility period of m + 1 minutes.

But overlapping these periods isn't straightforward because of the way they are launched at regular intervals.

Wait, the problem says that if one firework was launched m minutes after another, both will be visible for one minute. So, there is some overlap based on the launch times and the visibility duration.

I need to find a time t where the number of fireworks from both installations that are visible at t is maximized.

Let me think about the possible scenarios.

Scenario 1: a and b are multiples of each other.

In this case, the launch times of one installation are a subset of the other's launch times.

For example, if a = 2 and b = 4, then the launch times of the second installation are also launch times of the first installation.

In such cases, the maximum number of visible fireworks would be higher compared to when a and b are co-prime.

Wait, but I need a general solution that works for any a, b, and m.

Scenario 2: a and b are co-prime.

In this case, their launch times don't coincide except at multiples of their least common multiple, which is a * b.

But I need to consider the visibility periods overlapping.

Let me try to find a formula or a method to calculate the maximum number of visible fireworks.

I recall that in similar problems involving periodic events and their overlaps, the Chinese Remainder Theorem or properties of least common multiples (LCM) and greatest common divisors (GCD) are useful.

Let me consider the LCM of a and b, denoted as LCM(a, b).

The LCM(a, b) is the smallest time at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.

But I'm not sure if focusing on LCM directly helps here.

Maybe I should think about the density of launch times.

The first installation launches every a minutes, so in any time interval of length t, the number of launches is floor(t / a).

Similarly, the second installation launches floor(t / b) times.

But since the visibility of each firework lasts m + 1 minutes, each launch contributes to m + 1 minutes of visibility.

However, because launches are periodic, their visibility periods overlap in a pattern depending on a, b, and m.

This seems complicated. Let's look at the example provided.

In the first example:

a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

According to the explanation, at t = 7 minutes, two fireworks are visible: one from the first installation launched at t = 6 and one from the second installation launched at t = 7.

Since m = 4, the firework launched at t = 6 is visible from t = 6 to t = 10, and the one launched at t = 7 is visible from t = 7 to t = 11.

At t = 7, both are visible, so the maximum is 2.

In the third example:

a = 7, b = 8, m = 56

At t = 112 minutes, there are 17 fireworks visible.

I need to see how this number is calculated.

Let's see, for the first installation:

Launch times: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, ...

Each firework is visible from t to t + 56.

Similarly, for the second installation:

Launch times: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, ...

Each firework is visible from t to t + 56.

At t = 112:

Fireworks from first installation launched at:

112 - 56 = 56 to 112

So, launches from t = 56 to t = 112, with launches every 7 minutes.

From t = 56 to t = 112, inclusive.

Number of launches in this interval: floor(112 / 7) - floor((56 - 1) / 7) = 16 - 7 = 9

Wait, but the explanation says 9 fireworks from the first installation.

Wait, 56 / 7 = 8, 112 / 7 = 16, so launches at t = 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 => 9 fireworks.

Similarly, for the second installation:

Launches from t = 56 to t = 112, every 8 minutes.

56 / 8 = 7, 112 / 8 = 14, so launches at t = 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 => 8 fireworks.

Total visible at t = 112: 9 + 8 = 17 fireworks.

This matches the example.

So, in general, at any time t, the number of visible fireworks is the number of launches from the first installation that are within [t - m, t] plus the number of launches from the second installation that are within [t - m, t].

In other words, for the first installation, the number of launches in [t - m, t] is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for the second installation: floor((t)/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

So, the total visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to maximize this expression over all possible t.

Given that a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to compute this without iterating over all possible t.

I need to find the value of t that maximizes the above expression.

Let me consider that for large t, the expression floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) stabilizes to m / a + 1, similarly for b.

Wait, let's see.

Consider t much larger than m.

Then, floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) is approximately (t/a - floor(t/a)) - (t/a - m/a - 1/a - floor((t - m - 1)/a))

Wait, this seems messy.

Alternatively, consider that floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) is equal to floor((t - (t - m - 1)) / a) = floor((m + 1)/a)

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Actually, the difference floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) can be calculated based on how many multiples of a are in the interval [t - m, t].

It's equal to floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Which is equal to the number of multiples of a in [t - m + 1, t]

Similarly for b.

So, the total visible fireworks at time t is:

number of multiples of a in [t - m + 1, t] plus number of multiples of b in [t - m + 1, t]

I need to maximize this sum.

Now, to maximize this, I need to choose t such that both [t - m + 1, t] contains as many multiples of a and b as possible.

I need to maximize the sum of floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b)

Wait, actually, in the earlier step, I had floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a), which is equivalent to the number of multiples of a in [t - m + 1, t]

Similarly for b.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to choose t such that both [t - m + 1, t] contain as many multiples of a and b as possible.

To maximize the number of multiples of a in [t - m + 1, t], t should be aligned with multiples of a.

Similarly for b.

Ideally, t should be a multiple of both a and b to maximize both counts.

But, depending on m, it might not be possible to cover many multiples of both a and b simultaneously.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

If I set t to be a multiple of LCM(a, b), then both installations launch simultaneously at t, t + LCM(a, b), etc.

But I need to consider the visibility period m.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider t such that t is congruent to some value modulo LCM(a, b).

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix t, and I want to compute the number of visible fireworks.

As mentioned earlier, it's floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b)

I need to maximize this expression.

I need to find t such that both floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) and floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b) are maximized.

Let's consider floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a)

This represents the number of multiples of a in the interval [t - m + 1, t]

Similarly for b.

The maximum value of floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) is floor(m / a) + 1, which occurs when t is a multiple of a.

Similarly, floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b) can be up to floor(m / b) + 1 when t is a multiple of b.

If a and b are co-prime, then perhaps the maximum sum is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

But in the first example, a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

floor(4 / 6) + floor(4 / 7) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches the first example.

In the third example, a = 7, b = 8, m = 56

floor(56 / 7) + floor(56 / 8) + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches the third example.

Similarly, in the second example, a = 3, b = 4, m = 10

floor(10 / 3) + floor(10 / 4) + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which should match the second example.

Seems consistent.

So, perhaps the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

But wait, in the first example, it's floor(4 / 6) + floor(4 / 7) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which is correct.

In the third example, floor(56 / 7) + floor(56 / 8) + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches.

In the fifth example, a = 1, b = 1, m = 1

floor(1 / 1) + floor(1 / 1) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which should match the fifth example's output.

In the sixth example, a = 1, b = 1, m = 1000000000000000000

floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) + floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) + 2 = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sixth example.

Seems like this formula works.

But let's verify with another test case.

Suppose a = 2, b = 3, m = 5

Then, floor(5 / 2) + floor(5 / 3) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

Is this possible?

Let's see:

Launch times for a = 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...

Visibility: from t to t + 5

Similarly for b = 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, ...

At t = 6:

Fireworks from a launched at 2, 4, 6 are visible at t = 6 (since 2 + 5 = 7 >= 6, 4 + 5 = 9 >=6, 6 + 5 =11 >=6)

Fireworks from b launched at 3, 6 are visible at t=6 (3 +5=8 >=6, 6+5=11>=6)

So total visible at t=6: 3 (from a) + 2 (from b) = 5, which matches the formula.

Another test case: a=5, b=5, m=10

floor(10 /5 ) + floor(10 /5 ) + 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 =6

At t=10:

From a: launches at 5,10 are visible (5+10=15 >=10, 10+10=20 >=10)

From b: launches at 5,10 are visible

Total: 2 + 2 =4, but according to the formula, it's 6.

Wait, this contradicts the formula.

So, perhaps the formula is not always correct.

What's happening here?

Wait, in this case, a = b =5, m=10

At t=10, fireworks from both installations launched at t=5 and t=10 are visible.

So, total visible: 2 (from a) + 2 (from b) =4

But according to the formula: floor(10/5) + floor(10/5) +2 =2 +2 +2=6

This discrepancy suggests that the formula overcounts when a and b are not co-prime.

In this case, a and b are equal, so their launches coincide.

I need to adjust the formula to account for overlapping launches.

In other words, when both installations launch at the same time, their fireworks are counted separately, but the number of unique launches needs to be considered.

Wait, in the initial approach, I assumed that the maximum is floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) +2

But when a and b have common multiples, the formula overcounts the overlapping launches.

So, perhaps I need to subtract the overlapping launches.

Let me consider the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Total visible fireworks = number from a + number from b - number from both.

But in the earlier example, a=5, b=5, m=10

Number from a: floor(10/5) +1 =3

Number from b: floor(10/5) +1 =3

Number from both: floor(10/LCM(5,5)) +1 = floor(10/5) +1 =3

So, total visible: 3 + 3 -3 =3, but in reality, it's 4.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the number of visible fireworks from a is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

Similarly for b.

And the overlapping launches are those where t is a multiple of LCM(a,b).

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for each installation, the number of visible fireworks at time t is floor(m / a) +1, provided that t is aligned with the launch times.

Similarly for b.

Then, the total would be floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1 - overlap.

The overlap would be the number of launches that coincide, which is floor(m / LCM(a,b)) +1.

But in the earlier example with a=5, b=5, m=10

floor(10 /5 ) +1 + floor(10 /5 ) +1 - floor(10 /5 ) +1 =2 +2 +2 -2 +1=3, but in reality, it's 4.

Still not matching.

I need to find a better way to account for overlapping launches.

Perhaps I should consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

Let me recall that LCM(a,b) = a * b / GCD(a,b)

Maybe inclusion-exclusion based on GCD can help.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think about the general case where a and b are any positive integers.

I need to maximize floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b)

I need to find t such that this sum is maximized.

I need to find t where both floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) and floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b) are maximized.

Each of these terms is maximized when t is a multiple of a and b, respectively.

So, if I set t to be a multiple of both a and b, i.e., t is a multiple of LCM(a,b), then both terms are maximized.

In that case, floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) = floor(m / a) +1

Similarly for b.

So, total would be floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1

But in the earlier example where a=b=5 and m=10, this would be floor(10/5)+1 + floor(10/5)+1 =2+1 +2+1=6, but in reality, it's 4.

So, this overcounts when a and b have common multiples.

I need to adjust for the overlapping launches.

Perhaps I need to subtract the number of overlapping launches.

The number of overlapping launches in the interval [t - m +1, t] is floor(m / LCM(a,b)) +1

So, the total visible fireworks would be:

floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1 - (floor(m / LCM(a,b)) +1)

Which simplifies to floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) +1 - floor(m / LCM(a,b))

In the earlier example, a=b=5, m=10

floor(10/5) + floor(10/5) +1 - floor(10/5) =2 +2 +1 -2=3, but in reality, it's 4.

Still not matching.

I must be missing something.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix t, and I want to compute the number of visible fireworks from a and b.

From a: floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/ a)

Similarly for b.

I need to maximize the sum.

I need to choose t such that both floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/ a) and floor(t / b) - floor((t - m -1)/ b) are maximized.

I know that floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/ a) is equal to floor((t - (t - m -1)) / a) + something.

Wait, I recall that floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/ a) is equal to floor((t - (t - m -1)) / a) = floor((m +1)/ a)

Wait, no.

Actually, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/ a) can be equal to the number of multiples of a in [t - m +1, t], which is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/ a)

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look up the formula for the number of multiples of a in an interval.

The number of multiples of a in [l, r] is floor(r / a) - floor((l -1)/ a)

So, for [t - m +1, t], the number of multiples of a is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/ a)

Similarly for b.

So, the total visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/ a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m)/ b)

I need to maximize this sum.

I need to choose t such that this sum is maximized.

Now, I need to find the maximum value of floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/ a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m)/ b)

I need a way to compute this efficiently for large values of a, b, and m.

Given that a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, I need an O(1) solution.

Let me consider that for t >= m, the expression floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/ a) is equal to floor(m / a) +1 if t is a multiple of a, else floor(m / a)

Similarly for b.

Wait, let's see.

If t is a multiple of a, then floor(t / a) = t / a

And floor((t - m)/ a) = floor((t / a) - m / a) = floor(t / a) - ceil(m / a)

Wait, no.

Actually, floor((t - m)/ a) = floor((t / a) - m / a)

If t is a multiple of a, then t / a is integer, say k.

So, floor(k - m / a) = k - ceil(m / a)

Therefore, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/ a) = k - (k - ceil(m / a)) = ceil(m / a)

Wait, but ceil(m / a) = floor(m / a) + 1 if m % a !=0, else floor(m / a)

So, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/ a) = ceil(m / a)

Similarly, floor(t / b) - floor((t - m)/ b) = ceil(m / b)

Therefore, the sum is ceil(m / a) + ceil(m / b)

Similarly, if t is not a multiple of a and b, the expression would be floor(m / a) + floor(m / b)

So, the maximum should be ceil(m / a) + ceil(m / b)

But in the earlier example where a=5, b=5, m=10

ceil(10 /5 ) + ceil(10 /5 ) =2 +2=4, which matches the actual count.

In the first example, a=6, b=7, m=4

ceil(4 /6 ) + ceil(4 /7 ) =1 +1=2, which matches.

In the third example, a=7, b=8, m=56

ceil(56 /7 ) + ceil(56 /8 ) =8 +7=15, but in the explanation, it's 17.

Wait, discrepancy here.

In the third example, according to the explanation, at t=112, there are 9 from a and 8 from b, total 17.

But according to ceil(m / a) + ceil(m / b), it's 8 +7=15, but actual is 17.

So, perhaps I need to consider something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that t can be larger than m, and the number of visible fireworks can be higher.

Wait, but m is the visibility period.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when t is a multiple of a and b, the number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1 - overlaps.

But in the third example, floor(56 /7 ) +1 + floor(56 /8 ) +1 - floor(56 / LCM(7,8)) +1 =8 +1 +7 +1 - floor(56 /56) +1=8+1+7+1-1+1=17

Which matches the explanation.

So, perhaps the general formula is:

floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1 - floor(m / LCM(a,b)) +1

Simplify: floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 3 - floor(m / LCM(a,b))

In the third example, 8 +7 +3 -1=17, which matches.

In the first example, floor(4 /6 ) + floor(4 /7 ) +3 - floor(4 / LCM(6,7))=0 +0 +3 -0=3, but in reality, it's 2.

Discrepancy again.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me think differently.

I need to find the maximum number of visible fireworks, which is the sum of the number of launches from a and b that are visible at time t.

Each installation's visible launches are floor(m / a) +1 if t is a multiple of a, else floor(m / a)

Similarly for b.

So, the maximum sum would be (floor(m / a) +1) + (floor(m / b) +1) - overlap

Where overlap is the number of launches that are counted twice, i.e., when t is a multiple of both a and b.

So, overlap would be floor(m / LCM(a,b)) +1 if t is a multiple of LCM(a,b), else floor(m / LCM(a,b))

Therefore, the maximum is (floor(m / a) +1) + (floor(m / b) +1) - (floor(m / LCM(a,b)) +1)

Simplify: floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) +1 - floor(m / LCM(a,b))

In the third example: 8 +7 +1 -1=15, but in reality, it's 17.

Wait, not matching.

In the first example: 0 +0 +1 -0=1, but in reality, it's 2.

Not matching again.

I'm getting confused here.

Let me consider that when t is a multiple of a and b, the number of visible fireworks is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/ a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m)/ b)

As t is a multiple of a and b, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/ a) = ceil(m / a)

Similarly for b.

So, total is ceil(m / a) + ceil(m / b)

In the first example: ceil(4 /6 ) + ceil(4 /7 )=1 +1=2, which matches.

In the third example: ceil(56 /7 ) + ceil(56 /8 )=8 +7=15, but in reality, it's 17.

So, perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when t is a multiple of LCM(a,b), the number of visible fireworks is higher due to overlapping launch times.

But in the third example, at t=112, which is a multiple of LCM(7,8)=56, the number of visible fireworks is 17, which is higher than 15.

So, perhaps the maximum is ceil(m / a) + ceil(m / b) + floor(m / LCM(a,b))

In the third example: 8 +7 +1=16, still not matching 17.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(m / a) + ceil(m / b) + floor(m / LCM(a,b)) +1

In the third example:8 +7 +1 +1=17, matches.

In the first example:1 +1 +0 +1=3, but in reality, it's 2.

Not matching.

In the case where a=b=5, m=10:

ceil(10 /5 ) + ceil(10 /5 ) + floor(10 /5 ) +1=2 +2 +2 +1=7, but in reality, it's 4.

Still not matching.

I need to find a better formula.

Let me consider that the maximum number of visible fireworks is the sum of the maximum visible from each installation minus the overlapping launches.

The maximum visible from a is floor(m / a) +1

Similarly for b.

The overlapping launches are floor(m / LCM(a,b)) +1

So, total is floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1 - (floor(m / LCM(a,b)) +1)

Simplify: floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) +1 - floor(m / LCM(a,b))

In the third example:8 +7 +1 -1=15, but actual is 17.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to add floor(m / GCD(a,b))

Wait, that seems arbitrary.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the maximum number of visible fireworks is m // a + m // b + 2, which seems to be the formula used in the given program.

In the third example, m // a + m // b +2=56//7 +56//8 +2=8 +7 +2=17, which matches.

In the first example,4//6 +4//7 +2=0 +0 +2=2, which matches.

In the fifth example, m=1, a=1, b=1:1//1 +1//1 +2=1 +1 +2=4, which matches.

In the case where a=b=5, m=10:10//5 +10//5 +2=2 +2 +2=6, but in reality, it's 4.

So, this formula overcounts in some cases.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for a=1, b=1, m=1, the output is 4.

Let me think about a=1, b=1, m=1.

Launch times for both installations: t=1,2,3,...

Each firework is visible from t to t +1 inclusive.

At t=1:

Fireworks from a launched at t=1 (visible from 1 to 2)

Fireworks from b launched at t=1 (visible from 1 to 2)

So, at t=1, two fireworks are visible.

At t=2:

Fireworks from a launched at t=1 and t=2 (visible from 1 to 3)

Fireworks from b launched at t=1 and t=2 (visible from 1 to 3)

So, at t=2, four fireworks are visible: two from a and two from b.

Similarly, at t=3:

Fireworks from a: t
