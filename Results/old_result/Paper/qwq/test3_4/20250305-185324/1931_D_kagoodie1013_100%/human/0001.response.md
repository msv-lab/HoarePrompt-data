Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp has two favorite integers, x and y, and he has an array of numbers. He considers a pair of indices <i, j> beautiful if two conditions are met: first, the sum of the elements at those indices is divisible by x, and second, the difference between those elements is divisible by y. My task is to find out how many such beautiful pairs exist in the array for each test case.

First, I need to understand what it means for a sum or difference to be divisible by a number. If a + b is divisible by x, that means (a + b) % x == 0. Similarly, if a - b is divisible by y, then (a - b) % y == 0.

Given that, I need to find all pairs (i, j) where i < j, and both these conditions hold.

Looking at the example, with x=5, y=2, and array [1,2,7,4,9,6], the beautiful pairs are <1,5> and <4,6>. Let's verify that:

- For <1,5>: a1 + a5 = 1 + 9 = 10, which is divisible by 5; a1 - a5 = 1 - 9 = -8, which is divisible by 2.

- For <4,6>: a4 + a6 = 4 + 6 = 10, divisible by 5; a4 - a6 = 4 - 6 = -2, divisible by 2.

So, the code should return 2 for this test case.

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems to be reading input, parsing it into test cases, and then processing each test case with a function called func_1, which returns the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Let's dive into func_1 to see how it works.

In func_1, for each test case, it initializes a count to 0 and a residue_map as an empty dictionary. Then, it iterates through each number in the array.

For each number num, it calculates r_x as -num % x and r_y as num % y. It then looks up in the residue_map for the key (r_x, r_y) and adds the corresponding value to the count. After that, it updates the residue_map with the current num's residues (num % x, num % y) and increments its count.

Finally, it appends the count to the results list.

Wait a minute, this seems a bit tricky. Let's see if I can understand why it's doing this.

The idea here is to use some kind of hashing or counting mechanism to keep track of residues and find pairs that satisfy both conditions.

First, I need to recall some properties of modulo operations.

If a + b is divisible by x, then (a + b) % x == 0.

Similarly, if a - b is divisible by y, then (a - b) % y == 0.

I need to find pairs where both these conditions are true.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to iterate through all possible pairs, but that would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2*10^5 per test case, and with t up to 10^4, that's unacceptable.

So, we need a smarter way, probably using some mathematical insights to reduce the complexity.

Let's consider the conditions:

1. (a + b) % x == 0

2. (a - b) % y == 0

Let me see if I can express these conditions in terms of a and b's residues modulo x and y.

Let’s denote:

a ≡ p (mod x)

b ≡ q (mod x)

Then, (a + b) ≡ (p + q) (mod x)

For (a + b) % x == 0, we need p + q ≡ 0 (mod x), which means q ≡ -p (mod x)

Similarly, for (a - b) % y == 0:

a ≡ b (mod y)

So, a ≡ b ≡ r (mod y), for some r.

Wait, but a and b can have different residues modulo y, as long as their difference is divisible by y.

Actually, a - b ≡ 0 (mod y), which means a ≡ b (mod y)

So, a and b should have the same residue modulo y.

Interesting.

So, combining both conditions:

- a + b ≡ 0 (mod x)

- a ≡ b (mod y)

Hmm.

Is there a way to find pairs that satisfy both of these simultaneously?

Let me try to express b in terms of a.

From the second condition, b ≡ a (mod y), so b = a + k*y for some integer k.

Then, plugging into the first condition:

a + b = a + (a + k*y) = 2*a + k*y ≡ 0 (mod x)

So, 2*a + k*y ≡ 0 (mod x)

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe there's another way.

Let me consider the residues of a and b modulo x and y.

Since a ≡ b (mod y), and a + b ≡ 0 (mod x), perhaps I can find a way to group elements based on their residues and count pairs accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the array and for each element, determine what the other element should be to form a beautiful pair.

But that also seems non-trivial.

Now, looking back at the provided code, it seems to be using some kind of residue mapping to count pairs efficiently.

Let me try to understand what it's doing.

For each num in the array:

r_x = -num % x

r_y = num % y

Then, it looks up the count of pairs where the residue is (r_x, r_y) in the residue_map and adds that to the count.

Then, it updates the residue_map with the current num's residues (num % x, num % y).

Wait, but I'm getting confused here.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a number a_i.

I need to find a_j such that:

1. a_i + a_j ≡ 0 (mod x)

2. a_i - a_j ≡ 0 (mod y)

From the second condition, a_j ≡ a_i (mod y)

From the first condition, a_j ≡ -a_i (mod x)

So, a_j must satisfy:

a_j ≡ -a_i (mod x)

and

a_j ≡ a_i (mod y)

So, for each a_i, I need to find a_j such that a_j ≡ -a_i (mod x) and a_j ≡ a_i (mod y)

This seems like a system of congruences.

In other words, find a_j such that:

a_j ≡ -a_i (mod x)

and

a_j ≡ a_i (mod y)

This is similar to solving a system of simultaneous congruences.

Under certain conditions, such a system has a solution depending on x and y being coprime or not.

But in this problem, x and y can be any integers, including duplicates.

This seems complicated.

Is there a better way to count such pairs without solving the system for each a_i?

Let me consider the residue_map approach in the code.

In the code, for each num, it computes r_x = -num % x and r_y = num % y, and looks up how many times this pair has been seen before.

Then, it updates the residue_map with the current num's (num % x, num % y).

Wait, perhaps the residue_map is keeping track of the residues (a % x, a % y) for each a in the array, and for each new num, it looks for how many times the required pair (r_x, r_y) has been seen so far.

That makes sense in a way.

Let me see.

For example, take the first test case:

n=6, x=5, y=2, a=[1,2,7,4,9,6]

Let's walk through the algorithm step by step.

Initialize count=0, residue_map={}

Process num=1:

r_x = -1 % 5 = 4

r_y = 1 % 2 = 1

Look for (4,1) in residue_map: not found, so add 0 to count.

Then, current_key = (1 % 5, 1 % 2) = (1,1)

residue_map[(1,1)] = 1

count=0

Process num=2:

r_x = -2 % 5 = 3

r_y = 2 % 2 = 0

Look for (3,0) in residue_map: not found, add 0 to count.

current_key = (2 % 5, 2 % 2) = (2,0)

residue_map[(2,0)] = 1

count=0

Process num=7:

r_x = -7 % 5 = -7 % 5 = 3 % 5 = 3

r_y = 7 % 2 = 1

Look for (3,1) in residue_map: not found, add 0 to count.

current_key = (7 % 5, 7 % 2) = (2,1)

residue_map[(2,1)] = 1

count=0

Process num=4:

r_x = -4 % 5 = 1 % 5 = 1

r_y = 4 % 2 = 0

Look for (1,0) in residue_map: not found, add 0 to count.

current_key = (4 % 5, 4 % 2) = (4,0)

residue_map[(4,0)] = 1

count=0

Process num=9:

r_x = -9 % 5 = -9 % 5 = 1 % 5 = 1

r_y = 9 % 2 = 1

Look for (1,1) in residue_map: found, residue_map[(1,1)]=1, add 1 to count.

current_key = (9 % 5, 9 % 2) = (4,1)

residue_map[(4,1)] = 1

count=1

Process num=6:

r_x = -6 % 5 = -6 % 5 = 4 % 5 = 4

r_y = 6 % 2 = 0

Look for (4,0) in residue_map: found, residue_map[(4,0)]=1, add 1 to count.

current_key = (6 % 5, 6 % 2) = (1,0)

residue_map[(1,0)] = 1

count=2

So, total count=2, which matches the expected output.

Interesting, it works for this case.

Let me try another test case to verify.

Take the second test case:

7 9 5

1 10 15 3 8 12 15

Expected output: 0

Let's walk through:

Initialize count=0, residue_map={}

Process num=1:

r_x = -1 % 9 = 8

r_y = 1 % 5 = 1

Look for (8,1) in residue_map: not found, add 0 to count.

current_key = (1 % 9, 1 % 5) = (1,1)

residue_map[(1,1)] = 1

count=0

Process num=10:

r_x = -10 % 9 = -10 % 9 = 8 % 9 = 8

r_y = 10 % 5 = 0

Look for (8,0) in residue_map: not found, add 0 to count.

current_key = (10 % 9, 10 % 5) = (1,0)

residue_map[(1,0)] = 1

count=0

Process num=15:

r_x = -15 % 9 = -15 % 9 = 3 % 9 = 3

r_y = 15 % 5 = 0

Look for (3,0) in residue_map: not found, add 0 to count.

current_key = (15 % 9, 15 % 5) = (6,0)

residue_map[(6,0)] = 1

count=0

Process num=3:

r_x = -3 % 9 = 6

r_y = 3 % 5 = 3

Look for (6,3) in residue_map: not found, add 0 to count.

current_key = (3 % 9, 3 % 5) = (3,3)

residue_map[(3,3)] = 1

count=0

Process num=8:

r_x = -8 % 9 = 1

r_y = 8 % 5 = 3

Look for (1,3) in residue_map: not found, add 0 to count.

current_key = (8 % 9, 8 % 5) = (8,3)

residue_map[(8,3)] = 1

count=0

Process num=12:

r_x = -12 % 9 = -12 % 9 = 6 % 9 = 6

r_y = 12 % 5 = 2

Look for (6,2) in residue_map: not found, add 0 to count.

current_key = (12 % 9, 12 % 5) = (3,2)

residue_map[(3,2)] = 1

count=0

Process num=15:

r_x = -15 % 9 = 3

r_y = 15 % 5 = 0

Look for (3,0) in residue_map: found, residue_map[(3,0)]=1, add 1 to count.

current_key = (15 % 9, 15 % 5) = (6,0)

residue_map[(6,0)] = 2

count=1

Wait, but the expected output is 0, but according to this, count=1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back:

Process num=15:

r_x = -15 % 9 = 3

r_y = 15 % 5 = 0

Look for (3,0) in residue_map: residue_map has (3,0)? Let's see:

residue_map current state:

- (1,1):1

- (1,0):1

- (6,0):1

- (3,3):1

- (8,3):1

- (3,2):1

- (6,0):1 (but it was updated to 2 when processing the second 15)

Wait, but when processing the second 15, residue_map[(3,0)] is not present, because (3,0) is not in the residue_map.

Wait, no, actually, residue_map has (3,0) from the first 15.

Wait, no, let's see:

After processing first 15:

residue_map[(6,0)] = 1

Then, processing 3:

residue_map[(3,3)] = 1

Then, 8:

residue_map[(8,3)] = 1

Then, 12:

residue_map[(3,2)] = 1

Then, second 15:

residue_map[(6,0)] = 2

Wait, but when processing second 15:

r_x = -15 % 9 = 3

r_y = 15 % 5 = 0

Look for (3,0) in residue_map: is (3,0) in residue_map? No, it's (6,0), (3,3), (8,3), (3,2), (6,0).

So, (3,0) is not present, so add 0 to count.

Then, update residue_map[(6,0)] to 2.

So, count remains 0.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was adding 1, but no, residue_map[(3,0)] is not present, so it's 0.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let me list the residue_map after each step:

Start: residue_map = {}

Process 1: r_x=8, r_y=1; look for (8,1): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(1,1)]=1

residue_map: {(1,1):1}

Process 10: r_x=8, r_y=0; look for (8,0): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(1,0)]=1

residue_map: {(1,1):1, (1,0):1}

Process 15: r_x=3, r_y=0; look for (3,0): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(6,0)]=1

residue_map: {(1,1):1, (1,0):1, (6,0):1}

Process 3: r_x=6, r_y=3; look for (6,3): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(3,3)]=1

residue_map: {(1,1):1, (1,0):1, (6,0):1, (3,3):1}

Process 8: r_x=1, r_y=3; look for (1,3): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(8,3)]=1

residue_map: {(1,1):1, (1,0):1, (6,0):1, (3,3):1, (8,3):1}

Process 12: r_x=6, r_y=2; look for (6,2): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(3,2)]=1

residue_map: {(1,1):1, (1,0):1, (6,0):1, (3,3):1, (8,3):1, (3,2):1}

Process 15: r_x=3, r_y=0; look for (3,0): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(6,0)]=2

residue_map: {(1,1):1, (1,0):1, (6,0):2, (3,3):1, (8,3):1, (3,2):1}

So, count=0, which matches the expected output.

Wait, earlier I thought it added 1, but actually, (3,0) is not in the residue_map, so it's 0.

Ok, so the code works for this case as well.

Let me check another test case to be sure.

Take the third test case:

9 4 10

14 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 6

Expected output: 1

Let's walk through:

Initialize count=0, residue_map={}

Process 14:

r_x = -14 % 4 = 2

r_y = 14 % 10 = 4

Look for (2,4): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(2,4)]=1

residue_map: {(2,4):1}

Process 10:

r_x = -10 % 4 = 2

r_y = 10 % 10 = 0

Look for (2,0): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(2,0)]=1

residue_map: {(2,4):1, (2,0):1}

Process 2:

r_x = -2 % 4 = 2

r_y = 2 % 10 = 2

Look for (2,2): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(2,2)]=1

residue_map: {(2,4):1, (2,0):1, (2,2):1}

Process 2:

r_x = -2 % 4 = 2

r_y = 2 % 10 = 2

Look for (2,2): found, residue_map[(2,2)]=1, count+=1; set residue_map[(2,2)]=2

residue_map: {(2,4):1, (2,0):1, (2,2):2}

count=1

Process 11:

r_x = -11 % 4 = 1

r_y = 11 % 10 = 1

Look for (1,1): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(3,1)]=1

residue_map: {(2,4):1, (2,0):1, (2,2):2, (3,1):1}

Process 11:

r_x = -11 % 4 = 1

r_y = 11 % 10 = 1

Look for (1,1): found, residue_map[(1,1)]=0 (not present), actually, is it (3,1)? Wait:

Wait, 11 % 4 = 3, so r_x = -11 % 4 = 1

r_y = 11 % 10 = 1

current_key = (11 % 4, 11 % 10) = (3,1)

So, look for (1,1): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(3,1)]=2

residue_map: {(2,4):1, (2,0):1, (2,2):2, (3,1):2}

count=1

Process 13:

r_x = -13 % 4 = 3

r_y = 13 % 10 = 3

Look for (3,3): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(1,3)]=1

residue_map: {(2,4):1, (2,0):1, (2,2):2, (3,1):2, (1,3):1}

Process 5:

r_x = -5 % 4 = 3

r_y = 5 % 10 = 5

Look for (3,5): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(1,5)]=1

residue_map: {(2,4):1, (2,0):1, (2,2):2, (3,1):2, (1,3):1, (1,5):1}

Process 6:

r_x = -6 % 4 = 2

r_y = 6 % 10 = 6

Look for (2,6): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(2,6)]=1

residue_map: {(2,4):1, (2,0):1, (2,2):2, (3,1):2, (1,3):1, (1,5):1, (2,6):1}

count=1, which matches the expected output.

Ok, so it works for this case as well.

Let me check one more test case.

Take the fourth test case:

9 5 6

10 7 6 7 9 7 7 10 10

Expected output: 3

Walk through:

Initialize count=0, residue_map={}

Process 10:

r_x = -10 % 5 = 0

r_y = 10 % 6 = 4

Look for (0,4): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(0,0)] = 1 (since 10%5=0, 10%6=4)

Wait, no: current_key = (10%5, 10%6) = (0,4)

residue_map[(0,4)] = 1

count=0

Process 7:

r_x = -7 % 5 = 3

r_y = 7 % 6 = 1

Look for (3,1): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(2,1)] = 1 (7%5=2, 7%6=1)

residue_map: {(0,4):1, (2,1):1}

count=0

Process 6:

r_x = -6 % 5 = 4

r_y = 6 % 6 = 0

Look for (4,0): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(1,0)] = 1 (6%5=1, 6%6=0)

residue_map: {(0,4):1, (2,1):1, (1,0):1}

count=0

Process 7:

r_x = -7 % 5 = 3

r_y = 7 % 6 = 1

Look for (3,1): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(2,1)] = 2

residue_map: {(0,4):1, (2,1):2, (1,0):1}

count=0

Process 9:

r_x = -9 % 5 = 1

r_y = 9 % 6 = 3

Look for (1,3): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(4,3)] = 1 (9%5=4, 9%6=3)

residue_map: {(0,4):1, (2,1):2, (1,0):1, (4,3):1}

count=0

Process 7:

r_x = -7 % 5 = 3

r_y = 7 % 6 = 1

Look for (3,1): not found; count+=0; set residue_map[(2,1)] = 3

residue_map: {(0,4):1, (2,1):3, (1,0):1, (4,3):1}

count=0

Process 7:

r_x = -7 % 5 = 3

r_y = 7 % 6 = 1

Look for (3,1): found, residue_map[(3,1)]=0 (not present), actually, it's (2,1):3, but r_x=-7%5=3, r_y=7%6=1, so look for (3,1), which is not present, so count+=0; set residue_map[(2,1)]=4

residue_map: {(0,4):1, (2,1):4, (1,0):1, (4,3):1}

count=0

Process 10:

r_x = -10 % 5 = 0

r_y = 10 % 6 = 4

Look for (0,4): found, residue_map[(0,4)]=1, count+=1; set residue_map[(0,4)]=2

residue_map: {(0,4):2, (2,1):4, (1,0):1, (4,3):1}

count=1

Process 10:

r_x = -10 % 5 = 0

r_y = 10 % 6 = 4

Look for (0,4): found, residue_map[(0,4)]=2, count+=2; set residue_map[(0,4)]=3

residue_map: {(0,4):3, (2,1):4, (1,0):1, (4,3):1}

count=3, which matches the expected output.

Ok, so it seems to be working correctly for this test case as well.

I think the logic in the code is sound. By keeping track of the residues (a % x, a % y) for each element a in the array, and for each new element, looking up the count of elements that can form a beautiful pair with it, it efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs.

Given that it passes the provided test cases and seems logically consistent, I would say that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correctness: True}}\]
