Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Stack has an array `a` of length `n`, and an empty set `S`. He's going to perform an operation `n` times, where in each operation, he selects an index `i` (from 1 to the current length of `a`), inserts `a[i] + i` into the set `S`, and then deletes `a[i]` from `a`. After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain `n` elements, but since it's a set, duplicates are not allowed, so `S` might have fewer than `n` unique elements.

Then, he constructs a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order. Our task is to find the lexicographically largest possible `b` that Stack can make by choosing the indices wisely in each operation.

First, I need to understand what lexicographically largest means in this context. It means that when comparing two arrays, we look for the first position where they differ, and the array with the larger value at that position is considered larger. So, to maximize `b`, we want to have the largest possible elements in `S`, and arranged in descending order.

Given that `S` is a set and only unique elements are allowed, the duplicates are automatically handled, so I don't need to worry about inserting the same value multiple times.

Now, the key part is to decide which index to choose at each step to maximize the final `b`. Since `b` is sorted in decreasing order, the largest elements in `S` will be at the beginning of `b`. So, I need to maximize the largest elements in `S`.

One important observation is that when we delete an element at index `i`, the indices of all elements to the right of `i` decrease by 1. This means that the index values change dynamically as we perform operations.

This dynamic change in indices makes it a bit tricky to keep track of the indices at each step. Maybe there's a way to simplify this.

Let me think differently. Since we're inserting `a[i] + i` into the set, and `i` is the index starting from 1, perhaps there's a way to precompute all possible values of `a[i] + i` and then select a subset of size `n` with unique values, maximizing the largest elements.

Wait, but we have to perform exactly `n` operations, and `S` can have fewer than `n` unique elements, so we might have to repeat some insertions, but only unique values are added to `S`.

Actually, no. Since `S` is a set, inserting a duplicate value doesn't change `S`. So, if we have multiple `a[i] + i` that are the same, only one of them will be added to `S`.

But the problem says that after `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain some unique elements. Our goal is to maximize the sorted array `b` constructed from `S`.

I need to maximize the elements in `S`, meaning that I want to include as many large `a[i] + i` values as possible, and arrange them in descending order.

Perhaps, the best way is to compute all possible `a[i] + i` values, find the unique ones, and sort them in descending order to get `b`.

But wait, the number of unique `a[i] + i` could be less than `n`, because of duplicates. So, `S` might have fewer than `n` elements, and `b` would be that sorted set.

But the problem mentions that `b` is sorted in decreasing order, and we need the lexicographically largest `b`.

Is there a way to influence which elements go into `S` by choosing different indices at each step?

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 2

a = [2, 1]

Possible operations:

1. Choose i=1 (1-based index), insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, delete a[1], so a becomes [1]. Then, choose i=1 again, insert a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 into S. So, S = {3, 2}, and b = [3, 2].

Alternatively, choose i=2 first, insert a[2] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 into S, delete a[2], so a becomes [2]. Then, choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, but since 3 is already in S, it doesn't change. So, S = {3}, and b = [3].

Clearly, [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3].

So, by choosing to insert 3 and then 2, we get a larger `b` than inserting 3 twice, which only gives us S = {3}.

Hence, the strategy should be to include as many unique large values as possible in `S`.

Another example:

n = 3

a = [6,4,8]

Possible operations:

1. Choose i=1, insert 6 + 1 = 7, a becomes [4,8]

2. Choose i=1, insert 4 + 1 = 5, a becomes [8]

3. Choose i=1, insert 8 + 1 = 9, S = {7,5,9}, b = [9,7,5]

Alternatively:

1. Choose i=3, insert 8 + 3 = 11, a becomes [6,4]

2. Choose i=2, insert 4 + 2 = 6, a becomes [6]

3. Choose i=1, insert 6 + 1 = 7, S = {11,6,7}, b = [11,7,6]

This is better than [9,7,5], so [11,7,6] is lexicographically larger.

Another approach:

1. Choose i=1, insert 6 + 1 = 7, a becomes [4,8]

2. Choose i=2, insert 8 + 2 = 10, a becomes [4]

3. Choose i=1, insert 4 + 1 = 5, S = {7,10,5}, b = [10,7,5]

Comparing to [11,7,6], [11,7,6] is larger because 11 > 10.

So, choosing different sequences leads to different `b`.

Hence, to maximize `b`, we need a strategy that includes the largest possible unique values in `S`.

I need to find a way to select indices such that the largest possible unique `a[i] + i` values are included in `S`.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to sort the `a[i] + i` values in descending order, and pick the unique ones from that list, filling in the gaps if necessary.

But I need to consider that when I delete an element at a certain index, the indices of the remaining elements change.

This dynamic change in indices complicates things.

Is there a way to staticize the indices?

Let me consider that initially, the array is a[1], a[2], ..., a[n].

After deleting a[i], the elements to the right of it shift left by one position.

But keeping track of this dynamically for each operation seems inefficient, especially since n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that each element a[i] can be associated with a value a[i] + k, where k is its current index during any operation.

But since the indices change dynamically, this is tricky.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can precompute all possible a[i] + i values, collect them, and then select the largest unique values, filling in the remaining spots with the next largest possible values.

But I need to ensure that the final `b` is sorted in decreasing order and is lexicographically largest.

Wait, perhaps I can collect all possible a[i] + i values, sort them in descending order, and then remove duplicates, keeping only the unique values.

Then, if there are duplicates, I need to handle them carefully.

Wait, but the set S automatically handles duplicates, only keeping unique values.

So, to maximize `b`, I need to include as many unique large values as possible.

Hence, perhaps the best strategy is to sort all possible a[i] + i values in descending order, remove duplicates, and then fill in the remaining spots with the next largest possible unique values.

But I need to make sure that I can actually achieve this sequence by performing the operations in a certain order.

Let me think about how to model this.

Suppose I have all possible a[i] + i values, and I sort them in descending order.

Then, I can try to select the largest unique values first, ensuring that I can actually achieve this sequence by choosing the corresponding indices in the operations.

But keeping track of the dynamic indices is complicated.

Is there a way to staticize the indices?

Let me consider that each element a[i] is associated with a specific position i, and when I delete an element, the indices of the remaining elements change.

But maybe I can think in terms of choosing elements without considering their indices dynamically, but rather based on their a[i] + i values.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that to maximize S, I should aim to include the largest possible a[i] + i values, and to do that, I should prioritize elements with higher a[i] + i.

But I need to make sure that I don't choose elements that would lead to duplicates in S.

Wait, but since S is a set, duplicates are automatically handled.

Hence, perhaps the best approach is to collect all possible a[i] + i values, sort them in descending order, remove duplicates, and output the sorted list.

But in the first test case, if I do that, I have a[1] + 1 = 3 and a[2] + 2 = 3, so sorted in descending order is [3], which matches the first approach.

But according to the explanation, selecting i=1 first and then i=1 again gives S={3,2}, which is better.

Wait, but a[2] + 2 = 3, and a[1] + 1 = 3, but when I select i=1 first, a becomes [1], and then a[1] + 1 = 2.

So, S={3,2}.

If I select i=2 first, a[2] + 2 = 3, then a becomes [2], and a[1] + 1 = 3, but since 3 is already in S, it remains {3}.

Hence, by choosing to select i=1 first, I can include both 3 and 2 in S, which is better.

So, sometimes, choosing an element that doesn't give the current maximum a[i] + i can lead to including more unique values in S.

Hence, simply sorting all a[i] + i in descending order and removing duplicates may not give the optimal `b`.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that I need to maximize the minimal element in S.

Wait, no, I need to maximize the entire array `b` lexicographically.

So, I need to maximize the first element, then the second, and so on.

Given that `b` is sorted in decreasing order, the first element is the largest in S, the second is the second largest, and so on.

Hence, to maximize `b` lexicographically, I need to maximize the largest element in S, then the second largest, and so on.

So, I need to include as many large unique values in S as possible.

But since S is a set and only unique values are allowed, I need to select operations that add unique values to S.

This seems tricky because the values depend on both a[i] and i, and i changes dynamically as elements are deleted.

Is there a way to model this statically?

Let me consider that each element a[i] can contribute a value of a[i] + k, where k is its current index during any operation.

But keeping track of k for each element is complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each element a[j], its contribution is a[j] + i, where i is the position it's in when it's selected.

But since elements are being deleted and indices are shifting, this is not straightforward.

Is there a way to precompute all possible contributions and select a subset of size up to n with unique values, maximizing the lexicographical order of the sorted list?

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort all possible a[i] + i values in descending order, and then try to select as many unique values as possible, starting from the largest.

But in the first test case, that would give me [3,2], which matches the optimal solution.

In the second test case, with n=5 and a=[1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000], the a[i]+i values are:

1+1=2, 100+2=102, 1000+3=1003, 1000000+4=1000004, 1000000000+5=1000000005.

All are unique, so S={2,102,1003,1000004,1000000005}, and b=[1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2], which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, a=[6,4,8], a[i]+i are:

6+1=7, 4+2=6, 8+3=11.

All are unique, so S={7,6,11}, b=[11,7,6], which again matches the sample output.

Hence, in these cases, simply sorting the a[i]+i values in descending order and removing duplicates gives the correct `b`.

But is this always true?

Wait, in the first test case, a=[2,1], a[i]+i are 3 and 3.

Sorting in descending order gives [3], which is correct, as choosing to include 2 in S as well leads to [3,2], which is better.

But according to this approach, I should only have [3], but in reality, I can have [3,2].

So, there's something missing here.

Ah, I see. In the first test case, when I choose i=1 first, a[1]+1=3, then a becomes [1], and a[1]+1=2, so S={3,2}.

But if I choose i=2 first, a[2]+2=3, then a becomes [2], and a[1]+1=3, but 3 is already in S, so S={3}.

Hence, choosing to include a smaller value (2) along with the larger one (3) is beneficial.

So, simply sorting a[i]+i in descending order and removing duplicates doesn't account for the possibility of including smaller values that don't duplicate existing ones.

Hence, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that I need to select a sequence of operations that maximizes the multiset of unique values added to S.

I need to maximize the sorted list of these unique values in decreasing order.

This sounds similar to maximizing a set of unique values, where I can choose to include smaller values as long as they don't duplicate existing ones.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Compute all possible a[i] + i values.

2. Sort these values in descending order.

3. Iterate through this sorted list, adding unique values to S until S has up to n unique values.

This seems similar to what I did before, but in the first test case, it didn't account for including 2 along with 3.

Wait, in the first test case, a[i]+i are both 3, so sorting gives [3,3]. Removing duplicates gives [3], but in reality, I can have [3,2].

So, this approach fails here.

Hence, I need to find a way to include as many unique smaller values as possible, in addition to the larger ones.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after including a larger value, I can include smaller values that are unique.

In the first test case, after including 3, I can include 2, which is unique and smaller.

Hence, perhaps I need to sort all possible a[i]+i values in descending order, and then select as many unique values as possible, filling in smaller unique values when possible.

But how do I know which smaller values are possible to include?

This seems tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have all possible a[i]+i values, and I sort them in descending order.

Then, I can build S by iterating through this sorted list and adding unique values until I can't add any more unique values.

But in the first test case, this would give me S={3,2}, which is correct.

In the second test case, all a[i]+i are unique, so S contains all of them.

In the third test case, all a[i]+i are unique, so S contains all of them.

Hence, perhaps this approach works.

But I need to confirm if this is always correct.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=3, a=[1,2,3].

Possible a[i]+i are:

a[1]+1=2, a[2]+2=4, a[3]+3=6.

Sorted in descending order: [6,4,2].

S={6,4,2}, b=[6,4,2].

Alternatively, if I choose i=1 first, insert 2, a becomes [2,3].

Then choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, S={2,3}, a becomes [3].

Then choose i=1, insert 3+1=4, S={2,3,4}, b=[4,3,2].

But according to the sorted approach, I get [6,4,2], which is better.

Hence, there must be a way to include 6,4,2.

But how can I include 6,4,2 in S?

If I choose i=3 first, insert 6, a becomes [1,2].

Then choose i=2, insert 2+2=4, S={6,4}, a becomes [1].

Then choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, S={6,4,2}, b=[6,4,2].

This is better than [4,3,2].

Hence, the sorted approach seems correct.

Another example: n=4, a=[1,1,1,1].

a[i]+i are: 2,3,4,5.

Sorted in descending order: [5,4,3,2].

S={5,4,3,2}, b=[5,4,3,2].

If I choose i=4 first, insert 5, a becomes [1,1,1].

Choose i=3, insert 4, S={5,4}, a becomes [1,1].

Choose i=2, insert 3, S={5,4,3}, a becomes [1].

Choose i=1, insert 2, S={5,4,3,2}, b=[5,4,3,2].

This matches the sorted approach.

Hence, it seems that sorting all a[i]+i in descending order and removing duplicates gives the correct `b`.

But in the first test case, a=[2,1], a[i]+i are 3 and 3.

Sorted in descending order: [3,3]. Unique values: [3].

But in reality, we can have S={3,2}.

Wait, a[1]+1=3, a[2]+2=3.

After choosing i=1, a becomes [1], then a[1]+1=2.

Hence, S={3,2}.

But according to the sorted approach, we only have [3], missing 2.

Hence, the sorted approach fails here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when multiple a[i]+i are the same, I can still include smaller values if they are unique and not yet in S.

Hence, perhaps I need to sort all a[i]+i in descending order, and then for each value, if it's not already in S, add it to S.

But in the first test case, both a[i]+i are 3, so S={3}, but I can include 2 as well, which is unique.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider that after including 3, I can include 2, since it's unique.

Hence, perhaps I need to sort all a[i]+i in descending order, and then include as many unique values as possible, starting from the largest.

But in the first test case, after including 3, I can include 2, since it's unique.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider that for each operation, I can choose to include the current a[i]+i if it's not already in S, and if it allows me to include more unique smaller values in the future.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I collect all possible a[i]+i values, sort them in descending order, and then build S by including unique values from this list, ensuring that I include as many smaller unique values as possible.

But I need a way to handle duplicates properly.

Wait, perhaps I can count the frequency of each a[i]+i value, and include up to one instance of each value in S.

But in the first test case, both a[i]+i are 3, so S={3}, but in reality, I can have S={3,2}.

Hence, this approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when I choose an element, I not only add a[i]+i to S but also remove that element from a, affecting future operations.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider the sequence of operations carefully.

This seems too time-consuming for large n.

Is there a smarter way?

Let me consider that the final S is a set of unique values, and I need to maximize the sorted list of these values in decreasing order.

Hence, I need to maximize the minimal element in S, then the next minimal, and so on.

This sounds like a greedy approach.

Hence, perhaps I should aim to include as many unique large values as possible, and then fill in with the next largest unique values that don't duplicate existing ones.

Hence, perhaps sorting all a[i]+i in descending order and selecting unique values is sufficient.

But in the first test case, this misses 2, which is actually possible to include.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider that for each operation, I can choose to include a smaller unique value, as long as it doesn't duplicate existing ones.

Hence, perhaps I need to sort all a[i]+i in descending order, and then build S by including unique values, considering that some values can be included multiple times if they are unique.

But this seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each operation, I can choose to include a[i]+i, and if it's unique, add it to S.

Hence, to maximize S, I should aim to include as many unique large values as possible, and then include smaller unique values if possible.

Hence, perhaps sorting all a[i]+i in descending order and including unique values is the way to go.

But in the first test case, this doesn't include 2, but in reality, I can include both 3 and 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after including 3, I can include 2, even though 2 is not among the original a[i]+i values.

Wait, no, 2 is a[i]+i for a[2]+2=1+2=3, and a[1]+1=2+1=3.

Wait, no, a=[2,1], so a[1]=2, a[2]=1.

Hence, a[1]+1=3, a[2]+2=3.

After choosing i=1, a becomes [1], then a[1]+1=2.

Hence, S={3,2}.

But according to the sorted approach, sorting [3,3] and removing duplicates gives [3], missing 2.

Hence, the sorted approach is incomplete.

Hence, I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that S is built by including unique a[i]+i values, and that by choosing operations in a certain order, I can include additional unique values.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider the multiset of a[i]+i values, sort them in descending order, and then build S by including unique values, but also considering the counts of duplicates.

Wait, perhaps I need to include the unique a[i]+i values, and then for duplicates, see if I can include smaller unique values by choosing different operations.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I have all possible a[i]+i values, and I sort them in descending order.

Then, I can build S by including unique values from this list, and for duplicates, I can try to include smaller unique values by choosing operations that allow it.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that for each value in the sorted list, I can include it in S if it's unique so far, and if I have not included it yet.

But in the first test case, this would still miss 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each operation, I can choose to include a[i]+i, and if it's already in S, I can choose to include a smaller unique value instead.

But this is too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal number of unique values in S is the number of unique a[i]+i values, and the maximal is n, if all a[i]+i are unique.

But in the first test case, even if all a[i]+i are the same, S can have more elements if I can include smaller unique values by choosing operations in a certain order.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider that S can have up to n unique values, but some values might be forced to be duplicates.

But I need a way to maximize the unique values in S.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the largest possible set of unique a[i]+i values that can be included in S by choosing operations in a certain order.

But this seems too abstract.

Let me try to think about it in terms of graph theory or some other structure, but that might be overkill.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that sorting all a[i]+i in descending order and including unique values is sufficient, even if it misses some smaller unique values in certain cases.

But in the first test case, it misses 2, which is actually possible to include.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that for each operation, I can choose to include the largest possible unique a[i]+i value that hasn't been included yet, and adjust the array accordingly.

This sounds like a greedy approach.

Hence, perhaps I should sort all a[i]+i values in descending order, and then iterate through them, including each unique value in S, and skipping duplicates.

But in the first test case, this would miss 2.

Hence, perhaps I need to modify this approach to allow including smaller unique values when possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each operation, I can choose to include the largest possible unique a[i]+i that hasn't been included yet, and if that value is already in S, choose the next largest unique value that can be included.

This seems more promising.

Hence, perhaps I need to collect all a[i]+i values, sort them in descending order, and then build S by including unique values, and when a value is duplicate, skip it and move to the next unique value.

But in the first test case, this would still miss 2, unless I consider that after including 3, I can include 2 as it's unique.

Hence, perhaps I need to keep track of the values already in S, and include the next largest unique value not in S.

But this seems similar to what I already described.

Wait, perhaps I need to collect all a[i]+i values, sort them in descending order, and then build S by including the first n unique values from this sorted list, ensuring that I don't include duplicates.

But I need to make sure that it's possible to include these values by choosing operations in a certain order.

In the first test case, sorting gives [3,3], and including unique values gives [3,2], which matches the optimal solution.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider that for each operation, I can choose to include the current largest unique a[i]+i value, and if it's already in S, choose the next largest unique value that can be included.

But I need a way to implement this efficiently.

Let me consider that I can collect all a[i]+i values, sort them in descending order, and then build S by including unique values, and for duplicates, include the next unique smaller value if possible.

But this seems too vague for implementation.

Let me look at the provided program to see how it approaches this problem.

Looking at the program:

- It reads t test cases.

- For each test case, it reads n and the array a.

- It computes a[i] += i + 1, where i is from 0 to n-1 in Python's 0-based indexing.

- Then, it creates a Counter of a.

- It converts a to a set, sorts it in descending order, and initializes cnt = n - len(a), cur = 0.

- Then, it iterates through the sorted a, and for each element, if it's not the first, it calculates how many additional unique values can be added between the previous and current element, and appends those values to ans.

- It appends the current element to ans, decreases the counter in Counter(a[i]), and updates cur.

- Finally, it appends cnt number of elements decremented by 1 from the last element.

- It prints the ans array.

Wait, this seems to be trying to build the array b by including the unique a[i]+i values in descending order, and filling in the gaps with decremented values.

In the first test case, a=[2,1], after adding indices, a becomes [3,3].

Set of a is {3}, sorted in descending order is [3].

cnt = n - len(a) = 2 - 1 = 1

cur = 0

Iterate through a:

i=0, a[0]=3

Since i>0 is False, append 3 to ans

counter[3] -=1, cur += counter[3] (which is 0)

Then, for _ in range(cnt)=1:

append ans[-1]-1=3-1=2

Hence, ans=[3,2], which matches the optimal solution.

Hence, this approach seems to work.

In the second test case, a=[1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000], a[i]+i+1 are:

1+1=2, 100+2=102, 1000+3=1003, 1000000+4=1000004, 1000000000+5=1000000005

Set of a is {2,102,1003,1000004,1000000005}, sorted descending: [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2]

cnt = n - len(a)=5-5=0

Hence, ans=[1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2], which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, a=[6,4,8], a[i]+i+1 are:

6+1=7, 4+2=6, 8+3=11

Set of a is {7,6,11}, sorted descending: [11,7,6]

cnt = n - len(a)=3-3=0

ans=[11,7,6], which matches the sample output.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

But in the first test case, where a=[3,3], set is {3}, sorted descending is [3]

cnt = 2 -1=1

ans starts as []

i=0, a[i]=3

since i>0 is False, append 3 to ans

counter[3]-=1, cur += counter[3]=1

then, for _ in range(cnt)=1:

append ans[-1]-1=3-1=2

Hence, ans=[3,2], which is correct.

Hence, this approach seems to work.

So, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See the provided program}} \]
