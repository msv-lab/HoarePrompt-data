Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle with dimensions a by b, both integers. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a single cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he wants to take these two smaller rectangles and arrange them (possibly rotating them) to form a new rectangle. The catch is that if the new rectangle is just a rotation of the original one, it doesn't count as a different rectangle. For example, a 6x4 rectangle is the same as a 4x6 rectangle.

My task is to determine, for given a and b, whether Bob can create a new rectangle that is different from the original one in this way.

First, I need to understand the cutting process. Bob can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically, parallel to one of its sides. So, if he cuts horizontally, he's dividing the height, and if he cuts vertically, he's dividing the width.

Let's consider an example to get a better grasp. Take the example of a 2x6 rectangle.

If Bob cuts it horizontally, say he cuts the height into two parts, but since the height is 2, cutting it would give him two rectangles of 1x6 each. Then, he can arrange these two 1x6 rectangles to form a new rectangle. If he places them side by side horizontally, he gets a 1x12 rectangle. If he places them vertically, he gets a 2x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original. So, in this case, he can form a new rectangle: 1x12.

Alternatively, if he cuts vertically, dividing the width of 6 into, say, 3 and 3, he gets two rectangles of 2x3 each. Then, arranging these two 2x3 rectangles can give him a 4x3 rectangle or a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

So, in this case, it seems possible to create a new rectangle.

Now, consider a 2x1 rectangle.

If he cuts horizontally, dividing the height of 2 into 1 and 1, he gets two 1x1 rectangles. Arranging two 1x1 rectangles can only give him a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original. So, no new rectangle is formed.

If he cuts vertically, dividing the width of 1, which isn't possible since 1 can't be divided into two integers greater than 0. So, only horizontal cutting is possible, leading to the same conclusion.

Therefore, for 2x1, it's not possible to form a new rectangle.

From these examples, I need to find a general rule for any a and b.

Let's think about the conditions under which Bob can form a new rectangle.

First, Bob needs to make a cut parallel to one of the sides. So, he can choose to cut either the height or the width.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the width (cutting the height).

Suppose he cuts the height a into two parts, say c and a - c, where c is an integer between 1 and a-1. Then, the two rectangles obtained are c x b and (a - c) x b.

Now, he can arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle. He can place them side by side either horizontally or vertically.

If he places them horizontally, the new rectangle would have dimensions (c + a - c) x b = a x b, which is the same as the original.

If he places them vertically, the new rectangle would have dimensions max(c, a - c) x 2b.

But wait, no. If he places them vertically, he's stacking one on top of the other, so the width remains the same, and the height becomes c + (a - c) = a, which is the same as the original.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's think again.

Actually, if he has two rectangles of c x b and (a - c) x b, and he wants to arrange them to form a new rectangle:

- If he places them side by side horizontally, the new rectangle would have width c + (a - c) = a and height b, which is the same as the original.

- If he places them vertically, he would stack them, so the width remains b, and the height is c + (a - c) = a, which is again the same as the original.

Hmm, so in this case, it seems like he can't form a new rectangle by cutting parallel to the height.

Wait, but in the earlier example with 2x6, cutting horizontally gave two 1x6 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x12 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6. But according to this reasoning, it shouldn't be possible. So, what's wrong here?

Ah, I see. If he cuts parallel to the height, he divides the height a into c and a - c, resulting in two rectangles c x b and (a - c) x b. If he places them vertically, the resulting rectangle would be (c + (a - c)) x b = a x b, same as original. But if he places them horizontally, he would have max(c, a - c) x 2b. Wait, no.

Actually, if he places them horizontally, he puts them side by side, so the new width is c + (a - c) = a, and height remains b. So, it's still a x b.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about how he can rotate the rectangles.

Let me think again.

Suppose he has two rectangles, c x b and (a - c) x b.

He can rotate each of them by 90 degrees, so each can become b x c and b x (a - c), respectively.

Then, if he places them horizontally, the new rectangle would have width c + (a - c) = a and height b, same as original.

If he places them vertically, the new rectangle would have width max(c, a - c) and height 2b.

Wait, no. If he rotates them to b x c and b x (a - c), and places them vertically, stacking one on top of the other, the width would be b, and the height would be c + (a - c) = a.

Which is the same as the original.

Hmm, so in this case, it seems like he can't form a new rectangle by cutting parallel to the height.

But earlier, in the 2x6 example, it was possible. So, perhaps I need to consider cutting parallel to the width instead.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the width, which means dividing the width b into two parts, say d and b - d, where d is an integer between 1 and b-1.

Then, the two rectangles obtained are a x d and a x (b - d).

Now, he can arrange these two rectangles by placing them side by side horizontally or vertically.

- If he places them horizontally, the new rectangle would have width d + (b - d) = b and height a, same as original.

- If he places them vertically, the new rectangle would have width a and height d + (b - d) = b, same as original.

Again, seems like the same rectangle.

But wait, if he rotates the individual rectangles before arranging them, perhaps he can get a different rectangle.

Each a x d rectangle can be rotated to d x a.

So, if he has two rectangles, d x a and (b - d) x a.

If he places them horizontally, the new rectangle would have width d + (b - d) = b and height a, same as original.

If he places them vertically, the new rectangle would have width a and height d + (b - d) = b, same as original.

Still the same.

Hmm, so maybe cutting parallel to the width doesn't help in this case.

But in the example, it was possible to get a new rectangle. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the 2x6 example, when cutting horizontally, he gets two 1x6 rectangles, which can be placed vertically to form a 1x12 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

Wait, in that case, each 1x6 rectangle is rotated to 6x1, and then placed side by side horizontally to get 6x2, which is the same as 2x6, or placed vertically to get 12x1, which is different.

Wait, but 12x1 is considered different from 2x6 because they are not rotations of each other.

So, in that case, it's possible to get a new rectangle.

So, perhaps my earlier reasoning was incomplete because I didn't consider rotating both rectangles and then arranging them in a way that the combined rectangle is different from the original.

Let me try to generalize this.

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, say R1 and R2, by making a cut parallel to one side.

Then, he can rotate R1 and R2 by 0 or 90 degrees before arranging them to form a new rectangle.

He can arrange them either horizontally (side by side) or vertically (one on top of the other).

He needs to check if there's any way to rotate and arrange R1 and R2 to form a rectangle that is different from the original one, ignoring rotations.

So, for each possible cut (parallel to height or width), and for each way of rotating R1 and R2, and for each way of arranging them (horizontally or vertically), he needs to see if the resulting rectangle is different from the original one.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the area.

The area of the original rectangle is a * b.

After cutting into two smaller rectangles, the total area remains the same: a * b.

When arranging the two smaller rectangles to form a new one, the area is still a * b.

So, the new rectangle must have area a * b.

Therefore, the possible dimensions of the new rectangle are pairs of integers (c, d) such that c * d = a * b, and c <= d.

But we need to consider only those rectangles that can be formed by arranging the two smaller rectangles obtained from the cut.

Moreover, since rotations don't count as different, we can consider only rectangles where c <= d.

Our task is to determine if there exists at least one such rectangle (c, d) different from (a, b) that can be formed by arranging the two smaller rectangles.

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of factors of a * b.

But this seems too broad, as there might be many possible factorizations.

I need to relate the possible cuts to the possible new rectangles.

Let's consider the possible cuts again.

First, cutting parallel to the height:

- Divide a into c and a - c.

- Get two rectangles: c x b and (a - c) x b.

- Each can be rotated to b x c and b x (a - c).

- Arranging them horizontally:

- If not rotated: (c x b) and ((a - c) x b) side by side horizontally: width c + (a - c) = a, height b → a x b.

- If rotated: (b x c) and (b x (a - c)) side by side horizontally: width b + b = 2b, height max(c, a - c) → 2b x max(c, a - c).

- But this would require that 2b x max(c, a - c) is a rectangle with area 2b * max(c, a - c), which is not equal to a * b unless specific conditions are met.

Wait, no. The total area remains a * b, since we're just rearranging the pieces.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the dimensions.

If he has two rectangles, b x c and b x (a - c), and he places them horizontally, the new rectangle would have width b + b = 2b and height max(c, a - c).

But the area would be 2b * max(c, a - c), which should equal a * b.

So, 2b * max(c, a - c) = a * b ⇒ 2 * max(c, a - c) = a.

This implies that max(c, a - c) = a / 2.

So, this would only work if a is even, and c = a / 2.

In that case, max(c, a - c) = a / 2, and 2b * (a / 2) = b * a, which matches the area.

So, in this specific case, when a is even, and c = a / 2, the new rectangle would be 2b x (a / 2).

But, 2b x (a / 2) is the same as a x b, because 2b * (a / 2) = a * b.

Wait, but this is the same as the original rectangle.

So, in this case, it's not different.

Wait, but in the example with 2x6, cutting horizontally into two 1x6 rectangles, and placing them horizontally to get 1x12, which is different from 2x6.

Wait, in that case, a = 2, b = 6, c = 1, a - c = 1.

So, max(c, a - c) = 1, and the new rectangle is 2b x 1 = 12 x 1, which is different from 2x6.

So, in this case, it's possible to get a different rectangle.

But according to the earlier reasoning, 2b x (a / 2) should be equal to a x b, but in this case, 2*6 x 1 = 12 x 1, which is different from 2x6.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when a is even, and c = a / 2, the new rectangle is 2b x (a / 2) = b * a, which is the same as a x b, but in terms of dimensions, it's different if 2b != a.

Wait, in the example, 2b = 12, and a = 2, which are different, so 12x1 is different from 2x6.

So, in this case, it's possible to get a different rectangle.

Similarly, if a is odd, then a / 2 is not an integer, so c cannot be a / 2, hence no such arrangement is possible.

Wait, but in the example with a=3, b=2, it's possible to cut horizontally or vertically.

Wait, in the note, it says for 3x2, it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and from these, a 1x6 rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but 1x6 is the same as 6x1, which is different from 3x2.

So, in this case, it's possible.

But according to the earlier reasoning, if a is even, it's possible, else not.

But in this case, a=3, which is odd, but it's still possible.

So, perhaps my reasoning is incomplete.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, say R1 and R2.

Then, he can rotate R1 and R2 and arrange them to form a new rectangle.

The key is that the new rectangle must have area a*b, and its dimensions must be integers.

Moreover, since rotations don't count, we can assume that the new rectangle has c <= d.

Now, the question is, for given a and b, can we find c and d such that c <= d, c*d = a*b, and (c,d) != (a,b).

But this seems too broad, as there could be many factors of a*b.

Instead, I need to consider which of these factor pairs can be formed by arranging the two smaller rectangles obtained from the cut.

So, perhaps I need to find if there exists a way to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and arrange them to form a rectangle with dimensions c and d, where c*d = a*b, and (c,d) != (a,b).

This still seems vague.

Let me consider the possible cuts again.

First, cutting parallel to the height:

- Divide a into c and a - c.

- Get two rectangles: c x b and (a - c) x b.

- Each can be rotated to b x c and b x (a - c).

Similarly, cutting parallel to the width:

- Divide b into d and b - d.

- Get two rectangles: a x d and a x (b - d).

- Each can be rotated to d x a and (b - d) x a.

Now, for each of these cases, consider arranging the two smaller rectangles in different ways.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the height:

- Two rectangles: c x b and (a - c) x b.

- Option 1: Place them horizontally side by side.

- New rectangle: (c + (a - c)) x b = a x b (same as original).

- Option 2: Place them vertically one on top of the other.

- New rectangle: max(c, a - c) x 2b.

- But, the area is max(c, a - c) * 2b.

- We need this to be equal to a * b, so max(c, a - c) * 2b = a * b ⇒ max(c, a - c) = a / 2.

- So, only possible if a is even, and c = a / 2.

- In this case, the new rectangle is (a / 2) x 2b.

- But, (a / 2) x 2b is the same as a x b in area, but dimensions are different unless a / 2 = b, which is unlikely.

- However, if a / 2 = b, then it's the same as the original.

- So, unless a / 2 = b, which would mean a = 2b, in which case (a / 2) x 2b = b x 2b, which is different from a x b = 2b x b, but since rotations don't count, it's the same.

- Wait, no. If a = 2b, then the original rectangle is 2b x b, and the new rectangle is b x 2b, which is the same as the original.

- So, in this case, it's not considered a different rectangle.

- Therefore, when a is even, and a != 2b, then it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the example where a=2, b=6, a=2 and b=6, a=2 != 2*6=12, so a != 2b, and a is even, and it's possible to form a different rectangle, which matches.

Similarly, in the case where a=3, b=2, a=3 is odd, but in the note, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but according to this, if a is odd, it shouldn't be possible, but in the example, it is possible.

So, perhaps there's another way to cut and arrange the rectangles.

Wait, maybe cutting parallel to the width instead.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the width.

- Divide b into d and b - d.

- Get two rectangles: a x d and a x (b - d).

- Each can be rotated to d x a and (b - d) x a.

- Arranging them horizontally:

- Option 1: Place them horizontally side by side.

- New rectangle: (a + a) x max(d, b - d) = 2a x max(d, b - d).

- For this to have area a * b, we need 2a * max(d, b - d) = a * b ⇒ max(d, b - d) = b / 2.

- So, only possible if b is even, and d = b / 2.

- Similarly, arranging them vertically:

- New rectangle: max(a, a) x (d + b - d) = a x b (same as original).

So, in this case, only if b is even, and d = b / 2, can we form a new rectangle: 2a x (b / 2).

Similarly, if b is even and b != 2a, then it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the example where a=3, b=2, a=3 is odd, b=2 is even.

So, cutting parallel to the width, b=2, which is even, so d=1, b-d=1.

Then, the two rectangles are 3x1 and 3x1.

Arranging them horizontally: 3 + 3 = 6 x 1, which is 6x1.

This is different from the original 3x2.

Hence, it's possible.

So, in this case, even though a is odd, since b is even, it's possible to form a different rectangle by cutting parallel to the width.

Similarly, if a is even, regardless of b, or if b is even, regardless of a, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the example where a=1, b=1, both are odd, and it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Similarly, a=2, b=1, a is even, but it's not possible.

Wait, in a=2, b=1, cutting parallel to the height: a=2, cut into c=1 and a - c=1.

Get two 1x1 rectangles.

Arranging them horizontally: 1 + 1 = 2 x 1 (same as original).

Arranging them vertically: max(1,1)=1 x 2b=2*1=2, so 1x2, which is the same as 2x1.

Hence, no different rectangle is formed.

Similarly, cutting parallel to the width: b=1, can't be divided into two integers.

Hence, not possible.

So, in this case, even though a is even, since b=1, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but according to earlier reasoning, if either a or b is even, it's possible.

But in this case, a=2 is even, but it's not possible.

So, perhaps there are additional constraints.

Wait, in this case, when a=2, b=1, cutting parallel to the height gives two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form 2x1 or 1x2, which are the same as the original.

Cutting parallel to the width isn't possible since b=1 can't be divided into two positive integers.

Hence, it's not possible.

So, perhaps the condition is that either a or b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a.

Wait, in the a=2, b=1 case, a=2, b=1, a=2 != 2*1=2, so a == 2b, hence not possible.

Similarly, in a=1, b=2, a=1 != 2*2=4, so a != 2b, but b=2 == 2*a=2*1=2, so b == 2a.

Hence, not possible.

Wait, but in a=2, b=2, a=2 == 2b=4, which is false, and b=2 == 2a=4, which is also false.

Hence, it should be possible.

Wait, in a=2, b=2, cutting parallel to the height: a=2, cut into c=1 and 1.

Get two 1x2 rectangles.

Arranging them horizontally: 1 + 1 = 2 x 2 (same as original).

Arranging them vertically: max(1,1)=1 x 4, which is 1x4, which is different from 2x2.

Hence, it's possible.

So, in this case, even though a=2 is even, and a != 2b (2 != 4), it's possible.

Wait, but earlier, in a=2, b=1, a=2 is even, and a == 2b (since 2 == 2*1), so it's not possible.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that either a or b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a.

Wait, but in a=4, b=2, a=4 is even, a=4 != 2b=4, b=2 != 2a=8, so it's possible.

Indeed, cutting parallel to the height: cut a=4 into c=2 and 2.

Get two 2x2 rectangles.

Arranging them horizontally: 2 + 2 = 4 x 2 (same as original).

Arranging them vertically: max(2,2)=2 x 4, which is 2x4, which is the same as 4x2.

Hence, no different rectangle.

Wait, but according to the earlier condition, a=4 is even, a != 2b (4 != 4), which is false, so a == 2b, hence not possible.

Wait, a=4, b=2, a=4 == 2b=4, so a == 2b, hence not possible.

Wait, but in the arrangement, 2x4 is the same as 4x2, so no different rectangle is formed.

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

Similarly, in a=2, b=1, a=2 == 2b=2, so not possible.

In a=2, b=2, a=2 != 2b=4, and b=2 != 2a=4, so possible.

Wait, but earlier, in a=2, b=2, arranging vertically gives 1x4, which is different from 2x2.

Hence, it should be possible.

Wait, but according to the condition, if a != 2b and b != 2a, then it's possible.

In a=2, b=2, a=2 != 2b=4, and b=2 != 2a=4, so it should be possible.

But earlier, when arranging, I thought 2x4 is the same as 4x2, which is the same as original 2x2, but wait, 2x4 is different from 2x2.

Wait, no, 2x4 is different from 2x2.

But in this context, 2x4 is different from 2x2, so it's a different rectangle.

Hence, it's possible.

Wait, but in reality, 2x4 is different from 2x2, so it should be considered a different rectangle.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, rectangles that differ only by rotation are considered the same.

But 2x4 and 4x2 are rotations of each other, so they are considered the same.

But 2x2 is different from 2x4.

Hence, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, no, 2x4 and 4x2 are considered the same, but 2x2 is different from both.

Hence, forming a 2x4 from a 2x2 is considered a different rectangle.

Hence, it's possible.

So, the condition seems to be that if either a or b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a, then it's possible.

Wait, but in a=4, b=2, a=4 is even, a=4 == 2b=4, so not possible.

And indeed, in that case, arranging the two 2x2 rectangles only gives 4x2, which is the same as the original.

Hence, no different rectangle is formed.

Similarly, in a=2, b=1, a=2 is even, a=2 == 2b=2, so not possible.

In a=2, b=2, a=2 != 2b=4, and b=2 != 2a=4, so possible.

In a=3, b=2, a=3 is odd, b=2 is even, b=2 != 2a=6, so possible.

In a=1, b=1, both odd, and a=1 != 2b=2, and b=1 != 2a=2, but since both are odd, not possible.

Wait, but according to the condition, if either a or b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a, then possible.

But in a=1, b=1, both odd, so not possible.

In a=2, b=1, a=2 is even, a=2 == 2b=2, so not possible.

In a=2, b=2, a=2 != 2b=4, and b=2 != 2a=4, so possible.

In a=3, b=2, a=3 is odd, b=2 is even, b=2 != 2a=6, so possible.

In a=4, b=2, a=4 is even, a=4 == 2b=4, so not possible.

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

Therefore, the general rule is:

If either a or b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a, then it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Else, it's not possible.

Hence, the program should check if either a or b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a.

If this condition holds, output "Yes", else "No".

Wait, but in the example where a=2, b=2, a=2 != 2b=4, and b=2 != 2a=4, so it should be "Yes", which matches the sample output.

In a=6, b=3, a=6 is even, a=6 != 2b=6, but b=3 != 2a=12, so "Yes", but in the sample input, it's "No".

Wait, in the sample input, for 6 3, the output is "No".

Wait, but according to this condition, it should be "Yes".

Hmm, seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider a=6, b=3.

If I cut parallel to the height, a=6, cut into c=3 and 3.

Get two 3x3 rectangles.

Arranging them horizontally: 3 + 3 = 6 x 3 (same as original).

Arranging them vertically: max(3,3)=3 x 6, which is 3x6, same as original.

Hence, no different rectangle is formed.

If I cut parallel to the width, b=3, cut into d=1 and 2.

Get two rectangles: 6x1 and 6x2.

Arranging them horizontally: 6 + 6 = 12 x 1 and 12 x 2.

Wait, no.

If I have two rectangles, 6x1 and 6x2, and I arrange them horizontally, placing them side by side, the new rectangle would have width 1 + 2 = 3 and height 6, which is the same as the original.

If I arrange them vertically, stacking them, the new rectangle would have width max(6,6)=6 and height 1 + 2 = 3, same as original.

Hence, no different rectangle is formed.

Therefore, in this case, even though a=6 is even, and a != 2b (6 != 6), b=3 != 2a=12, but still, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Hence, my earlier condition is insufficient.

I need to find a better condition.

Let me think about the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

If both a and b are even, then GCD(a, b) is at least 2.

If one of them is even, then GCD(a, b) is at least 1.

Wait, but GCD doesn't directly help here.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider if a and b share any common factors.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether a and b are both even or not.

Wait, in the sample input, for a=6, b=3, both are divisible by 3.

Wait, but 6 and 3 are both divisible by 3.

In this case, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in a=2, b=6, it's possible.

Wait, a=2 and b=6 are both divisible by 2.

But in that case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

So, perhaps if GCD(a, b) > 1 and at least one of a or b is even, then it's possible.

Wait, but in a=6, b=3, GCD(6,3)=3, which is greater than 1, and a=6 is even, but it's not possible.

Hence, this condition doesn't hold.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in order to form a different rectangle, the product a*b must have factor pairs other than (a,b) and (b,a).

Since rotations don't count, we consider (a,b) and (b,a) as the same.

So, if a*b has other factor pairs, we need to check if those can be formed by arranging the two smaller rectangles.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that in order to form a different rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must be arrangeable in a way that their combined dimensions are different from the original.

From earlier analysis, it seems that if either a or b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a, then it's possible, except for some cases like a=6, b=3.

Wait, in a=6, b=3, a=6 is even, a != 2b (6 != 6), b=3 != 2a=12, but it's not possible.

So, perhaps the condition is that both a and b are even, or one is even and the other is odd, but a != 2b and b != 2a.

But in a=6, b=3, a=6 is even, b=3 is odd, a != 2b and b != 2a, but it's not possible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether a*b is divisible by 4.

If either a or b is even, then a*b is even.

If both are even, a*b is divisible by 4.

If only one is even, a*b is divisible by 2.

In the case where a=2, b=1, a*b=2, which is divisible by 2, but it's not possible.

In a=2, b=2, a*b=4, divisible by 4, and it's possible.

In a=3, b=2, a*b=6, divisible by 2, and it's possible.

In a=6, b=3, a*b=18, divisible by 2, but not possible.

Hmm, seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a*b is divisible by 4.

In a=2, b=1, a*b=2, not divisible by 4, not possible.

In a=2, b=2, a*b=4, divisible by 4, possible.

In a=3, b=2, a*b=6, not divisible by 4, possible.

In a=6, b=3, a*b=18, not divisible by 4, not possible.

Wait, but in a=3, b=2, a*b=6, not divisible by 4, but according to the sample, it's "Yes", meaning possible.

Wait, but in a=6, b=3, a*b=18, not divisible by 4, and it's "No".

So, perhaps if a*b is divisible by 4, or (a*b is even and a != 2b and b != 2a), then possible.

Wait, but in a=2, b=1, a*b=2, even, but a=2 == 2b=2, so not possible.

In a=2, b=2, a*b=4, even, a=2 != 2b=4, and b=2 != 2a=4, so possible.

In a=3, b=2, a*b=6, even, a=3 != 2b=4, and b=2 != 2a=6, so possible.

In a=6, b=3, a*b=18, even, a=6 == 2b=6, so not possible.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that a*b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a.

In this case:

- If a*b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a, then "Yes".

- Else, "No".

Let's test this with the sample inputs.

Sample Input:

7

1 1 → No

2 1 → No

2 6 → Yes

3 2 → Yes

2 2 → Yes

2 4 → Yes

6 3 → No

According to the condition:

1. 1*1=1, odd → No

2. 2*1=2, even, but a=2 == 2b=2 → No

3. 2*6=12, even, a=2 != 2b=12, b=6 != 2a=4 → Yes

4. 3*2=6, even, a=3 != 2b=4, b=2 != 2a=6 → Yes

5. 2*2=4, even, a=2 != 2b=4, b=2 != 2a=4 → Yes

6. 2*4=8, even, a=2 != 2b=8, b=4 != 2a=4 → Yes

7. 6*3=18, even, a=6 == 2b=6 → No

This matches the sample outputs.

Hence, the condition is:

If a*b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a, then "Yes", else "No".

Now, to implement this in code.

But in the program given, it's checking if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0, which is equivalent to checking if a*b is even.

But it's not checking the additional conditions that a != 2b and b != 2a.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, if a*b is even, and a != 2b and b != 2a, then "Yes".

But in the program, it's just checking if a is even or b is even, and printing "Yes".

This is incomplete because it doesn't check the additional conditions a != 2b and b != 2a.

However, in the sample inputs, for a=2, b=1, a is even, but a=2 == 2b=2, so it should be "No", and indeed, in the sample, it's "No".

But according to the program, if a is even or b is even, print "Yes", which would incorrectly mark this case as "Yes".

Wait, but in the sample input, for a=2, b=1, it's "No", which contradicts the program's output.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the program, it's checking if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0.

In the case where a=2, b=1, a is even, so it would print "Yes", but according to the correct condition, it should be "No" because a=2 == 2b=2.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle by cutting his original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He can make one cut parallel to one of its sides to get two smaller rectangles.
   - He can rotate and arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - We need to check if the new rectangle is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by rotation are considered the same.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For Bob to form a different rectangle, certain conditions based on the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \) must be met.
   - Specifically, we need to check if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, and that the dimensions do not satisfy \( a = 2b \) or \( b = 2a \).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - If either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, and \( a \neq 2b \) and \( b \neq 2a \), then it's possible to form a different rectangle.
   - Otherwise, it's not possible.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        if (a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0):
            if a != 2 * b and b != 2 * a:
                print('Yes')
            else:
                print('No')
        else:
            print('No')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
   - Parse the number of test cases \( t \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, extract the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \).
   - Check if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even.
   - Ensure that \( a \neq 2b \) and \( b \neq 2a \) to confirm the possibility of forming a different rectangle.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - Print "Yes" if the conditions are met, indicating it's possible to form a different rectangle.
   - Print "No" otherwise.
