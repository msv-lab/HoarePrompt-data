Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add up all those differences.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input. In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. If I arrange it as [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. That matches the example output.

Wait a minute, though. If I arrange it differently, say [3, 1, 2], then beauty would be (1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = -1. That's less than 2. Another arrangement, [2, 3, 1], beauty is (3-2) + (1-3) = 1 - 2 = -1 again. So, arranging it in ascending order seems to give the maximum beauty.

But in the second test case, all elements are the same: [69, 69, 69]. No matter how you arrange them, the differences will always be zero, so the beauty is zero. That makes sense.

In the third test case, n=5 and the array is [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. If I sort it: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. Then beauty is (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57, which matches the example output.

So, it seems like sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of differences gives the maximum beauty. But wait, in the program provided, it sorts the array and then constructs a new array by taking elements from both ends alternately. Let's see why.

Looking at the function func_1:

1. It sorts the array in ascending order.

2. Then, it creates a new array by taking the largest element, then the smallest, then the next largest, then the next smallest, and so on. Essentially, it's arranging the array in a zigzag manner: highest, lowest, second highest, second lowest, etc.

3. Then, it calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in this new array.

Is this necessary? In the first test case, sorted array is [1,2,3]. The new array would be [3,1,2]. Then, beauty is |1-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3. But in the example, it's 2. So, arranging in ascending order gives beauty 2, but this zigzag arrangement gives 3. But the example says 2 is the maximum. So, maybe this isn't the correct way.

Wait, but in the problem statement, beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), not the sum of absolute differences. In the program, it's using abs(), which might not be correct according to the problem.

Let's check the problem again. It says "the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n". So, it's summing up a_i - a_{i-1} without any absolute value.

In the first test case, with arrangement [1,2,3], beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

With arrangement [3,1,2], beauty is (1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = -1.

So, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum beauty of 2, while the zigzag arrangement gives -1, which is less.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it's using absolute differences instead of just a_i - a_{i-1}.

But let's see what the function is doing. It's sorting the array, then creating a new array by alternating from the highest and lowest remaining elements, and then summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Wait, but in the problem, it's not about summing absolute differences; it's about summing a_i - a_{i-1} without absolute values.

So, the program is incorrect because it's using abs(), whereas the problem doesn't ask for absolute differences.

Moreover, in the problem, since a_i - a_{i-1} can be negative if a_i < a_{i-1}, but the beauty is just the sum of these differences, regardless of sign.

In the first test case, arrangement [1,2,3] gives beauty 2, which is the maximum possible, but the program's arrangement [3,1,2] gives beauty -1, which is worse.

So, the program is incorrect because it's not calculating the sum correctly.

Moreover, in the second test case, all elements are equal, so beauty is zero, which matches the program's output, but that's just a coincidence because even with abs(), the difference is zero.

In the third test case, arrangement in ascending order gives beauty (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

If I use the program's arrangement: sorted array is [43,54,80,90,100], then new array is [100,43,90,54,80].

Then, beauty is (43-100) + (90-43) + (54-90) + (80-54) = -57 + 47 -36 + 26.

Calculating that: -57 + 47 = -10, then -10 -36 = -46, then -46 +26 = -20.

But in the example, it's 57. So, clearly, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum beauty.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it's using a different arrangement and absolute differences.

Moreover, in the problem, it's about maximizing the sum of a_i - a_{i-1}, which simplifies to a_n - a_1, because it's a telescoping sum.

Wait, let's see:

Sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n is:

(a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

So, the beauty is simply an - a1, where an and a1 are the last and first elements in the arranged array.

Therefore, to maximize beauty, we need to maximize an - a1.

Given that, we should arrange the array such that an is as large as possible and a1 is as small as possible.

So, to maximize an - a1, we should set an to the maximum value in the array and a1 to the minimum value in the array.

Then, the rest of the elements can be arranged in any order between them, since they cancel out in the sum.

Wait, but actually, since the sum is just an - a1, the elements in between don't affect the sum.

So, no matter how you arrange the middle elements, as long as an is maximum and a1 is minimum, the beauty is maximized.

Therefore, the correct approach is to sort the array in ascending order and then arrange it such that the smallest element is first and the largest is last.

Wait, but according to the telescoping sum, beauty = an - a1.

So, to maximize an - a1, an should be maximum and a1 should be minimum.

So, set an to the maximum value in the array and a1 to the minimum value.

The rest of the elements can be in any order, as they don't affect the sum.

Therefore, the maximum beauty is (max(a) - min(a)).

So, in the first test case, max(a) = 3, min(a) = 1, so beauty = 2, which matches the example.

In the second test case, all elements are 69, so max(a) - min(a) = 0, which matches the example.

In the third test case, max(a) = 100, min(a) = 43, so beauty = 57, which matches the example.

So, the correct beauty is simply max(a) - min(a).

But the program is doing something more complicated: sorting the array, creating a zigzag arrangement, and summing absolute differences.

This is unnecessary and incorrect, as shown in the first test case where it gives -1 instead of 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum "beauty" of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We are given an array `a` of length `n`.
    - We can rearrange the elements of the array in any order.
    - The beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

2. **Simplifying the Beauty Calculation**:
    - The sum (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) simplifies to an - a1 due to telescoping.
    - Therefore, beauty = an - a1.

3. **Maximizing the Beauty**:
    - To maximize an - a1, we should set an to the maximum value in the array and a1 to the minimum value in the array.
    - The intermediate elements can be in any order since they do not affect the beauty.

4. **Algorithm**:
    - For each test case:
        - Find the maximum and minimum values in the array.
        - Compute the beauty as (max - min).

## Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_val = max(arr)
    min_val = min(arr)
    result = max_val - min_val
    print(result)
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
    - Read the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, read the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

- **Finding Maximum and Minimum**:
    - Determine the maximum value (`max_val`) and the minimum value (`min_val`) in the array.

- **Calculating Beauty**:
    - Calculate the beauty as the difference between the maximum and minimum values: `result = max_val - min_val`.

- **Output**:
    - Print the result for each test case.

This approach ensures that we achieve the maximum possible beauty by directly computing the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array, which is the simplified form of the given beauty definition.
