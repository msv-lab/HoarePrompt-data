Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals: the first one every 'a' minutes and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework stays in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive, where x is the launch time.

The question is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks from both installations interact over time. Since both installations start at the same time, their launch times are multiples of 'a' and 'b' respectively.

So, for installation one, fireworks are launched at times: a, 2a, 3a, ..., ka, etc.

Similarly, for installation two: b, 2b, 3b, ..., lb, etc.

Each firework from either installation is visible for m + 1 minutes after launch.

I need to find a time when the最多 number of fireworks are visible in the sky.

I think the key here is to consider the visibility periods of the fireworks and see how they overlap.

Let's consider a specific example to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the input:

6 7 4

So, a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

This means fireworks from the first installation are launched every 6 minutes, and each stays in the sky for 5 minutes (since m + 1 = 5).

Similarly, the second installation launches every 7 minutes, and each firework stays for 5 minutes.

So, let's list out the visibility periods for the first few launches:

Installation 1:

- Launch at t=6: visible from 6 to 10

- Launch at t=12: visible from 12 to 16

- Launch at t=18: visible from 18 to 22

- And so on...

Installation 2:

- Launch at t=7: visible from 7 to 11

- Launch at t=14: visible from 14 to 18

- Launch at t=21: visible from 21 to 25

- And so on...

Now, looking for times when multiple fireworks are visible.

For instance, at t=7:

- Firework from installation 1 launched at t=6 is visible (6-10)

- Firework from installation 2 launched at t=7 is visible (7-11)

So, two fireworks are visible at t=7.

Similarly, at t=14:

- Firework from installation 1 launched at t=12 is visible (12-16)

- Firework from installation 2 launched at t=14 is visible (14-18)

Again, two fireworks are visible.

Looking at t=18:

- Firework from installation 1 launched at t=18 (18-22)

- Firework from installation 2 launched at t=14 (14-18)

But at t=18, the second installation's firework is just ending, while the first installation's is just starting. So, are they both fully visible at t=18? The second one is visible until t=18 inclusive, so yes.

So, still two fireworks.

Wait, but according to the example, the answer is 2, which matches what I've observed.

But let's consider another example:

3 4 10

From the output, the answer is 7.

Let's see:

a = 3, b = 4, m = 10

So, visibility is m + 1 = 11 minutes.

Installation 1 launches at 3,6,9,12,15,...

Visibility:

- 3: 3-13

- 6: 6-16

- 9: 9-19

- 12:12-22

- 15:15-25

- ...

Installation 2 launches at 4,8,12,16,20,...

Visibility:

- 4:4-14

- 8:8-18

- 12:12-22

- 16:16-26

- 20:20-30

- ...

Now, let's look for a time where many of these intervals overlap.

Let's check t=12:

- Installation 1: 12-22 (launch at 12)

- Installation 2: 12-22 (launch at 12)

- Also, installation 1's launch at 9:9-19

- Installation 2's launch at 8:8-18

So at t=12:

- 9-19 (installation 1, launch at 9)

- 12-22 (installation 1, launch at 12)

- 8-18 (installation 2, launch at 8)

- 12-22 (installation 2, launch at 12)

So, four fireworks are visible at t=12.

But according to the sample output, it's 7. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe there are more launches that are visible at a certain time.

Let's try to find a better approach.

I need a general method to calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks at any time.

Given that the launches are periodic with periods 'a' and 'b', and each firework is visible for 'm' minutes after launch.

One way to approach this is to consider all possible launch times and see how their visibility periods overlap.

But since 'a', 'b', and 'm' can be up to 10^18, it's impossible to iterate through all possible times.

I need a smarter way.

I recall that in similar problems involving periodic events, the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods plays a role in determining when events coincide.

But in this case, I need to consider the visibility periods, which are intervals of length 'm'.

I think the key is to find how many launches from each installation have their visibility periods overlapping with a given time.

Since the installations launch fireworks periodically, the number of visible fireworks from one installation at any time can be determined by how many launch times fall within 'm' minutes of that time.

Mathematically, for installation one, the number of visible fireworks at time 't' is the number of integers 'k' such that t - m <= k*a <= t.

Similarly for installation two.

But since 'a' and 'b' can be large, and 'm' can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to calculate this.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix a time 't'. Then, the number of visible fireworks from installation one is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

Similarly for installation two.

So, the total visible fireworks at time 't' would be:

floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b)

I need to maximize this expression over all possible 't'.

Given that 'a' and 'b' are positive integers, and 'm' is non-negative, I need to find the maximum value of this sum.

I recall that the floor function can be tricky to maximize directly, but perhaps I can find a time 't' where both installations have a high number of visible fireworks.

One idea is to choose 't' such that it is as close as possible to multiples of 'a' and 'b', maximizing the number of launches from both installations within 'm' minutes before 't'.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the time when the launches from both installations are densely packed.

Let me consider the time when the launches from both installations are as close as possible to each other.

In other words, the time when the launches are synchronized as much as possible.

The synchronization would happen at multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of 'a' and 'b', but since 'a' and 'b' could be large, and 'm' could be up to 10^18, I need to handle large numbers.

But maybe I don't need the actual LCM, but rather the greatest common divisor (GCD) to find how often the launches coincide.

Wait, actually, the LCM of 'a' and 'b' is a multiple of both 'a' and 'b', so it's the time when both installations launch at the same time.

But since 'a' and 'b' could be co-prime or have some common factors, I need to consider their GCD.

Let me denote G = GCD(a, b)

Then, LCM(a, b) = a * b / G

Now, the installations will launch simultaneously every LCM(a, b) minutes.

But I need to consider the visibility periods, which are m minutes after each launch.

So, perhaps I can calculate how many launches from each installation fall within m minutes of a given time 't', and then sum them up.

But to maximize the total, I need to choose 't' such that the number of visible fireworks from both installations is maximized.

I think the maximum number of visible fireworks would be achieved when 't' is such that both installations have their maximum number of visible fireworks.

For installation one, the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + 1

Similarly, for installation two, it's floor(m / b) + 1

So, if I add them up, I get floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

But in the first sample input, m = 4, a = 6, b = 7

floor(4 / 6) = 0, floor(4 / 7) = 0, so total would be 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the second sample input, m = 10, a = 3, b = 4

floor(10 / 3) = 3, floor(10 / 4) = 2, so total would be 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which matches the sample output.

In the third sample input, m = 56, a = 7, b = 8

floor(56 / 7) = 8, floor(56 / 8) = 7, so total would be 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches the sample output.

Seems like this formula works.

Wait, but let's verify with another example.

Suppose a = 1, b = 1, m = 1

Then, floor(1 / 1) = 1, floor(1 / 1) = 1, so total is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

But according to the last sample input:

1 1 1000000000000000000

floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) = 1000000000000000000, so total would be 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 is correct.

But wait, in the first sample, m = 4, a = 6, b = 7

floor(4 / 6) = 0, floor(4 / 7) = 0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which is correct.

In the second sample, m = 10, a = 3, b = 4

floor(10 / 3) = 3, floor(10 / 4) = 2, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, correct.

In the third sample, m = 56, a = 7, b = 8

floor(56 / 7) = 8, floor(56 / 8) = 7, so 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, correct.

In the fourth sample, m = 78123459896, a = 5, b = 6

floor(78123459896 / 5) = 15624691979, floor(78123459896 / 6) = 13020576649, so 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630, which matches the sample output.

And in the fifth sample, a = 1, b = 1, m = 1

floor(1 / 1) = 1, floor(1 / 1) = 1, so 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, matches the sample.

Lastly, a = 1, b = 1, m = 1000000000000000000

floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) = 1000000000000000000, so 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, matches the sample.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 is correct.

But why does this formula work?

Let me try to understand the reasoning behind it.

For installation one, the number of launches that are visible at time 't' is the number of launches that occurred in the interval [t - m, t].

Since launches are every 'a' minutes, the number of launches in an interval of length m is floor(m / a) + 1.

Similarly for installation two.

So, adding them up gives floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

Hence, the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

This seems to hold for all the sample inputs.

Therefore, the program provided is correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
