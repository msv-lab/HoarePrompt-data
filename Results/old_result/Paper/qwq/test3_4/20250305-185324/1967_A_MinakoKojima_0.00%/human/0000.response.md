Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, I have some cards, each with an integer from 1 to n, and I have a_i cards of each type i. I can buy k new cards, and each new card can be any integer from 1 to n. After buying, I arrange all my cards in a line, and I need to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

First, I need to understand what a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] means in this context. It means that in any subarray of length n, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

So, the task is to arrange all the cards in such a way that there are as many such subarrays as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to maximize the number of permutations in subarrays of length n.

I recall that in array problems, especially those involving subarrays of a fixed length, sliding window techniques are often useful.

But here, it's not just about counting existing subarrays; I can add new cards to optimize the arrangement.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

- n can be up to 2*10^5, which is quite large, so the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n) time.

- k can be up to 10^12, which is a very large number, so I need to handle large numbers efficiently.

- a_i can also be up to 10^12, so I need to be careful with data types and operations.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t (number of test cases) up to 100, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5*10^5, I need an efficient algorithm for each test case.

Let's consider what the score represents. The score is the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

In other words, for each position i from 1 to the total number of cards - n + 1, the subarray from i to i+n-1 should contain each number from 1 to n exactly once.

My goal is to maximize the number of such subarrays.

First, I need to think about how to arrange the cards to maximize these permutations.

One way to approach this is to maximize the number of times the sequence of n cards contains each number exactly once.

I recall that in sliding window problems, we often keep a frequency map of elements in the current window and check if it satisfies certain conditions.

But here, I can proactively choose which cards to add to maximize the number of valid windows.

Given that I can buy k new cards, I need to decide which cards to buy and where to place them to maximize the number of valid subarrays.

This seems complex. Let's try to find a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Let me consider small values of n and k to get an intuition.

Take n=1:

- If n=1, any subarray of length 1 is just a single card, and it's always a permutation of [1], so the score is simply the total number of cards.

- Initially, I have a_1 cards of type 1.

- I can buy k new cards, each of type 1.

- So, total cards = a_1 + k.

- The number of subarrays of length 1 is just the total number of cards, which is a_1 + k.

- So, the score is a_1 + k.

Wait, in the first test case of the example:

Input:

8

1 10

1

...

Output:

11

Which matches a_1 + k = 1 + 10 = 11.

So, for n=1, it's straightforward.

Now, consider n=2.

From the second test case:

2 4

8 4

Output: 15

Let's see:

Initially, 8 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2.

We can buy 4 new cards, each can be of type 1 or 2.

We need to arrange all cards in a line and count the number of subarrays of length 2 that are permutations of [1,2].

A permutation of [1,2] can be [1,2] or [2,1].

So, in the arrangement, every pair of consecutive cards that are different (one 1 and one 2) will count as a valid subarray.

Our goal is to maximize the number of such pairs.

Given that, perhaps it's best to alternate between 1 and 2 as much as possible.

But we have to decide how many new cards of each type to buy.

In the explanation, it says:

"We can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2, and then rearrange the cards as [1,2,1,2,...], which gives 15 subarrays."

Wait, but in the second test case, n=2, k=4, a=[8,4].

So, total cards of type 1: 8, type 2: 4 + 4 = 8.

Then, arranging them as [1,2,1,2,...], which is 16 cards in total.

Number of subarrays of length 2: 15.

Each subarray is [1,2] or [2,1], which are both permutations of [1,2].

Hence, score is 15.

Alternatively, if we don't buy any new cards of type 2, we have 8 type 1 and 4 type 2.

Arranging them in the best way, say [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,1], which has 7 subarrays [1,2] and some [2,1], totaling less than 15.

Hence, buying 4 type 2 cards is better.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says buying 4 type 2 cards and arranging [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], which has 15 subarrays, each being [1,2] or [2,1], all of which are permutations of [1,2].

So, in this case, the maximum score is achieved by balancing the number of type 1 and type 2 cards.

Generalizing, for n=2, to maximize the number of valid subarrays of length 2, we need to maximize the number of positions where two consecutive cards are different.

This can be achieved by alternating the cards as much as possible.

To do that, we need to have the counts of type 1 and type 2 cards as equal as possible.

Given that, in the second test case, initially, a=[8,4].

We can buy 4 type 2 cards to make a=[8,8], then arrange as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], which gives 15 valid subarrays.

Alternatively, if we buy fewer or more type 2 cards, we might not achieve this balance.

Wait, but if we buy more type 2 cards, say k=4, but buy, say, 2 type 1 and 2 type 2, making a=[10,6], then arranging as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2,1], which has 16 cards and 15 subarrays, still 15 valid subarrays.

Wait, but in this case, it's the same as [8,8] giving 15 subarrays.

So, in this specific case, different choices lead to the same number of subarrays.

But perhaps not always.

Wait, in the third test case:

3 4

6 1 8

Output: 15

So, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8]

We need to buy 4 new cards, which can be any combination of types 1,2,3.

We need to arrange all cards to maximize the number of subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of [1,2,3].

A permutation of [1,2,3] can be any arrangement where all three numbers are present, i.e., [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

To maximize the number of such subarrays, we need to maximize the number of positions where any three consecutive cards form one of these permutations.

This seems more complex than the n=2 case.

Perhaps a general approach is needed.

Let me consider the general case.

Given n, k, and a_i for i=1 to n.

I can buy up to k new cards, each of any type from 1 to n.

Then, I arrange all cards (original and bought) in a line and count the number of subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

I need to maximize this count.

First, I need to understand what determines if a subarray of length n is a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

It means that in those n consecutive positions, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

So, in other words, in any window of n consecutive cards, no number should be repeated.

To maximize the number of such windows, I need to arrange the cards in a way that as many n-consecutive subsequences as possible have all distinct numbers.

Given that, perhaps the idea is to create a sequence where the numbers are as uniformly distributed as possible, ensuring that in every window of size n, no number repeats.

But I can also buy new cards to adjust the frequencies.

Wait, but I need to maximize the number of windows that satisfy the condition.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array of total length L, where L = sum of a_i + k.

Then, the number of subarrays of length n is L - n + 1.

I need to maximize how many of these subarrays have all elements distinct.

To maximize this, I need to minimize the number of overlapping violations, i.e., positions where some number repeats within a window.

But this seems tricky.

Another approach: think about the number of windows where all elements are distinct.

This can be calculated by sliding a window of size n and checking if all elements are unique.

To maximize this, I need to arrange the cards so that as many windows as possible have no duplicates.

But arranging a large sequence optimally seems complicated.

Perhaps there's a better mathematical approach.

Let me consider the minimal frequency.

Suppose m is the minimal frequency among a_i.

Then, I can have at least m windows where each number appears at least once.

But I need to think in terms of arranging the cards to maximize the number of valid windows.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of possible permutations.

Given that, for each window of size n, there are n! possible permutations of [1,2,...,n].

But I need to maximize the number of windows that match any of these permutations.

But n! is just the number of permutations, but in terms of counting the number of windows that are permutations, it's equivalent to counting the number of windows with all unique elements.

So, n! is not directly relevant here, except that each valid window corresponds to n! possible permutations.

Wait, no.

Actually, each valid window corresponds to exactly one permutation, but since there are n! permutations, and we're just counting the number of windows that are any permutation of [1,2,...,n], it's sufficient to count the number of windows with all unique elements.

So, n! doesn't directly come into play in counting the number of valid windows.

Wait, but in the code provided, there's a math.factorial(n), which suggests that it might be considering n! in some way.

I need to understand why.

Let me look at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

m = min(a)

ans = 0

if k >= n * m:

ans = math.factorial(n)

else:

k -= n * m

for i in range(n):

a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])

k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])

ans = a[0]

for i in range(1, n):

ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]

print(ans)

So, in this code, it first computes m as the minimum of a_i.

Then, if k >= n * m, it sets ans to n!.

Otherwise, it adjusts a_i by distributing k among them in some way and then computes ans as a product of differences of a_i.

This seems unclear to me.

Let me try to understand.

First, it computes m = min(a_i).

Then, if k >= n * m, it sets ans to n!.

Why n!?

In the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1], m=1.

k >= n*m => 10 >= 1*1, which is true, so ans = 1! = 1.

But in the output, it's 11.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1], output=11.

But according to this code, ans would be 1, which doesn't match the output.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back, the code prints ans, but in the first test case, it should be 11, not 1.

So, perhaps this code is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says "the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 100)", and then each test case has two lines: n k and then a_i.

But in the example input, there are 8 test cases.

Looking at the first test case:

1 10

1

Output: 11

But according to the code, for n=1, k=10, a=[1], m=1.

If k >= n*m, which is 10 >= 1*1, then ans = math.factorial(1) = 1, but the output should be 11.

So, this suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

m = min(a)

ans = 0

if k >= n * m:

ans = math.factorial(n)

else:

k -= n * m

for i in range(n):

a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])

k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])

ans = a[0]

for i in range(1, n):

ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]

print(ans)

In the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1], m=1.

k >= n*m => 10 >= 1*1, which is true, so ans = math.factorial(1) = 1.

But according to the sample output, it should be 11.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (including 11 single 1's), which contains 11 subarrays consisting of a permutation of [1]."

So, for n=1, the score is simply the total number of cards, which is a_1 + k = 1 + 10 = 11.

But according to the code, it sets ans = math.factorial(1) = 1, which is wrong.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
