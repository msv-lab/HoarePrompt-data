Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n+1. But he doesn't like waiting, so he wants to bribe people to move up in the queue, aiming to be among the first m people.

Each person in the queue has two values: a_i and b_i. If Kirill wants to swap places with someone ahead of him (position j < i), he has to pay a_j coins to that person. Additionally, for everyone between positions j and i, he has to pay b_k coins to each of them.

My task is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people.

First, I need to understand the operations Kirill can perform. He can choose any position j ahead of him (j < i) and swap places with that person, paying a_j to that person and b_k to everyone between j and i.

I need to model this in a way that allows me to compute the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first m positions.

Let me consider the queue positions from 1 to n, with Kirill initially at position n+1. He wants to be in one of the positions from 1 to m.

I need to find a sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost and results in Kirill being in one of the first m positions.

This sounds like a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges representing the possible swaps, with costs associated.

But maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Let's consider that Kirill can perform these swaps any number of times. So, he can potentially move up the queue step by step, choosing the most cost-effective way at each step.

I need to find the minimum cost path from position n+1 to any position from 1 to m.

Wait, but modeling it as a graph with n+1 nodes might not be efficient, especially since n can be up to 200,000.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me try to think differently. Suppose Kirill wants to reach position p, where 1 ≤ p ≤ m. What would be the cost to reach position p?

To reach position p, Kirill needs to perform a series of swaps to move from n+1 to p.

Each swap involves choosing some j < i and paying a_j plus b_k for each k between j and i.

Wait, but in the problem, it says he can choose any j < i and exchange places with j, paying a_j and for each k between j and i, paying b_k.

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + sum of b_k for j < k < i.

I need to find the minimal total cost to reach any position <= m.

This seems like a classic optimization problem, perhaps solvable with dynamic programming.

Let me define dp[i], which represents the minimum cost for Kirill to reach position i.

He starts at position n+1, so dp[n+1] = 0.

He wants to compute dp[p] for p from 1 to m, and then take the minimum among those dp[p].

Wait, but he starts at position n+1, and wants to reach positions from 1 to m.

But in the code provided, it seems to handle positions from 0 to n-1, considering na_frente = n-1, and pos_final = m-1, since it's 0-indexed.

Wait, the code uses na_frente -=1 and pos_final -=1, so it's considering 0-based indexing.

Let me make sure about the indexing.

In the problem, positions are from 1 to n, with Kirill starting at n+1.

In the code, it's using 0-based indexing, so positions are from 0 to n, with Kirill starting at position na_frente = n-1, which seems off.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the indexing.

Let's assume positions are 1 to n, with Kirill starting at n+1.

In the code, na_frente = n-1, which would be position n in 1-based indexing.

Wait, perhaps the code is using 0-based indexing internally.

I need to make sure about the indexing to understand the code properly.

Assuming positions are 0 to n, with Kirill starting at position n.

He wants to reach positions from 1 to m.

In the code, na_frente -=1 and pos_final -=1, so it's adjusting for 0-based indexing.

Ok, with that in mind, let's look at the code.

The function func() reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and m, then reads two lists a and b of size n.

It sets na_frente -=1 and pos_final -=1 for 0-based indexing.

Then it initializes total = 0 and best = infinity.

Then it loops from v = na_frente down to 0.

In each iteration, if v <= pos_final, it checks if best > total + a[v], and updates best if so.

Then, it checks if a[v] < b[v]:

if yes, total += a[v]

else, total += b[v]

Otherwise, for v > pos_final, it does the same check a[v] < b[v] and adds the appropriate cost to total.

Finally, it prints best.

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me try to understand.

It seems like it's trying to compute the minimal cost to reach any position <= pos_final.

It iterates from the starting position na_frente down to 0.

For each position v, if v <= pos_final, it considers the cost to reach v as total + a[v], and keeps the minimum of such costs in best.

Then, it decides whether to add a[v] or b[v] to the total, depending on which is smaller.

But I'm not entirely sure if this is correct.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose Kirill is at position i, and he wants to move to position j < i.

The cost for this move is a_j + sum of b_k for j < k < i.

He can perform this operation multiple times, and he wants to minimize the total cost to reach position <= m.

This seems like a shortest path problem, where each position is a node, and there are directed edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But with n up to 2e5, a standard shortest path algorithm would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider that Kirill can jump from his current position to any position ahead, paying the corresponding cost.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach position <= m.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a prefix minimum cost computation, considering the costs a_i and b_i appropriately.

Let me consider that Kirill starts at position n+1, and he can perform swaps to move to any position j < i, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach position <= m.

Let me think about the cumulative sum of b_k.

If Kirill moves from position i to j, he pays a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

If he performs multiple such moves, the total cost needs to be minimized.

This seems complex, but maybe there's a way to compute the minimal cost efficiently.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to either pay a_j to swap with j, or pay sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 to pass through positions j+1 to i-1.

Wait, no, he has to pay both a_j and sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 to swap to j.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from 1 to i.

Then, sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

Wait, but b_k is defined for k from 1 to n, and in 0-based indexing, from 0 to n-1.

I need to be careful with the indices.

Let me assume 0-based indexing for simplicity.

So, positions are from 0 to n, with Kirill starting at position n.

He wants to reach positions from 0 to m-1.

Define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from 0 to i-1.

Then, sum of b_k from j to i-1 is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j].

Wait, actually, if prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from 0 to i-1, then sum from j to i-1 is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j].

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j]).

Therefore, total cost to reach j from i is a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j].

Now, if I consider dp[i], the minimal cost to reach position i, then dp[j] = min over all k < j of (dp[k] + a_k + prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[k]).

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think differently.

If Kirill is at position i, and he wants to swap with position j < i, the cost is a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j].

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j]).

This can be rearranged as dp[i] = prefix_b[i] + min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j).

This looks like dp[i] = prefix_b[i] + min{(dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j)} for j < i.

So, if I keep track of the minimum of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j) for j < i, then dp[i] can be computed efficiently.

I can compute dp[i] for all i from 0 to n, and then take the minimum dp[p] for p from 0 to m-1.

This seems feasible.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, compute prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from 0 to i-1.

Initialize dp[0] = 0, since to reach position 0 from n, if possible, with some cost.

Wait, but Kirill starts at position n, so dp[n] = 0.

Wait, no.

Wait, actually, Kirill starts at position n, so dp[n] = 0.

He wants to reach positions from 0 to m-1.

So, I need to compute dp[i] for i from 0 to n, with dp[n] = 0.

But the recurrence is dp[i] = prefix_b[i] + min over j > i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j] + a_j).

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I need to reverse the direction.

Let me think again.

If Kirill starts at position n, and wants to reach positions <= m-1, then he needs to perform swaps to move left in the queue.

So, he can swap from i to j < i, paying a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j].

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate from n down to 0, computing dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from n.

So, dp[n] = 0.

For each i from n-1 down to 0, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_i + prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i]).

Wait, no.

Wait, if he swaps from j to i, paying a_i + prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i].

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that Kirill is moving from position n to positions <= m-1.

At each step, he can choose to swap with some j < i, paying a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j].

But this seems too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the total cost to move from n to p is the sum of a_j for each swap, plus the sum of b_k for all positions k that are passed through.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion isn't the right way.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose a sequence of swaps to reach position p, and I need to find the minimal cost among all possible sequences.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to find a way to compute the minimal cost efficiently, maybe using prefix sums and keeping track of some minimum value.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to iterate from na_frente down to 0, keeping a running total and updating the best value when it reaches positions <= pos_final.

In each step, it decides whether to add a[v] or b[v] to the total, depending on which is smaller.

This seems simplistic and might not account for the sum of b_k between positions correctly.

I suspect that the code might be incorrect, but I need to verify it with the sample input.

Let me look at the first sample input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

According to the code, na_frente = 4-1=3, pos_final=2-1=1

Then, it iterates v from 3 down to 0:

v=3:

v > pos_final (1), so:

if a[3] < b[3]: total += a[3] else total += b[3]

a[3]=9, b[3]=5, so total +=5, total=5

v=2:

v > pos_final (1), same as above:

a[2]=6, b[2]=8, a[2] < b[2], so total +=6, total=11

v=1:

v <= pos_final (1), so:

if best > total + a[1], which is if best > 11 + 3=14, assume best=inf, so best=14

then, a[1] < b[1]: 3 < 3 is False, so total += b[1], total=11+3=14

v=0:

v <= pos_final (1), so:

if best > total + a[0], which is if best >14 +7=21, but best=14, so no change

then, a[0] < b[0]: 7 <4 is False, so total += b[0], total=14+4=18

Then, it prints best, which is 14.

According to the sample output, the answer is 14, which matches.

Let me check another sample input:

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

na_frente=6-1=5, pos_final=2-1=1

Iterate v from 5 down to 0:

v=5:

v >1, a[5]=3 < b[5]=1 is False, so total +=1, total=1

v=4:

v >1, a[4]=8 < b[4]=4 is False, so total +=4, total=5

v=3:

v >1, a[3]=1 < b[3]=1 is not strictly less, so total +=1, total=6

v=2:

v >1, a[2]=7 < b[2]=8 is True, so total +=7, total=13

v=1:

v <=1, so if best > total + a[1]=13+9=22, assume best=inf, so best=22

then, a[1]=9 < b[1]=8 is False, so total +=8, total=21

v=0:

v <=1, so if best > total + a[0]=21+6=27, but best=22, so no change

then, a[0]=6 < b[0]=5 is False, so total +=5, total=26

Then, it prints best, which is 22, matching the sample output.

Another sample input:

7 7

7 2 9 2 6 5 9

9 1 10 7 1 4 9

na_frente=7-1=6, pos_final=7-1=6

Iterate v from 6 down to 0:

v=6:

v >6 is False, so v <=6, so:

if best > total + a[6]=0+9=9, best=9

then, a[6]=9 < b[6]=9 is not True, so total +=9, total=9

v=5:

v <=6, so:

if best > total + a[5]=9+5=14, which is >9, so no change

then, a[5]=5 < b[5]=4 is False, so total +=4, total=13

v=4:

v <=6, so:

if best > total + a[4]=13+6=19, >9, no change

then, a[4]=6 < b[4]=1 is False, so total +=1, total=14

v=3:

v <=6, so:

if best > total + a[3]=14+2=16, >9, no change

then, a[3]=2 < b[3]=7 is True, so total +=2, total=16

v=2:

v <=6, so:

if best > total + a[2]=16+9=25, >9, no change

then, a[2]=9 < b[2]=10 is True, so total +=9, total=25

v=1:

v <=6, so:

if best > total + a[1]=25+2=27, >9, no change

then, a[1]=2 < b[1]=1 is False, so total +=1, total=26

v=0:

v <=6, so:

if best > total + a[0]=26+7=33, >9, no change

then, a[0]=7 < b[0]=9 is True, so total +=7, total=33

Then, it prints best, which is 9, matching the sample output.

Last sample input:

2 1

2 3

1 1

na_frente=2-1=1, pos_final=1-1=0

Iterate v from1 down to0:

v=1:

v >0 is True, so:

a[1]=3 < b[1]=1 is False, so total +=1, total=1

v=0:

v <=0, so:

if best > total + a[0]=1+2=3, best=3

then, a[0]=2 < b[0]=1 is False, so total +=1, total=2

Then, it prints best, which is3, matching the sample output.

So, in all sample inputs, the code produces the correct output.

But I still need to verify if the logic is sound.

Let me try to understand the logic in the code.

It seems to iterate from the starting position na_frente down to0, keeping a running total cost, and updating the best cost when it reaches positions <= pos_final.

In each step, it decides whether to add a[v] or b[v] to the total, depending on which is smaller.

But I'm not sure if this accounts for the sum of b_k between positions correctly.

Wait, perhaps a[v] represents the cost to swap directly to v, and b[v] represents the cost to pass through v.

But I need to ensure that the sum of b_k for k between j and i is correctly accounted for.

I think the code might be missing something, but the sample inputs are passing.

Let me try to construct a custom test case to see if the code fails.

Suppose n=3, m=1

a = [1, 1000, 1000]

b = [1, 1, 1]

So, positions are 0,1,2, with Kirill starting at position3.

He wants to reach position0.

Option1: swap directly to0, paying a[0]=1 + sum of b_k from0 to2, which is1 +1 +1=3, total cost=1+3=4.

Option2: swap to1, paying a[1]=1000 + sum of b_k from1 to2=1+1=2, total=1002.

Then swap from1 to0, paying a[0]=1 + sum of b_k from0 to0=1, total=1+1=2, plus previous cost=1004.

Option3: swap to2, paying a[2]=1000 + sum of b_k from2 to2=1, total=1001.

Then swap from2 to1, paying a[1]=1000 + sum of b_k from1 to1=1, total=1001, plus previous cost=1001+1001=2002.

Then swap from1 to0, paying a[0]=1 + sum of b_k from0 to0=1, total=2, plus previous cost=2004.

So, the minimal cost is4.

Let's see what the code does.

na_frente=3-1=2, pos_final=1-1=0

Iterate v from2 down to0:

v=2:

v >0, a[2]=1000 < b[2]=1 is False, so total +=1, total=1

v=1:

v >0, a[1]=1000 < b[1]=1 is False, so total +=1, total=2

v=0:

v <=0, so if best > total + a[0]=2+1=3, best=3

then, a[0]=1 < b[0]=1 is not strictly less, so total +=1, total=3

Then, it prints best=3, which is less than the actual minimal cost of4.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the minimal cost should be4, but the code outputs3.

So, the code is wrong.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill has to spend to reach among the first m positions in a queue of n people.

### Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Kirill starts at position n+1.
   - He can swap with anyone ahead (position j < i) by paying a_j and b_k for each k between j and i.

2. **Insight**:
   - We need to find the minimal cost for Kirill to reach any of the first m positions.
   - This can be modeled using dynamic programming where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach position i.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use prefix sums to efficiently compute the sum of b_k for any range.
   - Maintain a sliding window minimum to avoid O(n^2) computations.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Compute prefix sums for the b array.
   - Iterate from position n down to 0, computing the cost to reach each position using the prefix sums and maintaining the minimum cost found so far.

            dp[i] = prefix_b[i] + min_val
            # Update min_val for next iterations
            # min_val = min(min_val, dp[i+1] - prefix_b[i+1] + a[i])
            if i + 1 < n + 1:
                candidate = dp[i+1] - prefix_b[i+1] + a[i]
                if candidate < min_val:
                    min_val = candidate
        # Find the minimum dp[p] for p from 0 to m-1
        ans = min(dp[p] for p in range(m))
        outputs.append(str(ans))
    print('\n'.join(outputs))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
   - Parse the number of test cases.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Compute prefix sums for the array b to quickly calculate the sum of b_k for any range.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Initialize `dp` array where `dp[i]` will store the minimum cost to reach position i.
   - Start from the end of the queue and iterate backwards, updating the dp values based on the minimal cost found so far.

4. **Minimizing Cost**:
   - Track the minimum value needed to update dp[i] efficiently using a sliding minimum approach.
   - Ensure that for each position, the minimal previous cost plus the necessary b sums are considered.

5. **Output Results**:
   - For each test case, compute and store the minimum dp value for the first m positions.
   - Print the results for all test cases.

This approach ensures that we handle the problem efficiently within the constraints, achieving the desired time complexity.
