Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to choose n cells in an n by n grid. These cells are specified by their coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n. The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these chosen cells.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan distance is. It's the sum of the absolute differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of two points. So, for cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

The problem gives some examples for n=2, n=3, n=4, n=5, and n=6, showing specific arrangements of cells and the resulting set of distinct Manhattan distances. From these examples, it seems like there's a pattern or strategy to choose the cells in a way that maximizes the variety of distances.

Looking at the first example for n=2:

- Cells: (1,1) and (1,2)

- Distances: |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, |1-1| + |2-2| = 0, |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- So, H = {0, 1}, which has a size of 2.

It mentions that this is the maximum possible for n=2.

For n=3:

- Cells: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- Distances: various combinations leading to H = {0,1,2,3}, size 4.

For n=4, n=5, and n=6, similar arrangements are shown.

Now, I need to find a general way to choose n cells for any given n between 2 and 1000, such that the number of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to have a specific strategy:

- For each test case:

- Read n.

- Always print (1,1) and (1,2).

- Then, for i from 3 to n, print (i,i).

So, for n=2:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

For n=3:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

- (3,3)

For n=4:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

- (3,3)

- (4,4)

And so on.

I need to verify if this strategy maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances for any n.

Let me try to analyze this.

First, consider the cells chosen:

- The first two cells are always (1,1) and (1,2).

- The remaining cells are (i,i) for i from 3 to n.

So, in general, the chosen cells are:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

- (3,3)

- (4,4)

- ...

- (n,n)

Now, let's think about the Manhattan distances between these cells.

Consider distances between:

1. (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

2. (1,1) and (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4

3. (1,1) and (4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

...

n. (1,1) and (n,n): |1-n| + |1-n| = 2*(n-1)

Similarly:

- (1,2) and (3,3): |1-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3

- (1,2) and (4,4): |1-4| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5

...

- (1,2) and (n,n): |1-n| + |2-n| = (n-1) + (n-2) = 2n - 3

Then, distances between cells on the diagonal:

- (3,3) and (4,4): |3-4| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2

- (3,3) and (5,5): |3-5| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4

...

- (i,i) and (j,j): |i-j| + |i-j| = 2*|i-j|

So, the distances between diagonal cells are even numbers starting from 2.

Now, let's list all the distances for a specific n.

Take n=4:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (1,2)-(3,3): 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 5

- (3,3)-(4,4): 2

So, H = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6.

Seems good.

Compare to the example for n=4 in the problem, which has H with 6 elements.

Looks consistent.

Now, for n=3:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,2)-(3,3): 3

- H = {1,3,4}, size 3.

Wait, but in the example for n=3, H has size 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some distances.

Wait, in n=3, the example chooses (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- Distances:

- (2,1)-(2,3): 2

- (2,1)-(3,1): 1

- (2,3)-(3,1): 3

- Plus the zeros for the same cell distances.

Wait, but in my approach, for n=3, choosing (1,1), (1,2), (3,3):

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,2)-(3,3): 3

- Plus the zeros.

So, H = {0,1,3,4}, size 4.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was size 3, but actually it's size 4.

So, it matches the example's H size.

Okay, seems fine.

Now, for n=5:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): 8

- (1,2)-(3,3): 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): 7

- (3,3)-(4,4): 2

- (3,3)-(5,5): 4

- (4,4)-(5,5): 2

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9.

Seems comprehensive.

Comparing to the example for n=5, which has H with 9 elements.

Again, consistent.

Similarly, for n=6:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): 8

- (1,1)-(6,6): 10

- (1,2)-(3,3): 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): 7

- (1,2)-(6,6): 9

- (3,3)-(4,4): 2

- (3,3)-(5,5): 4

- (3,3)-(6,6): 6

- (4,4)-(5,5): 2

- (4,4)-(6,6): 4

- (5,5)-(6,6): 2

So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, size 11.

Again, matches the example's H size for n=6.

So, this strategy seems to be working.

But I need to confirm if this is indeed the maximum possible.

Let me think about the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances.

In an n x n grid, the possible Manhattan distances range from 0 up to 2(n-1).

- Minimum: 0 (same cell)

- Maximum: 2(n-1) (e.g., corner to opposite corner)

So, the total possible distinct distances is 2(n-1) + 1 = 2n - 1.

But, in the examples:

- n=2: H has size 2 ({0,1}), which is less than 2*2 -1 = 3.

- n=3: H has size 4, 2*3 -1 =5.

- n=4: H has size 6, 2*4 -1=7.

- n=5: H has size 9, 2*5 -1=9.

- n=6: H has size 11, 2*6 -1=11.

Wait, for n=5 and n=6, the H size matches 2n -1.

But for n=2,3,4, it's less.

Wait, perhaps for n>=5, it's possible to achieve 2n -1 distinct distances.

But for smaller n, it's not possible.

Looking back at n=2:

- Maximum possible distinct distances: 2*2 -1=3.

- But in the example, H has size 2.

- Is it possible to get 3 distinct distances for n=2?

Let's see:

- Cells: (1,1), (1,2)

- Distances: 0,0,1

- H={0,1}, size 2.

- Can I choose different cells to get a third distinct distance?

Suppose I choose (1,1) and (2,2):

- Distances: |1-1|+|1-1|=0, |1-2|+|1-2|=2, |2-2|+|2-2|=0

- H={0,2}, still size 2.

Or (1,1) and (2,1):

- Distances: 0,1,0

- H={0,1}, size 2.

Seems like for n=2, the maximum H size is 2, not 3.

So, perhaps the maximum number of distinct distances is not always 2n -1.

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of unique sums of |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| that can be achieved with n cells.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or known result about the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for n points in an n x n grid.

Alternatively, perhaps for n >=5, it's possible to achieve 2n -1 distinct distances, but for smaller n, it's not possible.

Given that for n=5 and n=6, the H size matches 2n -1, but for n=2,3,4, it's less.

Wait, in the examples:

- n=2: H size=2, 2n -1=3 → can't achieve.

- n=3: H size=4, 2n -1=5 → can't achieve.

- n=4: H size=6, 2n -1=7 → can't achieve.

- n=5: H size=9, 2n -1=9 → achieved.

- n=6: H size=11, 2n -1=11 → achieved.

So, perhaps for n >=5, it's possible to achieve 2n -1 distinct distances, but for n=2,3,4, it's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different pattern.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to aim for achieving as many distinct distances as possible by choosing cells in a specific way.

Let me see for n=2:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2)

- Distances: 0,0,1 → H={0,1}, size 2.

- Maximum possible seems to be 2.

For n=3:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

- Distances: 0,1,3,4 → H={0,1,3,4}, size 4.

- 2n -1=5, but can't achieve it.

Is it possible to get 5 distinct distances for n=3?

Let me try choosing different cells.

Suppose choose (1,1), (2,2), (3,3):

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,2): |1-2| + |1-2| = 2

- (1,1)-(3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 4

- (2,2)-(3,3): |2-3| + |2-3| = 2

- Plus zeros.

- H={0,2,4}, size 3.

- Which is less than the previous choice of (1,1), (1,2), (3,3) giving size 4.

So, previous choice is better.

Another choice: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,1): 1

- (1,1)-(3,1): 2

- (2,1)-(3,1):1

- Plus zeros.

- H={0,1,2}, size 3.

Still less than 4.

So, the initial choice seems better.

Hence, for n=3, choosing (1,1), (1,2), (3,3) gives H size 4, which seems maximal.

Similarly, for n=4, choosing (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4) gives H size 6, which is less than 2n -1=7.

Is it possible to get 7 distinct distances for n=4?

Let me try adding another cell.

Wait, n=4 has 4 cells.

In the chosen strategy, H size is 6.

Can I get 7?

Maybe choose different cells.

For example, choose (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), (4,4).

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(2,3):2

- (1,1)-(4,4):6

- (1,2)-(2,3):2

- (1,2)-(4,4):5

- (2,3)-(4,4):3

- H={0,1,2,3,5,6}, size 6.

Still 6.

Another choice: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,2):2

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,1)-(4,4):6

- (2,2)-(3,3):2

- (2,2)-(4,4):4

- (3,3)-(4,4):2

- H={0,2,4,6}, size 4.

Worse than previous.

So, seems like choosing (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4) gives the maximum H size of 6 for n=4.

Hence, for n=4, maximum H size is 6, which is less than 2n -1=7.

But for n=5 and n=6, H size matches 2n -1.

So, perhaps for n >=5, it's possible to achieve 2n -1 distinct distances.

Looking at n=5:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2):1

- (1,1)-(3,3):4

- (1,1)-(4,4):6

- (1,1)-(5,5):8

- (1,2)-(3,3):3

- (1,2)-(4,4):5

- (1,2)-(5,5):7

- (3,3)-(4,4):2

- (3,3)-(5,5):4

- (4,4)-(5,5):2

- H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9, which is 2*5 -1=9.

Similarly for n=6:

- H size=11, which is 2*6 -1=11.

So, for n>=5, it's possible to achieve 2n -1 distinct distances.

But for n=2,3,4, it's not possible.

Hence, perhaps there's a pattern or formula based on n.

But in the provided program, it seems to aim for choosing (1,1), (1,2), and then (i,i) for i from 3 to n.

This seems to work for n>=5 to achieve 2n -1 distinct distances.

But for n=2,3,4, it achieves the maximum possible, which is less than 2n -1.

So, perhaps this strategy is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better strategy for n>=5 to achieve 2n -1 distinct distances.

But in the provided program, for n=2,3,4,5,6, it seems to achieve the maximum possible H size as per the examples.

Hence, I think the program is correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to select `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of selected cells is maximized.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Manhattan Distance**: The Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.
2. **Strategy for Selecting Cells**:
   - Always select the cell `(1,1)`.
   - Select the cell `(1,2)`.
   - For the remaining cells, select `(i,i)` for `i` from 3 to `n`.

This strategy ensures a good spread of distances, maximizing the number of unique Manhattan distances.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: Read the input values, determining the number of test cases `t` and the grid size `n` for each test case.
2. **Selecting Cells**:
   - For each test case, print the coordinates of the cells as per the strategy:
     - Always choose `(1,1)` and `(1,2)`.
     - For each `i` from 3 to `n`, choose `(i,i)`.
3. **Maximizing Distinct Distances**: This selection ensures a variety in the Manhattan distances:
   - Distances between `(1,1)` and `(1,2)` is `1`.
   - Distances between `(1,1)` and `(i,i)` for `i >= 3` are `2*(i-1)`.
   - Distances between `(1,2)` and `(i,i)` for `i >= 3` are `(i-1) + (i-2)`.
   - Distances between `(i,i)` and `(j,j)` for `i != j` are `2*|i - j|`.

This combination helps in achieving a maximum number of distinct distances, as observed in the provided examples.

## Correctness
**True**
