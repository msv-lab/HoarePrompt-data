Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game on a checkered board where Alice and Bob move their chips based on specific rules, and I need to determine who wins if both play optimally. The board has h rows and w columns, and each player starts at a given position. Alice moves down or diagonally down, while Bob moves up or diagonally up. The goal is to land on the opponent's chip to win, and if neither can move, it's a draw.

First, I need to understand the movement rules clearly. Alice can move:

- Down: (x_a + 1, y_a)

- Down-right: (x_a + 1, y_a + 1)

- Down-left: (x_a + 1, y_a - 1)

Bob can move:

- Up: (x_b - 1, y_b)

- Up-right: (x_b - 1, y_b + 1)

- Up-left: (x_b - 1, y_b - 1)

They can't move beyond the board boundaries. The game ends either when one player captures the other's chip or when a player can't make a move.

Given that both play optimally, I need to figure out the best strategy for each player and determine the outcome.

Let me consider the board as a grid where rows are numbered from 1 to h (top to bottom) and columns from 1 to w (left to right).

First, I should note the initial positions:

- Alice: (x_a, y_a)

- Bob: (x_b, y_b)

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6

- 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9

- The chips start at different positions.

- There are up to 10^4 test cases, with the sum of h over all test cases ≤ 10^6.

Given the large constraints, especially w up to 10^9, I need an efficient way to compute the result without iterating over the board.

I need to find a way to model their movements and determine if Alice can reach Bob or vice versa before one of them is stuck.

Let me think about the movement patterns.

Alice moves down or diagonally down, which means her x-coordinate increases by 1 each move, and her y-coordinate can stay the same or change by ±1.

Similarly, Bob moves up or diagonally up, decreasing his x-coordinate by 1 each move, with y-coordinate staying the same or changing by ±1.

Since Alice moves down and Bob moves up, their x-coordinates are moving towards each other if x_a < x_b, which is likely the case since Alice starts above Bob in most scenarios.

Wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify which one is above or below; it just says Alice moves down and Bob moves up.

But in the example, Alice is at (2,2) and Bob at (5,3), so Alice is above Bob.

So generally, Alice is trying to move down towards Bob, and Bob is moving up towards Alice.

The game is turn-based, with Alice starting first.

I need to see if Alice can reach Bob's position or vice versa before one of them can't move.

Also, if they land on the same cell at the same time, I need to see who captures whom.

Wait, no: the rule is that a player wins immediately if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the other player's chip.

So, if Alice moves to Bob's current position, she wins, and similarly if Bob moves to Alice's position, he wins.

If Alice can't move (she's at the bottom row, x_a = h), or Bob can't move (x_b = 1), the game ends in a draw.

Given that, I need to model their possible paths and see who can reach the other first.

Given the large board sizes, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Maybe I can think in terms of meeting points or something.

Let me consider the relative positions.

Let me define the difference in rows: d_x = x_b - x_a

And the difference in columns: d_y = y_b - y_a

I need to see how their movements affect these differences.

Alice can change her x by +1 and y by -1, 0, or +1.

Bob can change his x by -1 and y by -1, 0, or +1.

So, in each turn, the difference in x decreases by 2 because Alice increases x by 1 and Bob decreases x by 1.

Similarly, the difference in y can change by -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2, depending on their choices.

Wait, but they move alternately: Alice moves first, then Bob, and so on.

So, after Alice's move, the difference in x is reduced by 1, and after Bob's move, it's reduced by another 1, so overall d_x decreases by 2 per full turn.

Similarly, d_y can change by up to ±2 per full turn, depending on their choices.

Wait, no: Alice can change y by ±1 or 0, and Bob can change y by ±1 or 0, so overall, in a full turn (Alice and Bob), d_y can change by -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2.

But it's not just the change in d_y; it's the specific paths they take.

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the number of moves Alice and Bob can make.

Alice can make at most h - x_a moves down.

Bob can make at most x_b - 1 moves up.

Wait, but they take turns, and Alice starts.

So, the number of full turns possible is min(h - x_a, x_b - 1).

Because after Alice moves h - x_a times, she can't move further, and after Bob moves x_b - 1 times, he can't move further.

So, the game can last at most min(h - x_a, x_b - 1) full turns.

After that, one of them can't move anymore.

Now, during these turns, they are trying to minimize or maximize the y-distance, depending on who is trying to catch the other.

This seems like a pursuit-evasion game.

I need to see if Alice can catch Bob before she can't move, or vice versa.

Alternatively, if neither can catch the other before one of them is stuck, it's a draw.

I need to find a way to calculate this efficiently.

Maybe I can model it as a race where Alice is trying to minimize the y-distance while Bob is trying to maximize it.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the y-difference and see if Alice can bridge that difference before she runs out of moves.

Let me formalize it.

Let d_x = x_b - x_a initially.

This is the number of rows between them.

Each full turn (Alice and Bob move once), the d_x decreases by 2.

So, after k full turns, d_x becomes d_x - 2k.

Alice can catch Bob if, within k turns where d_x - 2k >= 0, the y-difference is within Alice's reach.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the y-difference and the number of moves.

Let d_y = |y_a - y_b| initially.

Alice can change her y by up to 1 per move, and Bob can change his y by up to 1 per move.

So, in each full turn, the y-difference can change by -2 (if they both move towards each other diagonally), -1, 0, 1, or 2.

Wait, Alice moves down and adjusts y by -1, 0, or +1.

Bob moves up and adjusts y by -1, 0, or +1.

So, in a full turn, the y-difference can decrease by up to 2 (if both move towards each other diagonally in y).

Or increase by up to 2 (if both move away from each other diagonally in y).

Or stay the same, or change by 1 or -1.

So, in each full turn, d_y can change by -2 to +2.

Now, I need to see if Alice can make d_y <= 0 before she runs out of moves.

Similarly, Bob can try to make d_y != 0 for as long as possible.

Wait, but Bob wins if he can land on Alice's position before Alice can land on his.

But Alice moves first, so she has an advantage.

Wait, no: Alice moves first, then Bob, then Alice, and so on.

I need to model this carefully.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of moves Alice and Bob can make.

Let me define:

- Alice can make m_a = h - x_a moves.

- Bob can make m_b = x_b - 1 moves.

The game ends when either Alice can't move (x_a = h) or Bob can't move (x_b = 1), or one captures the other.

Given that, the maximum number of full turns is min(m_a, m_b).

During these turns, Alice and Bob adjust their y-positions.

I need to see if, within min(m_a, m_b) turns, Alice can make y_a = y_b before Bob can make y_b = y_a.

Wait, but they can both try to capture each other.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can consider the y-difference and see if Alice can bridge it before she runs out of moves.

Let me consider d_y = |y_a - y_b|.

Each turn, the y-difference can decrease by up to 2 (if both move towards each other).

So, in k turns, the y-difference can be reduced by up to 2k.

If d_y - 2k <= 0, then Alice can catch Bob in k turns.

But Alice can also choose to minimize d_y, while Bob tries to maximize it.

Wait, actually, both want to minimize the y-difference to capture the other.

But they move alternately, so their strategies interact.

This seems like a game where I need to find the minimal k for Alice to capture Bob, and see if that k is less than or equal to min(m_a, m_b).

Similarly, Bob tries to reach Alice in some number of moves.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think in terms of possible y-ranges after k moves.

Let me try to model it.

After k Alice's moves and k Bob's moves, the y-positions can be in certain ranges.

But with w up to 1e9, I need something more efficient.

Perhaps I can consider the y-difference and see if Alice can make it zero within her available moves.

Wait, let's think about the y-difference.

Initially, d_y = |y_a - y_b|.

Each time Alice moves, she can adjust her y by -1, 0, or +1.

Each time Bob moves, he can adjust his y by -1, 0, or +1.

So, in k moves by Alice and k moves by Bob, the y-difference can be reduced by up to 2k.

If d_y - 2k <= 0, then Alice can catch Bob in k moves.

But k is limited by the number of moves Alice and Bob can make.

Specifically, k <= min(m_a, m_b), where m_a = h - x_a and m_b = x_b - 1.

So, if d_y - 2 * min(m_a, m_b) <= 0, then Alice can catch Bob before either is stuck.

Otherwise, it's a draw.

Wait, but Bob can also try to catch Alice.

I need to consider both possibilities.

Wait, no. Alice moves first, so she has the initiative.

Wait, but Bob moves after Alice, so he can react to Alice's moves.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider who can reach the other first.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Calculate the minimum number of moves Alice needs to reach Bob.

- Calculate the minimum number of moves Bob needs to reach Alice.

- Compare these to the maximum number of moves they can make.

But calculating the minimum number of moves seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as a distance in terms of y.

Given that Alice can reduce the y-difference by up to 1 per move (if Bob cooperates) or up to 2 per move in a full turn.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of moves required for Alice to close the y-difference.

Let me define:

- d_y = |y_a - y_b|

- Alice can reduce d_y by up to 1 per move (if Bob moves away in y).

- Bob can reduce d_y by up to 1 per move (if Alice moves away in y).

Wait, no. Alice can adjust y by -1, 0, or +1 per move.

Bob can adjust y by -1, 0, or +1 per move.

So, in a full turn (Alice and Bob), the y-difference can be reduced by up to 2 (if both move towards each other in y).

Or increased by up to 2 (if both move away from each other in y).

Or remain the same.

So, in the worst case for Alice, Bob moves to increase d_y by 1 per turn.

Similarly, in the best case for Alice, Bob doesn't increase d_y.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the relative speeds.

If Alice can reduce the y-difference faster than Bob can increase it, she can catch him.

Otherwise, Bob can escape.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that in each full turn (Alice and Bob move once), the y-difference can change by -2 to +2.

Alice wants to minimize d_y, while Bob wants to maximize it.

So, in a game where both play optimally, Bob will try to maximize d_y, and Alice will try to minimize it.

Wait, actually, both want to minimize the y-difference to capture the other, but since they move alternately, their strategies interact.

This seems like a zero-sum game.

Maybe I can model it as Alice trying to minimize d_y and Bob trying to maximize it.

But I need to find out who can make d_y == 0 first.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider the parity of the rows.

Wait, in the code provided, there's a check based on the parity of x_a and x_b.

It checks if both x_a and x_b are even or both are odd.

This might be relevant because of the movement patterns.

Let me think about the parity.

Alice moves down or diagonally down, which changes x by +1 and y by -1, 0, or +1.

Similarly, Bob moves up or diagonally up.

So, after each move, the parity of x changes for both players.

Wait, x increases by 1 for Alice and decreases by 1 for Bob, so the parity of x alternates with each move.

This might be useful.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the row where they meet.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1:

h = 6, w = 5, x_a = 2, y_a = 2, x_b = 5, y_b = 3

From the example, Alice can reach Bob in certain moves.

Case 2:

h = 4, w = 1, x_a = 2, y_a = 1, x_b = 4, y_b = 1

Here, y is always 1, so it's a straight line.

Alice can reach Bob in 2 moves, Bob can reach Alice in 3 moves, so Alice wins.

Case 3:

h = 1, w = 4, x_a = 1, y_a = 3, x_b = 1, y_b = 1

Here, Alice can't move down anymore, so it's a draw.

Case 4:

h = 5, w = 5, x_a = 1, y_a = 4, x_b = 5, y_b = 2

Alice needs to reach Bob before Bob reaches the top.

Case 5:

h = 4, w = 4, x_a = 1, y_a = 1, x_b = 4, y_b = 4

Alice needs to reach Bob before Bob reaches the top.

Case 6:

h = 10, w = 10, x_a = 1, y_a = 6, x_b = 10, y_b = 8

Alice needs to reach Bob before Bob reaches the top.

And so on.

From these cases, I need to find a general rule.

Looking at the provided code, it seems to handle different cases based on the parity of x_a and x_b and the y positions.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me try to understand the code.

The code reads t test cases, then for each test case, it reads h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b.

Then, it checks:

if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:

answers.append('Draw')

So, if x_a > x_b or h == 1, it's a draw.

This makes sense because if Alice starts below Bob, she can't move up to reach him, and if h == 1, neither can move.

Next, it checks if x_a % 2 == 0 and x_b % 2 == 0 or (x_a % 2 != 0 and x_b % 2 != 0):

Which means if both x_a and x_b are even or both are odd.

Then, it checks if y_a == y_b:

answers.append('Bob')

So, if they are on the same column and both x_a and x_b have the same parity, Bob wins.

Wait, why Bob wins in this case?

Maybe because Bob can reach Alice before Alice reaches Bob.

Wait, let's see.

Alternatively, if y_a < y_b:

It checks if abs(y_a - y_b) > 1:

Then, it checks if y_a - 1 >= abs((x_a - x_b) // 2) or y_b - y_a >= abs((x_a - x_b) // 2):

answers.append('Draw')

Else:

answers.append('Bob')

Similarly for other cases.

This seems too convoluted.

I need to find a better way to think about this.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of moves Alice and Bob can make and the y-difference.

Let me define:

- m_a = h - x_a: number of moves Alice can make.

- m_b = x_b - 1: number of moves Bob can make.

- d_y = |y_a - y_b|: initial y-difference.

Now, in each full turn (Alice and Bob move once), the y-difference can change by -2 (both move towards each other diagonally), -1, 0, 1, or 2.

Alice wants to minimize d_y, while Bob wants to maximize it.

If Alice can make d_y <= 1 within min(m_a, m_b) full turns, she can capture Bob in the next move.

Similarly, Bob tries to prevent that.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the minimal possible d_y after min(m_a, m_b) full turns.

If minimal d_y <= 1, then Alice can capture Bob in her next move.

Else, it's a draw.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that in each full turn, the y-difference can be reduced by up to 2.

So, after k full turns, d_y can be reduced to d_y - 2k.

If d_y - 2k <= 1, then Alice can capture Bob in her next move.

But I need to make sure that k <= min(m_a, m_b).

Wait, actually, after k full turns, both have moved k times, so Alice has m_a - k moves left, and Bob has m_b - k moves left.

But it's getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the relative speed in y.

The relative speed is how much Alice can close the y-gap per full turn.

If Alice can close the y-gap by up to 2 per full turn, then in min(m_a, m_b) full turns, she can close up to 2 * min(m_a, m_b).

So, if d_y - 2 * min(m_a, m_b) <= 1, then Alice can capture Bob.

Else, it's a draw.

Wait, why <=1? Because if d_y <=1, Alice can capture Bob in her next move.

But I need to confirm this logic.

Let me consider:

- After k full turns, d_y <=1.

- Then, Alice can move to Bob's position in her next move.

- But she might not have a move left if m_a - k ==0.

Wait, after k full turns, Alice has m_a -k moves left, Bob has m_b -k moves left.

So, to capture Bob, Alice needs to have at least one move left after k full turns.

So, m_a - k >0.

Similarly, Bob needs m_b - k >0 to keep moving.

But this seems messy.

Let me try to find a better way.

Perhaps I can consider the time it takes for Alice to reach Bob's column.

Time for Alice to reach Bob's column is |y_a - y_b|, assuming she moves directly towards him.

But Bob is also moving up, so the effective relative movement needs to be considered.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that the game is turn-based and think recursively, but that's not efficient for large t.

I need a mathematical condition.

Wait, perhaps I can model it using game theory and find who has the winning strategy.

Let me think about the game in terms of who can force a win.

If Alice can reach Bob before she runs out of moves, she wins.

If Bob can reach Alice before she can reach him, he wins.

If neither can reach the other before one is stuck, it's a draw.

So, I need to find who can reach the other first.

Let me consider the following:

- The game is turn-based, with Alice moving first.

- Each player has a certain number of moves they can make.

- They can adjust their y-position by -1, 0, or +1 per move.

I need to see who can minimize the y-difference first.

This seems like a pursuit-evasion game, and such games can be solved using game theory concepts.

But I need a practical way to compute it.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to handle different cases based on the parity of x_a and x_b and the y positions.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me consider a simple case.

Case:

h=2, w=2, x_a=1, y_a=1, x_b=2, y_b=2

Alice can move to (2,1), (2,0), or (2,2).

But y=0 is invalid, so (2,1) or (2,2).

If she moves to (2,1), Bob is at (2,2). Alice can't capture Bob.

If she moves to (2,2), she captures Bob and wins.

So, Alice can win in one move.

According to the code:

x_a=1, x_b=2

x_a %2=1, x_b%2=0

So, it goes to the else clause.

clues[3] == clues[5]: y_a == y_b?

No, y_a=1, y_b=2

So, y_a < y_b

abs(y_a - y_b) >1: |1-2|=1, which is not >1

So, it's false.

So, it's a draw.

But in reality, Alice can move to (2,2) and win.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the code is flawed.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
