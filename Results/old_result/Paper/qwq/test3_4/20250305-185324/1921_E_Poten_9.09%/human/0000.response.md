Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game on a checkered board where Alice and Bob move their chips according to specific rules, and I need to determine the outcome of the game if both play optimally. The game ends either with one player winning by capturing the other's chip or with a draw if neither can move.

First, I need to understand the game setup and the moves each player can make. The board has h rows and w columns. Alice starts at (x_a, y_a) and Bob at (x_b, y_b). Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left, while Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left. They can't go beyond the board's boundaries.

The key here is that Alice moves first, and both players move alternately. The game ends immediately if a player lands on the same cell as the other player, and that player wins. If a player can't make a move—Alice if she's in the last row, Bob if he's in the first row—the game ends in a draw.

Given the constraints, with up to 10^4 test cases and h up to 10^6 and w up to 10^9, I need an efficient solution, probably O(h) per test case or better.

Looking at the problem, it seems like a game theory problem where I need to determine the winner based on the initial positions and the rules of movement.

First, I should consider the base cases:

1. If Alice is already at the same position as Bob initially, Alice wins immediately.

2. If Bob is already at the same position as Alice initially, Bob wins immediately.

But according to the problem, the initial positions are different, so these cases are excluded.

Next, consider the scenarios where the game ends in a draw:

1. If Alice is in the last row (x_a = h), she can't move, so it's a draw.

2. If Bob is in the first row (x_b = 1), he can't move, so it's a draw.

3. If both players are positioned in such a way that they can't reach each other's path, it's a draw.

Now, for the general case, I need to see if Alice can force a win or if Bob can force a win.

Given that Alice moves first, she has the advantage of initiating the pursuit. However, Bob can try to evade or intercept Alice.

I need to model their possible moves and see if there's a way for Alice to reach Bob before Bob can reach or block her.

Considering the movement directions:

- Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left.

- Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.

This suggests that Alice is moving towards higher row numbers, and Bob is moving towards lower row numbers.

Let me think about the rows and the distance between Alice and Bob.

Define the row difference as d_row = x_b - x_a.

Since Alice moves down and Bob moves up, they are moving towards each other in terms of rows.

In each turn, Alice increases her row by 1, and Bob decreases his row by 1.

So, in each full turn (Alice and Bob both move once), the row difference decreases by 2.

Therefore, the number of full turns before they meet in rows is d_row // 2.

After these turns, the remaining row difference is d_row % 2.

If d_row is even, they will meet in the same row after d_row / 2 turns.

If d_row is odd, they will be in rows differing by 1 after (d_row - 1) / 2 turns.

Now, I need to consider the column positions.

Let's define the column difference as d_col = y_b - y_a.

Alice can adjust her column position by moving down-right or down-left, changing her column by +1 or -1 per move.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column position by moving up-right or up-left, changing his column by +1 or -1 per move.

So, both can adjust their column positions by up to 1 per move.

I need to see if Alice can adjust her column position to match Bob's column position before they meet in the same row.

Similarly, Bob can try to adjust his column position to match Alice's before they meet.

This seems like a pursuit-evasion problem where Alice is pursuing Bob, and Bob is trying to evade or intercept.

Given that, I need to calculate if Alice can close both the row and column gaps to zero before Bob can do the same.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s define:

- The row difference d_row = x_b - x_a.

- The column difference d_col = y_b - y_a.

Alice needs to reduce d_row to 0 and simultaneously make sure that at that point, d_col is also 0.

Similarly, Bob needs to reduce d_row to 0 while making sure that at that point, d_col is 0.

Since Alice moves first, she has the first action.

I need to consider the number of moves Alice and Bob have.

In d_row moves, Alice can move down d_row times, and Bob can move up d_row times.

Wait, no. If d_row = x_b - x_a, then Alice needs to move down d_row times to reach Bob's initial row, but Bob will be moving up in those turns.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of moves each can make.

Alice can make at most h - x_a moves (since she starts at x_a and can go down to h).

Bob can make at most x_b - 1 moves (since he starts at x_b and can go up to 1).

The game ends when either one captures the other or when one can't move.

I need to find a way to model this efficiently.

Let me consider the relative movement.

Each time Alice moves down, the row difference decreases by 1.

Each time Bob moves up, the row difference decreases by 1.

So, in each turn, the row difference decreases by 2 (since Alice moves first, then Bob).

Wait, no. If Alice moves down once, d_row decreases by 1.

Then Bob moves up, d_row decreases by another 1.

So, in one full turn (Alice and Bob move once), d_row decreases by 2.

Therefore, the number of full turns until d_row becomes 0 or 1 is d_row // 2.

After that, if d_row is even, they meet in the same row after d_row / 2 turns.

If d_row is odd, they end up in adjacent rows.

Now, during these turns, both can adjust their column positions.

Each full turn, Alice can adjust her column by up to 1 (either left or right), and Bob can adjust his column by up to 1.

So, in t full turns, Alice can adjust her column by up to t, and Bob can adjust his column by up to t.

Wait, actually, in t full turns, Alice has moved down t times and can have adjusted her column by up to t, similarly for Bob.

Wait, but Alice moves down and can adjust column by up to t, and Bob moves up and can adjust column by up to t.

So, in t full turns, both can have adjusted their columns by up to t.

Now, after d_row // 2 full turns, the row difference is d_row % 2.

If d_row is even, they are in the same row.

If d_row is odd, they are in adjacent rows.

Now, if d_row is even, and they are in the same row, they can try to match columns.

The question is, can Alice adjust her column to match Bob's column at that point, or vice versa.

Given that both can adjust their columns by up to t, where t is d_row // 2.

Wait, more precisely, since each full turn consists of one move by Alice and one by Bob, the number of full turns is t = d_row // 2.

In t full turns, Alice can adjust her column by up to t, and Bob can adjust his column by up to t.

So, the column difference d_col can be adjusted by both players.

Alice wants to make d_col = 0 after t full turns, while Bob wants to prevent that.

But Alice moves first, so she has an advantage in adjusting the column.

Wait, but Bob also adjusts his column in his moves.

This seems like a race to see who can adjust their column position to match the other's.

Given that, perhaps the key is to see if the initial column difference d_col is within the range of adjustments that Alice can make minus what Bob can do.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the difference in their column positions and how much they can adjust relative to each other.

Let’s define the initial column difference as d_col = y_b - y_a.

In t full turns, Alice can adjust her column by up to t in either direction, and Bob can adjust his column by up to t in either direction.

So, the possible column positions for Alice after t turns are y_a + k_a, where -t <= k_a <= t.

Similarly, for Bob, y_b + k_b, where -t <= k_b <= t.

For Alice to capture Bob, there must be some k_a and k_b such that y_a + k_a = y_b + k_b.

That is, k_a - k_b = d_col.

Given that -t <= k_a <= t and -t <= k_b <= t, the difference k_a - k_b can range from -2t to 2t.

Therefore, if d_col is within -2t to 2t, Alice can choose k_a and k_b such that k_a - k_b = d_col.

But wait, Alice chooses k_a, and Bob chooses k_b to prevent capture.

This seems like a min-max problem.

Actually, since Bob is trying to avoid capture, he will choose k_b to avoid y_a + k_a = y_b + k_b.

Alice, on the other hand, wants to choose k_a to make y_a + k_a = y_b + k_b, no matter what k_b Bob chooses.

This seems like Alice needs to force k_a - k_b = d_col.

Given that both k_a and k_b are in [-t, t], the difference k_a - k_b can range from -2t to 2t.

So, if d_col is within -2t to 2t, Alice can choose k_a and k_b such that k_a - k_b = d_col.

But Bob can choose k_b to prevent this.

Wait, actually, Alice chooses k_a after seeing Bob's k_b, or vice versa.

No, in reality, Alice chooses her moves without knowing Bob's choices in advance, and vice versa.

This makes it more complex.

Perhaps I need to consider the relative column positions and see who can control the column adjustment better.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the distance between their column positions and how much they can close that distance per turn.

Let’s consider the effective column difference that can be closed per turn.

Each turn consists of Alice moving down and possibly adjusting her column by up to 1, and Bob moving up and possibly adjusting his column by up to 1.

So, per full turn (Alice and Bob move once), the column positions can change by up to 2 in total (Alice + Bob).

Wait, but they are both adjusting their positions independently.

I need to see if Alice can close the column gap by choosing her moves optimally.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimum number of moves required for Alice to reach Bob's column position.

But this seems tricky.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose h=6, w=5, x_a=2, y_a=2, x_b=5, y_b=3.

So, d_row = 5 - 2 = 3.

t = d_row // 2 = 1 full turn.

After 1 full turn, d_row becomes 3 - 2 = 1 (since each full turn reduces row difference by 2).

So, they are in rows 2 + 1 = 3 and 5 - 1 = 4, rows 3 and 4.

Now, column difference d_col = 3 - 2 = 1.

Alice can adjust her column by 1 (from y=2 to y=1,2,3), and Bob can adjust his column by 1 (from y=3 to y=2,3,4).

So, after 1 full turn, Alice is in row 3, column 1,2,3; Bob is in row 4, column 2,3,4.

They are in different rows, so no capture.

Now, Alice can't move further down (since she's in row 3 and Bob is in row 4), and Bob can't move further up (since he's in row 4 and Alice is in row 3).

So, they can't capture each other, and the game ends in a draw.

But according to the sample input, the first test case is:

6 5 2 2 5 3

And the output is Alice.

Wait, but according to my reasoning, it should be a draw.

Hmm, maybe my reasoning is flawed.

Let me think again.

Perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose her path optimally to intercept Bob, and Bob chooses his path to avoid or intercept Alice.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to model this.

I recall that in such pursuit-evasion games, the outcome often depends on whether the pursuer can close the distance faster than the evader can escape.

In this case, since both can adjust their columns by up to 1 per turn, and they are closing the row distance by 2 per full turn, the column distance effectively needs to be within a certain range for Alice to catch Bob.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of turns and the column adjustments.

Let’s define t = d_row // 2.

After t full turns, the row difference is d_row - 2t.

If d_row is even, d_row - 2t = 0, they are in the same row.

If d_row is odd, d_row - 2t = 1, they are in adjacent rows.

Now, in t full turns, both Alice and Bob can adjust their columns by up to t.

So, the effective column distance that can be closed is up to 2t.

If the initial column difference d_col <= 2t, Alice can potentially catch Bob.

Otherwise, Bob can evade.

But I need to consider who moves first and the exact mechanics.

Wait, in the case where d_row is even, they end up in the same row after t full turns.

If the column difference is <= 2t, Alice can adjust her column to match Bob's.

But Bob can also adjust his column to avoid Alice.

Wait, but Alice moves first, so she can plan her moves accordingly.

This seems like Alice can force a win if d_col <= 2t.

Otherwise, Bob can evade and it's a draw.

Similarly, if d_row is odd, they end up in adjacent rows, and perhaps cannot capture each other, leading to a draw.

But according to the sample input, this is not always the case.

Wait, in the sample input, for the first test case:

6 5 2 2 5 3

d_row = 5 - 2 = 3 (odd)

t = 1

2t = 2

d_col = 3 - 2 = 1 <= 2

Output is Alice.

But according to my earlier reasoning, since d_row is odd, they end up in adjacent rows, and it should be a draw.

But the sample output says Alice.

So, my reasoning must be flawed.

Perhaps I need to consider the exact mechanics of their movements.

Let me try to simulate the moves for this test case.

Test case 1:

h=6, w=5, x_a=2, y_a=2, x_b=5, y_b=3

Alice starts at (2,2), Bob at (5,3)

Alice moves first:

Option 1: down to (3,2)

Option 2: down-right to (3,3)

Option 3: down-left to (3,1)

Let's say Alice chooses to move to (3,3)

Now, Bob moves:

From (5,3), he can move up to (4,3), up-right to (4,4), or up-left to (4,2)

If Bob moves to (4,3), now Alice is at (3,3) and Bob is at (4,3)

Alice moves next:

From (3,3), she can move down to (4,3), down-right to (4,4), or down-left to (4,2)

If she moves to (4,3), she captures Bob's position, so Alice wins.

This seems to align with the sample output.

But, in my earlier reasoning, I thought they would be in different rows after t full turns and it would be a draw.

What's the difference?

Ah, perhaps I miscalculated the number of full turns.

Let me recalculate.

d_row = 5 - 2 = 3

t = d_row // 2 = 1

After 1 full turn (Alice and Bob each move once):

Alice moves down to (3, ?)

Bob moves up to (4, ?)

Now, row difference is 4 - 3 = 1, which is d_row - 2t = 3 - 2 = 1

They are in rows 3 and 4.

Now, Alice moves again, since she moves first.

From row 3, she can move down to row 4.

So, in the second turn (which is Alice's second move), she can move to row 4.

Thus, in total, Alice has moved down twice, from 2 to 3 to 4, and Bob has moved up once, from 5 to 4.

So, Alice has moved down two rows, and Bob has moved up one row.

Wait, but in terms of full turns, t = d_row // 2 = 1, which corresponds to one full turn where both move once.

Then, since d_row is odd, there's an extra move by Alice.

So, in this case, Alice has one additional move after t full turns.

That makes sense.

So, in the first full turn:

Alice moves down to (3, ?)

Bob moves up to (4, ?)

Then, Alice moves again to (4, ?)

At this point, both are in row 4.

Now, if Alice can adjust her column to match Bob's column in her second move, she wins.

Otherwise, it's a draw.

So, in this scenario, Alice has one extra move to adjust her position to match Bob's.

Similarly, in cases where d_row is even, they meet in the same row after t full turns, and Alice can try to adjust her column to match Bob's.

Wait, but in the earlier example, with d_row even, if d_col <= 2t, Alice can win.

But in the sample input, for d_row odd, and d_col <= 2t, Alice can still win.

Wait, but in the first test case, d_row = 3, t =1, 2t=2, d_col=1<=2, and Alice wins.

In another test case where d_row is even, say d_row=4, t=2, 2t=4, if d_col <=4, Alice can win.

But I need to verify this with the sample inputs.

Looking back at the sample input:

Test case 1:

6 5 2 2 5 3 → Alice

d_row=3, t=1, 2t=2, d_col=1<=2 → Alice wins

Test case 2:

4 1 2 1 4 1 → Bob

d_row=2, t=1, 2t=2, d_col=0<=2 → but output is Bob

Wait, according to my earlier logic, if d_col <=2t, Alice should win, but here it's Bob.

So, my logic is flawed.

I need to reconsider.

Perhaps I need to consider who moves last when d_row is odd.

In the first test case, d_row=3, t=1 full turn, and Alice has one extra move.

After t full turns, they are in rows 3 and 4.

Then Alice moves to row 4.

Now, in row 4, Alice can adjust her column to match Bob's.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column.

But Alice moves first, so she can choose to land on Bob's position.

Hence, Alice wins.

In the second test case:

4 1 2 1 4 1 → Bob

d_row=2, t=1, 2t=2, d_col=0<=2

But output is Bob.

So, in this case, even though d_col <=2t, it's Bob who wins.

This contradicts my earlier assumption.

Hence, I need a different approach.

Let me consider the relative speeds.

Alice closes the row distance by 1 per move, and Bob closes it by 1 per move.

So, per full turn, the row distance closes by 2.

The column distance can be adjusted by up to 1 per move by each player.

Hence, per full turn, the column distance can be adjusted by up to 2.

Wait, but in the second test case:

h=4, w=1, x_a=2, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=1

d_row=2, t=1, 2t=2, d_col=0<=2

But output is Bob.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, Alice should win.

But she doesn't.

Hence, my logic is incomplete.

Perhaps I need to consider the parity of the row difference.

Looking back at the first test case:

d_row=3 (odd), 2t=2, d_col=1<=2 → Alice wins

Second test case:

d_row=2 (even), 2t=2, d_col=0<=2 → Bob wins

Wait, perhaps the parity of d_row affects who can win.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample outputs.

Looking at all sample inputs and outputs:

Input:

12

6 5 2 2 5 3 → Alice

4 1 2 1 4 1 → Bob

1 4 1 3 1 1 → Draw

5 5 1 4 5 2 → Draw

4 4 1 1 4 4 → Draw

10 10 1 6 10 8 → Alice

10 10 2 6 10 7 → Draw

10 10 9 1 8 1 → Draw

10 10 8 1 10 2 → Bob

10 10 1 1 2 1 → Alice

10 10 1 3 4 1 → Alice

10 10 3 1 1 1 → Draw

Looking for patterns:

- When d_row is odd, Alice tends to win.

- When d_row is even, it varies.

Wait, in the first test case, d_row=3 (odd), Alice wins.

Second test case, d_row=2 (even), Bob wins.

Third test case, h=1, which is a special case, output is Draw.

Fourth test case, d_row=4 (even), output is Draw.

Fifth test case, d_row=3 (odd), output is Draw.

Wait, inconsistency.

Sixth test case, d_row=9 (odd), output is Alice.

Seventh test case, d_row=8 (even), output is Draw.

Eighth test case, d_row=2 (even), output is Draw.

Ninth test case, d_row=2 (even), output is Bob.

Tenth test case, d_row=1 (odd), output is Alice.

Eleventh test case, d_row=3 (odd), output is Alice.

Twelfth test case, d_row=2 (even), output is Draw.

Hmm, seems like when d_row is odd, Alice tends to win, but not always.

When d_row is even, it varies.

Perhaps I need to consider more factors.

Let me consider the relative positions and movements more carefully.

Let’s consider that Alice is moving down and Bob is moving up.

If Alice can reach Bob's row before Bob reaches Alice's row, she can try to capture him.

But Bob is moving up to try to capture Alice or to avoid being captured.

Given that, perhaps I need to calculate the number of moves Alice needs to reach Bob's initial row and see if she can adjust her column position accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Alice needing to intercept Bob's position at some point.

Given that, perhaps I can model their paths and see if their paths can intersect at some point.

But that might be too slow for the time constraints.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the game as a race where Alice is trying to minimize the distance to Bob, and Bob is trying to maximize it.

Given that, perhaps I can calculate the minimum number of moves Alice needs to reach Bob's position and compare it to the number of moves Bob needs to reach Alice's position or to escape.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Calculate the number of moves Alice needs to reach Bob's initial row.

- Calculate the number of moves Bob needs to reach Alice's initial row.

- See who can reach the intersection point first and adjust columns accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of meeting at a certain row and column.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me consider the concept of "meeting point."

Suppose Alice and Bob will meet at some row r, where x_a + a = x_b - b, where a is the number of moves Alice makes down, and b is the number of moves Bob makes up.

So, a + b = x_b - x_a.

This is the total row difference.

Now, in a moves by Alice and b moves by Bob, they can adjust their columns by up to a and b, respectively.

So, the column difference that can be closed is up to a + b.

Given that a + b = d_row, and a = d_row - b.

So, the column difference that can be closed is d_row.

Therefore, if the initial column difference d_col <= d_row, Alice can win.

Otherwise, Bob can evade.

But in the sample input, this doesn't hold.

For example, in the first test case:

d_row=3, d_col=1 <=3, Alice wins.

Second test case:

d_row=2, d_col=0 <=2, but output is Bob.

Hmm, inconsistency again.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider who moves last.

In the first test case, d_row=3, so Alice makes 2 moves down, and Bob makes 1 move up.

Alice moves first, so she makes move 1, then Bob move 1, then Alice move 2.

So, Alice has one more move.

Hence, she can adjust her position better.

In the second test case, d_row=2, so Alice makes 1 move down, and Bob makes 1 move up.

They both make one move, and meet in the same row.

In this case, Bob can adjust his position to avoid Alice or capture her.

In the sample input, it's Bob who wins in this case.

Hence, perhaps when d_row is even, Bob can win, and when d_row is odd, Alice can win.

But in the sample input, for d_row=3 (odd), Alice wins; for d_row=2 (even), Bob wins; for d_row=4 (even), Draw; for d_row=1 (odd), Alice wins.

So, it's not solely based on the parity of d_row.

I need to find a better way to classify the outcomes.

Let me consider the relative positions and see if Alice can force a win or not.

Another approach is to consider the game as a graph where nodes represent game states, and edges represent moves.

But with h up to 1e6 and w up to 1e9, this is infeasible.

I need a mathematical condition to determine the winner.

Let me consider the following:

- If Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach her position, she wins.

- If Bob can reach Alice's position before Alice can reach his position, he wins.

- If neither can reach the other's position, it's a draw.

But I need to formalize this.

Let’s define:

- Alice's moves: down, down-right, down-left.

- Bob's moves: up, up-right, up-left.

So
