Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. If it's possible to do so, I should output "YES", followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. If not, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba". So, my task is to split the string into parts where none of these parts is a palindrome.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

sinktheyacht

Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

Here, the entire string "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome, so it's acceptable to have just one part.

Example 2:

Input:

lllllllll

Output:

NO

In this case, the string consists of all 'l's, so any substring would also consist of 'l's and hence be a palindrome. Therefore, it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

Example 3:

Input:

uwuowouwu

Output:

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

Here, the string is partitioned into "uw", "uow", and "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

From these examples, I can see that if the entire string is not a palindrome, I can simply take it as one part. If it is a palindrome, I need to find a way to split it into smaller substrings that are not palindromes.

But, there are cases where even if the whole string is not a palindrome, I might need to split it to ensure that all parts are non-palindromic. For instance, if the string is "abba_cba", the whole string is not a palindrome because 'c' breaks the symmetry, but "abba" is a palindrome, so I need to split it to avoid having "abba" as a part.

Wait, but according to the problem, I just need to have a partition where each substring is not a palindrome. So, in "abba_cba", I can partition it as "abb_a_cba", where "abb" and "a" and "cba" are all non-palindromic substrings. But "a" is a palindrome, so that's not valid. So, I need to be careful.

Actually, single characters are palindromes, so I cannot have them as parts. So, in the previous example, "a" is a palindrome, so that partition is invalid. I need to ensure that each substring has at least two different characters in a way that it's not a palindrome.

Wait, but the problem allows substrings of any length, including length 1, but length 1 substrings are palindromes, so they are invalid. So, I need to make sure that each substring has at least two characters and is not a palindrome.

Wait, no. The problem says "each substring is not a palindrome", and a palindrome includes single characters. So, I need to avoid single-character substrings.

But, in the first example, "sinktheyacht" is taken as one substring, which is fine because it's not a palindrome. In the third example, it's split into multiple substrings, each with more than one character.

So, perhaps the strategy is:

- If the entire string is not a palindrome, output it as a single part.

- If the entire string is a palindrome, try to split it into two parts, and check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If splitting into two parts doesn't work, try splitting into more parts.

But, there might be a smarter way.

Let me think about the conditions under which it's impossible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

If the string consists of repeated identical characters, like "aaaa", then any substring is a palindrome, so it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings. That's why in the second example, "lllllllll" results in "NO".

Another case is when the string is a palindrome but cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings. For example, "abcba" is a palindrome. If I split it into "abc" and "ba", "abc" is not a palindrome, but "ba" is not a palindrome either. So, this might work. But I need to check.

Wait, "ba" is not a palindrome because it's symmetric. Wait, no, "ba" is not a palindrome because reversing it gives "ab", which is different from "ba". So, "ba" is not a palindrome. So, in this case, splitting "abcba" into "abc" and "ba" would work, as both are not palindromes.

Wait, but "abc" is not a palindrome, and "ba" is not a palindrome. So, it's valid.

But, what about "abba"? It's a palindrome. If I split it into "ab" and "ba", both are not palindromes. So, it's valid.

What about "racecar"? It's a palindrome. Splitting into "rac" and "ecar", "rac" is not a palindrome, and "ecar" is not a palindrome. So, it's valid.

So, it seems that for any palindrome, I can split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, is there any palindrome where this doesn't work?

Let's think about "a". It's a palindrome, but since single characters are palindromes, and I cannot have single-character parts, it's impossible to partition "a" into non-palindromic substrings. So, for strings of length 1, it's always "NO".

Wait, but according to the problem, strings can have length up to 10^6, so I need to handle longer strings.

Another consideration is that if the string has all identical characters, like "aaa", then any substring is a palindrome, so it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

Similarly, if the string has repeating patterns that are palindromes, like "ababab", I need to find a way to split it such that each part is not a palindrome.

In "ababab", splitting it into "aba" and "bab" would have "aba" which is a palindrome, so that's invalid. But splitting into "ab" and "ab" and "ab" would work, as "ab" is not a palindrome.

So, in general, if the string is not a palindrome, I can take the whole string as one part. If it is a palindrome, I can try splitting it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, I need to ensure that the parts are not palindromes.

So, perhaps the key is to check if the string is a palindrome. If it's not, output it as one part. If it is, try splitting it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, I need to make sure that the two parts are not palindromes themselves.

How can I ensure that?

One way is to split the string into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

For example, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works, as both are not palindromes.

In "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" works.

In "a", it's impossible.

In "aa", splitting into "a" and "a" is invalid because single characters are palindromes.

Wait, but "aa" is a palindrome. If I split it into "a" and "a", both are palindromes, which is invalid.

Is there any way to split "aa" into non-palindromic substrings? No, because the only possible splits are "a" and "a", both of which are palindromes.

So, for strings like "aa", it's impossible.

Similarly, "aaa" can only be split into "a" and "aa", but "a" is a palindrome, and "aa" is a palindrome, so it's impossible.

Wait, "aa" is a palindrome, and splitting it into "a" and "a" is invalid.

So, in general, for strings where all possible splits result in at least one palindrome, it's impossible.

But, in practice, for strings that are palindromes and have all identical characters, it's impossible.

For strings that are palindromes but have different characters, perhaps it's possible to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, in "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" works, as neither is a palindrome.

In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

In "a", it's impossible.

In "ab", which is not a palindrome, taking it as one part works.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as one part.

- If the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than 1, try splitting it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- If splitting into two parts doesn't work, try splitting into more parts.

- If the string is a palindrome and all possible splits result in palindromic substrings, then output "NO".

But, in practice, for strings that are palindromes and consist of repeating characters, it's impossible to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

For strings that are palindromes but have varying characters, it's possible to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps I need to check if the string is a palindrome. If it's not, output it as one part. If it is a palindrome, check if all characters are the same. If they are, output "NO". If they are not, then split the string into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, I need to ensure that the two parts are not palindromes.

Wait, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

In "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" works.

In "aaa", splitting into "a" and "aa" doesn't work because both are palindromes.

In "aabaa", which is a palindrome, splitting into "aab" and "aa" would have "aab" which is not a palindrome, and "aa" which is a palindrome. So, that's invalid.

Wait, but "aab" is not a palindrome, and "aa" is a palindrome. So, if I split into "aab" and "a", "aab" is not a palindrome, but "a" is a palindrome. So, invalid.

Wait, but "aabaa" is a palindrome. Maybe I need to find a different split.

Alternatively, split into "aa" and "baa". "aa" is a palindrome, invalid.

Or "a" and "abaa". "a" is a palindrome, invalid.

Or "aab" and "aa". "aab" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe splitting into "aab" and "a" doesn't work because "a" is a palindrome.

But, perhaps splitting into "aaba" and "a". "aaba" is not a palindrome, and "a" is a palindrome.

Still invalid.

So, for "aabaa", it seems impossible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

But, according to the problem constraints, is "aabaa" possible or not?

Wait, "aabaa" is a palindrome, and trying to split it into non-palindromic substrings seems impossible.

So, perhaps there are palindromic strings that cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, "lllllllll" is impossible, and "aabaa" seems impossible as well.

So, perhaps the condition is not just that the string is a palindrome, but also that all possible splits result in palindromic substrings.

But, in "aabaa", not all possible splits result in palindromic substrings, but in every possible split, at least one substring is a palindrome.

Wait, in "aabaa", splitting into "aab" and "aa": "aab" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

So, in this case, one part is not a palindrome, but the other is a palindrome.

So, it's invalid.

Alternatively, splitting into "a" and "abaa": "a" is a palindrome, "abaa" is not a palindrome.

Again, one part is a palindrome.

Splitting into "aaba" and "a": "aaba" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

Still invalid.

So, it seems impossible to split "aabaa" into multiple parts where all parts are non-palindromic.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings, it's only possible to split them into non-palindromic substrings if the string is not composed entirely of identical characters.

Wait, but "aabaa" is not composed of identical characters, but still, it's impossible to split it into only non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

If a string is a palindrome, then it reads the same forwards and backwards.

If I split it into two parts, say s = uv, then for s to be a palindrome, the reverse of s is s itself.

But, I need to ensure that neither u nor v is a palindrome.

But, in "aabaa", any split seems to result in at least one palindrome.

So, maybe for certain palindromic strings, it's impossible to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a general rule: if a string is a palindrome and its length is odd with the middle character being unique, or something like that, it might be impossible to split.

But, I'm getting confused.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps, I can consider that for a string to be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, all its substrings must not be palindromes.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

I need to partition the string into substrings where each substring is not a palindrome.

One way to ensure this is to make sure that in each substring, the first character is different from the last character.

Wait, that's not sufficient, because the substring could still be a palindrome even if the first and last characters are the same, as long as the entire substring doesn't read the same forwards and backwards.

Wait, but that's the definition of a palindrome.

So, perhaps checking if the first and last characters are different can help, but it's not sufficient.

Wait, for example, "abba" has first and last characters both 'a', but it's a palindrome.

So, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps ensuring that the substring has at least two different characters and doesn't satisfy the palindrome property.

But, this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a string that is not a palindrome. Then, I can take the whole string as one part.

If the string is a palindrome, I need to split it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

But, as seen in earlier examples, even splitting a palindrome into two parts may result in at least one part being a palindrome.

So, perhaps a better approach is to iterate through the string and try to find a split where neither part is a palindrome.

But, this seems inefficient, especially given the constraints of large string lengths (up to 10^6 per string).

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(N) per test case.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as one part.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try to split the string into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- To ensure that both parts are not palindromes, I need to make sure that neither part is a palindrome.

- To do this, I can split the string into two parts where the first part is not a palindrome, and the second part is not a palindrome.

- To ensure that a substring is not a palindrome, I can check if it's not equal to its reverse.

But, this seems too slow for large strings.

Is there a smarter way to check if a palindrome can be split into non-palindromic substrings?

Let me consider that for a palindrome, if I can find a split where neither part is a palindrome, then it's possible.

Given that the string is a palindrome, what properties do its substrings have?

Well, in a palindrome, the first half mirrors the second half.

So, if I split the string into two unequal parts, say s = u + v, where u and v are not equal in length, then u and v are not palindromes unless they have some specific structure.

Wait, for example, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works, as neither is a palindrome.

In "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" works, as neither is a palindrome.

In "aabaa", splitting into "aab" and "aa" has "aab" not a palindrome, but "aa" is a palindrome.

Splitting into "a" and "abaa" has "a" a palindrome, invalid.

Splitting into "aa" and "baa" has "aa" a palindrome, invalid.

Splitting into "aab" and "a" has "a" a palindrome, invalid.

So, in "aabaa", it seems impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

Similarly, in "aaa", splitting into "aa" and "a" both are palindromes.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as one part.

- If the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, split the string into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

- To ensure that neither part is a palindrome, ensure that neither part is equal to its reverse.

But, in practice, for palindromic strings with varying characters, splitting into two parts where one part is not equal to its reverse should be possible.

Wait, in "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" works.

"abc" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

In "a", it's impossible.

In "aa", splitting into "a" and "a" is invalid.

In "aabaa", it seems impossible.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If the string is a palindrome and its length is odd with the central character being unique, it might be impossible to split.

Wait, in "aabaa", the central 'b' is unique, but in "abba", it's even length.

Wait, perhaps for palindromic strings where the first character appears only in the first and last positions, it's possible to split.

But, I'm getting too tangled.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps, I can use the fact that if a string is a palindrome, then any split where both parts are not palindromes would work.

To ensure that a part is not a palindrome, I can ensure that its first character is different from its last character.

Wait, but in "abba", the first character 'a' is equal to the last character 'a', but it's a palindrome.

So, having the first and last characters equal doesn't necessarily make it a palindrome.

Wait, no, in "abba", first and last characters are equal, and it's a palindrome.

But, in "abcba", first and last are equal, and it's a palindrome.

In "aabaa", first and last are equal.

So, perhaps if the first and last characters are equal and the string is a palindrome, splitting it into two parts where one part has the first character and the other has the last character might not work.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think about this differently.

Suppose I have a palindromic string s.

If s is a palindrome, then s = reverse(s).

Now, if I split s into u and v, then u and v must both not be palindromes.

That is, u != reverse(u) and v != reverse(v).

I need to find u and v such that u + v = s, u != reverse(u), and v != reverse(v).

Is this always possible?

From the earlier examples, it seems that for some palindromic strings, it's possible, and for some, it's not.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me consider the frequency of characters in the string.

If the string is a palindrome and consists of all identical characters, it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

If the string is a palindrome and has varying characters, perhaps it's possible to split it into two non-palindromic substrings.

But, as seen in "aabaa", it's impossible.

Wait, in "aabaa", the frequency of 'a' is 4 and 'b' is 1.

Wait, perhaps if the central character is unique, it's impossible.

Wait, in "abba", the central part is 'bb', which is not unique.

In "abcba", the central 'c' is unique.

So, maybe for palindromic strings with a unique central character, it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

But, in "abba", which has 'bb' in the middle, it's possible to split.

In "aabaa", which has 'b' in the middle, it's impossible.

In "abcba", which has 'c' in the middle, it's impossible.

Wait, but earlier I thought splitting "abcba" into "abc" and "ba" works, but "ba" is not a palindrome.

Wait, "abc" is not a palindrome, and "ba" is not a palindrome.

Is "ba" a palindrome? Wait, "ba" reversed is "ab", which is different from "ba", so "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, in "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" should work.

Wait, but in "aabaa", splitting into "aab" and "aa" has "aab" not a palindrome and "aa" a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, splitting into "a" and "abaa" has "a" a palindrome and "abaa" not a palindrome, which is invalid.

Splitting into "aa" and "baa" has "aa" a palindrome and "baa" not a palindrome, invalid.

Splitting into "aab" and "a" has "aab" not a palindrome and "a" a palindrome, invalid.

Splitting into "aaba" and "a" has "aaba" not a palindrome and "a" a palindrome, invalid.

So, in "aabaa", it's impossible to split into parts where all parts are non-palindromic.

Similarly, in "aaa", it's impossible.

In "aa", it's impossible.

In "a", it's impossible.

In "ab", which is not a palindrome, taking it as one part works.

In "abb", which is not a palindrome, taking it as one part works.

In "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" works.

Wait, but in "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" should work, as both are not palindromes.

Wait, but "abc" is not a palindrome because "abc" != "cba", and "ba" != "ab".

So, perhaps for palindromic strings with length greater than 2, it's possible to split them into two non-palindromic substrings.

But, in "aabaa", it's not possible.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as one part.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try splitting it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- To ensure that both parts are not palindromes, make sure that neither part is equal to its reverse.

But, in practice, for "aabaa", it's impossible, even though not all characters are the same.

So, perhaps a better condition is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as one part.

- If the string is a palindrome and its length is 1, output "NO".

- If the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than 1:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, split the string into two parts where one part is not a palindrome.

- Since the string is a palindrome, splitting it into two parts where one part has different first and last characters might work.

But, this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for a palindromic string, if I can find a split where neither part is a palindrome, then it's possible.

To check if a substring is a palindrome, I can compare it to its reverse.

But, for large strings, this would be inefficient.

I need a smarter way.

Perhaps, I can use the concept of the minimal number of palindromic substrings needed to partition the string, but I don't think that's directly applicable here.

Wait, maybe I can use Manacher's algorithm to find all palindromic substrings, but that might be overkill.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a palindromic string s.

If s is a palindrome, then s[0] == s[-1], s[1] == s[-2], and so on.

So, if I split s into u and v, where u = s[0..k-1] and v = s[k..n-1], I need to ensure that u != reverse(u) and v != reverse(v).

Given that s is a palindrome, s[k..n-1] = reverse(s[0..n-1-k]).

So, v = reverse(s[0..n-1-k]).

So, to ensure that v is not a palindrome, reverse(v) != v.

But reverse(v) = reverse(reverse(s[0..n-1-k])) = s[0..n-1-k].

So, v != s[0..n-1-k].

Wait, v = s[k..n-1] = reverse(s[0..n-1-k]).

So, v != s[0..n-1-k].

So, if s[0..n-1-k] != reverse(s[0..n-1-k]), then v is not a palindrome.

Wait, that means if s[0..n-1-k] is not a palindrome, then v is not a palindrome.

Similarly, u is not a palindrome if u != reverse(u).

So, to have both u and v not palindromes, I need:

u != reverse(u) and v != reverse(v).

Given that v = reverse(s[0..n-1-k]), v != s[0..n-1-k].

So, to have v != reverse(v), which is v != s[k..n-1], but s[k..n-1] = reverse(s[0..n-1-k]).

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for a palindromic string s:

- If s is a palindrome and its length is greater than 1, and it's not composed of all identical characters, then it's possible to split it into two non-palindromic substrings.

- Otherwise, it's impossible.

But, as seen in "aabaa", it's impossible even if it's not composed of all identical characters.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than 1, and it's not composed of all identical characters, and its length is even, then it's possible to split it into two non-palindromic substrings.

- If the string is a palindrome, its length is odd, and the central character is unique, then it's impossible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

But, this seems too specific.

Let me consider that for a palindromic string, if I can find a split where neither part is a palindrome, then it's possible.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

So, perhaps I can implement a function that, given a palindromic string, tries to split it into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

To do this efficiently, I can:

- Check if the string is a palindrome.

- If it's not, output it as one part.

- If it is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try to find a k such that both s[0..k-1] and s[k..n-1] are not palindromes.

- To check if a substring is a palindrome, I can use hashing or some efficient method.

But, given the constraints, I need an O(N) solution.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the hash of the string and its reverse, and then for each possible k, check if s[0..k-1] and s[k..n-1] are not palindromes.

But, this would still be O(N), which is acceptable.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read the string s.

b. Check if s is a palindrome.

- If it's not, output "YES" and the string as one part.

- If it is a palindrome:

i. Check if all characters are the same.

- If they are, output "NO".

- If they are not, try to find a k (1 < k < n) such that neither s[0..k-1] nor s[k..n-1] is a palindrome.

- To check this efficiently, precompute the hash of the prefixes and suffixes and their reverses.

c. If such a k is found, output "YES", the number of parts (which is 2), and the two parts.

d. If no such k is found, output "NO".

But, in "aabaa", it's impossible, so I need to handle such cases.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider splitting into more than two parts.

But, to keep it simple, perhaps splitting into two parts is sufficient in most cases, and if not, try splitting into more parts.

But, for "aabaa", it's impossible, so I need to handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can generalize that for palindromic strings that are not composed of all identical characters, it's possible to split them into non-palindromic substrings, except for certain cases like "aabaa".

But, I need a concrete algorithm.

Let me think about implementing the hash approach.

I can compute the hash of the prefix s[0..k-1] and its reverse, and check if they are equal.

Similarly, for s[k..n-1], compute its hash and its reverse's hash.

If neither pair of hashes are equal, then both parts are not palindromes.

I can precompute prefix hashes and suffix hashes for both the string and its reverse.

Then, for each k from 1 to n-1, check if s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome and s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome.

If I find such a k, output "YES" and the two parts.

If no such k exists, output "NO".

This should work in O(N) time per test case, which is acceptable given the constraints.

But, in "aabaa", it's a palindrome, not all characters are the same, but splitting into two parts always results in at least one palindrome.

So, perhaps I need to handle such exceptions differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to split into more than two parts.

But, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that if there exists any partition where all parts are non-palindromic, output "YES" and one such partition.

So, perhaps splitting into more than two parts might help in some cases.

But, for "aabaa", it seems impossible.

Wait, in "aabaa", if I split it into "a", "a", "b", "a", "a", but single characters are palindromes, so invalid.

Alternatively, splitting into "aa", "b", "aa", but "aa" is a palindrome, invalid.

So, indeed, it's impossible.

So, perhaps my condition should be:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as one part.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try to split it into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

- If such a split exists, output "YES" and those two parts.

- Else, output "NO".

And accept that for some palindromic strings, it's impossible to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

Now, I need to implement this logic efficiently.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Read the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

a. Read the string s.

b. Check if s is a palindrome.

- If s != s[::-1], output "YES", 1, s.

- Else, proceed.

c. Check if all characters in s are the same.

- If set(s) has only one unique character, output "NO".

- Else, proceed.

d. Precompute the hash values for prefixes and suffixes of s and their reverses.

e. For each k from 1 to n-1:

i. Check if s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome (hash of s[0..k-1] != hash of reverse of s[0..k-1]).

ii. Check if s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome (hash of s[k..n-1] != hash of reverse of s[k..n-1]).

iii. If both conditions are satisfied, output "YES", 2, s[0..k-1], s[k..n-1], and break.

f. If no such k is found, output "NO".

This should work.

I need to implement this efficiently using rolling hashes to compute the hash values in O(N) time.

But, implementing rolling hashes correctly can be error-prone.

Alternatively, in Python, I can use built-in functions to check if a substring is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse, but this would be O(N^2) in the worst case, which is too slow for N up to 10^6.

So, I need to use a more efficient method.

Let me consider precomputing the hash values.

Define a large prime number P and a base B (e.g., B=257).

Compute the hash of s[0..k-1] as H1 = s[0]*B^{k-1} + s[1]*B^{k-2} + ... + s[k-1]*B^0 mod P.

Compute the hash of the reverse of s[0..k-1] as H1_rev = s[k-1]*B^{k-1} + s[k-2]*B^{k-2} + ... + s[0]*B^0 mod P.

Similarly, compute H2 for s[k..n-1] and H2_rev for its reverse.

If H1 != H1_rev and H2 != H2_rev, then both parts are not palindromes.

I can precompute the prefix hashes and suffix hashes using rolling hash in O(N) time.

Then, for each k, I can get H1 and H2 in O(1) time.

Similarly, H1_rev and H2_rev can be precomputed.

Thus, the entire check can be done in O(N) time.

Now, I need to implement this carefully.

Also, to handle large N, I need to choose P appropriately to minimize hash collisions.

I can choose P to be a large prime, say 10^9 + 7.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

But, to make it even more efficient, perhaps I can find a single k that works.

Given that s is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, I can try to find a k such that s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome and s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome.

Since s is a palindrome, s[k..n-1] = reverse(s[0..n-1-k]).

So, s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome if s[0..n-1-k] is not a palindrome.

Therefore, I need to find k such that s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome and s[0..n-1-k] is not a palindrome.

Wait, s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome, and s[0..n-1-k] is not a palindrome.

So, if I choose k such that s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome and s[0..n-1-k] is not a palindrome, then it should work.

This reduces the problem to finding k where both s[0..k-1] and s[0..n-1-k] are not palindromes.

This seems more manageable.

Now, I can precompute for each prefix whether it's a palindrome or not.

Let me define an array is_pal[l][r] which tells whether s[l..r] is a palindrome.

But, with N up to 10^6, I need an O(N) solution.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the smallest k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome.

Similarly, precompute the smallest m where s[0..m-1] is not a palindrome.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal k where s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome, and the minimal m where s[0..m-1] is not a palindrome, and then choose k such that k-1 >= m.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate k from 1 to n-1.

For each k, check if s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome and s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome.

Given that s is a palindrome, s[k..n-1] = reverse(s[0..n-1-k]).

So, s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome if s[0..n-1-k] is not a palindrome.

Therefore, for each k, I need s[0..k-1] not palindrome and s[0..n-1-k] not palindrome.

So, I can precompute for each prefix length, whether it's a palindrome.

Let me precompute an array prefix_pal where prefix_pal[k] = True if s[0..k-1] is a palindrome, else False.

Then, for each k from 1 to n-1, if prefix_pal[k] == False and prefix_pal[n - k] == False, then choose this k.

This would allow me to find a k where both parts are not palindromes.

This seems efficient.

I can compute prefix_pal in O(N) time using Manacher's algorithm, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, I can compute prefix_pal using hashing.

Define hash_prefix[k] = hash of s[0..k-1]

hash_prefix_rev[k] = hash of the reverse of s[0..k-1]

Then, prefix_pal[k] = (hash_prefix[k] == hash_prefix_rev[k])

Similarly, for s[k..n-1], it's not a palindrome if hash_suffix[n - k] != hash_suffix_rev[n - k]

But, since s is a palindrome, hash_suffix[n - k] == hash_prefix[k]

and hash_suffix_rev[n - k] == hash_prefix_rev[k]

Therefore, s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome if hash_prefix[k] != hash_prefix_rev[k]

So, to have both parts not palindromes, I need:

hash_prefix[k] != hash_prefix_rev[k] and hash_prefix[n - k] != hash_prefix_rev[n - k]

Wait, hash_prefix[n - k] is the hash of s[0..n - k - 1]

But s[k..n-1] = reverse(s[0..n - k - 1])

So, hash_suffix[k] = hash of s[k..n-1] = hash of reverse(s[0..n - k - 1]) = hash_prefix_rev[n - k]

Similarly, hash_suffix_rev[k] = hash of reverse(s[k..n-1]) = hash of s[k..n-1] reversed = hash_prefix[n - k]

Therefore, s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome if hash_suffix[k] != hash_suffix_rev[k], which is hash_prefix_rev[n - k] != hash_prefix[n - k]

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Let me try to simplify.

Given that s is a palindrome, s[k..n-1] = reverse(s[0..n - k - 1])

So, s[k..n-1] is a palindrome if and only if s[0..n - k - 1] is a palindrome.

Therefore, s[k..n-1] is not a palindrome if and only if s[0..n - k - 1] is not a palindrome.

So, to have both parts not palindromes, I need:

s[0..k-1] is not a palindrome and s[0..n - k - 1] is not a palindrome.

Therefore, I can precompute for each k, whether s[0..k-1] is a palindrome.

Then, for each k from 1 to n-1, check if not prefix_pal[k] and not prefix_pal[n - k].

If such a k exists, output "YES" and the two parts.

Otherwise, output
