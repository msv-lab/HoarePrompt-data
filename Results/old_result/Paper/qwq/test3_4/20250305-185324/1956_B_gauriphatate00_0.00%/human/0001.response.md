Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck of 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, with each integer appearing exactly twice. So, there are two cards for each integer.

In the beginning, the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating between me and Nene, for a total of 2n turns. Each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at its number x, and checks if there's already a card with that number on the table. If there is, the player gets a point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Important points:

- The game is played publicly, meaning both players can see all the cards on the table at any time.

- Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics and the interactions between my moves and Nene's moves.

Let's think about how the game progresses:

1. We have 2n turns in total, n turns for me and n turns for Nene.

2. Each turn, a player picks one card from their hand and plays it on the table.

3. If the card's number is already on the table, the player scores a point.

4. The game continues until all cards are played.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, I need to anticipate her moves based on the cards I play.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1 from the problem:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

As per the explanation, one possible game progression is:

1. I play one of the 1's.

2. Nene plays one of the 4's.

3. I play the other 1, scoring a point because 1 is already on the table.

4. Nene plays the other 4, scoring a point.

5. I play 2, no score.

6. Nene plays 2, scoring a point.

7. I play 3, no score.

8. Nene plays 3, scoring a point.

Final scores: Me - 1, Nene - 3

It's claimed that I can't do better than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

Let me try to see if there's a better strategy for me.

Suppose I play 2 first:

1. I play 2.

2. Nene plays one of the 4's.

3. I play one of the 1's.

4. Nene plays the other 4.

5. I play the other 1, scoring a point.

6. Nene plays 3, no score.

7. I play 3, no score.

8. Nene plays the remaining card, scoring a point if possible.

Wait, in this sequence, I still end up with 1 point.

Another sequence:

1. I play one 1.

2. Nene plays one 4.

3. I play 2.

4. Nene plays 3.

5. I play the other 1, scoring a point.

6. Nene plays the other 4, scoring a point.

7. Nene plays the remaining card.

Again, I get only 1 point.

It seems hard to get more than 1 point.

Let's look at another example:

n = 3

My cards: 1,2,3

Nene's cards: 1,2,3

Possible game:

1. I play 1.

2. Nene plays 1, scores a point.

3. I play 2.

4. Nene plays 2, scores a point.

5. I play 3.

6. Nene plays 3, scores a point.

I get 0 points.

Another possible game:

1. I play 2.

2. Nene plays 1.

3. I play 3.

4. Nene plays 2, scores a point.

5. I play 1, scores a point.

6. Nene plays 3, scores a point.

Again, I get only 1 point.

But according to the problem, in this case, the answer is 0.

Wait, in the output, for n=3, it's 0.

So, perhaps there's a better strategy where I get 0 points.

Wait, in the second sequence above, I got 1 point, but the answer is 0, meaning that if Nene plays optimally, she can prevent me from getting any points.

Let me think about that.

If Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will try to prevent me from scoring points.

In the first sequence, she scored 3 points, and I scored 1.

In the second sequence, she scored 3 points, and I scored 1 again.

Is there a way for her to play so that I don't score any points?

Let's try:

1. I play 1.

2. Nene plays 2.

3. I play 2.

4. Nene plays 3, scores a point.

5. I play 3.

6. Nene plays 1, scores a point.

In this case, I scored 0 points.

Ah, so depending on how Nene plays, she can prevent me from scoring any points.

Hence, the maximum I can get is 0.

So, in this case, the answer is 0.

Similarly, in the first example, it's 1.

I need to find a general strategy to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal play.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula.

First, let's think about pairs.

Since there are two cards for each number, if I have both cards of a number, I can play one, and then play the other later to score a point.

However, Nene can interfere with my plans.

Wait, in the first example, I have two 1's.

I played one 1 first, then the other later to score a point.

But Nene can play a different number in between, as she did.

In the n=3 case, I have one of each number, so I can't make any pairs.

Hence, I can't score any points.

Wait, but in the n=3 case, both me and Nene have one of each number.

So, whenever I play a number, Nene can play a different number, and only she can make pairs.

Hence, I get 0 points.

In the first example, I have two 1's, and Nene has two 4's.

So, I can try to play one 1, then the other later to score a point.

But Nene can play her pair to maximize her points.

Wait, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, but Nene can interfere by playing her pairs in a way that minimizes my points.

Wait, in the first example, I have one pair (two 1's), and I could get 1 point.

In the n=3 case, I have no pairs, and I get 0 points.

In the second example, n=8, with my cards being 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, I have pairs of 8 and 5.

Nene has the other pairs.

According to the output, I can get 2 points.

Probably, for each pair I have, I can get one point, assuming Nene doesn't interfere too much.

Wait, but in the first example, I have one pair, and I get one point.

In the second example, I have two pairs, and I get two points.

In the third example, n=8, with my cards being 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

So, I have one pair of 4's, and the answer is 1.

So, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, but limited by something.

Wait, in the first example, I have one pair and get one point.

In the second, two pairs, two points.

In the third, one pair, one point.

In the fourth, no pairs, zero points.

In the fifth, n=1, with my card being 1, and Nene has the other 1.

I can't make a pair, so zero points.

Hence, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, but limited by something.

Wait, in the third example, I have one pair, and I get one point.

But in the first example, I have one pair and get one point.

Wait, but in the first example, Nene also has one pair.

In the third example, I have one pair, Nene has pairs of other numbers.

Wait, perhaps it's not just the number of pairs I have.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum of the number of pairs I have and n/2.

Wait, in the first example, n=4, n/2=2, I have one pair, but I get one point.

In the second example, n=8, n/2=4, I have two pairs, and I get two points.

In the third example, n=8, n/2=4, I have one pair, and I get one point.

In the fourth example, n=3, n/2=1 (since n is integer division), I have zero pairs, get zero points.

In the fifth example, n=1, n/2=0, I have zero pairs, get zero points.

Wait, but in the third example, n=8, n/2=4, I have one pair, and I get one point, which is min(1,4)=1.

In the first example, min(1,2)=1.

In the second example, min(2,4)=2.

Seems like the formula is min(number of pairs I have, n/2).

Wait, but why n/2?

Because Nene can play her pairs in a way that minimizes my points.

Wait, perhaps Nene can play her pairs in a way that she maximizes her points and minimizes my points.

But in the first example, I have one pair, Nene has one pair.

If I play my pair in two turns, Nene can play her pair in between to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Hence, I can get one point from my pair.

Similarly, in the third example, I have one pair, and I can get one point.

Hence, the formula seems to hold.

So, the maximum number of points I can get is the minimum of the number of pairs I have and n/2.

Wait, but in the second example, I have two pairs, n=8, n/2=4, min(2,4)=2, which matches the output.

In the fourth example, I have no pairs, n=3, n/2=1, min(0,1)=0.

In the fifth example, n=1, n/2=0, min(0,0)=0.

Hence, the formula seems consistent with the sample inputs and outputs.

Therefore, the program provided seems to implement this logic correctly.

It counts the number of pairs I have by counting the frequencies in my hand and counting how many frequencies are equal to 2.

Then, it takes the minimum of that count and n/2.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{min(pairs, n // 2)}}\]
