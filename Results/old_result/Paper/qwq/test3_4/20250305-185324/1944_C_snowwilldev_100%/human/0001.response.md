Alright, I have this problem to solve. It involves a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to determine the final score based on their optimal plays. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, understanding the game mechanics:

- There's an array `a` of size `n`, and Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

- Players take turns, with Alice going first.

- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a`, deletes it from `a`, but does not add it to `c`.

- The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example:

- MEX of [2,2,1] is 0.

- MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2.

- MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4.

Given that, I need to find the final MEX when both players play optimally.

Looking at the provided program:

```python

from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):

print(func_1())

def func_1():

N = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

cnt = defaultdict(int)

for i in range(N):

cnt[a[i]] += 1

t = 0

for i in range(N + 1):

if cnt[i] == 1:

t += 1

if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:

return i

```

I need to determine if this program correctly solves the problem.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one using `func_1`.

2. In `func_1`, it reads `N` and the array `a`.

3. It counts the frequency of each element in `a` using a defaultdict.

4. It then iterates from 0 to `N`:

- If the count of `i` is 1, it increments `t`.

- If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or if `cnt[i]` is 0, it returns `i` as the MEX.

This seems too simplistic for the described game. Let's see why.

First, the MEX depends on the final content of `c`, which is influenced by both Alice's and Bob's choices.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which means she wants to have as many small non-negative integers in `c` as possible. Bob, however, wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to prevent Alice from including certain elements in `c`.

The game involves a sequence of choices where Alice selects elements to add to `c`, and Bob removes elements without adding to `c`. The final MEX of `c` is what we need to determine under optimal play.

The provided code seems to calculate the MEX based on the frequency of elements in `a`, but it doesn't consider the game's turn-based nature and the strategic decisions of both players.

Let's look at the first example to understand:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

In the first test case:

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

One possible game:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,0,1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[0,1]

- Alice picks 0, c=[1,0], a=[1]

- Bob picks 1, a=[]

Final c=[1,0], MEX=2

But is this the optimal outcome?

Let's consider another sequence:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[0,1,1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,1]

- Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[1]

- Bob picks 1, a=[]

Final c=[0,1], MEX=2

Again, MEX=2

Is it possible to achieve a higher MEX for Alice? Let's see:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,0,1]

- Bob picks 1, a=[0,0]

- Alice picks 0, c=[1,0], a=[0]

- Bob picks 0, a=[]

Final c=[1,0], MEX=2

Same MEX.

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[0,1,1]

- Bob picks 1, a=[0,1]

- Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[0]

- Bob picks 0, a=[]

Final c=[0,1], MEX=2

Again, MEX=2

It seems that MEX=2 is the best Alice can achieve, and Bob can prevent her from getting a higher MEX.

Now, looking at the code's logic:

- It counts frequencies: 0 appears twice, 1 appears twice.

- It iterates from 0 to 4:

- i=0: cnt[0]=2 (not 1), so t remains 0

- i=1: cnt[1]=2 (not 1), so t remains 0

- i=2: cnt[2]=0, so return 2

Which matches the expected output.

Wait, but in this case, the code correctly returned 2, which is the correct MEX.

Let's check the second test case:

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible game:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1

Another sequence:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[1,2], MEX=0

Wait, but the expected output is 1.

Is 1 the best Alice can achieve?

Let's see:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1

- Alice picks 2, c=[2], a=[0,1,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1,3]

- Alice picks 1, c=[2,1], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[2,1], MEX=0

So, depending on the choices, MEX can be 0 or 1. It seems that Bob can force MEX to be 0.

But the expected output is 1. Maybe I'm missing something.

Looking at the code:

- Counts frequencies: 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1

- Iterates from 0 to 4:

- i=0: cnt[0]=1, t=1

- i=1: cnt[1]=1, t=2 -> t >= 2, return 1

Which matches the expected output of 1.

But according to my earlier game play, Bob can force MEX to be 0, which contradicts the expected output.

Wait, perhaps I missed a better strategy for Alice.

Let's think differently.

Since Alice wants to maximize MEX, she should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`. Bob, to minimize MEX, would try to prevent Alice from including certain small integers in `c`.

Given that Alice can choose to add elements to `c`, and Bob can only delete elements, Bob's actions are limited to removing elements that Alice hasn't added to `c`.

Wait, actually, Bob can choose any element to delete on his turn, regardless of whether it's in `c` or not.

So, in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible optimal play:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1

Another possible play:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[1,2], MEX=0

So, depending on Alice's choices, MEX can be 0 or 1. Since Bob wants to minimize MEX, he would force MEX to be 0.

But the expected output is 1, which suggests that MEX=1 is achievable.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding Bob's strategy.

Wait, perhaps Bob can't force MEX to be 0 in this case.

Let's see:

If Alice picks 0 first, then Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3, c=[0,2], MEX=1

If Alice picks 1 first, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3, c=[1,2], MEX=0

So, Bob can force MEX to be 0 by picking 0 after Alice picks 1.

But the expected output is 1, which might indicate that Alice can force MEX to be 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Looking back at the code, it seems to calculate the MEX based on the frequency counts, but not simulating the game.

Let's see how the code processes the second test case:

a = [0,1,2,3]

cnt = {0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1}

t = 0

i=0: cnt[0]=1, t=1

i=1: cnt[1]=1, t=2, t >= 2, return 1

So, it returns 1, which matches the expected output.

But according to my earlier game play, MEX can be 0 or 1, depending on the choices.

Wait, maybe the code is correct in returning 1 as the MEX in this case, and Bob cannot force a lower MEX.

Looking back at the first test case:

a = [0,0,1,1]

cnt = {0:2, 1:2}

t=0

i=0: cnt[0]=2 !=1, t remains 0

i=1: cnt[1]=2 !=1, t remains 0

i=2: cnt[2]=0, return 2

Which matches the expected output of 2.

Another test case:

n=2, a=[1,1]

cnt = {1:2}

t=0

i=0: cnt[0]=0, return 0

Which matches the expected output of 0.

Seems correct for all provided test cases.

But I'm still unsure if the logic is sound.

Let me think about the logic behind the code.

The code seems to iterate from 0 to N and check the frequency of each number:

- If cnt[i] == 1, increment t.

- If t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0, return i.

I need to see if this logic correctly determines the MEX under optimal play.

Let me consider another example:

Suppose n=3, a=[0,1,1]

cnt = {0:1, 1:2}

t=0

i=0: cnt[0]=1, t=1

i=1: cnt[1]=2 !=1, t remains 1

i=2: cnt[2]=0, return 2

Is this correct?

Possible game plays:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,1]

- Bob picks 1, a=[1]

- Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[]

Final c=[0,1], MEX=2

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,1]

- Bob picks 0, a=[1]

- Alice picks 1, c=[1,1], a=[]

Final c=[1,1], MEX=0

So, depending on the choices, MEX can be 0 or 2.

Since Bob wants to minimize MEX, he can force it to be 0.

But the code returns 2, which doesn't match the possible minimum MEX that Bob can achieve.

This suggests that the code might be incorrect.

Wait, but in the second test case, the code returned 1, but according to my earlier analysis, Bob can force MEX to be 0.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

But in the provided test cases, it matched the expected outputs.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the logic is that the MEX is determined by the counts in a certain way.

Let me look for a different approach.

Considering that Alice wants to maximize MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, it's a game theory problem where both players make optimal moves.

The MEX depends on the final content of `c`, which is influenced by both players' actions.

Alice can choose which elements to add to `c`, and Bob can choose which elements to remove, including those that Alice hasn't added to `c`.

I need to find a way to determine the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` after the game ends, considering both players play optimally.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of who can control the inclusion of each number in `c`.

Let's consider that for each number i, if it appears an odd number of times in `a`, Alice can ensure it's in `c`, and if it appears an even number of times, Bob can ensure it's not in `c`.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let's think about the number of times each element appears:

- If an element appears only once, Alice can choose to include it in `c`.

- If it appears twice, Alice can include one, and Bob can delete the other, or vice versa.

Wait, more carefully:

- If an element appears only once, it must be included in `c` by Alice when she picks it.

- If it appears twice, Alice can choose to include one in `c`, and Bob can delete the other.

- If it appears an odd number of times, Alice can ensure at least one is in `c`.

- If it appears an even number of times, Bob can ensure that none end up in `c`.

Wait, is that correct?

Let's consider:

- For an element that appears once: Alice must include it in `c` when she picks it.

- For an element that appears twice: Alice can include one in `c`, and Bob can delete the other.

- For elements that appear more than twice, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the parity of the counts.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look back at the code's logic.

The code iterates from 0 to N and checks:

- If cnt[i] == 1, increment t.

- If t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0, return i.

In the first test case, a=[0,0,1,1], cnt={0:2,1:2}, t remains 0, returns 2.

In the second test case, a=[0,1,2,3], cnt={0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1}, t=1 then 2, returns 1.

In the third test case, a=[1,1], cnt={1:2}, t=0, returns 0.

Looking back, in the second test case, the code returns 1, but according to my earlier game play, Bob can force MEX to be 0.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Let me consider another example:

n=5, a=[0,1,2,3,4]

cnt={0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

t=1, then 2, returns 1

But in reality, Alice can include 0 and 1 in `c`, making MEX=2, but Bob can prevent that.

Wait, let's simulate:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3,4]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3,4]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3,4]

- Bob picks 3, a=[4]

- Alice picks 4, c=[0,2,4], a=[]

Final c=[0,2,4], MEX=1

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3,4]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3,4]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3,4]

- Bob picks 3, a=[4]

- Alice picks 4, c=[1,2,4], a=[]

Final c=[1,2,4], MEX=0

So, Bob can force MEX to be 0.

But the code would return 1 for this case, which doesn't match.

Hence, the code seems incorrect.

Wait, but in the provided test cases, it matches the expected outputs.

Perhaps the test cases are not comprehensive enough to catch the error.

Let me check the official solution or think of a correct approach.

Alternative approach:

- Consider that Alice wants as many small numbers in `c` as possible, while Bob wants to prevent that.

- For each number i from 0 to N, determine if it's possible for Alice to include it in `c`.

- The MEX will be the smallest i that Alice cannot include in `c`.

To determine if Alice can include i in `c`:

- If i appears an odd number of times, Alice can ensure it's in `c`.

- If i appears an even number of times, Bob can ensure it's not in `c`.

Wait, is that accurate?

Let's consider:

- If i appears only once, Alice will pick it and include in `c`.

- If i appears twice, Alice can pick one and include it, but Bob can pick the other and delete it, so Alice cannot guarantee it's in `c`.

- If i appears three times, Alice can pick two and include one, ensuring at least one is in `c`.

- If i appears four times, Bob can pick two, and Alice can pick two, but Bob can ensure that at least one is deleted.

Wait, perhaps it's about the parity of the count.

Generalizing:

- If the count of i is odd, Alice can ensure that at least one i is in `c`.

- If the count of i is even, Bob can ensure that no i is in `c`.

Hence, the final `c` will contain all i with odd counts.

Therefore, the MEX is the smallest i with count=0 or i with count=even.

Wait, but in the second test case, all numbers from 0 to 3 appear once, which is odd, so Alice can include all of them, making MEX=4.

But the expected output is 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the number of times a number appears doesn't directly translate to its inclusion in `c`, because Bob can delete elements in a way that affects Alice's choices.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the game's turn structure.

Each game has n turns, with Alice and Bob alternating, Alice going first.

In each of Alice's turns, she picks an element to add to `c` and deletes it from `a`.

In each of Bob's turns, he picks an element to delete from `a`.

So, in total, there are n deletions, with Alice choosing which element to add to `c` in her turns.

The final `c` will contain all the elements Alice chose to add, which is ceil(n/2) elements if n is odd, or n/2 if n is even.

Wait, no, Alice chooses which element to add in her turns, and Bob just deletes in his turns.

Wait, more precisely:

- Total turns: n, since each turn deletes one element.

- Alice's turns: ceil(n/2), since she starts first.

- Bob's turns: floor(n/2).

But Alice chooses which elements to add to `c` in her turns.

So, the final `c` will have ceil(n/2) elements, chosen by Alice, but Bob can influence which elements are available for Alice to choose.

This seems complex.

Let me think of it differently.

Perhaps I should consider that Alice can choose any ceil(n/2) elements to include in `c`, and Bob can choose the remaining floor(n/2) elements to delete.

So, Alice wants to select a subset of ceil(n/2) elements such that the MEX is maximized, and Bob is trying to minimize it.

This seems like a combinatorial game theory problem, potentially requiring a more sophisticated approach.

However, the provided code seems to be based on a simpler frequency count.

Given that, and considering the discrepancy in my earlier example, I think the provided code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
