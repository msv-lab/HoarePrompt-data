Alright, I have this problem to solve. It involves a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to determine the final score based on their optimal plays. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the game mechanics:

- There's an array `a` of size `n`, and Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

- Players take turns, with Alice going first.

- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a`, deletes it from `a`, but does not add it to `c`.

- The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example:

- MEX of [2,2,1] is 0.

- MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2.

- MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4.

Given that, I need to find out what the final MEX will be if both play optimally.

Looking at the provided program:

```python

from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):

print(func_1())

def func_1():

N = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

cnt = defaultdict(int)

for i in range(N):

cnt[a[i]] += 1

t = 0

for i in range(N + 1):

if cnt[i] == 1:

t += 1

if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:

return i

```

I need to determine if this program correctly solves the problem.

Let's analyze the approach:

1. **Counting occurrences:** The program counts how many times each number appears in the array using a dictionary `cnt`.

2. **Iterating to find MEX:** It then iterates from 0 to `N` and checks conditions based on the counts.

3. **Conditions:**

- If `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments a counter `t`.

- If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, it returns `i` as the MEX.

This seems too simplistic for the described game. Let's think about what the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob would be.

**Optimal Strategies:**

- **Alice's goal:** Maximize the MEX of `c`. To do this, she wants to include as many small non-negative integers in `c` as possible.

- **Bob's goal:** Minimize the MEX of `c`. He wants to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

Given that Alice can choose which elements to add to `c`, and Bob can remove elements from `a`, their strategies interact in a way that affects which elements end up in `c`.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Alice's choice:** She can select any element from `a` and add it to `c`. She will prefer to pick elements that help her achieve higher MEX.

2. **Bob's choice:** He can select any element from `a` and remove it, without adding to `c`. He will try to remove elements that Alice would want to add to `c` to maximize MEX.

3. **Turn order:** Alice goes first, then Bob, and so on, alternating turns until `a` is empty.

4. **MEX depends only on `c`:** The MEX is determined by the final content of `c`, which consists of elements chosen by Alice.

Given these points, I need to model how Alice and Bob's choices affect the final composition of `c`.

**Game Analysis:**

- Total turns: `n` turns, since `a` has `n` elements.

- Alice's turns: ceil(n/2), since she starts first.

- Bob's turns: floor(n/2).

However, this might not directly help. I need to think in terms of which elements can Alice ensure to include in `c`.

**Ensuring Inclusion in `c`:**

- If an element appears only once in `a`, Alice can ensure it goes into `c` by picking it on her turn. Bob cannot remove it because it's already chosen by Alice.

- If an element appears multiple times, Bob can try to prevent Alice from picking it by removing other copies.

Wait, but actually, since Bob can only delete elements on his turn without adding to `c`, the dynamics are different.

Let's think differently.

**Modeling the Game:**

- The game is about selecting elements to include in `c` (Alice) and excluding them (Bob).

- Since Alice picks and adds to `c`, and Bob picks and deletes without adding, Bob can influence which elements Alice can pick later.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

**Simplifying the Problem:**

- The MEX is about the smallest missing non-negative integer in `c`.

- To maximize MEX, Alice wants to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.

- Bob wants to minimize MEX by preventing Alice from including small integers in `c`.

- So, the game is about controlling which small integers end up in `c`.

**Focus on Small Integers:**

- Consider integers from 0 to N.

- For each integer i, determine if Alice can ensure that i is in `c` or not.

- The MEX will be the smallest i that Alice cannot ensure is in `c`.

**Optimal Play:**

- Alice will try to include the smallest possible i in `c`.

- Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible i.

This seems like a game where the outcome depends on who has the control over the inclusion of each i.

**Thinking in Terms of Necessary Steps:**

- For each i from 0 to N:

- Check if Alice can force i to be in `c`.

- If she can, then MEX cannot be i.

- If she cannot, then MEX is i.

So, the problem reduces to determining, for each i, whether Alice can ensure that i is in `c` despite Bob's efforts.

**How to Determine If Alice Can Ensure i is in c:**

- Alice can ensure i is in c if she can pick i on her turn before Bob can remove all instances of i.

- If there are multiple instances of i, Bob might try to remove them to prevent Alice from picking i.

- If cnt[i] is odd, and Alice starts, she can pick i on her turn if she chooses to.

- If cnt[i] is even, Bob can potentially remove one instance, making it odd, and then Alice can pick it.

Wait, this might not be accurate.

**Detailed Analysis for cnt[i]:**

- If cnt[i] > 0, Alice can pick it on her turn, adding it to `c`.

- Bob can try to remove other instances, but once Alice picks one, it's added to `c`.

So, if cnt[i] >=1, Alice can always pick i and add it to `c`, provided that Bob doesn't remove it before Alice can pick it.

Wait, but Bob can only remove elements on his turn, not add to `c`.

**Wait, re-reading the problem:**

- On Alice's turn: pick an element from a, append to c, and delete from a.

- On Bob's turn: pick an element from a, delete it from a.

So, once Alice picks an element and adds it to c, it's removed from a, and Bob cannot remove it anymore.

Bob can only remove elements that are still in a.

Therefore, Alice can choose to pick any remaining element and add it to c on her turn.

Bob can choose to remove any remaining element on his turn.

**Game Simulation:**

- The game alternates between Alice and Bob, with Alice going first.

- Alice wants to include elements in c to maximize MEX.

- Bob wants to exclude elements to minimize MEX.

- The MEX is determined by the final c.

**Strategy for Alice:**

- Alice should try to include the smallest possible integers in c to maximize the MEX.

- But Bob will try to prevent her from including the smallest integers.

**Key Insight:**

- For each integer i, count the number of times it appears in a, cnt[i].

- Alice can ensure that i is in c if cnt[i] is greater than the number of times Bob can remove it.

- Since Bob plays after Alice, and they alternate turns, the number of elements each can pick is determined by the total number of turns.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times Alice gets to pick elements.

**Total turns: n turns, Alice gets ceil(n/2) turns, Bob gets floor(n/2) turns.

- Alice can pick ceil(n/2) elements to add to c.

- Bob can remove floor(n/2) elements from a.

But Bob's removals can affect which elements Alice can pick.

This seems complicated.

**Alternative Approach:**

- Consider that Alice can select ceil(n/2) elements to include in c, and Bob can select floor(n/2) elements to exclude.

- The remaining elements in c will be those that Alice chooses to include.

- The MEX will be the smallest integer not in c.

- To maximize MEX, Alice wants to include as many small integers as possible.

- Bob wants to minimize MEX by preventing Alice from including small integers.

**Modeling the Selection Process:**

- Sort the unique elements in a.

- For each unique i in sorted order, check if Alice can include it in c.

- If she can, include it; else, MEX is i.

**Determining If Alice Can Include i in c:**

- If cnt[i] > 0, Alice can pick it on her turn and add it to c.

- However, Bob can try to remove other instances of i to prevent Alice from picking i.

Wait, but once Alice picks an instance of i and adds it to c, it's removed from a, and Bob cannot remove it anymore.

So, if cnt[i] >=1, Alice can always pick i and add it to c on her turn, provided that she gets to pick before Bob removes it.

But Bob can remove other elements, including i, on his turn.

Wait, Bob can remove any element from a on his turn, including i.

But if Alice picks i on her turn, she adds it to c and removes it from a before Bob's turn.

So, Bob cannot remove an i that Alice has already added to c.

Therefore, Alice can ensure that at least floor(cnt[i]/2) + 1 instances of i are in c.

Because for every two instances, Bob can remove one, but Alice can pick one.

If cnt[i] is odd, Alice can pick one more.

**General Rule:**

- For each i, the number of instances of i that Alice can ensure to be in c is ceil(cnt[i]/2).

- If ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, Alice can include at least one i in c.

- Therefore, for MEX purposes, if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, then i is in c.

- Else, i is not in c, and MEX is i.

**Wait, is this accurate?**

Let's test with examples.

**Example 1:**

Input:

4

0 0 1 1

Counts: 0:2, 1:2

Alice can ensure ceil(2/2)=1 instance of 0 and 1 in c.

So c contains at least one 0 and one 1.

MEX is 2.

Which matches the first sample.

**Example 2:**

Input:

4

0 1 2 3

Counts: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1

Alice can ensure ceil(1/2)=1 instance of each in c.

So c contains 0,1,2,3.

MEX is 4.

But the second sample output is 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the second sample is:

4

0 1 2 3

Output:1

But according to my earlier logic, MEX should be 4, but the output is 1.

Wait, perhaps my logic is flawed.

Let's look at the second sample.

**Second Sample Analysis:**

Input:

4

0 1 2 3

Counts: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1

Total elements: 4

Alice gets ceil(4/2)=2 picks.

Bob gets floor(4/2)=2 picks.

Alice can pick any two elements to include in c.

Bob can pick any two elements to remove.

Bob will try to remove elements that Alice wants to include to minimize MEX.

Assume Alice wants to include 0 and 1.

Bob can remove 0 and 1.

Then c would be empty.

Wait, but Bob cannot remove elements that Alice has already added to c.

Wait, once Alice picks an element and adds it to c, it's removed from a, so Bob cannot remove it.

So, if Alice picks 0 and 1, adds them to c, and removes them from a, then Bob can pick any remaining elements, but they are already removed.

So c would contain 0 and 1.

MEX would be 2.

But the sample output is 1.

Contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the sample.

Wait, checking the sample input and output:

Second test case:

4

0 1 2 3

Output:1

Wait, perhaps the array is different.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"4

0 1 2 3

Output:1"

Wait, perhaps there is a typo in the problem statement, or I misread it.

Wait, looking back:

"Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0"

Wait, first test case:

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

Output:2

Second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Output:1

Third test case:

n=2

a=[1,1]

Output:0

Wait, for the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], output=1.

According to my earlier logic, Alice can include two elements in c, and Bob can remove two elements.

But no matter which two elements Alice includes, Bob can remove the other two.

But once Alice includes them, Bob cannot remove them.

So c would have two elements, say 0 and 1, MEX is 2.

But sample output is 1, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

**Revised Approach:**

- The game is about selecting elements to include in c (by Alice) and excluding elements (by Bob).

- The final MEX depends on which elements are in c.

- Alice wants to maximize MEX, so she wants to include as many small integers as possible in c.

- Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including small integers in c.

- The game is a zero-sum game, and we need to find the MEX when both play optimally.

**Game Theory Insight:**

- This resembles a selection game where Alice and Bob have opposing goals regarding the composition of c.

- The optimal strategy involves Alice trying to include the smallest possible integers, and Bob trying to block her.

**Optimal Strategy:**

- Alice should prioritize including the smallest integers possible.

- Bob should prioritize preventing Alice from including the smallest integers.

- The MEX will be the smallest integer that Alice cannot include in c despite her best efforts.

**Simulating the Game:**

- Consider the smallest integers first.

- For each integer i from 0 to N:

- Check if Alice can ensure that i is included in c.

- If she can, proceed to the next integer.

- If she cannot, then i is the MEX.

**Determining If Alice Can Include i in c:**

- If cnt[i] > 0, Alice can pick it on her turn and add it to c.

- Bob can try to remove instances of i to prevent Alice from picking it.

- However, since Alice picks first and can choose which element to pick, she can prioritize picking i if it's available.

- If cnt[i] >=1, Alice can pick it on her turn and add it to c.

- Bob cannot remove it once Alice has added it to c.

Therefore, Alice can always include at least one instance of i in c if cnt[i] >=1.

Wait, but the sample input suggests otherwise.

Wait, in the second sample:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Counts: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1

Alice can pick two elements to include in c.

Bob can remove two elements.

If Alice picks 0 and 1, Bob can remove 2 and 3.

Then c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.

Wait, checking the sample input and output again:

"4

0 1 2 3

Output:1"

Wait, perhaps the array is different.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's:

"4

0 1 2 3

Output:1"

But according to my earlier logic, MEX should be 2, but it's 1.

Wait, maybe the array is [0,1,2,3], and the output is 1.

This suggests that c does not contain 0 or 1.

But according to my logic, Alice can include 0 and 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

**Alternative Perspective:**

- The game is about selecting elements to include in c, with Alice trying to maximize MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.

- The MEX is determined by the final c.

- To find the optimal MEX, we need to see which is the smallest integer that Alice cannot guarantee to include in c.

- If Alice can include all integers from 0 to k-1 in c, then MEX is k.

- We need to find the smallest k such that Alice cannot include k in c.

**Optimal Play Analysis:**

- For each integer i from 0 to N:

- Determine if Alice can include i in c despite Bob's attempts to prevent it.

- If Alice can include i, proceed to the next integer.

- If she cannot, then MEX is i.

**Condition for Alice to Include i:**

- If cnt[i] >=1, Alice can pick it on her turn and add it to c.

- Bob cannot remove it once it's added to c.

- Therefore, Alice can always include i if cnt[i] >=1.

- Hence, the MEX should be the smallest i where cnt[i]==0.

But according to the sample, this is not the case.

In the second sample:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Counts: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1

According to this, MEX should be 4, but the output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the game mechanics.

**Re-examining the Game Mechanics:**

- Alice and Bob take turns deleting elements from a, with Alice also adding to c on her turn.

- The game ends when a is empty.

- The MEX is of c, which contains elements chosen by Alice.

- Alice wants to maximize MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

**Key Point:**

- Alice can choose which elements to include in c.

- Bob can choose which elements to delete, potentially preventing Alice from including certain elements.

But once Alice includes an element in c, it's fixed.

**Optimal Strategy Revisited:**

- Alice should pick the smallest available integer on her turn to include in c.

- Bob should pick the smallest available integer that Alice would want to include.

- This is a game of selecting the smallest available integers, with Alice and Bob having opposing goals.

**Simulating the Game:**

Let's simulate the second sample:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Turns:

1. Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

2. Bob picks 0 (but 0 is already removed), so he picks 1, a=[2,3]

3. Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[2,3]

4. Bob picks 2, a=[3]

5. Alice picks 2, c=[0,1,2], a=[3]

6. Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,1,2], MEX=3

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the turn order or the rules.

Wait, more carefully:

- On Alice's turn: pick an element from a, append to c, and delete it from a.

- On Bob's turn: pick an element from a, delete it from a.

- The game ends when a is empty.

- The MEX is of c.

In the second sample:

- n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible game play:

1. Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

2. Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

3. Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

4. Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1

Ah, in this scenario, c does not contain 1, so MEX is 1.

Alternative play:

1. Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

2. Bob picks 2, a=[1,3]

3. Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[3]

4. Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,1], MEX=2

Another play:

1. Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

2. Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

3. Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

4. Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[1,2], MEX=0

Wait, in this case, c does not contain 0, so MEX is 0.

But the sample output is 1, not 0.

Wait, confusion here.

Wait, perhaps the optimal play leads to MEX=1.

Let's consider another play:

1. Alice picks 2, c=[2], a=[0,1,3]

2. Bob picks 0, a=[1,3]

3. Alice picks 1, c=[2,1], a=[3]

4. Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[2,1], MEX=0

Again, MEX is 0.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps there's a different optimal play.

Alternative play:

1. Alice picks 3, c=[3], a=[0,1,2]

2. Bob picks 0, a=[1,2]

3. Alice picks 1, c=[3,1], a=[2]

4. Bob picks 2, a=[]

Final c=[3,1], MEX=0

Still MEX=0.

But sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps the optimal play is different.

Wait, maybe Bob can force a higher MEX.

Alternative play:

1. Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

2. Bob picks 2, a=[1,3]

3. Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[3]

4. Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,1], MEX=2

Still not matching the sample output of 1.

Wait, perhaps the optimal play leads to MEX=1 in some way.

Wait, maybe if Alice picks 2 first:

1. Alice picks 2, c=[2], a=[0,1,3]

2. Bob picks 0, a=[1,3]

3. Alice picks 1, c=[2,1], a=[3]

4. Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[2,1], MEX=0

Which is worse for Bob, since lower MEX is better for him.

Wait, but sample output is 1, which is better than 0.

Wait, perhaps in optimal play, MEX=1 is achievable.

Wait, maybe there's a different interpretation.

**Re-examining the Problem:**

- Alice wants to maximize MEX of c.

- Bob wants to minimize MEX of c.

- MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in c.

- So, lower MEX is better for Bob, higher MEX for Alice.

- They play optimally.

In the second sample, output is 1.

But according to my simulations, MEX can be 0 or 2.

Why is the output 1?

Wait, perhaps the optimal play leads to MEX=1.

Let me consider another play:

1. Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

2. Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

3. Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

4. Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1

Ah, here MEX is 1.

So, depending on the plays, MEX can be 0,1, or 2.

But how to determine the optimal MEX?

**Optimal Play Conclusion:**

- Alice wants to include as many small integers as possible.

- Bob wants to prevent Alice from including small integers.

- The final MEX is determined by the smallest integer not included in c.

Given that, the optimal MEX is the smallest integer where the number of available instances is not sufficient for Alice to include it in c, considering Bob's interference.

**Formalizing the Solution:**

- For each integer i from 0 to N:

- If cnt[i] >=1, Alice can include it in c.

- If cnt[i] ==0, MEX is i.

But in the sample, even if cnt[i]>=1, MEX can be higher or lower based on Bob's actions.

Wait, in the second sample, cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1.

Alice can include two of them, but Bob can force c to miss one, hence MEX=1.

Wait, perhaps the condition is:

- For each i, check if cnt[i] > floor(cnt[i]/2).

- Wait, that doesn't make sense.

**Correct Approach:**

- Alice can include ceil(cnt[i]/2) instances of i in c.

- If ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, then i is in c.

- Else, i is not in c.

- The MEX is the smallest i where ceil(cnt[i]/2) ==0.

Wait, ceil(cnt[i]/2) ==0 only if cnt[i]==0.

Wait, no, ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2, etc.

So, ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1 for cnt[i] >=1.

Thus, according to this, MEX is the smallest i where cnt[i]==0.

But in the second sample, cnt[i]==1 for i=0,1,2,3, so MEX should be 4.

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts.

Hence, my earlier assumption is wrong.

**Revisiting the Approach:**

- The issue is that Bob can influence which elements Alice includes in c.

- Even if cnt[i]>=1, Bob might be able to prevent Alice from including i in c.

- Hence, the earlier approach is incomplete.

**New Insight:**

- The game is about the parity of the counts and the turn order.

- Alice gets ceil(n/2) turns to pick elements and add them to c.

- Bob gets floor(n/2) turns to remove elements from a.

- The final c contains the elements Alice picked.

- The MEX is the smallest integer not in c.

- To maximize MEX, Alice should pick the smallest available integers.

- To minimize MEX, Bob should prevent Alice from picking the smallest integers.

**Optimal Strategies:**

- Alice will always pick the smallest available integer that she can include in c.

- Bob will try to remove elements that Alice would want to pick.

**Algorithm to Determine MEX:**

- Sort the unique elements of a.

- For each unique i in sorted order:

- If cnt[i] > 0, Alice can pick it and include it in c.

- Bob can try to remove elements to prevent Alice from picking i.

- If Alice has enough turns to pick i before Bob can remove all instances of i, then i is in c.

- Else, i is not in c, and MEX is i.

**Formalizing the Condition:**

- For each i:

- If cnt[i] > floor((n - cnt[i]) / 2), then Alice can include at least one i in c.

- Else, Bob can prevent Alice from including i in c.

- The MEX is the smallest i where Alice cannot include i in c.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

- For each i, the number of times Alice can include i in c is ceil(cnt[i] / 2).

- If ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, then i is in c.

- Else, i is not in c.

- Hence, MEX is the smallest i where ceil(cnt[i]/2) ==0, which is when cnt[i]==0.

But again, this doesn't match the sample.

Wait, perhaps the condition is different.

**Revisiting the Second Sample:**

- n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1

- Alice can pick 2 elements to include in c.

- Bob can remove 2 elements.

- If Alice picks 0 and 1, Bob removes 2 and 3, c=[0,1], MEX=2

- If Alice picks 0 and 2, Bob removes 1 and 3, c=[0,2], MEX=1

- If Alice picks 0 and 3, Bob removes 1 and 2, c=[0,3], MEX=1

- If Alice picks 1 and 2, Bob removes 0 and 3, c=[1,2], MEX=0

- If Alice picks 1 and 3, Bob removes 0 and 2, c=[1,3], MEX=0

- If Alice picks 2 and 3, Bob removes 0 and 1, c=[2,3], MEX=0

- The possible MEX values are 0,1,2.

- The minimal possible MEX that Bob can force is 0, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, confusion here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the MEX when both play optimally, meaning Alice maximizes MEX and Bob minimizes it.

So, Alice will try to achieve the highest possible MEX, while Bob will try to bring it down.

In this scenario, the optimal MEX is the highest MEX that Alice can guarantee, given Bob's opposition.

In the second sample, possible MEX values are 0,1,2.

Alice can guarantee MEX=1 by picking 0 and 1, and Bob can prevent MEX from being higher than 1.

Hence, the output is 1.

**General Solution Approach:**

- For each i from 0 to N:

- Check if Alice can include i in c, considering Bob's attempts to prevent it.

- If Alice can include i, proceed to the next i.

- If not, MEX is i.

- To include i, Alice needs to pick it before Bob can remove all instances of i.

- If cnt[i] > floor(n/2), Alice can include at least one i in c.

- Else, Bob can prevent Alice from including i in c.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

- If cnt[i] > floor((n + 1)/2), Alice can include at least
