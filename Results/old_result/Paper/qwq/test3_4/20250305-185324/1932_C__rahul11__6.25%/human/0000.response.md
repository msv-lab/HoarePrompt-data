Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, a positive integer m, and a string of commands consisting of 'L's and 'R's. For each command, I need to output the product of the current array elements modulo m, and then remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This process repeats for all commands in the string.

First, I need to understand the input and output formats. The input consists of multiple test cases, starting with an integer t indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: the first line has two integers n and m, where n is the length of the array and m is the modulus. The second line contains n integers, which are the elements of the array. The third line is a string s of length n consisting of 'L's and 'R's, which are the commands.

The output should be n integers for each test case, where each integer is the product of the current array elements modulo m, printed in order for each command.

Looking at the example provided, it seems that the product is calculated before any removals, and then after each removal, the product is recalculated for the next step.

I need to make sure that my program handles multiple test cases correctly and efficiently, especially since the constraints mention that the sum of n across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, which means I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me think about how to compute the product modulo m efficiently at each step without recomputing the entire product each time.

One straightforward way is to keep track of the current product and update it by dividing out the element that's being removed. However, division in modular arithmetic is a bit tricky because direct division isn't allowed. Instead, I can multiply by the modular inverse.

But wait, in the given program, I see that they're using integer division (`ans // arr[l] % MOD`), which might not be correct in modular arithmetic. I need to verify if this is acceptable.

Moreover, the modulus is m, which can be as small as 1, but in the code, they're using an additional modulus operation with MOD, which is 10^9 + 6. I need to understand why they're doing that.

Let's look at the code step by step.

The function `func` is defined, and it seems to handle multiple test cases. It reads t, the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads n and m, the array arr, and the string s.

It initializes a list res with n zeros, which will store the results for each step.

It calculates the initial product ans of all elements in arr and sets res[0] to ans % m % MOD.

Then it sets c = 1, l = 0, and r = n - 1. c seems to be an index for the res list, l is the left pointer, and r is the right pointer for the array.

Then there's a loop that runs from k = 0 to n-2 (since it's range(n-1)).

In each iteration, depending on whether s[k] is 'L' or 'R', it divides ans by arr[l] or arr[r] and updates ans accordingly, then sets res[c] to ans % m % MOD, and moves the pointer l or r accordingly.

Finally, it prints the res list for the test case.

First potential issue: In modular arithmetic, division isn't straightforward. To divide by a number, you need to multiply by its modular inverse. However, in the code, they're using integer division, which is likely incorrect in the context of modular arithmetic.

For example, if ans is the product modulo m, and I want to divide by arr[l], I should multiply ans by the modular inverse of arr[l] modulo m, provided that arr[l] is invertible modulo m (i.e., gcd(arr[l], m) == 1).

But in the code, they're directly using integer division, which will not compute the correct modular result.

This suggests a mistake in the code.

Second potential issue: The use of an additional modulus MOD, which is set to 10^9 + 6. I'm not sure why they're using this. The problem only specifies taking the product modulo m, not an additional modulus.

Looking back at the example outputs, I don't see any large numbers that would require an additional modulus; the outputs are all small numbers.

Perhaps the coder is trying to handle large products by taking an intermediate modulus, but this is unnecessary because m can be as small as 1, and we're supposed to compute the product modulo m directly.

Moreover, using an additional modulus MOD might lead to incorrect results if m and MOD aren't handled properly.

Third potential issue: The initial calculation of ans is the product of all elements in arr, but this product can be extremely large, potentially beyond the range of standard integer types. In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so this shouldn't be a problem, but taking the modulus m at each step would prevent the numbers from becoming too large.

However, in the code, they're taking ans % m % MOD after each division, which might not be necessary and could introduce errors.

Fourth potential issue: The code uses list indices directly, assuming that the commands are processed in order, but I need to ensure that the pointers l and r correctly reflect the removals specified by the commands.

Let me consider an example to see if this works.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 4, m = 6

arr = [3, 1, 4, 2]

s = "LRRL"

Processing:

1. Output product modulo 6: (3*1*4*2) % 6 = 24 % 6 = 0

Then, s[0] = 'L', remove leftmost element 3, arr becomes [1, 4, 2]

2. Output product modulo 6: (1*4*2) % 6 = 8 % 6 = 2

s[1] = 'R', remove rightmost element 2, arr becomes [1, 4]

3. Output product modulo 6: (1*4) % 6 = 4 % 6 = 4

s[2] = 'R', remove rightmost element 4, arr becomes [1]

4. Output product modulo 6: 1 % 6 = 1

s[3] = 'L', remove leftmost element 1, arr becomes empty

So the output should be: 0 2 4 1

Now, let's see what the code does for this case.

Initialization:

res = [0,0,0,0]

ans = 3*1*4*2 = 24

res[0] = 24 % 6 % MOD = 0 % MOD = 0

c = 1, l = 0, r = 3

First iteration (k=0):

s[0] = 'L', so ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD = 24 // 3 % MOD = 8 % MOD = 8

res[1] = 8 % 6 % MOD = 2 % MOD = 2

l += 1, so l = 1

Second iteration (k=1):

s[1] = 'R', so ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD = 8 // 2 % MOD = 4 % MOD = 4

res[2] = 4 % 6 % MOD = 4 % MOD = 4

r -= 1, so r = 2

Third iteration (k=2):

s[2] = 'R', so ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD = 4 // 2 % MOD = 2 % MOD = 2

res[3] = 2 % 6 % MOD = 2 % MOD = 2

r -= 1, so r = 1

Wait, but according to the example, the fourth output should be 1, but according to this, it's 2. So there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, in the third iteration, r is set to 2, then arr[r] is arr[2] = 4, but in the example, after two removals, arr should be [1,4], so arr[1] = 4, which matches.

But according to the code, ans is set to 4 // 2 = 2, and then res[3] is 2 % 6 = 2, but in the example, it's 1.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the division in modular arithmetic.

In the first step, ans = 24, which is correct.

Then, s[0] = 'L', remove 3, so ans should be 24 / 3 = 8, which is correct.

Then, s[1] = 'R', remove 2, so ans should be 8 / 2 = 4, which is correct.

Then, s[2] = 'R', remove 4, so ans should be 4 / 4 = 1, which should give res[3] = 1 % 6 = 1, which matches the example.

But in the code, it seems to be giving 2 instead of 1.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Let's trace the code again.

Initialization:

res = [0,0,0,0]

ans = 3*1*4*2 = 24

res[0] = 24 % 6 % MOD = 0

c = 1, l = 0, r = 3

First iteration (k=0):

s[0] = 'L', ans = 24 // 3 % MOD = 8 % MOD = 8

res[1] = 8 % 6 % MOD = 2 % MOD = 2

l = 1

Second iteration (k=1):

s[1] = 'R', ans = 8 // arr[r] % MOD = 8 // 2 % MOD = 4 % MOD = 4

res[2] = 4 % 6 % MOD = 4 % MOD = 4

r = 2

Third iteration (k=2):

s[2] = 'R', ans = 4 // arr[r] % MOD = 4 // 4 % MOD = 1 % MOD = 1

res[3] = 1 % 6 % MOD = 1 % MOD = 1

So, res = [0,2,4,1], which matches the example.

Wait, earlier I thought it was giving 2, but actually, in this trace, it gives 1.

Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier trace.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier trace, I thought ans was 4, then divided by arr[r] = 4, giving ans = 1, which is correct.

So, maybe the code is correct.

But I recall that division in modular arithmetic isn't straightforward, and using integer division might not always work.

Let me think of another test case.

Take the second example:

n = 5, m = 1

arr = [1,1,1,1,1]

s = "LLLLL"

Since m = 1, any product modulo 1 is 0.

So, output should be 0 0 0 0 0

Let's see what the code does.

Initialization:

res = [0,0,0,0,0]

ans = 1*1*1*1*1 = 1

res[0] = 1 % 1 % MOD = 0 % MOD = 0

c = 1, l = 0, r = 4

First iteration (k=0):

s[0] = 'L', ans = 1 // 1 % MOD = 1 % MOD = 1

res[1] = 1 % 1 % MOD = 0 % MOD = 0

l = 1

Second iteration (k=1):

s[1] = 'L', ans = 1 // 1 % MOD = 1 % MOD = 1

res[2] = 1 % 1 % MOD = 0 % MOD = 0

l = 2

Third iteration (k=2):

s[2] = 'L', ans = 1 // 1 % MOD = 1 % MOD = 1

res[3] = 1 % 1 % MOD = 0 % MOD = 0

l = 3

Fourth iteration (k=3):

s[3] = 'L', ans = 1 // 1 % MOD = 1 % MOD = 1

res[4] = 1 % 1 % MOD = 0 % MOD = 0

l = 4

So, res = [0,0,0,0,0], which matches the example.

Another test case:

n = 6, m = 8

arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

s = "RLLLRR"

Compute step by step:

Initial product: 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720

res[0] = 720 % 8 = 0

s[0] = 'R', remove 6, arr = [1,2,3,4,5], ans = 720 / 6 = 120

res[1] = 120 % 8 = 0

s[1] = 'L', remove 1, arr = [2,3,4,5], ans = 120 / 2 = 60

res[2] = 60 % 8 = 4

s[2] = 'L', remove 2, arr = [3,4,5], ans = 60 / 3 = 20

res[3] = 20 % 8 = 4

s[3] = 'L', remove 3, arr = [4,5], ans = 20 / 4 = 5

res[4] = 5 % 8 = 5

s[4] = 'R', remove 5, arr = [4], ans = 5 / 5 = 1

res[5] = 1 % 8 = 1

But according to the example, it should be 0 0 0 4 4 4

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

In my calculation, res should be [0,0,4,4,5,1], but the example shows [0,0,0,4,4,4]

This suggests that my manual calculation might be wrong or that there's an error in the code.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Let's recalculate:

Initial product: 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720

res[0] = 720 % 8 = 0

s[0] = 'R', remove 6, arr = [1,2,3,4,5], ans = 720 / 6 = 120

res[1] = 120 % 8 = 0

s[1] = 'L', remove 1, arr = [2,3,4,5], ans = 120 / 2 = 60

res[2] = 60 % 8 = 4

s[2] = 'L', remove 2, arr = [3,4,5], ans = 60 / 3 = 20

res[3] = 20 % 8 = 4

s[3] = 'L', remove 3, arr = [4,5], ans = 20 / 4 = 5

res[4] = 5 % 8 = 5

s[4] = 'R', remove 5, arr = [4], ans = 5 / 5 = 1

res[5] = 1 % 8 = 1

But the example shows [0,0,0,4,4,4]

This suggests that either the example is incorrect or the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps in the last step, ans should be 5 / 5 = 1, but according to the example, it's 4.

Wait, arr = [4], so product is 4, 4 % 8 = 4, so res[5] should be 4, not 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the last step.

Let's see:

After s[3] = 'L', remove 3, arr = [4,5], ans = 20 / 4 = 5

Then s[4] = 'R', remove 5, arr = [4], ans = 5 / 5 = 1

But wait, arr = [4], product is 4, so ans should be 4, not 1.

Ah, I see the mistake. When I remove 5, ans should be 5 / 5 = 1, but arr = [4], so product is 4, but according to the code, ans is being divided by arr[r] = 5, so ans = 5 / 5 = 1, but the actual product is 4.

So, there's inconsistency here.

This suggests that the code is incorrect because it's not maintaining the correct product after removals.

So, the division approach isn't preserving the actual product of the remaining elements.

Hence, the code is flawed.

Alternative approach:

To handle this correctly, I need to maintain the product of the current array modulo m, and update it properly when removing elements.

In modular arithmetic, to divide by a number, I need to multiply by its modular inverse, provided that the number is invertible modulo m (i.e., gcd(number, m) == 1).

If m is not prime, I need to handle cases where the element to be removed is not invertible.

But in this problem, m can be any integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, so it can be any positive integer, possibly with multiple factors.

This complicates things because if an element to be removed is not invertible modulo m, then I can't simply divide by it.

Moreover, computing modular inverses for each removal could be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t can be up to 10^4, but with the sum of n across all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5.

I need an efficient way to handle this.

An alternative approach is to precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m, and then for each step, determine which part of the array remains based on the commands up to that point.

Wait, but since the commands are given in a string, and I need to process them in order, removing either the leftmost or rightmost element each time, I need to keep track of the remaining array dynamically.

This seems tricky with prefix and suffix products.

Another idea is to simulate the process, keeping track of the current product modulo m, and updating it appropriately when removing elements.

But again, removing elements from the left or right and updating the product correctly is non-trivial, especially with modulus.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product of the remaining array modulo m, and update it by dividing (using modular inverse) the removed element at each step.

But as I thought earlier, this would require computing modular inverses, which could be time-consuming if done naively.

Is there a way to precompute the modular inverses for all elements that are invertible modulo m?

Actually, even better, since m is small (up to 10^4), I can precompute the modular inverses for all numbers from 1 to m that are coprime with m.

But handling the cases where elements are not invertible is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can factor m into its prime factors and handle each prime power separately, but that might be overkill.

Let me think differently.

Another approach is to compute the product of the entire array modulo m, and then, for each step, divide by the element being removed using modular inverse if possible, and keep track of the product modulo m.

However, as I noted, if an element is not invertible modulo m, this approach fails.

But in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that all elements a_i are at least 1, but m can be any positive integer, so elements may or may not be invertible modulo m.

This seems problematic.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product modulo m, and then when removing an element, divide the current product by that element, but using integer division, not modular division.

But as I saw in the earlier example, this doesn't always give the correct result.

Wait, in the example I tried earlier, using integer division seemed to work, but only because m divided the product evenly.

But in general, this might not be the case.

Wait, no, in the first example, m=6, and the product was 24, which is divisible by 6, but in other cases, it might not be.

Wait, actually, 24 % 6 = 0, but 24 // 3 = 8, and 8 % 6 = 2, which matched the example.

But in the second example with m=1, any product modulo 1 is 0, which also matched.

In the third example, there was a discrepancy, but perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps using integer division is acceptable in this problem because we're only interested in the product modulo m, and integer division might coincidentally give the correct result in some cases.

But I'm not sure if this is a general approach.

Let me consider another test case.

Suppose n=3, m=5, arr=[2,3,4], s="LRL"

Step 1: product = 2*3*4=24, 24 % 5 = 4, output 4

Remove 'L': remove 2, arr=[3,4]

Step 2: product=3*4=12, 12 % 5 = 2, output 2

Remove 'R': remove 4, arr=[3]

Step 3: product=3, 3 % 5 = 3, output 3

So the output should be 4 2 3

Now, let's see what the given code does.

Initialization:

res = [0,0,0]

ans = 2*3*4=24

res[0] = 24 % 5 % MOD = 4

c=1, l=0, r=2

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='L', ans=24 // 2 % MOD = 12 % MOD = 12

res[1] = 12 % 5 % MOD = 2

l=1

Second iteration (k=1):

s[1]='R', ans=12 // 4 % MOD = 3 % MOD = 3

res[2] = 3 % 5 % MOD = 3

r=1

So, res=[4,2,3], which matches the expected output.

Another test case where m does not divide the product evenly, and elements are invertible, seems to work.

But earlier, I had a discrepancy in another test case, so perhaps there's a fundamental flaw in this approach.

Wait, perhaps using integer division is acceptable when m divides the product after removing the element.

But I need to ensure that ans after division is indeed the product of the remaining elements modulo m.

In the earlier case where n=6, m=8, s="RLLLRR", there was a discrepancy, but perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me try that again.

n=6, m=8, arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6], s="RLLLRR"

Initial product: 1*2*3*4*5*6=720, 720 % 8 = 0

res[0]=0

s[0]='R', remove 6, arr=[1,2,3,4,5], product=1*2*3*4*5=120, 120 % 8 = 0

res[1]=0

s[1]='L', remove 1, arr=[2,3,4,5], product=2*3*4*5=120, 120 % 8 = 0

res[2]=0

s[2]='L', remove 2, arr=[3,4,5], product=3*4*5=60, 60 % 8 = 4

res[3]=4

s[3]='L', remove 3, arr=[4,5], product=4*5=20, 20 % 8 = 4

res[4]=4

s[4]='R', remove 5, arr=[4], product=4, 4 % 8 =4

res[5]=4

So, the expected output is 0 0 0 4 4 4, which matches the example.

But in my earlier manual calculation, I mistakenly set ans=5 after removing 5, which was incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is correct after all.

Wait, but in the code, they're using ans // arr[l] % MOD or ans // arr[r] % MOD, which seems to work in these cases.

But is this approach generally correct?

I think in cases where m divides the product after removing the element, integer division will give the correct result.

But in general, if m does not divide the product, this approach might fail.

Let me consider another test case.

n=3, m=5, arr=[2,3,4], s="LRL"

As I did earlier, it worked.

Another test case:

n=2, m=3, arr=[2,2], s="LL"

Step 1: product=2*2=4, 4 % 3 =1, output 1

Remove 'L': remove 2, arr=[2]

Step 2: product=2, 2 % 3=2, output 2

So, expected output:1 2

In the code:

res=[0,0]

ans=2*2=4

res[0]=4 % 3 % MOD=1

c=1, l=0, r=1

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='L', ans=4 // 2 % MOD=2 % MOD=2

Step 1: product=2*3=6, 6 % 3=0, output 0

Remove 'R': remove 3, arr=[2]

So, expected output:0 2

In the code:

res=[0,0]

ans=2*3=6

So, res=[2,2], which matches.

Another test case:

n=2, m=5, arr=[2,5], s="RL"

Step 1: product=2*5=10, 10 % 5=0, output 0

Remove 'R': remove 5, arr=[2]

Step 2: product=2, 2 % 5=2, output 2

In the code:

res=[0,0]

ans=2*5=10

res[0]=10 % 5 % MOD=0

c=1, l=0, r=1

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='R', ans=10 // 5 % MOD=2 % MOD=2

res[1]=2 % 5 % MOD=2

So, res=[0,2], which matches.

Another test case:

n=2, m=4, arr=[2,4], s="LL"

Step 1: product=2*4=8, 8 % 4=0, output 0

Remove 'L': remove 2, arr=[4]

Step 2: product=4, 4 % 4=0, output 0

In the code:

res=[0,0]

ans=2*4=8

res[0]=8 % 4 % MOD=0

c=1, l=0, r=1

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='L', ans=8 // 2 % MOD=4 % MOD=4

res[1]=4 % 4 % MOD=0

So, res=[0,0], which matches.

Another test case:

n=2, m=3, arr=[3,3], s="LL"

Step 1: product=3*3=9, 9 % 3=0, output 0

Remove 'L': remove 3, arr=[3]

Step 2: product=3, 3 % 3=0, output 0

In the code:

res=[0,0]

ans=3*3=9

res[0]=9 % 3 % MOD=0

c=1, l=0, r=1

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='L', ans=9 // 3 % MOD=3 % MOD=3

res[1]=3 % 3 % MOD=0

So, res=[0,0], which matches.

Another test case:

n=2, m=4, arr=[2,3], s="RR"

Step 1: product=2*3=6, 6 % 4=2, output 2

Remove 'R': remove 3, arr=[2]

Step 2: product=2, 2 % 4=2, output 2

In the code:

res=[0,0]

ans=2*3=6

c=1, l=0, r=1

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='R', ans=6 // 3 % MOD=2 % MOD=2

So, res=[2,2], which matches.

Another test case:

Step 1: product=2*3*4=24, 24 % 5=4, output 4

Step 2: product=2*3=6, 6 % 5=1, output 1

Remove 'R': remove 3, arr=[2]

Step 3: product=2, 2 % 5=2, output 2

So, expected output:4 1 2

In the code:

Second iteration (k=1):

s[1]='R', ans=6 // 3 % MOD=2 % MOD=2

res[2]=2 % 5 % MOD=2

r=0

So, res=[4,1,2], which matches.

Another test case:

n=3, m=7, arr=[1,2,3], s="LRR"

Step 1: product=1*2*3=6, 6 % 7=6, output 6

Remove 'L': remove 1, arr=[2,3]

Step 2: product=2*3=6, 6 % 7=6, output 6

Remove 'R': remove 3, arr=[2]

Step 3: product=2, 2 % 7=2, output 2

c=1, l=0, r=2

First iteration (k=0):

res[2]=2 % 7 % MOD=2

r=1

So, res=[6,6,2], which matches.

Given that in all these test cases, the code seems to produce the correct output using integer division, perhaps this approach is generally correct.

I need to think about why this works.

When we remove an element from the array and update the product by integer dividing by that element, as long as the element divides the current product, this should give the correct product of the remaining elements.

Then, taking this updated product modulo m should give the same result as computing the product of the remaining elements directly modulo m.

But is this always true?

Suppose the product of the array is P, and we remove an element x, which divides P.

Then, P // x is the product of the remaining elements.

Then, (P // x) % m should be equal to (P / x) % m, which is correct.

But in modular arithmetic, division is defined as multiplication by the modular inverse, not integer division.

However, in this specific case, since x divides P, P // x is an integer, and (P // x) % m is correct.

But what if x does not divide P?

Wait, in the integer division, P // x would truncate the decimal part, which would not correspond to the modular division.

But in the problem, since we're dealing with product of integers and removing elements that may or may not divide the product, this approach might fail in such cases.

Let me construct a test case where x does not divide P.

Consider n=2, m=5, arr=[2,3], s="LL"

Step 1: product=2*3=6, 6 % 5=1, output 1

Remove 'L': remove 2, arr=[3]

Step 2: product=3, 3 % 5=3, output 3

In the code:

res=[0,0]

ans=2*3=6

res[0]=6 % 5 % MOD=1

c=1, l=0, r=1

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='L', ans=6 // 2 % MOD=3 % MOD=3

res[1]=3 % 5 % MOD=3

So, res=[1,3], which matches.

But in this case, 2 does not divide 6 evenly in modular arithmetic because 6 / 2 = 3, which is an integer, but in modular arithmetic, division is defined differently.

Wait, but 2 and 5 are coprime, so 2 has an inverse modulo 5, which is 3, because 2*3=6 ≡1 mod 5.

So, in modular arithmetic, 6 / 2 ≡ 6 * 3 ≡ 18 ≡ 3 mod 5, which matches the integer division result of 3.

So, in this case, integer division coincides with modular division.

Another test case:

n=2, m=4, arr=[2,3], s="LL"

Step 1: product=2*3=6, 6 % 4=2, output 2

Remove 'L': remove 2, arr=[3]

Step 2: product=3, 3 % 4=3, output 3

In the code:

res=[0,0]

ans=2*3=6

res[0]=6 % 4 % MOD=2

c=1, l=0, r=1

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='L', ans=6 // 2 % MOD=3 % MOD=3

res[1]=3 % 4 % MOD=3

So, res=[2,3], which matches.

But in this case, m=4, and 2 is not invertible modulo 4 because gcd(2,4)=2 ≠1.

Yet, the integer division approach still seems to give the correct result.

How is this possible?

Let me see:

In the first step, product=6, 6 % 4=2, output 2

Remove 'L': remove 2, arr=[3]

Product of remaining array=3, 3 % 4=3, output 3

In the code, ans=6 // 2=3, then 3 % 4=3, which matches.

But according to modular arithmetic, division by 2 modulo 4 is not defined because 2 and 4 are not coprime.

However, in this specific case, integer division happened to give the correct result.

This suggests that perhaps using integer division works in this problem, at least for the given constraints.

But is this a general approach?

Let me think of a case where it might fail.

Consider n=2, m=4, arr=[1,3], s="LL"

Step 1: product=1*3=3, 3 % 4=3, output 3

Remove 'L': remove 1, arr=[3]

Step 2: product=3, 3 % 4=3, output 3

In the code:

res=[0,0]

ans=1*3=3

res[0]=3 % 4 % MOD=3

c=1, l=0, r=1

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='L', ans=3 // 1 % MOD=3 % MOD=3

res[1]=3 % 4 % MOD=3

So, res=[3,3], which matches.

Another test case:

n=3, m=6, arr=[1,2,3], s="LRR"

Step 1: product=1*2*3=6, 6 % 6=0, output 0

Remove 'L': remove 1, arr=[2,3]

Step 2: product=2*3=6, 6 % 6=0, output 0

Remove 'R': remove 3, arr=[2]

Step 3: product=2, 2 % 6=2, output 2

So, expected output:0 0 2

In the code:

res=[0,0,0]

ans=1*2*3=6

res[0]=6 % 6 % MOD=0

c=1, l=0, r=2

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='L', ans=6 // 1 % MOD=6 % MOD=6

res[1]=6 % 6 % MOD=0

l=1

Second iteration (k=1):

s[1]='R', ans=6 // 3 % MOD=2 % MOD=2

res[2]=2 % 6 % MOD=2

r=1

So, res=[0,0,2], which matches.

Another test case:

n=3, m=4, arr=[2,2,2], s="LRL"

Step 1: product=2*2*2=8, 8 % 4=0, output 0

Remove 'L': remove 2, arr=[2,2]

Step 2: product=2*2=4, 4 % 4=0, output 0

Remove 'R': remove 2, arr=[2]

Step 3: product=2, 2 % 4=2, output 2

So, expected output:0 0 2

In the code:

res=[0,0,0]

ans=2*2*2=8

res[0]=8 % 4 % MOD=0

c=1, l=0, r=2

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='L', ans=8 // 2 % MOD=4 % MOD=4

res[1]=4 % 4 % MOD=0

l=1

Second iteration (k=1):

s[1]='L', ans=4 // 2 % MOD=2 % MOD=2

res[2]=2 % 4 % MOD=2

l=2

So, res=[0,0,2], which matches.

Wait, but in the second step, arr=[2,2], product=4, 4 % 4=0, but the code outputs 0 for the second step, which matches.

Another test case:

n=3, m=5, arr=[2,3,4], s="LRL"

Step 1: product=2*3*4=24, 24 % 5=4, output 4

Remove 'L': remove 2, arr=[3,4]

Step 2: product=3*4=12, 12 % 5=2, output 2

Remove 'R': remove 4, arr=[3]

Step 3: product=3, 3 % 5=3, output 3

So, expected output:4 2 3

In the code:

res=[0,0,0]

ans=2*3*4=24

res[0]=24 % 5 % MOD=4

c=1, l=0, r=2

First iteration (k=0):

s[0]='L', ans=24 // 2 % MOD=12 % MOD=12

res[1]=12 % 5 % MOD=2

l=1

Second iteration (k=1):

s[1]='R', ans=12 // 4 % MOD=3 % MOD=3

res[2]=3 % 5 % MOD=3

r=1

So, res=[4,2,3], which matches.

Given that in all these test cases, the code produces the correct output using integer division, it seems that this approach works, at least for the cases I've tested.

But I still need to understand why this is the case, especially when elements may not be invertible modulo m.

Let me think about the mathematical justification.

Suppose we have the product P of all elements in the array, and we remove an element x.

If x divides P, then P // x is an
