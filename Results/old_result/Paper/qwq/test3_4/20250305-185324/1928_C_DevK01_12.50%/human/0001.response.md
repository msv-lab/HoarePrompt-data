Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and settling into positions based on a parameter k, where k > 1. The settling pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions. The pattern is that the first k positions are numbered 1 to k, and the next k-2 positions are numbered k-1 down to 2. Then this repeats.

For example, for k=3:

Position numbers: 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,...

So, positions 1 to 3: 1,2,3

Positions 4 to 6: 2,1,2

Positions 7 to 9: 3,2,1

Positions 10 to 12: 2,3,2

And so on.

Given Vasya's position n and the number x he received, I need to find how many natural numbers k > 1 satisfy this condition.

First, I need to understand the pattern of the settling.

Let's see:

For a given k, the pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions.

In each cycle of 2k - 2 positions:

- The first k positions: 1 to k

- The next k-2 positions: k-1 down to 2

So, for k=3:

Cycle length: 2*3 - 2 = 4

Pattern: 1,2,3,2

Then it repeats: 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,...

For k=4:

Cycle length: 6

Pattern: 1,2,3,4,3,2

And repeats: 1,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,3,2,...

Given n and x, I need to find all k >1 such that the number at position n is x.

Constraints:

- k is a natural number greater than 1.

- 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9

- t ≤ 100 test cases

First, I need to find a way to determine for a given n and x, what are the possible k's that satisfy the condition.

Let me try to find a formula or a pattern that can help me compute the value at position n for a given k.

Given k, let's find out what number is at position n.

First, find out which cycle n falls into.

Each cycle has length 2k - 2.

So, the cycle number is floor((n-1)/(2k-2)) +1

Wait, better to compute the position within the cycle.

Let’s compute the position p within the cycle:

p = n mod (2k - 2)

If p ==0, then p = 2k - 2

Now, within the cycle:

- If p ≤ k, then the number is p

- Else, the number is 2k - p

So, for k=3:

Cycle length=4

p = n mod 4

if p <=3, number =p

else, number=6-p

Wait, for p=4, number=6-4=2

So, positions 4,8,12,... get number 2

Positions 1,5,9,... get number1

Positions2,6,10,... get number2

Positions3,7,11,... get number3

Wait, but earlier example for k=3 was 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,...

Wait, seems inconsistent.

Wait, in the example for k=3 and n=10, x=2.

From the table:

k=2: 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2

k=3:1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2

k=5:1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2

k=6:1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2

So, for k=3, position 10 is 2.

Similarly, for k=5, position 10 is 2.

For k=6, position10 is 2.

For k=2, position10 is2.

So, in this case, k=2,3,5,6 are valid.

Need to find all k >1 such that the number at position n is x.

Let me try to generalize.

Given n and x, find all k >1 where the number at position n is x.

First, find the general formula for the number at position n for a given k.

Given k, the pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.

Within each cycle of 2k-2 positions:

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 to 2

So, for a given position n, find its position p within the cycle:

p = n mod (2k -2)

If p ==0, p =2k-2

Then:

if p <=k, number =p

else, number =2k -p

So, we have:

number = p if p <=k else 2k -p

We need number =x

So:

if p <=k and p==x, or p >k and 2k -p ==x

So:

if p <=k:

p ==x

else:

2k -p ==x ⇒ 2k =x +p ⇒ k=(x +p)/2

Since k must be integer, x +p must be even.

Also, p =n mod (2k -2)

But p depends on k, which we're trying to find.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider the cycle length c=2k -2

So, c=2k -2 ⇒ k=(c +2)/2

Since k must be integer, c must be even.

So, c is even.

Let’s set c=2m, where m >=1 (since k >1)

Then k=m +1

So, k ranges from 2 to infinity, m from1 to infinity.

Now, c=2m

Within each cycle of length 2m:

- Positions1 to m+1:1 to m+1

- Positions m+2 to 2m: m, m-1,...,2

Wait, check for k=3 (m=2):

Cycle length c=4

Positions1 to3:1,2,3

Positions4:2

Which matches.

For k=4 (m=3):

Cycle length c=6

Positions1 to4:1,2,3,4

Positions5:3

Positions6:2

And so on.

Given n and x, find all m >=1 such that at position n, the number is x.

Let’s find the number at position n for a given m.

Cycle length c=2m

Position within cycle p=n mod c

If p==0, p=c

Then:

if p <= m+1, number =p

else, number =2m -p +2

Wait, for k=3 (m=2), c=4

p=1: number=1

p=2: number=2

p=3: number=3

p=4: number=2

So, for m=2:

if p <=3, number=p

else, number=4 -p +2=6 -p

But 6 -4=2, which matches.

Wait, general formula:

if p <= m+1, number=p

else, number=2m -p +2

Wait, for m=2:

p=1:1

p=2:2

p=3:3

p=4:2m -p +2=4 -4 +2=2

Yes, matches.

Similarly, for m=3 (k=4):

p=1:1

p=2:2

p=3:3

p=4:4

p=5:2m -p +2=6 -5 +2=3

p=6:6 -6 +2=2

Which matches.

So, general formula:

number = p if p <= m+1 else 2m -p +2

We need number =x

So:

if p <= m+1:

p ==x

else:

2m -p +2 ==x ⇒ 2m =x +p -2 ⇒ m=(x +p -2)/2

Now, p =n mod (2m)

But m is expressed in terms of p and x.

This seems recursive.

Let me see if I can find a relationship between m and p.

Let’s consider two cases:

1. p <= m+1 ⇒ p ==x

2. p > m+1 ⇒ m=(x +p -2)/2

In the first case, p ==x and p <= m+1

So, m >= p -1 >= x -1

So, m >= x -1

In the second case, m=(x +p -2)/2

Also, p > m+1

So, p > m+1 ⇒ p > (x +p -2)/2 +1

Let’s solve this inequality:

p > (x +p -2)/2 +1

Multiply both sides by 2:

2p > x +p -2 +2

2p > x +p

Subtract p:

p > x

So, p > x

But in this case, p > m+1, and m=(x +p -2)/2

Also, m must be integer, so x +p -2 must be even.

Moreover, m >=1, so (x +p -2)/2 >=1 ⇒ x +p -2 >=2 ⇒ p >=4 -x

But x >=1, n >=2, so p >=1

Wait, need to be careful.

Let me summarize:

Case 1: p <= m+1

p ==x

And p <= m+1 ⇒ m >= p -1

Since m >=1, p -1 >=0 ⇒ p >=1

So, m >= max(1, x -1)

Case 2: p > m+1

m=(x +p -2)/2

And p > m+1 ⇒ p > (x +p -2)/2 +1

Which simplifies to p > x

So, p > x

Also, m=(x +p -2)/2 must be integer

So, x +p -2 must be even

Let’s consider p > x

Now, p =n mod (2m)

But m=(x +p -2)/2

This seems complicated.

Let’s try to express p in terms of m.

From p =n mod (2m)

If p > m+1, then m=(x +p -2)/2 ⇒ p=2m -x +2

Substitute into p =n mod (2m)

2m -x +2 ≡ n mod (2m)

Which implies:

2m -x +2 -n ≡0 mod (2m)

Or, 2m divides (n +x -2)

Wait, 2m divides (n +x -2)

Wait, 2m -x +2 ≡n mod (2m)

Wait, 2m divides (n - (2m -x +2)) ⇒ 2m divides (n -2m +x -2)

Which implies 2m divides (n +x -2 -2m)

But this must hold for integer m

This seems messy.

Let me try another approach.

Let’s consider that p =n mod (2m)

If p <= m+1, then p ==x

Else, m=(x +p -2)/2

But p =n mod (2m)

So, p =n -2m * floor(n/(2m))

Let me consider the first case: p <= m+1 and p ==x

So, p ==x and p =n mod (2m)

Thus, n ≡x mod (2m)

So, 2m divides (n -x)

Therefore, m divides (n -x)/2

Wait, m divides (n -x)/2

But m must be integer, so (n -x) must be even

Wait, no, m divides (n -x)/2, which implies that 2m divides (n -x)

Wait, no.

Wait, if 2m divides (n -x), then m divides (n -x)/2

Wait, 2m divides (n -x) ⇒ (n -x)/2m is integer ⇒ (n -x) is divisible by 2m

But m must divide (n -x)/2 only if 2m divides (n -x)

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let’s consider that 2m divides (n -x)

So, 2m | (n -x) ⇒ n -x ≡0 mod (2m) ⇒ n ≡x mod (2m)

So, m can be any divisor of (n -x)/2, provided that m >= x -1

Wait, in case1: m >= x -1

And m >=1

Similarly, in case2: m=(x +p -2)/2, with p >x and x +p -2 even

But p =n mod (2m), and p >x

This seems too convoluted.

Let me look back at the example.

In the first test case:

n=10, x=2

k=2,3,5,6 are valid

Which correspond to m=1,2,4,5

Wait, k=m +1

So, m=k -1

So, m=1 (k=2), m=2 (k=3), m=4 (k=5), m=5 (k=6)

I need to find all m >=1 such that the number at position n is x

In this case, for m=1,2,4,5, the number at position10 is2

Let me check for m=1:

Cycle length c=2m=2

Positions:1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2

Position10:2, which matches x=2

For m=2:

Cycle length4

Positions:1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2

Position10:2, matches x=2

For m=4:

Cycle length8

Positions:1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,...

Position10:2, matches x=2

For m=5:

Cycle length10

Positions:1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,...

Position10:2, matches x=2

So, these m's are valid.

Now, I need a general way to find all m >=1 such that the number at position n is x

Looking back, in the code provided, it seems to implement some logic involving a function func_1 and some mathematical operations.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Looking at the code:

- Read t, the number of test cases

- For each test case, read n and x

- Compute y = n + x

- If y is odd, output 0

- Else, compute q = (y - 2) // 2

- Then, call func_1(q, x)

- If n >= 3x -2, add the result of func_1((n -x)//2, x)

- Combine the results, remove duplicates, and output the count

Wait, this seems overly complicated, and I'm not sure about its correctness.

Let me think differently.

From earlier, I have:

Case1: p <= m+1 and p ==x

Which implies n ≡x mod (2m)

And m >=x -1

Case2: p > m+1 and m=(x +p -2)/2

With p >x and x +p -2 even

And p =n mod (2m)

This seems too tangled.

Perhaps I need to consider the general condition for the number at position n to be x.

From earlier, we have:

number = p if p <= m+1 else 2m -p +2

Set this equal to x.

So:

if p <= m+1:

p ==x

else:

2m -p +2 ==x ⇒ p ==2m -x +2

Also, p =n mod (2m)

So, in case1: n mod (2m) ==x

In case2: n mod (2m) ==2m -x +2

So, in both cases, n mod (2m) is either x or 2m -x +2

Therefore, for a given m, if n mod (2m) ==x or n mod (2m) ==2m -x +2, then the number at position n is x.

So, to find all m >=1 such that n mod (2m) ==x or n mod (2m) ==2m -x +2

Now, m must be such that m >=x -1 (from case1) or m=(x +p -2)/2 with p >x (from case2)

Wait, perhaps I can consider m >= ceil((x +1)/2)

But I need to ensure that m is integer and m >=1

Wait, perhaps better to consider m >= floor((x +1)/2)

But need to verify.

Alternatively, since m >=x -1 in case1, and m=(x +p -2)/2 with p >x in case2, and p <=2m, since p =n mod (2m)

Wait, p can be up to 2m

But p >m+1 in case2, so p <=2m

So, m+1 < p <=2m

Thus, m+1 < p <=2m

But p =n mod (2m), which can be from1 to2m

So, m must be such that m+1 < p <=2m, and p =n mod (2m)

Wait, this seems too involved.

Let me consider that for a given m, n mod (2m) equals either x or 2m -x +2

So, for each m, check if n mod (2m) is x or 2m -x +2

But m can be any integer >=1, provided that k=m +1 >1, so m >=1

Also, m must be such that 2m -x +2 is positive and makes sense in the context.

But checking for each m individually is not efficient, especially since n and x can be up to 1e9.

So, I need a smarter way to find all m >=1 where n mod (2m) is either x or 2m -x +2

Let’s consider the first condition: n mod (2m) ==x

This implies that n -x is divisible by 2m, i.e., 2m divides (n -x)

Similarly, the second condition: n mod (2m) ==2m -x +2

Which implies n ≡2m -x +2 mod (2m)

Which simplifies to n ≡-x +2 mod (2m)

But -x +2 ≡2m -x +2 mod (2m)

So, n +x -2 is divisible by 2m, i.e., 2m divides (n +x -2)

Therefore, for m to be a valid solution, either:

- 2m divides (n -x), or

- 2m divides (n +x -2)

Also, m must be >=1, and k=m +1 >1, so m >=1

Additionally, in case1: p <= m+1, which is p ==x <= m+1

So, m >=x -1

In case2: p > m+1, which is p ==2m -x +2 > m+1

Which simplifies to 2m -x +2 > m+1 ⇒ m > x -1

So, m >=x

Wait, m >x -1

But m must be integer, so m >= ceil(x)

But x is integer, so m >=x

Wait, but in the first case, m >=x -1

So, overall, m >=x -1

But m must be integer >=1

So, m >= max(1, x -1)

Now, to find all m >= max(1, x -1) such that either:

- 2m divides (n -x), or

- 2m divides (n +x -2)

Now, to find all m that satisfy this, I can find all m such that 2m is a divisor of either (n -x) or (n +x -2)

So, first, find all divisors of (n -x) and (n +x -2)

Then, for each divisor d, set 2m =d, so m=d/2

But d must be even, since 2m is even

Wait, 2m is even only if m is integer, which it is

Wait, m is integer >=1

So, 2m is even integer >=2

But, in the problem, c=2m must divide either (n -x) or (n +x -2)

So, for 2m to divide (n -x), m must be such that 2m divides (n -x)

Similarly, 2m divides (n +x -2)

So, to find all m >= max(1, x -1) such that 2m divides (n -x) or 2m divides (n +x -2)

Now, to find all m where 2m is a divisor of (n -x) or (n +x -2)

But m must be integer >=1

So, for each divisor d of (n -x) and (n +x -2), if d is even, set m=d/2, and check if m >= max(1, x -1)

Wait, but 2m must divide d, or d=2m

Wait, no, 2m divides d, meaning d is a multiple of 2m

Wait, I'm confusing myself.

Let me clarify.

If 2m divides (n -x), then 2m is a divisor of (n -x)

Similarly, 2m divides (n +x -2)

So, to find all m where 2m is a divisor of (n -x) or (n +x -2)

So, find all divisors of (n -x) and (n +x -2), then divide by2 to get m, provided that the divisor is even.

Wait, but 2m must divide (n -x) or (n +x -2), so 2m is a divisor of (n -x) or (n +x -2)

So, for each divisor d of (n -x), if d is even, set m=d/2, and check if m >= max(1, x -1)

Similarly, for each divisor d of (n +x -2), if d is even, set m=d/2, and check if m >= max(1, x -1)

Then, collect all such m's, remove duplicates, and count them.

This seems manageable.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case, given n and x:

a. Compute (n -x) and (n +x -2)

b. Find all positive divisors of (n -x) and (n +x -2)

c. For each divisor d of (n -x):

- If d is even, set m=d/2

- If m >= max(1, x -1), add m to a set

d. For each divisor d of (n +x -2):

- If d is even, set m=d/2

- If m >= max(1, x -1), add m to the set

e. Output the number of unique m's in the set

This should work, provided that we handle the cases where (n -x) or (n +x -2) are negative or zero.

But according to the constraints, n >x >=1, so n -x >=0, and n +x -2 >=0.

Wait, n >x >=1, so n -x >=0

n +x -2 >=2n -2 >=0 (since n >=2)

Wait, n >=2, x >=1, so n +x -2 >=0

So, both (n -x) and (n +x -2) are non-negative integers.

So, we can find their divisors.

Also, since n and x can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to find the divisors.

An efficient way to find all divisors of a number is to iterate from1 to sqrt(number), and add both divisors when divisible.

Given that n and x can be up to 1e9, and t <=100, this should be efficient enough.

Now, let's look at the provided code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking back at the provided code:

- Read t, loop over t test cases

- For each test case, read n and x

- Compute y =n +x

- If y is odd, output0

- Else, compute q=(y -2)//2

- Call func_1(q, x)

- If n >=3x -2, add func_1((n -x)//2, x)

- Combine results, remove duplicates, output count

This seems partially correct but not entirely clear.

First, checking if y is odd: y=n +x

If y is odd, then output0

This might correspond to some condition where no m satisfies the requirements.

But in my earlier analysis, I didn't see any condition that would immediately disqualify based on y being odd.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the parity.

Let’s consider y =n +x

If y is odd, then (y -2)//2 is not an integer, but in Python, // performs integer division.

Wait, y -2 is odd if y is odd, so (y -2)//2 would be floor division.

But perhaps there's a parity condition that makes m impossible in some cases.

Wait, perhaps in the case where y is odd, there are no solutions.

Let me check.

From earlier, we have two conditions:

- 2m divides (n -x)

- 2m divides (n +x -2)

Now, if y=n +x is odd, then n +x is odd.

But n -x could be even or odd.

Wait, n -x and n +x have the same parity as n and x.

If n and x are both odd or both even, n -x is even, n +x is even.

If one is odd and one is even, n -x and n +x are both odd.

Given that, if y=n +x is odd, then n -x is also odd.

So, in the first condition, 2m divides (n -x), but n -x is odd, so 2m cannot divide it unless m=0, which is invalid.

Similarly, n +x -2 is odd minus 2, which is odd.

So, 2m cannot divide an odd number.

Therefore, if y=n +x is odd, there are no solutions.

Hence, outputting0 in this case is correct.

Now, in the code, when y is even, it computes q=(y -2)//2

Then calls func_1(q, x)

And if n >=3x -2, adds func_1((n -x)//2, x)

Then combines the results, removes duplicates, and outputs the count.

Let me understand what func_1 does.

Looking at func_1(q, x):

- Initialize an empty list M

- Compute w=sqrt(q)

- If w is integer and w >=x -1, append w to M

- For i from1 to floor(w) -1:

- If q %i ==0:

- If i >=x -1, append i to M

- If q//i >=x -1, append q//i to M

So, it seems to collect divisors of q that are >=x -1

But in our earlier analysis, we need to find m such that m >=x -1 and m=d/2 for some divisor d of (n -x) or (n +x -2)

Wait, perhaps q represents (n -x)/2 or (n +x -2)/2

Wait, in the code, y=n +x

q=(y -2)//2=(n +x -2)//2

So, q=(n +x -2)//2

Then, func_1(q, x) finds m such that m divides q, i.e., 2m divides (n +x -2)

Similarly, if n >=3x -2, it calls func_1((n -x)//2, x)

So, (n -x)//2 corresponds to q'=(n -x)/2

Then, func_1(q', x) finds m such that m divides q', i.e., 2m divides (n -x)

So, overall, it seems to be finding m such that m divides either (n +x -2)/2 or (n -x)/2, and m >=x -1

But there are some issues here.

First, when y is even, q=(y -2)//2=(n +x -2)//2

Then, func_1(q, x) finds m such that m divides q, i.e., m divides (n +x -2)/2

But in our earlier analysis, we need 2m divides (n +x -2), which is equivalent to m divides (n +x -2)/2, provided that (n +x -2) is even.

But (n +x -2) is even because y=n +x is even, so y -2 is even, so q=(y -2)//2 is integer.

Similarly, for (n -x)/2, since n -x is even (because n and x have the same parity), (n -x)/2 is integer.

So, func_1(q, x) is collecting m such that m divides q=(n +x -2)/2

And m >=x -1

Similarly, func_1((n -x)//2, x) collects m such that m divides (n -x)/2 and m >=x -1

Then, it combines these m's, removes duplicates, and counts them.

But in the code, it adds func_1((n -x)//2, x) only if n >=3x -2

I need to verify why this condition is present.

In my earlier analysis, there was no such condition.

Perhaps the condition n >=3x -2 is to ensure that (n -x)/2 is positive.

Since n >=x +1 (as n >x), (n -x)/2 >=1/2, but since it's integer division, (n -x)//2 >=0

But in the code, it adds func_1((n -x)//2, x) only if n >=3x -2

This seems arbitrary.

Let me check with the first test case:

n=10, x=2

y=12, which is even

q=(12 -2)//2=5

func_1(5,2)

Then, n=10 >=3*2 -2=4, which is true, so add func_1((10 -2)//2=4,2)

So, it computes func_1(5,2) and func_1(4,2), combines results, removes duplicates, and counts.

Let’s see what func_1(5,2) and func_1(4,2) return.

First, func_1(5,2):

q=5, x=2

w=sqrt(5)=2.236, floor(w)=2

Check if w==w//1: 2.236 !=2, so skip

Then, for i in range(1,2):

i=1

q%1==0, so append1 if1 >=1, which it is

Also, q//1=5, which is >=1, so append5

So, M=[1,5]

Second, func_1(4,2):

q=4, x=2

w=sqrt(4)=2.0, which equals w//1=2.0, and2 >=1, so append2

Then, for i in range(1,2):

i=1

q%1==0, so append1 if1 >=1, which it is

Also, q//1=4, which is >=1, so append4

So, M=[2,1,4]

Combine both lists: [1,5,2,1,4], remove duplicates: [1,2,4,5], count=4, which matches the first test case output.

Similarly, for the second test case:

n=3, x=1

y=4, which is even

q=(4 -2)//2=1

func_1(1,1)

Then, n=3 >=3*1 -2=1, which is true, so add func_1((3 -1)//2=1,1)

func_1(1,1):

q=1, x=1

w=sqrt(1)=1.0, which equals w//1=1.0, and1 >=0, so append1

Then, for i in range(1,1):

No iteration, since range(1,1) is empty

So, M=[1]

Again, func_1(1,1) is [1]

Combine both lists: [1,1], remove duplicates: [1], count=1, which matches the second test case output.

Third test case:

n=76, x=4

y=80, which is even

q=(80 -2)//2=39

func_1(39,4)

Then, n=76 >=3*4 -2=10, which is true, so add func_1((76 -4)//2=36,4)

func_1(39,4):

q=39, x=4

w=sqrt(39)=6.24, floor(w)=6

w != w//1, so skip

for i in1 to5:

i=1

39%1==0, 1 >=3? 1 <3, so skip

i=2

39%2 !=0, skip

i=3

39%3==0,3 >=3, append3

39//3=13 >=3, append13

i=4

39%4 !=0, skip

i=5

39%5 !=0, skip

So, M=[3,13]

func_1(36,4):

q=36, x=4

w=sqrt(36)=6.0, which equals w//1=6.0, and6 >=3, append6

Then, for i in1 to5:

i=1

36%1==0,1 >=3? no, skip

i=2

36%2==0,2 >=3? no, skip

i=3

36%3==0,3 >=3, append3

36//3=12 >=3, append12

i=4

36%4==0,4 >=3, append4

36//4=9 >=3, append9

i=5

36%5 !=0, skip

So, M=[6,3,12,4,9]

Combine both lists: [3,13,6,3,12,4,9], remove duplicates: [3,13,6,12,4,9], count=6

But the third test case output is9, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, in the code, it's M += func_1(q, x), then if n >=3x -2, M += func_1((n -x)//2, x)

Then, M = list(set(M)), then print(len(M))

In my earlier calculation, for q=39, M=[3,13]

For q=36, M=[6,3,12,4,9]

Combined M=[3,13,6,3,12,4,9], remove duplicates: [3,13,6,12,4,9], count=6

But the output is9, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the code, func_1(q, x) collects m such that m divides q and m >=x -1

In this case, x=4, so m >=3

So, for q=39:

Divisors:1,3,13,39

m=3,13,39 (since1 <3, skip)

For q=36:

Divisors:1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36

m=3,4,6,9,12,18,36 (1 and2 <3, skip)

Combined:3,13,39,4,6,9,12,18,36, total9

Wait, earlier I missed that q=39 has divisors1,3,13,39, all m >=3 except1

And q=36 has divisors1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36, m >=3:3,4,6,9,12,18,36

Combined:3,13,39,4,6,9,12,18,36, total9, which matches the output.

So, the code seems to be correctly implementing the logic to find all m such that m divides either (n +x -2)/2 or (n -x)/2, and m >=x -1

Then, it removes duplicates and counts them.

Given that, and considering the example test cases, it seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of natural numbers \( k \) greater than 1 that satisfy the given conditions based on Vasya's position in the line and the number he received during the settling.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Settling Pattern**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - Within each cycle:
     - Positions 1 to \( k \) are numbered 1 to \( k \).
     - Positions \( k+1 \) to \( 2k-2 \) are numbered \( k-1 \) down to 2.

2. **Mapping Position to Number**:
   - For a given position \( n \) and number \( x \), we need to find all \( k \) such that the number at position \( n \) is \( x \).
   - We introduce \( m = k - 1 \), transforming the cycle length to \( 2m \).

3. **Conditions for Valid \( m \)**:
   - Two cases based on the position within the cycle:
     1. \( p \leq m + 1 \) and \( p = x \)
     2. \( p > m + 1 \) and \( m = \frac{x + p - 2}{2} \)
   - These translate to:
     - \( 2m \) divides \( n - x \)
     - \( 2m \) divides \( n + x - 2 \)

4. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Find all divisors of \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \).
   - For each divisor \( d \), set \( m = d / 2 \) and check if \( m \geq \max(1, x - 1) \).

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def find_valid_ks(n, x):
    if (n + x) % 2 != 0:
        return 0
    y = n + x
    q1 = (y - 2) // 2
    L1 = func_1(q1, x)
    if n >= 3 * x - 2:
        q2 = (n - x) // 2
        L1 += func_1(q2, x)
    L1 = list(set(L1))
    return len(L1)

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.isqrt(q)
    if w * w == q and w >= x - 1:
        M.append(w)
    for i in range(1, w):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M.append(i)
            counterpart = q // i
            if counterpart != i and counterpart >= x - 1:
                M.append(counterpart)
    return M

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        print(find_valid_ks(n, x))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Main Logic**:
   - If \( n + x \) is odd, no solution exists.
   - Compute \( q1 = \frac{n + x - 2}{2} \) and find divisors using `func_1`.
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), compute \( q2 = \frac{n - x}{2} \) and find divisors using `func_1`.
   - Combine results, remove duplicates, and count the number of valid \( m \) (hence \( k \)).

3. **Helper Function `func_1`**:
   - Finds divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

This approach ensures we efficiently find all valid \( k \) values by leveraging divisor calculations and parity checks.
