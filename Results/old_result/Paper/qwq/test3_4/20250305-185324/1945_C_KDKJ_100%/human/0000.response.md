Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n houses in a village, and the villagers want to build a big road that divides the village into left and right sides. Each resident has a preference: they want to live on either the left side (0) or the right side (1). The road can be built between any two houses, or before the first house or after the last house.

The goal is to place the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side. Satisfaction means that they get to live on the side they wanted. Additionally, the road should be as close as possible to the middle of the village, meaning we need to minimize the absolute difference between the number of houses on each side and the center.

The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a number n and a string of 0s and 1s representing the residents' preferences. The output should be the position after which the road is built, with 0 meaning before the first house.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's consider an example.

Suppose n = 3 and the string is "101". If we place the road after the first house:

- Left side: house 1 ( preference 1 )

- Right side: houses 2 and 3 ( preferences 0 and 1 )

For the left side, there's only one house, and the resident wants to be on the right side (1), which matches the side they're on, so they're satisfied. That's at least half.

For the right side, there are two houses. We need at least ceil(2/2) = 1 satisfied resident. Among them, house 2 wants left (0) but is on the right, so not satisfied; house 3 wants right (1) and is on the right, so satisfied. So, one satisfied out of two, which meets the condition.

But according to the sample input, the answer is 2, meaning the road is built after the second house.

Let's check that:

- Left side: houses 1 and 2 ( preferences 1 and 0 )

- Right side: house 3 ( preference 1 )

For the left side, two houses: one wants right (1), one wants left (0). At least ceil(2/2) = 1 should be satisfied. Among them, house 1 is on the left but wants right, not satisfied; house 2 is on the left and wants left, satisfied. So, one satisfied, which is okay.

For the right side, one house: house 3 wants right and is on right, satisfied. At least ceil(1/2) = 1 satisfied, which is okay.

So both positions seem valid, but according to the problem, we need to choose the position that is as close as possible to the middle of the village, meaning minimizing |n/2 - i|, where i is the number of houses on the left side.

In this case, n=3, so n/2=1.5. Position 1: |1.5-1|=0.5; position 2: |1.5-2|=0.5. Both have the same distance, but the problem says if there are multiple positions with the same distance, choose the smaller i. So, position 1 (i=1) should be chosen, but the sample output is 2. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says: "among all suitable positions i, minimize |n/2 - i|." And "if there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum |n/2 - i|, output the smaller one."

In the first sample, n=3, positions 1 and 2 are both suitable, with |1.5-1|=0.5 and |1.5-2|=0.5. Both have the same distance, so we choose the smaller i, which is 1, but the sample output is 2. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the position.

Wait, position i means the road is built after house i. So, position 0: road before first house; all houses on the right.

Position n: road after last house; all houses on the left.

In the first sample, position 2 means the road is built after house 2, so houses 1 and 2 are on the left, house 3 is on the right.

But according to the sample output, it's 2, not 1. Maybe my earlier calculation was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of satisfied residents correctly.

Let me re-examine.

For position 1:

- Left side: house 1 ( wants 1, which matches the right side, but actually it's on the left, so not satisfied )

Wait, I think I messed up here. If the road is after house 1, then:

- Left side: house 1 ( wants 1, but is on left, which is not what they want, so not satisfied )

- Right side: houses 2 and 3 ( house 2 wants 0, which is left, but is on right, not satisfied; house 3 wants 1, which matches right, satisfied )

So, left side: 0 satisfied out of 1, which is less than ceil(1/2)=1, so not acceptable.

Wait, the sample input is 3 and "101", and output is 2.

So, position 2:

- Left side: houses 1 and 2 ( wants 1 and 0 respectively )

- Right side: house 3 ( wants 1 )

Left side: house 1 wants 1 but is on left (not satisfied); house 2 wants 0 and is on left (satisfied). So, 1 satisfied out of 2, which is ceil(2/2)=1, so okay.

Right side: house 3 wants 1 and is on right (satisfied). 1 satisfied out of 1, which is ceil(1/2)=1, so okay.

Hence, position 2 is acceptable.

Position 3:

- Left side: houses 1,2,3 ( wants 1,0,1 )

- Right side: no houses.

In this case, for the left side: three houses, need at least ceil(3/2)=2 satisfied.

Among them: house 1 wants 1 but is on left (not satisfied); house 2 wants 0 and is on left (satisfied); house 3 wants 1 but is on left (not satisfied). So, only 1 satisfied out of 3, which is less than 2, so not acceptable.

Position 0:

- Left side: no houses.

- Right side: houses 1,2,3 ( wants 1,0,1 )

For left side: no houses, which is fine (since 0 >= ceil(0/2)=0).

For right side: three houses, need at least ceil(3/2)=2 satisfied.

Houses: house 1 wants 1 and is on right (satisfied); house 2 wants 0 and is on right (not satisfied); house 3 wants 1 and is on right (satisfied). So, two satisfied out of three, which is okay.

So, position 0 is also acceptable, but according to the sample, position 2 is better because it's closer to the middle.

For n=3, position 2 has |1.5-2|=0.5, and position 0 has |1.5-0|=1.5, so position 2 is closer to the middle.

Hence, position 2 is the correct choice.

Okay, now I understand the problem better.

So, to solve this, I need to iterate through all possible positions (i from 0 to n), calculate the number of satisfied residents on both sides, check if they meet the condition, and among all positions that satisfy the condition, choose the one with the smallest |n/2 - i|, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

First, I need an efficient way to calculate the number of satisfied residents on each side for any given position i.

Let's think about prefix sums. I can precompute prefix sums of the number of residents who want left (0) and right (1) on the entire street.

Let's define:

- prefix_left[i]: number of residents who want left (0) among the first i houses.

- prefix_right[i]: number of residents who want right (1) among the first i houses.

Then, for a given position i (road after house i):

- Left side: houses 1 to i.

- Number of satisfied on left side: prefix_left[i] (since they want left and are on left).

- Number of residents on left side: i.

- Condition: prefix_left[i] >= ceil(i / 2).

- Right side: houses i+1 to n.

- Number of satisfied on right side: prefix_right[n] - prefix_right[i].

- Number of residents on right side: n - i.

- Condition: prefix_right[n] - prefix_right[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2).

Also, handle the cases when i=0 or i=n.

- i=0: left side has 0 houses, right side has n houses.

- i=n: left side has n houses, right side has 0 houses.

I need to make sure that for side with 0 houses, the condition is trivially satisfied (since 0 >= ceil(0/2)=0).

So, I can precompute prefix_left and prefix_right.

Wait, actually, in the code, it's easier to compute one prefix sum array.

Let's compute prefix_sum where prefix_sum[i] is the cumulative sum of a_j up to j=i.

Then:

- Number of residents who want right (1) up to house i: prefix_sum[i]

- Number of residents who want left (0) up to house i: i - prefix_sum[i]

Then, for a given position i:

- Left side: houses 1 to i.

- Satisfied on left side: number of residents who want left: i - prefix_sum[i]

- Condition: i - prefix_sum[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

- Right side: houses i+1 to n.

- Number of residents who want right: prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[i]

- Condition: prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

I need to find the position i that satisfies both conditions and minimizes |n/2 - i|, and among such positions, choose the smallest i.

To make it efficient, since n can be up to 3e5 and t up to 2e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 3e5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

So, in each test case, I can compute the prefix_sum array in O(n), then iterate through all possible i from 0 to n and check the conditions.

But since t can be up to 2e4, and n up to 3e5, but the total sum of n is up to 3e5, it should be acceptable.

Now, to handle ceil(x / 2), I can use (x + 1) // 2 in integer arithmetic.

So, for left side: i - prefix_sum[i] >= (i + 1) // 2

For right side: prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[i] >= (n - i + 1) // 2

I need to find i where both conditions are true, and among such i, find the one with the smallest |n/2 - i|, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

To minimize |n/2 - i|, I can iterate through all valid i and keep track of the i with the smallest distance to n/2.

Since n can be up to 3e5, and t up to 2e4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 3e5, it should be efficient enough.

Let me think about edge cases.

- All residents want left: "0" * n

- All residents want right: "1" * n

- n is odd or even

- Multiple valid positions with the same distance to n/2

- Only one valid position

- No valid positions (but the problem says it's guaranteed to have at least one)

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "it is guaranteed that the answer always exists", so I don't need to handle the case where no position satisfies the conditions.

Let me look at the sample input and output to verify.

Sample Input:

7

3

101

6

010111

6

011001

3

000

3

110

3

001

4

1100

Sample Output:

2

3

2

3

0

1

0

Let's verify the first one:

n=3, a="101"

Compute prefix_sum:

prefix_sum[0] = 0

prefix_sum[1] = 1

prefix_sum[2] = 1 + 0 = 1

prefix_sum[3] = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

Now, check for i=0:

Left: 0 houses, which is okay.

Right: n=3, prefix_sum[3]-prefix_sum[0]=2, need >= ceil(3/2)=2, which is okay.

So, position 0 is valid.

i=1:

Left: i=1, prefix_sum[1]=1, satisfied = 1 - 1 = 0 >= ceil(1/2)=1? No, 0 < 1, so not valid.

i=2:

Left: i=2, prefix_sum[2]=1, satisfied = 2 - 1 = 1 >= ceil(2/2)=1, okay.

Right: n=3, prefix_sum[3]-prefix_sum[2]=2-1=1 >= ceil(1/2)=1, okay.

i=3:

Left: i=3, prefix_sum[3]=2, satisfied = 3 - 2 = 1 >= ceil(3/2)=2, no.

So, valid positions are i=0 and i=2.

n/2 = 1.5

|1.5 - 0| = 1.5

|1.5 - 2| = 0.5

So, position 2 is closer to the middle, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case:

n=3, a="000"

prefix_sum[0]=0

prefix_sum[1]=0

prefix_sum[2]=0

prefix_sum[3]=0

i=0:

Left: 0 >= ceil(0/2)=0, okay.

Right: prefix_sum[3]-prefix_sum[0]=0 >= ceil(3/2)=2, no.

i=1:

Left: 1 - 0 =1 >= ceil(1/2)=1, okay.

Right: 0 - 0 =0 >= ceil(2/2)=1, no.

i=2:

Left: 2 - 0=2 >= ceil(2/2)=1, okay.

Right: 0 - 0=0 >= ceil(1/2)=1, no.

i=3:

Left: 3 - 0=3 >= ceil(3/2)=2, okay.

Right: 0 - 0=0 >= ceil(0/2)=0, okay.

So, position 3 is valid.

n/2=1.5

|1.5 - 3|=1.5

But according to the sample input, n=3, a="000", output=3, which matches.

Another test case:

n=3, a="110"

prefix_sum[0]=0

prefix_sum[1]=1

prefix_sum[2]=1+1=2

prefix_sum[3]=2+0=2

i=0:

Left: 0 >=0, okay.

Right: 2 >= ceil(3/2)=2, okay.

i=1:

Left:1 -1=0 >=1, no.

i=2:

2 -2=0 >=1, no.

i=3:

3 -2=1 >=2, no.

So, only position 0 is valid.

n/2=1.5

|1.5 -0|=1.5

Which matches the sample output of 0.

Another test case:

n=3, a="001"

prefix_sum[0]=0

prefix_sum[1]=0

prefix_sum[2]=0+0=0

prefix_sum[3]=0+0+1=1

i=0:

0 >=0, okay.

1 >=2, no.

i=1:

1 -0=1 >=1, okay.

1 -0=1 >=1, okay.

i=2:

2 -0=2 >=1, okay.

1 -0=1 >=1, okay.

i=3:

3 -1=2 >=2, okay.

1 -1=0 >=0, okay.

So, positions 1,2,3 are valid.

n/2=1.5

|1.5-1|=0.5

|1.5-2|=0.5

|1.5-3|=1.5

So, positions 1 and 2 are closest.

We need to choose the smallest i, which is 1, matching the sample output.

Another test case:

n=4, a="1100"

prefix_sum[0]=0

prefix_sum[1]=1

prefix_sum[2]=1+1=2

prefix_sum[3]=2+0=2

prefix_sum[4]=2+0=2

i=0:

0 >=0, okay.

2 >=2, okay.

i=1:

1 -1=0 >=1, no.

i=2:

2 -2=0 >=1, no.

i=3:

3 -2=1 >=2, no.

i=4:

4 -2=2 >=2, okay.

2 -2=0 >=0, okay.

So, positions 0 and 4 are valid.

n/2=2

|2-0|=2

|2-4|=2

So, both are equally distant, choose the smaller i, which is 0, matching the sample output.

Okay, now I need to implement this efficiently.

Plan:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n and the string a.

- Compute prefix_sum array, where prefix_sum[i] is the number of '1's in the first i houses.

- Initialize a variable to store the best position, initialized to -1.

- Initialize a variable to store the minimum distance to n/2, initialized to a large number.

- Iterate through i from 0 to n:

- Calculate the number of satisfied residents on the left and right sides.

- Check if both sides satisfy their conditions.

- If they do, calculate the distance |n/2 - i|.

- If this distance is smaller than the current minimum, update the best position and the minimum distance.

- If this distance is equal to the current minimum, choose the smaller i.

- After iterating through all i, output the best position.

Edge Cases to Consider:

- All residents want left: "0" * n

- All residents want right: "1" * n

- n is odd or even

- Multiple valid positions with the same distance to n/2

- Only one valid position

- No valid positions (but the problem guarantees at least one)

Implementing prefix_sum:

- Initialize prefix_sum[0] = 0

- For i from 1 to n:

- prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + a[i-1]

Implementing the conditions:

- For left side:

- If i > 0:

- satisfied_left = i - prefix_sum[i]

- needed_left = (i + 1) // 2

- Check if satisfied_left >= needed_left

- Else (i=0):

- left side has 0 houses, which is okay.

- For right side:

- If i < n:

- satisfied_right = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[i]

- needed_right = (n - i + 1) // 2

- Check if satisfied_right >= needed_right

- Else (i=n):

- right side has 0 houses, which is okay.

Implementing the distance calculation:

- Calculate distance = abs(n / 2 - i)

- Keep track of the minimum distance and the corresponding i.

- If multiple positions have the same distance, choose the smallest i.

Implementing this in code:

- Read t

- For each test case:

- Read n and a

- Compute prefix_sum

- Initialize best_i to -1 and min_distance to a large number (e.g., float('inf'))

- For i from 0 to n:

- Check conditions for left and right sides

- If both conditions are satisfied:

- Calculate distance = abs(n / 2 - i)

- If distance < min_distance:

- Update best_i to i

- Update min_distance to distance

- Else if distance == min_distance:

- Update best_i to the smaller i

- Print best_i

Optimizations:

- Since n can be up to 3e5 and t up to 2e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 3e5, the per-test-case time complexity should be O(n).

- Use fast input methods to handle large inputs within time constraints.

Potential Error-Prone Parts:

- Handling i=0 and i=n correctly.

- Correctly computing the number of satisfied residents on each side.

- Dealing with integer division and ceiling correctly.

- Ensuring that the distance calculation is accurate.

- Handling multiple test cases efficiently.

To ensure correctness, I can write test cases based on the examples and edge cases I considered.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it matches this logic.

Given Program:

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_2 simply calls func_1 for each test case.

func_1 implements the logic to solve the problem.

Let's analyze func_1.

func_1:

n = int(input())

a = input()

S = [[0, 0]]

for s in a:

(x, y) = S[-1]

if s == '0':

x += 1

else:

y += 1

S.append([x, y])

ans = -1

for i in range(n + 1):

left = S[i][0]

lsum = i

right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]

rsum = n - i

if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:

continue

elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):

ans = i

print(ans)

Explanation:

- It reads n and the string a.

- It initializes S as a list of lists, starting with [0, 0].

- It iterates through each character in a, building a prefix sum array S where S[i] contains the count of '0's and '1's up to the i-th house.

- Then, it iterates through possible positions i from 0 to n.

- For each i:

- left: number of '0's up to i

- lsum: number of houses on the left side, which is i

- right: total '1's minus '1's up to i, which is the number of '1's on the right side

- rsum: number of houses on the right side, which is n - i

- It checks if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum. If either is true, it skips this position.

- Else, if the distance |n/2 - i| is smaller than the distance for the current ans, it updates ans to i.

- Finally, it prints ans.

Comparison with my planned solution:

- My plan was to compute prefix_sum of '1's and then calculate satisfied residents based on that.

- In the given code, S[i][0] is the count of '0's up to i, and S[i][1] is the count of '1's up to i.

- The condition checked is left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum, which is equivalent to left < ceil(lsum / 2) or right < ceil(rsum / 2), since ceil(x / 2) is equal to (x + 1) // 2, and left < ceil(lsum / 2) is equivalent to left * 2 < lsum.

- So, the condition is correctly implemented.

- The distance calculation is abs(n / 2 - i), which matches my plan.

- It chooses the i with the smallest distance, and if there are multiple, it chooses the smallest i, as it iterates from i=0 to i=n and updates ans when a smaller distance is found.

- Hence, the given program seems correct.

Potential issues to check:

- Handling i=0 and i=n correctly.

- Ensuring that for sides with 0 houses, the condition is trivially satisfied.

- Correct calculation of satisfied residents.

- Correct computation of ceil(x / 2) using left * 2 < lsum.

- Correctly computing the distance and comparing it.

Given that the program matches my planned solution and handles all edge cases correctly, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
