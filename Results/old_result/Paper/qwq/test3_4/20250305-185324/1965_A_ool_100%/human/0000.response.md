Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with piles of stones. The rules are a bit unusual compared to standard stone removal games. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the game setup: There are n piles of stones, and each pile has a certain number of stones, given by a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Alice and Bob take turns, and on each turn, a player chooses a positive integer k, which has to be at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile, and then removes k stones from each nonempty pile. The player who can't make a move because all piles are empty loses.

So, the key here is that stones are removed from all nonempty piles simultaneously by k stones each time. This is different from games where stones are removed from a single pile.

Given that both players play optimally, we need to determine who wins, starting with Alice.

Let's look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

Example Input:

Output:

Alice

Bob

Alice

Alice

Bob

Alice

Alice

In the first test case, there are 5 piles, each with 3 stones. Alice can choose k=3, remove 3 stones from each pile, making all piles empty in one move, so she wins.

In the second test case, piles are 1 and 7. Alice must choose k=1 (since the smallest pile has 1 stone), removing 1 stone from both piles, resulting in piles of 0 and 6. Now, Bob can choose k=6, remove 6 stones from the pile of 6, making both piles empty, so Bob wins.

From these examples, it seems that the game depends on the minimum pile size and how the piles reduce over time.

Let me think about the general strategy.

First, since k has to be at most the smallest nonempty pile, the choice of k is limited by the smallest pile's size.

Each time a player chooses k and removes k stones from each nonempty pile, it's equivalent to reducing the size of each pile by k, but only if the pile had at least k stones.

Wait, no. Since k is at most the smallest nonempty pile, when we remove k stones from each nonempty pile, some piles might become empty if their size was exactly k.

So, after each move, piles that had exactly k stones become empty, and others have k stones removed.

The game continues until all piles are empty.

This seems similar to the concept of "Nimbers" or "Nim game" but with a different removal rule.

Let me consider the concept of "mex" (minimum excludant), which is used in impartial games to determine the next move.

But perhaps there's a simpler way to look at this.

Let's consider the sequence of moves.

Suppose we have piles with sizes a1, a2, ..., an.

Player chooses k (1 <= k <= min of the piles), removes k from each nonempty pile.

This operation is similar to subtracting k from each pile and then discarding the piles that become zero.

Wait, but it's not exactly subtracting k from each pile because piles that are exactly k become empty.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider the number of nonempty piles.

Initially, there are n nonempty piles.

After each move, the number of nonempty piles decreases by the number of piles that were exactly k.

So, if there are multiple piles of the same size, choosing k equal to that size will remove all such piles.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I should look for a pattern or a mathematical formula that can determine the winner based on the pile sizes.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to be trying to find such a pattern.

The function func_1 takes the array of pile sizes, finds the unique sizes, sorts them, and then checks if the smallest size is not 1. If it's not 1, it returns 'Alice', meaning Alice wins.

Otherwise, it checks if the sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1. If they do, it toggles a boolean A based on the differences between consecutive sizes, and finally returns 'Alice' if A is True, else 'Bob'.

This seems overly complicated and not clearly aligned with standard game theory approaches.

Let me try to think from game theory perspective.

This game is an impartial game, meaning that the set of moves available depends only on the position and not on which player's turn it is.

Impartial games can be analyzed using the concept of Nimbers, where each pile corresponds to a heap in Nim, and the game value is the XOR of all heap values.

However, in standard Nim, players choose one heap and remove any number of objects from it. Here, players choose k and remove k stones from all nonempty piles.

So, this is different from standard Nim.

Let me see if this game can be reduced to standard Nim or another known game.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a way to find the minimum excludant (mex) of some set related to the pile sizes.

Wait, maybe I should consider the number of possible moves.

Each move consists of choosing a k that is at most the smallest nonempty pile, and removing k stones from each nonempty pile.

The game ends when all piles are empty.

This seems similar to the game of Nim, but with a supermover that affects all piles simultaneously.

Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to the game of Green Hackenbush on a forest, but that might be too abstract for now.

Let me consider small examples to find a pattern.

Test case 1:

n = 5

piles = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Alice chooses k=3, removes 3 from each pile, all piles become empty. Alice wins.

Test case 2:

n = 2

piles = [1, 7]

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each pile: piles become [0,6]

Bob chooses k=6, removes 6 from the pile of 6: piles become [0,0]. Bob wins.

Test case 3:

n=7

piles=[1,3,9,7,4,2,100]

This seems more complex. Let's see.

Alice can choose k=1 (smallest pile is 1), removes 1 from each nonempty pile:

piles become [0,2,8,6,3,1,99]

Now, nonempty piles are [2,8,6,3,1,99]

Bob chooses k=1 again:

piles become [0,7,5,2,0,98]

Nonempty piles: [7,5,2,98]

Alice chooses k=2:

piles become [0,5,3,0,0,96]

Nonempty piles: [5,3,96]

Bob chooses k=3:

piles become [0,2,0,0,0,93]

Nonempty piles: [2,93]

Alice chooses k=2:

piles become [0,0,0,0,0,91]

Nonempty pile: [91]

Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,0,0,0,90]

Alice chooses k=90:

piles become [0,0,0,0,0,0]

Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the output, Alice wins this case.

But in my simulation, it seems Alice wins, which matches the output.

Another test case:

n=3

piles=[1,2,3]

Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [0,1,2]

Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,1]

Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,0]

Bob cannot move, so Alice wins.

But according to the output, Alice wins, which matches.

Another test case:

n=6

piles=[2,1,3,4,2,4]

Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [1,0,2,3,1,3]

Nonempty piles: [1,2,3,1,3]

Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [0,1,2,2,0,2]

Nonempty piles: [1,2,2,2]

Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,1,1,0,1]

Nonempty piles: [1,1,1]

Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,0,0,0,0]

Alice cannot move, so Bob wins.

Which matches the output 'Bob'.

From these examples, it seems that the player who faces a position where the smallest nonempty pile is 1 loses, unless the piles form a specific pattern.

Wait, no. In the second test case, Alice chose k=1 and was forced to leave nonempty piles, leading to Bob's win.

In the third test case, Alice also chose k=1, but was able to force a win by continuing to choose k=1 or other values.

This seems inconsistent.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the game can be modeled by considering the minimal excludant (mex) of the pile sizes.

In impartial game theory, the mex of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.

Alternatively, maybe the number of moves is important.

Each move reduces the pile sizes by k, and the game ends when all piles are empty.

If the total number of moves is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

But that seems too simplistic.

Wait, in the first test case, Alice made one move and won.

In the second test case, Alice made one move, then Bob made one move and won.

Total moves: 2, which is even, so Bob wins.

In the third test case, Alice made several moves, but in total, an odd number of moves were made, leading to Alice's win.

This seems to hold for the first few test cases.

Let me check the fourth test case:

n=3

piles=[1,2,3]

Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [0,1,2]

Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,1]

Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,0]

Total moves: 3, which is odd, Alice wins.

Fifth test case:

n=6

piles=[2,1,3,4,2,4]

Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [1,0,2,3,1,3]

Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,1,2,0,2]

Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,0,1,0,1]

Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,0,0,0,0]

Total moves: 4, which is even, Bob wins.

This seems to hold.

So, perhaps the total number of moves is determining the winner, with Alice winning if the number of moves is odd, Bob winning if even.

But I need to confirm this with the other test cases.

Sixth test case:

n=8

piles=[5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2]

Alice chooses k=2:

piles become [3,5,0,7,4,1,1,0]

Nonempty piles: [3,5,7,4,1,1]

Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [2,4,0,6,3,0,0,0]

Nonempty piles: [2,4,6,3]

Alice chooses k=2:

piles become [0,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]

Nonempty piles: [2,4,1]

Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0]

Nonempty piles: [1,3]

Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]

Bob chooses k=2:

piles become [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Total moves: 5, which is odd, Alice wins.

But according to the output, Alice wins, which matches.

Seventh test case:

n=1

piles=[1000000000]

Alice chooses k=1000000000:

piles become [0]

Bob cannot move, so Alice wins.

Which matches the output 'Alice'.

So, based on these observations, it seems that if the total number of moves is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

But I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Wait, but in the second test case, total moves are 2 (even), Bob wins, which matches.

In the third test case, total moves are 3 (odd), Alice wins.

In the fifth test case, total moves are 4 (even), Bob wins.

In the sixth test case, total moves are 5 (odd), Alice wins.

In the seventh test case, total moves are 1 (odd), Alice wins.

So, this seems to hold.

But I need to see if this is a general rule.

Let me think about how to calculate the total number of moves.

Each move reduces the size of each nonempty pile by k, where k is the chosen positive integer up to the smallest nonempty pile.

This is similar to the concept of "removing the top k layers" from all piles.

Alternatively, it's like performing a "parallel subtraction" from all piles.

This seems similar to the concept of "mex" in game theory, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to the maximum number of non-overlapping moves that can be made.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to the number of times we can select a k and remove it from all piles until all piles are empty.

This seems similar to the number of times we can subtract the minimum pile size from all piles.

But that's not exactly right, because k can be any value up to the current smallest pile size.

Wait, maybe it's equivalent to the number of distinct smallest pile sizes in the game.

Let me consider that.

In the first test case, all piles are 3, so only one distinct smallest pile size: 3. Total moves: 1 (odd), Alice wins.

Second test case: piles are 1 and 7.

- First move: k=1, piles become 0 and 6.

- Second move: k=6, piles become 0 and 0.

Total moves: 2 (even), Bob wins.

Third test case: piles are 1,3,9,7,4,2,100.

- First move: k=1, piles become 0,2,8,6,3,1,99.

- Second move: k=1, piles become 0,1,7,5,2,0,98.

- Third move: k=1, piles become 0,0,6,4,1,0,97.

- Fourth move: k=1, piles become [0,0,5,3,0,0,96].

- Fifth move: k=1, piles become [0,0,4,2,0,0,95].

- Sixth move: k=1, piles become [0,0,3,1,0,0,94].

- Seventh move: k=1, piles become [0,0,2,0,0,0,93].

- Eighth move: k=1, piles become [0,0,1,0,0,0,92].

- Ninth move: k=1, piles become [0,0,0,0,0,0,91].

- ... and so on, until the pile of 91 is reduced to 0.

This would take a lot of moves, but in the earlier simulation, it seemed to end in fewer moves. Maybe my simulation was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to count the number of moves.

Let me think about the minimal pile sizes at each step.

In the first move, k is chosen up to the smallest nonempty pile.

If we choose k equal to the smallest nonempty pile, then all piles that are equal to that k become empty, and others are reduced by k.

So, each move can be seen as removing a "layer" corresponding to the current smallest nonempty pile.

This seems similar to the concept of "height" in some games.

Perhaps the total number of distinct minimal pile sizes determines the number of moves.

Wait, let's consider that.

In the first test case, all piles are 3. The smallest is 3. Choose k=3, remove 3 from all, piles become empty. Total moves: 1.

In the second test case, piles are 1 and 7. Smallest is 1. Choose k=1, remove 1 from both, piles become 0 and 6. Now smallest is 6. Choose k=6, remove 6 from the pile of 6, piles become 0 and 0. Total moves: 2.

In the third test case, piles are 1,3,9,7,4,2,100.

- First move: k=1, remove 1 from all, piles become 0,2,8,6,3,1,99.

- Second move: k=1, remove 1 from nonempty piles, piles become 0,1,7,5,2,0,98.

- Third move: k=1, remove 1 from nonempty piles, piles become 0,0,6,4,1,0,97.

- Fourth move: k=1, remove 1 from nonempty piles, piles become 0,0,5,3,0,0,96.

- Fifth move: k=1, remove 1 from nonempty piles, piles become 0,0,4,2,0,0,95.

- Sixth move: k=1, remove 1 from nonempty piles, piles become 0,0,3,1,0,0,94.

- Seventh move: k=1, remove 1 from nonempty piles, piles become 0,0,2,0,0,0,93.

- Eighth move: k=1, remove 1 from nonempty piles, piles become 0,0,1,0,0,0,92.

- Ninth move: k=1, remove 1 from nonempty piles, piles become 0,0,0,0,0,0,91.

- ... and so on, until the last pile is reduced to 0.

This seems to suggest that the number of moves is equal to the number of distinct minimal pile sizes encountered during the game.

Wait, in the second test case, the distinct minimal pile sizes were 1 and 6, so two moves.

In the first test case, only one distinct minimal pile size: 3, so one move.

In the third test case, the minimal pile sizes were 1, then 1 again, then 1 again, etc., until finally 1.

Wait, but according to my earlier simulation, it seems like the minimal pile size is always 1, but that can't be right.

Wait, no. In the first move, k=1, piles become [0,2,8,6,3,1,99], smallest nonempty pile is 1.

In the second move, k=1, piles become [0,1,7,5,2,0,98], smallest nonempty pile is 1.

In the third move, k=1, piles become [0,0,6,4,1,0,97], smallest nonempty pile is 1.

In the fourth move, k=1, piles become [0,0,5,3,0,0,96], smallest nonempty pile is 3.

In the fifth move, k=1, piles become [0,0,4,2,0,0,95], smallest nonempty pile is 2.

In the sixth move, k=1, piles become [0,0,3,1,0,0,94], smallest nonempty pile is 1.

In the seventh move, k=1, piles become [0,0,2,0,0,0,93], smallest nonempty pile is 2.

In the eighth move, k=1, piles become [0,0,1,0,0,0,92], smallest nonempty pile is 1.

In the ninth move, k=1, piles become [0,0,0,0,0,0,91], smallest nonempty pile is 91.

Then, continue with k=1, reducing the last pile by 1 each time until it reaches 0.

So, the distinct minimal pile sizes were: 1, 3, 2, 91.

Wait, but in the moves above, the minimal pile sizes were 1, then 1, then 1, then 3, then 2, then 1, then 2, then 1, then 91.

So, the distinct values are 1, 3, 2, 91.

So, four distinct minimal pile sizes.

But in my earlier simulation, it took nine moves plus additional moves to reduce the last pile, but according to the output, Alice wins, which would correspond to an odd number of moves.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, maybe the number of moves is equal to the number of distinct minimal pile sizes.

In this case, distinct minimal pile sizes are 1, 2, 3, 91 – four distinct values, which is even, so Bob would win, but the output is 'Alice'.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times the minimal pile size changes.

In the first test case, minimal pile size is 3, then 0.

So, it changes once.

In the second test case, minimal pile size is 1, then 6, then 0.

So, it changes twice.

In the third test case, minimal pile size is 1, then 1, then 1, then 3, then 2, then 1, then 2, then 1, then 91, then down to 0.

So, it changes from 1 to 3 to 2 to 1 to 2 to 1 to 91.

That's seven changes.

Wait, but according to the output, Alice wins, which would correspond to an odd number of changes.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times the minimal pile size changes to a new value.

In the first test case, minimal pile size changes from 3 to 0.

One change.

In the second test case, from 1 to 6 to 0.

Two changes.

In the third test case, from 1 to 3 to 2 to 1 to 2 to 1 to 91 to 0.

That's seven changes.

So, for the third test case, number of changes is odd, Alice wins.

In the fourth test case, piles are [1,2,3].

- Choose k=1: piles become [0,1,2]

- Choose k=1: piles become [0,0,1]

- Choose k=1: piles become [0,0,0]

Changes: 1 to 1 to 1 to 0.

Wait, minimal pile sizes are 1, then 1, then 1, then 0.

So, only one distinct minimal pile size, 1, and then to 0.

So, one change.

Alice wins, which corresponds to an odd number of changes.

In the fifth test case, piles are [2,1,3,4,2,4].

- Choose k=1: piles become [1,0,2,3,1,3]

- Choose k=1: piles become [0,0,1,2,0,2]

- Choose k=1: piles become [0,0,0,1,0,1]

- Choose k=1: piles become [0,0,0,0,0,0]

Minimal pile sizes: 1, then 1, then 1, then 0.

So, one distinct minimal pile size, 1, and then to 0.

One change.

But according to the output, Bob wins.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the fifth test case, according to my earlier simulation, it should be:

- Initial: [2,1,3,4,2,4]

- Choose k=1: piles become [1,0,2,3,1,3]

- Choose k=1: piles become [0,0,1,2,0,2]

- Choose k=1: piles become [0,0,0,1,0,1]

- Choose k=1: piles become [0,0,0,0,0,0]

So, minimal pile sizes: 1, then 1, then 1, then 0.

Only one distinct minimal pile size, 1, and then to 0.

So, one change.

But according to the output, Bob wins.

This contradicts the earlier pattern.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let me redo the fifth test case.

n=6

piles=[2,1,3,4,2,4]

- Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [1,0,2,3,1,3]

Nonempty piles: [1,2,3,1,3]

- Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [0,1,2,2,0,2]

Nonempty piles: [1,2,2,2]

- Alice chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,1,1,0,1]

Nonempty piles: [1,1,1]

- Bob chooses k=1:

piles become [0,0,0,0,0,0]

Total moves: 4, which is even, so Bob wins.

According to the output, 'Bob', which matches.

But according to the earlier hypothesis, if the number of distinct minimal pile sizes is one (only 1), and changes to 0, it's one change, which is odd, so Alice wins.

But in this case, Bob wins.

So, the hypothesis is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's not about the number of distinct minimal pile sizes, but about something else.

Let me think differently.

Maybe it's about the maximum pile size.

But in the first test case, maximum pile size is 3, and Alice wins.

In the second test case, maximum pile size is 7, and Bob wins.

In the third test case, maximum pile size is 100, and Alice wins.

This doesn't seem consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the parity of the number of piles with odd sizes.

But in the first test case, all piles are odd (3 is odd), so five odd piles: odd number of odd piles.

In the second test case, piles are 1 (odd) and 7 (odd): two odd piles, even.

In the third test case, piles are 1(o),3(o),9(o),7(o),4(e),2(e),100(e): four odd piles, even.

But according to the output, Alice wins in the third test case.

This doesn't seem to align.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider the game in terms of "Nim heaps".

In standard Nim, the number of stones in each pile is independent, and the overall game is won if the XOR of all pile sizes is non-zero.

But in this game, moves affect all piles simultaneously.

So, it's not standard Nim.

Alternatively, perhaps it can be modeled as a single Nim heap.

Wait, but that seems unlikely because moves affect all piles.

Let me consider the game as equivalent to a single pile where the move reduces the pile by k, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's equivalent to the mex of the pile sizes.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the sequence of possible moves.

Each move corresponds to choosing a k that is at most the smallest pile, and then removing k from all piles.

This is similar to choosing a k and then reducing all piles by k.

This is similar to choosing a "layer" k and removing it from all piles.

This seems similar to the concept of "Nimbers" in game theory.

Alternatively, perhaps it's equivalent to the number of times we can choose such a k before all piles are empty.

But I need a way to compute who wins without simulating the entire game, which would be too slow for the given constraints.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Looking back at the provided code:

- It reads t test cases.

- For each test case, it reads n and then an array of n pile sizes.

- It calls func_1 on the array and prints the result.

In func_1:

- It initializes A to False.

- It creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes.

- If the smallest unique pile size is not 1, it returns 'Alice'.

- Otherwise, it checks if the unique pile sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

- If they do, it toggles A based on the number of unique pile sizes.

- Finally, it returns 'Alice' if A is True, else 'Bob'.

This seems overly complicated and not aligned with standard game theory approaches.

I need a better way to determine the winner.

Let me consider the game in terms of "mex".

At each step, the player chooses a k that is not equal to any of the current pile sizes, but that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the game can be modeled as a subtraction game, where the allowed moves are to subtract k from all piles, with k up to the smallest pile.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of "Nimbers" or "mex" of the exponents in the binary representation.

But that might be too complicated.

Let me consider the parity of the number of piles.

In the first test case, n=5 (odd), Alice wins.

Second test case, n=2 (even), Bob wins.

Third test case, n=7 (odd), Alice wins.

Fourth test case, n=3 (odd), Alice wins.

Fifth test case, n=6 (even), Bob wins.

Sixth test case, n=8 (even), Alice wins.

Seventh test case, n=1 (odd), Alice wins.

This doesn't hold, because in the sixth test case, n=8 (even), Alice wins.

So, parity of n doesn't determine the winner.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of distinct pile sizes.

In the first test case, one distinct pile size (3), Alice wins.

Second test case, two distinct pile sizes (1,7), Bob wins.

Third test case, seven distinct pile sizes (1,3,9,7,4,2,100), Alice wins.

Fourth test case, three distinct pile sizes (1,2,3), Alice wins.

Fifth test case, six distinct pile sizes (2,1,3,4,2,4) -> actually, unique sizes are 1,2,3,4, so four distinct, Bob wins.

Sixth test case, eight distinct pile sizes, Alice wins.

Wait, but in the sixth test case, piles are [5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2], which have unique sizes 2,3,5,6,7,9, so six distinct sizes, and Alice wins.

Seventh test case, one distinct pile size (1e9), Alice wins.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the minimal pile size is 1 or not.

In the provided code, it checks if the minimal pile size is not 1, then Alice wins.

Otherwise, it checks if the pile sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

If they do, it toggles A based on some condition.

But in the first test case, minimal pile size is 3 (not 1), Alice wins.

In the second test case, minimal pile size is 1, Bob wins.

In the third test case, minimal pile size is 1, Alice wins.

So, this doesn't hold consistently.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider the game ending when all piles are empty.

The last move empties all remaining piles.

So, the player who makes the last move wins.

This is a misère game.

Wait, but in standard Nim, the winner is the one who takes the last stone.

Here, it's similar: the one who makes the last move wins.

But the standard Nim game is a normal play game, where the last move wins.

In this case, it's similar.

So, perhaps it can be modeled as a Nim game.

But the moves are different.

Wait, perhaps I can find the Nimber (xor) of the pile sizes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the game can be decomposed into smaller games.

Let me think about the minimal pile size.

Each move, the player chooses k up to the minimal pile size and removes k from all piles.

This is similar to choosing a k and then reducing all piles by k.

This is similar to the concept of "Nim differences".

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to the number of times we can subtract the minimal pile size from all piles until all are zero.

But that seems too simplistic.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of distinct minimal pile sizes in the game.

In the first test case, only one distinct minimal pile size (3), Alice wins.

In the second test case, two distinct minimal pile sizes (1 and 6), Bob wins.

In the third test case, multiple distinct minimal pile sizes, Alice wins.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of times the minimal pile size changes during the game.

But that would be too slow to compute.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the game in terms of "mex".

At each step, the mex of the current pile sizes determines the possible moves.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the game can be modeled as a single Nim pile with a certain size.

But I need to find what that size would be.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of times we can choose k equal to the minimal pile size.

In the first test case, k=3, one move.

In the second test case, k=1, then k=6, two moves.

In the third test case, it's more complex, but seems to involve multiple moves.

But counting the number of moves is too slow for large n.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the sorted unique pile sizes.

In the provided code, it sorts the unique pile sizes and checks if they form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

If they do, it toggles A based on some condition.

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Let me think about what it means for the unique pile sizes to form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

For example, in the fourth test case, piles are [1,2,3], which is consecutive starting from 1.

According to the output, Alice wins.

In the fifth test case, piles are [1,2,3,4], which is consecutive starting from 1, but Bob wins.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, n=6, piles=[2,1,3,4,2,4], unique sizes are 1,2,3,4, which is consecutive starting from 1, and Bob wins.

In the third test case, piles=[1,3,9,7,4,2,100], unique sizes are [1,2,3,4,7,9,100], which is not consecutive, and Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the provided code, if the unique sizes are consecutive starting from 1, it toggles A based on the number of unique sizes.

In the fifth test case, unique sizes are consecutive from 1 to 4, so it should toggle A based on the number of unique sizes.

But according to the output, Bob wins.

This seems inconsistent.

I need to find a better approach.

Let me consider the minimal excludant (mex) of the pile sizes.

The mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the pile sizes.

In the first test case, pile sizes are all 3, so mex is 0, but that doesn't help.

In the second test case, piles are 1 and 7, mex is 0, but again, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps it's about the mex of the pile sizes minus k.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define the game state based on the current pile sizes.

If all piles are empty, the current player loses.

Otherwise, the current player can choose any k up to the smallest pile size, remove k from all piles, and pass the turn to the opponent.

I need to find a way to determine the winning player based on the initial pile sizes.

This seems similar to the concept of a "Nimber" or "grundy number" in game theory.

The grundy number for a game state is the mex of the grundy numbers of the positions reachable in one move.

In this game, choosing k corresponds to moving to a position where each pile has k less stones (if >=k), or is empty otherwise.

But computing the grundy number for each possible pile configuration would be too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the sorted unique pile sizes.

Suppose I sort the unique pile sizes in increasing order: s1 < s2 < ... < sm.

Each move corresponds to removing a prefix of length k from each si.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times we can choose a certain k.

Let me consider that the game can be represented by the number of distinct minimal pile sizes.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of times the minimal pile size changes during the game.

But that would be too slow to compute for large n.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider binary representations or something.

Wait, perhaps it's about the maximum pile size.

But in the first test case, maximum pile size is 3, Alice wins.

In the second test case, maximum pile size is 7, Bob wins.

In the third test case, maximum pile size is 100, Alice wins.

No clear pattern.

Wait, perhaps it's about the parity of the number of piles that have a pile size greater than the smallest pile.

But in the first test case, all piles are 3, so no piles have size greater than 3, which is zero, which is even, so Bob should win, but Alice wins.

This doesn't hold.

I'm getting stuck.

Let me look back at the provided code.

It takes the unique pile sizes, sorts them, and if the smallest is not 1, returns 'Alice'.

Otherwise, it checks if the unique pile sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

If they do, it toggles A based on the differences between consecutive sizes.

Finally, it returns 'Alice' if A is True, else 'Bob'.

This seems overly complicated and not aligned with standard game theory.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that if the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can choose k equal to the smallest pile size, remove it from all piles, and win immediately.

Hence, if the smallest pile size is greater than 1, Alice wins.

Otherwise, if the smallest pile size is 1, it's more complicated.

In the second test case, smallest pile size is 1, and Bob wins.

In the third test case, smallest pile size is 1, and Alice wins.

So, the outcome depends on more factors than just the smallest pile size.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the pile sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

If they do, then the number of moves is equal to the number of unique pile sizes.

If the number of unique pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

In the third test case, unique pile sizes are [1,2,3,4,7,9,100], which is not consecutive, so perhaps it's different.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, piles are [1,2,3], which is consecutive, and Alice wins.

In the fifth test case, piles are [1,2,3,4], which is consecutive, and Bob wins.

So, this doesn't hold.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the game as equivalent to a Nim game with a certain number of heaps.

If I can find the equivalent Nimber, I can determine the winner.

But I need to find what that Nimber is.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a way to group the piles into groups where each group corresponds to a certain grundy number.

But computing grundy numbers for large pile sizes is not feasible.

Wait, perhaps there is a mathematical formula based on the pile sizes.

Let me consider that the game ends when all piles are empty, and the last move wins.

This is a misère game.

But standard Nim is a normal play game.

Misère Nim has different rules.

But in this case, since each move affects all piles simultaneously, it's not straightforward.

I need to find a way to calculate the overall game value.

Let me consider that the game can be represented by the number of distinct pile sizes.

But that seems arbitrary.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of times the minimal pile size appears.

In the first test case, minimal pile size is 3, appears 5 times.

Alice chooses k=3, removes all piles in one move.

Alice wins.

In the second test case, minimal pile size is 1, appears once.

Alice chooses k=1, removes one stone from both piles, making one pile empty.

Now, Bob chooses k=6, removes six stones from the remaining pile, making it empty.

Bob wins.

In the third test case, minimal pile size is 1, appears once.

Alice chooses k=1, removes one stone from all piles, making some piles empty.

Bob then chooses k=1, and so on.

Eventually, Alice makes the last move.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of times the minimal pile size appears.

But in the first test case, minimal pile size appears 5 times.

In the second test case, once.

In the third test case, once.

In the fourth test case, once.

In the fifth test case, minimal pile size is 1, appears once.

In the sixth test case, minimal pile size is 2, appears twice.

In the seventh test case, minimal pile size is 1, appears once.

But this doesn't align with the winners.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the game can be modeled by the mex of the pile sizes minus k.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look for patterns in the pile sizes.

Let me consider the sorted unique pile sizes.

In the third test case, sorted unique pile sizes are [1,2,3,4,7,9,100]

In the fifth test case, [1,2,3,4]

In the fourth test case, [1,2,3]

In the second test case, [1,7]

In the first test case, [3]

In the sixth test case, [2,3,5,6,7,9]

In the seventh test case, [1000000000]

If I look at the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes:

- Third test case: 1,1,1,3,2,91

- Fifth test case: 1,1,1

- Fourth test case:1,1

- Second test case:6

- First test case: N/A, only one size

- Sixth test case:1,2,1,3,2,4

- Seventh test case: N/A, only one size

But I don't see a pattern here.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the minimal pile size is 1 or not.

If the minimal pile size is greater than 1, Alice can choose k equal
