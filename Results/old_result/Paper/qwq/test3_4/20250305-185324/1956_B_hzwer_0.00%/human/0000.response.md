Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears on exactly two cards. Me and Nene each get n cards initially. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating, with me going first. Each turn, the player picks a card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, they place the card on the table.

The problem is asking me, given my cards, what's the maximum number of points I can get if both Nene and I play optimally. Nene is smart and wants to maximize her points and minimize mine.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. There are 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing twice. Me and Nene each have n cards. We take n turns each, alternating, starting with me.

During each turn:

1. The player picks one card from their hand.

2. If the number on that card is already on the table, they get a point.

3. Then, they place the card on the table.

Importantly, all cards on the table are visible to both players at all times.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and, in case of ties, minimize my score.

My goal is to maximize my score, assuming Nene plays optimally against me.

Given that, I need to find the best possible score I can achieve.

Let's look at the example to understand better.

In the first test case:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

The sequence of moves is described, and it results in me getting 1 point and Nene getting 3.

It's claimed that I can't do better than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

I need to confirm if that's indeed the case and understand why.

Let me try to simulate the game.

Initial state:

- Table: empty

- My hand: 1,1,2,3

- Nene's hand: 2,3,4,4

First turn: Me

Options: play 1, 2, or 3.

- If I play 1:

- Table: 1

- No point for me since 1 wasn't on the table.

Second turn: Nene

- Nene plays optimally. She has 2,3,4,4.

- She wants to maximize her points and minimize mine.

- If she plays 4, table: 1,4

- If she plays 2 or 3, table: 1,2 or 1,3

Third turn: Me

- I have 1,2,3 (assuming I played 1 first)

- If Nene played 4, table: 1,4

- I can play 1,2,3

- If I play 1: table: 1,4,1 ; I get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table)

- If I play 2: table: 1,4,2 ; no point

- If I play 3: table: 1,4,3 ; no point

- To maximize my points, I choose to play 1 and get 1 point.

Fourth turn: Nene

- Nene has 3,4,4 (assuming she played 4 first)

- Table: 1,4,1

- She plays 4: table: 1,4,1,4 ; she gets 1 point (since 4 is already on the table)

Fifth turn: Me

- I have 2,3

- Table: 1,4,1,4

- Play 2: table: 1,4,1,4,2 ; no point

- Play 3: table: 1,4,1,4,3 ; no point

- I get 0 points here.

Sixth turn: Nene

- Nene has 3,4

- Table: 1,4,1,4,2

- Play 3: table: 1,4,1,4,2,3 ; no point

- Play 4: table: 1,4,1,4,2,4 ; she gets 1 point (since 4 is already on the table)

Seventh turn: Me

- I have 2,3

- Assuming I already played one, let's say 2 is left.

- Table: 1,4,1,4,2,3

- Play 2: table: 1,4,1,4,2,3,2 ; I get 1 point (since 2 is already on the table)

- Or play 3: table: 1,4,1,4,2,3,3 ; I get 1 point

- But in the initial simulation, it seems I only get 1 point, not 2.

Wait, in the example, it's said that I get 1 point and Nene gets 3.

In my simulation, if I play 1 first, then play 2 or 3 later, I might get 1 point if Nene plays in a certain way.

But perhaps there's a better strategy.

Let me try a different sequence.

First turn: Me

Play 2.

Table: 2

Second turn: Nene

Plays 3.

Table: 2,3

Third turn: Me

Play 1.

Table: 2,3,1

Fourth turn: Nene

Plays 4.

Table: 2,3,1,4

Fifth turn: Me

Play 1.

Table: 2,3,1,4,1

I get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table)

Sixth turn: Nene

Plays 4.

Table: 2,3,1,4,1,4

Nene gets 1 point (since 4 is already on the table)

Seventh turn: Me

Play 3.

Table: 2,3,1,4,1,4,3

No point.

Eighth turn: Nene

Play 2.

Table: 2,3,1,4,1,4,3,2

Nene gets 1 point (since 2 is already on the table)

Total: Me 1, Nene 3.

Same as the example.

Is there a way for me to get more than 1 point?

Let's try another sequence.

First turn: Me

Play 1.

Table: 1

Second turn: Nene

Plays 4.

Table: 1,4

Third turn: Me

Play 1.

Table: 1,4,1

I get 1 point.

Fourth turn: Nene

Plays 4.

Table: 1,4,1,4

Nene gets 1 point.

Fifth turn: Me

Play 2.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2

No point.

Sixth turn: Nene

Plays 3.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2,3

No point.

Seventh turn: Me

Play 3.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2,3,3

I get 1 point.

Eighth turn: Nene

Play 2.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2,3,3,2

Nene gets 1 point.

Total: Me 2, Nene 2.

Wait, in this sequence, I got 2 points, and Nene got 2 points.

But according to the example, I should only be able to get 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

So, perhaps Nene wouldn't allow me to get 2 points.

Wait, in this sequence, Nene played 4 and then 3, allowing me to get 2 points.

Maybe if Nene plays optimally, she would prevent me from getting 2 points.

Let me see.

In the third turn, when I have to play after Nene played 4, I play 1 and get 1 point.

Then Nene plays 4 and gets 1 point.

Then I play 2, no point.

Nene plays 3, no point.

I play 3, get 1 point.

Nene plays 2, get 1 point.

Total: Me 1, Nene 3.

But in the previous sequence, where I got 2 points, Nene played 4 and then 3.

Maybe if Nene plays 3 instead of 4 in her second turn, it changes things.

Let's try:

First turn: Me

Play 1.

Table: 1

Second turn: Nene

Plays 3.

Table: 1,3

Third turn: Me

Play 1.

Table: 1,3,1

I get 1 point.

Fourth turn: Nene

Plays 4.

Table: 1,3,1,4

Fifth turn: Me

Play 2.

Table: 1,3,1,4,2

No point.

Sixth turn: Nene

Plays 4.

Table: 1,3,1,4,2,4

Nene gets 1 point.

Seventh turn: Me

Play 3.

Table: 1,3,1,4,2,4,3

I get 1 point.

Eighth turn: Nene

Play 2.

Table: 1,3,1,4,2,4,3,2

Nene gets 1 point.

Total: Me 2, Nene 2.

So, again, I get 2 points.

But according to the example, I should only get 1 point.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps Nene can play in a way to prevent me from getting 2 points.

Let's see.

First turn: Me

Play 1.

Table: 1

Second turn: Nene

Plays 4.

Table: 1,4

Third turn: Me

Play 1.

Table: 1,4,1

I get 1 point.

Fourth turn: Nene

Plays 4.

Table: 1,4,1,4

Nene gets 1 point.

Fifth turn: Me

Play 2.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2

No point.

Sixth turn: Nene

Plays 3.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2,3

No point.

Seventh turn: Me

Play 3.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2,3,3

I get 1 point.

Eighth turn: Nene

Play 2.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2,3,3,2

Nene gets 1 point.

Total: Me 2, Nene 2.

Again, I get 2 points.

Wait, maybe in some sequences, I can only get 1 point.

Let's try another sequence.

First turn: Me

Play 2.

Table: 2

Second turn: Nene

Plays 3.

Table: 2,3

Third turn: Me

Play 1.

Table: 2,3,1

Fourth turn: Nene

Plays 4.

Table: 2,3,1,4

Fifth turn: Me

Play 1.

Table: 2,3,1,4,1

I get 1 point.

Sixth turn: Nene

Plays 4.

Table: 2,3,1,4,1,4

Nene gets 1 point.

Seventh turn: Me

Play 3.

Table: 2,3,1,4,1,4,3

I get 1 point.

Eighth turn: Nene

Play 2.

Table: 2,3,1,4,1,4,3,2

Nene gets 1 point.

Total: Me 1, Nene 3.

Wait, in this sequence, I get 1 point.

But in the previous ones, I got 2 points.

So perhaps, depending on how Nene plays, she can limit my points to 1.

But in some sequences, I can get 2 points.

But according to the example, the answer is 1, meaning I can't get more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

So, perhaps Nene can force me to get only 1 point.

How does she do that?

Let me think about Nene's optimal strategy.

Nene wants to maximize her points and, in case of a tie, minimize mine.

So, she will play in a way that not only maximizes her points but also, if multiple options give the same score for her, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

In the sequences above, when Nene has the choice between playing 4 or 3 in her second turn, playing 4 leads to me potentially getting 2 points, while playing 3 leads to me getting only 1 point.

So, if Nene plays 3 in her second turn, she can limit my points to 1.

Hence, in the first sequence, Nene plays 4, allowing me to get 2 points, but in the second sequence, she plays 3, limiting me to 1 point.

So, Nene can choose to play 3 instead of 4 to minimize my points.

Hence, in the optimal play, I can only get 1 point.

So, the answer is 1.

But in the problem, it's stated that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and, in case of ties, minimize mine.

In the first sequence, Nene gets 3 points, and in the second sequence, she also gets 3 points.

So, in both cases, her score is the same, but in one case, I get 2 points, and in the other, I get 1 point.

Therefore, in the case of a tie in her score, she chooses the play that minimizes my score, which is 1 point.

Hence, the answer is 1.

So, in the problem, I need to calculate the maximum points I can get assuming Nene plays optimally, which includes choosing plays that minimize my score in case of ties in her score.

Now, I need to generalize this to any n and any distribution of my cards.

I need to find a way to model this game and compute my maximum possible score.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t (number of test cases) is up to 10^4, but the total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

But the provided program seems to use DP, which might be acceptable, but I need to understand it.

First, let's understand the DP approach.

Looking at the code:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read a list of n integers, representing my cards.

- Initialize a DP table: dp[i][j], where i ranges from 0 to n-1 and j from 0 to n-1.

- dp[i][j] seems to represent the maximum points I can get starting from some state defined by i and j.

- The DP is filled from i = n-3 down to i = 0.

- For each i and j, it considers the count of j+1 in my cards and makes decisions based on that.

- Finally, it returns dp[0][0].

But I need to understand what i and j represent in this DP.

It's not clear from the code what i and j correspond to.

Maybe i represents the number of pairs left, and j represents something else.

Wait, in the problem, each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

So, there are n unique numbers, each with two cards.

Me and Nene each have n cards, meaning each number could be distributed between us in different ways.

Specifically, for each number from 1 to n, either:

- Both cards are in my hand.

- Both cards are in Nene's hand.

- One card is in my hand, and one is in Nene's hand.

Given that, I need to consider how the distribution affects the game.

Let's define:

- For each number x from 1 to n:

- If I have two x's, Nene has none.

- If I have one x, Nene has one x.

- If I have no x's, Nene has two x's.

So, for each number x, there are three possibilities.

Given that, perhaps the DP is tracking the number of pairs I have both cards of, the number of pairs I have one card of, and the number of pairs I have none of.

Wait, but in the code, it's just dp[i][j], and it's initialized for i from 0 to n, j from 0 to n.

I need to find a better way to model this.

Maybe I should think in terms of the number of pairs I can play to get points.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that:

- For each number x, if I have two x's, I can potentially get 1 point by playing the second x when the first is already on the table.

- If I have one x and Nene has one x, then whether I get a point depends on the order in which we play our x's.

Given that, perhaps I need to consider the number of pairs where I have both cards, and the number of pairs where I have one card.

Let me define:

- Let k be the number of numbers where I have both cards.

- Then, there are n - k numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

Because, for each number, if I have both, Nene has none; if I have one, Nene has one.

So, total numbers where I have one card is n - k, since I have n cards in total.

Wait, no.

Wait, I have n cards in total.

Each number from 1 to n appears twice.

So, if I have both cards of a number, that's one pair.

If I have one card of a number, then Nene has the other.

Let m be the number of pairs where I have both cards.

Then, the number of pairs where I have one card is n - m.

Because there are n pairs in total.

So, m pairs where I have both cards, and n - m pairs where I have one card and Nene has one card.

Given that, perhaps I can model the game based on m and n - m.

Now, I need to think about how the game progresses.

Each turn, me and Nene alternate playing cards.

I need to choose which card to play each time, considering what's already on the table.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems like a zero-sum game, and perhaps can be modeled using game theory.

But DP might be a way to optimize it.

I need to find a way to compute the maximum points I can get, given that Nene is playing optimally against me.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be using a DP table dp[i][j], where:

- i might represent the number of pairs where I have both cards remaining.

- j might represent something else.

But in the code, dp is initialized as dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)], so both i and j range from 0 to n.

Then, dp[n - 1][0] = 0 and dp[n - 2][0] = 0 are set explicitly.

Then, it iterates from i = n - 3 down to 0, and for each i, it iterates j from n - 1 down to 0.

In the inner loop, it checks cards.count(j + 1):

- If count is 0, dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]

- If count is 1, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)

- If count is 2, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])

Finally, it returns dp[0][0].

This seems a bit mysterious.

First, cards is a list of n integers, representing the numbers on my cards.

Then, cards.count(j + 1) gives how many times j + 1 appears in my cards.

Given that each number appears at most twice, cards.count(j + 1) can be 0, 1, or 2.

So, the DP transitions seem to be based on how many times j + 1 appears in my cards.

But I need to understand what i and j represent.

Maybe i represents the current step or something.

Wait, perhaps i represents the current number being considered, from 1 to n.

But i goes from n - 3 down to 0.

Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps i represents the number of remaining pairs where I have both cards.

Wait, in the initialization, dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] are set to 0.

This suggests that n - 1 and n - 2 are being used as indices.

But it's not clear.

Maybe I need to find another way to approach this.

Let me think about the game in terms of the possible moves and their outcomes.

Each time I play a card, I might get a point if the number is already on the table.

Similarly, Nene gets points when she plays a card that's already on the table.

Given that, I need to decide the order in which to play my cards to maximize my points, considering that Nene is also playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems complex because Nene's plays affect what's on the table, which in turn affects my potential points.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent game states, and edges represent moves.

But that might be too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the following:

- For numbers where I have both cards, I can potentially get 1 point by playing the second card after the first is already on the table.

- For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, whether I get a point depends on the order in which we play our cards.

In the latter case, Nene can choose to play her card before me, potentially denying me a point.

Given that, perhaps for each number where I have one card, I can only get a point if Nene doesn't play her card before I play mine.

But Nene is playing optimally to minimize my points.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of "conflicts" where both me and Nene have one card each.

Let me define:

- Let m be the number of numbers where I have both cards.

- Then, n - m is the number of numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

For the m numbers where I have both cards, I can potentially get 1 point from each by playing the second card after the first is on the table.

However, Nene can interfere by playing her cards in a way that affects my ability to get points from these m numbers.

Wait, but actually, since I have both cards for these m numbers, I can control when to play them.

Similarly, for the n - m numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, I can only get a point if Nene plays her card first, making my card a duplicate.

But Nene will try to minimize my points, so she will play her cards in a way that minimizes the chances of me getting points from these numbers.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can model this as follows:

- For the m numbers where I have both cards, I can get 1 point per number, provided that I play the second card after the first is on the table.

- For the n - m numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, I can get a point only if Nene plays her card first.

Given that, my total points would be:

- Points from m numbers: up to m points.

- Points from n - m numbers: up to n - m points, but Nene will try to minimize this.

But Nene can choose to play her cards in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes my points.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the sequence in which cards are played.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in games where two players take turns, and both play optimally, the game can often be analyzed using the concept of "Nimbers" or other game theory concepts.

But that might be too advanced for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of graph matching or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a bipartite graph where one set represents my moves and the other set represents Nene's moves, and edges represent possible sequences.

But this seems too complicated.

Let me try to find a simpler way.

Let me consider that:

- For each number where I have both cards, I can arrange to get 1 point.

- For each number where I have one card and Nene has one card, I might get 0 or 1 point, depending on the play order.

But Nene will try to minimize my points from these numbers.

So, perhaps, for the n - m numbers where I have one card each, I can only expect to get 0 points, because Nene will play her card in a way to prevent me from getting a point.

Therefore, my maximum points would be equal to m, the number of numbers where I have both cards.

But in the example, m = 2 (numbers 1 and 2), but the answer is 1.

Wait, in the first test case:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, for numbers:

- 1: I have both cards.

- 2: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 3: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 4: Nene has both cards.

So, m = 1 (only number 1)

Wait, wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought m was the number of numbers where I have both cards.

In this case, for number 1, I have both cards.

For number 2, I have one card, Nene has one card.

For number 3, I have one card, Nene has one card.

For number 4, Nene has both cards.

So, m = 1.

But according to the example, the answer is 1, which matches m.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, I could get 2 points in some sequences.

But according to this, m = 1, and the answer is 1.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to m, the number of numbers where I have both cards.

But in my simulation, I got 2 points in some sequences.

How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting m.

Wait, in the first test case:

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

Therefore, m = 1 (for number 1), and n - m = 3 - 1 = 2.

But the answer is 1, which matches m.

In the second test case:

n = 8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, numbers:

- 1: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 2: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 4: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 5: I have two cards.

- 7: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 8: I have two cards.

So, m = 2 (numbers 5 and 8)

And n - m = 6 - 2 = 4.

But in the example output, it's 2, which matches m.

Wait, but in the first test case, m = 1, and answer is 1.

In the second test case, m = 2, and answer is 2.

In the third test case:

n = 8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, numbers:

- 1: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 2: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 3: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 4: I have two cards.

- 5: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 6: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 7: I have one card, Nene has one card.

So, m = 1 (only number 4)

And n - m = 7 - 1 = 6.

But the answer is 1, which matches m.

In the fourth test case:

n = 3

My cards: 1,2,3

So, numbers:

- 1: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 2: I have one card, Nene has one card.

- 3: I have one card, Nene has one card.

So, m = 0

Answer is 0.

In the fifth test case:

n = 1

My cards: 1

So, numbers:

- 1: I have one card, Nene has one card.

m = 0

Answer is 0.

So, in all the examples, the answer matches m, the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Therefore, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to m, the number of numbers where I have both cards.

But earlier, in my simulation for the first test case, I could get 2 points in some sequences.

But according to this, m = 1, and the answer is 1.

So, perhaps, despite some sequences allowing me to get more points, Nene can prevent me from getting more than m points.

Hence, the maximum points I can get is m, the number of numbers where I have both cards.

If that's the case, then the solution is simply to count how many numbers I have both cards of.

In the code provided, it seems to be using DP, which might be overkill.

But perhaps there's more to it.

Let me check the first test case again.

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, m = 1 (only number 1)

But in one sequence, I got 2 points.

However, perhaps Nene can prevent that by playing optimally.

Hence, the maximum I can guarantee is m = 1.

Similarly, in the second test case, m = 2, and the answer is 2.

So, perhaps the answer is simply m.

Hence, the program should just count how many numbers I have both cards of.

In the code provided, it's doing something more complex with DP.

But according to my analysis, it's sufficient to count m.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the examples, it seems to be giving the correct answer.

But perhaps there are cases where m doesn't equal the answer.

Let me look for a counterexample.

Consider n = 2

My cards: 1,2

Nene's cards: 1,2

Here, m = 0

According to my earlier logic, I should get 0 points.

Indeed, in this case, no matter the order, I can't get any points because Nene can always play her card before me to prevent me from getting a point.

Hence, answer should be 0.

Another case:

n = 2

My cards: 1,1

Nene's cards: 2,2

Here, m = 1

I can get 1 point by playing one 1, then the other 1.

Nene plays 2, then 2.

I get 1 point.

Hence, answer is 1, which matches m.

Another case:

n = 3

My cards: 1,1,2

Nene's cards: 2,3,3

Here, m = 1 (only 1)

According to my logic, answer should be 1.

But let's simulate.

Possible game:

Me: play 1

Table: 1

Nene: play 2

Table: 1,2

Me: play 1

Get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table)

Nene: play 3

Table: 1,2,1,3

Me: play 2

Get 1 point (since 2 is already on the table)

Nene: play 3

Get 1 point.

Total: Me 2, Nene 2.

But according to my earlier logic, m = 1, but I got 2 points.

Hence, there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

In this case, m = 1, but I got 2 points.

Hence, the answer is not simply m.

Hence, my earlier conclusion is incorrect.

So, perhaps the DP in the code is necessary.

I need to understand the DP better.

Looking back at the code:

def func_1():

n = int(input())

cards = list(map(int, input().split()))

dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

dp[n - 1][0] = 0

dp[n - 2][0] = 0

for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):

for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:

dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]

elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)

else:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])

return dp[0][0]

I need to understand what i and j represent.

Let me assume that:

- i represents the current number being considered, from 1 to n.

- j represents some state related to the number of pairs where I have both cards.

But it's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps i represents the number of numbers considered so far, and j represents the number of pairs where I have both cards.

But I need to find a better way to interpret the DP.

Maybe I should look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that:

- For numbers where I have both cards, I can arrange to get 1 point from each.

- For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, whether I get a point depends on the order in which we play our cards.

Given that, perhaps the maximum points I can get is m plus the number of numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, but Nene can prevent me from getting points from these numbers.

Hence, perhaps the answer is m plus the floor division of (n - m) by 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, m = 1, n - m = 2, floor division of 2 by 2 is 1, so total points would be 2, which matches my earlier simulation.

But according to the example, the answer is 1.

Hence, this is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I can get m points plus some points from the n - m numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

But Nene can choose to play her cards in a way that minimizes my points from these n - m numbers.

Hence, perhaps I can get m points plus the number of n - m numbers where Nene plays her card after I play mine.

But it's still unclear.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define a function f(state) that gives the maximum points I can get from the current state, assuming both players play optimally.

The state would include:

- The set of cards on the table.

- The cards remaining in my hand.

- The cards remaining in Nene's hand.

But this is too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that:

- For each number where I have both cards, I can arrange to get 1 point.

- For each number where I have one card and Nene has one card, I can get a point only if Nene plays her card before I play mine.

Given that, perhaps the maximum points I can get is m plus the number of n - m numbers where Nene plays her card before I play mine.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Hence, she will try to play her cards in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

This seems too vague to model directly.

Perhaps I need to consider the game in terms of the number of "conflicts" where both me and Nene have one card each.

Let me define:

- Let m be the number of numbers where I have both cards.

- Let k be the number of numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

Then, n = m + k.

I can get m points from the m numbers where I have both cards.

For the k numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, I can potentially get points if Nene plays her card before I play mine.

But Nene can choose to play her cards in a way that minimizes my points.

Hence, perhaps the number of points I can get from these k numbers is floor(k / 2).

Wait, but in the first test case, m = 1, k = 2, floor(2 / 2) = 1, total points = 1 + 1 = 2, but the example answer is 1.

Hence, this is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I can get m points plus the ceiling of (k - m) / 2.

But in the first test case, m = 1, k = 2, ceiling((2 - 1)/2) = ceiling(0.5) = 1, total points = 1 + 1 = 2, which again contradicts the example answer of 1.

Hence, this is also incorrect.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that for each of the k numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, Nene can choose to play her card either before or after I play mine.

If she plays her card before I play mine, then I can get a point.

But if she plays her card after I play mine, then I don't get a point.

Nene wants to minimize my points, so she will choose to play her card after I play mine for as many of these k numbers as possible.

Hence, perhaps the number of points I can get from these k numbers is the number of times Nene plays her card before I play mine.

But Nene will minimize this.

Hence, perhaps I can get m points plus the floor of k / 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, m = 1, k = 2, floor(2 / 2) = 1, total points = 1 + 1 = 2, but the answer is 1.

Hence, this is still incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Nene can pair her cards with my cards in such a way that minimizes my points.

Hence, for each of the k numbers, Nene can choose to play her card before or after I play mine.

To minimize my points, she will play her card after I play mine as much as possible.

Hence, the number of points I can get from these k numbers is ceil((k - m)/2).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have m numbers with both cards, and k = n - m numbers with one card each.

I can arrange to get m points from the m numbers.

For the k numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, Nene can choose to play her card before or after I play mine.

To minimize my points, she will play her card after I play mine for as many of these k numbers as possible.

Hence, the number of points I can get from these k numbers is floor((k)/2).

But in the first test case, m = 1, k = 2, floor(2/2) = 1, total points = 1 + 1 = 2, but the answer is 1.

Hence, this is still not matching.

Wait, perhaps Nene can completely prevent me from getting points from the k numbers by always playing her card after I play mine.

Hence, I can only get m points.

Hence, the answer is m.

But in my earlier simulation, I could get 2 points.

However, perhaps Nene can prevent that by playing optimally.

Hence, perhaps the answer is m.

Hence, in the code, it's trying to compute something more complex, but perhaps the answer is simply m.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

But in the second test case, m = 2, and the answer is 2.

In the third test case, m = 1, and the answer is 1.

In the fourth test case, m = 0, and the answer is 0.

In the fifth test case, m = 0, and the answer is 0.

Hence, it seems that the answer is m.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

But in my earlier simulation for the first test case, I could get 2 points.

However, perhaps Nene can prevent that by playing optimally.

Hence, perhaps the maximum points I can get is m.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

But according to the examples, the answer seems to be m.

Hence, perhaps the DP in the code is unnecessary, and the answer is simply m.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

But in the third test case, m = 1, and the answer is 1.

But in my earlier simulation for the first test case, I could get 2 points.

Hence, perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for the m numbers where I have both cards, I can arrange to get m points, and for the k numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, I can get floor(k / 2) points.

But in the first test case, m = 1, k = 2, floor(2 / 2) = 1, total points = 2, but the answer is 1.

Hence, this is still not matching.

Hence, perhaps the answer is m plus floor((k - m) / 2).

In the first test case, m = 1, k = 2, floor((2 - 1)/2) = floor(0.5) = 0, total points = 1 + 0 = 1, which matches the
