Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a strip of n cells, each either white ('W') or black ('B'). I need to choose one continuous segment to paint white, and after painting, all the black cells in that segment become white, while the white ones stay white. The goal is to find the minimum length of such a segment that, when painted, will make the entire strip white.

First, I need to understand what it means to paint a segment white. If I choose a segment from cell i to cell j, all 'B's in that segment become 'W's. I need to ensure that after this operation, there are no 'B's left in the entire strip.

So, the strategy should be to find a segment such that all 'B's in the strip are covered by this segment. That way, painting this segment will turn all 'B's to 'W's, and the cells already 'W' stay 'W', making the whole strip 'W'.

Wait, but the problem says "all the black cells in this segment will become white, and the white ones will remain white." So, it's not that the segment is painted white, overwriting everything to 'W', but rather that the 'B's in the segment become 'W's.

But actually, re-reading the problem, it says: "You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white. After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and the white ones will remain white."

So, it's明确that only the 'B's in the chosen segment become 'W's, and the 'W's stay 'W's. The cells outside the segment remain unchanged.

Therefore, to make the entire strip 'W', I need to ensure that all 'B's are included in the segment I choose to paint, because only those 'B's will be turned to 'W's.

Hence, the minimal segment should cover all the 'B's with the smallest possible length.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me see the example.

In the first test case:

6

WBBWBW

The output is 4.

Let's see:

Positions:

1: W

2: B

3: B

4: W

5: B

6: W

So, 'B's are at positions 2,3,5.

If I choose from position 2 to 5, that's 4 cells (2,3,4,5), which includes all 'B's. After painting, the 'B's in positions 2,3,5 become 'W's, and position 4 is already 'W', so it stays 'W'. So the whole strip becomes 'W'.

But if I try a smaller segment, say positions 2 to 4 (length 3):

Original: W B B W B W

After painting positions 2 to 4: W W W W B W

Still have a 'B' at position 5. So, not all 'B's are covered.

Another try: positions 2 to 5 (length 4): W B B W B W -> W W W W W W, which is all 'W's.

So, indeed, the minimal segment length is 4.

Another test case:

1

B

Output: 1

Obviously, just paint the single cell.

Another test case:

2

WB

Output: 1

Here, 'B' is at position 2. Painting position 2 (length 1) will make it 'W'.

Another test case:

3

BBW

Output: 2

'B's at positions 1,2.

Paint positions 1 and 2: B B W -> W W W

So, length 2.

Another test case:

4

BWWB

Output: 4

'B's at positions 1 and 4.

If I paint positions 1 to 4 (length 4): B W W B -> W W W W

But is there a smaller segment?

If I paint positions 1 to 3: B W W B -> W W W B (still 'B' at position 4)

If I paint positions 2 to 4: B W W B -> B W W W (still 'B' at position 1)

So, minimal length is 4.

Another test case:

6

BWBWWB

Output: 6

'B's at positions 1,3,6.

If I paint positions 1 to 6: BWBWWB -> WWWWWB -> WWWWWW

But wait, according to the problem, painting positions 1 to 6 should turn all 'B's in that segment to 'W's, so it should work.

But is there a smaller segment?

Try positions 1 to 5: BWBWWB -> WWWWWB -> WWWWWW (position 6 is already covered)

Wait, no, position 6 is outside the segment, so it remains 'B'. Wait, no, position 6 is included in the segment if I choose positions 1 to 6.

Wait, the output is 6, but maybe there's a mistake.

Wait, no, in the example, the output is 6 for input BWBWWB.

But according to my reasoning, if I paint positions 1 to 6, it should turn all 'B's to 'W's.

But if I try positions 1 to 5: BWBWWB -> WWWWWB, then position 6 is still 'B', so I need to include position 6.

So, indeed, minimal length is 6.

Another test case:

6

WWBBWB

Output: 4

'B's at positions 4,5,6.

If I paint positions 4 to 7 (but n=6), so positions 4 to 6: WWBBWB -> WWWWWB -> WWWWWW

Wait, positions 4 to 6: 'B','B','W' -> 'W','W','W'

So, the whole strip becomes 'W's.

Is there a smaller segment?

If I paint positions 4 to 5: WWBBWB -> WWWBWB -> WWWBWB, still 'B' at position 6.

So, minimal length is 4.

Last test case:

9

WBWBWWWBW

Output: 7

'B's at positions 2,4,9.

If I paint positions 2 to 8: WBWBWWWBW -> WWBWWWWWW -> WWWWWWWWW

Wait, positions 2 to 8: 'B','B','W','W','W','W','B' -> 'W','W','W','W','W','W','W'

Position 9 is outside the segment, so it remains 'B'. So, not good.

Wait, the correct painting should be positions 2 to 9: WBWBWWWBW -> WWBWWWWWW -> WWWWWWWWW

But that's length 8, but the output is 7.

Wait, maybe positions 3 to 9: BWBWWWBW -> WWWWWWW (assuming the 'B's are covered)

Wait, original: W B W B W W W B W

Positions 3 to 9: W B W B W W W B W -> W W W W W W W W W

Wait, positions 3 to 9: 'W','B','W','B','W','W','W','B','W' -> 'W','W','W','W','W','W','W','W','W'

Yes, that works, and length is 7.

Is there a smaller segment?

Try positions 2 to 8: B W B W W W B W -> W W W W W W W W

Still, position 9 is 'B', but in this segment, so it should be covered.

Wait, positions 2 to 8: 'B','W','B','W','W','W','B' -> 'W','W','W','W','W','W','W'

Position 9 is outside, so it remains 'B'. No, wait, in the original string, position 9 is 'W', so it should be 'W'.

Wait, original string: W B W B W W W B W

So, positions 2 to 8: 'B','W','B','W','W','W','B' -> 'W','W','W','W','W','W','W'

Position 9 is 'W', so it remains 'W'. So, whole strip is 'W's.

But why does the sample output say 7?

Wait, maybe positions 3 to 9: 'W','B','W','B','W','W','W','B','W' -> 'W','W','W','W','W','W','W','W','W'

That's length 7.

Is there a smaller segment?

Try positions 4 to 9: 'W','B','W','B','W','W','W','B','W' -> 'W','B','W','W','W','W','W','W','W'

Still 'B' at position 2.

Wait, no, position 2 is outside the segment, so it remains 'B'.

Wait, no, in the original strip, position 2 is 'B', which is outside the segment, so it remains 'B'.

So, whole strip is not all 'W's.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 7, which corresponds to positions 3 to 9.

Is there a smaller segment?

What if I choose positions 2 to 7: 'B','W','B','W','W','W','B','W' -> 'W','W','W','W','W','W','B','W'

Still 'B' at position 8.

So, need to include position 8 in the segment.

Positions 2 to 8: 'B','W','B','W','W','W','B' -> 'W','W','W','W','W','W','W'

Position 9 is 'W', so remains 'W'.

So, length 7.

Positions 2 to 9: length 8, but positions 3 to 9: length 7.

So, minimal length is 7.

Okay, now I see the pattern.

So, the task is to find the minimal length of a contiguous segment that includes all the 'B's, such that painting this segment will turn all 'B's to 'W's.

In other words, find the smallest segment that covers all the 'B's.

Wait, but in the fourth test case:

4

BWWB

Output: 4

But there are 'B's at positions 1 and 4.

So, to cover both, the minimal segment is from 1 to 4, which is length 4.

There is no smaller segment that covers both 'B's.

Hence, the minimal length is 4.

Another way to think about it is to find the minimal length of a segment that includes all the 'B's.

So, find the leftmost 'B' and the rightmost 'B', and the minimal segment is from the leftmost 'B' to the rightmost 'B'.

The length of this segment is (rightmost 'B' position - leftmost 'B' position + 1).

But in the first test case:

6

WBBWBW

'B's at positions 2,3,5.

So, leftmost 'B' at position 2, rightmost at position 5.

Length from 2 to 5 is 4.

Which matches the sample output.

In the third test case:

2

WB

'B' at position 2.

So, minimal segment is position 2, length 1.

In the fourth test case:

4

BWWB

'B's at positions 1 and 4.

Minimal segment is from 1 to 4, length 4.

In the sixth test case:

6

BWBWWB

'B's at positions 1,3,6.

Leftmost 'B' at 1, rightmost at 6.

Length from 1 to 6 is 6.

In the seventh test case:

6

WWBBWB

'B's at positions 4,5,6.

Leftmost 'B' at 4, rightmost at 6.

Length from 4 to 6 is 3.

But in the sample output, it's 4.

Wait, but in the sample output for the seventh test case, it's 4, but according to this, it should be 3.

Wait, no, in the seventh test case:

6

WWBBWB

'B's at positions 4,5,6.

If I choose positions 4 to 6, length 3.

Original: W W B B W B

After painting positions 4 to 6: W W W W W B

Still 'B' at position 6 remains, because position 6 is included in the segment, 'B' becomes 'W'.

Wait, no, position 6 is already in the segment, so 'B' becomes 'W'.

So, whole strip becomes W W W W W W.

So, length 3 should work.

But in the sample output, it's 4.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, no, positions 4 to 6: 'B','B','W' -> 'W','W','W'

So, whole strip: W W W W W W.

No 'B's left.

So, why is the sample output 4?

Wait, maybe I need to recheck the sample input and output.

Wait, in the sample input, it's:

6

WWBBWB

And output is 4.

But according to my reasoning, length 3 should suffice.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white. After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and the white ones will remain white."

So, only the 'B's in the segment become 'W's, 'W's remain 'W's, and cells outside the segment remain unchanged.

In the seventh test case:

6

WWBBWB

'B's at positions 4,5,6.

If I choose positions 4 to 6:

'B','B','W' -> 'W','W','W'

Whole strip becomes W W W W W W.

So, length 3 should be sufficient.

But the sample output is 4.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe there's a constraint I didn't notice.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says: "the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)", and for each test case, "the length of the strip n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10)", and "it is guaranteed that at least one cell is black."

Given that n can be up to 10, and t up to 10^4, it's a small input size, so efficiency shouldn't be a concern.

But back to the seventh test case: according to the sample output, it's 4, but according to my reasoning, it should be 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

8

6

WBBWBW

1

B

2

WB

3

BBW

4

BWWB

6

BWBWWB

6

WWBBWB

9

WBWBWWWBW

Output:

4

1

1

2

4

6

4

7

So, for the seventh test case, n=6, s=WWBBWB, output=4.

But according to my earlier reasoning, choosing positions 4 to 6 (length 3) should suffice.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample output.

Or maybe I miscounted the positions.

Wait, positions:

1: W

2: W

3: B

4: B

5: W

6: B

So, 'B's at positions 3,4,6.

If I choose positions 3 to 6: 'B','B','W','B' -> 'W','W','W','W'

Whole strip: W W W W W W.

So, length 4.

But positions 4 to 6: 'B','W','B' -> 'W','W','W'

Whole strip: W W W W W W.

So, length 3 also works.

So, perhaps the minimal length is 3, but the sample output is 4.

Maybe there's a mistake in the sample output.

Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is to find the minimal length that covers all 'B's and possibly some 'W's, but the minimal possible is when covering from the first 'B' to the last 'B', including any 'W's in between.

But in the seventh test case, 'B's are at positions 3,4,6.

So, from position 3 to 6: 'B','B','W','B' -> 'W','W','W','W'

That's length 4.

Alternatively, positions 3 to 5: 'B','B','W' -> 'W','W','W'

But position 6 is 'B', which is outside this segment, so it remains 'B'.

Wait, no, position 6 is 'B', but it's not included in positions 3 to 5, so it remains 'B'.

Therefore, the whole strip would be W W W W W B, which still has a 'B'.

Hence, positions 3 to 5 are not sufficient.

Wait, but earlier I thought positions 4 to 6 would cover 'B's at positions 4 and 6, but position 3 is still 'B'.

Wait, no, in positions 4 to 6: 'B','W','B' -> 'W','W','W'

But position 3 is outside this segment, so it remains 'B'.

Therefore, the whole strip becomes W W B W W W, which still has a 'B' at position 3.

So, positions 4 to 6 (length 3) do not cover all 'B's.

I must have made a mistake earlier.

So, to cover all 'B's at positions 3,4,6, I need to choose a segment that includes positions 3 to 6, which is length 4.

Then, positions 3 to 6: 'B','B','W','B' -> 'W','W','W','W'

Whole strip: W W W W W W.

Yes, that works.

Positions 3 to 6: length 4.

Positions 3 to 5: 'B','B','W' -> 'W','W','W', but position 6 'B' remains.

Positions 4 to 6: 'B','W','B' -> 'W','W','W', but position 3 'B' remains.

Hence, minimal length is 4.

So, my earlier mistake was in thinking that positions 4 to 6 would cover all 'B's, but it doesn't cover the 'B' at position 3.

Therefore, the minimal segment must cover from the first 'B' at position 3 to the last 'B' at position 6, which is length 4.

Hence, the general approach is to find the leftmost 'B' and the rightmost 'B', and the minimal segment is from the leftmost 'B' to the rightmost 'B', inclusive.

The length of this segment is (rightmost 'B' position - leftmost 'B' position + 1).

This seems to work for all the sample inputs.

In the first test case:

'W B B W B W'

'B's at positions 2,3,5.

Leftmost 'B' at 2, rightmost at 5.

Length: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.

Sample output: 4.

In the seventh test case:

'W W B B W B'

'B's at positions 3,4,6.

Leftmost 'B' at 3, rightmost at 6.

Length: 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.

Sample output: 4.

In the sixth test case:

'B W B W W B'

'B's at positions 1,3,6.

Leftmost 'B' at 1, rightmost at 6.

Length: 6 - 1 + 1 = 6.

Sample output: 6.

In the fourth test case:

'B W W B'

'B's at positions 1,4.

Length: 4 - 1 + 1 = 4.

Sample output: 4.

In the third test case:

'W B'

'B' at position 2.

Length: 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.

Sample output: 1.

In the second test case:

'B'

'B' at position 1.

Length: 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.

Sample output: 1.

In the fifth test case:

'B B W'

'B's at positions 1,2.

Length: 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.

Sample output: 2.

In the eighth test case:

'W B W B W W W B W'

'B's at positions 2,4,8,9.

Leftmost 'B' at 2, rightmost at 9.

Length: 9 - 2 + 1 = 8.

But the sample output is 7.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, in the eighth test case, 'B's are at positions 2,4,8,9.

So, from position 2 to 9: length 8.

But sample output is 7.

Wait, maybe positions 3 to 9: positions 3 to 9 include 'B's at positions 4,8,9.

But position 2 'B' is outside this segment, so it would remain 'B'.

Hence, not all 'B's are covered.

So, positions 2 to 9: 'B','W','B','W','W','W','B','W' -> 'W','W','W','W','W','W','W','W'

Whole strip: W W W W W W W W.

But position 9 is 'W', but in the original, it's 'W', so it remains 'W'.

Wait, in the original strip: W B W B W W W B W

So, positions 2,4,8,9 are 'B's.

If I paint positions 2 to 9: 'B','W','B','W','W','W','B','W' -> 'W','W','W','W','W','W','W','W'

Position 9 is 'B', but in the original, it's 'W', so maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, the original strip is W B W B W W W B W.

Positions: 1:W, 2:B, 3:W, 4:B, 5:W, 6:W, 7:W, 8:B, 9:W.

So, 'B's at positions 2,4,8.

Wait, position 9 is 'W'.

So, to cover 'B's at positions 2,4,8, the minimal segment is from 2 to 8, length 7.

Positions 2 to 8: 'B','W','B','W','W','W','B' -> 'W','W','W','W','W','W','W'

Position 9 is 'W', so remains 'W'.

Hence, whole strip becomes W W W W W W W W W.

So, minimal length is 7.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought position 9 was 'B', but it's 'W'.

Hence, positions 2 to 8: length 7.

So, the general approach is to find the leftmost 'B' and the rightmost 'B', and the minimal segment is from leftmost 'B' to rightmost 'B', inclusive.

The length is rightmost 'B' position - leftmost 'B' position + 1.

This seems consistent with all the sample inputs.

Hence, in the program provided, it seems to be implementing this logic.

Looking at the code:

def func_1():

ma = mi = 0

m = int(input())

s = input()

c = d = 0

l = []

for j in s:

c += 1

if j == 'B':

mi = c

break

for j in s[::-1]:

d += 1

if j == 'B':

ma = len(s) - d

break

return ma - mi + 2

So, it's trying to find the leftmost 'B' (mi) and the rightmost 'B' (ma), and then compute the length as ma - mi + 1.

But in the code, it's returning ma - mi + 2.

Wait, that seems off.

In the first loop, it finds the first 'B' and sets mi to its position.

In the second loop, it iterates the string in reverse, finds the first 'B' encountered, sets ma to its position.

Then, it returns ma - mi + 2.

But should it be ma - mi + 1?

Wait, let's check with the first test case:

s = 'W B B W B W'

positions: 1:W, 2:B, 3:B, 4:W, 5:B, 6:W

mi = 2 (first 'B')

ma = 5 (last 'B')

ma - mi + 1 = 4, which matches the sample output.

But the code returns ma - mi + 2 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, which is not correct.

Wait, that's incorrect.

So, the code is wrong here.

It should be ma - mi + 1.

But in the code, it's ma - mi + 2.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for the first test case, it's giving output 4, which is correct, but according to the code, ma - mi + 2 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, which is not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps in the code, ma and mi are 0-based or something.

Wait, let's see:

s = 'W B B W B W'

c starts at 0.

First 'B' is at position 2 (c=2), so mi=2.

Then, s[::-1] is 'W B W B B W'

d starts at 0.

First 'B' in reverse is position 1 (d=1), which corresponds to position 6 - 1 = 5.

So, ma = 6 - 1 = 5.

Then, ma - mi + 2 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, but the sample output is 4.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the author intended ma - mi + 1, but wrote +2 by mistake.

Or perhaps there's some off-by-one error.

Wait, in the fourth test case:

s = 'B W W B'

mi =1 (first 'B')

ma =4 (last 'B')

ma - mi +2 =4-1+2=5, but the sample output is 4.

So, incorrect.

In the third test case:

s='W B'

mi=2

ma=2

ma - mi +2=2-2+2=2, but sample output is 1.

Incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the author is considering the segment from mi-1 to ma.

But then ma - (mi-1) +1 = ma - mi +2, which is what the code does.

But in the first test case, ma=5, mi=2, ma - mi +2=5, but the correct output is 4.

So, still incorrect.

There's a mistake here.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
