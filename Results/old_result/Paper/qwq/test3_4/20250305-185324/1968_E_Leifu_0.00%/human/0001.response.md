Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to choose n cells in an n by n grid. These cells are specified by their coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these chosen cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is just the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates: |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

I need to output the coordinates of these n cells for each test case, and there can be up to 50 test cases. Each n can be as large as 1000, which sounds a bit tricky in terms of computation, but I think I can handle it.

First, I need to understand what the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances is for a given n. In the examples provided, for n=2, the maximum size of H is 2, which makes sense because you can have distances 0 and 1. For n=3, it's 4, including distances 0,1,2,3.

I need to find a way to place these n cells such that the number of unique distances is maximized.

Looking at the examples:

- For n=2:

(1,1) and (1,2)

Distances: |1-1| + |1-1| = 0

|1-1| + |2-2| = 0

|1-1| + |1-2| = 1

So H = {0,1}, size 2.

- For n=3:

(2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances:

|2-2| + |1-3| = 2

|2-3| + |1-1| = 1

|2-3| + |3-1| = 3

Plus the zeros from same cell distances.

So H = {0,1,2,3}, size 4.

- For n=4:

(1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Distances:

|1-1| + |3-3| = 0

|1-4| + |3-3| = 3

|1-4| + |3-4| = 4

|1-1| + |3-4| = 1

|4-4| + |3-4| = 1

|4-4| + |4-4| = 0

Wait, this seems to have distances 0,1,3,4.

But according to the problem, for n=4, the maximum size is 5.

Wait, maybe I'm missing some pairs.

Let me list all pairs for n=4:

Points: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Distances:

(1,1)-(1,3): |1-1| + |1-3| = 2

(1,1)-(4,3): |1-4| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5

Wait, |1-4| is 3, |1-3| is 2, so 3 + 2 = 5?

Wait, no, Manhattan distance is |delta x| + |delta y|, so |1-4| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5, yes.

(1,1)-(4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

(1,3)-(4,3): |1-4| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3

(1,3)-(4,4): |1-4| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4

(4,3)-(4,4): |4-4| + |3-4| = 0 + 1 = 1

So H = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, but some are missing.

Wait, in the example for n=4, it shows a different set of points.

Wait, in the problem's example for n=4:

"1 1

1 3

4 3

4 4"

So, points are (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

From above, distances are 2,5,6,3,4,1.

So H = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6.

But the problem says for n=4, the maximum is 5?

Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, no, looking back, in the problem statement, for n=4, it shows:

"1 1

1 3

4 3

4 4"

And says it's a possible arrangement.

But according to my calculation, H has size 6.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Let me recalculate:

Points: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Distances:

(1,1)-(1,3): |0| + |2| = 2

(1,1)-(4,3): |3| + |2| = 5

(1,1)-(4,4): |3| + |3| = 6

(1,3)-(4,3): |3| + |0| = 3

(1,3)-(4,4): |3| + |1| = 4

(4,3)-(4,4): |0| + |1| = 1

So H = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 6.

But in the note, for n=3, H has size 4, which is correct.

For n=4, is 6 the maximum?

Wait, for n=4, what's the maximum possible distinct Manhattan distances?

Well, the Manhattan distance can range from 0 up to 2(n-1).

For n=4, 2*(4-1) = 6, so distances from 0 to 6.

So H can be {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7.

But in this arrangement, we have {1,2,3,4,5,6}, missing 0.

But actually, in the problem's example, they have points like (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4), which includes (1,1) and (1,1), which would have distance 0.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I only considered distinct pairs, but distance 0 is included for each point to itself.

So H should include 0.

Wait, but in programming terms, do I need to consider distance from a point to itself?

Probably yes, since the problem says "any pair of cells", which includes pairs where both are the same cell.

So H should include 0.

Hence, for n=4, H should be {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7.

But in the problem's example for n=4, they have:

"1 1

1 3

4 3

4 4"

Which gives distances {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7.

Wait, but in the problem's note, for n=4, they show a different arrangement:

"1 1

1 3

4 3

4 4"

Which, as I calculated, gives H of size 7.

But earlier I thought it was 6, but actually it's 7 because it includes 0.

So, the maximum for n=4 is 7.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for n=4, they say:

"For n=4 a possible arrangement is:"

And show the points, but they don't specify the size of H.

But from the example output, for n=4, they have 4 points, and H has size 7.

Similarly, for n=5, H would have size up to 9, for n=6, up to 11, and so on.

Wait, no, for general n, the maximum H size should be 2n-1.

Wait, but for n=2, H has size 2, which is 2*2 -1 = 3, but they have 2.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, for n=2, H can have size 2, {0,1}, but 2n-1 = 3, which is more than possible.

Wait, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, let's think differently.

What's the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances possible for n points in an n x n grid?

Well, the Manhattan distance can range from 0 to 2(n-1), but not all distances may be achievable depending on the arrangement of points.

So, for n=2, distances can be 0,1,2.

But in their example for n=2, H has size 2, {0,1}.

Wait, but distance 2 is achievable in n=2.

For points (1,1) and (2,2), distance is |1-2| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, H should be {0,1,2}, size 3.

But in their example, they have points (1,1) and (1,2), which gives distances 0 and 1.

So, it's possible to have H of size 2, but actually, by choosing different points, you can achieve H of size 3.

So, perhaps their example is not showing the optimal arrangement.

Wait, but in the note, they say "In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is: points (1,1) and (1,2). In this case H={0,1}. It can be shown that it is the greatest possible answer."

Wait, but according to my calculation, H can be {0,1,2}, which is greater than 2.

So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, no, perhaps I misread their explanation.

In their first example for n=2, they have points (1,1) and (1,2), giving H={0,1}.

But they claim that it's the greatest possible, which seems incorrect because with points (1,1) and (2,2), you get H={0,1,2}.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps for n=2, H can be at most 2, not 3.

Wait, but (1,1) and (2,2) give distances 0 and 2.

Wait, no, between (1,1) and (2,2), distance is 2.

Also, (1,1) to itself is 0, (2,2) to itself is 0.

So H={0,2}.

Wait, but in their example, with points (1,1) and (1,2), H={0,1}.

So, in both cases, H has size 2.

Wait, perhaps for n=2, the maximum H size is 2.

Wait, but with points (1,1) and (2,1), distances are 0 and 1.

With points (1,1) and (2,2), distances are 0 and 2.

So, in both cases, H has size 2.

Is there a way to get H of size 3 for n=2?

If I choose points (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2), but that's n=3, which is different.

So, for n=2, H can be {0,1} or {0,2}, both of size 2.

So, the maximum H size is 2 for n=2.

Wait, but for n=3, in their example, H has size 4.

Wait, but for n=3, is 4 the maximum?

Let's see.

For n=3, the maximum possible distinct Manhattan distances would be from 0 to 4.

But in their example for n=3, they have points (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).

Distances:

(2,1)-(2,3): |0| + |2| = 2

(2,1)-(3,1): |1| + |0| = 1

(2,3)-(3,1): |1| + |2| = 3

Plus distances from points to themselves: 0.

So H = {0,1,2,3}, size 4.

Is there a way to get a larger H for n=3?

Let's try a different arrangement.

Suppose I choose points (1,1), (2,2), (3,3).

Distances:

(1,1)-(2,2): 2

(1,1)-(3,3): 4

(2,2)-(3,3): 2

Plus zeros.

So H = {0,2,4}, size 3.

Which is less than the previous arrangement.

So, their arrangement with H of size 4 seems better.

Is there an arrangement for n=3 with H of size 5?

Let me try points (1,1), (2,3), (3,2).

Distances:

(1,1)-(2,3): 3

(1,1)-(3,2): 4

(2,3)-(3,2): 2

Plus zeros.

So H = {0,2,3,4}, size 4.

Same as before.

Another arrangement: (1,1), (1,3), (3,3).

Distances:

(1,1)-(1,3): 2

(1,1)-(3,3): 4

(1,3)-(3,3): 2

Plus zeros.

H = {0,2,4}, size 3.

So, seems like {0,1,2,3} is better.

Hence, for n=3, maximum H size is 4.

Similarly, for n=4, in their example, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7.

Wait, but earlier I thought H could be up to 2n-1, but for n=2, 2*2-1=3, but maximum H is 2.

Wait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, for general n, what's the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances possible with n points in an n x n grid?

Well, the Manhattan distance can range from 0 to 2(n-1), but not all distances may be achievable depending on the point arrangement.

So, perhaps the maximum H size is min(n(n-1)/2 +1, 2n-1).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the maximum H size is 2n-1.

Wait, for n=2, 2*2-1=3, but maximum H is 2.

For n=3, 2*3-1=5, but their example has H of size 4.

So, perhaps 2n-1 is not the correct upper bound.

Wait, perhaps it's n(n-1)/2 +1.

For n=2, that's 1+1=2, matching their example.

For n=3, 3+1=4, matching their example.

For n=4, 6+1=7, which matches their n=4 example.

For n=5, 10+1=11, but in their n=5 example, they have H of size 6.

Wait, but according to this, for n=5, H should be up to 11, but in their example, it's 6.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Looking back at their n=5 example:

"1 1

1 3

1 4

2 1

5 5"

Distances:

(1,1)-(1,3): 2

(1,1)-(1,4): 3

(1,1)-(2,1): 1

(1,1)-(5,5): 8

(1,3)-(1,4): 1

(1,3)-(2,1): 3

(1,3)-(5,5): 6

(1,4)-(2,1): 4

(1,4)-(5,5): 5

(2,1)-(5,5): 7

Plus zeros.

So H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9.

But according to my earlier formula, n(n-1)/2 +1 for n=5 is 10+1=11, but here H has size 9, which is less than 11.

So perhaps that formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the maximum H size is (2n-1 choose 1) +1, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of unique sums of |delta x| + |delta y|, where delta x and delta y range from 0 to n-1.

Wait, for any pair of points, |x1 - x2| can be from 0 to n-1, same for |y1 - y2|.

So, the Manhattan distance can be from 0 to 2(n-1).

But not all sums between 0 and 2(n-1) may be achievable, depending on the point arrangement.

For example, for n=2, distances can be 0,1,2.

For n=3, distances can be 0,1,2,3,4.

For n=4, 0 to 6.

So, for general n, the maximum H size is 2n-1.

But in their n=5 example, H has size 9, which is less than 2*5 -1 =9.

Wait, 2*5 -1=9, which matches their n=5 example.

Wait, perhaps I misread earlier.

Wait, 2n-1 for n=5 would be 9, which matches their n=5 example.

Wait, but earlier I thought 2n-1 was not matching for n=3, but for n=3, 2*3-1=5, but their n=3 example has H of size 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the maximum H size is min(n(n-1)/2 +1, 2n-1).

For n=2, min(3,3)=3, but in their example, H has size 2.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n choose 2 +1, which for n=2 is 1+1=2, matching their example.

For n=3, 3+1=4, matching their example.

For n=4, 6+1=7, matching their example.

For n=5, 10+1=11, but their example has H=9.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum H size is n(n-1)/2 +1 - something.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum H size is the number of unique sums of |delta x| + |delta y| for all possible pairs.

Given that delta x and delta y can each be from 0 to n-1, the possible Manhattan distances are from 0 to 2(n-1), in steps of 1.

So, in theory, H can be as large as 2n-1.

But whether all these distances are achievable depends on the point arrangement.

So, the challenge is to arrange n points in the n x n grid such that the number of unique Manhattan distances between any two points is maximized.

Given that, I need to find a strategy to place these n points to maximize H.

Looking at their examples:

- For n=2: points (1,1) and (1,2), H={0,1}

But as I saw earlier, choosing (1,1) and (2,2) gives H={0,2}, which is also size 2.

But in n=2, it's impossible to get H of size 3, because there are only two points, hence only one distinct distance besides 0.

Wait, no, with n points, there are n(n-1)/2 distinct pairs, hence up to that many unique distances.

For n=2, only one pair, so H can have at most 2 elements: 0 and one other distance.

Hence, for n=2, H can have at most 2 elements.

Similarly, for n=3, up to 4 elements in H.

Wait, but for n=3, n(n-1)/2=3, but H can have 4 elements, including 0 and three other distances.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of unique distances besides 0 and see if it matches.

Wait, no, H includes 0 as well.

So, for n points, H includes 0 and the distances between different pairs.

Hence, the challenge is to maximize the number of unique distances.

Now, to maximize the number of unique distances, I need to choose points such that the distances between them are as diverse as possible.

One way to achieve this is to maximize the spread of the points.

For example, placing points on a diagonal maximizes the distances between them.

Wait, but in their n=4 example, points are not all on the diagonal.

They have points (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4).

This arrangement seems to cover a variety of distances.

Alternatively, placing points in a way that no two pairs have the same distance.

But for larger n, this might not be possible.

So, perhaps a strategy is to place points in a way that minimizes distance overlaps.

Alternatively, perhaps placing points in a way that they are spread out to cover as many possible distances as possible.

Looking at their examples:

- n=2: (1,1) and (1,2)

Distances: 0 and 1

- n=3: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances: 0,1,2,3

- n=4: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6

- n=5: (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

Distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

- n=6: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)

Distances: likely 0 up to some value.

Looking at these arrangements, it seems like they are trying to cover as much range as possible by placing points at various positions, including corners and edges.

So, perhaps a general strategy is:

- Place one point at (1,1)

- Place another point at (1,n)

- Place another point at (n,1)

- And so on, covering different rows and columns to maximize distance variety.

But I need to generalize this for any n.

Looking at their n=4 example:

(1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

This seems like they are placing points in different rows and columns to maximize the distances.

Similarly, for n=5:

(1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

Again, spreading out the points.

So, perhaps a general approach is:

- Place the first point at (1,1)

- Place the second point at (1,2)

- For n >=3, place the third point at (2,3)

- And continue placing points in a way that maximizes the spread.

But I need to find a pattern or formula that can be applied for any n up to 1000.

Looking at the given program, it seems like it's trying to do something similar.

Let's look at the program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

print('1 1')

print('1 2')

if n == 3:

print('2 3')

else:

print('2 4')

for j in range(4, n + 1):

print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



So, for each test case:

- Read n

- Output points (1,1), (1,2)

- If n==3, output (2,3)

- Else, output (2,4)

- Then, for j from 4 to n, output (j,j)

So, for n=2:

Points: (1,1), (1,2)

For n=3:

Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

For n=4:

Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

For n=5:

Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

And so on.

Now, let's verify if this arrangement maximizes H for each n.

First, for n=2:

Points: (1,1), (1,2)

Distances: 0 and 1

H = {0,1}, size 2, which is the maximum for n=2.

For n=3:

Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

Distances:

(1,1)-(1,2): 1

(1,1)-(2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

(1,2)-(2,3): |1-2| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2

Plus zeros.

H = {0,1,2,3}, size 4, which matches their example.

For n=4:

Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

Distances:

(1,1)-(1,2): 1

(1,1)-(2,4): |1-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4

(1,1)-(4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

(1,2)-(2,4): |1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3

(1,2)-(4,4): |1-4| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5

(2,4)-(4,4): |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2

Plus zeros.

H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7, which matches their example.

For n=5:

Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

Distances:

(1,1)-(1,2): 1

(1,1)-(2,4): 4

(1,1)-(4,4): 6

(1,1)-(5,5): |1-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8

(1,2)-(2,4): 3

(1,2)-(4,4): 5

(1,2)-(5,5): |1-5| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7

(2,4)-(4,4): 2

(2,4)-(5,5): |2-5| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4

(4,4)-(5,5): 2

Plus zeros.

H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9, which seems correct.

Similarly, for n=6:

Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

Distances:

(1,1)-(1,2): 1

(1,1)-(2,4): 4

(1,1)-(4,4): 6

(1,1)-(5,5): 8

(1,1)-(6,6): 10

(1,2)-(2,4): 3

(1,2)-(4,4): 5

(1,2)-(5,5): 7

(1,2)-(6,6): 9

(2,4)-(4,4): 2

(2,4)-(5,5): 4

(2,4)-(6,6): 6

(4,4)-(5,5): 2

(4,4)-(6,6): 4

(5,5)-(6,6): 2

Plus zeros.

H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, size 11.

So, it seems like this arrangement is achieving H of size 2n-1 for n >=2.

For n=2: 3, but in their example, it's 2.

Wait, no, for n=2, H has size 2.

Wait, but 2n-1 for n=2 is 3, but in reality, for n=2, H can have at most size 2.

Wait, perhaps for n=2, it's an exception.

But in general, for n >=3, H can have size 2n-1.

Wait, but for n=3, H has size 4, which is less than 2*3 -1=5.

Wait, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, for n=3, 2n-1=5, but in their example, H has size 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify for n=3.

Wait, perhaps for n=3, H can have size 5.

Let me try arranging points to achieve H of size 5.

Suppose points: (1,1), (2,3), (3,2)

Distances:

(1,1)-(2,3): 3

(1,1)-(3,2): 4

(2,3)-(3,2): 2

Plus zeros.

H = {0,2,3,4}, size 4.

Same as before.

Another arrangement: (1,1), (1,3), (3,3)

Distances:

(1,1)-(1,3): 2

(1,1)-(3,3): 4

(1,3)-(3,3): 2

Plus zeros.

H = {0,2,4}, size 3.

Not better.

Another arrangement: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

Distances:

(1,1)-(2,2): 2

(1,1)-(3,3): 4

(2,2)-(3,3): 2

Plus zeros.

H = {0,2,4}, size 3.

Same.

Another arrangement: (1,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances:

(1,1)-(2,3): 3

(1,1)-(3,1): 2

(2,3)-(3,1): 3

Plus zeros.

H = {0,2,3}, size 3.

Still not 5.

Wait, perhaps H=5 is not achievable for n=3.

So, for n=3, H can have at most size 4.

Hence, the general formula of 2n-1 might not hold for all n.

Alternatively, perhaps for n >=2, H_max = 2n -1 for n >=3, but for n=2, it's 2.

Wait, but for n=2, H_max=2, for n=3, H_max=4, for n=4, H_max=7, for n=5, H_max=9, for n=6, H_max=11.

Wait, 2,4,7,9,11.

This doesn't fit any simple formula.

Wait, perhaps for n >=3, H_max=2n-1, but for n=2, it's 2.

So, in the program, for n=2, output two points: (1,1) and (1,2), H={0,1}, size 2.

For n=3, output (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), H={0,1,2,3}, size 4.

For n=4, output (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7.

For n=5, output (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9.

For n=6, output (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, size 11.

So, for n=2, H_size=2

n=3, H_size=4

n=4, H_size=7

n=5, H_size=9

n=6, H_size=11

Looking at this sequence: 2,4,7,9,11.

It's not immediately clear what the formula is.

But for n >=3, it seems H_size=2n-1.

For n=3: 5, but in their example, it's 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for n=2, H_size=2, and for n >=3, H_size=2n-1.

But in n=3, their example has H_size=4, which is less than 2*3-1=5.

Wait, perhaps their example is not optimal.

But according to my earlier attempts, for n=3, I couldn't get H_size=5.

So, perhaps H_max=4 for n=3.

Similarly, for n=4, H_max=7, which is 2*4-1=7.

For n=5, H_max=9, which is 2*5-1=9.

For n=6, H_max=11, which is 2*6-1=11.

Hence, perhaps for n=3, the maximum H_size is 5, but in their example, it's 4.

Maybe their example is not optimal for n=3.

But in the problem statement, they say "one of the possible arrangements", not necessarily the optimal one.

Wait, in the note, for n=3, they have points (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), giving H={0,1,2,3}, size 4.

But perhaps there's a better arrangement for n=3 with H_size=5.

Wait, let's try points (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

Distances: 0,2,4

H_size=3

Not better.

Another arrangement: (1,1), (2,3), (3,5)

Wait, n=3, so y can only be up to 3.

So, (1,1), (2,3), (3,2)

Distances: 0,2,3

H_size=3

Still not better.

Wait, perhaps H_max=4 for n=3.

Hence, in the program, for n=3, output three points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), giving H={0,1,2,3}, size 4.

Which seems to be the maximum for n=3.

Similarly, for n=4, H_max=7, which matches the program's output.

Hence, perhaps the general strategy in the program is:

- For n=2: output (1,1) and (1,2)

- For n=3: output (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- For n>=4: output (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and for j from 4 to n, output (j,j)

This seems to achieve H_size=2n-1 for n>=3, and H_size=2 for n=2.

But for n=3, it's giving H_size=4, which is less than 2*3-1=5.

Wait, perhaps for n=3, it's a special case.

Alternatively, perhaps the general formula is H_max=2n-1 for n>=2, but in practice, for n=3, it's only possible to achieve H_size=4.

But in the program, for n=3, it outputs three points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), giving H={0,1,2,3}, size 4.

But according to 2n-1, for n=3, it should be 5.

However, perhaps in reality, for n=3, it's impossible to achieve H_size=5.

Hence, perhaps the general formula is H_max=2n-1 for n>=4, and H_max=2 for n=2, H_max=4 for n=3.

Alternatively, perhaps H_max=2n-1 - something.

But this is getting too complicated.

Given that, perhaps the program's approach is acceptable, as it achieves H_size=4 for n=3, which matches their example.

For n=2, H_size=2, which is maximum.

For n=4, H_size=7, which seems maximum.

For n=5, H_size=9, which seems maximum.

Hence, perhaps the program is correct.

But I need to verify for general n.

Looking at the program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

print('1 1')

print('1 2')

if n == 3:

print('2 3')

else:

print('2 4')

for j in range(4, n + 1):

print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



So, for n>=4, after outputting (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), it outputs (4,4), (5,5), ..., (n,n).

This seems to cover a range of distances.

From the earlier calculations, for n=4, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which is 7, matching 2*4-1=7.

Similarly, for n=5, H={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9, matching 2*5-1=9.

Hence, for n>=4, H_size=2n-1.

For n=3, H_size=4, which is less than 2*3-1=5.

Hence, perhaps for n=3, it's impossible to achieve H_size=5, and 4 is the maximum.

Hence, the program seems to be correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
