Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp lost his string, which is made up of lowercase Latin letters, but he has something called a "trace" of the string. The trace is an array of integers that correspond to the original string in a specific way. Specifically, for each position i in the string, a_i is the number of indices j (where j < i) such that s_i equals s_j. That means a_i tells us how many times the character s_i has appeared before position i.

For example, in the string "abracadabra", the trace is [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]. Let's see why:

- The first 'a' has no previous 'a's, so 0.

- The first 'b' has no previous 'b's, so 0.

- The first 'r' has no previous 'r's, so 0.

- The second 'a' has one previous 'a', so 1.

- And so on.

Given this trace, I need to reconstruct any string that could have produced this trace. The problem assures me that a valid string exists for the given trace.

First, I need to understand the input and output formats. The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n, the length of the string, followed by a list of n integers representing the trace. The output should be one string per test case that corresponds to the given trace.

Constraints:

- Number of test cases t is up to 10^4.

- Length of the string n can be up to 2*10^5.

- Sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

Given these constraints, efficiency is important, especially since t can be up to 10^4, but the total sum of n is manageable at 2*10^5.

Now, thinking about how to approach this problem.

I need to generate a string where for each position i, the number of previous characters that are the same as the current one matches a_i.

One way to think about this is to keep track of the frequency of each character up to each position and use that to determine which character to place next.

Wait, but I have the frequency information already in the trace array. So, for each position i, a_i tells me how many times the character at s_i has appeared before.

I need to assign characters to positions in such a way that this condition is satisfied.

An important observation is that different characters can have their own frequency counts independently. For example, the count for 'a's is separate from the count for 'b's, and so on.

So, perhaps I can maintain a frequency count for each character and, for each position, choose a character that matches the required a_i.

But how do I choose which character to assign to position i?

I need to pick a character that has appeared exactly a_i times before position i.

Since there are multiple characters, I need to keep track of the frequency of each character separately.

Let me consider initializing an array or list to keep track of the frequency of each lowercase letter. Since there are 26 lowercase letters, I can have a list of size 26, each element representing the frequency of a particular letter.

For example, b = [0, 0, ..., 0] # 26 zeros, one for each letter a to z.

Then, for each position i from 0 to n-1:

- I need to choose a letter whose current frequency matches a_i.

- Once I choose that letter, I append it to the result string and increment its frequency.

This seems plausible.

Let's try this approach with the first example:

n = 11

a = [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]

Initialize b = [0,0,0,...,0] # 26 zeros.

Initialize result = ""

For i=0:

a[0] = 0

I need to choose a letter that has frequency 0 so far. Any letter that hasn't been used yet.

I can choose 'a' (since b[0] = 0).

Set result = "a"

Increment b['a'] to 1.

For i=1:

a[1] = 0

Again, choose a letter with frequency 0 so far. 'b' hasn't been used yet.

Set result = "ab"

Increment b['b'] to 1.

For i=2:

a[2] = 0

Choose a letter with frequency 0. 'r' hasn't been used yet.

Set result = "abr"

Increment b['r'] to 1.

For i=3:

a[3] = 1

I need a letter that has appeared once before. 'a' has frequency 1.

Set result = "abra"

Increment b['a'] to 2.

For i=4:

a[4] = 0

Choose a letter with frequency 0. 'c' hasn't been used yet.

Set result = "abrac"

Increment b['c'] to 1.

For i=5:

a[5] = 2

I need a letter that has appeared twice before. 'a' has frequency 2.

Set result = "abracad"

Increment b['a'] to 3.

For i=6:

a[6] = 0

Choose a letter with frequency 0. 'd' hasn't been used yet.

Set result = "abracad"

Wait, 'd' has already been used in position 4? Wait, in the previous step, I used 'a' for position 5, which incremented b['a'] to 3.

Wait, position 4: 'c' was used, b['c'] is 1.

Position 5: 'a' was used, b['a'] is 3.

Position 6: I need a letter with frequency 0. But 'd' has already been used in position 4.

Wait, in the example, position 7 is 'a' with a frequency of 3, which matches.

Wait, maybe I need to choose a letter that has frequency exactly a_i.

In position 6, a[6] = 0, so I need a letter that has not been used yet.

In the example, position 7 is 'a' with a[7] = 3, which matches b['a'] = 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the letter whose current frequency matches a_i.

But in position 6, a[6] = 0, so I need a letter with frequency 0.

In the example, position 6 is 'd' with a[6] = 0, but 'd' has been used before in position 4.

Wait, in the trace, a_i is the number of times s_i has appeared before position i.

In the example, s[6] = 'd', and a[6] = 0, meaning 'd' has not appeared before position 6.

But in reality, 'd' appeared at position 4.

This seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, in the example, the trace is [0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4], and the string is "abracadabra".

Let's map it:

Positions:

0: 'a', a[0]=0 (no previous 'a')

1: 'b', a[1]=0 (no previous 'b')

2: 'r', a[2]=0 (no previous 'r')

3: 'a', a[3]=1 (one previous 'a')

4: 'c', a[4]=0 (no previous 'c')

5: 'a', a[5]=2 (two previous 'a's)

6: 'd', a[6]=0 (no previous 'd')

7: 'a', a[7]=3 (three previous 'a's)

8: 'b', a[8]=1 (one previous 'b')

9: 'r', a[9]=1 (one previous 'r')

10: 'a', a[10]=4 (four previous 'a's)

Wait, but in position 6, 'd' has a[6]=0, meaning no previous 'd's, but 'd' appears at position 6, which is consistent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, in my earlier attempt:

For i=6:

a[6]=0

I need to choose a letter that has frequency 0 so far.

In the example, 'd' has frequency 1 up to position 6, but a[6]=0 suggests that the character at position 6 has not appeared before.

Wait, but in the example, 'd' appears at position 6 for the first time.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the frequency.

Wait, b is the frequency array.

Wait, maybe I need to choose the letter that has frequency a_i up to the previous position.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the letter for which the number of times it has appeared before is a_i.

In other words, for position i, s_i is a character that has appeared a_i times before position i.

So, to reconstruct the string, for each position i, I need to choose a character that has appeared exactly a_i times in the string up to position i-1.

Given that, I can maintain a frequency array for each character.

Then, for each position i:

- I look for a character whose frequency is equal to a_i.

- Assign that character to position i.

- Increment its frequency.

This seems correct.

In the example:

Initialize b = [0,0,0,...,0]

i=0, a[0]=0: choose a character with frequency 0, say 'a', set b['a']=1, result="a"

i=1, a[1]=0: choose a character with frequency 0, 'b', set b['b']=1, result="ab"

i=2, a[2]=0: choose 'r', set b['r']=1, result="abr"

i=3, a[3]=1: choose a character with frequency 1, 'a', set b['a']=2, result="abra"

i=4, a[4]=0: choose 'c', set b['c']=1, result="abrac"

i=5, a[5]=2: choose 'a' with frequency 2, set b['a']=3, result="abracad"

i=6, a[6]=0: choose 'd', set b['d']=1, result="abracad"

Wait, in the example, position 6 is 'd' with a[6]=0, but in "abracad", 'd' has already appeared at position 4, so its frequency is 1, but a[6]=0 suggests it should be the first occurrence.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe a_i is the number of times s_i has appeared before position i.

So, for position i, a_i is the number of times the character at s_i has appeared in positions 0 to i-1.

So, when choosing s_i, I need to select a character that has appeared exactly a_i times in the previous positions.

Hence, for each position i:

- Look for a character c such that the frequency of c in s[0..i-1] is a_i.

- Assign c to s_i.

- Increment the frequency of c.

This seems correct.

In the example:

i=0, a[0]=0: choose a character that has appeared 0 times before, i.e., a new character, 'a', set frequency of 'a' to 1.

i=1, a[1]=0: choose a new character 'b', set frequency of 'b' to 1.

i=2, a[2]=0: choose a new character 'r', set frequency of 'r' to 1.

i=3, a[3]=1: choose a character that has appeared once before, 'a', set frequency of 'a' to 2.

i=4, a[4]=0: choose a new character 'c', set frequency of 'c' to 1.

i=5, a[5]=2: choose 'a' which has appeared twice before, set frequency of 'a' to 3.

i=6, a[6]=0: choose a new character 'd', set frequency of 'd' to 1.

i=7, a[7]=3: choose 'a' which has appeared three times before, set frequency of 'a' to 4.

i=8, a[8]=1: choose 'b' which has appeared once before, set frequency of 'b' to 2.

i=9, a[9]=1: choose 'r' which has appeared once before, set frequency of 'r' to 2.

i=10, a[10]=4: choose 'a' which has appeared four times before, set frequency of 'a' to 5.

This matches the example string "abracadabra".

So, the approach seems valid.

Now, to implement this, I need to keep track of the frequency of each character.

I can use a list of size 26, each index representing a character from 'a' to 'z'.

Initialize this list to [0,0,0,...,0]

For each position i from 0 to n-1:

- I need to find a character c such that b[ord(c)-ord('a')] == a[i]

- Assign c to s_i

- Increment b[ord(c)-ord('a')]

Since there are multiple characters, and I need to choose any character that satisfies the condition, I can iterate through the 26 letters and pick the first one that matches the required frequency.

If multiple letters have the same frequency, it doesn't matter which one I choose, as long as their frequency matches a_i.

The problem states that a valid string exists for the given trace, so I don't need to worry about cases where no character satisfies the condition.

Let's try this with another example.

Take n=5, a=[0,0,0,0,0]

This means that each character has not appeared before its position.

So, I can choose all unique characters: "abcde"

Another example: n=3, a=[0,1,1]

- i=0, a[0]=0: choose 'a', b['a']=1, s="a"

- i=1, a[1]=1: choose 'a', b['a']=2, s="aa"

- i=2, a[2]=1: choose 'a', b['a']=3, s="aaa"

So, the string is "aaa".

Another example: n=4, a=[0,1,0,1]

- i=0, a[0]=0: choose 'a', b['a']=1, s="a"

- i=1, a[1]=1: choose 'a', b['a']=2, s="aa"

- i=2, a[2]=0: choose 'b', b['b']=1, s="aab"

- i=3, a[3]=1: choose 'a', b['a']=3, s="aaba"

So, the string is "aaba".

This seems consistent.

Now, considering the implementation.

I need to read t test cases, each with n and a list of n integers.

For each test case, I need to output a string that corresponds to the given trace.

Given that t can be up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient solution.

Time complexity should be acceptable since for each position, I'm iterating through 26 letters to find the first one that matches the required frequency.

This should be O(n*26), which is acceptable given n<=2*10^5.

Space-wise, I need to store the frequency array for each test case, but since it's per test case, and n is up to 2*10^5, it should be fine.

Now, looking at the given program.

def func():

a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for t in range(int(input())):

b = [0] * 26

n = int(input())

s = list(map(int, input().split()))

r = ''

for i in s:

x = b.index(i)

r += a[x]

b[x] += 1

print(r)

This seems to follow the approach I described.

- It initializes a frequency array b = [0,0,0,...,0]

- For each test case, it reads n and the list s.

- Then, for each a_i in s:

- Finds the index x in b where b[x] == a_i

- Appends the corresponding character a[x] to the result string r

- Increments b[x] by 1

- Finally, prints the result string.

This should work correctly, as it matches the logic I outlined.

However, there is a potential issue with the use of b.index(i). The index() method returns the first index where the value is found. So, it will always pick the first character that matches the required frequency.

Given that there might be multiple characters with the same frequency, this approach will consistently choose the one that appears first in the alphabet.

But since the problem allows any valid string, this should be acceptable.

Let me verify with an example.

Take n=5, a=[0,0,0,0,0]

- b = [0,0,0,...,0]

- i=0, a_i=0: x = b.index(0) = 0, choose 'a', b=[1,0,0,...]

- i=1, a_i=0: x = b.index(0) = 1, choose 'b', b=[1,1,0,...]

- i=2, a_i=0: x = b.index(0) = 2, choose 'c', b=[1,1,1,...]

- i=3, a_i=0: x = b.index(0) = 3, choose 'd', b=[1,1,1,1,...]

- i=4, a_i=0: x = b.index(0) = 4, choose 'e', b=[1,1,1,1,1,...]

- Result: "abcde" which is correct.

Another example: n=3, a=[0,1,1]

- b = [0,0,0,...]

- i=0, a_i=0: x=0, choose 'a', b=[1,0,0,...]

- i=1, a_i=1: x=0, choose 'a', b=[2,0,0,...]

- i=2, a_i=1: x=0, choose 'a', b=[3,0,0,...]

- Result: "aaa" which is correct.

Another example: n=4, a=[0,1,0,1]

- b = [0,0,0,...]

- i=0, a_i=0: x=0, choose 'a', b=[1,0,0,...]

- i=1, a_i=1: x=0, choose 'a', b=[2,0,0,...]

- i=2, a_i=0: x=1, choose 'b', b=[2,1,0,...]

- i=3, a_i=1: x=0, choose 'a', b=[3,1,0,...]

- Result: "aaba" which is correct.

Seems like this approach works.

Is there any edge case where this might fail?

Consider n=1, a=[0]

- b = [0,0,0,...]

- i=0, a_i=0: x=0, choose 'a', b=[1,0,0,...]

- Result: "a" which is correct.

Another edge case: n=8, a=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

- b = [0,0,0,...]

- i=0, a_i=0: x=0, choose 'a', b=[1,0,0,...]

- i=1, a_i=1: x=0, choose 'a', b=[2,0,0,...]

- i=2, a_i=2: x=0, choose 'a', b=[3,0,0,...]

- i=3, a_i=3: x=0, choose 'a', b=[4,0,0,...]

- i=4, a_i=4: x=0, choose 'a', b=[5,0,0,...]

- i=5, a_i=5: x=0, choose 'a', b=[6,0,0,...]

- i=6, a_i=6: x=0, choose 'a', b=[7,0,0,...]

- i=7, a_i=7: x=0, choose 'a', b=[8,0,0,...]

- Result: "aaaaaaa" which seems correct, but according to the example output, it should be "aaaaaaaa".

Wait, the example output for n=8, a=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is "aaaaaaaa", which matches this.

Another test case: n=8, a=[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]

Wait, in the sample input, it's n=10, a=[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0], and the output is "codeforces".

But according to this approach:

- b = [0,0,0,...]

- i=0, a_i=0: x=0, choose 'a', b=[1,0,0,...]

- i=1, a_i=0: x=1, choose 'b', b=[1,1,0,...]

- i=2, a_i=0: x=2, choose 'c', b=[1,1,1,...]

- i=3, a_i=0: x=3, choose 'd', b=[1,1,1,1,...]

- i=4, a_i=0: x=4, choose 'e', b=[1,1,1,1,1,...]

- i=5, a_i=1: x=0, choose 'a', b=[2,1,1,1,1,...]

- i=6, a_i=0: x=5, choose 'f', b=[2,1,1,1,1,1,...]

- i=7, a_i=1: x=1, choose 'b', b=[2,2,1,1,1,1,...]

- i=8, a_i=1: x=0, choose 'a', b=[3,2,1,1,1,1,...]

- i=9, a_i=0: x=6, choose 'g', b=[3,2,1,1,1,1,1,...]

- Result: "abcdeafbag"

But the sample output for this input is "codeforces", which is different.

However, the problem allows any valid string, so "abcdeafbag" is also valid as long as it matches the trace.

But the sample output is "codeforces", which is probably the original string that produced the trace.

But since the problem allows any valid string, both are acceptable.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Is there any case where b.index(i) might not find the required frequency?

The problem states that a valid string exists for the given trace, so there will always be at least one character with the required frequency.

Hence, b.index(i) will always find such a character.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
