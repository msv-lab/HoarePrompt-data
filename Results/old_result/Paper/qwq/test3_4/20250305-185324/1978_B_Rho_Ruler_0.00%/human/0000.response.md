Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. Bob has baked n buns, and he wants to sell them. Normally, each bun is sold for a coins. But to attract customers, he's offering a promotion where he can choose some integer k (between 0 and the minimum of n and b) and sell the first k buns at a modified price. The price for the i-th bun (where i ranges from 1 to k) is (b - i + 1) coins. The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price of a coins each.

My task is to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns, choosing the best k for this promotion.

First, I need to make sure I understand the promotion correctly. If Bob chooses k = 0, he sells all n buns at the usual price a coins each, so the total profit is n * a.

If he chooses k = 1, he sells the first bun for b coins and the remaining (n - 1) buns at a coins each. Total profit would be b + (n - 1) * a.

If he chooses k = 2, the first bun is sold for b coins, the second for (b - 1) coins, and the remaining (n - 2) buns at a coins each. Total profit is b + (b - 1) + (n - 2) * a.

And so on, up to k = min(n, b), where he sells k buns with decreasing prices starting from b down to (b - k + 1), and the remaining (n - k) buns at a coins each.

The goal is to maximize the total profit by choosing the optimal k.

I need to consider different values of k and calculate the total profit for each, then select the maximum.

But since n, a, and b can be up to 10^9, I need an efficient way to do this without iterating through all possible k values, which could be up to 10^9.

So, I need to find a smarter way to determine the best k.

Let me think about the total profit as a function of k.

Total profit P(k) = sum of prices of the first k buns + (n - k) * a

The sum of the first k buns' prices is the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is b and the last term is (b - k + 1).

The sum of the first k terms of an arithmetic series is k * (first term + last term) / 2.

So, sum = k * (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 = k * (2b - k + 1) / 2

Therefore, P(k) = [k * (2b - k + 1) / 2] + (n - k) * a

I need to maximize P(k) over k from 0 to min(n, b).

This looks like a quadratic function in terms of k.

Let me write P(k) in terms of k:

P(k) = (2b*k - k^2 + k)/2 + (n - k)*a

Simplify:

P(k) = (2b*k)/2 - k^2/2 + k/2 + n*a - k*a

P(k) = b*k - k^2/2 + k/2 + n*a - k*a

Combine like terms:

P(k) = (-1/2)*k^2 + (b + 1/2 - a)*k + n*a

This is a quadratic equation in k: P(k) = A*k^2 + B*k + C, where

A = -1/2

B = b + 0.5 - a

C = n*a

Since A is negative, this quadratic opens downwards, meaning it has a maximum at its vertex.

The vertex of a parabola occurs at k = -B/(2*A)

Plugging in the values:

k = -(b + 0.5 - a)/(2*(-1/2)) = (a - b - 0.5)/(-1) = b + 0.5 - a

So, k = b + 0.5 - a

But k has to be an integer between 0 and min(n, b).

Also, since k must be an integer, I need to consider the integer values around this vertex.

But I need to ensure that this k is within the allowed range.

Wait, but k must be an integer between 0 and min(n, b), inclusive.

So, the optimal k should be the integer closest to the vertex, within the bounds.

But since A is negative, the maximum occurs at the vertex, and since it's a discrete problem, I should check the floor and ceil of the vertex's k and see which one gives the higher P(k).

But considering the large constraints, I need a O(1) solution if possible.

Alternatively, since it's a quadratic with A < 0, it's concave, so I can perform a binary search over k to find the maximum P(k).

Given that t can be up to 10^4 and n, b up to 10^9, a binary search per test case might be acceptable, as long as the binary search is efficient.

But ideally, I'd like an O(1) solution.

Let me think differently.

Another approach is to compare the sum of the modified prices for k buns with the sum of the usual prices for k buns, and see when it's beneficial to include another bun in the promotion.

In other words, for each k, calculate the difference between P(k) and P(k-1), and see when this difference becomes non-positive.

But perhaps it's better to compute the total profit for k buns using the modified prices and compare it to selling all at the usual price.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the total profit for k buns using the modified prices and then add the profit from the remaining (n - k) buns at the usual price.

I already have the formula for P(k):

P(k) = [k*(2b - k + 1)/2] + (n - k)*a

I need to maximize P(k) for k from 0 to min(n, b).

Given that it's a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, it's concave, and I can find the k that maximizes it.

Alternatively, I can iterate k from 0 to min(n, b) and find the maximum P(k).

But with n and b up to 10^9, iterating is not feasible.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the difference between P(k) and P(k-1):

Delta(k) = P(k) - P(k-1)

= [k*(2b - k + 1)/2 + (n - k)*a] - [(k-1)*(2b - (k-1) + 1)/2 + (n - (k-1))*a]

Simplify this:

Delta(k) = [k*(2b - k + 1)/2 + (n - k)*a] - [(k-1)*(2b - k + 2)/2 + (n - k + 1)*a]

Let me compute this step by step.

First, expand k*(2b - k + 1)/2:

= (2b*k - k^2 + k)/2

Similarly, (k-1)*(2b - k + 2)/2:

= (2b*(k-1) - (k-1)^2 + (k-1))/2

= (2b*k - 2b - k^2 + 2k - 1)/2

And (n - k)*a = n*a - k*a

And (n - k + 1)*a = n*a - (k - 1)*a

Now, plug these back into Delta(k):

Delta(k) = [(2b*k - k^2 + k)/2 + n*a - k*a] - [(2b*k - 2b - k^2 + 2k - 1)/2 + n*a - (k - 1)*a]

Simplify:

= (2b*k - k^2 + k)/2 + n*a - k*a - (2b*k - 2b - k^2 + 2k - 1)/2 - n*a + (k - 1)*a

= [(2b*k - k^2 + k) - (2b*k - 2b - k^2 + 2k - 1)]/2 + n*a - k*a - n*a + (k - 1)*a

= [2b*k - k^2 + k - 2b*k + 2b + k^2 - 2k + 1]/2 + (-k*a + (k - 1)*a)

= [2b - k + 1]/2 + (k - k - 1)*a

= (2b - k + 1)/2 - a

So, Delta(k) = (2b - k + 1)/2 - a

We can set Delta(k) >= 0 to find when P(k) >= P(k-1), meaning that increasing k is beneficial.

Set Delta(k) >= 0:

(2b - k + 1)/2 - a >= 0

Multiply both sides by 2:

2b - k + 1 - 2a >= 0

Rearrange:

-k >= 2a - 2b - 1

Multiply both sides by -1 (and reverse inequality):

k <= 2b + 1 - 2a

So, as long as k <= 2b + 1 - 2a, increasing k is beneficial.

But k has to be between 0 and min(n, b).

So, the optimal k is the minimum of floor((2b + 1 - 2a)/1) and min(n, b).

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, from k <= 2b + 1 - 2a, but k has to be integer, so I can take k_max = floor((2b + 1 - 2a)/1), but need to ensure it's within [0, min(n, b)].

Wait, but 2b + 1 - 2a might be negative, zero, or positive.

If 2b + 1 - 2a >= 0, then k_max = floor(2b + 1 - 2a)

Else, k_max = 0

But this seems not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that as k increases, P(k) increases as long as Delta(k) > 0, and starts decreasing when Delta(k) < 0.

Hence, the maximum P(k) occurs at the largest k where Delta(k) >= 0.

So, I can find the largest k such that (2b - k + 1)/2 - a >= 0

Which simplifies to k <= 2b + 1 - 2a

But k has to be between 0 and min(n, b)

Hence, the optimal k is min(min(n, b), max(0, 2b + 1 - 2a))

Wait, but 2b + 1 - 2a could be negative, so I need to take max(0, 2b + 1 - 2a)

Then, optimal k is min(min(n, b), max(0, 2b + 1 - 2a))

But I need to verify this.

Wait, perhaps it's better to perform a binary search over k to find the maximum P(k).

Given that t can be up to 10^4 and n, b up to 10^9, a binary search per test case should work efficiently.

I can implement a binary search over k from 0 to min(n, b), and find the k that maximizes P(k).

To implement binary search, I need a way to decide whether to go left or right based on some condition.

Given that P(k) is a concave function (since A < 0), I can find the point where P(k) >= P(k+1), indicating the peak.

Wait, actually, to find the maximum, I can find the largest k where P(k) >= P(k+1)

Because beyond that point, P(k) starts decreasing.

So, I can define a function that checks if P(k) >= P(k+1), and use binary search to find the largest k satisfying this condition.

Hence, the condition for a given k is P(k) >= P(k+1)

Which is equivalent to Delta(k+1) <= 0

From earlier, Delta(k) = (2b - k + 1)/2 - a

So, Delta(k+1) = (2b - (k+1) + 1)/2 - a = (2b - k - 1 + 1)/2 - a = (2b - k)/2 - a

Set Delta(k+1) <= 0:

(2b - k)/2 - a <= 0

Multiply both sides by 2:

2b - k - 2a <= 0

Rearrange:

k >= 2b - 2a

So, for k >= 2b - 2a, P(k) >= P(k+1)

Hence, the maximum P(k) occurs at the largest k where k <= 2b - 2a

But wait, this seems inconsistent with earlier steps.

I need to reconcile this.

Wait, perhaps it's better to stick with the binary search approach.

Implement a binary search over k from 0 to min(n, b), and for each mid, check if P(mid) >= P(mid + 1). If yes, then mid could be the answer, and I can look for a higher k in the right half. Else, search in the left half.

Wait, but in standard binary search for maximum, I need to find the last k where P(k) >= P(k+1).

Hence, the condition for high = mid - 1 when P(mid) >= P(mid + 1), and low = mid + 1 otherwise.

Finally, ans = mid

Wait, no.

Actually, in binary search for the last k satisfying a condition, I set high = mid - 1 when the condition is met, and low = mid + 1 otherwise.

At the end, ans = high if the condition is met at high, else low.

Wait, but in this case, I need to find the largest k where P(k) >= P(k+1).

Hence, the condition is P(k) >= P(k+1)

So, in the binary search:

- If P(mid) >= P(mid + 1), then the maximum is at mid or to the left. So, set high = mid - 1

- Else, set low = mid + 1

After the loop, the maximum is at low (since low will be the smallest k where P(k) < P(k+1)), but I need to check P(low) and P(low - 1)

Wait, actually, to get the last k where P(k) >= P(k+1), I should set:

- If P(mid) >= P(mid + 1), set high = mid - 1

- Else, set low = mid + 1

After the loop, the maximum is at low - 1, because at low, P(low) < P(low + 1), which is not desired.

Hence, ans = low - 1

But I need to handle edge cases carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's better to implement this carefully.

Let me think about the implementation.

Define a function that calculates P(k):

P(k) = sum of first k buns at modified prices + (n - k) * a

Sum of first k buns at modified prices is k*(2b - k + 1)/2

Hence, P(k) = k*(2b - k + 1)/2 + (n - k)*a

I need to implement this efficiently, considering that n, a, b can be up to 1e9, so I need to handle large integers properly.

Also, t can be up to 1e4, so the solution should be efficient per test case.

Implementing binary search for each test case should be acceptable.

Now, in the given code, there's a function func_1(k, a, b, n) that seems to calculate something related to P(k), but it's not clear.

Wait, in the given code:

def func_1(k, a, b, n):

    ans = 0

    ans += k * b

    ans += (n - k) * a

    return ans <= n * max(a, b)

This seems incorrect because it's calculating ans = k*b + (n - k)*a, which is not the correct formula for P(k). The correct formula is P(k) = k*(2b - k + 1)/2 + (n - k)*a

Hence, this func_1 is incorrect.

Moreover, the binary search is trying to find the largest k where P(k) <= n * max(a, b), which doesn't make sense for maximizing profit.

The goal is to maximize P(k), not to find where P(k) <= some value.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to maximize Bob's profit from selling his buns under the given promotion. The promotion allows Bob to choose an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)), where the first k buns are sold at a modified price decreasing from b to (b - k + 1) coins, and the remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price of a coins each.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Profit Function**:
    - The profit function P(k) is given by:
      \\[ P(k) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) \right) + a \times (n - k) \\]
    - This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
      \\[ \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2} \\]
    - Therefore:
      \\[ P(k) = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - k) \\]

2. **Optimal k Selection**:
    - To maximize P(k), we need to find the value of k within the range [0, min(n, b)] that gives the highest profit.
    - Since P(k) is a quadratic function in terms of k with a negative leading coefficient, it has a single peak, making it suitable for a binary search approach.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**:
    - We perform a binary search over k from 0 to min(n, b).
    - In each step, we calculate P(k) and P(k+1) to decide the direction of the search:
        - If P(k) >= P(k+1), we search the left half.
        - Otherwise, we search the right half.
    - The search ends when low > high, and the optimal k is at low - 1.

### Solution Code

```python
def P(k, a, b, n):
    if k < 0 or k > min(n, b):
        return 0
    sum_modified = k * (2 * b - k + 1) // 2
    sum_regular = (n - k) * a
    return sum_modified + sum_regular

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        a = int(data[index + 1])
        b = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        low = 0
        high = min(n, b)
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if P(mid, a, b, n) >= P(mid + 1, a, b, n):
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        max_profit = P(low, a, b, n)
        print(max_profit)
```

### Explanation

1. **Profit Calculation**:
    - The function `P(k, a, b, n)` calculates the profit for a given k using the formula derived from the sum of the arithmetic series for the modified prices plus the profit from the regular prices.

2. **Binary Search**:
    - We initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to min(n, b).
    - In each iteration, we calculate the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
    - If `P(mid) >= P(mid + 1)`, it means we've passed the peak, so we adjust `high` to `mid - 1`.
    - Otherwise, we adjust `low` to `mid + 1`.
    - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`, and the optimal k is `low - 1`.

3. **Output**:
    - For each test case, we compute and print the maximum profit using the optimal k found by the binary search.
