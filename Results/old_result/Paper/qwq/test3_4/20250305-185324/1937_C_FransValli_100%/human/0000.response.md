Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's an interactive problem, which means I need to communicate with some kind of judge or interactor to get information and provide answers. The goal is to find a pair of indices in a secret permutation that maximizes their bitwise XOR value. I can ask up to 3n queries per test case, and I need to do this for multiple test cases.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} means that the sequence contains each number from 0 to n-1 exactly once, but in some shuffled order. So, for example, if n=3, possible permutations are [0,1,2], [0,2,1], [1,0,2], etc.

The task is to find any two indices i and j (0 ≤ i,j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, where ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operation. XOR compares the binary representations of two numbers and outputs a number that has 1s in positions where the bits differ and 0s where they are the same.

So, to maximize p_i ⊕ p_j, I need to find two numbers in the permutation whose XOR is as large as possible.

Now, the tricky part is that I don't know the actual values of the permutation p. I can only ask queries about comparisons between OR operations of four indices I choose: a, b, c, d. Specifically, I ask "? a b c d", and I get back whether (p_a | p_b) is less than, equal to, or greater than (p_c | p_d).

OR operation (|) between two numbers is a bitwise operation that returns 1 in each bit position where either of the numbers has a 1.

So, with these queries, I need to gather information about the values in the permutation to find the pair with the maximum XOR.

First, I need to think about how to use these queries effectively to learn about the permutation.

One approach could be to try to identify the maximum and minimum values in the permutation, since the maximum XOR might involve the maximum and minimum values.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, in the sequence [0,1,2,3], the maximum XOR is between 1 and 2, which is 3, not between 0 and 3, which is 3, same thing in this case, but in general, it might not always be between the min and max.

Actually, in binary terms, to maximize XOR, you want the numbers to differ in the most significant bits possible.

So, perhaps I need to find two numbers that differ in the highest possible bit position.

But how can I do that with the given queries?

Let me consider the properties of OR and XOR.

OR combines the bits, setting a bit to 1 if either number has it set.

XOR sets a bit to 1 only if the bits differ.

So, they are different operations, and relating them might be tricky.

I need to find a way to use comparisons of OR operations to infer something about the XOR values.

One idea is to try to determine the relative magnitudes of the p_i values. Since OR of two numbers is related to their magnitudes, comparing ORs can give some information about the relative sizes of the numbers involved.

But OR doesn't give a complete ordering, since two different pairs can have the same OR value.

Still, perhaps I can use a series of queries to identify the largest and second largest numbers, or something like that.

Looking back at the example provided:

n=4, p=[0,3,1,2]

Queries:

1. ? 0 2 3 1 → < because (0|1)=1 < (2|3)=3

2. ? 1 1 2 3 → = because (3|3)=3 == (1|2)=3

3. ? 1 2 0 3 → > because (3|1)=3 > (0|2)=2

Then, the answer is ! 3 2, since 2 ⊕ 1 = 3, which is the maximum XOR.

So, in this case, by asking about ORs of different pairs, they were able to infer information about the values.

I need to generalize this approach.

Let me think about the properties of OR and XOR.

First, OR is a lower bound on the maximum of the two numbers, since p_a | p_b ≥ max(p_a, p_b).

Wait, no. Actually, p_a | p_b can be larger than both p_a and p_b. For example, 1|2=3, which is larger than both.

But it's true that p_a | p_b ≥ p_a and p_a | p_b ≥ p_b.

So, p_a | p_b is at least as large as both p_a and p_b.

Similarly, p_c | p_d is at least as large as p_c and p_d.

When I compare (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d), I'm comparing the ORs of two pairs.

If (p_a | p_b) > (p_c | p_d), then the maximum of p_a and p_b is likely larger than the maximum of p_c and p_d, but not necessarily, because of the way OR works.

For example, p_a=1, p_b=2 → p_a | p_b=3

p_c=3, p_d=0 → p_c | p_d=3

So, even though p_a and p_b have a maximum of 2, and p_c and p_d have a maximum of 3, their ORs are equal.

So, OR doesn't uniquely determine the maximum, but it gives some information.

Given that, perhaps I can use queries to identify the maximum value in the permutation.

Let me consider trying to find the index with the maximum p_i.

To find the maximum p_i, I can compare ORs of single elements.

Wait, but I need to compare (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d).

So, if I set a=b=some index, and c=d=some other index, then I'm comparing (p_a | p_a) vs (p_c | p_c), which is just p_a vs p_c, since p_a | p_a = p_a.

So, in that case, I'm directly comparing p_a and p_c.

This seems useful for comparing individual elements.

Wait, but in the problem, it says that a, b, c, d are indices, and x = (p_a | p_b), y = (p_c | p_d), and I get whether x < y, x > y, or x == y.

So, if I set a=b=i and c=d=j, then x = p_i and y = p_j, and I get whether p_i < p_j, p_i > p_j, or p_i == p_j.

This effectively allows me to compare any two elements directly.

That's a powerful observation.

So, with this, I can perform comparisons between any two elements as if I knew their actual values.

Given that, I can treat this as if I can compare any two elements directly.

Now, with this in mind, I can think about standard algorithms for finding the maximum or other properties in a list with comparisons.

But I have to be careful with the number of queries. Since n can be up to 10^4 and t up to 10^3, and sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^4, I need an efficient approach.

First, I can find the index with the maximum p_i using n-1 comparisons, just like finding the maximum in a list.

Once I have the index with the maximum p_i, say it's index u, then I can find the index with the second maximum p_i by comparing the remaining elements against each other and against u.

But wait, actually, for XOR, it's not necessarily about finding the maximum and second maximum.

Because, as I thought earlier, the maximum XOR might not be between the maximum and second maximum elements.

For example, in the sequence [0,1,2,3], max is 3, second max is 2, but 3 ⊕ 2 = 1, whereas 1 ⊕ 2 = 3, which is larger.

So, in this case, the maximum XOR is between 1 and 2, not between max and second max.

Hence, finding just the max and second max might not suffice.

I need a better strategy.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

The XOR of two numbers is maximized when they differ in as many high-order bits as possible.

So, if I can find two numbers that have different highest set bits, their XOR would be large.

For example, if one number has the highest bit at position k and the other has it at position k-1 or higher, their XOR would be large.

But in a permutation of 0 to n-1, the numbers range from 0 to n-1, so their binary representations have lengths up to floor(log2(n-1)) + 1 bits.

I need to find two numbers whose XOR is as large as possible.

One way to do this is to consider the binary representations bit by bit, starting from the most significant bit.

I can try to set the highest possible bit in the XOR to 1, then the next highest, and so on.

But to do this, I need to know which bits can be different between two numbers in the permutation.

But since I don't know the actual values, I need to use the queries to gather information.

Wait, but since I can compare any two p_i and p_j directly by setting a=b=i and c=d=j, I can treat this as if I know the complete ordering of the p_i's.

So, perhaps I can sort the p_i's indirectly by performing comparisons.

But sorting would take O(n log n) comparisons, which is too many since I only have 3n queries per test case.

Given that, I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that I can find the maximum p_i with n-1 comparisons, then find the second maximum with n-2 comparisons, and so on.

But again, this would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the two p_i's that are farthest apart in terms of their values.

Since XOR is related to the differences in their binary representations, the pair with the largest difference in their values would likely have a large XOR.

But is this always true?

Not necessarily, because two numbers can be far apart but have many overlapping bits.

For example, 7 and 3 are far apart (7=111, 3=011), but their XOR is 4 (100), whereas 7 ⊕ 2 = 5 (101), which is larger.

Wait, actually, 7 ⊕ 3 = 4 (100), 7 ⊕ 2 = 5 (101), 7 ⊕ 1 = 6 (110), 7 ⊕ 0 = 7 (111), etc.

So, in this case, the maximum XOR is between 7 and 0, which is 7.

Similarly, in [0,1,2,3], the maximum XOR is 3 ⊕ 0 = 3, or 1 ⊕ 2 = 3.

So, in this case, it's not necessarily between the maximum and minimum, but between two elements that differ in the highest possible bits.

So, perhaps I need to find two elements that differ in the most significant bit possible.

To do this, I can try to partition the permutation based on the most significant bit.

For example, find the highest bit position where there exist two numbers that differ in that bit.

Then, select one number where that bit is 0 and another where it's 1.

This would maximize the XOR at that bit position.

Then, proceed to the next bit position, and so on.

This sounds like a divide-and-conquer strategy.

But again, without knowing the actual values, I need to use queries to gather this information.

Wait, but since I can compare any two p_i and p_j directly, I can effectively know their relative order.

So, perhaps I can find the two p_i's that are farthest apart in terms of their values.

But as I thought earlier, this might not always correspond to the maximum XOR.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for any two numbers, their XOR is equal to the OR of the two numbers minus their AND, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of the binary representations.

Let me consider the binary representation of the numbers from 0 to n-1.

Suppose that the numbers are represented with k bits, where k is the smallest integer such that 2^k >= n.

Then, the maximum possible XOR would be a number with all k bits set to 1, which is 2^k - 1.

But, depending on the permutation, the actual maximum XOR might be less than that.

So, perhaps I can find two numbers in the permutation whose XOR is equal to 2^k - 1, if such a pair exists.

If not, then look for a pair whose XOR has the highest possible bit set to 1, and so on.

But again, without knowing the actual values, I need to use queries to gather information about their binary representations.

Wait, perhaps I can fix one element and compare its OR with others to gather information.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look at the provided code and understand what it's doing.

The code is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

maxi = 0

for i in range(1, n):

print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '<':

maxi = i

arr = [0]

for i in range(1, n):

print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '<':

arr = [i]

elif res == '=':

arr.append(i)

mini = arr[0]

for item in arr[1:]:

print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '>':

mini = item

print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)

So, what's happening here?

First, it initializes maxi to 0.

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1, it asks "? maxi maxi i i", which compares p_maxi with p_i.

Based on the response, if p_maxi < p_i, it sets maxi to i.

So, effectively, it's finding the index with the maximum p_i.

Then, it initializes arr with [0].

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1, it asks "? maxi arr[0] maxi i", which compares (p_maxi | p_arr[0]) with (p_maxi | p_i).

Based on the response:

- if "<", set arr to [i]

- if "=", append i to arr

- if ">", do nothing (since arr remains as is)

So, arr ends up containing indices i where (p_maxi | p_i) == (p_maxi | p_arr[0]).

Wait, but arr starts with [0], so p_arr[0] is p_0.

So, it's finding all i where (p_maxi | p_i) == (p_maxi | p_0).

Wait, but p_maxi is the maximum p_i, so p_maxi | p_i is p_maxi, because p_maxi has all bits set that are set in any other p_i.

Wait, is that true?

Not necessarily, because p_maxi might not have all bits set.

Wait, p_maxi is the maximum value in the permutation, so for any other p_i, p_maxi | p_i will be p_maxi, because p_maxi has all the bits set that no other p_i has.

Wait, no. Actually, p_maxi | p_i will be p_maxi only if p_i <= p_maxi, which is always true since p_maxi is the maximum.

Wait, but p_maxi | p_i is p_maxi, because p_maxi has all the bits set that are set in p_i, plus possibly more.

So, (p_maxi | p_i) == p_maxi for all i.

Therefore, (p_maxi | p_i) == (p_maxi | p_j) for all i and j, because both are equal to p_maxi.

So, in this case, comparing (p_maxi | p_i) with (p_maxi | p_j) will always give equality.

Therefore, arr will end up containing all indices from 0 to n-1.

Then, it sets mini to arr[0], which is 0.

Then, for each item in arr[1:], it asks "? mini mini item item", which compares p_mini with p_item.

If p_item < p_mini, set mini to item.

Wait, but p_mini is initially 0, and it's being compared with other items.

But p_mini is being updated to the minimum value among arr.

But arr contains all indices, since (p_maxi | p_i) == (p_maxi | p_j) for all i and j.

So, in this step, it's finding the index with the minimum p_i in the entire permutation.

Then, it prints "! maxi mini", which is the pair with the maximum and minimum values.

But, as I thought earlier, this might not necessarily give the pair with the maximum XOR.

Wait, but in the example provided, it worked.

In the first test case, p=[0,3,1,2], maxi=3, mini=0, and 3 ⊕ 0 = 3, which is the maximum XOR in that permutation.

In the second test case, n=2, p can be [0,1] or [1,0], and in both cases, 0 ⊕ 1 = 1, which is the maximum XOR.

So, in these cases, it worked.

But does it work in general?

Let me think of a counterexample.

Suppose n=3, p=[0,1,2].

maxi=2, mini=0.

2 ⊕ 0 = 2.

But 1 ⊕ 2 = 3, which is larger than 2.

So, in this case, the code would output "! 2 0", which is incorrect, because the maximum XOR is between 1 and 2, which is 3.

Wait, but according to the code, arr would contain all indices, and then mini would be set to 0.

Then, comparing mini=0 with other items:

- compare 0 and 1: p_0=0, p_1=1 → since p_0 < p_1, mini remains 0

- compare 0 and 2: p_0=0, p_2=2 → p_0 < p_2, so mini remains 0

Then, it prints "! 2 0", but the correct pair is 1 and 2.

So, in this case, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, in the first test case, it accepted "! 3 2" as correct, which in that specific permutation was correct.

But in general, as shown in the n=3 example, it's not always correct.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
