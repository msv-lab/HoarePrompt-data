Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and set their prices in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES", followed by the number of stalls and their respective prices. If it's not possible, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand the greedy behavior of Alice. She will always buy as many jewels as possible at each stall, starting from the first stall to the last. So, the order of the stalls matters because she will visit them in sequence.

I need to find a way to partition the total number of jewels k into at most 60 parts, where each part corresponds to the number of jewels bought at a stall, and the cost per jewel at each stall is such that Alice spends as much as possible without exceeding her remaining coins.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to think about this is to consider that for each stall, Alice will buy floor(remaining_coins / price) jewels, and then update her remaining coins accordingly.

I need to choose the prices for up to 60 stalls such that the total number of jewels bought is exactly k.

This seems like a problem where I need to distribute the jewels across the stalls in a way that aligns with Alice's spending behavior.

Let me consider starting from the first stall and trying to maximize the number of jewels bought there, then proceed to the next stall with the remaining coins and jewels.

Wait, but that might not lead to an optimal solution because Alice is greedy and will always buy as many as possible at each stall.

I need to ensure that the total jewels bought across all stalls sum up to k.

Also, I need to make sure that the number of stalls doesn't exceed 60.

Let me consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 7, k = 3

One possible solution is to set up 10 stalls with prices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Let's see how Alice would buy jewels:

- Stall 1: price = 2, jewels = floor(7/2) = 3, remaining coins = 7 - 3*2 = 1

- Since she has only 1 coin left, she can't buy anything from the remaining stalls.

- Total jewels bought: 3, which matches k.

Another example:

n = 6, k = 4

The output is "NO", meaning it's impossible to set up stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels.

Third example:

n = 255, k = 8

One possible solution is to set up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Let's see the buying process:

- Stall 1: price = 128, jewels = floor(255/128) = 1, remaining = 255 - 128 = 127

- Stall 2: price = 64, jewels = floor(127/64) = 1, remaining = 127 - 64 = 63

- Stall 3: price = 32, jewels = floor(63/32) = 1, remaining = 63 - 32 = 31

- Stall 4: price = 16, jewels = floor(31/16) = 1, remaining = 31 - 16 = 15

- Stall 5: price = 8, jewels = floor(15/8) = 1, remaining = 15 - 8 = 7

- Stall 6: price = 4, jewels = floor(7/4) = 1, remaining = 7 - 4 = 3

- Stall 7: price = 2, jewels = floor(3/2) = 1, remaining = 3 - 2 = 1

- Stall 8: price = 1, jewels = floor(1/1) = 1, remaining = 1 - 1 = 0

Total jewels bought: 8, which matches k.

From these examples, it seems that setting up stalls with decreasing prices, starting from a high price and halving it each time, can lead to a solution where Alice buys one jewel per stall.

But in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, the prices are set higher, and Alice buys 3 jewels at the first stall and nothing elsewhere.

So, different strategies are possible depending on the values of n and k.

I need to find a general approach that works for any n and k within the constraints.

Let me consider that for each stall, I can set a price p, and Alice will buy floor(n / p) jewels, where n is her current number of coins.

After buying at this stall, she will have n - (floor(n / p)) * p coins left, which she will take to the next stall.

I need to choose p for each stall such that the sum of jewels bought at all stalls is exactly k.

Also, I need to make sure that the number of stalls doesn't exceed 60.

I need to find a way to distribute the k jewels across up to 60 stalls, choosing prices such that Alice's spending behavior results in buying exactly k jewels.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's think about it differently.

Suppose I have only one stall. Then, Alice will buy floor(n / p) jewels, and I need this to be equal to k.

So, floor(n / p) = k

This implies that p = floor(n / k)

But this might not work because p needs to be an integer, and there might be cases where floor(n / k) doesn't lead to exactly k jewels.

Wait, let's see:

If p = floor(n / k), then floor(n / p) could be greater than k, equal to k, or less than k, depending on n and k.

For example, if n = 10, k = 3:

p = floor(10 / 3) = 3

Then floor(10 / 3) = 3, which matches k.

Another example, n = 7, k = 3:

p = floor(7 / 3) = 2

floor(7 / 2) = 3, which matches k.

Another example, n = 6, k = 4:

p = floor(6 / 4) = 1

floor(6 / 1) = 6, which is greater than k.

In this case, it's impossible to have Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with only one stall.

So, with one stall, it's only possible if floor(n / p) = k, which requires that k <= n / p <= ceil(k).

But in the case where p = floor(n / k), floor(n / p) might be greater than k.

So, with one stall, it's only possible if floor(n / floor(n / k)) = k.

But in the example above, with n=6 and k=4, floor(6 / floor(6 / 4)) = floor(6 / 1) = 6, which is not equal to 4.

Hence, it's impossible with one stall.

But perhaps with multiple stalls, it's possible to achieve k jewels.

Wait, but in the problem, for n=6 and k=4, the output is "NO", meaning it's impossible even with multiple stalls.

So, in some cases, it's impossible, and I need to determine when that is the case.

I need to find a general method to determine if it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Let me think recursively.

Suppose I set up one stall with a certain price p.

Alice buys floor(n / p) jewels, say m jewels, and then has n - m*p coins left.

Then, the problem reduces to: with the remaining coins, set up up to 59 stalls such that Alice buys exactly k - m jewels.

But this seems too vague to implement directly.

Maybe I need to find a way to decompose k into a sum of m1, m2, ..., ms, where s <= 60, and for each mi, there exists a price pi such that Alice buys mi jewels at that stall, given her current coins.

But this is still unclear.

Let me consider the greedy approach in terms of stall setup.

Perhaps I can start by setting up stalls that make Alice buy as few jewels as possible, to try to make her buy exactly k jewels in total.

Wait, but she's greedy, so she buys as many as possible at each stall.

So, to make her buy fewer jewels, I need to set higher prices.

But if I set a very high price, she might buy only a few jewels at the first stall and then have remaining coins to buy more at subsequent stalls.

I need to balance the prices so that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

This is tricky.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal number of jewels she can buy.

If I set all stalls to price 1, she will buy n jewels, which might be more than k.

If I set the price higher, she buys fewer jewels per stall.

I need to adjust the prices so that the total is exactly k.

Another idea: perhaps I can use a binary representation.

For example, in the third test case, with n=255 and k=8, the prices are set to 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, which are powers of 2.

This way, Alice buys one jewel at each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

This works because 255 is 2^8 - 1, and the prices are 2^7 down to 2^0.

So, in general, if n is at least 2^s - 1, and k = s, I can set prices to be powers of 2 up to s stalls.

But in the first example, n=7 and k=3, the prices are not powers of 2; they are 2 through 11.

But in that case, she buys 3 at the first stall and nothing elsewhere.

Wait, that's different.

So, perhaps there are multiple strategies depending on n and k.

I need to find a general method.

Let me consider that for each stall, I can choose a price p, and Alice will buy floor(n / p) jewels, then proceed to the next stall with the remaining coins.

I need to choose p such that the sum of floor(n / p) across all stalls is exactly k.

Also, the number of stalls should be at most 60.

I need an efficient way to choose these p's.

Let me consider starting with the highest possible p and decreasing it.

Wait, perhaps I can use a greedy approach for choosing p.

Let me consider that for the first stall, I choose p such that floor(n / p) is as large as possible, but not exceeding k.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the remaining stalls can make up the remaining k - m jewels with the remaining coins.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal and maximal possible p for each stall.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of stalls s, where 1 <= s <= 60.

Then, I need to choose s prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that sum over i of floor(ni / pi) = k, where ni is the remaining coins after the previous stalls.

This seems too complex to solve directly.

Perhaps I need to find a way to adjust the prices so that the total jewels bought is k.

Wait, maybe I can iterate over the number of stalls and try to find prices accordingly.

But that seems inefficient, especially since s can be up to 60.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that for each stall, I can choose pi such that floor(n / pi) = mi, where mi is the number of jewels bought at that stall.

But pi needs to satisfy that floor(n / pi) = mi, which implies that ceil(n / (mi + 1)) <= pi <= floor(n / mi)

Because floor(n / pi) = mi means that mi <= n / pi < mi + 1, which is equivalent to ceil(n / (mi + 1)) <= pi <= floor(n / mi)

So, for each mi, there is a range of possible pi's that satisfy floor(n / pi) = mi.

So, if I can choose mi's such that sum mi = k, and for each mi, there exists a pi in the range [ceil(n / (mi + 1)), floor(n / mi)], then it's possible.

But I need to make sure that after choosing pi for the first stall, the remaining coins and jewels are feasible for the remaining stalls.

This seems too involved.

Maybe I need to find a way to distribute the jewels across the stalls in a way that the remaining coins allow for the next stalls to buy the required jewels.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Then, the total jewels bought is sum over i of floor(ni / pi), where ni is the remaining coins after the previous stalls.

This seems like a way to partition k into s parts, where each part mi = floor(ni / pi).

But choosing mi directly is tricky because ni depends on the previous choices.

Perhaps I can consider the minimal and maximal possible mi for each stall.

Wait, maybe I can iterate over the number of stalls and try to find a combination of mi's that sum to k and satisfy the coin constraints.

But this seems too time-consuming, especially since s can be up to 60 and k can be up to 10^18.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that if I set up s stalls, each with price p, then Alice will buy floor(n / p) jewels at the first stall, floor((n - floor(n / p)*p) / p) at the second stall, and so on.

But this seems complicated to manage.

Perhaps I need to consider that with multiple stalls, the total jewels bought is the sum of floor(ni / pi), where ni is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider a simpler case: s = 1.

Then, I need floor(n / p) = k, which means p = floor(n / k).

But as I saw earlier, this might not lead to floor(n / p) = k.

Wait, let's think carefully.

If p = floor(n / k), then floor(n / p) could be equal to k, greater than k, or less than k.

I need to check when floor(n / floor(n / k)) = k.

Let me set m = floor(n / k), then floor(n / m) could be greater than, equal to, or less than k, depending on n and k.

For example:

- If n = 10, k = 3: m = floor(10 / 3) = 3, floor(10 / 3) = 3, which equals k.

- If n = 7, k = 3: m = floor(7 / 3) = 2, floor(7 / 2) = 3, which equals k.

- If n = 6, k = 4: m = floor(6 / 4) = 1, floor(6 / 1) = 6, which is greater than k.

So, in the third case, it's impossible with one stall.

But maybe with multiple stalls, it's still impossible.

In the problem, for n=6 and k=4, the output is "NO", meaning it's impossible.

So, perhaps when floor(n / floor(n / k)) >= k, it's possible with one stall, but only if floor(n / floor(n / k)) == k.

Wait, in the first two examples, floor(n / floor(n / k)) equals k.

In the third example, floor(n / floor(n / k)) = 6, which is greater than k=4, and it's impossible.

So, maybe the condition for one stall is that floor(n / floor(n / k)) == k.

But in the first two examples, it holds, and in the third, it doesn't.

But in the third example, even with multiple stalls, it's impossible.

So, perhaps this condition generalizes to multiple stalls.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the minimal number of stalls required is less than or equal to 60.

But I need to find a way to calculate the minimal number of stalls required.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1 >= p2 >= ... >= ps.

Then, Alice will buy floor(n / p1) jewels at the first stall, then floor((n - floor(n / p1)*p1) / p2) at the second stall, and so on.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of jewels bought is exactly k.

This seems too vague to handle directly.

Maybe I need to consider the dual problem: given n and k, find s <= 60 and p1, p2, ..., ps such that sum floor(ni / pi) = k, where ni is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

This seems too complex.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix the number of stalls s and try to distribute k jewels among them.

Then, for each stall, I need to choose mi jewels such that mi <= floor(ni / pi), and sum mi = k.

But I still need to choose pi for each stall.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that for each stall, I can choose pi such that mi = floor(ni / pi).

But ni depends on the previous stalls, making this a dependent system.

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that if I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, then the total jewels bought is sum floor(ni / pi), where ni is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

I need this sum to be exactly k.

This seems too vague to handle directly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the total jewels bought is less than or equal to k, and adjust the prices accordingly.

But I need it to be exactly k.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that for s=1, it's possible only if floor(n / p) = k for some p.

As I saw earlier, this is only possible if floor(n / floor(n / k)) = k.

So, for s=1, the condition is floor(n / floor(n / k)) = k.

Similarly, for s=2, perhaps I can split k into m1 and m2, and set p1 and p2 accordingly.

But this seems too time-consuming.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal number of stalls required is ceil(k / floor(n / k)).

Wait, that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of stalls is the number of times I can take floor(n / p) = m, where m is the number of jewels bought at that stall.

But I'm going in circles here.

Let me consider that for each stall, I can choose p such that floor(n / p) = m, where m is the number of jewels bought at that stall.

Then, p should be in the range [ceil(n / (m + 1)), floor(n / m)].

So, for each m, there is a range of p that satisfies floor(n / p) = m.

Then, I need to choose m1, m2, ..., ms such that sum mi = k, and for each mi, there exists a pi in the range [ceil(n / (mi + 1)), floor(n / mi)].

Also, s <= 60.

This seems promising.

So, I need to partition k into s parts, where s <= 60, and each part mi satisfies that there exists a pi in the range [ceil(n / (mi + 1)), floor(n / mi)].

Moreover, the remaining coins after each stall should allow for the next mi to be achievable.

This still seems too involved.

Let me consider that for the first stall, I choose p1 such that floor(n / p1) = m1, then for the second stall, p2 such that floor((n - m1*p1) / p2) = m2, and so on.

This seems too recursive.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that if n < k, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than she has coins.

Wait, no. For example, if n=1 and k=1, and I set p=1, she buys 1 jewel.

If n=1 and k=1, it's possible.

But if n=1 and k=2, it's impossible because she can't buy 2 jewels with 1 coin.

So, n >= k is a necessary condition.

Wait, no. If n=1, k=2, and I set p=0.5, she would buy 2 jewels.

But in this problem, p has to be an integer >=1.

So, p >=1, and floor(n / p) <= n.

So, if p >=1, then floor(n / p) <= n.

But if p > n, then floor(n / p) = 0.

So, in that case, she buys 0 jewels at that stall.

But since p >=1, the minimal number of jewels she can buy at a stall is 0 (if p > n) or up to floor(n /1) = n.

So, with multiple stalls, she can buy jewels in stages.

But I need to make sure that the total is exactly k.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that with s stalls, I can partition the jewels into s groups, where each group has mi jewels, and sum mi = k.

Then, for each mi, I need to choose pi such that floor(ni / pi) = mi, where ni is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

This still seems too involved.

Let me consider that for the first stall, I choose p1 such that floor(n / p1) = m1.

Then, the remaining coins are n - m1 * p1.

Then, for the second stall, I choose p2 such that floor((n - m1 * p1) / p2) = m2.

And so on, until sum mi = k.

This seems too recursive.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that if I set up s stalls with prices p1 >= p2 >= ... >= ps, then Alice will buy as many as possible at the first stall, then at the second, and so on.

I need to choose the prices in such a way that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

But choosing the prices in decreasing order might not be the best strategy.

Wait, perhaps I can set up stalls with decreasing prices, starting from a high price and decreasing it for each subsequent stall.

But I need to ensure that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

This is still too vague.

Let me consider that for each stall, I can choose p such that floor(n / p) = m, where m is the number of jewels bought at that stall.

Then, p should be in the range [ceil(n / (m + 1)), floor(n / m)].

So, for each m, there is a range of p that satisfies floor(n / p) = m.

Then, I need to partition k into s parts, where s <= 60, and for each mi, there exists a pi in the corresponding range.

Also, the remaining coins after each stall should allow for the next mi to be achievable.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that if I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where p1 <= p2 <= ... <= ps, then Alice will buy jewels starting from the first stall to the last.

But I'm not sure if ordering the prices in a particular way helps.

Wait, perhaps I can set up stalls with increasing prices.

But I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where p1 < p2 < ... < ps, then Alice will buy jewels at each stall depending on her remaining coins.

But I need to ensure that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that with s=1, it's possible only if floor(n / p) = k for some p.

As I saw earlier, this is only possible if floor(n / floor(n / k)) = k.

So, for s=1, I can check this condition.

Similarly, for s=2, I can try to split k into m1 and m2, and choose p1 and p2 accordingly.

But this seems too time-consuming.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the total jewels bought is the sum of floor(ni / pi) for each stall.

I need this sum to be exactly k.

This seems too involved to handle directly.

Perhaps I need to look for a way to make the total jewels bought equal to k by choosing appropriate prices for up to 60 stalls.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that floor(n / p) is the number of jewels bought at a stall.

So, for each stall, floor(n / p) is the number of jewels bought.

Then, I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that sum floor(ni / pi) = k, where ni is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

This seems too recursive.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for the first stall, I choose p1 such that floor(n / p1) = m1.

Then, the remaining coins are n - m1 * p1.

Then, for the second stall, I choose p2 such that floor((n - m1 * p1) / p2) = m2.

And so on, until sum mi = k.

But choosing p1 affects the remaining coins for the next stalls.

This seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to consider that the sum of floor(n / pi) for s stalls is at least k, but I need it to be exactly k.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that if I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, then the total jewels bought is sum floor(ni / pi), where ni is the remaining coins after previous stalls.

I need this sum to be exactly k.

This seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that with s stalls, I can achieve any k between sum floor(n / pi
