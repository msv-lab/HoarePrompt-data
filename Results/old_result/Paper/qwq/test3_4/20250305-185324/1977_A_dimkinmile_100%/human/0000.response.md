Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has some cubes, and he wants to build a tower by adding or removing one cube at a time in each move. The tower starts with no cubes, and after a certain number of moves, n, I need to figure out if it's possible to have exactly m cubes on the tower.

First, I need to understand the operations he can perform. In each move, he can either add one cube to the top or remove one cube from the top. So, it's always one cube at a time, and he can't remove a cube if the tower is empty.

Okay, so let's think about this. If he has n moves and wants to end up with m cubes, what's the relationship between n and m?

Well, if he only adds cubes and never removes any, then after n moves, he would have n cubes. So, if n equals m, that's one possibility.

But he can also remove cubes. So, if he adds a cube and then removes one, that's two moves and the tower remains the same height. Essentially, every pair of add and remove moves doesn't change the height of the tower.

Wait, but the order matters because he can't remove a cube if there isn't one. So, he can't start by removing a cube when the tower is empty.

Let me try to find a general way to approach this.

Suppose he performs a certain number of add operations and a certain number of remove operations within the n moves.

Letâ€™s denote:

- a = number of add operations

- r = number of remove operations

Then, a + r = n, since each move is either add or remove.

The number of cubes in the tower at the end would be the initial number (which is 0) plus the adds minus the removes, so m = a - r.

But since a + r = n, I can express a in terms of r: a = n - r.

Substituting into the m equation: m = (n - r) - r = n - 2r.

So, m = n - 2r.

Now, r can be any integer from 0 up to floor(n/2), because he can't remove more cubes than he has.

So, m = n - 2r, and r >= 0, r <= floor(n/2).

I need to find if there exists an integer r such that m = n - 2r, with r being an integer between 0 and floor(n/2).

Alternatively, rearranging the equation: 2r = n - m, so r = (n - m)/2.

For r to be an integer, (n - m) must be even, and r must be non-negative.

So, the conditions are:

1. (n - m) is even (since r must be an integer)

2. n - m >= 0 (since r can't be negative)

3. r <= floor(n/2) (which is always true if r = (n - m)/2 and m <= n)

Wait, actually, since r = (n - m)/2, and r <= floor(n/2), we need to ensure that (n - m)/2 <= floor(n/2).

Given that, and considering n and m are integers, this should hold as long as (n - m) is even and n - m >= 0.

So, in code, I can check if (n - m) is even and n - m >= 0.

If both these conditions are satisfied, then it's possible to have m cubes after n moves.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Looking back at the example:

Test case 1: n=3, m=3

Check: (3-3)=0, which is even and >=0. So, "Yes"

Test case 2: n=2, m=4

(2-4)=-2, which is even but <0, so "No"

Test case 3: n=5, m=3

(5-3)=2, which is even and >=0, so "Yes"

Seems consistent with the example.

Wait, but is there any other constraint I'm missing?

Let's think about another example.

Suppose n=1, m=1

(1-1)=0, even and >=0, so "Yes"

n=1, m=0

(1-0)=1, which is odd, so "No"

n=2, m=0

(2-0)=2, even and >=0, so "Yes"

n=2, m=2

(2-2)=0, even and >=0, so "Yes"

n=2, m=1

(2-1)=1, odd, so "No"

n=3, m=1

(3-1)=2, even and >=0, so "Yes"

n=3, m=2

(3-2)=1, odd, so "No"

n=3, m=3

As in test case 1, "Yes"

n=3, m=4

(3-4)=-1, <0, so "No"

Seems logical.

Is there any edge case where this logic might fail?

Let's think about n=m=0.

n=0, m=0

(0-0)=0, even and >=0, so "Yes"

But if n=0 and m=0, it means no moves, and the tower starts with 0 cubes, so it's correct.

Another edge case: n=1, m=0

(1-0)=1, which is odd, so "No"

Is that correct? If he has one move, he can either add a cube (m=1) or try to remove a cube, but since the tower is empty, he can't remove a cube. So, only possible m=1, which matches the earlier conclusion.

Another case: n=4, m=2

(4-2)=2, even and >=0, so "Yes"

He can add add add add (m=4), then remove two (m=2), for example.

Or add and remove in different orders, but as long as the difference is even and non-negative, it should work.

I think this covers all possible scenarios.

Now, looking at the provided program:

kreker = int(input())

for i in range(kreker):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

It seems to implement exactly the logic I just derived.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and m, checks if (n - m) is even and >=0, and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

So, based on my reasoning, this program should be correct.

I don't see any flaws in this approach.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after performing `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding one cube to the top of the tower or removing one cube from the top. 

## Approach
1. **Understanding Moves**:
   - Adding a cube increases the tower's height by one.
   - Removing a cube decreases the tower's height by one, but cannot be done if the tower is already empty.

2. **Formulating the Solution**:
   - Let `a` be the number of add operations.
   - Let `r` be the number of remove operations.
   - We have `a + r = n` (total moves).
   - The final number of cubes is `m = a - r`.
   - From these equations, we can derive `m = n - 2r`.
   - For `r` to be a non-negative integer, `(n - m)` must be even and non-negative.

3. **Conditions**:
   - `(n - m)` should be even.
   - `(n - m)` should be greater than or equal to zero.

## Solution Code
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

## Explanation
- **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `kreker`.
- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - Read `n` and `m` for each test case.
  - Check if `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
  - If both conditions are satisfied, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

This approach efficiently determines the possibility of achieving exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves by leveraging simple arithmetic conditions, ensuring it runs in constant time for each test case.
