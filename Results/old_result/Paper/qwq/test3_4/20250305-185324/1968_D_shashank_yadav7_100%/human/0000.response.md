Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about determining who wins a game called "Permutation game" between Bodya and Sasha. They start at certain positions in a permutation and make moves for a fixed number of turns, trying to maximize their scores. The goal is to see who ends up with a higher score after all the turns.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. We have a permutation p of length n, and an array a of length n. Both players start at positions P_B and P_S respectively. The game consists of k turns. Each turn, both players simultaneously:

1. Add a_x to their score, where x is their current position.

2. Choose to stay at their current position or move to p_x.

The winner is the one with the higher score after k turns. If scores are equal, it's a draw.

I need to process multiple test cases, up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, which suggests that the per-testcase time complexity should be O(n).

Looking at the example, it seems that the players can choose to stay or move each turn, and the choice affects their score. The challenge is to find the optimal strategy for both players.

In the provided code, the function `func` is defined to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads n, k, P_B, P_S, the permutation p, and the array a.

It's important to note that positions are 1-indexed in the input, so the code adjusts them to 0-indexed for Python lists.

The code initializes sp (Sasha's score) and bp (Bodya's score) with the values at their starting positions.

Then, it initializes bm (Bodya's maximum possible score) and sm (Sasha's maximum possible score) with k times the value at their starting positions.

The code then enters a loop that runs up to n times, but since k can be up to 10^9, and n is up to 2*10^5, this could be problematic if n is small. However, in the loop, it decreases k by 1 each time and breaks when k == 0.

Inside the loop, it updates the positions of both players according to the permutation p.

Then, it tries to calculate the maximum possible score for both players by considering staying at the current position or moving.

This seems a bit confusing. Let me think about a better way to approach this problem.

I recall that in such problems involving permutations and choices at each step, it's useful to model the permutation as a graph, where each node is a position, and there's an edge from x to p_x.

Since p is a permutation, the graph consists of disjoint cycles.

Given that, the behavior of the players depends on whether their starting positions are in the same cycle or different cycles.

Wait, actually, since they make choices independently, their paths don't directly affect each other.

But perhaps considering the cycle structure isn't immediately helpful here.

Let's think about the choices each player has each turn.

Each turn, a player can choose to stay at the current position or move to p_x.

If they stay, they add a_x to their score and stay at x in the next turn.

If they move, they add a_x to their score and move to p_x for the next turn.

So, for each player, the problem reduces to choosing, at each turn, whether to stay or move.

But since they make these choices simultaneously and independently, we need to find the optimal strategy for each player separately and then compare their scores.

Therefore, the problem decomposes into two separate optimization problems, one for Bodya and one for Sasha.

So, for each player, given their starting position, find the maximum score they can achieve in k turns.

Then, compare the two maximum scores to determine the winner.

Hence, the key is to compute the maximum score each player can achieve individually.

Now, let's focus on one player. How can we compute their maximum score?

Let's consider that at each turn, the player is at some position x, and they can choose to stay at x and add a_x to their score, or move to p_x and add a_x to their score.

Wait, actually, they add a_x regardless of whether they stay or move; the choice is whether to stay at x or move to p_x for the next turn.

Wait, no. According to the problem statement:

- Their score increases by a_x.

- Then, they choose to stay at x or move to p_x.

So, each turn, they are adding a_x to their score, and then choosing where to be in the next turn: x or p_x.

Hence, the choice is about where to be in the next turn.

Given that, for each turn, the player can choose to remain where they are or move to p_x.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each turn, we consider the two choices: stay or move.

However, since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, a standard DP approach with O(n*k) time complexity would be too slow.

Therefore, we need a smarter way to compute the maximum score for each player.

Let's consider that the player can choose to stay at the same position for any number of turns, adding a_x each time, or move to p_x and repeat the process.

This suggests that the player can choose to stay at any position in their cycle for any number of turns before moving to the next position.

But perhaps there's a better way to model this.

I recall that in such scenarios, the optimal strategy often involves staying at the position with the highest a_x in a cycle.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose the player is at position x.

They can choose to stay at x for several consecutive turns, adding a_x each time, or move to p_x and repeat the process.

This is similar to choosing how many times to stay at x before moving to p_x.

Given that, the problem can be modeled as a decision tree where at each node, the player chooses to stay or move.

But again, with k up to 10^9, we need a more efficient approach.

An alternative approach is to observe that the player can choose to stay at any position as many times as they want before moving to the next one.

Hence, the maximum score can be achieved by staying at the positions with the highest a_x as much as possible.

But considering that they can choose to stay or move each turn independently, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the current position if a_x is greater than or equal to a_p_x, otherwise move to p_x.

Wait, that might not always be optimal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total score.

If the player stays at x for t turns, they add t * a_x to their score, and then move to p_x for the remaining k - t turns.

But iterating over all possible t is too slow for large k.

Hence, we need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the permutation forms cycles, and within each cycle, the player can loop around.

Given that, perhaps we can analyze each cycle separately and compute the maximum score within that cycle.

But since the permutation can have multiple cycles, and each player starts at a specific position, we need to handle each cycle independently.

Wait, but in practice, since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n across all test cases up to 2*10^5, we need an efficient way to handle this.

Perhaps we can preprocess the permutation to find the cycles, and then for each player, find which cycle they belong to and compute the maximum score within that cycle.

But I'm not entirely sure yet.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Suppose we can represent the player's path as a sequence of positions where they choose to stay or move each turn.

But again, with k up to 10^9, this seems infeasible.

An alternative idea is to note that the player's position over time can be represented as a sequence where they either stay put or move to p_x.

This can be modeled as a sequence of positions: x0, x1, x2, ..., xk, where each x_{i+1} is either x_i (if they stay) or p_{x_i} (if they move).

Their total score is the sum of a_{x0} + a_{x1} + ... + a_{xk}.

Our goal is to maximize this sum for each player.

Given that, perhaps we can model this as a graph where edges represent the choice to stay or move, and find the path of length k with the maximum sum of a_x.

But again, with large k, this seems inefficient.

Let me think differently.

Suppose the player chooses to stay at position x for t turns, then move to p_x, and repeat this process.

In this case, their score would be t * a_x + maximum score from p_x for the remaining k - t turns.

But again, iterating over t is too slow.

An optimization could be to observe that it's optimal to stay at the position with the highest a_x possible.

Hence, in each cycle, the player should stay at the position with the maximum a_x in that cycle for as many turns as possible.

Therefore, for each cycle, find the position with the maximum a_x, and let's say the player stays there for as many turns as possible.

But how do we handle the movement to reach that position?

This seems a bit involved.

Wait, perhaps we can find, for each player's starting position, the maximum a_x in their cycle, and assume that they spend most of their turns staying at that position.

But we need to account for the steps required to reach that position.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider small values of k and see a pattern.

For k = 1:

- Both players add a_x to their score, where x is their starting position.

- No movement, as k = 1 turn only.

Hence, the player with the higher a_x wins.

For k = 2:

- Turn 1: both add a_x and choose to stay or move.

- Turn 2: add a_x again, based on where they are.

- So, for Bodya:

- Option 1: stay at x1 for both turns: score = 2 * a_x1

- Option 2: stay at x1 for first turn, move to p_x1 for second turn: score = a_x1 + a_p_x1

- Option 3: move to p_x1 for first turn, stay at p_x1 for second turn: score = a_x1 + a_p_x1

- Option 4: move to p_x1 for first turn, then move to p_p_x1 for second turn: score = a_x1 + a_p_x1

Hence, the maximum for Bodya is max(2 * a_x1, a_x1 + a_p_x1)

Similarly for Sasha: max(2 * a_x2, a_x2 + a_p_x2)

Hence, for k = 2, the maximum score is the maximum of staying put for all turns or moving to p_x at some point.

Wait, but in the first example provided, with k=2, n=4, P_B=3, P_S=2, p=[4,1,2,3], a=[7,2,5,6]

Let's compute Bodya's maximum score:

Starting at position 3, a_3 = 5

Option 1: stay at 3 for both turns: score = 5 + 5 = 10

Option 2: stay at 3 for first turn, move to p_3=2 for second turn: score = 5 + 2 = 7

Option 3: move to p_3=2 for first turn, stay at 2 for second turn: score = 5 + 2 = 7

Option 4: move to p_3=2 for first turn, then move to p_2=1 for second turn: score = 5 + 7 = 12

Hence, Bodya's maximum score is 12.

Similarly, Sasha starts at position 2, a_2 = 2

Option 1: stay at 2 for both turns: score = 2 + 2 = 4

Option 2: stay at 2 for first turn, move to p_2=1 for second turn: score = 2 + 7 = 9

Option 3: move to p_2=1 for first turn, stay at 1 for second turn: score = 2 + 7 = 9

Option 4: move to p_2=1 for first turn, then move to p_1=4 for second turn: score = 2 + 6 = 8

Hence, Sasha's maximum score is 9.

But in the example explanation, Bodya's score is 10 and Sasha's is 9, but according to my calculation, Bodya can get 12 by moving to position 2 and then to position 1.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the explanation, Bodya stays at position 3 for both turns, getting 5 + 5 = 10, and Sasha moves from position 2 to position 1 and stays, getting 2 + 7 = 9.

But according to my earlier calculation, Bodya can get 12 by moving to position 2 and then to position 1.

But in the explanation, it seems that Bodya chooses to stay at position 3, getting 10, which is less than the possible 12.

Hence, perhaps the explanation is not showing the optimal strategy for Bodya.

But in the problem statement, it says "it can be shown that Bodya always can win this game", so perhaps 10 is not the optimal score for Bodya, and 12 is possible.

Hence, perhaps there is a mistake in the explanation.

But for the sake of solving the problem, I need to find a general way to compute the maximum possible score for each player.

Looking back, for k=2, we can see that the maximum score is the maximum of:

- k * a_x if staying at x for all k turns

- a_x + maximum score from p_x for k-1 turns

Hence, for each position x, we can precompute the maximum score achievable starting from x for k turns.

This seems like a recursive relationship.

Define dp[x][k] as the maximum score starting from position x with k turns.

Then, dp[x][k] = max(

k * a_x, # staying at x for all k turns

a_x + dp[p_x][k-1] # staying at x for one turn and then moving to p_x for the remaining k-1 turns

)

But with k up to 10^9, this is not feasible to compute directly.

Hence, we need a smarter way to compute this.

I recall that in such problems, if we follow the path defined by the permutation, we can find cycles, and within each cycle, the optimal strategy can be determined based on the maximum a_x in the cycle.

Hence, perhaps we can find the cycle that each position belongs to, find the maximum a_x in that cycle, and then decide how many turns to spend staying at that position.

But we also need to account for the steps required to reach that position.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, find the cycle that each starting position belongs to.

For example, in the first test case:

p = [4,1,2,3]

So, the cycles are:

- Starting at 1: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 (cycle length 4)

Hence, there is one cycle of length 4: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

Given that, for each player, their path is determined by following the cycle.

But they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for any number of turns before moving to the next position.

Hence, to maximize their score, they should spend as many turns as possible at the position with the highest a_x in the cycle.

In the first test case, a = [7,2,5,6]

In the cycle 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1, the maximum a_x is a_1 = 7.

Hence, the optimal strategy is to reach position 1 and stay there for as many turns as possible.

But to reach position 1, they might need to move through other positions.

Given that, the player needs to find the minimal number of moves to reach the position with the maximum a_x in the cycle and then stay there for the remaining turns.

In this case, for Bodya starting at position 3, the path to position 1 is:

Turn 1: move from 3 to 2

Turn 2: move from 2 to 1

Then, stay at 1 for the remaining turns.

Hence, for k=2 turns:

- Turn 1: move from 3 to 2, score += a_3 = 5

- Turn 2: move from 2 to 1, score += a_2 = 2

- Total score: 5 + 2 = 7

But earlier I thought that staying at position 3 for both turns gives 5 + 5 = 10, which is better than moving to position 2 and then to position 1, which gives 5 + 2 = 7.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, moving to position 2 and then to position 1 gives 5 + 7 = 12, but how is that possible?

Wait, no. Let's retrace:

- Starting at position 3, a_3 = 5

- Turn 1: choose to stay at 3, score += 5, or move to p_3 = 2

- If stay: turn 2, stay at 3 again, score +=5, total 10

- If move to 2, turn 2: choose to stay at 2, score +=2, total 5+2=7

- Or, move from 2 to p_2=1, score += a_1=7, total 5+7=12

Hence, the maximum is 12.

But in the explanation, Bodya stays at 3 for both turns, getting 10, and Sasha moves from 2 to 1 and stays, getting 9.

But according to this, Bodya can get 12, which is higher than Sasha's 9.

Hence, perhaps the explanation is not showing the optimal strategy for Bodya.

Therefore, I need to find a way to compute the maximum possible score for each player.

Given that, perhaps the optimal strategy is to identify the position with the maximum a_x in the cycle and spend as many turns as possible at that position.

To do that, the player needs to reach that position as soon as possible and then stay there.

Given that, for each player, we can:

1. Identify the cycle that their starting position belongs to.

2. Find the position in that cycle with the maximum a_x.

3. Compute the minimal number of moves required to reach that position from the starting position.

4. Spend the remaining turns staying at that position.

Hence, the maximum score is:

- Sum of a_x for each move made to reach the optimal position.

- Plus, the number of stays at the optimal position multiplied by a_opt.

Where a_opt is the maximum a_x in the cycle.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s define:

- opt: position in the cycle with maximum a_x.

- path_length: minimal number of moves to reach opt from starting position.

- turns_spent_moving: path_length

- turns_spent_staying: k - path_length

- maximum_score: sum of a_x along the path to opt, plus (k - path_length) * a_opt

Hence, for each player, we need to compute this.

But we need to be careful because the cycle might be longer than k, or k might be larger than the cycle length.

But in this approach, since we're considering the cycle structure, and identifying the optimal position in the cycle, and the minimal path to reach it, this should work.

Let me apply this to the first test case.

For Bodya starting at 3:

- Cycle: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3

- a = [7,2,5,6]

- Maximum a_x in the cycle is a_1 = 7

- Path from 3 to 1: 3 -> 2 -> 1, path_length = 2

- turns_spent_moving = 2

- turns_spent_staying = k - path_length = 2 - 2 = 0

- maximum_score = a_3 + a_2 + 0 * a_1 = 5 + 2 + 0 = 7

But earlier, I calculated that Bodya can get 12 by moving to 2 and then to 1 and staying at 1 if k were larger, but for k=2, it seems like 7 is the score.

Wait, but in the example explanation, Bodya stays at 3 for both turns and gets 10.

But according to this approach, the maximum score is 7.

This suggests that there is a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the path.

Wait, in the first turn, Bodya can choose to stay at 3 or move to 2.

- If stay at 3: score +=5, position remains 3

- If move to 2: score +=5, position changes to 2

In the second turn:

- If stayed at 3 in first turn:

- Stay at 3: score +=5, total 10

- Move to 2: score +=5, total 10

- If moved to 2 in first turn:

- Stay at 2: score +=2, total 5+2=7

- Move to 1: score +=7, total 5+7=12

Hence, the maximum is 12, not 10.

But according to the earlier approach, maximum_score = a_3 + a_2 + 0 * a_1 = 5 + 2 + 0 =7, which is incorrect.

Hence, there is a flaw in that approach.

Perhaps the issue is that in the first turn, when choosing to move to p_x, the score is a_x, and then in the next turn, starting from p_x.

Hence, in the first turn, moving from 3 to 2 adds a_3=5, and then in the second turn, staying at 2 adds a_2=2, total 7.

Alternatively, moving from 3 to 2 (add a_3=5), then moving from 2 to 1 (add a_2=2), total 5+2=7.

Or, moving from 3 to 2 (add a_3=5), then staying at 2 (add a_2=2), total 5+2=7.

Alternatively, staying at 3 in first turn (add a_3=5), then staying at 3 in second turn (add a_3=5), total 10.

Alternatively, staying at 3 in first turn (add a_3=5), then moving to 2 in second turn (add a_3=5), total 10.

Wait, but moving to 2 in the second turn should add a_2, not a_3.

Wait, no.

Let's clarify:

- First turn:

- Option 1: stay at 3, score += a_3=5, position remains 3

- Option 2: move to p_3=2, score += a_3=5, position changes to 2

- Second turn:

- If stayed at 3 in first turn:

- Option 1: stay at 3, score += a_3=5, total 5+5=10

- Option 2: move to p_3=2, score += a_3=5, total 5+5=10

- If moved to 2 in first turn:

- Option 1: stay at 2, score += a_2=2, total 5+2=7

- Option 2: move to p_2=1, score += a_2=2, total 5+2=7

Hence, the maximum for Bodya is 10.

Wait, but earlier I thought moving to 1 would add a_1=7, but actually, when moving to p_x, you add a_x, which is a_2=2 in this case.

Wait, no.

Wait, the rule is:

- Add a_x to score

- Then, choose to stay at x or move to p_x

Hence, when moving to p_x, you add a_x, not a_p_x.

Hence, moving to p_x means you add a_x and then your position becomes p_x for the next turn.

Hence, in the first turn:

- Stay at 3: score += a_3=5, position remains 3

- Move to 2: score += a_3=5, position changes to 2

In the second turn:

- If stayed at 3:

- Stay at 3: score += a_3=5, total 5+5=10

- Move to 2: score += a_3=5, total 5+5=10

- If moved to 2:

- Stay at 2: score += a_2=2, total 5+2=7

- Move to 1: score += a_2=2, total 5+2=7

Hence, the maximum is indeed 10.

So, in this case, staying at 3 for both turns gives the maximum score.

Hence, the earlier approach was incorrect because it didn't account properly for the scoring when moving.

Let me try to adjust the approach.

Perhaps, for each player, we can compute the maximum score by considering that in each turn, they can choose to stay at the current position and add a_x, or move to p_x and add a_x.

Hence, the decision is whether to stay or move each turn, with the goal of maximizing the sum of a_x over k turns.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each turn, we consider the two choices: stay or move.

However, with k up to 10^9, we need a smarter way.

I recall that in such problems, if we iterate through the cycle, we can find that the optimal strategy involves reaching a certain position and then staying there.

But perhaps we can model this as a linear recurrence.

Wait, another idea: for each player, find the maximum a_x in their cycle, and compute the minimal number of moves required to reach that position.

Then, spend the remaining turns staying at that position.

In the first test case, for Bodya starting at 3:

- Cycle: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3

- a = [7,2,5,6]

- Maximum a_x in cycle is a_1=7

- Path from 3 to 1: 3 -> 2 -> 1, path_length=2

- k=2, so path_length =2, turns_spent_staying = k - path_length =0

- Hence, maximum_score = a_3 + a_2 + 0*a_1 =5 +2 +0=7

But earlier, we saw that staying at 3 for both turns gives 10, which is better.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

Perhaps the issue is that moving to p_x adds a_x, not a_p_x.

Wait, no, the scoring is always a_x, regardless of whether you stay or move.

The confusion is that when you choose to move, you add a_x and then your position becomes p_x for the next turn.

Hence, in the first turn:

- Stay: add a_x, remain at x

- Move: add a_x, move to p_x

Hence, in the first turn, regardless of whether you stay or move, you add a_x.

Only the position for the next turn changes.

Given that, perhaps the maximum score is simply k * max(a_x for x in the cycle), because you can choose to stay at the position with the maximum a_x for all k turns.

But in reality, you might need to move to reach that position first.

Hence, the strategy should be to reach the position with the maximum a_x as quickly as possible and then stay there.

In the first test case, Bodya starts at 3, a_3=5

The position with maximum a_x in the cycle is 1, a_1=7

Path from 3 to 1: 3 -> 2 ->1, path_length=2

Hence, in k=2 turns:

- Turn 1: move from 3 to 2, score +=5

- Turn 2: move from 2 to 1, score +=2

- Total score:7

But if Bodya stays at 3 for both turns: score=5+5=10, which is better.

Hence, in this case, staying at 3 is better than trying to reach the position with the highest a_x.

This suggests that the strategy should be:

- If a_x >= a_p_x, stay at x for all k turns.

- Else, move to p_x and follow the same strategy.

Hence, for each player, find the position x such that a_x is maximum in the cycle, and stay at that position for all k turns.

To do that, find the position x in the cycle with the maximum a_x, and compute the minimal path length to reach it.

Then, spend the remaining turns staying at that position.

But in the first test case, a_1=7 is the maximum in the cycle.

But reaching it in 2 turns and then staying there for 0 turns gives a score of 5+2=7, which is less than staying at 3 for both turns (5+5=10).

Hence, this approach is still not optimal.

Perhaps the issue is that a_x is added regardless of whether you stay or move.

Hence, the total score is the sum of a_x for each turn, where x is the current position.

The choice is whether to stay or move, but a_x is added either way.

Hence, the problem reduces to choosing, for each turn, whether to stay or move.

This seems similar to choosing a path in the graph where each edge corresponds to staying or moving, and the weight is a_x.

Given that, it's equivalent to finding a path of length k starting from the initial position, maximizing the sum of a_x along the path.

This can be modeled as a DP where dp[x][k] is the maximum sum starting at x with k turns.

But with k up to 10^9, this is too slow.

An optimization can be made by observing that in a cycle, the optimal path can be found by considering the maximum a_x in the cycle and the minimal path to reach it.

But in the first test case, this approach fails because staying put gives a better score than trying to reach the position with the highest a_x.

Hence, perhaps the strategy should be:

- If a_x >= a_p_x, stay at x for all k turns.

- Else, move to p_x and follow the same strategy.

In other words, for each player, find the position x in their cycle where a_x is locally maximum, meaning a_x >= a_p_x, and stay there for as many turns as possible.

Hence, for Bodya starting at 3, a_3=5, a_p3=a_2=2 < a_3, so stay at 3 for all k turns.

For Sasha starting at 2, a_2=2, a_p2=a_1=7 > a_2, so move to 1 and stay there for the remaining turns.

In the first test case:

- Bodya stays at 3 for both turns: score=5+5=10

- Sasha moves from 2 to 1, then stays at 1: score=2+7=9

Hence, Bodya wins.

This seems to align with the example explanation.

Hence, the strategy is:

For each player:

- While a_x < a_p_x, move to p_x.

- Once a_x >= a_p_x, stay at x for all remaining turns.

Hence, for each player, find the position x in their path where a_x >= a_p_x, and stay there for the remaining turns.

The number of moves required to reach such a position is the path length.

Then, the maximum score is:

- Sum of a_x for each move made to reach the position where a_x >= a_p_x

- Plus, the number of stays at that position multiplied by a_x

This seems efficient and can be computed in O(n) per test case.

Let me implement this logic.

First, for each player, traverse the permutation until a position where a_x >= a_p_x is found.

Keep track of the sum of a_x for each move.

Once such a position is found, stay there for the remaining turns.

If the cycle is such that a_x < a_p_x for all positions, which is impossible since it's a cycle and at least one position must satisfy a_x >= a_p_x.

Hence, this approach should work.

Let me apply this to the first test case.

For Bodya starting at 3:

- a_3=5, a_p3=a_2=2 <5, so stay at 3 for all k=2 turns: score=5+5=10

For Sasha starting at 2:

- a_2=2, a_p2=a_1=7 >2, so move to 1

- a_1=7, a_p1=a_4=6 <7, so stay at 1 for the remaining k-1=1 turn: score=2+7=9

Hence, Bodya wins with 10 > 9.

This matches the example.

Another test case:

n=2, k=1, P_B=1, P_S=2

p=[2,1]

a=[1,100]

- Bodya starts at 1, a_1=1, a_p1=a_2=100 >1, so move to 2: score=1

- Stay at 2 for remaining k-1=0 turns: total score=1

- Sasha starts at 2, a_2=100, a_p2=a_1=1 <100, so stay at 2: score=100

- Hence, Sasha wins with 100 >1

Another test case:

n=2, k=1, P_B=1, P_S=2

p=[2,1]

a=[100,1]

- Bodya starts at 1, a_1=100, a_p1=a_2=1 <100, so stay at 1: score=100

- Sasha starts at 2, a_2=1, a_p2=a_1=100 >1, so move to 1: score=1

- Stay at 1 for remaining k-1=0 turns: total score=1

- Hence, Bodya wins with 100 >1

This seems consistent.

Hence, the strategy is:

For each player:

- While a_x < a_p_x, move to p_x and add a_x to the score.

- Once a_x >= a_p_x, stay at x for the remaining turns, adding a_x for each stay.

Hence, for each player, find the position x where a_x >= a_p_x, and compute the sum accordingly.

Now, to implement this efficiently, we can simulate the movement for each player until they reach a position where a_x >= a_p_x, keeping track of the sum of a_x for the moves made.

Then, add (k - path_length) * a_x, where x is the position where a_x >= a_p_x.

But we need to ensure that we don't exceed k turns while moving.

In the first test case, for Bodya:

- a_3 >= a_2, so stay at 3 for all k=2 turns: score=5+5=10

For Sasha:

- a_2 < a_1, so move to 1: score +=2

- a_1 >= a_4, so stay at 1 for remaining k-1=1 turn: score +=7

- Total score=2+7=9

Hence, Bodya's score=10 > Sasha's score=9

Another example:

n=2, k=2, P_B=1, P_S=2

p=[2,1]

a=[1,100]

- Bodya starts at 1, a_1=1 < a_p1=100, so move to 2: score +=1

- Then, stay at 2: score +=100, total=1+100=101

- Sasha starts at 2, a_2=100 >= a_p2=1, so stay at 2 for both turns: score=100+100=200

- Hence, Sasha wins with 200 >101

Wait, but according to the earlier strategy, Sasha should stay at 2 for both turns, scoring 100+100=200

Bodya moves to 2 in the first turn, scoring 1, then stays at 2 in the second turn, scoring 100, total 101

Hence, Sasha wins.

This seems correct.

Hence, the strategy is sound.

Now, let's look back at the provided code.

In the provided code:

- It initializes sp and bp with a_s and a_b respectively.

- Then, it initializes sm and
