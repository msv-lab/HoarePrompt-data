Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting subarray is one that can be divided into at least two parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR means. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is asking me to check for subarrays defined by indices l and r, whether it's possible to split that subarray into at least two consecutive segments where each segment's XOR is equal.

Let me think about how to approach this. I know that for the entire array, if I can find multiple segments whose XOR is the same, then the array is interesting. But I need to do this for multiple subarrays defined by l and r.

I recall that prefix XOR can be useful in these kinds of problems. Prefix XOR is like a prefix sum, but instead of summing, we XOR the elements up to a certain point. So, if I have a prefix XOR array, pf, where pf[i] is the XOR of all elements from 1 to i, then the XOR of a subarray from l to r would be pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

So, for a subarray from l to r, its XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]. Now, for this subarray to be interesting, I need to be able to split it into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let me consider that. If I split the subarray at some index k, where l <= k < r, then the two parts would be from l to k and k+1 to r. The XOR of the first part is pf[k] XOR pf[l-1], and the XOR of the second part is pf[r] XOR pf[k]. For these two to be equal, pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] should equal pf[r] XOR pf[k].

Wait, that seems promising. Let's see:

pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[k]

If I rearrange this, I can bring pf[k] to both sides:

pf[k] XOR pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r]

Which simplifies to:

pf[l-1] = pf[r]

Wait, that can't be right because if pf[l-1] = pf[r], then the XOR of the subarray from l to r would be pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0. So, in this case, the subarray from l to r has an XOR of 0.

But in general, for the subarray to be interesting, I need to have at least two parts with equal XOR. If the entire subarray's XOR is 0, that might be a special case.

Let me think differently. Suppose the XOR of the entire subarray from l to r is X. If I can find at least one split point k where l <= k < r, such that the XOR from l to k is X and the XOR from k+1 to r is also X, then the subarray is interesting.

But wait, if the XOR from l to k is X, and the XOR from k+1 to r is also X, then the XOR of the entire subarray would be X XOR X = 0. So, unless the entire subarray's XOR is 0, I can't have two parts with the same XOR.

Wait, that seems contradictory to the example given. In the example, for subarray [1,1,2,3,0], the XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 0. And it can be split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], each with XOR 1.

Wait, in this case, the XOR of the entire subarray is 0, and it's split into parts with equal XOR. So, perhaps the condition is that the XOR of the entire subarray is 0, and there exists at least one split point where the XOR of the left part equals the XOR of the right part.

But in the example, the XOR of each part is not 0, but they are equal to each other.

Wait, in the first split [1], [1], [2,3,0], each part has XOR 1, which is not zero, but the overall XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, which is not zero. Wait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Let me recalculate the XOR for the entire array. a = [1,1,2,3,0]

pf[1] = 1

pf[2] = 1 XOR 1 = 0

pf[3] = 0 XOR 2 = 2

pf[4] = 2 XOR 3 = 1

pf[5] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

So, pf[5] = 1, which means XOR from 1 to 5 is pf[5] XOR pf[0] = 1 XOR 0 = 1.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that [1], [1], [2,3,0] each have XOR 1, and the overall XOR would be 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, not zero. So, my earlier assumption that the overall XOR must be zero is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I need to rethink this.

Let me consider that for the subarray to be interesting, it must be split into at least two parts with equal XOR, but the overall XOR of the subarray doesn't necessarily have to be zero.

Wait, but in the example, the overall XOR is 1, not zero, and it's still interesting.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have a subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into k parts where k >= 2, and each part has the same XOR value, say Y.

Then, the overall XOR of the subarray would be Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times). If k is even, Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y = 0. If k is odd, it's Y.

So, depending on whether k is even or odd, the overall XOR would be 0 or Y.

Wait, that seems important.

So, if k is even, overall XOR is 0.

If k is odd, overall XOR is Y.

In the example, k=3 (which is odd), and overall XOR is 1, which matches Y=1.

In another split, if k is even, overall XOR should be 0.

So, in general, for the subarray to be interesting, depending on the number of parts k:

- If k is even, overall XOR should be 0.

- If k is odd, overall XOR should be Y, where Y is the XOR of each part.

But the problem states that k > 1.

So, for k >= 2, we have two cases:

1. k is even: overall XOR is 0.

2. k is odd: overall XOR is Y.

But Y is the XOR of each part, and Y must be non-zero because k >= 2.

Wait, but Y could be zero even if k >= 2.

For example, if all parts have XOR 0.

But according to the problem, k >1 and parts have equal XOR.

So, if Y=0, then overall XOR is 0 regardless of k.

But in that case, k can be any even or odd number greater than 1.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Let me consider that for a subarray to be interesting, it must be possible to split it into at least two parts with equal XOR.

I need to find a way to check, for a given l and r, whether there exists at least one split point k where l <= k < r, such that the XOR from l to k is equal to the XOR from k+1 to r.

But in reality, for k parts, I need to have k-1 split points where the XOR of each segment is equal.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can think in terms of prefix XOR values.

Let me consider the prefix XOR array pf, where pf[i] is the XOR of elements from 1 to i.

Then, the XOR of a subarray from l to r is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, if I want to split the subarray from l to r into two parts at position k, where l <= k < r, then:

- XOR of first part: pf[k] XOR pf[l-1]

- XOR of second part: pf[r] XOR pf[k]

For these two to be equal:

pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[k]

Which simplifies to:

pf[l-1] = pf[r]

Wait, that's only possible if pf[l-1] = pf[r].

So, for two parts to have equal XOR, pf[l-1] must equal pf[r].

In that case, the XOR of the entire subarray from l to r is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0.

So, if pf[l-1] = pf[r], then the subarray from l to r has XOR 0, and it can be split into two parts with equal XOR.

Similarly, for k >= 2, if the subarray can be split into k parts with equal XOR, then:

- If k is even, overall XOR is 0.

- If k is odd, overall XOR is Y.

But in the case of k=2, overall XOR must be 0.

In k=3, overall XOR is Y.

In k=4, overall XOR is 0.

And so on.

This seems like a pattern based on parity.

But I need a general way to check for any k >=2 whether such a split exists.

Maybe instead of thinking about k parts, I should think about the frequency of prefix XOR values within the subarray.

Let me consider that.

For a subarray from l to r, I can look at the prefix XOR values from l to r.

I need to see if there are multiple indices within l to r where the prefix XOR value is equal.

Wait, perhaps not directly.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix l and r.

I need to check if there exists at least one k where l <= k < r such that pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[k].

Wait, that's the same as pf[l-1] = pf[r], as I saw earlier.

So, in that case, if pf[l-1] = pf[r], then I can split the subarray into two parts with equal XOR.

But the problem allows for splitting into any k >1 parts, not necessarily two.

So, maybe there are subarrays where pf[l-1] != pf[r], but still, it can be split into more than two parts with equal XOR.

For example, in the first test case, for l=1 to r=5, pf[0]=0, pf[5]=1, so pf[l-1] != pf[r], but it can still be split into three parts, each with XOR=1.

So, in that case, pf[l-1] != pf[r], but it's still interesting.

So, my earlier approach for k=2 doesn't cover all cases.

I need a more general solution.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r to be split into k parts with equal XOR Y, then:

- The overall XOR of the subarray is Y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

- Each part has XOR Y.

So, for the subarray from l to r, its XOR is (Y if k is odd) or (0 if k is even).

Therefore, if the subarray's XOR is 0, then k can be even.

If the subarray's XOR is Y !=0, then k must be odd.

But in both cases, I need to ensure that there are at least two parts.

Wait, but in the first case, if the subarray's XOR is 0, then k can be even.

But k can also be odd with Y=0.

Wait, but the problem allows Y to be zero.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR] of values from each part are equal."

So, Y can be zero.

Meaning, it's possible to have k >=2 parts, each with XOR Y=0.

In that case, the overall XOR would be 0 if k is even, or 0 if k is odd.

Wait, 0 XOR 0 ... k times is always 0.

So, if Y=0 and k >=2, then the overall XOR is 0.

In the case where Y !=0 and k >=2 and k is odd, the overall XOR is Y.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of times Y appears in the XOR.

If k is even, Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times) = 0.

If k is odd, Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times) = Y.

So, for the subarray to be interesting:

- If k is even, overall XOR must be 0.

- If k is odd, overall XOR must be Y.

But Y can be zero or non-zero.

If Y=0, then overall XOR is 0 for any k.

If Y !=0, then overall XOR is 0 for even k, and Y for odd k.

So, in the case where overall XOR is 0, it could be split into even k parts with Y=0, or into odd k parts with Y=0.

Wait, I'm getting tangled up.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r to be interesting, there must exist at least two indices within l to r where the prefix XOR value is equal.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think about it.

If there are multiple indices where the prefix XOR is equal, that might indicate that the XOR between those indices is zero.

But I need the XOR of the parts to be equal, not necessarily zero.

Hmm.

Perhaps I need to look for repeated prefix XOR values within the subarray.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the difference in prefix XOR values.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the frequency of prefix XOR values within the subarray.

Let me think about frequency.

I can keep track of how often each prefix XOR value appears within the subarray.

If a particular XOR value appears multiple times, that might indicate that the XOR between those positions is zero.

But I need to generalize this to the case where the XOR of segments is equal to some Y, not necessarily zero.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r to be interesting, it must be possible to partition it into at least two consecutive segments with equal XOR.

This sounds similar to partitioning the array into subsets with equal sums, but with XOR instead.

I wonder if there's a way to use dynamic programming for this, but given the constraints, it's not feasible due to time limits.

Wait, n and q can be up to 2e5, so I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) or O(n).

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

XOR is associative and commutative, which is helpful.

I recall that for a subarray from l to r, its XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, if I can find a k where l <= k < r such that pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[k], which simplifies to pf[l-1] = pf[r], then the two parts have equal XOR.

But as I saw earlier, this only works when pf[l-1] = pf[r].

In that case, the overall XOR of the subarray is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0.

So, if pf[l-1] = pf[r], then the subarray's XOR is zero, and it can be split into two parts with equal XOR.

But in the example provided, there are cases where pf[l-1] != pf[r], yet the subarray is still interesting because it can be split into an odd number of parts with equal XOR.

So, perhaps I need to check for both cases:

1. If the subarray's XOR is 0, then it can be split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

2. If the subarray's XOR is Y !=0, then it can be split into an odd number of parts with XOR Y.

But I need to ensure that such a split is possible.

Wait, maybe I can check if there exists at least one split point where the XOR of the left part equals the XOR of the right part, which would imply that the subarray can be split into two parts with equal XOR, making it interesting.

But earlier, I saw that pf[l-1] must equal pf[r] for this to happen.

However, in the example, there are cases where pf[l-1] != pf[r], yet the subarray is still interesting because it can be split into more than two parts with equal XOR.

So, perhaps checking for pf[l-1] = pf[r] is sufficient but not necessary for the subarray to be interesting.

I need a way to generalize this.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r to be interesting, there must be at least one way to split it into k >=2 parts with equal XOR.

This seems similar to finding repeating patterns in the XOR values.

Wait, maybe I can precompute all possible XOR values for the subarrays and see if there are multiple segments with the same XOR.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think about the frequency of prefix XOR values within the subarray.

For a subarray from l to r, I can look at the prefix XOR values from l to r.

If there are multiple indices within l to r where the prefix XOR value is equal, that might indicate that the XOR of the subarray between those indices is zero, which could be useful.

But in this problem, I need the XOR of the parts to be equal, not necessarily zero.

Wait, perhaps I can normalize the prefix XOR values by subtracting a certain value.

But XOR doesn't directly support subtraction.

Wait, maybe I can look for differences in prefix XOR values.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to find a different approach.

I recall that for a subarray to be divided into k parts with equal XOR, the XOR of the entire subarray must be k*Y, but since XOR is not linear in that way, this might not apply.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR Y, the overall XOR is Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, for a given subarray, if its XOR is 0, then it can be split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

If its XOR is Y !=0, then it can be split into an odd number of parts with XOR Y.

Therefore, to check if a subarray is interesting, I need to:

- Compute the XOR of the subarray from l to r.

- If the XOR is 0, then it can be split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

- If the XOR is Y !=0, then it can be split into an odd number of parts with XOR Y.

But I need to ensure that such a split is possible, meaning that there exists at least one way to divide the subarray into k >=2 parts with equal XOR.

However, this still doesn't give me a direct way to check for each query.

Maybe I need to precompute something.

Let me consider precomputing the frequency of prefix XOR values.

I can create a map that stores for each XOR value, the list of indices where that XOR value appears.

Then, for a given subarray from l to r, I can see if there are multiple indices within l to r where the prefix XOR value is equal to pf[l-1] + Y for some Y.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a different angle.

Suppose I fix l and r.

I need to check if there exists at least one Y such that the subarray from l to r can be split into k >=2 parts with each part having XOR Y.

Given that, I need to find Y and k such that:

- If k is even, overall XOR is 0.

- If k is odd, overall XOR is Y.

Given that, for a given subarray with XOR X, I need to find Y and k such that:

- If k is even, X = 0.

- If k is odd, X = Y.

So, for a subarray with XOR X:

- If X = 0, then k must be even.

- If X !=0, then k must be odd.

But I need to ensure that such a k exists, meaning that the subarray can indeed be split into k parts with equal XOR.

Wait, but if X =0, then k must be even, and each part has some Y.

But Y would be such that Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times) =0, which holds.

Similarly, if X !=0, then k must be odd, and Y =X.

But I need to ensure that the subarray can actually be split into k parts with each part having XOR Y.

This seems too abstract.

Let me try to think about necessary and sufficient conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

Necessary and sufficient conditions:

- For the subarray from l to r to be interesting, it must be possible to split it into k >=2 parts with equal XOR.

- As derived earlier, if k is even, the overall XOR must be 0.

- If k is odd, the overall XOR must be Y.

So, for a subarray with XOR X:

- If X =0, then it can be split into even k parts with equal XOR.

- If X !=0, it can be split into odd k parts with XOR Y =X.

But I need to ensure that such a split is possible.

Wait, perhaps in all cases where X =0, it's possible to split into even k parts with Y=0.

But that might not always be possible.

Wait, if X=0, it's possible to split into even k parts with Y=0.

But in reality, it might not be possible depending on the subarray.

Wait, for example, if the subarray is [1,1], its XOR is 0, and it can be split into two parts: [1], [1], each with XOR 1.

Wait, but according to the condition, if X=0, then k is even, and each part has XOR Y.

But in this case, Y=1, not 0.

Wait, that seems inconsistent with my earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Let me look back.

If the subarray's XOR is 0, and it's split into k parts with equal XOR Y, then:

- If k is even, Y can be any value such that Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times) =0.

- If k is odd, Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times) =Y.

Wait, but in the earlier example, [1,1], X=0, k=2, Y=1.

But 1 XOR 1 =0, which matches X=0.

So, in this case, Y=1, k=2 (even), X=0.

This fits the pattern.

Another example: [1,1,2,3,0], X=1, k=3 (odd), Y=1.

X=Y, which matches.

So, the condition seems to hold.

Therefore, a subarray is interesting if:

- If X=0, then it can be split into even k parts with Y=0.

- If X !=0, it can be split into odd k parts with Y=X.

But I need to ensure that such a split is possible.

In other words, for X=0, I need to check if there exists at least one way to split the subarray into even k parts where each part has XOR 0.

Similarly, for X !=0, check if there exists at least one way to split into odd k parts where each part has XOR X.

But this still seems too vague for an efficient implementation.

Let me consider that for X=0, I need to find at least two points where the prefix XOR equals some value, indicating that the XOR between those points is zero.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there are multiple occurrences of the same prefix XOR value within the subarray.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the subarray from l to r.

I need to check if there exists at least one split point k where l <= k < r such that the XOR from l to k equals the XOR from k+1 to r.

But as I saw earlier, this is only possible if pf[l-1] = pf[r].

But in the example, there are cases where pf[l-1] != pf[r], yet the subarray is still interesting because it can be split into more than two parts with equal XOR.

So, perhaps checking for pf[l-1] = pf[r] is sufficient for k=2, but not for higher k.

I need a way to generalize this for any k >=2.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r to be interesting, there must be at least one way to split it into k >=2 parts with equal XOR.

This seems too slow to check for each query.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each possible XOR value, the positions where the prefix XOR equals that value.

Then, for a given subarray from l to r, I can see if there are multiple positions within l to r where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] + Y for some Y.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r to be interesting, there must be at least one Y such that Y appears at least twice in the prefix XOR values within l to r.

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, if Y appears at least twice in the subarray, then there are at least two segments with XOR Y.

But I need to ensure that the entire subarray can be partitioned into such segments.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that for the subarray to be interesting, the XOR of the subarray must be achievable by splitting it into at least two parts with equal XOR.

So, if the subarray's XOR is X, then:

- If X=0, it can be split into even k parts with Y=0.

- If X !=0, it can be split into odd k parts with Y=X.

But I need to ensure that such a split exists.

Wait, perhaps I can check if there exists at least one split point where the XOR of the left part equals X (if k is odd) or 0 (if k is even).

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix l and r.

Compute X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If X=0, then I need to check if there exists at least one k where l <=k < r such that the XOR from l to k equals 0, and the XOR from k+1 to r equals 0.

But if X=0, then pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] =0 and pf[r] XOR pf[k]=0.

Which implies pf[k] = pf[l-1] and pf[k] = pf[r].

So, pf[l-1] must equal pf[r], which is already the case since X=0.

Therefore, if X=0, and pf[l-1] = pf[r], then I can split the subarray into two parts with XOR 0.

Similarly, for higher even k, I can have multiple splits where each part has XOR 0.

So, in this case, the subarray is interesting if X=0 and there exists at least one k where pf[k] = pf[l-1] within l to r.

Wait, but pf[k] = pf[l-1] implies that the XOR from l to k is zero.

So, if there exists at least one k where l <=k < r and pf[k] = pf[l-1], then the subarray can be split into two parts: from l to k with XOR 0, and from k+1 to r with XOR 0.

Similarly, for X !=0, I need to check if there exists at least one way to split the subarray into an odd number of parts with each part having XOR X.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps for X !=0, I need to check if there exists at least one k where l <=k < r such that pf[k] XOR pf[l-1] =X and pf[r] XOR pf[k] =X.

Which simplifies to pf[k] = pf[l-1] XOR X and pf[k] = pf[r] XOR X.

So, pf[l-1] XOR X = pf[r] XOR X, which implies pf[l-1] = pf[r].

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, pf[l-1] XOR X = pf[r] XOR X implies pf[l-1] = pf[r].

But if pf[l-1] = pf[r], then X=0.

So, this only holds when X=0.

Therefore, for X !=0, there is no k that satisfies pf[k] = pf[l-1] XOR X and pf[k] = pf[r] XOR X unless pf[l-1] = pf[r], which would imply X=0.

This seems contradictory.

So, perhaps for
