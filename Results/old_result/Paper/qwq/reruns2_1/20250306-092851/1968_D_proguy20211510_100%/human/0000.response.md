Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this game called "Permutation game" involving Bodya and Sasha. They have a permutation and an array, and they play this game for k turns. Each turn, they can choose to stay in their current position or move to a new position based on the permutation. Their score increases by the value of the array at their current position each turn. The goal is to determine who wins the game based on their final scores after k turns, assuming both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the input and what's being asked. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, I get the length of the permutation n, the number of turns k, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, P_B and P_S. Then, there's the permutation p of length n and the array a of length n.

I need to simulate the game for both players over k turns and see who ends up with a higher score. If their scores are equal, it's a draw.

Now, simulating the game for each player separately seems straightforward, but considering that k can be up to 10^9, I need an efficient way to compute the scores without simulating each turn individually.

Let's think about how the players move. At each turn, a player can choose to stay in their current position or move to p[x], where x is their current position. Since they're trying to maximize their scores, they'll choose the option that gives them the highest score at each step.

Wait, but they have to make the same number of moves simultaneously. So, it's not exactly that they're making choices independently; they're both playing for k turns, making decisions at each turn.

But in reality, since they make decisions simultaneously and independently, I can compute each player's optimal score separately and then compare them.

The key is to find the optimal path for each player that maximizes their score over k turns.

Given that the permutation is a cycle or a set of cycles, players can end up in cycles where p[p[...p[x]]] = x after some iterations.

I need to detect these cycles because if a player is in a cycle, their movement will repeat after a certain number of steps.

So, for each player, I need to find their cycle and determine how they can maximize their score by choosing to stay or move at each step.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's try to model it.

Let me consider Bodya first. He starts at position P_B. At each turn, he can choose to stay at his current position and get a[P_B], or move to p[P_B] and get a[p[P_B]].

Similarly, Sasha starts at P_S and has the same choices.

But since they make decisions simultaneously, and the game lasts for exactly k turns, I need to find the optimal sequence of stays and moves for each player independently.

Wait, but they make decisions simultaneously, so perhaps there's some interaction, but actually, since their choices don't affect each other's positions or scores directly, I can treat each player separately.

So, for Bodya, I need to find the maximum possible score he can achieve in k turns, given his starting position and the option to stay or move each turn.

Similarly for Sasha.

Then, compare their maximum possible scores.

If Bodya's score is higher, print "Bodya". If Sasha's is higher, print "Sasha". If equal, print "Draw".

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum score each player can achieve individually.

Now, how do I compute the maximum score for a player?

Let's consider a single player starting at position x.

At each turn, the player can choose to stay at x and get a[x], or move to p[x] and get a[p[x]].

The player can choose differently in each turn, but the choices are independent.

Wait, but the choices are not entirely independent because moving affects the next position.

So, the player has to decide at each turn whether to stay or move.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem.

Let me think about it in terms of states.

Let's define dp[i][j], where i is the current position and j is the number of turns left.

dp[i][j] represents the maximum score achievable from position i with j turns remaining.

But n can be up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, so a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider the structure of the permutation.

Since p is a permutation, it forms one or more disjoint cycles.

If I can find the cycle that each player is in, I can analyze the cycle separately.

For example, if a player is in a cycle of length m, then after m moves, they return to their starting position.

So, in terms of movement, it's cyclic.

Now, at each turn, the player can choose to stay or to move to the next position in the cycle.

The player's position after k turns depends on how many times they choose to move.

But since they can choose differently in each turn, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose to add a[x] to their score and stay, or add a[p[x]] to their score and move to p[x].

But since they can choose differently in each turn, the total score is the sum of a[x_i] for each turn, where x_i is the position they choose to be in at turn i.

But with k up to 1e9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Maybe I can precompute the optimal path for each player.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing a sequence of stays and moves, but that seems too slow.

Let me think differently.

Suppose a player is in a cycle of length m.

Then, after m moves, they return to the starting position.

So, their positions repeat every m moves.

But since they can choose to stay or move each turn, it's not exactly a simple cycle.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the possible positions the player can be in after k turns.

But that seems complicated.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player has two options: stay and get a[x], or move to p[x] and get a[p[x]].

The player can choose any combination of stays and moves over k turns.

The goal is to maximize the sum of a[x_i] over k turns.

Given that, perhaps the optimal strategy is to choose the higher of a[x] and a[p[x]] at each turn.

Wait, but if a[x] > a[p[x]], it's better to stay; otherwise, to move.

But there might be cases where moving leads to better choices in future turns.

However, since the player can choose independently each turn, maybe choosing the higher of a[x] and a[p[x]] each time is optimal.

Let me test this idea with an example.

Take the first example from the input:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3]

a = [7,2,5,6]

So, positions are 1-based.

Bodya starts at 3.

Turn 1:

- Stay at 3: get a[3]=5, position remains 3

- Move to p[3]=2: get a[2]=2, position becomes 2

Sasha starts at 2.

Turn 1:

- Stay at 2: get a[2]=2, position remains 2

- Move to p[2]=1: get a[1]=7, position becomes 1

After turn 1:

Bodya: position 3 or 2, score 5 or 2

Sasha: position 2 or 1, score 2 or 7

Turn 2:

If Bodya is at 3:

- Stay: get 5, total 10

- Move to 2: get 2, total 7

If Bodya is at 2:

- Stay: get 2, total 4

- Move to 1: get 7, total 9

If Sasha is at 2:

- Stay: get 2, total 4

- Move to 1: get 7, total 14

If Sasha is at 1:

- Stay: get 7, total 14

- Move to p[1]=4: get a[4]=6, position 4

Wait, but in the explanation, Bodya ends with 10 and Sasha with 9.

So, in this case, choosing to stay at 3 for Bodya and staying at 1 for Sasha seems optimal.

But according to my earlier idea of choosing the higher of a[x] and a[p[x]] each time, it seems to work.

For Bodya:

- At position 3, a[3]=5 > a[p[3]]=2, so stay at 3, get 5

- At position 3 again, get another 5, total 10

For Sasha:

- At position 2, a[2]=2 < a[p[2]]=7, so move to 1, get 7

- At position 1, a[1]=7 > a[p[1]]=6, so stay at 1, get another 7, total 14

Wait, but in the example, Sasha ends with 9, not 14. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the example explanation, Sasha moves to 1 in the first turn and stays at 1 in the second turn, getting 2 + 7 = 9.

But according to my earlier logic, Sasha should move to 1 in the first turn and then stay at 1 to get 7 + 7 = 14.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the example explanation or in my understanding.

Let me read the example again.

In the example:

Turn 1:

- Bodya: stays at 3, score += 5, position remains 3

- Sasha: moves to p[2]=1, score += 7, position becomes 1

Turn 2:

- Bodya: stays at 3, score += 5, total 10

- Sasha: stays at 1, score += 7, total 9

Wait, in the explanation, Sasha's total is 9, but according to the array, a[1]=7, so staying at 1 should give another 7, making it 14.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"two things happen to each player:

1. If the current position is x, score increases by a_x.

2. Then, the player either stays at x or moves to p_x."

So, in each turn:

- First, score increases by a_x.

- Then, choose to stay at x or move to p_x.

Wait, so the position for the next turn is determined after adding a_x to the score.

So, in the first turn:

- Bodya is at 3, score += a[3]=5, then chooses to stay at 3 or move to p[3]=2.

- Sasha is at 2, score += a[2]=2, then chooses to stay at 2 or move to p[2]=1.

In the second turn:

- Bodya, if he stayed at 3, score += a[3]=5 again.

- If he moved to 2, score += a[2]=2.

Similarly for Sasha.

So, in each turn, the player adds a[x] to their score and then chooses to stay or move.

In the example explanation, Sasha moves to 1 in the first turn, getting a[2]=2, then in the second turn, stays at 1, getting a[1]=7.

Total score: 2 + 7 = 9.

But according to the array, a[1]=7, so if he stays at 1, he should get a[1]=7 in the second turn.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says Sasha moves to 1 in the first turn and then stays at 1 in the second turn, getting a[2]=2 in the first turn and a[1]=7 in the second turn.

But according to the problem statement, in each turn, the score increases by a[x], where x is the current position at the start of the turn, before choosing to stay or move.

So, in the first turn:

- Sasha is at 2, score += a[2]=2, then chooses to move to p[2]=1.

- In the second turn:

- Sasha is now at 1, score += a[1]=7, then chooses to stay at 1.

Total score: 2 + 7 = 9.

But according to my earlier logic, Sasha should move to 1 in the first turn and then stay at 1, getting a[2]=2 and a[1]=7.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written that the score increases by a[x] at the start of the turn, before choosing to stay or move.

So, in the first turn:

- Sasha is at 2, score += a[2]=2, then chooses to move to p[2]=1.

- In the second turn:

- Sasha is at 1, score += a[1]=7, then chooses to stay at 1.

Total: 2 + 7 = 9.

But if Sasha chooses to stay at 1 in the second turn, he would stay at 1 and get a[1]=7, but according to the problem statement, the position is determined after choosing to stay or move.

Wait, let's read carefully:

"two things happen to each player:

- If the current position of the player is x, his score increases by a_x.

- Then, the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x."

So, in each turn:

1. Score += a[x]

2. Choose to stay at x or move to p[x]

Then, in the next turn, the player is at their new position.

So, in the first turn:

- Sasha is at 2, score += a[2]=2, then chooses to move to p[2]=1.

- In the second turn:

- Sasha is at 1, score += a[1]=7, then chooses to stay at 1.

Total score: 2 + 7 = 9.

But if Sasha chooses to stay at 1 in the second turn, he would stay at 1 and get a[1]=7 again.

Wait, no. The problem says "then the player either stays at his current position x or moves to p_x."

So, in the second turn:

- Sasha is at 1, score += a[1]=7, then chooses to stay at 1 or move to p[1]=4.

If he chooses to stay at 1, he remains at 1 for the next turn.

If he chooses to move to p[1]=4, he moves to 4.

But in the example explanation, it says Sasha moves to 1 in the first turn and then stays at 1 in the second turn, getting a[2]=2 and a[1]=7, total 9.

But according to the array, a[1]=7, so 2 + 7 = 9.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

"The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k turns."

So, in this case, Bodya has 10 and Sasha has 9, so Bodya wins.

But according to my earlier idea of choosing to stay or move based on which a[x] is higher, it seems that in this case, it's better for Sasha to move to 1 in the first turn and then stay at 1 in the second turn, getting 2 + 7 = 9.

But if Sasha chooses to move to 1 in the first turn and then stay at 1 in the second turn, getting a[2]=2 and a[1]=7, total 9.

Alternatively, if Sasha moves to 1 in the first turn and then moves to p[1]=4 in the second turn, getting a[2]=2 and a[1]=7, then moves to 4, but since it's only two turns, the score would still be 2 + 7 = 9.

Wait, no. In the second turn, after moving to 1, if he chooses to move to p[1]=4, he would get a[1]=7 and move to 4.

Then, in the second turn, his score would be a[2] + a[1] = 2 + 7 = 9.

But if he chooses to stay at 1 in the second turn, he gets a[1]=7 and stays at 1.

So, in both cases, the total score is 2 + 7 = 9.

Wait, but a[1]=7 is higher than a[4]=6, so choosing to stay at 1 would be better.

But in the example explanation, Sasha's score is 9, which matches this.

Now, in the first turn, Sasha could choose to stay at 2 or move to 1.

If he stays at 2 in the first turn, he gets a[2]=2, and remains at 2.

In the second turn, he gets a[2]=2 again, total 4.

But moving to 1 in the first turn and staying at 1 in the second turn gives him 2 + 7 = 9, which is better.

So, the optimal strategy is to move to the position with the higher a[x].

Wait, but in the first turn, Sasha moves to 1 because a[1]=7 > a[2]=2.

Then, in the second turn, he stays at 1 because a[1]=7 > a[p[1]]=a[4]=6.

So, in each turn, he chooses to move if a[p[x]] > a[x], else stay.

This seems to be a general strategy: in each turn, if a[p[x]] > a[x], move to p[x], else stay at x.

This way, in each turn, he gets the higher of a[x] and a[p[x]].

In this example, for Sasha:

Turn 1: at 2, a[2]=2 < a[p[2]]=a[1]=7, so move to 1, get 2

Turn 2: at 1, a[1]=7 > a[p[1]]=a[4]=6, so stay at 1, get 7

Total: 2 + 7 = 9

For Bodya:

Turn 1: at 3, a[3]=5 > a[p[3]]=a[2]=2, so stay at 3, get 5

Turn 2: at 3, a[3]=5 > a[p[3]]=a[2]=2, so stay at 3, get another 5

Total: 5 + 5 = 10

So, Bodya wins with 10 vs Sasha's 9.

This seems to confirm that the strategy is to, in each turn, choose to stay if a[x] >= a[p[x]], else move to p[x].

Then, in each turn, the player gets the higher of a[x] and a[p[x]].

Wait, but in Sasha's case, in the first turn, a[2]=2 < a[p[2]]=7, so he moves to 1, gets a[2]=2.

In the second turn, he's at 1, a[1]=7 > a[p[1]]=6, so he stays at 1, gets a[1]=7.

Total: 2 + 7 = 9.

But if he had stayed at 2 in the first turn, he would have gotten a[2]=2, then in the second turn, a[2]=2 again, total 4, which is worse.

So, moving to 1 in the first turn was the better choice.

Hence, this strategy seems optimal.

Similarly, for Bodya, staying at 3 in both turns gives him 5 + 5 = 10, which is better than moving to 2 and getting a[3]=5 and a[2]=2, total 7.

So, in this case, staying at 3 is better.

Hence, the general strategy is:

In each turn, if a[x] >= a[p[x]], stay at x and get a[x].

Else, move to p[x] and get a[x].

Wait, but in Sasha's case, in the first turn, a[2]=2 < a[p[2]]=7, so he moves to 1 and gets a[2]=2.

But actually, a[p[x]] is the value at the new position, which is a[1]=7, but he gets a[x] regardless of whether he stays or moves.

Wait, I think I'm confusing something here.

Let me re-express the rules clearly.

In each turn:

1. The player's score increases by a[x], where x is the current position.

2. Then, the player chooses to stay at x or move to p[x].

The position for the next turn is determined by this choice.

So, in each turn, the player gets a[x], and then decides whether to stay at x or move to p[x].

Hence, the score in each turn is a[x], and the choice affects the position for the next turn.

So, in the first turn:

- Sasha is at 2, gets a[2]=2, then chooses to move to p[2]=1.

- Bodya is at 3, gets a[3]=5, then chooses to stay at 3.

In the second turn:

- Sasha is at 1, gets a[1]=7, then chooses to stay at 1.

- Bodya is at 3, gets a[3]=5, then chooses to stay at 3.

Total scores:

- Bodya: 5 + 5 = 10

- Sasha: 2 + 7 = 9

Hence, Bodya wins.

So, the strategy is to choose, in each turn, to stay or move based on which option leads to a higher cumulative score over k turns.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where dp[x][j] represents the maximum score achievable from position x with j turns left.

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, this approach is too slow.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider the cycle structure of the permutation p.

Since p is a permutation, it consists of one or more disjoint cycles.

Each player is in one of these cycles.

I can analyze each cycle separately.

Within a cycle, the movement is cyclic.

Suppose a player is in a cycle of length m.

Then, after m moves, the player returns to the starting position.

Hence, the cycle repeats every m turns.

Given that k can be up to 1e9, I need to find a way to compute the maximum score over k turns by possibly repeating the cycle.

But since the player can choose to stay or move in each turn independently, it's not straightforward to model this with cycles.

Wait, perhaps I can model the optimal choices within one cycle and then repeat it for the number of times the cycle repeats within k turns.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider that for each position in the cycle, the player can choose to stay or move in each turn.

Given that, in a cycle of length m, the player can choose any sequence of stays and moves over k turns.

This still seems too broad.

Maybe I can think in terms of the maximum possible score per cycle and then scale it up for the number of cycles within k turns.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose a player is in a cycle of length 1, i.e., p[x] = x.

Then, the player can choose to stay at x in every turn, getting a[x] each time.

Hence, the total score is k * a[x].

Now, suppose the cycle length is 2: x -> y -> x.

Then, in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move.

For example:

Turn 1:

- Stay at x: get a[x], remain at x

- Move to y: get a[x], move to y

Turn 2:

- If stayed at x in turn 1:

- Stay at x: get a[x], remain at x

- Move to y: get a[x], move to y

- If moved to y in turn 1:

- Stay at y: get a[y], remain at y

- Move to x: get a[y], move to x

And so on.

In this case, the player can choose different options each turn, leading to different sequences.

To maximize the score, the player should choose, in each turn, to stay if a[x] >= a[p[x]], else move.

Wait, but in the earlier example, this seemed to work.

Let me test this strategy.

Take the cycle x -> y -> x.

Case 1: a[x] >= a[y]

Then, in each turn, it's better to stay at x and get a[x].

Hence, total score is k * a[x].

Case 2: a[x] < a[y]

Then, in the first turn, it's better to move to y, get a[x].

In the second turn, at y:

- Stay at y: get a[y]

- Move to x: get a[y]

Since a[y] > a[x], it's better to stay at y.

Hence, total score is a[x] + (k-1) * a[y]

Wait, but in the first turn, moving to y gives a[x], and then staying at y for the remaining k-1 turns gives (k-1) * a[y].

Hence, total score is a[x] + (k-1) * a[y]

But, alternatively, if the player moves to y in the first turn and then moves back to x in the second turn, getting a[x] + a[y], and so on.

But in this case, staying at y seems better if a[y] > a[x].

Hence, the earlier strategy seems to hold.

Now, generalizing this to longer cycles.

Suppose a cycle is x -> y ->
