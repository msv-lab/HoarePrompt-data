Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's break it down. Gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b. So, b * gcd(a, b) is b multiplied by that gcd. The condition is that a + b is divisible by this product.

I think it would help to express this condition in terms of divisibility. So, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b), which means that there exists some integer k such that a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify this condition.

Let me consider the properties of gcd. I know that gcd(a, b) divides both a and b. So, I can write a = x * gcd(a, b) and b = y * gcd(a, b), where x and y are integers that are coprime (their gcd is 1).

Substituting these into the condition:

a + b = x * gcd(a, b) + y * gcd(a, b) = (x + y) * gcd(a, b)

And b * gcd(a, b) = y * gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, b) = y * (gcd(a, b))^2

So, the condition becomes that (x + y) * gcd(a, b) is divisible by y * (gcd(a, b))^2.

Simplifying, we can divide both numerator and denominator by gcd(a, b):

So, (x + y) is divisible by y * gcd(a, b).

But wait, x and y are coprime, since gcd(x, y) = 1.

Hmm, maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let's consider the ratio (a + b) / (b * gcd(a, b)). This should be an integer according to the problem.

Substituting a = x * gcd(a, b) and b = y * gcd(a, b):

(a + b) / (b * gcd(a, b)) = (x * gcd(a, b) + y * gcd(a, b)) / (y * gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, b)) = (x + y) / (y * gcd(a, b))

For this to be an integer, y * gcd(a, b) should divide (x + y).

But since x and y are coprime, y divides x + y implies that y divides x, but since y and x are coprime, y can only divide x if y = 1.

Wait, that seems off. If y divides x + y and gcd(x, y) = 1, then y divides x, which implies y = 1.

So, does this mean that y must be 1? If y is 1, then the condition holds.

But wait, let's check with an example.

Take a = 1, b = 1.

gcd(1,1) = 1.

a + b = 2.

b * gcd(a,b) = 1 * 1 = 1.

2 is divisible by 1, so it's valid.

Another example: a = 2, b = 1.

gcd(2,1) = 1.

a + b = 3.

b * gcd(a,b) = 1 * 1 = 1.

3 is divisible by 1, so valid.

a = 2, b = 2.

gcd(2,2) = 2.

a + b = 4.

b * gcd(a,b) = 2 * 2 = 4.

4 is divisible by 4, so valid.

a = 3, b = 1.

gcd(3,1) = 1.

a + b = 4.

b * gcd(a,b) = 1 * 1 = 1.

4 is divisible by 1, so valid.

a = 3, b = 3.

gcd(3,3) = 3.

a + b = 6.

b * gcd(a,b) = 3 * 3 = 9.

6 is not divisible by 9, so invalid.

Wait, but according to the problem, in the first test case with n=1, m=1, only (1,1) is valid, which matches.

In the fourth test case with n=10, m=8, the valid pairs are listed, and I can see that for example (10,2) is valid.

Let me check that:

a=10, b=2.

gcd(10,2)=2.

a + b = 12.

b * gcd(a,b) = 2 * 2 = 4.

12 is divisible by 4, so valid.

Now, from the earlier analysis, I'm not sure if y must be 1, because in the case of (10,2), y=2, which is greater than 1, and it's still valid.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Let me try to find a general condition.

Let's consider that a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a,b).

Which means that b * gcd(a,b) divides a + b.

Expressed differently, b * gcd(a,b) | a + b.

I can write this as a + b ≡ 0 mod (b * gcd(a,b)).

But perhaps it's better to express a and b in terms of their gcd.

Let d = gcd(a,b).

Then a = d * x and b = d * y, where gcd(x,y) = 1.

Substituting into the condition:

d * x + d * y ≡ 0 mod (d * y * d)

Which simplifies to d * (x + y) ≡ 0 mod (d^2 * y)

Dividing both sides by d (since d > 0):

x + y ≡ 0 mod (d * y)

So, d * y divides x + y.

But x and y are coprime, so y divides x + y implies y divides x, but since y and x are coprime, y must be 1.

Wait, but earlier examples show that y can be greater than 1 and still satisfy the condition.

For example, in (10,2), d=2, x=5, y=1.

Wait, if a=10 and b=2, then d=2, x=5, y=1.

Wait, y=1 in this case.

Wait, b=2, d=2, so y=1.

Wait, but in the earlier example, b=2, d=2, y=1.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, a=10, b=2, d=2.

Then x = a/d = 5, y = b/d = 1.

So y=1.

Wait, but in the pair (6,3), which is included in the fourth test case, a=6, b=3, d=3, x=2, y=1.

Again, y=1.

Wait, in the pair (6,2), a=6, b=2, d=2, x=3, y=1.

Again, y=1.

Wait, in the pair (6,1), a=6, b=1, d=1, x=6, y=1.

Again, y=1.

Wait, in (4,1), d=1, x=4, y=1.

Same for (3,1), (2,1), (1,1).

In all these cases, y=1.

Wait, but in (10,2), d=2, y=1; (10,1), d=1, y=1.

So in all valid pairs, y=1.

Wait, but y = b / d.

So y = b / gcd(a,b).

In all valid pairs, y=1.

Which implies that b = gcd(a,b).

Which means that b divides a.

So, b divides a.

Therefore, a is a multiple of b.

Wait, that's interesting.

So, perhaps the condition simplifies to b divides a.

Because if b divides a, then gcd(a,b)=b, since b divides a.

Then, b * gcd(a,b) = b * b = b^2.

And a + b needs to be divisible by b^2.

But a is a multiple of b, so a = k * b for some integer k.

Then, a + b = k * b + b = (k + 1) * b.

This needs to be divisible by b^2, so (k + 1) * b ≡ 0 mod b^2.

Which implies that (k + 1) * b is divisible by b^2, which means that (k + 1) is divisible by b.

So, b divides (k + 1).

But a = k * b, so a / b = k.

So, b divides (a / b + 1).

Wait, that seems messy.

Let me think differently.

If b divides a, then a = k * b for some integer k.

Then, a + b = k * b + b = (k + 1) * b.

We need (k + 1) * b to be divisible by b * gcd(a, b) = b * b, since gcd(a, b) = b.

So, (k + 1) * b ≡ 0 mod b^2.

Which means that (k + 1) is divisible by b.

Because we can cancel b from both sides (since b > 0).

So, k + 1 is divisible by b.

But k = a / b, which is an integer since b divides a.

So, k is an integer, and k + 1 is divisible by b.

Therefore, for each b, k must be such that k + 1 is a multiple of b.

Given that a = k * b, and 1 ≤ a ≤ n, which implies 1 ≤ k * b ≤ n.

So, k can range from ceil(1 / b) to floor(n / b).

But since k is an integer, k ranges from max(1, ceil(1 / b)) to floor(n / b).

But ceil(1 / b) is 1 for b >=1, so k ranges from 1 to floor(n / b).

Now, for each b, we need k such that k + 1 is divisible by b.

That is, k ≡ -1 mod b.

Given that k ranges from 1 to floor(n / b).

So, for each b, the number of k's that satisfy k ≡ -1 mod b and 1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n / b).

This is equivalent to finding the number of integers k in [1, floor(n / b)] such that k ≡ b - 1 mod b (since -1 mod b is b - 1).

So, for each b, the number of k in [1, floor(n / b)] where k ≡ b - 1 mod b.

This is a standard problem in number theory.

The number of such k's is floor((floor(n / b) - (b - 1)) / b) + 1, provided that b - 1 <= floor(n / b).

Wait, more precisely, the number of solutions to k ≡ b - 1 mod b in [1, floor(n / b)] is floor((floor(n / b) - (b - 1)) / b) + 1, if b - 1 <= floor(n / b), else 0.

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to compute this.

Alternatively, since for each b, a must be a multiple of b, and k = a / b must satisfy k ≡ -1 mod b.

So, a = k * b, with k ≡ -1 mod b.

Which means a ≡ -b mod b^2.

Wait, let's see.

Since a = k * b and k ≡ -1 mod b, then a = k * b ≡ -b mod b^2.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to iterate over b from 1 to m, and for each b, find the number of a in [1, n] where a is a multiple of b and (a + b) is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

But since we've established that gcd(a, b) = b when b divides a, this simplifies to b * b divides a + b.

And a = k * b, so a + b = k * b + b = b(k + 1).

So, b(k + 1) is divisible by b^2, which means k + 1 is divisible by b.

Therefore, for each b, the number of k where k ≡ -1 mod b and 1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n / b).

This is the same as the number of k where k ≡ b - 1 mod b in the range [1, floor(n / b)].

The number of such k is floor((floor(n / b) - (b - 1)) / b) + 1, if b - 1 <= floor(n / b), else 0.

But this seems a bit complicated to implement efficiently, especially given the constraints.

Given that n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and t (number of test cases) up to 10^4, with the sum of n and m over all test cases up to 2*10^6, we need an efficient way to compute this.

Perhaps there's a better mathematical approach.

Let me consider fixing b and finding for each b, the number of a's that satisfy the condition.

As established, a must be a multiple of b, and k = a / b must satisfy k ≡ -1 mod b.

So, a = b * k, where k ≡ -1 mod b.

Which means k = b * t - 1 for some integer t >= 1.

Because k >=1, since a >=1.

So, a = b * (b * t - 1) = b^2 * t - b.

We need 1 ≤ a ≤ n, which translates to 1 ≤ b^2 * t - b ≤ n.

So, 1 ≤ b^2 * t - b implies b^2 * t - b >=1, so t >= ceil((b + 1)/ b^2).

And b^2 * t - b <= n implies t <= floor((n + b)/ b^2).

So, for each b, t ranges from ceil((b + 1)/ b^2) to floor((n + b)/ b^2).

But this seems complicated to compute for each b.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider small values of b and see if I can find a pattern.

Take b=1:

Then, a can be from 1 to n, since b=1 divides all a.

And a + b = a + 1, which needs to be divisible by b * gcd(a, b) =1 * gcd(a,1)=1.

Since anything is divisible by 1, all a from 1 to n are valid.

So, for b=1, there are n valid a's.

Take b=2:

a must be a multiple of 2, say a=2k.

Then, a + b =2k +2=2(k+1), which needs to be divisible by b * gcd(a,b)=2 * 2=4.

So, 2(k+1) divisible by 4 implies that k+1 is divisible by 2.

So, k is odd.

Therefore, a=2*(2t -1)=4t -2, for t>=1.

We need 1 ≤ 4t -2 ≤n.

So, t >= ceil(3/4)=1, and t <= floor((n+2)/4).

So, number of t's is floor((n+2)/4) - floor(2/4)=floor((n+2)/4).

But floor(2/4)=0, so floor((n+2)/4).

Wait, for n=10 and b=2, floor((10+2)/4)=3.

So, t=1,2,3 corresponding to a=2,6,10.

Which matches the fourth test case.

Similarly, for b=3:

a must be a multiple of 3, a=3k.

a + b=3k +3=3(k+1), which needs to be divisible by b * gcd(a,b)=3 * 3=9.

So, 3(k+1) divisible by 9 implies k+1 divisible by 3.

So, k ≡ 2 mod 3.

Thus, k=3t -1.

a=3*(3t -1)=9t -3.

1 ≤ 9t -3 ≤n.

t >= ceil(4/9)=1, t <= floor((n+3)/9).

So, number of t's is floor((n+3)/9) - floor(3/9)=floor((n+3)/9) - 0.

For n=10, floor((10+3)/9)=1.

So, t=1, a=6.

Which matches the fourth test case.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, (3,1),(6,3),(9,3) are included.

Wait, but for b=3, a=3,6,9.

For a=3, b=3: a + b=6, b * gcd(a,b)=3 * 3=9, 6 is not divisible by 9. So, invalid.

Wait, but earlier I thought a=9t -3, but for t=1, a=6, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, for b=3, a=3k, with k ≡ 2 mod 3.

So, k=3t -1.

a=3*(3t -1)=9t -3.

For t=1, a=6.

For t=2, a=15, which is greater than n=10.

So, only a=6 is valid.

But in the fourth test case, (3,3) is included, but according to this, it should not be.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine.

Wait, for b=3, a must be a multiple of 3, and k ≡ -1 mod 3, which is k ≡ 2 mod 3.

So, a=3*(3t -1)=9t -3.

For t=1, a=6.

For t=2, a=15, which is greater than n=10.

So, only a=6 is valid for b=3.

But in the fourth test case, (3,3) is listed as valid, but according to this, it should not be.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Let me check for a=3, b=3.

gcd(3,3)=3.

a + b=6.

b * gcd(a,b)=3*3=9.

6 is not divisible by 9, so it should not be valid.

But in the test case, it's included.

Wait, perhaps the test case is incorrect, or maybe I misread it.

Wait, looking back at the fourth test case, the valid pairs are:

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

Looking at (6,3), which should be valid as per earlier analysis, since a=6, b=3, a + b=9, b * gcd(a,b)=9, 9 is divisible by 9.

Similarly, (10,2): a=10, b=2, a + b=12, b * gcd(a,b)=4, 12 is divisible by 4.

And (3,1): a=3, b=1, a + b=4, b * gcd(a,b)=1, 4 is divisible by 1.

So, seems like only b=1 and b=2 are present in the valid pairs for n=10, m=8.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, m=8, so b can be up to 8.

But according to my earlier analysis, for b=3, only a=6 is valid.

But in the test case, (3,1),(6,3),(9,3) are included, but (9,3) should not be valid because a=9, b=3, a + b=12, b * gcd(a,b)=9, 12 is not divisible by 9.

Wait, 12 is not divisible by 9, so it should not be valid.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the test case.

Wait, maybe I misread the test case.

Looking back, in the note, it says:

"In the fourth test case,

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

satisfy the conditions."

Wait, in this list, (6,3) is included, but according to my calculation, it should not be.

Wait, a=6, b=3:

a + b=9, b * gcd(a,b)=3 * 3=9, 9 is divisible by 9, so it is valid.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Yes, 9 is divisible by 9, so it is valid.

So, for b=3, a=6 is valid.

Similarly, for b=3, a=9 would also be valid if n >=9.

But in n=10, m=8, b=3 is allowed.

Wait, but in general, for b fixed, a must be a multiple of b, and k=(a/b) must satisfy k ≡ -1 mod b.

So, a = b * (b * t -1) = b^2 * t - b.

With 1 ≤ b^2 * t - b ≤ n.

So, t >= ceil((b +1)/ b^2), and t <= floor((n + b)/ b^2).

Then, the number of t's is floor((n + b)/ b^2) - ceil((b +1)/ b^2) +1.

But ceil((b +1)/ b^2) can be simplified.

Since b >=1, b^2 >= b, so (b +1)/ b^2 <=2/b, which is <=2 for b>=1.

So, ceil((b +1)/ b^2) is 1 for b >=1.

Therefore, the number of t's is floor((n + b)/ b^2) -1.

But need to ensure that floor((n + b)/ b^2) >=1.

So, for each b from 1 to m, the number of valid a's is floor((n + b)/ b^2) -1, if floor((n + b)/ b^2) >=1, else 0.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=10, m=8, let's compute for b=1 to 8.

For b=1: floor((10 +1)/1)=11-1=10.

For b=2: floor((10 +2)/4)=12/4=3-1=2.

Wait, but earlier I had 3 valid a's for b=2: a=2,6,10.

So, floor((10 +2)/4)=3, then 3-1=2, but should be 3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, generalizing from earlier, for b=1, a=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: 10 a's.

For b=2, a=2,4,6,8,10: but only a=2,6,10 are valid, which is 3 a's.

According to floor((10 +2)/4)-1=3-1=2, but should be 3.

So, perhaps the formula is floor((n + b)/ b^2), without subtracting 1.

Wait, for b=1: floor((10 +1)/1)=11, which is more than n, so need to cap it at n.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is min(n / b, floor((n + b)/ b^2)).

Wait, need to think carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid a's for each b is floor((n + b)/ b^2).

Because a = b^2 * t - b <=n.

So, b^2 * t - b <=n => t <= (n + b)/ b^2.

So, t <= floor((n + b)/ b^2).

And t >=1.

So, number of t's is floor((n + b)/ b^2) -0, but need to ensure t >=1.

Wait, t starts from 1.

So, number of t's is floor((n + b)/ b^2).

But in the earlier example, for b=2, floor((10 +2)/4)=3, which matches the number of valid a's: a=2,6,10.

Similarly, for b=3, floor((10 +3)/9)=1, which is a=6.

For b=1, floor((10 +1)/1)=11, but actually there are n=10 a's.

Wait, because for b=1, a=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But according to floor((n + b)/ b^2), floor(11/1)=11, which is more than n.

So, need to take min(floor((n + b)/ b^2), floor(n / b)).

Wait, but for b=1, floor(n / b)=10.

So, min(11,10)=10, which matches.

For b=2, floor(n / b)=5, floor((n + b)/ b^2)=3.

So, min(5,3)=3, which matches.

For b=3, floor(n / b)=3, floor((n + b)/ b^2)=1.

So, min(3,1)=1, which matches.

For b=4, floor(n / b)=2, floor((n + b)/ b^2)= floor(14/16)=0.

So, min(2,0)=0.

Similarly for higher b, it will be 0.

So, seems like the number of valid a's for each b is min(floor(n / b), floor((n + b)/ b^2)).

But in the earlier calculation, floor((n + b)/ b^2) was sufficient, as for b=1, floor((n + b)/ b^2)=n +1, which needs to be capped at floor(n / b)=n.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((n + b)/ b^2).

But in the case of b=1, floor((n +1)/1)=n +1, but we need to cap it at n.

So, perhaps the correct formula is min(floor(n / b), floor((n + b)/ b^2)).

But in the code provided, it seems different.

Looking at the given code:

def func_1():

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

ans = n

root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1

for i in range(2, root + 1):

cnt = i * i

ans += (n + i) // cnt

print(ans)

So, it reads n and k (which should be m), initializes ans = n, then iterates from i=2 to sqrt(n)+1, computes cnt = i*i, and adds (n + i) // cnt to ans.

Finally, prints ans.

Wait, but in the problem, m is up to 2*10^6, and n is up to 2*10^6.

In the code, it seems that only n is considered in the loop, not m.

Wait, but in the problem, we need to consider b from 1 to m.

But in the code, it seems to be iterating over some i from 2 to sqrt(n)+1, and adding (n + i) // (i*i).

Then, ans starts with n, which perhaps corresponds to b=1.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the sum over b from 1 to m of floor((n + b)/ (b*b)).

But in the code, it only goes up to b=sqrt(n), or something like that.

Wait, let's see.

It sets ans = n, which might correspond to b=1.

Then, it iterates i from 2 to sqrt(n)+1, computes cnt = i*i, and adds (n + i) // cnt to ans.

So, it's summing floor((n + i)/ (i*i)) for i from 2 to sqrt(n)+1.

But in the problem, b can be up to m, which is up to 2*10^6.

But in the code, it only goes up to i=sqrt(n)+1, which is up to around 1415 for n=2*10^6.

So, it's not considering b beyond sqrt(n).

But in the problem, m can be up to 2*10^6, which is much larger than sqrt(n).

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example with n=10, m=8, the correct answer is 14, and according to the code:

ans = n =10

Then, i from 2 to sqrt(10)+1=4

So, i=2, cnt=4, (10 +2)/4=12/4=3, ans +=3

ans=13

i=3, cnt=9, (10 +3)/9=13/9=1, ans +=1

ans=14

i=4, cnt=16, (10 +4)/16=14/16=0, ans +=0

Final ans=14, which matches the fourth test case.

But in this case, m=8, which is greater than sqrt(n)=sqrt(10)=~3.16.

But in the code, it only iterates up to sqrt(n)+1=4, which is less than m=8.

But in the code, it seems to produce the correct answer for this test case.

Wait, perhaps there is a mathematical insight that allows summing up to b=sqrt(n).

Let me think about it.

Suppose we fix b, and consider the term floor((n + b)/ (b*b)).

For b >= sqrt(n), b*b >= n, so (n + b)/ (b*b) < (n + b)/n < 2/n, which for b >= sqrt(n), is less than 2/n, which for n >=1 is less than or equal to 2.

So, floor((n + b)/ (b*b)) is either 0 or 1 for b >= sqrt(n).

But in the code, it only iterates up to b=sqrt(n), or something like that.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, m=8, which is greater than sqrt(n)=sqrt(10), but the code only iterates up to i=sqrt(n)+1=4, which is less than m=8.

But in the test case, it seems to produce the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I need to look deeper.

Wait, in the code, it sets ans = n, which corresponds to b=1.

Then, it iterates i from 2 to sqrt(n)+1, and adds floor((n + i)/ (i*i)).

But in the problem, b can be up to m, which is up to 2*10^6.

But in the code, it only iterates up to i=sqrt(n)+1, which is up to around 1415 for n=2*10^6.

But m can be up to 2*10^6, which is much larger.

So, it seems that the code is incomplete or incorrect because it doesn't consider b > sqrt(n).

But in the test case with n=10, m=8, it produces the correct answer of 14.

Wait, perhaps for b > sqrt(n), floor((n + b)/ (b*b)) is always 0 or 1, and in some cases, it's already accounted for.

Wait, let's consider b > sqrt(n).

For b > sqrt(n), b*b > n.

So, (n + b)/ (b*b) < (n + b)/n < 1 + b/n.

But since b > sqrt(n), and n >=1, b/n < sqrt(n).

So, (n + b)/ (b*b) < 1 + b/n < 1 + sqrt(n)/n =1 + 1/sqrt(n).

For n >=1, 1 + 1/sqrt(n) <=2.

So, floor((n + b)/ (b*b)) is either 0 or 1.

Specifically, (n + b)/ (b*b) >= (b)/ (b*b) =1/b.

For b >=2, 1/b <=0.5, so (n + b)/ (b*b) <1 +0.5=1.5.

So, floor((n + b)/ (b*b)) is either 0 or 1.

But in the code, it only sums up to i=sqrt(n)+1, which corresponds to b=i.

But for b > sqrt(n), floor((n + b)/ (b*b)) is either 0 or 1, but the code doesn't account for b from sqrt(n)+1 to m.

So, perhaps there is a way to compute the sum efficiently up to b=m.

Wait, maybe the code is missing the part where b > sqrt(n).

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mathematical formula that allows computing this sum efficiently.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct because for b > sqrt(n), floor((n + b)/ (b*b)) is 0 or 1, and in the sum, it's already accounted for in ans.

Wait, in the code, ans is initialized to n, which corresponds to b=1.

Then, it adds floor((n + i)/ (i*i)) for i from 2 to sqrt(n)+1.

But what about b from sqrt(n)+1 to m?

Wait, perhaps for b > sqrt(n), floor((n + b)/ (b*b)) is 0 or 1, and the code doesn't account for b > sqrt(n).

But in the test case with m=8 and n=10, sqrt(n)+1=4, so b from 5 to 8 are not considered in the loop.

But in the test case, the answer is 14, which matches the sum of floor((n + b)/ (b*b)) for b from 1 to 4, which is 10 +3 +1 +0 =14.

But in reality, for b=5 to 8, floor((10 + b)/ (b*b)):

b=5: floor(15/25)=0

b=6: floor(16/36)=0

b=7: floor(17/49)=0

b=8: floor(18/64)=0

So, for b=5 to 8, floor((n + b)/ (b*b))=0.

Therefore, in this case, summing up to b=4 is sufficient.

Similarly, for larger n and m, if for b > sqrt(n), floor((n + b)/ (b*b))=0, then summing up to b=sqrt(n) would be sufficient.

Let me check for n=100, m=1233.

For b > sqrt(100)=10, b from 11 to 1233, floor((100 + b)/ (b*b)).

For b=11: floor(111/121)=0

b=12: floor(112/144)=0

...

b=100: floor(200/10000)=0

...

b=1233: floor(1333/1520289)=0

So, for b >10, floor((100 + b)/ (b*b))=0.

Hence, summing up to b=10 is sufficient.

Similarly, for n=1000000, m=1145141.

sqrt(n)=1000.

For b >1000, b from 1001 to 1145141, floor((1000000 + b)/ (b*b)).

For b=1001: floor(1001001/1002001)=0

...

For larger b, it's 0.

Hence, summing up to b=sqrt(n)=1000 is sufficient.

Therefore, in general, for b > sqrt(n), floor((n + b)/ (b*b))=0.

Hence, summing up to b=sqrt(n) is sufficient.

Therefore, the code seems correct.

Wait, but in the code, it sets ans = n, which corresponds to b=1.

Then, it iterates i from 2 to sqrt(n)+1, computes cnt = i*i, and adds (n + i) // cnt to ans.

This corresponds to summing floor((n + b)/ (b*b)) for b from 1 to sqrt(n).

But in reality, for b=1 to sqrt(n), floor((n + b)/ (b*b)), and for b > sqrt(n), floor((n + b)/ (b*b))=0.

Hence, summing up to b=sqrt(n) is sufficient.

Therefore, the code seems correct.

But in the problem, m can be up to 2*10^6, but in the code, it only considers b up to sqrt(n).

But as we've seen, for b > sqrt(n), floor((n + b)/ (b*b))=0, so it's okay to stop at b=sqrt(n).

Hence, the code is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: True

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \times \gcd(a, b)\). 

### Approach

1. **Insight into the Condition**:
    - We need \(a + b\) to be divisible by \(b \times \gcd(a, b)\).
    - By expressing \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(\gcd(a, b)\), we can simplify this condition.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**:
    - Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then, \(a = d \times x\) and \(b = d \times y\), where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
    - Substituting, the condition becomes \(d(x + y)\) divisible by \(d \times y \times d\), which simplifies to \(x + y\) divisible by \(d \times y\).
    - Given that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, \(y\) must divide \(x + y\), implying \(y\) divides \(x\). Since \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, \(y\) must be 1.
    - Hence, \(b = d \times y = d \times 1 = d\), meaning \(b = \gcd(a, b)\), so \(b\) divides \(a\).

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
    - For each \(b\), \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) and lie in \([1, n]\).
    - Additionally, \(\frac{a}{b} + 1\) must be divisible by \(b\).
    - This translates to counting \(k\) such that \(a = k \times b\) and \(k \times b + b\) is divisible by \(b^2\), which simplifies to \(k + 1\) divisible by \(b\).

4. **Efficient Calculation**:
    - For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), compute the number of valid \(a\) using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\).
    - Sum these values for all \(b\) from 1 to \(\min(m, \sqrt{n})\) since for \(b > \sqrt{n}\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor = 0\).

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n  # Contribution from b=1
    root = int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1  # Integer square root of n
    for b in range(2, root):
        if b > m:
            break
        cnt = b * b
        ans += (n + b) // cnt
    print(ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
    - Read the number of test cases \( t \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - For each test case, read \( n \) and \( m \).
    - Initialize `ans` to \( n \) to account for \( b = 1 \).
    - Compute the integer square root of \( n \) to limit the iteration for \( b \).

3. **Loop for \( b \) from 2 to \(\sqrt{n}\)**:
    - For each \( b \), compute \( cnt = b^2 \).
    - Add \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{cnt} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.
    - Break the loop if \( b \) exceeds \( m \).

4. **Output the Result**:
    - Print the accumulated `ans` for each test case.

This approach ensures efficient computation within the constraints, leveraging mathematical insights to reduce complexity.
