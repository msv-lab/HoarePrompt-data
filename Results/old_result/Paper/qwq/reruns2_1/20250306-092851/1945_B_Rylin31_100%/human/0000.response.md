Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are two firework installations. The first one launches fireworks every 'a' minutes, and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework is visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after launch, meaning from time x to x + m inclusive.

I need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible.

Let's consider the launch times:

- Installation 1: launches at a, 2a, 3a, ..., ka, etc.

- Installation 2: launches at b, 2b, 3b, ..., lb, etc.

Each firework launched at time t is visible from t to t + m.

So, for any given time t, I need to count how many fireworks from both installations are visible at that time.

I need to find the time t where this count is maximized.

Now, considering that a and b could be different, and m can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to calculate this.

Let me think about the possible overlaps.

For installation 1, the visible times are:

- [a, a + m]

- [2a, 2a + m]

- [3a, 3a + m]

- ...

Similarly for installation 2:

- [b, b + m]

- [2b, 2b + m]

- [3b, 3b + m]

- ...

I need to find a time t where the number of intervals from both installations that contain t is maximized.

This sounds like a problem of interval overlapping.

But with a and b possibly being large, and m up to 10^18, I need a smart way to compute this without iterating through all possible times.

Let me consider the launch times and see how they align.

If a and b are co-prime, their launch times won't overlap unless at multiples of a*b.

But m can be large, so there might be overlaps in visibility.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

The LCM of a and b is the time when both installations launch simultaneously.

But actually, since they start at the same time, if a and b have a common factor, their launch times will overlap at multiples of the LCM.

Wait, no, if a and b are different, their launch times will only coincide at multiples of LCM(a, b), but since a and b can be up to 10^18, LCM could be very large.

But m can be up to 10^18 as well.

Hmm.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a time t, and I want to know how many fireworks are visible at that time from both installations.

For installation 1, the number of launches that are still visible at time t is the number of k such that ka <= t <= ka + m, which is equivalent to (t - m)/a <= k <= t/a.

Similarly for installation 2: (t - m)/b <= l <= t/b.

So, for each installation, the number of visible fireworks at time t is floor(t/a) - ceil((t - m)/a), and similarly for b.

But ceil((t - m)/a) can be written as floor((t - m - 1)/a) + 1.

So, the number of visible fireworks from installation 1 is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a).

Similarly for installation 2.

Therefore, the total number of visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to maximize this sum.

Now, I need to find t such that this sum is maximized.

Given that m can be up to 10^18, and a and b can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that floor(t/x) - floor((t - m - 1)/x) is equal to the number of multiples of x in the interval [t - m, t].

Wait, actually, floor(t/x) - floor((t - m - 1)/x) gives the number of multiples of x in the range [t - m + 1, t].

Wait, let's verify:

For installation 1, the number of launches between t - m and t is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a).

Wait, more precisely, the number of k where ka <= t and ka >= t - m is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a).

Similarly for installation 2.

So, total visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to maximize this sum.

Now, to maximize this sum, I need to choose t such that both floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) and floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b) are maximized.

But since a and b could be different, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider that for a given t, the number of visible fireworks from installation 1 is the number of launches in the last m minutes.

So, it's ceil(m / a) for installation 1, but not exactly, because it depends on how t aligns with the launch times.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that for installation 1, the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + 1, because m / a gives the number of full periods in m, plus one for the partial period.

Similarly for installation 2.

But actually, it could be higher if the launches align in such a way that multiple launches are within the visibility period.

Wait, no, floor(m / a) + 1 is the maximum number of launches that can be visible at any time for installation 1.

Because if t is such that t mod a is small, more launches will be visible.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, the maximum for installation 1 is floor(m / a) + 1, and for installation 2 is floor(m / b) + 1.

Therefore, the maximum total is floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

But wait, in the example, a=6, b=7, m=4.

floor(4/6)=0, floor(4/7)=0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches the first sample output.

In the second sample, a=3, b=4, m=10.

floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/4)=2, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which matches the second sample output.

In the third sample, a=7, b=8, m=56.

floor(56/7)=8, floor(56/8)=7, so 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches the third sample.

In the fourth sample, a=5, b=6, m=78123459896.

floor(78123459896/5)=15624691979, floor(78123459896/6)=13020576649, so 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630, which matches the fourth sample.

In the fifth sample, a=1, b=1, m=1.

floor(1/1)=1, floor(1/1)=1, so 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which matches the fifth sample.

In the sixth sample, a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000.

floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, so 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sixth sample.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 gives the correct maximum number of visible fireworks.

Therefore, the program is correct.
