Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the four corners of a square in random order, and I need to find the area of the square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed that the coordinates provided form such a square with positive area.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligned with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should reflect that alignment.

Given that, let's think about how the coordinates of the four corners would look. For a square with sides parallel to the axes, the x-coordinates of the vertical sides would be the same, and the y-coordinates of the horizontal sides would be the same.

For example, if one side is from (x1, y1) to (x1, y2), and another side is from (x2, y1) to (x2, y2), then the square's sides are parallel to the axes.

Now, the problem is that the coordinates are given in random order, so I can't assume any particular ordering. I need a way to process these four points and determine the area of the square they form.

One approach could be to sort the coordinates in some way to identify opposite corners or adjacent corners.

Let me consider sorting the coordinates based on their x and y values.

If I sort the points by their x-coordinates, I can identify the minimum and maximum x-values, which would correspond to the leftmost and rightmost points of the square.

Similarly, sorting by y-coordinates would give me the bottommost and topmost points.

But since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values should be equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values, and that would give me the side length of the square.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if I take the max x - min x and max y - min y, and since it's a square, these two differences should be equal.

Then, the area would simply be (max x - min x)^2, or equivalently (max y - min y)^2.

But, in the given code, it seems to be doing something different. Let's look at the code provided.

The code defines a function func(), and it seems to handle multiple test cases, as indicated by the input n = int(input()), and then a loop while n: that runs for each test case.

For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers, which are the coordinates of the four corners.

It stores these coordinates in a list called coord.

Then, it sorts the coord list. Since it's a list of tuples, sorting it will arrange the points in order of increasing x-coordinate, and for points with the same x-coordinate, in order of increasing y-coordinate.

After sorting, it calculates two values p1 and p2, which seem to be the squared distances between certain pairs of points.

Specifically, p1 is the squared distance between coord[1] and coord[0], and p2 is the squared distance between coord[3] and coord[2].

Then, it calculates the area as the absolute value of the product of the square roots of p1 and p2.

Wait, that seems unnecessary complicated. If it's a square with sides parallel to the axes, why calculate distances between arbitrary points?

Let me think about what p1 and p2 represent.

Given that the points are sorted, coord[0] should be the point with the smallest x-coordinate, and coord[3] should be the point with the largest x-coordinate.

Assuming that the sorting orders the points from left to right and bottom to top, coord[0] and coord[1] might be the leftmost points, with coord[0] being the bottom-left and coord[1] being the top-left.

Similarly, coord[2] and coord[3] might be the rightmost points, with coord[2] being the bottom-right and coord[3] being the top-right.

If that's the case, then the distance between coord[1] and coord[0] should be the height of the square, and the distance between coord[3] and coord[2] should also be the height of the square.

Similarly, the distance between coord[0] and coord[2] should be the width of the square.

But in this code, it's calculating p1 as the squared distance between coord[1] and coord[0], and p2 as the squared distance between coord[3] and coord[2], then taking the square roots and multiplying them to get the area.

Wait, but in a square, the height and width are equal, so multiplying them would give the area.

But this seems like an overcomplicated way to calculate the area, especially since it's guaranteed that the points form a square with sides parallel to the axes.

A simpler way would be to find the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, and the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates, and since it's a square, those differences should be equal, and the area would be the square of that difference.

In fact, in this code, by sorting the coordinates, coord[0] should have the smallest x, and coord[3] should have the largest x.

Similarly, among coord[0] and coord[1], which have the two smallest x-values, coord[0] should have the smaller y, and coord[1] should have the larger y.

Similarly, among coord[2] and coord[3], which have the two largest x-values, coord[2] should have the smaller y, and coord[3] should have the larger y.

Therefore, the difference in y-coordinates between coord[1] and coord[0] should be equal to the difference in y-coordinates between coord[3] and coord[2], and that should be equal to the difference in x-coordinates between coord[2] and coord[0].

But in the code, it's calculating p1 and p2 as squared distances, then taking their square roots and multiplying them to get the area.

This should work because p1 is (delta_x)^2 + (delta_y)^2 between coord[1] and coord[0], and p2 is (delta_x)^2 + (delta_y)^2 between coord[3] and coord[2].

But in this arrangement, delta_x between coord[1] and coord[0] should be 0 (since they have the same x-coordinate), and delta_y is the height of the square.

Similarly, delta_x between coord[3] and coord[2] is 0, and delta_y is the height of the square.

Therefore, p1 = 0 + (y1 - y0)^2, and p2 = 0 + (y3 - y2)^2.

Then, sqrt(p1) = |y1 - y0|, and sqrt(p2) = |y3 - y2|.

Assuming the square's sides are parallel to the axes, these should both be equal to the side length of the square.

Therefore, res = |y1 - y0| * |y3 - y2|, which would be side_length * side_length = area.

So, in this specific arrangement, the code correctly calculates the area.

But let's verify this with the sample input.

Take the first test case:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

Sorting these points:

(1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

So, coord[0] = (1,2)

coord[1] = (1,5)

coord[2] = (4,2)

coord[3] = (4,5)

Then, p1 = (1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

p2 = (4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

res = |sqrt(9) * sqrt(9)| = 3 * 3 = 9, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

Sorting these points:

(-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)

coord[0] = (-1,-1)

coord[1] = (-1,1)

coord[2] = (1,-1)

coord[3] = (1,1)

p1 = (-1 - -1)^2 + (1 - -1)^2 = 0 + 4 = 4

p2 = (1 - 1)^2 + (1 - -1)^2 = 0 + 4 = 4

res = sqrt(4) * sqrt(4) = 2 * 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Sorting these points:

(17,11), (17,39), (45,11), (45,39)

coord[0] = (17,11)

coord[1] = (17,39)

coord[2] = (45,11)

coord[3] = (45,39)

p1 = (17-17)^2 + (39-11)^2 = 0 + 784 = 784

p2 = (45-45)^2 + (39-11)^2 = 0 + 784 = 784

res = sqrt(784) * sqrt(784) = 28 * 28 = 784, which matches the sample output.

So, in these cases, the code works correctly.

But let's consider if there are any edge cases where this approach might fail.

For example, if the square has side length 0, but the problem states that the area is strictly greater than 0, so we don't need to handle that case.

What if the points are not in the exact arrangement assumed? For example, what if after sorting, coord[1] and coord[0] don't have the same x-coordinate.

Wait, in the sorting method used, the points are sorted first by x, then by y.

So, points with the same x are grouped together, with lower y first.

Given that, in a square with sides parallel to the axes, the two points with the smallest x will have the same x, and their y-values will span the height of the square.

Similarly, the two points with the largest x will have the same x, and their y-values will span the height of the square.

Therefore, in this arrangement, p1 and p2 will both be equal to the square of the side length, and their square roots multiplied will give the area.

So, as long as the points form a square with sides parallel to the axes, this method should work.

But, to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any arrangement of points that would break this assumption.

Suppose the points are:

0 0

0 1

1 0

1 1

Sorting them:

(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

p1 = (0-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 0 + 1 = 1

p2 = (1-1)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 0 + 1 = 1

res = 1 * 1 = 1, which is correct.

Another example:

2 3

2 7

5 3

5 7

Sorting:

(2,3), (2,7), (5,3), (5,7)

p1 = (2-2)^2 + (7-3)^2 = 0 + 16 = 16

p2 = (5-5)^2 + (7-3)^2 = 0 + 16 = 16

res = 4 * 4 = 16, which is correct.

Seems consistent.

What if the square is rotated, not aligned with the axes? But the problem states that the square has sides parallel to the axes, so we don't need to handle rotated squares.

Also, the problem guarantees that the inputs form a valid square with positive area, so we don't need to handle degenerate cases.

Therefore, the provided code correctly calculates the area of the square in all intended cases.

Hence, the correctness is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{9} \]

\[ \boxed{4} \]

\[ \boxed{784} \]
