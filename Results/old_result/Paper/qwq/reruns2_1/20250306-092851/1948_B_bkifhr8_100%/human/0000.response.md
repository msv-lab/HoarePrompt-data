Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform this operation where I take any number that's at least 10, delete it, and insert its digits in the same position. I can do this any number of times, and I need to determine if I can make the array sorted in non-decreasing order after these operations.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have a number like 12 in the array, and I apply the operation, it gets replaced by 1 and 2. So, [12] becomes [1, 2]. If I have 45, it becomes [4, 5], and so on. The key here is that I can do this operation any number of times, but it's only for numbers that are at least 10.

Now, the problem is to check if, after applying these operations as needed, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order. That means, the final array should have elements where each element is less than or equal to the next one.

Let's look at the examples to get a better understanding.

First test case:

4

12 3 45 67

If I apply the operation to 12, it becomes [1,2], so the array would be [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

Second test case:

3

12 28 5

If I apply the operation to 12, it becomes [1,2,28,5]. That's not sorted.

If I apply the operation to 28, it becomes [12,2,8,5]. Still not sorted.

If I apply the operation to 12 and 28, I get [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted.

It seems like there's no way to make this sorted.

Third test case:

2

0 0

It's already sorted, so no need for any operations.

From these examples, it seems like the operation allows breaking down numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits, and then checking if the array can be sorted.

But wait, the operation is to delete the number and insert its digits in the same position. So, for example, if I have [12,3,45,67], and I apply the operation to 12, it becomes [1,2,3,45,67]. If I apply it to 45, it becomes [1,2,3,4,5,67]. And if I apply it to 67, it becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. So, in this case, it's already sorted.

In the second example, [12,28,5], if I apply the operation to 12 and 28, I get [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted.

Wait, but maybe there's a different sequence of operations that could make it sorted. Maybe I can apply the operation only to 28, getting [12,2,8,5]. This is [12,2,8,5], which is not sorted. Or apply the operation to 12 first, getting [1,2,28,5], which is [1,2,28,5], still not sorted. It seems like no matter what I do, I can't sort this array.

So, the task is to determine if such a sequence of operations exists that results in a sorted array.

Now, thinking about how to approach this programmatically.

One way is to consider that for each number in the array, if it's greater than or equal to 10, I have a choice: either leave it as is or break it down into its digits. So, for each such number, I can consider both options and see if any of them leads to a sorted array.

However, with n up to 50, and each element possibly being broken down into up to 2 digits, the number of possible configurations could be quite large. Specifically, for each element that is >=10, I have two choices: keep it as is or break it down. So, in the worst case, it's 2^n possibilities, which for n=50 would be too slow to compute.

Therefore, I need a more efficient approach.

Let me think about the properties of the sorted array. In a sorted array, each element is less than or equal to the next element.

Given that, I can iterate through the array and ensure that for each pair of consecutive elements, the first is less than or equal to the second.

Now, for each pair, I need to consider the possible transformations.

Wait, maybe I can iterate from left to right, and keep track of the maximum value so far, ensuring that each subsequent element (after possible breakdown) is greater than or equal to the maximum.

But I need to consider that breaking down a number into digits can affect the positions of subsequent elements.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fully expand all numbers that are >=10 into their digits. Then, I have a flattened array of single digits, and I can check if this array is sorted.

But, the problem is that I don't have to break down all numbers. I can choose to keep some numbers intact if they are >=10.

So, in the first example, [12,3,45,67], if I break down all numbers, I get [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], which is sorted.

But, I could also choose to keep some numbers intact. For example, if I keep 12 broken down as [1,2], and keep 45 as is, the array becomes [1,2,3,45,67], which is still sorted because 2 <= 3 <= 45 <= 67.

So, the choice is whether to break down a number or keep it intact, with the goal of having the entire array sorted.

Now, to make this efficient, maybe I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value so far. For each position, if I decide to break down the number, I need to ensure that all its digits are >= the maximum so far. If I decide to keep the number intact, I need to ensure that the number itself is >= the maximum so far.

Wait, but breaking down the number affects the positions of subsequent elements.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate from left to right, and for each position, I consider both options: breaking down the number into digits or keeping it intact. Then, I can check if the resulting array is sorted.

To optimize this, I can use dynamic programming, where I keep track of the maximum value up to the current position, and whether the array up to that position can be sorted given that maximum.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a function dp(i, max_so_far) that returns True if the subarray from position i to the end can be sorted with the maximum value up to position i-1 being 'max_so_far'.

Then, for each position i, if a[i] >= max_so_far, I can keep it as is, and recurse to dp(i+1, max(a[i], max_so_far)).

Alternatively, if a[i] >= 10, I can choose to break it down into its digits, and for each digit, ensure that digit >= max_so_far, and then update max_so_far accordingly.

Wait, but digits are always <=9, so if a[i] is >=10 and I choose to break it down, I need to ensure that all its digits are >= max_so_far.

But max_so_far could be less than 10, so this might not always hold.

This seems too involved, and I'm not sure if it's the best approach.

Let me consider the greedy approach.

Start from the left, and for each element, if it's >=10, decide whether to break it down or keep it intact based on whether it helps in making the array sorted.

But how do I decide the best choice at each step?

Maybe I can iterate through the array, and for each element, consider both options: breaking it down or keeping it, and choose the one that allows the array to remain sorted.

But this still seems too vague.

Let me look back at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program is:

def func():

n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):

m = int(input())

arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

ans = True

for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):

if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:

nums = [int(j) for j in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]

if nums != sorted(nums):

ans = False

break

arr[i - 1] = nums[0]

print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the array.

Then, it iterates from the end to the beginning, and for each position i, if arr[i] < arr[i-1], it breaks down arr[i-1] into its digits and checks if the resulting list of digits plus arr[i] is sorted.

If it's not sorted, it sets ans to False and breaks.

Otherwise, it sets arr[i-1] to the first digit of the broken-down arr[i-1].

Finally, it prints 'YES' if ans is True, else 'NO'.

Let's see how this works with the first example.

First test case:

4

12 3 45 67

Iterate from i=3 to i=1.

At i=3, check if 67 < 45? No.

At i=2, check if 45 < 3? No.

At i=1, check if 3 < 12? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=12 into [1,2], and check if [1,2,3] is sorted. It is.

Then, set arr[0]=1.

So, the modified array would be [1,3,45,67], which is sorted.

Hence, ans remains True.

Second test case:

3

12 28 5

Iterate from i=2 to i=1.

At i=2, check if 5 < 28? No.

At i=1, check if 28 < 12? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=12 into [1,2], and check if [1,2,28,5] is sorted.

Is [1,2,28,5] sorted? No, because 28 > 5.

So, set ans=False and break.

Hence, print 'NO'.

Third test case:

2

0 0

Iterate from i=1 to i=1.

At i=1, check if 0 < 0? No.

So, ans remains True.

Hence, print 'YES'.

This seems to work for the given examples.

But is this approach correct in general?

Let's think about potential issues.

One potential issue is that by breaking down only the preceding number when a[i] < a[i-1], we might not consider all possible breakdowns that could lead to a sorted array.

For example, consider the array [23, 1, 34].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 34 < 1? No.

At i=1, check if 1 < 23? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=23 into [2,3], and check if [2,3,1,34] is sorted.

Is [2,3,1,34] sorted? No, because 3 > 1.

Hence, set ans=False.

But is there another way to break down the numbers to make it sorted?

What if we break down 34 into [3,4], making the array [23,1,3,4].

Then, break down 23 into [2,3], resulting in [2,3,1,3,4], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, if we break down 23 into [2,3], and then break down 34 into [3,4], we get [2,3,1,3,4], which is still not sorted.

So, in this case, it's correctly identifying that it's not possible to sort the array.

Another example: [19, 2, 20].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 20 < 2? No.

At i=1, check if 2 < 19? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=19 into [1,9], and check if [1,9,2,20] is sorted.

Is [1,9,2,20] sorted? No, because 9 > 2.

Hence, set ans=False.

Again, is there another way to break down the numbers to make it sorted?

If we break down 20 into [2,0], making the array [19,2,2,0], which is not sorted.

Or break down both 19 and 20: [1,9,2,2,0], which is not sorted.

So, again, correctly identifying that it's not possible.

Another example: [10, 11, 12].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 12 < 11? No.

At i=1, check if 11 < 10? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=10 into [1,0], and check if [1,0,11,12] is sorted.

Is [1,0,11,12] sorted? No, because 0 < 1.

Hence, set ans=False.

But wait, is there a way to make it sorted?

If we break down 10 and 11: [1,0,1,1,12], which is not sorted because 0 < 1.

Alternatively, break down only 11: [10,1,1,12], but 10 > 1, so not sorted.

So, correctly identifying that it's not possible.

Wait, but [1,0,11,12], is that sorted? 1 <= 0 is False, so no.

Another example where it might fail: [15, 2, 22].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 22 < 2? No.

At i=1, check if 2 < 15? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=15 into [1,5], and check if [1,5,2,22] is sorted.

Is [1,5,2,22] sorted? No, because 5 > 2.

Hence, set ans=False.

Is there another way? Break down 22 into [2,2], making it [15,2,2,2].

Is [15,2,2,2] sorted? No, because 15 > 2.

Break down both 15 and 22: [1,5,2,2,2], which is not sorted because 5 > 2.

So, again, correctly identifying that it's not possible.

Wait, but what if the breakdown leads to multiple digits, and those digits are placed in such a way that the array becomes sorted.

But in the above cases, it seems the program correctly identifies that it's not possible.

Let me think of a case where the program might fail.

Consider [11, 11, 11].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 11 < 11? No.

At i=1, check if 11 < 11? No.

So, ans remains True.

Indeed, breaking down any 11 into [1,1] would still result in a sorted array, since [1,1,1,1,1] is sorted.

So, correctly identifying that it's possible.

Another case: [13, 12, 14].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 14 < 12? No.

At i=1, check if 12 < 13? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=13 into [1,3], and check if [1,3,12,14] is sorted.

Is [1,3,12,14] sorted? Yes, 1 <= 3 <= 12 <= 14.

Hence, ans remains True.

So, it correctly identifies that it's possible.

Wait, but in this case, breaking down 13 leads to a sorted array.

But what if we have [13, 3, 14].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 14 < 3? No.

At i=1, check if 3 < 13? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=13 into [1,3], and check if [1,3,3,14] is sorted.

Is [1,3,3,14] sorted? Yes.

Hence, ans remains True.

So, it correctly identifies that it's possible.

But in this case, breaking down 13 helps in making the array sorted.

Another case: [21, 1, 22].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 22 < 1? No.

At i=1, check if 1 < 21? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=21 into [2,1], and check if [2,1,1,22] is sorted.

Is [2,1,1,22] sorted? No, because 2 > 1.

Hence, set ans=False.

But is there another way? Break down 22 into [2,2], making it [21,1,2,2].

Is [21,1,2,2] sorted? No, because 1 < 21.

Break down both 21 and 22: [2,1,1,2,2], which is not sorted because 1 < 21.

Wait, no, [2,1,1,2,2], but 1 < 2, which is fine, but earlier 2 > 1 is not a problem.

Wait, [2,1,1,2,2], is this sorted? 1 <= 1 <= 2 <= 2, but 2 >=1, which is fine.

Wait, but 2 >=1 is fine, as it's non-decreasing.

Wait, no, 2 >=1 is fine, but the sequence is [2,1,1,2,2].

Is this sorted in non-decreasing order? No, because 2 >1.

Wait, non-decreasing means each element is <= the next one.

So, 2 >1 violates that.

Hence, it's not sorted.

So, in this case, the program correctly identifies that it's not possible.

Another case: [10, 1, 10].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 10 < 1? No.

At i=1, check if 1 < 10? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=10 into [1,0], and check if [1,0,1,10] is sorted.

Is [1,0,1,10] sorted? No, because 0 <1.

Hence, set ans=False.

Is there another way? Break down both 10s: [1,0,1,0,10], which is not sorted.

So, correctly identifying that it's not possible.

Wait, but [1,0,1,10], is 1 >=0, 0 <=1, 1 <=10, which seems fine.

Wait, 1 >=0 is fine, 0 <=1 is fine, 1 <=10 is fine.

But [1,0,1,10], is this sorted in non-decreasing order? No, because 1 >0, which violates the non-decreasing order.

Hence, it's correctly identifying that it's not possible.

So, it seems like the program is working correctly for these cases.

But let's think about a case where breaking down a number helps in making the array sorted.

Consider [14, 15, 16].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 16 <15? No.

At i=1, check if 15 <14? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=14 into [1,4], and check if [1,4,15,16] is sorted.

Is [1,4,15,16] sorted? Yes.

Hence, ans remains True.

So, it correctly identifies that it's possible.

Another case: [20, 19, 21].

Following the program's logic:

At i=2, check if 21 <19? No.

At i=1, check if 19 <20? Yes.

So, break down arr[0]=20 into [2,0], and check if [2,0,19,21] is sorted.

Is [2,0,19,21] sorted? No, because 0 <2.

Hence, set ans=False.

But is there another way? Break down 21 into [2,1], making it [20,19,2,1], which is not sorted.

Break down both 20 and 21: [2,0,19,2,1], which is not sorted.

So, correctly identifying that it's not possible.

Wait, but [2,0,19,21], 2 >=0, 0 <=19, 19 <=21, seems fine.

But in non-decreasing order, 0 should not be after 2.

Wait, non-decreasing order means each element is <= the next one.

So, 2 >=0 is fine, 0 <=19 is fine, 19 <=21 is fine.

Hence, it should be considered sorted.

But according to the program, it checks if nums != sorted(nums), where nums is [2,0,19,21].

So, sorted([2,0,19,21]) is [0,2,19,21], which is different from [2,0,19,21].

Hence, it sets ans=False, which is incorrect because [2,0,19,21] is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Wait, no, [2,0,19,21] is not sorted in non-decreasing order because 2 >0.

Wait, non-decreasing order means each element is <= the next one.

So, 2 >0 violates that.

Hence, it's correctly identifying that it's not sorted.

Wait, but in the earlier step, when arr[i] < arr[i-1], it breaks down arr[i-1] and checks if the new list is sorted.

In this case, breaking down arr[0]=20 into [2,0], and checking if [2,0,19,21] is sorted.

But [2,0,19,21] is not sorted because 2 >0.

Hence, it's correctly setting ans=False.

So, it seems like the program is working correctly.

Another potential issue is when breaking down a number affects subsequent elements.

But in the program, after breaking down arr[i-1], it only considers the first digit of the breakdown to replace arr[i-1], and the rest are inserted before arr[i].

Wait, in the code, it sets arr[i-1] = nums[0], where nums is the digits of arr[i-1] plus arr[i].

Wait, let's look back at the code:

nums = [int(j) for j in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]

if nums != sorted(nums):

ans = False

break

arr[i - 1] = nums[0]

So, it's checking if the list of digits of arr[i-1] plus arr[i] is sorted.

If it's not sorted, set ans=False.

Otherwise, set arr[i-1] to the first digit of arr[i-1].

Wait, in the earlier example, [20,19,21], breaking down 20 into [2,0], and checking [2,0,19,21].

Is [2,0,19,21] sorted? No, because 2 >0.

Hence, set ans=False, which is correct.

Another example: [12,3,45,67], breaking down 12 into [1,2], and checking [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

Hence, ans remains True.

So, it seems like the program is correctly identifying whether it's possible to make the array sorted.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correct}}\]
