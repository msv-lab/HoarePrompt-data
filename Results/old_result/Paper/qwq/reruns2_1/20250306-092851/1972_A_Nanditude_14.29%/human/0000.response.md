Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n problems in a contest, each with a difficulty a_i, and each expected difficulty is at most b_i. Both arrays a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order. The task is to make sure that for every problem, its actual difficulty a_i is less than or equal to its expected difficulty b_i, i.e., a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

If some a_i are greater than b_i, I need to propose new problems with certain difficulties w, insert them into a, sort a again in non-decreasing order, and then remove the most difficult problem (the last one after sorting). I need to find the minimum number of such operations (proposing new problems) to achieve a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

First, I need to understand the process clearly. Each time I propose a new problem with difficulty w, I insert w into a, sort a, and then remove the largest difficulty. So effectively, I'm replacing the hardest problem in a with w, but in a sorted manner.

Looking at the example provided:

Test case 1:

n = 6

a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]

b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]

Output: 2

Explanation:

1. Propose w=800

   - a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] after insertion and sorting, then remove the last element 2200.

2. Propose w=1800

   - a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] after insertion and sorting, then remove the last element 2000.

After these operations, a = [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] and b = [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000], so a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

Another test case:

n = 6

a = [4,5,6,7,8,9]

b = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: 3

Explanation:

1. Propose w=1

   - a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8], remove 8

2. Propose w=2

   - a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7], remove 7

3. Propose w=3

   - a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6], remove 6

Now a = [1,2,3,4,5,6] and b = [1,2,3,4,5,6], so a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

From these examples, it seems like the strategy is to iterate through the arrays and whenever a[i] > b[j], propose a new problem with difficulty b[j], insert it into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

But I need to think about whether this is the most efficient way and if there's a better approach.

Let me think about the problem more carefully.

Given that both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order, I can use two pointers, one for a and one for b, to compare elements.

I need to ensure that for each position i, a[i] ≤ b[i].

If a[i] > b[i], I need to reduce a[i] to be ≤ b[i]. To do this, I can propose a new problem with difficulty w ≤ b[i], insert it into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

Each operation allows me to insert w and remove the largest element in a, effectively replacing the largest element in a with w, but in a sorted manner.

I need to minimize the number of such operations.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Initialize two pointers, i and j, starting from the beginning of a and b.

- While both pointers are within their respective arrays:

- If a[i] > b[j], it means I need to make a[i] ≤ b[j]. To do this, I can propose a new problem with difficulty w ≤ b[j]. After inserting w into a and sorting, the largest element in a will be removed.

- So, I can choose w = b[j], insert it into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

- After this operation, the new a will have one less element than before, and the remaining elements are sorted.

- I need to keep track of how many operations I perform.

Wait, but in the first test case, they performed 2 operations, and in the second, 3 operations.

Let me think differently.

Another way to look at it is to find how many a[i] are greater than b[i], and for each such a[i], I need at least one operation to replace it with a smaller value.

But it's not that simple because when I insert a new problem with difficulty w, it affects the entire array a after sorting and removing the largest element.

I need a more systematic way to count the minimum number of operations.

Let me consider the following idea:

- Since both a and b are sorted, I can use two pointers to iterate through them.

- I'll have a pointer i for a and a pointer j for b.

- I'll start from the smallest elements.

- If a[i] ≤ b[j], that's fine, I can move both pointers forward.

- If a[i] > b[j], I need to propose a new problem with difficulty w ≤ b[j], insert it into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

- This operation effectively replaces the largest element in a with w, but since w is less than or equal to b[j], it should help in making sure that the new a[i] is ≤ b[j].

- However, I need to think about which element in a is being replaced.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the largest elements.

Let me consider that the operations allow me to replace the largest element in a with a new proposed problem of any difficulty w.

So, perhaps I should look at the largest elements in a and see if they are greater than the corresponding b[i].

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that b is sorted in a particular way, but according to the problem statement, b is also sorted in non-decreasing order.

Wait, the problem says: "Both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order."

So, both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given that, I can iterate through the arrays simultaneously using two pointers.

Let me consider the following algorithm:

- Initialize two pointers, i and j, both starting at 0.

- Initialize a counter for the number of operations.

- While i < n and j < n:

- If a[i] > b[j], it means that a[i] needs to be reduced to be ≤ b[j].

- To do this, I can propose a new problem with difficulty w ≤ b[j], insert it into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

- This operation effectively replaces the largest element in a with w.

- So, by choosing w = b[j], I'm ensuring that the largest element in a is set to b[j], and since b is sorted, b[j] is the smallest possible expected difficulty at position j.

- After this operation, the new a will have its largest element set to b[j], and I can consider that a[i] is now ≤ b[j].

- However, I need to think about how this affects the rest of the array.

- Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the current largest elements.

- Maybe I should iterate from the end of the arrays, since the operations affect the largest elements.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I look at the largest element in a, which is a[n-1], and compare it to b[n-1].

- If a[n-1] > b[n-1], I need to perform an operation to reduce a[n-1] to be ≤ b[n-1].

- To do this, I can propose a new problem with w ≤ b[n-1], insert it into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

- This will replace the current largest element in a with w.

- So, if I choose w = b[n-1], the new a will have its largest element set to b[n-1].

- Then, I can consider the new a and compare a[n-1] with b[n-1] again.

- But since a is sorted, and I'm replacing the largest element, the rest of the array remains sorted.

- I need to continue this process until a[i] ≤ b[i] for all i.

But this seems inefficient, especially for large n.

I need a more efficient way to count the minimum number of operations.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Use two pointers, i and j, starting from the beginning.

- Initialize a counter for operations.

- While i < n and j < n:

- If a[i] > b[j], it means I need to perform an operation to make a[i] ≤ b[j].

- So, I increment the operation counter.

- Then, I need to simulate the operation: insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

- But since a is sorted, inserting w and sorting can be simulated by inserting w in the correct position and then removing the largest element.

- However, this would be time-consuming if done naively.

- Instead, perhaps I can keep track of the elements in a that are greater than b[j], and for each such element, perform an operation to replace it.

- But I need to minimize the number of operations, so I need to be strategic about when to perform operations.

Wait, maybe I can use a greedy approach.

Greedy Approach:

- Initialize two pointers, i and j, starting at 0.

- Initialize a counter for operations.

- While i < n and j < n:

- If a[i] > b[j], perform an operation:

- Propose a new problem with w = b[j].

- Insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

- Since a is sorted, inserting w and sorting can be simulated by inserting w in the correct position and removing the last element.

- Increment the operation counter.

- Else:

- Move both pointers forward (i +=1, j +=1)

- Continue until all elements are processed.

This seems similar to the code provided.

Looking at the provided code:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

cnt = 0

i = 0

j = 0

while i < n and j < n:

if b[j] < a[i]:

a.pop(-1)

a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]

cnt += 1

j += 1

else:

i += 1

j += 1

print(cnt)

Wait, there's a mistake here.

In the code, when b[j] < a[i], it performs the operation: pops the last element from a, inserts b[j] at position i, and sorts a.

But according to the problem, inserting w into a, sorting a, and removing the last element should effectively replace the largest element in a with w.

But in the code, it's inserting b[j] at position i and sorting a.

This might not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem.

Let me think about how to correctly simulate the operation.

When I propose a new problem with difficulty w:

1. Insert w into a.

2. Sort a in non-decreasing order.

3. Remove the last element (the largest element).

So, in effect, the largest element in a is replaced with w, but in a sorted manner.

To simulate this efficiently without sorting the entire array each time, I can keep track of the elements in a priority queue or maintain a sorted list.

But since a is initially sorted, and we need to insert w and remove the largest element, I can do the following:

- Insert w into a in the correct position.

- Remove the last element.

But in the code provided, it's inserting b[j] at position i, which might not be correct.

In the first test case:

n=6

a=[1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b=[800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

First iteration:

i=0, j=0

a[0]=1000 > b[0]=800 → perform operation

Propose w=800

Insert 800 into a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700,800]

Sort a: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

Remove the last element: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

Now a=[800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

Second iteration:

i=0, j=1

a[0]=800 <= b[1]=1200 → move both pointers

Third iteration:

i=1, j=2

a[1]=1000 <= b[2]=1500 → move both pointers

Fourth iteration:

i=2, j=3

a[2]=1400 <= b[3]=1800 → move both pointers

Fifth iteration:

i=3, j=4

a[3]=2000 > b[4]=2200 → perform operation

Propose w=2200

Insert 2200 into a: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2200]

Sort a: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2200]

Remove the last element: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

Now a=[800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

Sixth iteration:

i=3, j=4

Now a[3]=2000 <= b[4]=2200 → move both pointers

Seventh iteration:

i=4, j=5

a[4]=2000 <= b[5]=3000 → move both pointers

So, only 1 operation was performed, but according to the example, it should be 2 operations.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, in the first operation, after inserting 800 and removing 2700, a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

Then, in the second operation, propose w=1800

Insert 1800 into a: [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000,2200]

Sort a: [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000,2200]

Remove the last element: [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]

So, after 2 operations, a=[800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]

Now, a[3]=1800 <= b[3]=1800, a[4]=2000 <= b[4]=2200, a[5]=2000 <= b[5]=3000

So, it works with 2 operations.

But in my earlier simulation, I thought only 1 operation was needed, but that was incorrect.

So, the provided code seems to perform operations when b[j] < a[i], which seems counterintuitive because b is expected to be greater than or equal to a.

Wait, in the problem, b is the expected maximum difficulty, so a should be less than or equal to b.

In the condition b[j] < a[i], it means that the expected difficulty b[j] is less than the actual difficulty a[i], so we need to perform an operation to reduce a[i].

Hence, proposing a new problem with difficulty w <= b[j], inserting it into a, sorting a, and removing the largest element.

So, the condition b[j] < a[i] makes sense for triggering an operation.

But in my earlier simulation, I had a mistake in counting the operations.

Let me think about how to implement this correctly.

I need to iterate through a and b with two pointers.

Whenever a[i] > b[j], perform an operation: propose w = b[j], insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

Then, continue comparing.

But simulating this insertion and sorting in code is inefficient for large n, as it would be O(t * n^2).

Given that n can be up to 100 and t up to 100, it's manageable, but I need a better way.

An optimization is to realize that each operation reduces the largest element in a to w, which is <= b[j].

So, instead of simulating the insertion and removal, I can keep track of how many operations are needed by counting how many a[i] > b[j] for corresponding i and j.

But it's not straightforward.

An alternative approach is to use a sliding window or two-pointer technique to count the number of a[i] that are greater than b[j], and perform operations accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can use the difference in positions where a[i] > b[j].

Let me consider that in the sorted arrays, I can find the number of a[i] that are greater than b[j] for each j.

But it's getting complicated.

Looking back at the provided code:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

cnt = 0

i = 0

j = 0

while i < n and j < n:

if b[j] < a[i]:

a.pop(-1)

a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]

cnt += 1

j += 1

else:

i += 1

j += 1

print(cnt)

This code performs operations when b[j] < a[i], which makes sense as explained earlier.

But in the first operation, it pops the last element from a, inserts b[j] at position i, and sorts a.

Wait, but in the problem, after inserting w into a, sorting a, and removing the largest element, it's equivalent to setting the largest element to w.

But in the code, it's inserting b[j] at position i and then sorting a, which might not be correct.

In the first operation, when b[j] < a[i], I should insert w = b[j] into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

But in the code, it's inserting b[j] at position i and then sorting a, which is not the same as inserting w and sorting a to get a sorted array and then removing the last element.

Let me see with the first test case.

Initial a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b: [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

First iteration:

i=0, j=0

a[i]=1000 > b[j]=800 → perform operation

Pop last element from a: a becomes [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

Insert b[j]=800 at position i=0: a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

Sort a: already sorted.

So, a is [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

cnt=1

Second iteration:

i=0, j=1

a[i]=800 <= b[j]=1200 → move both pointers

Third iteration:

i=1, j=2

a[i]=1000 <= b[j]=1500 → move both pointers

Fourth iteration:

i=2, j=3

a[i]=1400 <= b[j]=1800 → move both pointers

Fifth iteration:

i=3, j=4

a[i]=2000 > b[j]=2200 → perform operation

Pop last element from a: a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000]

Insert b[j]=2200 at position i=3: a becomes [800,1000,1400,2200,2000,2000]

Wait, but the code is a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i+1:]

So, a = [800,1000,1400,2200,2000,2000]

Then sort a: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

But in the code, it's sorting a after insertion.

So, a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

cnt=2

Sixth iteration:

i=3, j=4

a[i]=2000 <= b[j]=2200 → move both pointers

Seventh iteration:

i=4, j=5

a[i]=2000 <= b[j]=3000 → move both pointers

End of loop.

So, cnt=2, which matches the first test case.

In the second test case:

n=6

a=[4,5,6,7,8,9]

b=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

First iteration:

i=0, j=0

a[i]=4 > b[j]=1 → perform operation

Pop last element from a: a=[4,5,6,7,8]

Insert b[j]=1 at position i=0: a=[1,4,5,6,7,8]

Sort a: [1,4,5,6,7,8]

cnt=1

Second iteration:

i=0, j=1

a[i]=1 <= b[j]=2 → move both pointers

Third iteration:

i=1, j=2

a[i]=4 > b[j]=3 → perform operation

Pop last element from a: a=[1,4,5,6,7]

Insert b[j]=3 at position i=1: a=[1,3,4,5,6,7]

Sort a: [1,3,4,5,6,7]

cnt=2

Fourth iteration:

i=1, j=3

a[i]=3 <= b[j]=4 → move both pointers

Fifth iteration:

i=2, j=4

a[i]=4 > b[j]=5 → perform operation

Pop last element from a: a=[1,3,4,5,6]

Insert b[j]=5 at position i=2: a=[1,3,5,4,5,6]

Sort a: [1,3,4,5,5,6]

cnt=3

Sixth iteration:

i=2, j=5

a[i]=4 <= b[j]=6 → move both pointers

Seventh iteration:

i=3, j=5

a[i]=5 <= b[j]=6 → move both pointers

Eighth iteration:

i=4, j=5

a[i]=5 <= b[j]=6 → move both pointers

Ninth iteration:

i=5, j=5

a[i]=6 <= b[j]=6 → move both pointers

End of loop.

So, cnt=3, which matches the second test case.

Therefore, the provided code seems to be correct.

But I need to verify if this approach always works.

Let me think about another test case.

Test case:

n=3

a=[1,2,3]

b=[1,2,3]

Expected output: 0

No operations needed since a_i <= b_i for all i.

Another test case:

n=3

a=[2,3,4]

b=[1,2,3]

Here, a[0]=2 > b[0]=1 → perform operation with w=1

a becomes [1,2,3,4], sort and remove the largest: [1,2,3]

Now a=[1,2,3]

Compare with b=[1,2,3]

No more operations needed.

Total operations: 1

According to the code:

i=0, j=0

a[i]=2 > b[j]=1 → perform operation

Pop last element: a=[2,3,4]

Insert b[j]=1 at position i=0: a=[1,2,3,4]

Sort a: [1,2,3,4]

Remove the largest: a=[1,2,3]

cnt=1

Then, i=0, j=1

a[i]=1 <= b[j]=2 → move both pointers

i=1, j=2

a[i]=2 <= b[j]=3 → move both pointers

i=2, j=3

End of loop.

So, cnt=1, which is correct.

Another test case:

n=1

a=[1000]

b=[2000]

Since 1000 <= 2000, no operation needed.

Output: 0

Another test case:

n=1

a=[2000]

b=[1000]

Since 2000 > 1000, perform operation with w=1000

a becomes [1000], sort and remove the largest: a=[1000]

But a=[1000] and b=[1000], so a_i <= b_i.

Output: 1

According to the code:

i=0, j=0

a[i]=2000 > b[j]=1000 → perform operation

Pop last element: a=[]

Insert b[j]=1000 at position i=0: a=[1000]

Sort a: [1000]

Remove the largest: a=[]

But a is now empty, and n=1, which is incorrect.

Wait, the code would have issues when a becomes empty before processing all elements.

Wait, in the code, after popping the last element and inserting b[j] at position i, if i is 0, a becomes [b[j]], sort it, and remove the last element, which would make a empty.

But n is 1, so it's invalid.

Wait, perhaps the code needs to ensure that a always has n elements.

In the provided code, after inserting b[j] at position i and sorting a, it removes the last element.

But in this case, a becomes empty, which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is flawed.

In the problem statement, it says "insert it into a, sort a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last element."

So, in the case when n=1, and a=[2000], b=[1000]:

- Propose w=1000

- Insert w into a: a=[2000,1000]

- Sort a: [1000,2000]

- Remove the last element: a=[1000]

So, a becomes [1000], which is correct.

In the code, after inserting b[j]=1000 at position i=0, a becomes [1000,2000]

Sort a: [1000,2000]

Remove the last element: a=[1000]

So, it works.

Wait, in my earlier thought, I thought a becomes empty, but that's incorrect.

So, in this case, a becomes [1000], which is correct.

Another test case:

n=2

a=[1,3]

b=[2,4]

First iteration:

i=0, j=0

a[i]=1 <= b[j]=2 → move both pointers

Second iteration:

i=1, j=1

a[i]=3 <= b[j]=4 → move both pointers

End of loop.

cnt=0, which is correct.

Another test case:

n=2

a=[2,3]

b=[1,4]

First iteration:

i=0, j=0

a[i]=2 > b[j]=1 → perform operation

Pop last element: a=[2]

Insert b[j]=1 at position i=0: a=[1,2]

Sort a: [1,2]

Remove the largest: a=[1]

But n=2, so a should have 2 elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that a always has n elements.

Wait, in the problem, it says "insert it into a, sort a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last element."

So, after each operation, a should have n elements.

But in this case, after the operation, a becomes [1], which has only 1 element.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the operation.

Wait, in the problem, it says "insert it into a, sort a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last element."

But it should keep a having n elements.

Wait, in the first test case, a had 6 elements, and after inserting and removing one, it still has 6 elements.

Wait, no, in the first operation, a had 6 elements, inserted w, sorted, and removed the last element, so it should still have 6 elements.

Wait, in the code, a.pop(-1) removes one element, but after inserting one, it should still have n elements.

Wait, in the code, it pops one element after inserting one, so a should still have n elements.

Wait, in the first test case, a had 6 elements, inserted w, sorted, and removed the last element, so it should still have 6 elements.

In my earlier mistake, when n=1, a=[1000], inserted w=1000, sorted, and removed the last element, a becomes [1000], which is still has 1 element.

So, a always has n elements after each operation.

In the code, after inserting b[j] at position i and sorting a, it removes the last element, so a always has n elements.

Wait, in the code, a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i+1:]

This inserts b[j] at position i and removes the element at position i.

Then, it sorts a.

Wait, this is not correctly simulating the operation described in the problem.

The problem says to insert w into a, sort a, and remove the last element.

But in the code, it's inserting b[j] at position i and then sorting a.

This is different from inserting w, sorting a, and then removing the last element.

In the correct operation, inserting w into a increases the length of a by 1, then sorting a and removing the last element brings the length back to n.

But in the code, it's inserting b[j] at position i and sorting a, which doesn't correctly simulate the operation.

In the first test case, when a=[1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700], b=[800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

First operation:

- Propose w=800

- Insert w into a: [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700,800]

- Sort a: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

- Remove the last element: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

So, a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]

In the code, it pops the last element first, then inserts b[j] at position i.

Which is not the same as inserting w, sorting, and then removing the last element.

So, the code is incorrect in simulating the operation.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

But according to the initial test cases, it seems to produce the correct output, but due to a flaw in the simulation, it might not work for all cases.

Wait, perhaps it's correct, but my analysis is flawed.

Let me think differently.

An alternative approach is to realize that each operation allows me to reduce the largest element in a to any value <= b[j].

So, I can prioritize reducing the largest elements in a that are greater than b[j].

This seems like a greedy approach where I focus on the largest a[i] that need to be reduced.

But I need to ensure that for each a[i], it's <= b[j], and since both arrays are sorted, I can use two pointers to track which elements need to be reduced.

Given that, perhaps the provided code is a correct implementation of this approach, even if it's not intuitively clear.

But considering the mistake I found in the n=1 test case, I think the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the difficulty of each problem in the contest does not exceed its expected difficulty. We can achieve this by proposing new problems and adjusting the existing ones accordingly.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of problems, the array of current problem difficulties (`a`), and the array of expected maximum difficulties (`b`).

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - If the current problem difficulty `a[i]` is greater than the expected difficulty `b[j]`, perform an operation to reduce `a[i]`:
     - Propose a new problem with difficulty `w = b[j]`.
     - Insert `w` into `a`, sort `a`, and remove the largest element.
     - Increment the operation counter.
   - If `a[i]` is less than or equal to `b[j]`, move both pointers forward.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - For each test case, output the number of operations performed.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if a[i] > b[j]:
            # Perform the operation
            a.pop(-1)  # Remove the largest element
            # Insert b[j] at position i
            a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i:]
            a.sort()  # Sort the array
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: Read input values and initialize variables.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**:
  - Compare elements of `a` and `b` using pointers `i` and `j`.
  - If `a[i] > b[j]`, perform an operation to adjust `a[i]`:
    - Remove the largest element in `a`.
    - Insert `b[j]` into `a` at position `i`.
    - Sort `a` to maintain non-decreasing order.
    - Increment the operation counter.
  - If `a[i] <= b[j]`, move both pointers forward.
- **Output**: Print the count of operations for each test case.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is performed to meet the condition `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.
