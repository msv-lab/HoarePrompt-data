Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. There are 2n cards in total, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. The cards are divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, starting with me, and we do this n times each, for a total of 2n turns.

On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, they place their selected card on the table. Importantly, all cards on the table are visible to both players at all times.

Nene is really smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options for that, she chooses the one that minimizes my score. My goal is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

Okay, so I need to model this game and find a strategy that maximizes my score against Nene's optimal play.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics better. Each number appears twice, so for each number, there are two cards with that number, and they're distributed between me and Nene in some way.

For example, if n=3, there are cards labeled 1,1,2,2,3,3. Suppose I have 1,2,3 and Nene has 1,2,3. The game would proceed with me and Nene taking turns to play one card at a time, for a total of 6 turns.

The key is that points are awarded if a card played matches a number already on the table.

I need to think about how to model the interaction between my moves and Nene's moves, considering that Nene is playing optimally against me.

This seems like a game theory problem, specifically a zero-sum game where Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a minimax problem, where I try to maximize my score, and Nene tries to minimize it.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) or O(n log n), but certainly not higher.

Let me think about the structure of the game.

Each number appears exactly twice, so for each number, there are two cards: one with me and one with Nene, or both with me, or both with Nene.

Wait, no, since the total is 2n cards, and each player gets n cards, and each number appears exactly twice, it's possible for me to have both cards of a certain number, or one, or none.

Wait, no, the problem says: "the cards in your hand have a1, a2, ..., an written on them", and "each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most 2 times". So, I can have zero, one, or two cards of each number.

Similarly, Nene will have the remaining cards, so for each number, if I have zero cards, Nene has two; if I have one, Nene has one; if I have two, Nene has zero.

So, for each number, we can categorize:

- If I have two cards, Nene has none.

- If I have one card, Nene has one card.

- If I have zero cards, Nene has two cards.

Given that, I can count, for each number, how many cards I have and how many Nene has.

Now, the game proceeds with me and Nene alternately playing cards, each playing n times, for a total of 2n turns.

On each turn, the player selects a card from their hand, and if that number is already on the table, they get a point. Then, they place the card on the table.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and among optimal moves, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to find the maximum score I can achieve against Nene's optimal play.

This seems complex. Let's try to simplify it.

First, let's consider that the game is fully deterministic, as all future moves are determined by the current state and the players' strategies.

I need to model the state of the game, which includes:

- The set of cards I have in my hand.

- The set of cards Nene has in her hand.

- The cards that are already on the table.

But with n up to 2*10^5, maintaining such a state is impossible due to time and space constraints.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the properties of the game.

Each number can contribute at most one point to either me or Nene, because the second card played for a number will be the one that gets the point.

Wait, no. Actually, the point is awarded only when the second card is played.

Wait, more precisely:

- When a card is played, if the number is already on the table, the player gets a point.

- Then, the played card is placed on the table.

So, for a number to give a point, both cards must be played, and the second one to be played will get the point.

Wait, actually, the first one played doesn't get a point, but the second one does, if the first one is already on the table.

Wait, let's clarify:

- Suppose a number x has not been played yet.

- If I play x, and it's not on the table, I don't get a point, and x is placed on the table.

- Then, when Nene plays the second x, it's already on the table, so she gets a point.

- Alternatively, if I play the second x, I get the point.

So, for each number, the player who plays the second card gets a point.

But, some numbers may have both cards with me, or both with Nene, or one with each.

Let's consider these cases:

1. I have both cards of a number.

- In this case, I can choose to play both cards, and I will get the point for that number, because I play the second card.

- Nene cannot play any card of this number, since both are with me.

2. Nene has both cards of a number.

- Similarly, Nene will play both cards and get the point for that number.

- I cannot play any card of this number.

3. I have one card, and Nene has one card.

- In this case, one of us will play the first card, and the other will play the second and get the point.

So, for numbers where I have both cards, I can guarantee myself a point.

For numbers where Nene has both cards, she will get the point.

For numbers where we each have one card, the point will go to whoever plays the second card.

Now, since I go first, and we take turns, I need to think about the sequence in which cards are played.

Wait, more precisely, we take n turns each, alternately, starting with me.

So, I play turn 1, Nene plays turn 2, I play turn 3, Nene turn 4, and so on, up to 2n turns.

I need to decide, in each of my turns, which card to play.

Nene will decide optimally for herself, to maximize her total points, and among those, minimize my points.

I need to choose my moves to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal response.

This seems like a zero-sum game, and it might be modeled using game theory, potentially with dynamic programming.

Let me try to model it.

First, let's categorize the numbers based on who has the cards:

- Let S be the set of all numbers from 1 to n.

- Let M be the set of numbers where I have both cards.

- Let N be the set of numbers where Nene has both cards.

- Let B be the set of numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

So, S = M U N U B, and M, N, B are pairwise disjoint.

For numbers in M, I will get the point.

For numbers in N, Nene will get the point.

For numbers in B, it depends on who plays the second card.

So, my total points will be |M| plus the points I get from numbers in B.

Similarly, Nene's total points will be |N| plus the points she gets from numbers in B.

Our focus is to maximize my points, which is |M| plus the points I can get from B.

Since |M| is fixed, I need to maximize the points from B.

Now, I need to model the interaction in B.

Let’s think about the numbers in B.

For each number in B, there are two cards: one with me and one with Nene.

So, for each number in B, the player who plays the second card gets the point.

Given that, I need to strategize to maximize the number of times I play the second card for numbers in B.

But, since Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, she will try to play the second card for as many numbers in B as possible.

Given that, I need to find a way to maximize my points from B, knowing that Nene is trying to minimize that.

This seems like a combinatorial game theory problem.

Let’s think about the game in terms of selecting which cards to play when.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient algorithm.

Perhaps I can find a way to calculate the number of points I can get from B.

Let’s consider the following:

- Let’s say |B| = k.

- For each number in B, the point goes to the player who plays the second card.

- Since I go first, and we take turns alternately, I need to see how many of these k numbers I can make Nene play the second card.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of selecting which cards to play when, considering that Nene is also playing optimally.

This seems tricky.

Let’s consider that for numbers in B, the player who plays the second card gets the point.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of numbers in B where I play the second card.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points, which includes playing the second card for as many numbers in B as possible.

Wait, but Nene only has cards from B and N.

Wait, no, Nene has cards from N and B.

Similarly, I have cards from M and B.

Wait, no:

- M: I have both cards, Nene has none.

- N: Nene has both cards, I have none.

- B: I have one card, Nene has one card.

So, for M, I will play both cards and get the point.

For N, Nene will play both cards and get the point.

For B, it depends on who plays the second card.

So, my total points are |M| plus the number of numbers in B where I play the second card.

Nene's total points are |N| plus the number of numbers in B where she plays the second card.

Our goal is to maximize my points, which is |M| plus the number of B where I play the second card.

Nene is trying to minimize that.

So, it's a zero-sum game.

Let’s think about the game in terms of selecting the order of playing cards from B.

Wait, but I also have to play cards from M, if any.

Similarly, Nene has to play cards from N, if any, and cards from B.

I need to interleave the playing of M and B cards in a way that maximizes the number of B where I play the second card.

But Nene is also trying to minimize that.

This seems like a complex interaction.

Maybe I can model it using the concept of "degrees of freedom" or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of graph matching or some combinatorial optimization.

But I need a more straightforward approach.

Let’s consider the total number of points available from B.

There are k = |B| points available from B, each going to the player who plays the second card for that number.

Since there are 2n turns, with me starting, and each player playing n times, I need to see how many of these k points I can secure.

But it's not straightforward because Nene is playing optimally against me.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of "pairs" I can create in B.

Wait, no, the pairs are already defined in B.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting which cards to play when, to maximize the number of B where I play the second card.

But with large n, I need an efficient way.

Let’s try to find a pattern or formula.

Let’s consider some small examples.

Example 1:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, M = {1}, since I have both 1's.

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

So, N = {4}, since Nene has both 4's.

B = {2,3}, since for 2 and 3, each has one card with me and one with Nene.

So, my points: |M| = 1, plus the number of B where I play the second card.

Nene's points: |N| = 1, plus the number of B where she plays the second card.

Total B = 2.

In the example, it says that I can get 1 point, and Nene gets 3 points.

Wait, total points from B are 2 points, one for each number in B.

So, in this case, I get 1 (from M) plus 0 from B, total 1 point.

Nene gets 1 (from N) plus 2 from B, total 3 points.

So, in this case, I couldn't get any points from B.

I need to see if I could have gotten 1 point from B.

Let’s see:

If I play 1 first, then Nene plays something, say 4.

Then, I play 1 again and get a point.

Then, Nene plays 4 again and gets a point.

Then, I play 2, no point.

Nene plays 2, gets a point.

I play 3, no point.

Nene plays 3, gets a point.

So, I get 1 point from M, and 0 from B.

Is there a way for me to get 1 point from B?

Suppose I play 2 first.

Nene plays 4.

I play 1.

Nene plays 1, gets a point.

I play 3.

Nene plays 4, gets a point.

I play 2, get a point.

Nene plays 3, gets a point.

So, I get 1 from M and 1 from B, total 2.

But in the example, it says I can get only 1 point.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the first scenario, I get 1 point from M and 0 from B, total 1.

In the second scenario, I get 1 from M and 1 from B, total 2.

But the example says the answer is 1.

Wait, maybe Nene can prevent me from getting that point.

If Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, perhaps in the second scenario, Nene would play differently.

Let’s see:

I play 2.

Nene plays 2, gets a point.

I play 1.

Nene plays 1, gets a point.

I play 3.

Nene plays 3, gets a point.

Alternatively, Nene could play 4 instead of 2.

So, I play 2.

Nene plays 4.

I play 1.

Nene plays 1, gets a point.

I play 3.

Nene plays 4, gets a point.

I play 2, get a point.

Nene plays 3, gets a point.

So, I get 1 from M and 1 from B, total 2.

Nene gets 1 from N and 2 from B, total 3.

But in the example, it says the answer is 1, meaning that Nene can prevent me from getting that extra point.

Wait, perhaps Nene can play in a way that I don't get the point from B.

Let’s see:

I play 2.

Nene plays 2, gets a point.

Now, I have to play 1.

Nene plays 1, gets a point.

I play 3.

Nene plays 3, gets a point.

So, I only get 1 from M.

Wait, but in this case, Nene played 2 immediately when I played 2.

So, she got the point from B.

In my earlier scenario, I played 2, Nene played 4, then I played 1, Nene played 1, then I played 3, Nene played 4, then I played 2 and got the point.

But Nene could have chosen to play 2 immediately to get the point from B.

So, perhaps Nene can choose to play her B cards in a way that minimizes my points from B.

Given that, perhaps in this example, I can't get more than 1 point.

Wait, but in the second scenario, I got 2 points.

Maybe the answer is 2 for this test case, but the example says 1.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Wait, in the example, it says:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

Wait, so for the first test case, n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], output is 1.

So, perhaps in that specific scenario, I can't get more than 1 point.

But in my second scenario, I got 2 points.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the first scenario:

- I play 1, no point.

- Nene plays 4, no point.

- I play 1, get a point.

- Nene plays 4, get a point.

- I play 2, no point.

- Nene plays 2, get a point.

- I play 3, no point.

- Nene plays 3, get a point.

Total: I get 1 point, Nene gets 3 points.

In the second scenario:

- I play 2, no point.

- Nene plays 2, get a point.

- I play 1, no point.

- Nene plays 1, get a point.

- I play 3, no point.

- Nene plays 3, get a point.

Total: I get 0 from B plus 1 from M, total 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought of another sequence where I get 2 points.

Wait, perhaps that's not possible, or perhaps Nene can react in a way that prevents me from getting that extra point.

Given that, perhaps the maximum I can get is 1 point.

But in the second test case, n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], output is 2.

So, perhaps in some cases, I can get more points from B.

Wait, in the first test case, perhaps I can't get more than 1 point, but in the second test case, I can get 2 points.

So, I need to find a general way to calculate the maximum points I can get from B.

Let’s think differently.

Let’s consider the numbers in B.

For each number in B, the point goes to the player who plays the second card.

Since I go first, and we take turns alternately, I need to see how many of these B numbers I can make Nene play the second card.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the parity of the positions.

Let’s consider that.

Suppose there are k numbers in B.

Each number in B requires two turns: one from me and one from Nene.

So, for each number in B, Nene can play the second card.

Wait, but I can try to play my B cards in such a way that Nene is forced to play her B cards in a way that I can play the second card for some of them.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the number of B cards I have and the number of turns I have.

Wait, I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

I have some B cards and some M cards.

Similarly, Nene has some B cards and some N cards.

I need to schedule my plays in a way that maximizes the number of B where I play the second card.

But this seems too involved.

Let’s look for a pattern or a formula.

Looking at the example:

First test case: n=4, M={1}, N={4}, B={2,3}.

Output is 1, which is |M| + 0.

Second test case: n=8, M={8}, N={?}, B={?}.

Wait, in the second test case, n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5].

So, M={8}, since I have two 8's.

Nene has the remaining cards: those not in a[].

Wait, no, M is the set of numbers where I have both cards.

From a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], counts are:

7:1, 4:1, 1:1, 2:1, 8:2, 5:2.

So, M={8,5}, since I have two 8's and two 5's.

Nene has the remaining numbers: 1,2,4,7.

Wait, but 1 and 2 appear only once in a[], so Nene has one of them.

Wait, but the problem says each number appears at most twice in a[], since there are 2n cards and each number appears exactly twice.

Wait, but in this input, n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], so numbers 1,2,4,7 appear once in a[], meaning Nene has the other copy.

Numbers 5 and 8 appear twice in a[], so Nene has none of them.

So, M={5,8}, N={1,2,4,7}, B={}.

Wait, but that can't be, because n=8, so numbers from 1 to 8 should be present.

Wait, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], so numbers 1,2,4,5,7,8 are present, with counts:

1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 5:2, 7:1, 8:2.

So, M={5,8}, since I have two of them.

Nene has the remaining cards: 1,2,4,7, and one each of 5 and 8, but since I have both of 5 and 8, Nene has none of them.

Wait, no, since total of each number is two, if I have two of 5 and 8, Nene has none of them.

So, Nene has one each of 1,2,4,7.

Wait, but n=8, so numbers 3 and 6 are missing from a[], which means I have zero of them, so Nene has two of them.

So, M={5,8}, N={3,6}, B={1,2,4,7}.

So, |M|=2, and from B, there are 4 numbers.

In the output, it's 2, which is |M| + 0.

But according to the example, output is 2.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that in the second test case, I can get 2 points.

Wait, perhaps I misread the output.

Wait, the output is:

1

2

1

0

0

So, for the second test case, output is 2.

So, perhaps I can get 2 points: 2 from M and 0 from B.

Wait, no, M={5,8}, so |M|=2, and from B, I get 0 points.

Total is 2, which matches the output.

But in the explanation, it says that I can get 2 points.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the explanation for the first test case, it says that I can get 1 point, which is |M|=1 plus 0 from B.

In the second test case, I get |M|=2 plus 0 from B.

Wait, but maybe in some cases, I can get points from B.

Looking at the third test case: n=8, a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], which is counts:

7:1,1:1,4:2,5:1,3:1,2:1,6:1.

So, M={4}, since I have two 4's.

Nene has the remaining numbers: 1,2,3,5,6,7, with one each.

So, N={?}, B={?}.

Wait, numbers 1,2,3,5,6,7 have one with me and one with Nene.

So, M={4}, N={}, B={1,2,3,5,6,7}.

Wait, but n=8, so number 8 is missing from a[], so Nene has two 8's.

So, M={4}, N={8}, B={1,2,3,5,6,7}.

Output is 1, which is |M| + 0.

Wait, but in this case, |M|=1, and from B, I can get some points.

But output is 1, so perhaps I can't get any points from B.

Similarly, in the fourth test case: n=3, a=[1,2,3], so M={}, N={1,2,3}, B={}.

Output is 0, which makes sense.

In the fifth test case: n=1, a=[1], so M={1}, N={}, B={}.

Output is 0, which is |M|=1, but according to the output, it's 0.

Wait, that seems inconsistent.

Wait, no, in the fifth test case, n=1, a=[1], so M={1}, because I have one 1, but since total is 2 cards, Nene has one 1.

So, M={}, N={}, B={1}.

Wait, if I have one 1, and Nene has one 1, then M is empty, N is empty, B={1}.

Output is 0, which is |M| + 0.

So, I get 0 points.

Hence, in this case, I have M=0, and from B, I get 0 points.

So, perhaps the formula is |M| plus the floor of (|B| / 2).

Wait, in the second test case, |M|=2, |B|=4, floor(4/2)=2, total 4, but output is 2.

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, in the second test case, n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], M={5,8}, |M|=2, B={1,2,4,7}, |B|=4.

If I can get floor(4/2)=2 points from B, total 4, but output is 2, so that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's |M| plus the ceiling of (|B| / 2).

Wait, in this case, ceiling(4/2)=2, total 4, but output is 2, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's |M| plus the number of B where I can play the second card.

But in the first test case, |M|=1, |B|=2, and output is 1, meaning I get 0 from B.

In the second test case, |M|=2, |B|=4, output=2, so I get 0 from B.

In the third test case, |M|=1, |B|=6, output=1, so I get 0 from B.

In the fourth test case, |M|=0, |B|=3, output=0.

In the fifth test case, |M|=0, |B|=1, output=0.

So, in all these cases, I get floor(|B| / 2).

Wait, no.

In the first test case, |B|=2, floor(2/2)=1, but output is 1, which is |M| + 0.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe it's |M| plus the number of B where I can force Nene to play the second card.

But in the first test case, |B|=2, and I can't get any points from B, as per the example.

In the second test case, |B|=4, and I can get 0 points from B, output is 2 which is |M|=2 plus 0.

In the third test case, |B|=6, output=1 which is |M|=1 plus 0.

In the fourth test case, |B|=3, output=0 which is |M|=0 plus 0.

In the fifth test case, |B|=1, output=0 which is |M|=0 plus 0.

So, perhaps I can get floor(|B| / 2) points from B.

In the first test case, floor(2/2)=1, but according to the example, I can't get any points from B, so that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I can get min(floor(|B| / 2), n - |M|).

In the first test case, min(1, 4 - 1)=1, but output is 1, which matches.

In the second test case, min(2, 8 - 2)=6, but output is 2, which doesn't match.

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps I can get floor(|B| / 2) points from B, but in the first test case, floor(2/2)=1, but according to the example, I can't get that point, so perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Nene can prioritize playing her B cards to minimize my points from B.

So, perhaps the formula is |M| plus the number of B where I can play the second card, considering Nene's optimal play.

But I need a way to calculate that efficiently.

Let’s think about it differently.

Let’s consider that for each number in B, the player who plays the second card gets the point.

Since I go first, and we take turns alternately, I can try to schedule my plays to maximize the number of B where I play the second card.

But Nene is trying to minimize that.

This sounds like a zero-sum game, and the solution might be found using the concept of maximal matching or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to choosing which B numbers I want to play for points, and Nene will counter accordingly.

Let’s consider that I have to choose a subset of B, say S, and play the second card for those numbers, while Nene will play the second card for the remaining B \ S.

But I need to maximize the size of S, while Nene tries to minimize it.

Wait, perhaps it's about maximizing the minimum number of points I can get from B.

This seems too vague.

Let’s look for a different approach.

Let’s consider that the game can be modeled as a graph where nodes represent the B numbers, and edges represent possible plays.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of B numbers and the number of turns I have.

I have n turns to play my cards.

I have to play my M cards and my B cards.

Similarly, Nene has n turns to play her N cards and her B cards.

I need to schedule my plays to maximize the number of B where I play the second card.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of B cards I have and the number of turns I have left.

Let’s define dp[i][j], where i is the number of B cards left, and j is something else.

Wait, perhaps dp[i][j], where i is the number of B cards left, and j is the number of turns I have left.

But that seems too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way.

Let’s consider that for each B number, I can choose to play my card early or late.

Similarly, Nene can choose when to play her B cards.

If I play my B card early, before Nene plays hers, then Nene can play her B card later and get the point.

If I play my B card late, after Nene plays hers, then I get the point.

But Nene is trying to minimize that.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of pairing my B cards with Nene's B cards.

Each time I play a B card, I'm pairing it with one of Nene's B cards.

If I play my B card before Nene plays her B card for the same number, then Nene can choose to play her B card later and get the point.

If I play my B card after Nene plays her B card for the same number, then I get the point.

So, I need to arrange my plays such that as many B cards as possible are played after Nene plays her corresponding B card.

But Nene is trying to minimize that.

This seems like a scheduling problem.

Perhaps I can sort my B cards in a certain order to maximize the number of times I play the second card.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let’s consider that I have to schedule all my B cards in my n turns, and Nene has to schedule all her B cards in her n turns.

I need to maximize the number of B where my play comes after Nene's play.

This sounds like maximizing the number of pairs where my play is after Nene's play.

This is similar to counting the number of inversions where my play is after Nene's play.

But I need to think differently.

Let’s consider that for each B number, I can choose to play my card in any of my n turns, and Nene can choose to play her card in any of her n turns.

I need to maximize the number of B where my turn is after Nene's turn for that B.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as choosing a permutation of my B cards' plays and Nene's B cards' plays, and counting the number of inversions where my play is after Nene's play.

But again, this seems too involved.

Let’s think about it in terms of available turns.

I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

I need to allocate my B cards to some of my turns, and Nene allocates her B cards to some of her turns.

For each B, I want my turn to be after Nene's turn.

So, perhaps I need to maximize the number of such pairs where my turn is after Nene's turn.

This sounds like the problem of maximizing the number of non-conflicting pairs.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let’s consider that I have n turns, labeled from 1 to n (my turns are odd, Nene's are even, since I start).

Wait, no, turns are alternating: 1(me), 2(Nene), 3(me), 4(Nene), ..., 2n(Nene if n is even, me if n is odd).

Wait, n turns each.

So, turns are: 1(me), 2(Nene), 3(me), 4(Nene), ..., up to 2n turns.

I need to assign my B cards to some of my turns, and Nene assigns her B cards to some of her turns.

For each B, I want my turn to be after Nene's turn.

So, for each B, it's a pair (my turn, Nene's turn), and I want my turn > Nene's turn.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of such pairs where my turn > Nene's turn.

This seems similar to matching problems.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to finding the number of pairs where my turn index is greater than Nene's turn index.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of such pairs is floor(|B| / 2).

Wait, in the first test case, |B|=2, floor(2/2)=1, but according to the example, I can't get that point.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor((|B| + 1)/2).

In the first test case, floor(3/2)=1, which matches the output.

In the second test case, floor(5/2)=2, which matches the output.

Wait, no, in the second test case, |B|=4, floor(5/2)=2, which matches output=2.

Wait, no, floor(4/2)=2, which matches output=2.

Wait, but in the first test case, |B|=2, floor(3/2)=1, which matches output=1.

In the third test case, |B|=6, floor(7/2)=3, but output=1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's min(|M| + floor(|B| / 2), n).

In the first test case, min(1 + 1, 4)=2, but output is 1.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps it's |M| + ceil((|B| - n + |M|)/2).

Wait, that seems arbitrary.

I need a better approach.

Let’s consider the total number of points available from B is |B|.

I need to divide these |B| points between me and Nene, such that I maximize my points, given that Nene is trying to minimize them.

Since Nene is trying to maximize her points (which are |B| - my points from B), and minimize my points, perhaps there is a minimax theorem I can apply here.

Wait, perhaps it's simply floor((|B|)/2).

In the first test case, floor(2/2)=1, but according to the example, I can't get that point, so perhaps not.

Wait, but in the second test case, floor(4/2)=2, which matches the output.

In the third test case, floor(6/2)=3, but output is 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's min(|M| + floor(|B| / 2), n).

In the first test case, min(1 + 1, 4)=2, but output is 1.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor((|B| + 1)/2) - (n - |M|).

Wait, in the first test case, floor((2 + 1)/2)=1, n - |M|=4 - 1=3, 1 - 3=-2, which is less than 0, so 0, but output is 1.

No.

This is getting too complicated.

Let’s look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that for each B, I can get a point if I play my card after Nene plays her card for that B.

So, for each B, I need to choose a turn after Nene chooses her turn for that B.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of such B's.

This seems like a scheduling problem.

Let’s consider that I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

I need to assign to each B a pair (my turn, Nene's turn), where my turn > Nene's turn.

I need to maximize the number of such pairs.

This is equivalent to choosing a subset of B where the corresponding my turns are after Nene's turns.

This seems similar to choosing a matching in a bipartite graph, where one part is my turns, and the other is Nene's turns.

In this graph, for each B, I can have edges from my turns to Nene's turns where my turn > Nene's turn.

Then, the maximum matching in this graph would give the maximum number of B where I can get a point.

Given that, perhaps the maximum matching is min(number of B, n - |M|).

Wait, but in the first test case, |B|=2, n=4, |M|=1, min(2, 3)=2, but output is 1, so that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor((n - |M|)/2).

In the first test case, floor((4 - 1)/2)=1, which matches output=1.

In the second test case, floor((8 - 2)/2)=3, but output=2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps floor((n - |M| + 1)/2).

In the first test case, floor((4 - 1 + 1)/2)=2, which doesn't match output=1.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's min(floor((n - |M|)/2), |B|).

In the first test case, min(floor((4-1)/2),2)=min(1,2)=1, which matches output=1.

In the second test case, min(floor((8-2)/2),4)=min(3,4)=3, but output=2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor((n - |M| + |B|)/2).

In the first test case, floor((4 - 1 + 2)/2)=floor(5/2)=2, which doesn't match output=1.

No.

This is getting
