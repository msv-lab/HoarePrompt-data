Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bessie has a birthday cake in the shape of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n clockwise. Bessie has already chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y additional vertices. We need to choose these vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals that form triangles. The goal is to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake.

First, I need to understand what it means to form triangles with non-intersecting diagonals in a polygon. In a polygon, diagonals are lines connecting non-adjacent vertices, and if they don't intersect inside the polygon, they can divide it into regions, some of which are triangles.

Given that the polygon is regular, its properties should make things symmetrical, which might simplify some calculations.

Bessie has already chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y more. So, the total number of vertices we can use is x + y, but y can be less than or equal to n - x, as per the constraints.

The problem is to maximize the number of triangular pieces that can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals using these chosen vertices.

Let me think about how triangles are formed in a polygon when diagonals are drawn. In general, for a convex polygon, drawing non-intersecting diagonals divides it into triangles. In fact, for an n-sided polygon, the number of triangles formed is n - 2.

But in this problem, it's more nuanced because only certain vertices can be used for drawing diagonals. So, the triangles are only formed when three chosen vertices form a triangle with non-intersecting diagonals.

I need to maximize the number of such triangles.

Let me consider the vertices that Bessie has already chosen and think about how I can add up to y more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

One approach is to consider the polygon as a circular arrangement of vertices since it's regular. The chosen vertices divide the polygon into segments, and within each segment, I can decide where to place additional vertices to maximize triangles.

Let me try to model this.

First, I'll note that in a convex polygon, non-intersecting diagonals divide it into triangles. The number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2, assuming that the diagonals are drawn in such a way that they maximize the number of triangles.

Wait, no. Actually, in a convex polygon with v vertices, the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals is v - 2.

But in this problem, not all vertices are chosen; only x + y are chosen, and I need to maximize the number of triangles formed by these chosen vertices.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of triangulations of polygons.

In a convex polygon with v vertices, the number of triangles in any triangulation is v - 2.

But here, the chosen vertices are a subset of the polygon's vertices, and I need to triangulate the polygon using only these chosen vertices.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the convex hull of the chosen vertices or something similar.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a set of chosen vertices. If I connect them with non-intersecting diagonals, I can divide the polygon into regions, some of which are triangles.

I need to maximize the number of these triangular regions.

One way to approach this is to consider the graph formed by the chosen vertices and the diagonals drawn between them, ensuring that no two diagonals intersect inside the polygon.

This is similar to triangulating a polygon with some vertices removed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of chordal graphs or something similar, but that might be too abstract for this problem.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Suppose I fix the set of chosen vertices. Then, the number of triangles that can be formed is equal to the number of triples of chosen vertices that form a triangle with non-intersecting diagonals.

But that seems too vague.

Maybe I should consider the following:

- Each triangle is formed by three chosen vertices that are connected by diagonals, and these diagonals do not intersect with any other diagonals inside the polygon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of non-crossing matchings or something similar.

Let me try to look at small examples to get some intuition.

Take the first example in the note: n=8, x=4, y=2, vertices chosen by Bessie are 1,6,2,5.

So, total chosen vertices can be up to 6.

I need to choose up to 2 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

According to the example, the maximum number of triangles is 6.

Similarly, for n=7, x=3, y=1, vertices 6,4,3; maximum triangles is 5.

And for n=4, x=2, y=2, vertices 1,3; maximum triangles is 2.

Looking at these examples, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be generalized.

Let me consider the general case.

Suppose I have x chosen vertices initially, and I can choose up to y more.

The total number of chosen vertices is x + y.

In a convex polygon with v vertices, the number of triangles in any triangulation is v - 2.

So, if I choose v = x + y vertices, the number of triangles would be v - 2 = x + y - 2.

But wait, in the first example, n=8, x=4, y=2, v=6, and 6-2=4, but the answer is 6.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps it's not that simple.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that multiple triangles can share edges, and the total number of triangles is more than v - 2.

Wait, no. In any triangulation of a convex polygon with v vertices, the number of triangles is exactly v - 2.

But in this problem, it seems that the number of triangles can be higher.

Looking back at the first example, with v=6, triangles=6, which is more than v - 2 = 4.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the triangles don't have to cover the entire polygon.

The problem says: "the whole cake does not have to be separated into all triangles; other shapes are allowed in the cake, but those will not be counted."

So, I can have some regions that are not triangles, as long as the triangles are formed by the chosen vertices and non-intersecting diagonals.

Therefore, the total number of triangles can be more than v - 2, because some triangles might be formed within larger regions.

Wait, but in a triangulation, the entire polygon is divided into triangles, and the number is exactly v - 2.

If I allow other shapes, then perhaps I can have more triangles by having overlapping triangulations, but the problem specifies non-intersecting diagonals.

Wait, no, the diagonals must be non-intersecting, but the triangles can share edges.

But in standard triangulations, the number of triangles is v - 2.

So, perhaps the problem allows for a different kind of division.

Wait, maybe I need to consider adding diagonals in such a way that maximizes the number of triangles, even if not all regions are triangles.

For example, in a quadrilateral, if I add both diagonals, I get 4 triangles, but the diagonals intersect, which is not allowed.

But the problem says diagonals must be non-intersecting.

So, in that case, in a quadrilateral, I can have only two triangles by adding one diagonal.

But according to the third example, with n=4, x=2, y=2, vertices 1 and 3; choosing both remaining vertices (2 and 4), I can have two triangles: (1,2,3) and (1,3,4).

But in this case, the diagonals (1,3) and (2,4) do not intersect, so it's allowed.

So, perhaps the number of triangles can be more than v - 2 if the chosen vertices allow for multiple non-intersecting diagonals that create additional triangles.

Wait, but in this case, with v=4, x=2, y=2, choosing all 4 vertices, the number of triangles is 2, which is equal to v - 2 = 2.

But in the first example, with v=6, the number is 6, which is more than v - 2 = 4.

So, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I need to consider the number of triangles formed by choosing y additional vertices optimally.

Perhaps there's a formula or a way to calculate the maximum number based on the gaps between the chosen vertices.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to be attempting something like that.

Let me analyze the code step by step to understand its logic.

The function func_1() is defined to handle each test case.

First, it reads n, x, y and the list of x chosen vertices.

It then sorts the list and converts the vertices to numbers from 0 to n-1 for convenience.

It calculates the initial number of triangles as ans = x - 2.

Then, it iterates through each chosen vertex and checks if the next two vertices (in the sorted order, considering the circular nature) are such that one is chosen and the other is not, incrementing ans if that's the case.

After that, it calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and stores them in a list called gaps, sorts them, and then iterates through them to add to ans based on the available y.

Specifically, for each gap, it calculates how many pairs of vertices can be added in that gap, given by gap // 2, and uses y accordingly to add to ans.

Finally, it prints ans.

I need to verify if this logic correctly maximizes the number of triangular pieces.

Let me consider the first example again: n=8, x=4, y=2, chosen vertices: 1,6,2,5 (converted to 0,5,1,4 in 0-based indexing).

After sorting: 0,1,4,5.

The initial ans is x - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.

Then, for each vertex:

- For 0: next two are 1 and then 4 (since it's circular). 1 is chosen, 4 is chosen. Condition not met.

- For 1: next two are 4 and then 5. 4 is chosen, 5 is chosen. Condition not met.

- For 4: next two are 5 and then 0. 5 is chosen, 0 is chosen. Condition not met.

- For 5: next two are 0 and then 1. 0 is chosen, 1 is chosen. Condition not met.

So, ans remains 2.

Then, calculate gaps:

- Between 0 and 1: gap=1-0-1=0

- Between 1 and 4: gap=4-1-1=2

- Between 4 and 5: gap=5-4-1=0

- Between 5 and 0: gap=0+8-5-1=2

So, gaps are 0,2,0,2. Sorting them: 0,0,2,2.

Then, for each gap:

- First gap=0: pairs=0//2=0. y remains 2.

- Second gap=0: pairs=0//2=0. y remains 2.

- Third gap=2: pairs=2//2=1. If y >=1, ans +=2, y -=1. So ans=2+2=4, y=1.

- Fourth gap=2: pairs=2//2=1. y >=1, ans +=2, y -=1. So ans=4+2=6, y=0.

Then, it prints ans=6, which matches the first example.

Similarly, for the second example: n=7, x=3, y=1, chosen vertices:6,4,3 (0-based:5,3,2). Sorted:2,3,5.

ans =3-2=1.

Then, for each vertex:

- 2: next two are 3 and then 5. Both chosen. No increment.

- 3: next two are 5 and then 2 (circular). Both chosen. No increment.

- 5: next two are 2 and then 3. Both chosen. No increment.

So, ans=1.

Gaps:

- Between 2 and 3: gap=3-2-1=0

- Between 3 and 5: gap=5-3-1=1

- Between 5 and 2: gap=2+7-5-1=3

So, gaps=[0,1,3]. Sorted:0,1,3.

Then, for each gap:

- gap=0: pairs=0//2=0. y remains 1.

- gap=1: pairs=1//2=0. y remains 1.

- gap=3: pairs=3//2=1. y >=1, ans +=2, y -=1. So ans=1+2=3, y=0.

But in the example, the output is 5, not 3. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the second example, the output is 5, but according to this, ans=1+2=3 from the gaps, which doesn't match. There must be something wrong in my understanding.

Wait, looking back at the code, after the initial ans = x - 2, it adds something based on the next two vertices.

In the second example, n=7, x=3, y=1, chosen vertices:6,4,3 (0-based:5,3,2). Sorted:2,3,5.

Then, for each i in range(x):

t1 = (a[i]+1)%n

t2 = (a[i]+2)%n

if t1 not in present and t2 in present:

ans +=1

So, for i=0, a[0]=2:

t1=(2+1)%7=3, which is in present.

t2=(2+2)%7=4, which is not in present. So, t1 in present and t2 not in present, so ans +=1. Now ans=2.

For i=1, a[1]=3:

t1=(3+1)%7=4, not in present.

t2=(3+2)%7=5, which is in present.

So, t1 not in present and t2 in present, ans +=1. Now ans=3.

For i=2, a[2]=5:

t1=(5+1)%7=6, not in present.

t2=(5+2)%7=0, which is not in present. Condition not met.

So, ans=3.

Then, gaps:

Between 2 and 3: gap=3-2-1=0

Between 3 and 5: gap=5-3-1=1

Between 5 and 2: gap=2+7-5-1=3

Gaps:0,1,3 sorted.

Then, for gap=0: pairs=0, no change.

gap=1: pairs=0, no change.

gap=3: pairs=1, y>=1, ans +=2, y-=1. So ans=3+2=5, y=0.

Which matches the second example's output of 5.

So, perhaps the logic is correct.

Similarly, for the third example: n=4, x=2, y=2, chosen vertices:1,3 (0-based:0,2).

sorted:0,2.

ans =2-2=0.

Then, for each i:

i=0, a[0]=0:

t1=(0+1)%4=1, not in present.

t2=(0+2)%4=2, in present.

So, t1 not in present and t2 in present, ans +=1. Now ans=1.

i=1, a[1]=2:

t1=(2+1)%4=3, not in present.

t2=(2+2)%4=0, in present.

So, t1 not in present and t2 in present, ans +=1. Now ans=2.

Gaps:

Between 0 and 2: gap=2-0-1=1

Between 2 and 0: gap=0+4-2-1=1

So, gaps=[1,1] sorted.

Then, for gap=1: pairs=1//2=0, no change.

gap=1: pairs=1//2=0, no change.

So, ans=2, which matches the third example.

Therefore, the code seems to be correctly calculating the maximum number of triangular pieces.

But I need to understand why this logic works.

Let's break it down.

First, ans is initialized to x - 2. This seems to be based on the triangulation formula for a polygon with x vertices, which would be x - 2 triangles.

Then, it iterates through each chosen vertex and checks if the next vertex is not chosen but the one after that is chosen. If so, it increments ans by 1.

This seems to be accounting for additional triangles that can be formed by adding a single vertex in a gap where it can form a triangle with two chosen vertices.

Finally, it calculates the gaps between chosen vertices and sorts them. Then, for each gap, it calculates how many pairs of vertices can be added (gap // 2) and adds accordingly to ans, considering the available y.

This seems to be maximizing the number of triangles by optimally placing the additional y vertices in the gaps to form the most triangles possible.

Given that the code correctly produces the outputs for the provided examples, and the logic seems sound, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
