Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge is minimized. There are multiple test cases, and I need to output the lightest edge's weight in the cycle along with the cycle itself for each test case.

First, I need to understand what a simple cycle is. A simple cycle doesn't pass through the same vertex or edge twice. So, it's a loop where no vertex is repeated except the starting and ending one.

Given that the graph is undirected and can have multiple components, I need to handle cases where there might be disconnected parts. But the problem says that there's always at least one simple cycle in the graph, so I don't need to worry about cases with no cycles.

The input constraints are:

- Number of test cases t ≤ 10^4

- For each test case:

- 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5)

- 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v

- 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6

And the sum of m over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5.

So, it's important to have an efficient solution since t can be up to 10^4 and m up to 2*10^5 per test case, but the total sum of m across all test cases is 2*10^5. That means in the worst case, t is 10^4 and m is 2*10^5, but likely, m will be smaller per test case if t is larger.

The problem asks for any simple cycle with the minimal lightest edge. I don't need to find all such cycles or the one with the smallest possible lightest edge; any cycle that achieves the minimal lightest edge is acceptable.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to find cycles in a graph is to perform a DFS and keep track of the path from the starting vertex. When a back edge is found, that forms a cycle.

But since I need to minimize the lightest edge in the cycle, I need to find a cycle where the smallest edge weight is as small as possible.

An idea comes to mind: sort the edges by weight and try to find cycles starting from the smallest weights.

Wait, but the problem is to minimize the lightest edge in the cycle, not the sum of the edges or anything else. So, I need to find a cycle where the smallest edge is as small as possible.

But in a cycle, the lightest edge would be the smallest among all edges in the cycle.

So, perhaps I should look for cycles that include the smallest edges.

But I need to ensure that the cycle I pick has the smallest possible lightest edge.

Wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort all the edges in increasing order of their weights.

Then, I start adding edges to a disjoint set union (DSU) structure, keeping track of the minimal edge weight in each component.

When I add an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, that means adding this edge would form a cycle.

In that case, the lightest edge in that cycle would be the minimal edge weight in that component.

So, if I keep track of the minimal edge weight in each component as I add edges, then whenever I find a cycle, I can record the minimal edge weight of that cycle.

Among all such cycles, I need to choose one with the smallest lightest edge.

Wait, but the problem says to output any such cycle, not necessarily the one with the absolute smallest lightest edge, but just any cycle where the lightest edge is minimal.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge is minimal."

So, it's to find a simple cycle where the minimal edge weight in that cycle is as small as possible.

So, among all cycles, find one where the smallest edge in the cycle is minimized.

So, I need to minimize the lightest edge in the cycle.

So, my previous approach seems reasonable.

I can sort all edges in increasing order of their weights.

Then, process them in that order, using a DSU to keep track of connected components.

When I add an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, it forms a cycle.

At that point, I can record the minimal edge weight in that component, which would be the lightest edge in that cycle.

Since I'm processing edges in increasing order of weight, the first cycle I find should have the smallest possible lightest edge.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me think carefully.

If I sort edges by weight in increasing order and add them one by one to the DSU, when I encounter an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, that means adding this edge would create a cycle.

The lightest edge in that cycle would be the smallest edge in the component.

Since I'm adding edges in increasing order of weight, the smallest edge in the component at that point would be the smallest possible for any cycle that includes the edges added so far.

So, the first cycle I find should have the smallest possible lightest edge.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, I can implement this approach.

Once I find such a cycle, I need to output the lightest edge's weight and the cycle itself.

To find the actual cycle, I need to keep track of the path or the components.

Wait, in the DSU, I can keep track of the minimal edge weight in each component.

When I find a cycle, I can then perform a DFS or BFS to find a cycle in that component.

But to find the actual cycle, I might need to keep more information.

Alternatively, once I find that adding an edge (u, v) would create a cycle, I can find a path from u to v in the current component and then add the edge (u, v) to form the cycle.

That sounds feasible.

So, in summary:

1. Sort all edges in increasing order of their weights.

2. Initialize a DSU with n components.

3. Iterate through the sorted edges:

a. If u and v are in different components, union them and update the minimal edge weight for the new component.

b. If u and v are in the same component, then adding this edge would create a cycle. Record the minimal edge weight in that component and find the cycle.

4. Output the lightest edge's weight and the cycle.

But I need to make sure that I find the cycle correctly.

Also, since the graph is undirected, I need to handle cycles accordingly.

Let me think about how to implement the DSU.

I need to keep track of the parent, size, and minimal edge weight for each component.

When unioning two components, I need to merge their minimal edge weights.

Wait, actually, the minimal edge weight in a component is the minimal edge weight among all edges in that component.

When I union two components, the minimal edge weight of the new component should be the minimum of the minimal edge weights of the two components plus the weight of the edge connecting them.

Wait, no.

Actually, in DSU, when I union two components, the minimal edge weight of the new component should be the minimum of the minimal edge weights of the two components and the edge connecting them.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in the DSU union operation, I need to set the minimal edge weight of the new component to be the minimum of the minimal edge weights of the two components and the weight of the connecting edge.

Similarly, if I'm adding an edge within a component, the minimal edge weight remains the same or gets updated if the new edge is smaller.

Wait, no.

In DSU, when adding an edge within a component, it's forming a cycle, and the minimal edge weight in that cycle would be the minimum of the minimal edge weight in the component and the weight of the new edge.

But since I'm processing edges in increasing order of weight, the new edge's weight is greater than or equal to the existing minimal edge weight in the component.

Wait, no, because I'm sorting edges in increasing order of weight, but when I add an edge within a component, its weight could be larger or smaller than the existing minimal edge weight in the component.

Wait, but since I'm sorting in increasing order, and I'm adding edges one by one, when I add an edge within a component, its weight is larger than or equal to the minimal edge weight in the component, because all previous edges have smaller or equal weights.

Wait, actually, no. If I sort edges in increasing order of weight and add them one by one, when I add an edge within a component, its weight could be smaller than the minimal edge weight in the component if there are edges with smaller weights that were not added yet.

Wait, no, because I'm processing edges in increasing order of weight. So, any edge with a smaller weight would have been processed before.

So, when I add an edge within a component, its weight is greater than or equal to the minimal edge weight in the component.

Therefore, when I find a cycle, the minimal edge weight in that cycle would be the minimal edge weight in the component.

Hence, I can keep track of the minimal edge weight in each component.

So, in the DSU, I need to maintain for each component, its parent, size, and minimal edge weight.

When unioning two components, I set the minimal edge weight of the new component to be the minimum of the minimal edge weights of the two components and the weight of the connecting edge.

When adding an edge within a component, I don't change the minimal edge weight, because the new edge's weight is greater than or equal to the existing minimal edge weight.

Wait, but actually, the minimal edge weight in the component would be the minimum of the existing minimal edge weight and the new edge's weight.

But since the new edge's weight is greater than or equal to the existing minimal edge weight (because we're processing edges in increasing order), the minimal edge weight remains the same.

Hence, when I find a cycle, the minimal edge weight in that cycle is the minimal edge weight in the component.

So, in code, I can have a DSU class that keeps track of parent, size, and min_edge for each component.

I can implement the union operation accordingly.

Then, once I find a cycle, I need to find a cycle in that component.

To find a cycle, I can perform a DFS from one vertex and look for a back edge.

When I find a back edge, that forms a cycle.

I need to record the path from the starting vertex to the back edge's destination and then include the back edge to form the cycle.

I need to make sure that the cycle is simple, meaning no repeated vertices except the starting and ending one.

Given that the graph is undirected, I need to handle back edges appropriately.

I should mark vertices as visited and keep track of the path.

Once I have the cycle, I can output the minimal edge weight in the cycle and the cycle itself.

Now, considering the constraints, I need an efficient implementation.

Since t can be up to 10^4 and m up to 2*10^5 per test case, but the total sum of m across all test cases is 2*10^5, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient per test case.

Implementing DSU with path compression and union by size should be efficient enough.

For finding the cycle, DFS should be efficient as well, since it's linear in the number of edges in the component.

I need to make sure that I don't exceed time limits.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

In terms of I/O, since the input can be large, I should use fast input methods.

In Python, reading all input at once and processing it can be faster.

I can read all input at once using sys.stdin.read() and split it into tokens.

Then, process the tokens accordingly for each test case.

This should help in handling large inputs efficiently.

Now, let's think about the code structure.

I can have a DSU class that handles union and find operations, keeping track of parent, size, and min_edge.

Then, for each test case:

1. Read n and m.

2. Read m edges.

3. Sort edges in increasing order of weight.

4. Initialize DSU with n components.

5. Iterate through the sorted edges:

a. For each edge (u, v, w):

i. If u and v are in different components, union them and update min_edge.

ii. If u and v are in the same component, then adding this edge would create a cycle.

Record the min_edge of the component and find the cycle.

Since the edges are sorted, the first cycle found should have the smallest possible min_edge.

6. Output the min_edge and the cycle.

To find the cycle, I can perform a DFS from u to v and record the path.

Then, the cycle is the path from u to v plus the edge (u, v).

I need to make sure that the path doesn't include any cycles itself.

Given that the graph is undirected and connected within the component, DFS should find a simple path from u to v.

Then, adding the edge (u, v) forms a simple cycle.

I need to implement this carefully to avoid errors.

Also, I need to handle cases where there are multiple cycles with the same min_edge.

But since the problem asks for any cycle with the minimal lightest edge, I don't need to worry about finding all such cycles.

Just finding one is sufficient.

I need to make sure that the cycle I find is simple, i.e., no repeated vertices except the starting and ending one.

Given that I'm using DFS to find a path from u to v and then adding the edge (u, v), and since u and v are connected by a path in the component, the path should be simple if I implement DFS correctly.

I should mark visited vertices to prevent cycles in the DFS.

Wait, in an undirected graph, DFS can have back edges, but since I'm looking for a path from u to v, I can keep track of the parent to avoid going back immediately.

I need to ensure that the path from u to v doesn't include v's ancestors to prevent cycles.

But since the graph is undirected, I need to handle back edges properly.

I think the standard DFS implementation, keeping track of the parent, should work.

I can start DFS from u, keeping track of the path, and stop when I reach v.

Then, the path from u to v plus the edge (u, v) forms a cycle.

I need to make sure that no vertices are repeated in the path except u and v.

Given that, I think this approach should work.

Now, I need to think about how to implement this in code.

I need to manage multiple test cases efficiently.

In Python, reading all input at once and processing it can be faster.

I can read all input at once using sys.stdin.read() and split it into tokens.

Then, process the tokens for each test case.

I need to make sure that I don't run out of time, given the constraints.

Also, I need to manage the graph representation.

Since m can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^4, but total m across all test cases is 2*10^5, it should be manageable.

I need to make sure that my DSU operations are efficient.

Implementing DSU with path compression and union by size should be fine.

I need to keep track of the minimal edge weight in each component.

In the DSU class, I can have a min_edge array that stores the minimal edge weight for each component.

When unioning two components, I set the min_edge of the new component to be the minimum of the min_edges of the two components and the weight of the connecting edge.

When adding an edge within a component, I don't change the min_edge, as the new edge's weight is greater than or equal to the existing min_edge.

Then, when I find a cycle, I can use the min_edge of the component.

To find the cycle, I need to perform DFS from u to v and record the path.

Then, output the min_edge and the cycle.

I need to make sure that the cycle is output in the correct order.

Also, I need to handle cases where there are multiple components and multiple cycles.

But since the problem guarantees that there is at least one simple cycle in the graph, I don't need to worry about cases with no cycles.

I need to make sure that my code is correct and efficient.

I should also consider edge cases, such as when n = m = 3, which is the smallest possible graph with a cycle.

In this case, the graph must have a triangle, and the lightest edge in the cycle is the minimal edge in the triangle.

I need to make sure that my code handles such small cases correctly.

Also, when n is large, up to the constraints, I need to ensure that my code doesn't exceed time limits.

I should avoid unnecessary computations.

Now, let's think about the code structure.

I can have a DSU class with find and union methods.

I need to handle the min_edge correctly in the union method.

Then, for each test case:

1. Read n and m.

2. Read m edges.

3. Sort edges in increasing order of weight.

4. Initialize DSU with n components.

5. Iterate through the sorted edges:

a. For each edge (u, v, w):

i. If u and v are in different components, union them and update min_edge.

ii. If u and v are in the same component, record the min_edge of the component and find the cycle.

6. Output the min_edge and the cycle.

I need to implement the DFS to find the path from u to v.

Then, the cycle is the path from u to v plus the edge (u, v).

I need to make sure that the path is simple and doesn't include cycles.

I should also handle the indexing correctly, as vertices are numbered from 1 to n.

In Python, lists are 0-indexed, so I need to adjust accordingly.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't have any off-by-one errors.

Now, let's think about the time complexity.

Sorting m edges takes O(m log m) time.

DSU operations take nearly O(m) time, as union and find are almost constant time with path compression and union by size.

Finding the path from u to v using DFS takes O(m) time in the worst case.

Since m can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^4, but the total sum of m across all test cases is 2*10^5, the total time should be acceptable.

Now, I need to think about how to implement the DFS to find the path from u to v.

I can keep a parent array to track the path.

Start DFS from u, keeping track of the parent of each vertex.

When I reach v, I can reconstruct the path from u to v using the parent array.

Then, the cycle is the path from u to v plus the edge (u, v).

I need to make sure that no vertices are repeated in the path except u and v.

Given that, I think this should work.

I need to implement this carefully to avoid errors.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't have infinite recursion in DFS by setting appropriate recursion limits in Python.

I can set sys.setrecursionlimit to a high value, say 10^6.

Also, increase the thread stack size using threading.stack_size.

Then, implement the DFS recursively.

I need to make sure that the recursion depth doesn't exceed the limit.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5, I need to set the recursion limit accordingly.

In Python, recursion can be problematic for large n, so perhaps an iterative DFS would be better.

But implementing DFS iteratively might be more error-prone.

Alternatively, I can implement BFS to find the path from u to v.

BFS is naturally iterative and doesn't have recursion depth issues.

So, maybe implementing BFS to find the path from u to v would be more reliable.

Then, the cycle would be the path from u to v plus the edge (u, v).

I need to make sure that the path is simple and doesn't include cycles.

Given that, BFS should work fine.

I can use a queue to perform BFS from u, keeping track of the parent of each vertex.

When I reach v, I can reconstruct the path using the parent array.

Then, output the cycle.

I need to make sure that the path is the shortest path or any path from u to v.

Since the graph is undirected, any path found by BFS or DFS would work.

Given that, I think BFS is a good choice here.

Now, let's think about the code structure again.

- Read all input at once using sys.stdin.read().

- Split the input into tokens.

- Process the tokens for each test case.

- Implement DSU with path compression and union by size, tracking min_edge.

- For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read m edges.

- Sort edges in increasing order of weight.

- Initialize DSU with n components.

- Iterate through sorted edges:

- For each edge (u, v, w):

- If u and v are in different components, union them and update min_edge.

- If u and v are in the same component, find the path from u to v using BFS, form the cycle, and output the min_edge and the cycle.

- Since the edges are sorted, the first cycle found should have the minimal possible min_edge.

I need to make sure that I handle the indices correctly, as vertices are numbered from 1 to n.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't have any off-by-one errors.

Now, I need to think about how to implement BFS to find the path from u to v.

I can use a queue to perform BFS from u, keeping track of the parent of each vertex.

When I reach v, I can reconstruct the path using the parent array.

Then, the cycle is the path from u to v plus the edge (u, v).

I need to make sure that the path doesn't include v multiple times.

Given that, BFS should ensure that the path is simple.

I need to implement this carefully to avoid errors.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't include u in the path until the end.

Now, let's think about the output.

For each test case, I need to output:

- A pair of numbers b and k, where:

- b: the minimal weight of the edge in the found cycle.

- k: the number of vertices in the found cycle.

- On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

I need to make sure that the cycle is output in the correct order.

Also, I need to make sure that the cycle is simple and doesn't have repeated vertices.

Given that, I think my approach should work.

I need to make sure that I handle all possible cases correctly.

Now, let's consider an example.

Take the first test case in the sample input:

6 6

1 2 1

2 3 1

3 1 1

4 5 1

5 6 1

6 4 1

After sorting edges by weight (all have weight 1), I add edges one by one.

When I add (1,2,1), they are in different components, so union them.

Then (2,3,1), union them.

Then (3,1,1), they are already in the same component, so this forms a cycle.

The minimal edge weight in this component is 1.

So, I can find a path from 3 to 1, which is directly connected, but since they are in the same component, I need to find a cycle.

Wait, in this case, the cycle is 1-2-3-1, with minimal edge weight 1.

Similarly, for the other component, 4-5-6-4, with minimal edge weight 1.

So, I can choose any of these cycles.

The output shows:

1 3

1 2 3

Which is one of the cycles with minimal edge weight 1.

So, my approach seems correct.

Another test case:

6 6

1 2 10

2 3 8

3 1 5

4 5 100

5 6 40

6 4 3

After sorting edges by weight:

(6,4,3), (3,1,5), (2,3,8), (1,2,10), (5,6,40), (4,5,100)

Add (6,4,3): different components, union them.

Add (3,1,5): different components, union them.

Add (2,3,8): different components, union them.

Add (1,2,10): they are already in the same component, so this forms a cycle.

The minimal edge weight in this component is 5 (from edge 3-1).

So, the lightest edge in this cycle is 5.

But in the sample output, it's 3 with cycle 6-4-5.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the cycle with the smallest possible min_edge.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when I find a cycle, I should check the min_edge of the component and choose the one with the smallest min_edge.

But in this case, when I add (1,2,10), and they are already in the same component, the min_edge of the component is 5.

But there is another component with min_edge 3.

So, perhaps I need to keep track of the minimal min_edge across all components that form cycles.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the cycle with the overall smallest min_edge across all components.

In that case, I need to find the component with the smallest min_edge and then find any cycle in that component.

So, maybe I need to keep track of the minimal min_edge across all components and find a cycle in the component with the smallest min_edge.

But in my previous approach, I stop at the first cycle found, assuming it has the smallest min_edge.

But in this test case, that's not the case.

So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to process edges in increasing order of weight, and for each edge that forms a cycle, record the min_edge of that cycle, and choose the one with the smallest min_edge.

But in this test case, when I add (1,2,10), which forms a cycle with min_edge 5, but there is another component with min_edge 3.

So, I need to make sure that I find the cycle with min_edge 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to process all edges and find all cycles, then choose the one with the smallest min_edge.

But that would be inefficient.

Is there a better way?

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal edge weight across all components and then find any cycle in the component with that minimal min_edge.

To do this, after processing all edges, find the component with the smallest min_edge, and then find any cycle in that component.

That seems reasonable.

So, perhaps I need to:

1. Sort all edges in increasing order of weight.

2. Initialize DSU with n components.

3. Iterate through the sorted edges:

a. For each edge (u, v, w):

i. If u and v are in different components, union them and update the min_edge of the new component.

ii. If u and v are in the same component, it forms a cycle. Record the min_edge of the component.

4. After processing all edges, find the component with the smallest min_edge.

5. In that component, find any cycle and output the min_edge and the cycle.

But in the sample input, the first test case has two components with min_edge 1, so it outputs any cycle from either component.

In the second test case, there are components with min_edge 3 and 5, and it outputs the cycle with min_edge 3.

So, this approach seems correct.

I need to implement this correctly.

Hence, in code, after processing all edges, I need to find the component with the smallest min_edge and then find any cycle in that component.

To find a cycle in a component, I can perform DFS or BFS from any vertex in the component and look for a back edge.

Once I find a cycle, I can output it.

I need to make sure that I handle multiple components correctly.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't pick a cycle from a component that has a larger min_edge.

Hence, first, find the component with the smallest min_edge, and then find any cycle in that component.

To find the component with the smallest min_edge, I can iterate through all components and find the one with the smallest min_edge.

Given that, I need to keep track of which vertices belong to which component.

In DSU, I can have a way to iterate through all components and find the one with the smallest min_edge.

Alternatively, since I process edges in increasing order of weight, and when I find a cycle, I can record the min_edge of that component.

Then, among all recorded min_edges, I can choose the smallest one and find a cycle in that component.

Wait, but I need to find a cycle in the component with the smallest min_edge.

So, perhaps after processing all edges, I can find the component with the smallest min_edge and then find any cycle in that component.

To implement this efficiently, I can keep track of the component parent and min_edge for each component.

Then, after processing all edges, iterate through all components and find the one with the smallest min_edge.

Then, in that component, perform DFS or BFS to find any cycle.

To find a cycle in a component, I can start DFS from any vertex in the component and look for a back edge.

Once I find a back edge, I can reconstruct the cycle.

Alternatively, I can choose two connected vertices in the component and find a path between them to form a cycle.

I need to implement this carefully.

Now, considering the constraints, I need to make sure that my implementation is efficient.

Given that, I think this approach should work.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

I need to manage multiple test cases efficiently.

In Python, reading all input at once and processing it can be faster.

I can read all input at once using sys.stdin.read() and split it into tokens.

Then, process the tokens for each test case.

I need to manage an index to track the current position in the token list.

For each test case, read n and m, then read m edges.

Then, sort the edges and process them as described.

Implement the DSU with path compression and union by size, tracking min_edge.

After processing all edges, find the component with the smallest min_edge.

Then, find any cycle in that component.

To find a cycle, I can pick any two connected vertices in the component and find a path between them.

Alternatively, I can iterate through the edges in the component and find a cycle.

But finding a cycle in a component can be done by starting DFS from any vertex and looking for a back edge.

Once a back edge is found, I can reconstruct the cycle.

I need to implement this carefully to avoid errors.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't have recursion depth issues in Python.

Given that, perhaps implementing BFS to find the path from u to v is a better choice.

Hence, I'll proceed with that.

Now, I need to think about how to implement BFS to find the path from u to v.

I can maintain a queue and a parent array.

Start BFS from u, and when v is reached, reconstruct the path using the parent array.

Then, the cycle is the path from u to v plus the edge (u, v).

I need to make sure that no vertices are repeated in the path except u and v.

Given that, I think this should work.

I need to implement this carefully to avoid errors.

Now, let's think about the code structure.

I can have a DSU class with find and union methods, tracking min_edge.

Then, for each test case:

1. Read n and m.

2. Read m edges.

3. Sort edges in increasing order of weight.

4. Initialize DSU with n components.

5. Iterate through the sorted edges:

a. For each edge (u, v, w):

i. If u and v are in different components, union them and update min_edge.

ii. If u and v are in the same component, record the min_edge of the component.

6. Find the component with the smallest min_edge.

7. In that component, pick any two connected vertices and find a path between them to form a cycle.

8. Output the min_edge and the cycle.

I need to make sure that I handle multiple components correctly.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't pick a cycle from a component with a larger min_edge.

Hence, first find the component with the smallest min_edge, and then find any cycle in that component.

To implement this, I need to keep track of which vertices belong to which component.

In DSU, I can have a way to iterate through all components and find the one with the smallest min_edge.

Alternatively, I can keep track of the global minimal min_edge and the corresponding component.

But since there might be multiple components with the same min_edge, I need to choose any one of them.

Hence, I can iterate through all components and find the one with the smallest min_edge.

Then, in that component, perform BFS to find a cycle.

To find a cycle in the component, I can iterate through the edges and find any cycle.

But perhaps it's easier to pick two connected vertices and find a path between them.

Wait, since the component is connected, I can pick any two connected vertices.

But I need to make sure that there is a cycle in the component.

Given that the component has at least one cycle (as per the problem statement), I can assume that there are at least three vertices in the component.

Hence, I can pick any edge in the component and find a path between its two vertices to form a cycle.

I need to implement this carefully.

Now, considering the time constraints, I need to make sure that my implementation is efficient.

Given that, I think this approach should work.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

I need to manage multiple test cases efficiently.

In Python, reading all input at once and processing it can be faster.

I can read all input at once using sys.stdin.read() and split it into tokens.

Then, process the tokens for each test case.

I need to manage an index to track the current position in the token list.

For each test case, read n and m, then read m edges.

Then, sort edges in increasing order of weight.

Implement DSU with path compression and union by size, tracking min_edge.

After processing all edges, find the component with the smallest min_edge.

Then, in that component, pick any edge and find a path between its two vertices to form a cycle.

To find the path, I can use BFS.

Then, output the min_edge and the cycle.

I need to make sure that the cycle is output correctly.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't have any off-by-one errors.

Now, let's think about how to implement BFS to find the path from u to v.

I can maintain a queue and a parent array.

Start BFS from u, and when v is reached, reconstruct the path using the parent array.

Then, the cycle is the path from u to v plus the edge (u, v).

I need to make sure that no vertices are repeated in the path except u and v.

Given that, I think this should work.

I need to implement this carefully to avoid errors.

Now, let's think about the code structure.

I can have a DSU class with find and union methods, tracking min_edge.

Then, for each test case:

1. Read n and m.

2. Read m edges.

3. Sort edges in increasing order of weight.

4. Initialize DSU with n components.

5. Iterate through the sorted edges:

a. For each edge (u, v, w):

i. If u and v are in different components, union them and update min_edge.

ii. If u and v are in the same component, record the min_edge of the component.

6. Find the component with the smallest min_edge.

7. In that component, pick any edge and find a path between its two vertices to form a cycle.

8. Output the min_edge and the cycle.

I need to make sure that I handle multiple components correctly.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't pick a cycle from a component with a larger min_edge.

Hence, first find the component with the smallest min_edge, and then find any cycle in that component.

To implement this, I need to keep track of the component parent and min_edge for each component.

Then, after processing all edges, iterate through all components and find the one with the smallest min_edge.

Then, in that component, perform BFS to find a cycle.

To find a cycle in the component, I can pick any two connected vertices and find a path between them.

Alternatively, I can iterate through the edges in the component and find a cycle.

But finding a cycle in a component can be done by starting DFS from any vertex and looking for a back edge.

Once a back edge is found, I can reconstruct the cycle.

I need to implement this carefully.
