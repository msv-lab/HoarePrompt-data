Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. So, there are two cards for each integer.

In the beginning, the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating between me and Nene, for a total of 2n turns. On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at the number x on it, and then checks if there's already a card with number x on the table. If there is, the player gets a point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Important points:

- The game is played with complete information; both players can see all the cards on the table at any time.

- Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

- I need to play optimally to maximize my score, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

Given that, I need to find out the maximum number of points I can get, assuming I play optimally.

First, I need to understand the mechanics of the game.

Each integer appears exactly twice in the deck, and we both have n cards each.

So, for each integer from 1 to n, there are two cards, and these are distributed between me and Nene.

For example, if n=3, there are two 1s, two 2s, and two 3s, total 6 cards. Each of us gets 3 cards.

Now, we take turns placing one card at a time, alternating between me and Nene, for a total of 6 turns.

The scoring happens based on whether the card being played has already been played (i.e., its pair is already on the table).

So, if I play a card with number x, and there's already a card with x on the table, I get a point.

Otherwise, I just place it on the table without getting a point.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and among optimal choices, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to play optimally to maximize my score, considering Nene's optimal play.

Let me try to think about smaller cases to understand the pattern.

Take n=1.

So, two cards, both with 1.

Each of us has one card.

Turns:

1. Me: play 1. No point (since no 1 is on the table yet).

2. Nene: play 1. Gets a point (since 1 is already on the table).

My score: 0.

Is this the maximum I can get? Yes, because there's only one pair, and I can't get any points.

Another small case: n=2.

Four cards: two 1s and two 2s.

Each of us has two cards.

Possible distributions:

- I have two 1s.

- Nene has two 2s.

Game:

1. Me: play 1.

2. Nene: play 2.

3. Me: play 1, get a point (since 1 is already on the table).

4. Nene: play 2, get a point.

My score: 1.

Another distribution:

- I have one 1 and one 2.

- Nene has one 1 and one 2.

Game:

1. Me: play 1.

2. Nene: play 1, get a point.

3. Me: play 2.

4. Nene: play 2, get a point.

My score: 0.

Alternatively:

1. Me: play 2.

2. Nene: play 1.

3. Me: play 2, get a point.

4. Nene: play 1, get a point.

My score: 1.

So, in this case, depending on the distribution, my score can be 0 or 1.

From this, it seems that if I have two cards of the same number, I can arrange to get a point, but Nene might interfere depending on her play.

Wait, in the first scenario with n=2, where I have two 1s and Nene has two 2s, I can get one point.

In the second scenario, where I have one 1 and one 2, and Nene has one 1 and one 2, I can get one point if I play wisely.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have in my hand.

Wait, in the first n=2 case, I have one pair (two 1s), and I can get one point.

In the second n=2 case, I have no pairs, and I can get zero points.

Wait, but in the second case, I managed to get one point by playing 2 first, then 2 again.

Wait, no, in the second case, I have one 1 and one 2 each.

If I play 2 first, then Nene plays 1, then I play 2 again and get a point, and Nene plays 1 and gets a point.

So, I get one point.

But in this case, I don't have a pair in my hand, but I still managed to get one point.

So, perhaps it's not directly related to the number of pairs I have in my hand.

Wait, in the second case, I have one 2, and Nene has one 2, and similarly for 1.

So, when I play my second 2, there's already a 2 on the table (Nene's 2), so I get a point.

Similarly, Nene gets a point for playing her second 1.

So, in this case, even without having a pair in my hand, I can get a point by playing the second card of a number that Nene has already played.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers that appear twice in the deck, but considering the optimal play from both sides.

Wait, but in the first n=2 case, I have two 1s, and Nene has two 2s.

If I play 1 first, then Nene plays 2, then I play 1 and get a point, and Nene plays 2 and gets a point.

So, I get one point.

In the second case, I have one 1 and one 2, and Nene has one 1 and one 2.

If I play 2, Nene plays 1, then I play 2 again and get a point, Nene plays 1 and gets a point.

So, again, I get one point.

So, in both cases, I get one point.

Is this a general pattern?

Let me try n=3.

Six cards: two 1s, two 2s, two 3s.

Each of us has three cards.

Possible distributions:

Case 1:

- I have two 1s and one 2.

- Nene has one 2, two 3s.

Game:

1. Me: play 1.

2. Nene: play 2.

3. Me: play 1, get a point.

4. Nene: play 3.

5. Me: play 2, get a point (since 2 is already on the table).

6. Nene: play 3, get a point.

My score: 2.

Wait, but according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in this case, maybe Nene would choose to play 3 instead of 2 to minimize my score.

Wait, in this distribution, Nene has one 2 and two 3s.

So, in her first turn, she can choose to play 2 or 3.

If she plays 2 first:

1. Me: play 1.

2. Nene: play 2.

3. Me: play 1, get a point.

4. Nene: play 3.

5. Me: play 2, get a point.

6. Nene: play 3, get a point.

My score: 2.

If she plays 3 first:

1. Me: play 1.

2. Nene: play 3.

3. Me: play 1, get a point.

4. Nene: play 3, get a point.

5. Me: play 2, get a point.

6. Nene: play 2, get a point.

My score: 2.

So, in both cases, my score is 2.

Another distribution for n=3:

- I have one 1, one 2, one 3.

- Nene has one 1, one 2, one 3.

Game:

1. Me: play 1.

2. Nene: play 2.

3. Me: play 3.

4. Nene: play 1, get a point.

5. Me: play 2, get a point.

6. Nene: play 3, get a point.

My score: 1.

Alternatively:

1. Me: play 1.

2. Nene: play 1, get a point.

3. Me: play 2.

4. Nene: play 3.

5. Me: play 3, get a point.

6. Nene: play 2, get a point.

My score: 1.

So, in this case, my score is 1.

Comparing the two distributions:

- When I have two pairs in my hand (two 1s and one 2), I can get two points.

- When I have no pairs in my hand (one of each), I can get one point.

So, it seems that the number of points I can get is related to the number of pairs I have in my hand.

Wait, in the first n=3 case, I have two 1s, which is one pair, and I got two points.

In the second n=3 case, I have no pairs, and I got one point.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have plus something.

Wait, in the first n=3 case with one pair, I got two points.

In the second n=3 case with no pairs, I got one point.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs in my hand plus the floor division of n by 2.

Wait, in the first n=3 case, pairs=1, floor(3/2)=1, total points=2.

In the second n=3 case, pairs=0, floor(3/2)=1, total points=1.

That seems to match.

Another check with n=4.

Total cards: eight, two of each number from 1 to 4.

Each of us has four cards.

Case 1:

- I have two 1s and two 2s.

- Nene has two 3s and two 4s.

Number of pairs I have: two (1s and 2s).

According to the formula: pairs + floor(n/2) = 2 + 2 = 4.

But let's see:

Game:

1. Me: play 1.

2. Nene: play 3.

3. Me: play 1, get a point.

4. Nene: play 3, get a point.

5. Me: play 2.

6. Nene: play 4.

7. Me: play 2, get a point.

8. Nene: play 4, get a point.

My score: 2.

Wait, according to the formula, it should be 4, but in practice, it's 2.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is not correct.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

In the first n=3 case, I have one pair, and I got two points.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in that case, I have one pair, but I got two points.

Another thought: perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have plus the number of numbers that appear in both my and Nene's hands.

Wait, in the first n=3 case with one pair (two 1s and one 2), Nene has one 2 and two 3s.

So, numbers that appear in both hands are 1 and 2.

Wait, no, I have 1,1,2; Nene has 2,3,3.

So, 1 appears in my hand twice, Nene has 2 once and 3 twice.

Wait, 1 appears only in my hand, 2 appears in both, 3 only in Nene's.

Wait, in this case, I have one pair (1s), and one shared number (2).

I got two points in that case.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs I have plus the number of shared numbers.

In this case, pairs=1, shared numbers=1, total=2, which matches the points I got.

In the second n=3 case, I have no pairs, and shared numbers=3 (all numbers are shared since I have one of each), so according to this, points=0+3=3, but in reality, I only got one point.

So, this doesn't hold.

Another thought: maybe it's the number of pairs I have plus the number of unique numbers that appear in both hands, but only considering certain things.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me think in terms of graph theory or combinatorics.

Each number from 1 to n has two cards, one in my hand and one in Nene's, or both in one hand.

So, for each number, there are three possibilities:

1. Both cards are in my hand (I have a pair).

2. Both cards are in Nene's hand.

3. One card is in my hand, and one is in Nene's hand.

Let me denote:

- p: number of pairs I have in my hand.

- q: number of numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card.

- r: number of numbers where Nene has both cards.

Clearly, p + q + r = n.

Now, I need to find the maximum points I can get, considering that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Let's think about how the game progresses.

Each turn, a card is played, and a point is scored if the number has already been played.

So, the score depends on the order in which the cards are played.

Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize mine, given that.

I need to find a strategy that maximizes my score, knowing that Nene will counter me optimally.

This seems like a zero-sum game, and perhaps minimax can be applied here.

But that might be too complex for practical purposes.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula based on p, q, r.

First, consider that for the numbers where I have a pair (p), I can potentially get one point from each, by playing the second card after Nene has played the first one.

Wait, no, if I have both cards of a number, and I play one, then Nene can play the other one and get a point.

But if I play both myself, I can get a point for the second one.

Wait, but Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, she will try to play in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of matching pairs.

Each pair of cards with the same number will contribute one point to the player who plays the second card, provided that the first card has already been played.

So, for each pair, the second player to play that number gets a point.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of pairs where I play second.

But Nene is trying to maximize her score, which means she wants to play second on as many pairs as possible.

Wait, but she only controls her own cards.

I need to strategize my plays considering that Nene will play optimally.

Let me consider that for each number, there are two cards.

If I have both cards of a number, then I can choose to play them in such a way that I get a point from one of them.

If I have one card and Nene has one card, then whoever plays their card second will get a point.

Nene, being optimal, will try to play her card second to get the point, but I can force her to play first if I play my card first.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider which numbers to play first to maximize my points.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a certain number of pairs (p), and the rest are either in Nene's hand or shared.

For each pair I have, I can arrange to get one point by playing the second card after Nene has played hers.

Wait, no, if I have both cards, I can play the first one, and then play the second one to get a point.

So, for each pair I have, I can get one point.

Additionally, for the numbers where I have one card and Nene has one card, I can get a point if I play my card second.

But Nene, being optimal, will try to play her card first to prevent me from getting the point.

So, in such cases, I can't get a point.

Wait, but if I play my card first, Nene can choose to play her card either before or after me.

But since she plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will play her card in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

Wait, in the shared numbers, if I play my card first, Nene can play her card later to get a point.

If she plays her card first, then I can play my card later to get a point.

So, she would choose to play her card first to prevent me from getting the point, since playing first in a shared pair doesn't give her a point, but playing second does.

Wait, no, if she plays her card first in a shared pair, then I can play my card later and get a point.

So, to prevent that, she would play her card second in the shared pair.

But she can only choose the order of her own cards.

So, in reality, when it's her turn, she can choose which card to play.

So, in a shared pair, if I play my card first, she can choose to play her card in a different pair to maximize her points.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of graph matching or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula based on the number of pairs I have and the number of shared numbers.

Let me consider that.

Let p be the number of pairs I have.

Let q be the number of shared numbers.

Let r be the number of pairs that Nene has.

We have p + q + r = n.

Now, for each pair I have, I can get one point by playing the second card after the first one is already on the table.

For shared pairs, I can get a point only if I play my card second, but Nene can play her card second to get a point instead.

So, in shared pairs, I can't rely on getting a point.

Therefore, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, p.

Wait, but in the earlier n=3 case where p=1, I got two points.

Wait, perhaps it's not just p.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum of p and n//2.

Wait, in n=3, p=1, and n//2=1, and I got two points in one case.

Wait, perhaps it's p + floor((n - p - r)/2).

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Nene has r pairs, and q shared numbers.

But I don't know exactly how Nene's cards are distributed.

Wait, actually, I can infer Nene's cards based on my cards.

Given that each number appears exactly twice, and I have certain cards, I can determine which numbers Nene has.

Wait, no, I can't determine exactly which cards Nene has, only the possible distributions.

Wait, but in terms of counting, I can calculate how many numbers have both cards in my hand (p), how many have one card in my hand and one in Nene's (q), and how many have both cards in Nene's hand (r).

Given that p + q + r = n.

Now, I need to maximize my points, considering Nene's optimal play.

Let me consider that for each pair I have, I can get one point by playing the second card after the first one is played.

For shared pairs, I can get a point only if I play my card second.

But Nene can choose to play her card first to prevent me from getting the point.

So, in shared pairs, I can't get a point.

Therefore, my maximum points are equal to the number of pairs I have, p.

Wait, but earlier in n=3 with p=1, I got two points.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, in that case, I had two 1s and one 2, and Nene had one 2 and two 3s.

So, p=1 (two 1s), q=1 (one 2), r=1 (two 3s).

In that case, I got two points.

But according to this, p=1, but I got two points.

So, perhaps it's not just p.

Wait, maybe it's p plus the floor of q/2.

Wait, in this case, p=1, q=1, floor(1/2)=0, total=1, but I got two points.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's p plus the number of shared numbers where I can arrange to get a point.

But in this case, with q=1, I couldn' t get a point from the shared number.

Wait, maybe it's p plus the number of shared numbers where Nene doesn't play her card first.

But Nene will play optimally to minimize my points.

So, perhaps it's p plus the floor of q/2.

Wait, in this case, floor(1/2)=0, p=1, total=1, but I got two points in some play sequences.

So, perhaps this formula is not accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have p pairs and q shared numbers.

Each pair I have can give me one point.

Each shared number can potentially give me one point if I play my card second.

But Nene can play her card second to get her point instead.

So, in shared numbers, I can get a point only if Nene plays her card first, which she might not do.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will try to play her cards in such a way that minimizes my points.

So, for shared numbers, I can't count on getting a point.

Therefore, my maximum points are p plus something related to q and r.

Wait, perhaps it's p plus the floor of q/2.

But in the n=3, p=1, q=1, I got two points, but floor(1/2)=0, so p + floor(q/2)=1+0=1, but I got two points.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's p plus floor((n - p)/2).

In the n=3, p=1, floor((3-1)/2)=1, total=2, which matches.

In the n=3, p=0, q=3, floor((3-0)/2)=1, total=1, which matches.

In the n=4, p=2, q=0, floor((4-2)/2)=1, total=3, but earlier I thought I got two points, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's p plus floor((n - p)/2).

Wait, in n=4, p=2, floor((4-2)/2)=1, total=3, but in practice, I got two points.

So, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps it's p plus floor((n - p - r)/2).

But I don't know r directly.

Wait, r = n - p - q.

So, n - p - r = q.

So, p + floor(q/2).

In n=3, p=1, q=1, floor(1/2)=0, total=1, but earlier I got two points in one scenario.

Wait, perhaps it's p plus ceil(q/2).

In n=3, p=1, ceil(1/2)=1, total=2, which matches the scenario where I got two points.

In n=3, p=0, q=3, ceil(3/2)=2, total=2, but in reality, I only got one point.

So, discrepancy again.

Wait, maybe it's p plus floor(q/2).

In n=3, p=1, floor(1/2)=0, total=1, which matches one scenario.

Wait, perhaps it depends on Nene's play.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Nene will play in a way that minimizes the points I can get from shared numbers.

So, perhaps the points I can get from shared numbers are floor(q/2).

Wait, in n=3, p=0, q=3, floor(3/2)=1, which matches the one point I got.

In n=3, p=1, q=1, floor(1/2)=0, total=1, which matches one scenario.

In n=4, p=2, q=0, floor(0/2)=0, total=2, which matches the two points I got.

Wait, but earlier I thought in n=4, p=2, q=0, r=2, and I got two points, which matches p + floor(q/2)=2+0=2.

So, perhaps it's p + floor(q/2).

Wait, but in n=3, p=1, q=1, floor(q/2)=0, total=1, which matches one scenario.

In n=3, p=0, q=3, floor(q/2)=1, total=1, which matches the one point I got.

So, perhaps the formula is p + floor(q/2).

Let me check with n=1.

n=1, p=1 (both cards in my hand), q=0, floor(q/2)=0, total=1, which matches the scenario where I can get one point.

Wait, but in n=1, if I have both cards, I can get one point by playing the second card.

Wait, but in reality, in n=1, p=1, q=0, floor(q/2)=0, total=1, but in the initial example for n=1, I only got zero points.

Wait, contradiction here.

Wait, in n=1, if I have both cards, I can play one card, and then play the second card and get a point.

So, I should be able to get one point.

But in the initial thought, for n=1, I got zero points.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Let me revisit n=1.

n=1, two cards, both in my hand.

Game:

1. Me: play 1.

2. Nene: has no cards, but wait, n=1, so each has one card.

Wait, maybe I misremembered.

Wait, for n=1, total cards are two, each gets one card.

Wait, the general rule is each gets n cards.

So, for n=1, each gets one card.

So, I have one 1, Nene has one 1.

Game:

1. Me: play 1.

2. Nene: play 1, gets a point.

My score: 0.

So, in this case, p=0 (no pairs in my hand), q=1 (shared number), floor(q/2)=0, total=0, which matches.

Another check: n=2, p=1 (one pair), q=1, floor(q/2)=0, total=1, which matches one scenario where I got one point.

Another n=2, p=0, q=2, floor(q/2)=1, total=1, which matches the scenario where I got one point.

So, perhaps the formula is p + floor(q/2).

Therefore, in the code, we can calculate p as the number of integers that appear twice in my hand.

q is the number of integers that appear once in my hand.

Then, the maximum points I can get are p + floor(q/2).

Wait, but in n=3, p=1, q=1, floor(q/2)=0, total=1, which matches one scenario.

In n=3, p=0, q=3, floor(q/2)=1, total=1, which matches.

In n=4, p=2, q=0, floor(q/2)=0, total=2, which matches.

Seems consistent.

So, in code, I need to count p and q from my hand.

p is the number of integers that appear twice in my hand.

q is the number of integers that appear once in my hand.

Then, the answer is p + floor(q/2).

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Let me check the provided code.

The function func_1 takes n and a list a, which represents the numbers on my cards.

It uses collections.Counter to count the frequency of each number in a.

Then, it counts the number of pairs in my hand: pairs = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)

Then, it returns min(pairs, n // 2)

Wait, but according to my reasoning, it should be pairs + floor(q/2), where q = n - pairs.

Wait, in my earlier notation, p = pairs, q = number of shared numbers.

But in reality, q is the number of numbers that appear only once in my hand.

So, in terms of the code, p = number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

q = number of numbers that appear once in my hand.

So, q = n - p*2 + number of numbers that appear only once.

Wait, no.

Wait, in my hand, for each number, it can appear 0,1, or 2 times.

But since I have n cards, and there are n numbers, each appearing twice in total.

So, for each number, if I have both cards, it's p +=1.

If I have one card, it's q +=1.

So, p is the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

q is the number of numbers that appear once in my hand.

Then, the formula is p + floor(q/2).

But in the code, it's min(pairs, n//2).

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example where n=4, p=2, q=0, min(2,4//2)=2, which matches.

In n=3, p=1, q=1, min(1,3//2)=1, which matches.

In n=3, p=0, q=3, min(0,3//2)=0, but according to the formula, it should be 0 + floor(3/2)=1.

So, discrepancy here.

So, the code is incorrect.

It should be p + floor(q/2), not min(p, n//2).

So, the correct code should be:

from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, a):

counter = Counter(a)

p = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)

q = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 1)

return p + q // 2

But in the given code, it's min(p, n//2).

So, the given code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the initial thought process, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the n=4 case, p=2, q=0, answer=2, which matches min(2,2)=2.

In n=3, p=1, q=1, answer=1, which matches min(1,1)=1.

In n=3, p=0, q=3, answer=1, which matches min(0,1)=0, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be 0 + floor(3/2)=1.

So, the code would output 0, but according to my reasoning, it should be 1.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
