Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. So, there are two cards for each integer.

In the beginning, the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating, with me starting first. Each player plays n turns, so total 2n turns.

On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at the number x on it, and then checks if there's already a card with number x on the table. If there is, the player gets 1 point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Important points:

- The game is played with perfect information; both players can see all cards on the table at any time.

- Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly.

Understanding the problem:

- There are 2n cards, with integers from 1 to n, each appearing twice.

- The deck is split evenly between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

- We play n turns each, alternating, me starting first.

- On each turn, a player picks a card from their hand, checks if its number is already on the table, and scores a point if it is. Then, the card is placed on the table.

- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and, in case of ties, minimize my score.

- I need to find the maximum score I can achieve.

Let's consider a simple example to grasp the mechanics.

Example 1:

n = 1

My hand: [1]

Nene's hand: [1]

Turns:

1. Me: play 1. No 1 on the table yet. No point.

2. Nene: play 1. 1 is already on the table. Get 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 0, Nene: 1

In this case, my maximum score is 0.

Example 2:

n = 2

My hand: [1,1]

Nene's hand: [2,2]

Turns:

1. Me: play 1. No 1 on the table. No point.

2. Nene: play 2. No 2 on the table. No point.

3. Me: play 1. 1 is already on the table. Get 1 point.

4. Nene: play 2. 2 is already on the table. Get 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 1, Nene: 1

In this case, my maximum score is 1.

Wait, but according to the problem's first test case, with n=4 and a= [1,1,2,3], the output is 1, which matches this scenario.

Another example from the test case:

n=3

a= [1,2,3]

Nene's hand: [1,2,3]

Turns:

1. Me: play 1. No 1 on the table. No point.

2. Nene: play 1. 1 is already on the table. Get 1 point.

3. Me: play 2. No 2 on the table. No point.

4. Nene: play 2. 2 is already on the table. Get 1 point.

5. Me: play 3. No 3 on the table. No point.

6. Nene: play 3. 3 is already on the table. Get 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 0, Nene: 3

So, in this case, my maximum score is 0.

From these examples, it seems that the score I can get depends on how many pairs I can play twice, but Nene is trying to minimize my score.

Let's think about the problem more deeply.

Analyzing the problem:

Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck.

I have n cards, and Nene has n cards.

Some integers may appear once or twice in my hand.

- If an integer appears twice in my hand, I have a pair.

- If an integer appears once in my hand, the other one is in Nene's hand.

Let's define:

- My pairs: integers that appear twice in my hand.

- My singles: integers that appear once in my hand.

Similarly, Nene has her pairs and singles based on her hand.

But since I know only my hand, I need to infer Nene's hand based on my hand.

Given that each integer appears exactly twice, I can determine for each integer whether it's a pair in my hand or a single.

- If I have two cards of integer x, it's a pair.

- If I have one card of integer x, the other is in Nene's hand.

So, I can count the number of pairs I have and the number of singles.

Let’s denote:

- p: number of pairs in my hand.

- s: number of singles in my hand.

Since I have n cards, and each integer appears twice, we have:

p + s = n

Because each pair contributes 2 cards, and each single contributes 1 card:

2p + s = n

From these two equations:

p + s = n

2p + s = n

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

p = 0

Wait, that can't be right. Let's check.

Wait, if p + s = n and 2p + s = n, then p = 0.

But in the examples, p can be greater than 0.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, no, let's think again.

Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck.

I have n cards in total.

Let’s say I have k pairs (i.e., k integers appear twice in my hand), and m singles (i.e., m integers appear once in my hand).

Then, the total number of cards I have is 2k + m = n.

Also, the total number of integers is k + m = n, because each integer from 1 to n is represented by either a pair or a single.

Wait, no. Wait, the total number of integers is n, and each integer appears twice in the deck.

In my hand, I have some integers appearing twice (pairs) and some appearing once (singles).

So, if I have p pairs and s singles, then:

- Number of cards: 2p + s = n

- Number of distinct integers in my hand: p + s

- Since there are n distinct integers in total, the integers that are not in my hand (i.e., Nene's singles) are n - (p + s).

Wait, no. Since each integer appears exactly twice, and I have p pairs and s singles, then Nene has s pairs and p singles.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Total cards: 2n

Each integer appears twice.

I have n cards: 2p (from p pairs) + s (from s singles)

So, Nene has n cards: 2s (from s pairs) + p (from p singles)

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have p pairs, that means p integers are fully in my hand (two cards each).

The remaining s integers are singles in my hand, so Nene has the other single for each of these s integers.

But Nene has n cards in total.

So, Nene has s singles (one card for each of the s integers that I have a single for) and p singles (one card for each of the p integers that I have a pair for, since their other card is with Nene).

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have a pair for integer x, then both cards for x are in my hand, so Nene has no cards for x.

If I have a single for integer y, then Nene has the other single for y.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, if I have two cards of integer x, then Nene has no cards of x.

If I have one card of integer y, then Nene has the other card of y.

So, in my hand:

- p pairs: p integers, each with two cards.

- s singles: s integers, each with one card.

Therefore, Nene has:

- For the p integers that I have as pairs: 0 cards.

- For the s integers that I have as singles: one card each.

So, Nene has s singles.

Wait, but Nene has n cards in total.

I have 2p + s = n cards.

Nene has s cards.

Wait, that doesn't add up because I have 2p + s = n, and Nene has s cards.

But s = n - 2p.

So, Nene has s = n - 2p cards.

But Nene should have n cards.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, no, the total number of cards is 2n.

I have n cards: 2p (from p pairs) + s (from s singles).

Nene has n cards: s (from s singles, one for each of my singles).

Wait, but 2p + s = n (my cards), and s = n - 2p.

So, Nene has s = n - 2p cards.

But Nene should have n cards.

Wait, perhaps I need to express s in terms of p and n.

Given that 2p + s = n, then s = n - 2p.

So, Nene has s = n - 2p cards, which is consistent.

Now, the game proceeds with me and Nene taking turns, me starting first, each taking n turns.

On each turn, a player picks a card from their hand, checks if the card's number is already on the table, and scores a point if it is, then places the card on the table.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and, in case of ties, minimize my score.

I need to play optimally to maximize my score, given Nene's behavior.

I need to model their strategies.

Let's think about the game's structure.

The table starts empty.

Each turn, a card is played on the table.

The key is that a player scores a point if the number they play is already on the table.

So, to maximize points, a player wants to play a card whose number is already on the table.

But, since both players are playing alternately, the choice of which card to play affects what's on the table for the opponent's turn.

Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and, in case of ties, minimize mine.

I need to anticipate her moves and plan accordingly.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the concept of "pairs".

If I have a pair of a certain number, I can play the first one, and then the second one to score a point.

Similarly, if Nene has a pair, she can play the first one and then the second one to score a point.

But, given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, I need to consider how she will respond to my moves.

Let me consider that each pair can potentially give one point to the player who plays the second card of the pair.

But, since turns alternate, and both players are playing optimally, perhaps there's a way to count the number of pairs and determine how many points each player can get.

Wait, perhaps it's about controlling the number of times a number is already on the table when it's my turn.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that each pair can give one point to the player who plays the second card of the pair.

Given that, the total possible points in the game are equal to the number of pairs in the deck, which is n, since there are n integers, each appearing twice.

Wait, no. Wait, total possible points are equal to the number of pairs, which is n, because each pair can give one point when the second card is played.

But in reality, it's more nuanced because the point is scored when a card is played and its number is already on the table, regardless of whether it's a pair or not.

Wait, but since each number appears exactly twice in the deck, each number can give at most one point, when the second card is played.

So, there are n possible points in the game, one for each number's second card being played.

The total points that can be scored in the game are n.

Me and Nene will split these n points between us, depending on who plays the second card for each number.

My goal is to maximize my points, while Nene tries to maximize her points and minimize mine in case of a tie.

So, it's like dividing n points between me and Nene, and I need to find out the maximum I can get.

Let me think in terms of selecting which numbers I play the second card for.

Wait, but I don't have control over which numbers I can play the second card for, because it depends on Nene's moves.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of pairs I have.

If I have a pair for a number, I can play both cards for that number, and get one point when I play the second card.

Similarly, for numbers where I have only one card, Nene has the other card, and she will play it to score a point.

But, Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, perhaps I can try to delay playing certain cards to influence when Nene plays her cards.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a pattern or formula that can help me compute the maximum points I can get.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Sample Input:

1 1 2 3

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

Sample Output:

0

Let me try to understand the first test case:

n=4

a=[1,1,2,3]

So, I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

Therefore, Nene has one 2 and one 3, and two 4's.

Wait, no.

Wait, total cards: 1 appears twice, 2 appears twice, 3 appears twice, 4 appears twice.

I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

So, Nene has one 2 and one 3, and two 4's.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says Nene has two 2's, three 3's, and two 4's.

Wait, no.

Wait, total cards: two of each: two 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's.

I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

So, Nene has one 2 and one 3, and two 4's.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says Nene has two 2's, two 3's, and two 4's.

Wait, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3 . The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 ."

Ah, so Nene has two 4's and one 2 and one 3.

Wait, but according to the counts, I have two 1's, one 2, one 3.

Nene has one 2, one 3, two 4's.

But in the explanation, it says Nene has two 2's, two 3's, and two 4's.

Wait, that seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the explanation.

Wait, no, let's check:

Total cards: two 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's.

I have two 1's, one 2, one 3.

So, Nene has one 2, one 3, and two 4's.

But in the explanation, it says Nene has two 2's, two 3's, and two 4's.

That doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the explanation.

I'll proceed with the correct counts: Nene has one 2, one 3, and two 4's.

Now, in this scenario, me and Nene will play four turns each.

I need to maximize my points, given Nene's optimal play.

Let me try to simulate the game.

Turn 1: Me

Options: play 1, 2, or 3.

Let's say I play 1.

Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene

Options: play 2, 3, or 4.

She plays 4.

Table: [1,4]

Turn 3: Me

Options: play 1 or 3.

Play 1 again.

Table: [1,4,1]

I score 1 point because 1 is already on the table.

Turn 4: Nene

Options: play 4 or 3.

Play 4.

Table: [1,4,1,4]

Nene scores 1 point because 4 is already on the table.

Turn 5: Me

Options: play 3.

Play 3.

Table: [1,4,1,4,3]

Turn 6: Nene

Options: play 3.

Play 3.

Table: [1,4,1,4,3,3]

Nene scores 1 point because 3 is already on the table.

Final scores: Me: 1, Nene: 2

Alternatively, let's try another sequence.

Turn 1: Me

Play 2.

Table: [2]

Turn 2: Nene

Play 4.

Table: [2,4]

Turn 3: Me

Play 1.

Table: [2,4,1]

Turn 4: Nene

Play 4.

Table: [2,4,1,4]

Nene scores 1 point.

Turn 5: Me

Play 1.

Table: [2,4,1,4,1]

I score 1 point.

Turn 6: Nene

Play 3.

Table: [2,4,1,4,1,3]

Turn 7: Me

Play 3.

Table: [2,4,1,4,1,3,3]

I score 1 point.

Turn 8: Nene

Play 2.

Table: [2,4,1,4,1,3,3,2]

Nene scores 1 point.

Final scores: Me: 2, Nene: 2

Wait, but according to the explanation, I scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 points.

So, perhaps my alternative sequence is not possible, or Nene plays optimally to prevent me from scoring more.

Wait, perhaps Nene would choose to play her 2 before playing 4, to minimize my scoring.

Let me try another sequence.

Turn 1: Me

Play 1.

Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene

Play 2.

Table: [1,2]

Turn 3: Me

Play 1.

Table: [1,2,1]

I score 1 point.

Turn 4: Nene

Play 3.

Table: [1,2,1,3]

Turn 5: Me

Play 3.

Table: [1,2,1,3,3]

I score 1 point.

Turn 6: Nene

Play 4.

Table: [1,2,1,3,3,4]

Nene scores 0 points (since 4 is not on the table yet).

Turn 7: Me

No cards left.

Wait, n=4, so each plays 4 turns.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, n=4, total turns: 8.

Me: turns 1,3,5,7

Nene: turns 2,4,6,8

In the first sequence, I scored 1 point, Nene scored 2 points.

In the alternative sequence, I scored 2 points, Nene scored 1 point.

But according to the explanation, I can only score 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

So, perhaps Nene can force me to score only 1 point.

Let me think about Nene's optimal strategy.

Nene wants to maximize her score and, in case of a tie, minimize mine.

So, in the second sequence I tried, I scored 2 points, which is higher than 1.

But according to the explanation, the maximum I can get is 1.

So, perhaps Nene can play in a way to prevent me from scoring 2 points.

Let me think about it differently.

Each pair in my hand allows me to score 1 point by playing the second card when the first is already on the table.

In the first sequence, I played the pair of 1's to score 1 point.

In the second sequence, I played the pair of 1's to score 1 point and the pair of 3's to score another point.

But in the second sequence, Nene could have played differently to prevent me from scoring the second point.

Perhaps Nene can play in a way that when I play the second 1, she plays a card that doesn't allow me to score again.

Wait, no. Once I play the second 1, I score a point, regardless of what Nene plays afterward.

But perhaps Nene can play in a way to control the table's state for my turns.

This is getting too complicated for manual simulation.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the number of pairs I have.

In the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), and Nene has one pair (two 4's).

Total possible points: n=4, so 4 points possible in the game.

Nene wants to maximize her points and minimize mine.

If I have one pair, I can score one point by playing the second card of that pair.

Nene has one pair, so she can score one point by playing the second card of her pair.

The remaining two points correspond to the numbers where I have singles and Nene has singles.

In such cases, the player who plays the second card scores a point.

Since Nene is playing optimally, she will try to play in a way that maximizes her points from these remaining pairs.

Wait, but these are not actual pairs; these are pairs formed by one card from me and one from Nene.

Wait, no. Each number has exactly two cards: either both with me (pair), one with me and one with Nene (single from each).

In the first test case:

- Number 1: both cards with me (pair).

- Number 2: one card with me, one with Nene.

- Number 3: one card with me, one with Nene.

- Number 4: both cards with Nene (pair).

So, possible points:

- For number 1: I can score one point by playing the second 1.

- For number 2: whoever plays the second 2 scores one point.

- For number 3: whoever plays the second 3 scores one point.

- For number 4: Nene can score one point by playing the second 4.

Total points: 4.

I can score points from:

- Number 1: 1 point.

- Numbers 2 and 3: depending on the order in which we play.

Nene can score points from:

- Numbers 2, 3, and 4.

Nene wants to maximize her points and minimize mine.

In the first test case, the output is 1, meaning I can score at most 1 point.

So, perhaps I can only secure one point from my pair, and Nene can prevent me from scoring from numbers 2 and 3.

Let me think in terms of controlling the table's state.

Each time I play a card, I can choose which card to play when it's my turn.

Nene will respond optimally.

I need to choose a sequence of cards to play that maximizes my points, considering Nene's optimal responses.

This seems too complex to simulate manually for larger n.

I need to find a general formula or algorithm to compute the maximum points I can get.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting to count the number of pairs I have and relate it to the maximum points I can get.

Looking at the function func_1:

def func_1(n, a):

from collections import Counter

counter = Counter(a)

pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))

return min(pairs, n // 2)

It counts the number of pairs in my hand and returns the minimum of that and n//2.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], pairs=1 (only number 1 is a pair), n//2=2, so min(1,2)=1, which matches the sample output of 1.

In the second test case, n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], pairs=2 (numbers 8 and 5), n//2=4, min(2,4)=2, which matches the sample output of 2.

In the third test case, n=8, a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6], pairs=1 (number 4), n//2=4, min(1,4)=1, matches the sample output of 1.

In the fourth test case, n=3, a=[1,2,3], pairs=0, n//2=1, min(0,1)=0, matches the sample output of 0.

In the fifth test case, n=1, a=[1], pairs=0, n//2=0, min(0,0)=0, matches the sample output of 0.

So, in all sample cases, the program gives the correct output.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let's try to understand why this might be correct.

The logic seems to be that the maximum points I can get are equal to the number of pairs I have, but capped at n//2.

Why n//2?

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, n//2=2, but I can get only 1 point.

Wait, but in the program, it returns min(pairs, n//2), which in this case is min(1,2)=1, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the second test case, pairs=2, n//2=4, min(2,4)=2, which matches.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get are equal to the number of pairs I have, but there's some cap at n//2.

But why n//2?

Wait, perhaps because Nene can prevent me from scoring more than n//2 points.

But in the first test case, n=4, pairs=1, n//2=2, and I can only get 1 point.

In the second test case, n=8, pairs=2, n//2=4, and I can get 2 points.

But, is there a scenario where pairs > n//2, and I can't get all those pairs' points?

Wait, in the first test case, pairs=1, n//2=2, and I can only get 1 point.

So, perhaps the minimum of pairs and n//2 is the correct answer.

But I need to verify if this is always the case.

Let me consider another test case.

Suppose n=2, a=[1,1], so pairs=1, n//2=1, min(1,1)=1, which matches the earlier example where I got 1 point.

Another test case:

n=3, a=[1,1,2], pairs=1, n//2=1, min(1,1)=1.

Possible cards:

Total numbers: 1,2,3.

I have two 1's and one 2.

Nene has one 2 and two 3's.

Possible points:

- Number 1: I can score one point by playing the second 1.

- Number 2: whoever plays the second 2 scores one point.

- Number 3: Nene can score one point by playing the second 3.

Nene wants to maximize her points and minimize mine.

If I play the pair of 1's, I get one point.

Nene can play the second 2 to score a point, or play a 3.

Depending on how Nene plays, I might not get more points.

So, in this case, I can get one point, which is min(pairs, n//2)=min(1,1)=1.

Seems consistent.

Another test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,2,3,4], pairs=1 (only 1's are a pair), n//2=2, min(1,2)=1.

Possible points:

- Number 1: I can score one point.

- Numbers 2,3,4: Nene has the second cards for these, and she can play them to score points.

Nene can play optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

But in this case, I can only get one point from the pair of 1's, assuming Nene plays to prevent me from getting more.

So, again, min(pairs, n//2)=1 matches what I can get.

Another test case:

n=6, a=[1,1,2,2,3,3], pairs=3, n//2=3, min(3,3)=3.

Possible points:

- Numbers 1,2,3: I have pairs for all, so I can score 3 points by playing the second card for each pair.

Nene has numbers 4,5,6, each with two cards.

Nene can score 3 points from numbers 4,5,6.

In this case, I can get 3 points, which is min(pairs, n//2)=min(3,3)=3.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,2,3,4], pairs=1, n//2=2, min(1,2)=1.

As before, I can get one point.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but why n//2?

Is there a relationship between n//2 and the maximum points I can get?

In the first test case, n=4, n//2=2, pairs=1, min(1,2)=1.

I can get one point.

In the second test case, n=8, pairs=2, min(2,4)=2.

I can get two points.

Is there a pattern here?

It seems that n//2 represents the maximum points I can get from Nene's pairs.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps n//2 is the maximum points I can get from my pairs and the way Nene plays.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of my pairs and the number of turns.

Wait, n turns each.

Wait, perhaps it's about controlling the table's state.

I'm getting stuck.

Given that in all the test cases, the program's output matches the expected output, it seems that the logic is correct.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
