Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n by n matrix that's initially filled with zeros. Nene can perform two types of operations on this matrix. Each operation allows her to choose a row or a column and assign it a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix after performing at most 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. A type 1 operation lets me choose a row and set its values to any permutation of 1 to n. Similarly, a type 2 operation lets me choose a column and set its values to any permutation of 1 to n. The key here is that each operation completely overwrites the chosen row or column with the specified permutation.

I need to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix. Since each operation can set an entire row or column, I have to strategize how to use these operations to maximize the overall sum.

Let me think about the matrix and how operations affect it. Each cell in the matrix can be set by either a row operation or a column operation. If I perform both a row operation and a column operation on a cell, the last operation performed will overwrite the previous value.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to decide for each cell which operation should set its value: the row operation or the column operation.

One approach could be to decide which cells will be set by row operations and which by column operations, ensuring that each cell is set by exactly one type of operation.

Wait, but I can perform multiple operations, and each operation can overwrite previous values. So, I need to plan the sequence of operations carefully.

Let me consider the maximum possible sum. If I could set every cell to n, the sum would be n * n * n = n^3. But is that possible with the given operations?

Well, each operation sets an entire row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, meaning that in any row or column, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

So, the maximum value any single cell can have is n. But to set a cell to n, I need to perform an operation that sets that row or column to have n in that position.

However, if I set a row to have n in a particular column, and then set that column to have n in that row, it's the last operation that sticks.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

Suppose I have a matrix, and I perform a type 1 operation on row i, setting it to some permutation. Then, if I perform a type 2 operation on column j, it will set the values in that column, overwriting whatever was in row i, column j, with the value from the column operation.

So, the last operation on a particular cell determines its final value.

Given that, to maximize the sum, I need to choose for each cell which operation should set its value, and what that value should be.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the total sum I can achieve.

Each row operation sets a row to a permutation of 1 to n, so the sum of that row is always (n*(n+1))/2.

Similarly, each column operation sets a column to a permutation of 1 to n, so the sum of that column is also (n*(n+1))/2.

If I perform operations on all rows and all columns, that would be 2n operations, which is within the limit.

But, since each cell is potentially overwritten by both a row operation and a column operation, I need to see how the sums interact.

Wait, actually, for each cell, it's set by either the last row operation or the last column operation that affects it.

Hmm.

Wait, no. Actually, each cell is set by the last operation that affects it, whether it's a row operation or a column operation.

So, if I perform a row operation on row i, and then a column operation on column j, the cell at (i,j) will have the value set by the column operation.

Similarly, if I perform a column operation first and then a row operation, the cell will have the value set by the row operation.

So, the order of operations matters.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to look at this.

Let me think about the total sum.

If I perform operations on all rows and all columns, that's 2n operations, which is acceptable.

Now, in this case, each cell is affected by both a row operation and a column operation.

The last operation on each cell determines its value.

So, if I perform all row operations first, followed by all column operations, then all cells will have the values set by the column operations.

In that case, the sum would be n times the sum of a single column, which is n times (n*(n+1))/2, which is n^2*(n+1)/2.

Similarly, if I perform all column operations first, followed by all row operations, the sum would be n times the sum of a single row, which is the same as above.

But I can probably do better by interleaving row and column operations.

Wait, but how?

Let me consider that each operation sets a entire row or column, and I can choose the permutation for each operation.

I need to maximize the sum of all cells.

Another idea: perhaps I can prioritize setting the main diagonal with the highest possible values.

Because the main diagonal cells are the ones that are uniquely identified by both row and column.

Wait, but I need to think in terms of operations, not individual cells.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a row and set it to a permutation that maximizes the sum for that row, without worrying about the columns.

But since columns are also being operated on, I need to consider the interactions.

This is getting messy.

Maybe I should look at the example provided.

In the second test case, n=2, the maximum sum is 7, achieved in 3 operations.

Let me see what that means.

For n=2, the matrix is 2x2.

Operations performed:

1 1 1 2

1 2 1 2

2 1 1 2

So, first operation: type 1 on row 1, with permutation 1 2.

Second operation: type 1 on row 2, with permutation 1 2.

Third operation: type 2 on column 1, with permutation 1 2.

Let's see what the matrix looks like after each operation.

Initial matrix:

0 0

0 0

After first operation (row 1 set to 1 2):

1 2

0 0

After second operation (row 2 set to 1 2):

1 2

1 2

After third operation (column 1 set to 1 2):

1 2

2 2

So, the final matrix is:

1 2

2 2

Sum is 1+2+2+2 = 7.

Indeed, as stated in the example.

Now, is this the maximum possible sum?

Well, according to the problem, yes.

Is there a way to get a higher sum? Let's see.

If I perform operations in a different way.

For example, perform column operations first.

Suppose I do:

2 1 2 1

2 2 1 2

1 1 2 1

1 2 1 2

So, first set column 1 to 2 1

Matrix:

0 0

0 0

After first operation:

2 0

1 0

After second operation:

2 0

1 2

After third operation:

2 1

1 2

After fourth operation:

2 1

1 2

Sum is 2+1+1+2=6, which is less than 7.

So, the order of operations matters.

In the example, they did two row operations followed by one column operation.

Is there a better way?

Let me try:

Perform row operations first.

Set row 1 to 1 2

Set row 2 to 1 2

Then set column 1 to 1 2

Resulting matrix:

1 2

2 2

Sum 7.

Alternatively, set row 1 to 2 1

Set row 2 to 2 1

Set column 1 to 2 1

Matrix:

2 1

2 1

Sum 6.

Not better.

Another way: set row 1 to 2 1

Set column 1 to 2 1

Set row 2 to 2 1

Matrix:

2 1

2 1

Sum 6.

Same as above.

Seems like the first approach gives the highest sum.

Is there a way to get higher than 7?

Let me see.

If I set row 1 to 2 1

Set column 2 to 2 1

Set row 2 to 2 1

Matrix:

2 1

2 1

Sum 6.

Still 6.

Another way: set column 1 to 2 1

Set column 2 to 2 1

Set row 1 to 2 1

Matrix:

2 1

1 1

Sum 5.

Worse.

So, seems like the example's approach is indeed giving the maximum sum.

Now, for n=2, the maximum sum is 7.

Is there a general formula for any n?

Let me try to find a pattern.

For n=1, maximum sum is 1, as given in the example.

For n=2, it's 7.

For n=3, what would it be?

Let me try to construct it.

Perform row operations first:

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum is 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 9*3 = 27.

But, I can do better by performing column operations after row operations.

Wait, I have at most 6 operations for n=3.

Let me try:

Perform row operations:

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum 27.

Now, perform column operations:

Set column 1 to 3 2 1

Set column 2 to 3 2 1

Set column 3 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Sum 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1 = 18.

Which is less than 27.

So, in this case, performing only row operations gives a higher sum.

Wait, but I have to perform at most 2n=6 operations. So, I can do all row operations or all column operations or a mix.

In the previous case with n=2, mixing them gave a higher sum than doing all row or all column operations.

Wait, for n=2:

All row operations:

Set row 1 to 1 2

Set row 2 to 1 2

Matrix:

1 2

1 2

Sum 6.

All column operations:

Set column 1 to 1 2

Set column 2 to 1 2

Matrix:

1 1

2 2

Sum 5.

Mixed operations:

Set row 1 to 1 2

Set row 2 to 1 2

Set column 1 to 1 2

Matrix:

1 2

2 2

Sum 7.

So, mixed operations give a higher sum.

Similarly, for n=3:

All row operations:

Sum 27.

All column operations:

Sum 18.

What if I do a mix?

For example:

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 3 2 1

Set column 1 to 3 2 1

Set column 2 to 3 2 1

Set column 3 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Sum 18.

Worse than all row operations.

Another way:

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set column 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 3 2 1

Set column 2 to 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 3 2 1

Set column 3 to 3 2 1

Let's see step by step.

Start with all zeros.

Set row 1 to 3 2 1:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Set column 1 to 3 2 1:

3 2 1

2 0 0

1 0 0

Set row 2 to 3 2 1:

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 0 0

Set column 2 to 3 2 1:

3 3 1

3 2 1

1 2 0

Set row 3 to 3 2 1:

3 3 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Set column 3 to 3 2 1:

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 3+2+2 + 3+2+1 = 9 + 7 + 6 = 22.

Better than 18, but still less than 27.

So, in this case, performing only row operations gives the highest sum.

Wait, but maybe I can do fewer column operations.

Let me try performing only row operations.

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum 27.

Now, perform only one column operation.

Set column 1 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum 3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1 = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16.

Worse than 27.

Another way: perform two row operations and one column operation.

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 3 2 1

Set column 1 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum 6 + 4 + 4 = 14.

Worse than 27.

Seems like for n=3, performing only row operations gives the highest sum.

Wait, but for n=2, mixing row and column operations gives a higher sum than performing only row operations.

So, perhaps for n=2, mixing operations is better, but for n=3, performing only row operations is better.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me try n=4.

Suppose n=4.

All row operations:

Set row 1 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 4 to 4 3 2 1

Matrix:

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

Sum: 4+3+2+1 + 4+3+2+1 + 4+3+2+1 + 4+3+2+1 = 10 * 4 = 40.

Now, if I perform column operations after that.

Set column 1 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 2 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 3 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 4 to 4 3 2 1

Matrix:

4 4 4 4

3 3 3 3

2 2 2 2

1 1 1 1

Sum: 4+4+4+4 + 3+3+3+3 + 2+2+2+2 + 1+1+1+1 = 16 + 12 + 8 + 4 = 40.

Same as all row operations.

If I mix operations, perhaps I can get a higher sum.

For example:

Set row 1 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 4 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 1 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 2 to 4 3 2 1

Matrix:

4 4 2 1

3 3 2 1

2 2 2 1

1 1 2 1

Sum: 4+4+2+1 + 3+3+2+1 + 2+2+2+1 + 1+1+2+1 = 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 = 32.

Less than 40.

Another way:

Set row 1 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 1 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 2 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 3 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 4 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 4 to 4 3 2 1

Matrix:

4 4 4 4

3 3 3 3

2 2 2 2

1 1 1 1

Sum: 4+4+4+4 + 3+3+3+3 + 2+2+2+2 + 1+1+1+1 = 16 + 12 + 8 + 4 = 40.

Same as before.

Seems like for n=4, performing only row operations or only column operations gives the same sum, and mixing them doesn't help.

So, for n=2, mixing helps, for n=3 and n=4, it doesn't.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me try to generalize.

Suppose I perform only row operations.

Each row is set to the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], so the sum of each row is n + (n-1) + ... + 1 = n*(n+1)/2.

With n rows, the total sum is n * (n*(n+1)/2) = n^2*(n+1)/2.

Similarly, if I perform only column operations, each column sum is n*(n+1)/2, and with n columns, the total sum is the same.

If I mix row and column operations, the sum might be higher or lower, depending on n.

In n=2, mixing gives 7, which is higher than performing only row operations (6).

For n=3, performing only row operations gives 27, which is higher than mixing.

For n=4, performing only row operations gives 40, which is higher than mixing.

So, perhaps for n=2, mixing helps, but for n >= 3, performing only row operations is better.

Wait, but why is that?

Let me think about it differently.

Each cell in the matrix can be set by either a row operation or a column operation, depending on which one is performed last.

If I perform all row operations, each cell is set by its corresponding row operation.

Similarly, if I perform all column operations, each cell is set by its corresponding column operation.

If I mix them, some cells are set by row operations, and some by column operations.

In the n=2 case, by mixing, I can set the diagonal cells to higher values.

Wait, in the n=2 example, the final matrix is:

1 2

2 2

Here, cell (1,1) is set by the last column operation, cell (1,2) by the last row operation, cell (2,1) by the last column operation, and cell (2,2) by the last row operation.

So, cell (1,1) is set by column operation, cell (1,2) by row operation, cell (2,1) by column operation, and cell (2,2) by row operation.

In general, for n=2, this mixing allows higher values in more cells.

But for higher n, performing only row operations seems better.

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical formula for the maximum sum.

Let me consider that.

If I perform only row operations, the sum is n * (n*(n+1)/2) = n^2*(n+1)/2.

Similarly, for only column operations, it's the same.

But in the n=2 case, mixing gives a higher sum of 7, which is higher than 2*3=6.

For n=3, performing only row operations gives 27, which is higher than any mixing I tried.

Similarly, for n=4, it's 40.

So, perhaps for n=2, the maximum sum is different.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is n^3 - (n-1)^3.

Wait, for n=2, that's 8 - 1 = 7, which matches the example.

For n=3, it's 27 - 8 = 19, but in my earlier attempt, performing only row operations gave 27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^2.

For n=2, 8 - 1 = 7.

For n=3, 27 - 4 = 23, but performing only row operations gives 27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps that's not the way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform row operations for the first k rows, and column operations for the remaining n - k columns.

Then, the sum would be k * (n + (n-1) + ... + 1) + (n - k) * (n + (n-1) + ... + 1).

Wait, no.

Wait, the sum from row operations is sum over rows: sum of their permutations.

Similarly for columns.

But it's getting complicated.

Another idea: perhaps the maximum sum is achieved when the matrix is filled with the highest possible values, given the constraints of row and column operations.

But each operation sets an entire row or column to a permutation.

Wait, perhaps the problem reduces to some kind of graph matching or something, but that might be too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula based on n.

Looking back at the n=2 case, sum is 7.

For n=3, if performing only row operations gives 27, but perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe performing only row operations is not always the best.

Wait, for n=2, mixing gives 7, which is better than performing only row operations (6).

For n=3, performing only row operations gives 27, which seems better than any mixing I tried.

But maybe there's a better way to mix operations for n=3.

Let me try a different mixing for n=3.

Perform row operations for rows 1 and 2:

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

3 2 1

0 0 0

Then, perform column operations for columns 1 and 3:

Set column 1 to 3 2 1

Set column 3 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 3

2 2 2

1 0 1

Sum: 3+2+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+0+1 = 8 + 6 + 2 = 16.

Less than performing only row operations.

Another way: perform row operations for rows 1 and 3:

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

0 0 0

3 2 1

Then, perform column operations for columns 1 and 2:

Set column 1 to 3 2 1

Set column 2 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 3 1

2 2 0

1 2 1

Sum: 3+3+1 + 2+2+0 + 1+2+1 = 7 + 4 + 4 = 15.

Less than performing only row operations.

Seems like performing only row operations is better.

Wait, perhaps for n >= 3, performing only row operations is the best strategy.

But for n=2, mixing operations can give a better sum.

Wait, perhaps for even n, mixing helps, and for odd n, performing only row operations is better.

Wait, n=2 is even, and mixing helps.

n=3 is odd, and performing only row operations is better.

But n=1 is odd, and performing only row operations is necessary, since 2n=2 operations are allowed, but only one operation is needed.

Wait, n=1: sum is 1, operations: 1 operation.

n=2: sum is 7, operations: 3 operations.

n=3: sum is 27, operations: 3 operations.

Wait, but according to the problem, for n=1, sum is 1, operations:1.

For n=2, sum is 7, operations:3.

For n=3, if sum is 27, operations:6.

But perhaps for n=3, there's a way to get a higher sum with a different strategy.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is sum_{i=1 to n} min(i, n).

Wait, no.

Wait, for n=2, sum is 7, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 1.

Wait, perhaps it's sum i from 1 to n of i * min(i, n - i + 1).

Wait, for n=2: 1*2 + 2*1 = 2 + 2 = 4, which is not 7.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^2.

For n=2: 8 - 1 =7.

For n=3: 27 -4=23.

But earlier, performing only row operations gave 27, which is higher.

So, perhaps that formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^3.

For n=2: 8 -1=7.

For n=3: 27-8=19.

But performing only row operations gives 27, which is higher.

So, perhaps that's not the formula.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is n^3 - C, where C is some correction factor.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to find a general approach.

Each operation sets an entire row or column to a permutation of 1 to n.

Each cell is set by the last operation that affects it.

To maximize the sum, I need to maximize the value in each cell.

Intuitively, performing row operations for some rows and column operations for some columns can help maximize the sum.

But it's tricky to find the optimal combination.

An alternative approach: think in terms of assigning values to cells based on the operations performed.

Each cell (i,j) can be assigned a value based on the last operation that affects it: either the last row operation on row i or the last column operation on column j.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to choose for each cell whether it's set by a row operation or a column operation, ensuring that each row and column has the highest possible values.

This sounds similar to assigning values in a matrix with certain constraints.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to filling the matrix with the highest possible values, given that each row and column must be a permutation.

But the operations allow setting entire rows or columns to any permutation.

Wait, but there's a dependency based on the order of operations.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look back at the example for n=2.

Operations:

1 1 1 2

1 2 1 2

2 1 1 2

Resulting matrix:

1 2

2 2

Sum:7.

Is there a way to get 8?

If I set row 1 to 2 1

Set row 2 to 2 1

Set column 1 to 2 1

Matrix:

2 1

2 1

Sum:6.

Less than 7.

Another way:

Set row 1 to 2 1

Set column 2 to 2 1

Set row 2 to 2 1

Matrix:

2 1

2 1

Sum:6.

Same.

Another way:

Set column 1 to 2 1

Set row 1 to 2 1

Set column 2 to 2 1

Matrix:

2 1

1 1

Sum:5.

Worse.

So, indeed, the example's approach gives the highest sum.

Now, perhaps for n=3, the maximum sum is 19, not 27.

Wait, but in my earlier attempt, I couldn't get higher than 27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me try to aim for sum=19.

Wait, for n=2, n^3 - (n-1)^3 =8-1=7, which matches.

For n=3, it would be 27-8=19.

Is there a way to achieve sum=19 with n=3?

Let me try.

Perform row operations for rows 1 and 2:

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

3 2 1

0 0 0

Then, perform column operation for column 1:

Set column 1 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 0 0

Sum:3+2+1 +2+2+1 +1+0+0=7+3+1=11.

Less than 19.

Another way:

Perform row operations for rows 1,2,3:

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum:3+2+1 +3+2+1 +3+2+1=27.

Then, perform column operations for columns 1 and 2:

Set column 1 to 3 2 1

Set column 2 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum:3+3+1 +2+2+1 +1+2+1=7+5+4=16.

Still less than 27.

Another approach:

Perform row operations for rows 1 and 3:

Set row 1 to 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 3 2 1

Matrix:

3 2 1

0 0 0

3 2 1

Then, perform column operations for columns 1 and 2:

Sum:3+3+1 +2+2+0 +1+2+1=7+4+4=15.

Less than 27.

Seems like performing only row operations gives the highest sum for n=3.

Wait, perhaps the formula is n^2 * n = n^3.

But for n=2, 8, but the example shows 7.

Wait, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^3.

For n=1:1, n=2:7, n=3:19, n=4:37, etc.

But for n=3, performing only row operations gives 27, which is higher than 19.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's sum_{i=1 to n} min(i,n).

Wait, for n=2: min(1,2)=1, min(2,2)=2, total=3, which is less than 7.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum_{i=1 to n} i*(n - i +1).

For n=2:1*2 +2*1=2+2=4, which is less than 7.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's sum_{i=1 to n} i^2.

For n=2:1+4=5, less than 7.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n*(n^2 +1)/2.

For n=2:2*(4+1)/2=5, less than 7.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's n*(n^2 +1)/2 - C, where C is some correction.

For n=2:5 - (-2)=7, which matches.

But for n=3: 3*(9+1)/2 -C=15 -C.

To make it 19, C would be -4, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's n*(n^2 +1)/2 + floor(n/2).

For n=2:15 +1=16, not matching.

No.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to find a general pattern.

Looking back at n=2, sum=7.

For n=3, if performing only row operations gives 27, which seems higher, but perhaps it's not the maximum.

Wait, maybe the maximum sum is n*(n^2 +1)/2.

For n=2:5*2/2=5, less than 7.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's n*(n^2 +1)/2 + floor(n/2).

For n=2:5 +1=6, still less than 7.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^3 - (n-1)^3.

For n=1:1-0=1.

n=2:8-1=7.

n=3:27-8=19.

n=4:64-27=37.

And so on.

Looking at this, for n=2, it's 7, which matches the example.

For n=3, it's 19.

But earlier, performing only row operations gave 27, which is higher than 19.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum from i=1 to n of min(i, n - i +1) * i.

Wait, for n=2: min(1,2)=1*1 + min(2,1)=1*2=1+2=3, less than 7.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum from i=1 to n of i*(n -i +1).

For n=2:1*2 +2*1=4, less than 7.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's sum from i=1 to n of i^2.

For n=2:1+4=5, less than 7.

No.

This is frustrating.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform row operations for the first k rows, and column operations for the remaining n - k columns.

Then, the sum would be sum of the first k rows set by row operations and the remaining n - k columns set by column operations.

But I need to calculate the overlap correctly.

Wait, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved when k is minimized for n >=3.

Wait, for n=2, k=1, which gives sum=7.

For n=3, k=0, which gives sum=27.

Wait, perhaps for n >=3, performing only row operations is the best strategy.

But I need to confirm this.

For n=4, performing only row operations gives sum=40.

Is there a way to get higher than that?

Let me try mixing operations.

Perform row operations for rows 1,2,3,4:

Set row 1 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 2 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 4 to 4 3 2 1

Matrix:

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

4 3 2 1

Sum:4+3+2+1 +4+3+2+1 +4+3+2+1 +4+3+2+1=10*4=40.

Now, perform column operations for columns 1 and 2:

Set column 1 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 2 to 4 3 2 1

Matrix:

4 4 2 1

3 3 2 1

2 2 2 1

1 1 2 1

Sum:4+4+2+1 +3+3+2+1 +2+2+2+1 +1+1+2+1=11 +9 +7 +5=32.

Less than 40.

Another way: perform row operations for rows 1 and 3:

Set row 1 to 4 3 2 1

Set row 3 to 4 3 2 1

Matrix:

4 3 2 1

0 0 0 0

4 3 2 1

0 0 0 0

Then, perform column operations for columns 1,2,3,4:

Set column 1 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 2 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 3 to 4 3 2 1

Set column 4 to 4 3 2 1

Matrix:

4 4 4 4

3 3 3 3

2 2 2 2

1 1 1 1

Sum:4+4+4+4 +3+3+3+3 +2+2+2+2 +1+1+1+1=16+12+8+4=40.

Same as performing only row operations.

So, seems like for n=4, performing only row operations gives the highest sum.

Similarly, for n=3, performing only row operations gives 27, which is higher than any mixing I tried.

For n=2, mixing gives 7, which is higher than performing only row operations (6).

So, perhaps for n >=3, performing only row operations is the best strategy, while for n=2, mixing operations is better.

For n=1, performing only row operation is necessary, and it gives sum=1.

So, perhaps the general strategy is:

- For n=1, perform one row operation.

- For n=2, perform two row operations and one column operation.

- For n >=3, perform only row operations.

But, I need to confirm this.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says that the maximum sum can always be achieved in no more than 2n operations.

In the example for n=2, they used 3 operations, which is equal to 2n for n=2.

Wait, 2n=4 for n=2, but they used 3 operations.

Wait, 2n=2*2=4, but in the example, they used 3 operations.

So, it's allowed to use up to 2n operations, but fewer operations can also be used.

In the example, they used 3 operations, which is less than 4.

So, perhaps for n=2, using 3 operations is sufficient to achieve the maximum sum.

For n >=3, using n row operations gives a higher sum than mixing.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- For n=1, perform one row operation.

- For n=2, perform two row operations and one column operation.

- For n >=3, perform n row operations.

This seems to be a reasonable strategy.

Now, let's see how to implement this.

First, for n=1, perform one row operation, setting the single cell to 1.

For n=2, perform two row operations and one column operation, as in the example.

For n >=3, perform n row operations, setting each row to the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1].

This should give the maximum sum.

Now, let's confirm the sum for n >=3.

For n >=3, sum is n * (n + (n-1) + ... +1) = n * (n*(n+1)/2) = n^2*(n+1)/2.

For n=3: 9*4/2=18, but earlier I thought it was 27.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, n=3: sum should be 3* (3+2+1) =3*6=18, but earlier I thought it was 27.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, no, for n=3, performing only row operations, each row is [3,2,1], sum per row is 6, total sum is 18, not 27.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 3 +2 +1 =6, for 3 rows: 18.

Yes, that's correct.

Earlier, I thought it was 27, but that was a mistake.

So, for n=3, performing only row operations gives sum=18.

But in the earlier mixed operations, I got sum=16, which is less than 18.

So, performing only row operations gives sum=18, which is higher than mixing.

Similarly, for n=4, performing only row operations gives sum=40, which is higher than mixing.

For n=2, performing only row operations gives sum=6, but mixing gives sum=7, which is higher.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- For n=1: sum=1, operations:1.

- For n=2: sum=7, operations:3.

- For n >=3: sum=n^2*(n+1)/2, operations:n.

This seems consistent.

Now, to confirm for n=3: sum=18.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 27, but that was a mistake.

Yes, n=3: sum=18.

Similarly, for n=4: sum=40.

For n=2: sum=7.

For n=1: sum=1.

So, the general formula for sum is:

- For n=1:1

- For n=2:7

- For n >=3: n^2*(n+1)/2

Wait, but n=2: n^2*(n+1)/2=4*3/2=6,
