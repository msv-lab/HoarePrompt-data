Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nene gave me an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on it multiple times to maximize the sum of the array. The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing the MEX of that subarray, and then replacing the entire subarray with that MEX value. I need to do this no more than 5*10^5 times to maximize the sum of the array and also output the sequence of operations I used to achieve that sum.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX stands for "minimum excluded" value, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. For example, if I have a set {0, 1}, the MEX is 2 because 0 and 1 are already in the set. If the set is {1, 3, 9}, the MEX is 0 since 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

Okay, so the goal is to maximize the sum of the array by repeatedly choosing subarrays, computing their MEX, and replacing the subarray with that MEX value. I need to find the maximum possible sum and a sequence of operations that achieves this sum, using no more than 5*10^5 operations.

Looking at the examples provided:

In the first example:

Input:

2

0 1

Output:

4 1

1 2

So, for n=2 and array [0,1], after one operation on the entire array, MEX({0,1}) is 2, so the array becomes [2,2], sum is 4.

In the second example:

Input:

3

1 3 9

Output:

13 0

Here, the sum is already 13, and no operations are needed because any operation would replace a subarray with its MEX, which might be smaller or larger, but in this case, it seems that 13 is already the maximum possible sum.

In the third example:

Input:

4

1 100 2 1

Output:

105 2

3 3

3 4

So, for n=4 and array [1,100,2,1], after two operations, the array becomes [1,100,2,2], sum is 105.

And in the fourth example:

Input:

1

0

Output:

1 1

1 1

So, for n=1 and array [0], after one operation, it becomes [1], sum is 1.

From these examples, it seems that the operation can be used to increase the sum by replacing subarrays with a higher MEX value, but sometimes it's better not to perform any operations if the sum is already maximized.

Now, looking at the given program:

a = []

n = int(input())

sa = input()

na = sa.split()

for ai in na:

a.append(ai)

func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):

m = 0

if c == 2:

print(f'4 1')

print(f'1 2')

else:

print(f'13 0')

return

So, the program initializes an empty list a, reads n, reads the array as a string, splits it, and appends the string elements to a (note: not converting to integers). Then it calls func_1 with the length of a.

In func_1, it checks if c == 2, and if so, prints '4 1' and '1 2'; otherwise, it prints '13 0'.

Wait a minute, this seems highly problematic. The program only checks if the length of the array is 2, and based on that, it hardcodes the output to either '4 1' and '1 2' or '13 0'. This is clearly not a general solution; it only handles two specific cases: when n=2 and when n is anything else.

But according to the problem, n can be from 1 to 18, and the array elements can vary widely. Hardcoding the output based on n being 2 or not is not going to work for all possible inputs. For example, in the fourth example, n=1, and the output is '1 1\n1 1', but according to this program, for n not equal to 2, it will print '13 0', which is incorrect for n=1.

Moreover, the program doesn't even look at the input array values; it just checks the length and prints fixed outputs. This is not a correct approach to solving the problem.

Therefore, this program is incorrect because it doesn't generalize to all possible inputs; it only handles specific cases based on the length of the array, ignoring the actual values in the array and the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
