Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Sasha wants to earn a lot of money by going to a casino, and he has some initial amount of coins, 'a'. The casino has some rules: when he wins a bet of 'y' coins, he gets 'y * k' coins in return, meaning his coins increase by 'y * (k - 1)'. If he loses, he loses those 'y' coins. Also, there's a promotion where he can't lose more than 'x' times in a row.

The question is whether Sasha can make bets in such a way that he's guaranteed to reach any large number of coins 'n', no matter what the outcomes of his bets are, as long as they don't violate the casino's rules.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what the problem is asking for. We have multiple test cases, each with values of 'k', 'x', and 'a'. I need to determine for each case whether Sasha can, through a series of bets, ensure that he can reach any desired number of coins 'n'.

I should consider the worst-case scenarios to ensure that Sasha can always make progress, no matter how the bets turn out, as long as the sequence of losses doesn't exceed 'x' in a row.

Let me think about how bets affect Sasha's coin count. Each win multiplies his bet by 'k', and each loss subtracts the bet amount. The key is that he can choose how much to bet each time, but it has to be a positive integer not exceeding his current coins.

I recall that in problems involving betting and multiplication, it's often useful to think in terms of multiplying his total coins by factors based on wins and losses.

Wait, but in this case, the multiplication is specific to each bet, not to his total coins. So, if he bets 'y' and wins, he gets 'y * k' in return, meaning his total increases by 'y * (k - 1)'. If he loses, his total decreases by 'y'.

I need to find a strategy for choosing 'y' in each step such that, no matter the sequence of wins and losses (as long as there are no more than 'x' consecutive losses), Sasha can keep increasing his total to reach any desired 'n'.

This sounds a bit like the martingale betting system, where you double your bet after each loss to recoup previous losses when you eventually win. But here, the multiplication factor is 'k', which may not be 2, and there's a limit on consecutive losses.

Let me consider simple cases first.

Take the first sample input:

2 1 7

Here, k=2, x=1, a=7.

The expected output is 'YES'.

So, with k=2, each win doubles the bet amount, and each loss loses the bet amount.

Given that x=1, Sasha can't lose more than once in a row.

So, if he bets 1 and wins, he gets 2, so his total increases by 1.

If he bets 1 and loses, he loses 1.

But since x=1, he can't have two losses in a row.

So, after one loss, he must have a win.

Wait, no. The promotion likely means that the casino prevents more than 'x' consecutive losses, perhaps by forcing a win after 'x' losses. Or maybe it's that Sasha can ensure that he doesn't have more than 'x' losses in a row by choosing his bets wisely.

I need to clarify what "he cannot lose more than x times in a row" means.

Does it mean that the casino ensures that he doesn't have more than 'x' consecutive losses, perhaps by making the (x+1)th bet a win? Or does it mean that Sasha can choose his bets in such a way that he avoids having more than 'x' consecutive losses?

The problem says, "the casino operates under the following rules... he cannot lose more than x times in a row."

I think it means that in any sequence of bets, there cannot be more than 'x' consecutive losses. So, it's impossible for Sasha to have more than 'x' consecutive losses, no matter how he bets.

But the problem is about determining whether Sasha can make bets to guarantee reaching any 'n', given this constraint.

So, perhaps the casino forces that after 'x' losses, the next bet must be a win.

Alternatively, maybe Sasha can choose his bets in a way that ensures he doesn't have more than 'x' losses in a row.

Wait, the problem says, "the casino operates under the following rules... he cannot lose more than x times in a row."

I think it's safer to interpret this as a rule imposed by the casino, meaning that in any sequence of bets, there cannot be more than 'x' consecutive losses. So, if Sasha has lost 'x' times in a row, the next bet must be a win.

Given that, Sasha can plan his bets knowing that after 'x' losses, the next bet will be a win.

With this in mind, Sasha can use a betting strategy where he chooses bet amounts based on the potential sequence of wins and losses, ensuring that he can recover from losses up to 'x' in a row.

Now, I need to find a general strategy or condition based on 'k', 'x', and 'a' to determine if Sasha can reach any 'n'.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case: 2 1 7 → YES

Second: 2 1 1 → NO

Third: 2 3 15 → YES

Fourth: 3 3 6 → NO

Fifth: 4 4 5 → NO

Sixth: 5 4 7 → YES

Seventh: 4 88 1000000000 → NO

Eighth: 25 69 231 → NO

Ninth: 13 97 18806 → NO

From these, it seems that for k=2 and x=1, a=7 is sufficient, but a=1 is not.

Similarly, for k=2 and x=3, a=15 is sufficient.

For k=3 and x=3, a=6 is not sufficient.

I need to find a pattern or formula that can determine the minimum 'a' required for given 'k' and 'x' to be able to reach any 'n'.

Perhaps I can model this as a state machine where Sasha can be in a state of having lost up to 'x' times consecutively, and his bet amounts must be chosen such that he can recover from up to 'x' losses.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a mathematical way to calculate the minimum initial amount 'a' required based on 'k' and 'x'.

Let me consider the maximum potential loss Sasha can face.

Since he can't have more than 'x' consecutive losses, the worst-case scenario is that he has 'x' losses in a row, and then a win.

So, I need to calculate the total loss after 'x' losses, and then the gain from the win.

Let me try to calculate the minimum 'a' required for k=2 and x=1.

In this case, the worst-case sequence is L W (loss then win).

Let’s say he bets 'y1' and loses, so he loses 'y1', and then bets 'y2' and wins, gaining 'y2 * (k - 1)'.

Wait, no, for k=2, winning gives 'y2' in profit.

But in reality, for k=2, winning on 'y2' means he gets 'y2 * 2' in return, so his total increases by 'y2'.

Wait, the problem says "he will receive y * k coins (i.e., his number of coins will increase by y * (k - 1) )".

So, for k=2, winning on 'y2' increases his total by 'y2'.

After losing 'y1', his new total is 'a - y1'.

Then he wins 'y2', so his total becomes 'a - y1 + y2'.

But to make progress, this should be greater than 'a', so 'a - y1 + y2 > a', which implies 'y2 > y1'.

So, to make progress, his second bet should be larger than his first bet.

But he has 'a - y1' coins left after the loss, so 'y2' cannot exceed 'a - y1'.

So, to have 'y2 > y1', but 'y2 <= a - y1', he needs 'a - y1 >= y1 + 1', assuming 'y2 = y1 + 1'.

So, 'a - y1 >= y1 + 1', which implies 'a >= 2*y1 + 1'.

But 'y1' can be chosen freely, as long as 'y1 <= a'.

To maximize 'y1', he would set 'y1' as large as possible, but he needs to ensure that 'a - y1 >= y1 + 1', which again gives 'a >= 2*y1 + 1'.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the worst case, he loses 'x' times in a row, and then has a win.

So, for x=1, k=2, he loses 'y1', then wins 'y2'.

To make progress, 'y2 > y1', and 'y2 <= a - y1'.

So, 'a - y1 >= y1 + 1', hence 'a >= 2*y1 + 1'.

But 'y1' can be up to 'a', so to maximize 'y1', set 'y1 = floor((a - 1)/2)'.

Then 'y2 = y1 + 1'.

But I need to ensure that after 'x' losses and one win, his total is greater than 'a'.

Wait, perhaps I need to generalize this for any 'x'.

Let’s consider x losses followed by one win.

Let 'y1, y2, ..., yx' be the bet amounts for the losses, and 'y{x+1}' for the win.

After 'x' losses, his remaining coins are 'a - sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i'.

Then, he wins 'y_{x+1}', so his total becomes 'a - sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i + y_{x+1} * (k - 1)'.

Wait, no, for k=2, winning on 'y_{x+1}' increases his total by 'y_{x+1}'.

To make progress, this total should be greater than 'a', so 'a - sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i + y_{x+1} > a', which simplifies to 'y_{x+1} > sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i'.

So, the win bet needs to be larger than the sum of the previous 'x' loss bets.

Moreover, 'y_{x+1}' cannot exceed his current coins after 'x' losses, which is 'a - sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i'.

So, 'y_{x+1} <= a - sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i'.

Combining with 'y_{x+1} > sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i', we have 'a - sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i >= sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i + 1', which implies 'a >= 2 * sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i + 1'.

To maximize 'sum_{i=1}^{x} y_i', we need to choose 'y_i' such that this sum is as large as possible, but 'y_i <= a - sum_{j=1}^{i-1} y_j'.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

I recall that in some betting strategies, the Kelly criterion or other proportional betting systems are used to manage bankroll growth.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to consider that after 'x' losses, the next bet must be a win, and plan accordingly.

Let’s consider that after 'x' losses, the next bet is a win, and ensure that the win allows Sasha to make progress.

So, in the worst case, Sasha can have up to 'x' losses in a row, and then must have a win.

Therefore, his betting strategy should ensure that after 'x' losses and one win, his total is greater than his initial amount 'a'.

This seems similar to the martingale system, where you double your bet after each loss to recoup previous losses plus a profit.

But here, the multiplication factor is 'k', not necessarily 2.

Wait, perhaps I can model the total loss after 'x' losses and then the gain from one win.

Let’s denote 'y' as the initial bet.

Then, after 'x' losses, he has lost 'y * (k^{x} - 1)/(k - 1)'.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, for each loss, he loses 'y', and for a win, he gains 'y * (k - 1)'.

Wait, no, for a win, he gets 'y * k' in return, so his profit is 'y * (k - 1)'.

But actually, his total after a win is 'current + y * (k - 1)'.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think recursively.

Define a function f(current) that returns whether from the current amount, Sasha can reach any 'n'.

But with the constraints, this might not be efficient enough, especially since 'a' can be up to 10^9.

I need a smarter approach.

Perhaps I can calculate the minimum 'a' required based on 'k' and 'x'.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

For k=2 and x=1, a=7 is sufficient, a=1 is not.

For k=2 and x=3, a=15 is sufficient.

Let’s see the pattern.

For k=2 and x=1, minimum a is 2?

Wait, in the first sample, a=7 is yes, a=1 is no.

Wait, perhaps the minimum a is x + 1.

For x=1, a >= 2 is needed.

But in the first sample, a=7 is yes, a=1 is no.

Wait, but x + 1 = 2, which matches a=1 being no and a=7 being yes.

Similarly, for x=3, a >=4 should be sufficient.

But in the third sample, a=15 is yes, which is greater than 4.

Wait, but according to this, a=4 should be sufficient for x=3, but perhaps it's not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Looking at the code provided:

def func():

for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

(k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())

if x < k - 1:

if a >= x + 1:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

elif x == k - 1:

if a >= x + 2:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

else:

z = k - 2

for i in range(x - k + 3):

z += z // (k - 1) + 1

if a >= z:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')



So, the code checks conditions based on the relationship between 'x' and 'k - 1'.

If x < k - 1, then a >= x + 1 is sufficient.

If x == k - 1, then a >= x + 2 is sufficient.

Else, it calculates 'z' using a loop and checks if a >= z.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

First test case: k=2, x=1, a=7 → YES

According to the code:

k=2, x=1, k - 1 =1, so x == k -1, so a >= x + 2 =3.

But a=7 >=3, so YES.

But in the sample, a=1 is NO, which matches a >= x +1=2.

Wait, but in the code, when x == k -1, it checks a >= x +2.

But in the sample, for k=2, x=1, it seems a >= x +1=2 should be sufficient, but the code checks a >= x +2=3.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's mentioned that for k=2, x=1, a=7 is sufficient, but a=1 is not.

According to the code, for x == k -1, it checks a >= x +2.

So, for k=2, x=1, a >=3 is required.

But in the sample, a=7 is yes, a=1 is no, which matches.

But is a=2 sufficient? The code would say NO, but perhaps a=2 is sufficient.

Wait, maybe a=2 is also sufficient.

Let’s check:

With a=2, k=2, x=1.

Possible sequences:

- Win: bet y=1, win, total becomes 2 +1=3 (>2)

- Lose once, then win: bet y=1, lose, total=1; then bet y=1, win, total=1 +1=2 (=2)

This doesn't show progress.

Wait, to make progress, after losing once, the next win should make total > original a.

But in this case, after losing y=1, total=1; then winning y=1, total=2, which is equal to original a=2.

So, no progress.

Hence, a=2 is not sufficient.

Hence, a >= x +2=3 is required.

So, the code is correct in this case.

Another sample: k=2, x=3, a=15 → YES

According to the code, x=3, k=2, x > k-1=1, so z = k-2=0

Then, for i in range(x -k +3)=3-2+3=4:

for i in 0,1,2,3:

z += z//(k-1)+1 = z//1 +1 = z +1

So, z starts at 0.

i=0: z += 0 +1 =1, z=1

i=1: z +=1 +1=2, z=3

i=2: z +=3//1 +1=4, z=7

i=3: z +=7//1 +1=8, z=15

So, z=15, check if a >=15, which matches the sample.

Another sample: k=3, x=3, a=6 → NO

According to the code, x=3, k=3, x ==k-1=2? No, x >k-1=2.

So, z =k-2=1

Loop for i in range(x -k +3)=3-3 +3=3:

i=0: z +=1//2 +1=0 +1=1, z=2

i=1: z +=2//2 +1=1 +1=2, z=4

i=2: z +=4//2 +1=2 +1=3, z=7

So, z=7, but a=6 <7, so NO, matches the sample.

Another sample: k=4, x=4, a=5 → NO

x=4, k=4, x ==k-1=3? No, x >k-1=3.

z=k-2=2

Loop for i in range(x -k +3)=4-4 +3=3:

i=0: z +=2//3 +1=0 +1=1, z=3

i=1: z +=3//3 +1=1 +1=2, z=5

i=2: z +=5//3 +1=1 +1=2, z=7

So, z=7, a=5 <7, so NO, matches the sample.

Another sample: k=5, x=4, a=7 → YES

x=4, k=5, x >k-1=4? No, x ==k-1=4.

Wait, k=5, k-1=4, x=4, so x ==k-1.

So, according to the code, check a >=x +2=6.

a=7 >=6, so YES, matches the sample.

Wait, but in the code, for x ==k-1, it's a >=x +2.

But in this case, x=4, k=5, k-1=4, x ==k-1, so a >=6 is required.

Given a=7, YES, matches.

Another sample: k=4, x=88, a=1000000000 → NO

x=88, k=4, x >k-1=3.

z=k-2=2

Loop for i in range(x -k +3)=88 -4 +3=87:

Starting with z=2

Each iteration, z += z//3 +1

This will likely result in z being much larger than 1000000000, so a=1000000000 < z, so NO.

But the sample output is NO, which matches.

Another sample: k=25, x=69, a=231 → NO

x=69, k=25, x >k-1=24.

z=k-2=23

Loop for i in range(x -k +3)=69 -25 +3=47:

Each iteration, z += z//24 +1

This will result in z increasing, but likely z will be less than 231.

But according to the sample, output is NO, which means a < z.

Wait, but if z is less than a, and output is NO, then perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, no, the code checks if a >=z, and if so, prints YES, else NO.

So, if z is larger than a, and output is NO, that matches.

But in this case, z starts at 23, and with z += z//24 +1, it increases slowly.

After 47 iterations, z might still be less than a=231, but according to the sample, output is NO, meaning a < z is not true.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, maybe z becomes larger than 231 after 47 iterations.

I need to simulate it.

Starting with z=23

Iteration 1: z += 23//24 +1 =0 +1=1, z=24

Iteration 2: z +=24//24 +1=1 +1=2, z=26

Iteration 3: z +=26//24 +1=1 +1=2, z=28

...

Each iteration adds 2 to z.

So, after 47 iterations, z =23 +47*2=117.

So, z=117, a=231 >=117, so should print YES, but sample output is NO.

Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, z starts at 23 - k-2=23.

Loop for i in range(x -k +3)=69-25+3=47:

z += z//24 +1

Starting with z=23

Iteration 1: z += 23//24 +1=0 +1=1, z=24

Iteration 2: z +=24//24 +1=1 +1=2, z=26

Iteration 3: z +=26//24 +1=1 +1=2, z=28

...

Indeed, each iteration adds 2 to z.

After 47 iterations, z=23 +47*2=117.

But a=231 >=117, so should print YES, but sample output is NO.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Looking back at the code:

else:

z = k - 2

for i in range(x - k + 3):

z += z // (k - 1) + 1

if a >= z:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, for k=25, x=69:

z =25 -2=23

Loop for i in range(69 -25 +3)=47:

z += z//24 +1

Starting z=23

z +=23//24 +1=0 +1=1 → z=24

z +=24//24 +1=1 +1=2 → z=26

z +=26//24 +1=1 +1=2 → z=28

...

Continuing this way, z increases by 2 each iteration.

After 47 iterations, z=23 +47*2=117

a=231 >=117, so should print YES, but sample output is NO.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code's logic.

Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the loop iterations.

Wait, range(x -k +3) with x=69, k=25: 69-25+3=47 iterations.

Each time z increases by z//24 +1, which is 1 initially, then 2 repeatedly.

Hence, z=23 +1 +2*46=23 +1 +92=116

Wait, z=23

Iteration 1: z=23 + (23//24 +1)=23 +0 +1=24

Iteration 2: z=24 + (24//24 +1)=24 +1 +1=26

Iteration 3: z=26 + (26//24 +1)=26 +1 +1=28

...

Iteration 47: z=23 +1 +2*46=23 +1 +92=116

So, z=116, a=231 >=116, should print YES, but sample is NO.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula used in the code.

Alternatively, maybe the condition for x >k -1 is incorrect.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the code's logic is flawed in this branch.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{false}} \]
