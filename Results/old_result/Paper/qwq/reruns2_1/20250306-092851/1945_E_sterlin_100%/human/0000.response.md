Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Anton has a permutation of size n and a number x that he wants to find using a binary search. But here's the twist: the array isn't sorted, and I can only perform up to two swaps on the permutation before running the binary search. The goal is to rearrange the permutation so that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. For example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, binary search typically works on sorted arrays. Here, we're applying it to an unsorted array, which is unusual. The algorithm described is a bit peculiar. It initializes l to 1 and r to n+1, which is different from the standard binary search where l is 0 and r is n. Also, the condition in step 1 is to stop when r - l = 1, which makes sense because it's trying to converge to a single index.

The midpoint is calculated as m = floor((r + l) / 2). Then, if p_m <= x, set l = m; else, set r = m. This continues until r - l = 1.

The task is to perform at most two swaps on the permutation before running this binary search so that after the search, p_l equals x.

It's guaranteed that two swaps are always sufficient. That's an interesting claim. I need to make sure that my solution adheres to this.

Let's think about how binary search works. In a sorted array, binary search efficiently finds the target by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. But here, the array isn't sorted, and we can only perform up to two swaps.

So, my approach should be to adjust the array in such a way that the binary search, following its peculiar rules, lands on the correct position for x.

First, I need to simulate the binary search to see where it would end up without any swaps. Then, based on that, decide which swaps to make.

Let me consider the example provided:

Input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

Output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

In the first test case, the array is already sorted, and x=3 is at position 3. The binary search would find it without any swaps, so the output is 0.

In the second test case, the array is [3,1,6,5,2,4], and x=5 is at position 4. By swapping positions 3 and 4 (elements 6 and 5), the array becomes [3,1,5,6,2,4]. Now, the binary search should find x=5.

Wait, but according to the output, only one swap is needed: 3 4. Let me verify this.

Wait, indices are 1-based, so position 3 has 6 and position 4 has 5. Swapping them makes the array [3,1,5,6,2,4]. Now, let's see how the binary search proceeds.

Initialize l=1, r=7.

First loop:

m = floor((1+7)/2) = 4

p_m = p[4] = 6, which is > x=5, so r = 4

Now, l=1, r=4

Second loop:

m = floor((1+4)/2) = 2

p_m = p[2] =1, which is < x=5, so l=2

Now, l=2, r=4

Third loop:

m = floor((2+4)/2) = 3

p_m = p[3] =5, which is <= x=5, so l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

Fourth loop:

m = floor((3+4)/2) = 3

p_m = p[3]=5 <=x=5, so l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

Fifth loop:

m = floor((3+4)/2)=3

p_m=5<=5, l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

Sixth loop:

m=floor((3+4)/2)=3

p_m=5<=5, l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

Seventh loop:

m=floor((3+4)/2)=3

p_m=5<=5, l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

...

It seems like it's stuck in an infinite loop. Wait, but according to the problem, it should stop when r - l =1. But here, r - l =1 when l=3 and r=4.

So, it should stop with l=3, and p_l =5, which is x=5. Wait, but x=5 is at position 4 originally, but after swapping positions 3 and 4, x=5 is at position 3, and p_l should be x.

Wait, but in the original array, x=5 is at position 4. After swapping positions 3 and 4, the array becomes [3,1,5,6,2,4], and x=5 is now at position 3. The binary search ends with l=3, which is where x=5 is now located.

So, it works with one swap.

In the third test case:

n=5, x=1

p=[3,5,4,2,1]

Swap twice to make p_l =1 after binary search.

Output:

2

2 4

1 5

So, first swap positions 2 and 4: [3,2,4,5,1]

Then swap positions 1 and 5: [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, the array is [1,2,4,5,3]

Let's see how the binary search proceeds.

Initialize l=1, r=6

First loop:

m=floor((1+6)/2)=3

p_m=p[3]=4 >=x=1, so l=3

Now, l=3, r=6

Second loop:

m=floor((3+6)/2)=4

p_m=p[4]=5 >=x=1, so l=4

Now, l=4, r=6

Third loop:

m=floor((4+6)/2)=5

p_m=p[5]=3 >=x=1, so l=5

Now, l=5, r=6

Fourth loop:

m=floor((5+6)/2)=5

p_m=p[5]=3 >=x=1, so l=5

Now, l=5, r=6

Stop since r - l =1

p_l =p[5]=3, which is not x=1.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's supposed to work.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the swaps.

First swap: positions 2 and 4: [3,5,4,2,1] -> [3,2,4,5,1]

Second swap: positions 1 and 5: [3,2,4,5,1] -> [1,2,4,5,3]

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2 4 and 1 5.

Wait, positions are 1-based.

So, first swap: positions 2 and 4: 5 and 2 are swapped: [3,2,4,5,1]

Second swap: positions 1 and 5: 3 and 1 are swapped: [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_m=4 >=1, l=3

m=4, p_m=5 >=1, l=4

m=5, p_m=3 >=1, l=5

m=5, p_m=3 >=1, l=5

Stop with l=5, p_l=3, which is not x=1.

Wait, but according to the sample, it should work.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the positions.

Wait, in the sample output, it's 2 swaps: 2 4 and 1 5.

Let's see:

Original array: [3,5,4,2,1]

Swap 2 and 4: positions 2 (5) and 4 (2): [3,2,4,5,1]

Swap 1 and 5: positions 1 (3) and 5 (1): [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_m=4 >=1, l=3

m=4, p_m=5 >=1, l=4

m=5, p_m=3 >=1, l=5

m=5, p_m=3 >=1, l=5

Stop with l=5, p_l=3, which is not x=1.

But according to the sample, it's correct.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the condition.

Looking back at the problem, the condition is:

If p_m <= x, assign l = m, otherwise r = m.

Wait, in the sample, x=1.

So, p_m <=1.

In the first step:

m=3, p_m=4 >1, so r=3

Now, l=1, r=3

m=2, p_m=2 >1, r=2

Now, l=1, r=2

m=1, p_m=1 <=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=2

m=1, p_m=1 <=1, l=1

Stop with l=1, p_l=1, which is x=1.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, I had l=5.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the binary search steps.

Let's try again.

Initialize l=1, r=6

First loop:

m=floor((1+6)/2)=3

p_m=p[3]=4

4 >1, so r=3

Now, l=1, r=3

Second loop:

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_m=p[1]=1

1 <=1, so l=1

Now, l=1, r=3

Third loop:

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_m=1 <=1, l=1

Stop with l=1, p_l=1, which is x=1.

Okay, so it works with two swaps: 2 4 and 1 5.

Got it.

So, the strategy seems to be:

- Perform up to two swaps to arrange the array in such a way that the binary search, with its specific rules, ends up with p_l equal to x.

Now, I need to find a general way to determine which swaps to make.

First, let's understand what the binary search is doing.

The binary search starts with l=1 and r=n+1.

It repeatedly calculates m = floor((l + r)/2), checks p_m against x, and adjusts l or r accordingly.

The loop stops when r - l =1, and the final l is the result.

Given that the array is a permutation, all elements are distinct.

I need to ensure that after at most two swaps, the binary search ends with p_l =x.

It's guaranteed that two swaps are always sufficient.

I need to find a way to achieve this.

One approach could be:

1. Simulate the binary search on the original array to see where it ends up.

2. If p_l == x, then no swaps are needed.

3. If p_l != x, then try to adjust the array with swaps to make p_l =x.

But it's not straightforward because the binary search path depends on the array's values.

Another idea is to consider the positions of x and the element that would be at l after the binary search.

I need to make sure that after swaps, the element at position l is x.

But I need to determine which position l the binary search will end up with, and ensure that p_l =x.

This seems circular because l depends on the array's arrangement.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x anywhere I want in the array, and adjust one other element.

But I need to ensure that the binary search's l ends up at the position where x is placed.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can ensure that x is placed in a position that the binary search would naturally converge to.

But given that the binary search is applied to an unsorted array, it's not clear where it would converge.

An alternative approach is to consider that with two swaps, I can make the array somewhat sorted in a way that the binary search reaches x.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think about the properties of the binary search in this context.

The binary search divides the range [l, r) into halves and moves the search interval based on whether p_m <= x or not.

Given that, perhaps I can partition the array into two parts: one where p_i <= x and one where p_i > x.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the final position l that the binary search ends up with, and ensure that p_l =x.

To do that, I need to make sure that the binary search reaches the position where x is placed.

But again, it's circular.

Wait, maybe I can simulate the binary search process and see what conditions need to be met for it to end at a particular position.

Let's consider the binary search steps in more detail.

Initialize l=1, r=n+1

Loop while r - l !=1:

m = floor((l + r)/2)

if p_m <=x:

l = m

else:

r = m

At the end, p_l should be x.

I need to make sure that after swaps, p_l =x.

But l is determined by the search process, which depends on the array's values.

This seems recursive.

Perhaps I can consider that the final l is some value, and work backwards to see what needs to be where.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the sample inputs and outputs to get some ideas.

In the first sample:

n=6, x=3

p=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=4 >3, r=4

l=1, r=4

m=2, p_m=2 <=3, l=2

l=2, r=4

m=3, p_m=3 <=3, l=3

l=3, r=4

m=3, p_m=3 <=3, l=3

Stop with l=3, p_l=3==x.

So, no swaps needed.

In the second sample:

n=6, x=5

p=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

After swapping positions 3 and 4: [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=6 >5, r=4

l=1, r=4

m=2, p_m=1 <=5, l=2

l=2, r=4

m=3, p_m=5 <=5, l=3

l=3, r=4

m=3, p_m=5 <=5, l=3

Stop with l=3, p_l=5==x.

So, one swap suffices.

In the third sample:

n=5, x=1

p=[3,5,4,2,1]

After two swaps: positions 2 and 4 (5 and 2): [3,2,4,5,1]

Then positions 1 and 5 (3 and 1): [1,2,4,5,3]

Binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_m=4 >1, r=3

l=1, r=3

m=1, p_m=1 <=1, l=1

Stop with l=1, p_l=1==x.

So, two swaps suffice.

In the fourth sample:

n=6, x=3

p=[4,3,1,5,2,6]

After two swaps: positions 4 and 5 (5 and 2): [4,3,1,2,5,6]

Then positions 2 and 4 (3 and 2): [4,2,1,3,5,6]

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=7

m=5, p_m=5 >3, r=5

l=4, r=5

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

Stop with l=4, p_l=2 !=3.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's two swaps: 4 5 and 2 4.

Wait, let's see:

Original: [4,3,1,5,2,6]

First swap: positions 4 and 5: 5 and 2 -> [4,3,1,2,5,6]

Second swap: positions 2 and 4: 3 and 2 -> [4,2,1,3,5,6]

Now, binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=7

m=5, p_m=5 >3, r=5

l=4, r=5

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

Stop with l=4, p_l=2 !=3.

But according to the sample output, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the sample output, it's:

2

4 5

2 4

So, first swap positions 4 and 5: [4,3,1,5,2,6] -> [4,3,1,2,5,6]

Second swap positions 2 and 4: [4,3,1,2,5,6] -> [4,2,1,3,5,6]

Now, binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=7

m=5, p_m=5 >3, r=5

l=4, r=5

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

Stop with l=4, p_l=2 !=3.

But according to the sample, it's correct.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the binary search.

Wait, looking back at the problem, the condition is:

If p_m <=x, l = m

Else, r = m

So, in the first step:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=7

m=5, p_m=5 >3, r=5

l=4, r=5

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

Stop with l=4, p_l=2 !=3.

But the sample says it's correct. Maybe I'm misreading the sample.

Wait, perhaps I need to output the number of swaps and the swaps themselves, and the binary search is performed on the modified array.

In this case, after swaps, the array is [4,2,1,3,5,6], and l ends up at 4 with p_l=2, which is not x=3.

But according to the sample, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that p_l =x after the swaps.

But in this case, it's not.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my simulation.

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the binary search steps.

Initialize l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=7

m=5, p_m=5 >3, r=5

l=4, r=5

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

Stop with l=4, p_l=2 !=3.

But according to the sample, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to output p_l =x, and in this case, p_l=2, which is not x=3, but the sample accepts it.

Wait, no, that can't be. Maybe I misread the sample output.

Wait, in the fourth test case:

n=6, x=3

p=[4,3,1,5,2,6]

Sample output:

2

4 5

2 4

Then:

First swap: positions 4 and 5: [4,3,1,2,5,6]

Second swap: positions 2 and 4: [4,2,1,3,5,6]

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=7

m=5, p_m=5 >3, r=5

l=4, r=5

m=4, p_m=2 <=3, l=4

Stop with l=4, p_l=2 !=3.

But according to the sample, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the binary search termination.

The problem says: "after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x"

But in this case, p_l=2 !=3.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the sample or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the binary search should end with p_l=3.

But in my simulation, it ends with p_l=2.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust my swaps differently.

Let me try different swaps.

Original: [4,3,1,5,2,6]

Swap positions 2 and 3: 3 and 1 -> [4,1,3,5,2,6]

Swap positions 1 and 4: 4 and 5 -> [5,1,3,4,2,6]

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=4 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=7

m=5, p_m=2 <=3, l=5

l=5, r=7

m=5, p_m=2 <=3, l=5

Stop with l=5, p_l=2 !=3.

Still not correct.

Wait, maybe swap positions 1 and 2: [3,4,1,5,2,6]

Then swap positions 3 and 4: [3,4,5,1,2,6]

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=1 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=7

m=5, p_m=2 <=3, l=5

l=5, r=7

m=5, p_m=2 <=3, l=5

Stop with l=5, p_l=2 !=3.

Still not correct.

Wait, maybe swap positions 3 and 5: [4,3,2,5,1,6]

Then swap positions 4 and 5: [4,3,2,1,5,6]

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=1 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=7

m=5, p_m=5 >3, r=5

l=4, r=5

m=4, p_m=1 <=3, l=4

Stop with l=4, p_l=1 !=3.

Still not correct.

Wait, maybe swap positions 2 and 5: [4,2,1,5,3,6]

Then swap positions 4 and 5: [4,2,1,3,5,6]

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_m=3 <=3, l=4

l=4, r=7

m=5, p_m=5 >3, r=5

l=4, r=5

m=4, p_m=3 <=3, l=4

Stop with l=4, p_l=3 ==x.

Yes, in this case, p_l=3==x.

So, swaps: 2 and 5, then 4 and 5.

Which correspond to positions 2 and 5, then 4 and 5.

In 1-based indexing, positions 2 and 5, then 4 and 5.

In the sample output, it's:

2

4 5

2 4

Which is a different sequence of swaps but achieves the same result: p_l=3==x.

So, it works.

Therefore, with the right swaps, it's possible to make p_l =x.

Now, I need a general strategy.

One possible strategy is:

- Simulate the binary search to find the final l.

- If p_l ==x, done.

- Else, find the current position of x, and the position where l ends up.

- Swap x to position l.

- If only one swap is needed, do that.

- If not, perform an additional swap to correct any disruption caused by the first swap.

But this needs to be refined.

Another idea is to track the path of the binary search and ensure that the comparisons lead to the correct l.

But that might be too involved.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should look for a simpler approach.

Looking back at the problem, it's stated that two swaps are always sufficient.

So, there must be a way to achieve the goal with at most two swaps.

One possible way is:

- Find the position where the binary search ends up (l).

- If p_l ==x, no swaps needed.

- Else, find the current position of x (pos_x).

- Swap p_l and p_{pos_x}.

- If p_l ==x after this swap, done with one swap.

- Else, find another element to swap to correct any issues.

But this seems too simplistic.

Wait, in the earlier example, swapping x to position l might not be enough because the binary search path could be affected by other elements.

Therefore, a better approach might be:

- Simulate the binary search to find the final l.

- If p_l ==x, done.

- Else, swap x to position l.

- If after the swap, p_l ==x, done with one swap.

- Else, perform a second swap to adjust any elements that might be causing issues.

To implement this, I need to:

1. Simulate the binary search to find l.

2. Check if p_l ==x.

- If yes, output 0.

- Else, find the current position of x.

- Swap p_l and p_{pos_x}.

- Simulate the binary search again to see if p_l ==x.

- If yes, output 1 swap.

- Else, perform a second swap to fix any remaining issues.

But this could be inefficient, and I need to ensure it works within two swaps.

An alternative approach is to consider that with two swaps, I can place x in position l and adjust one other element to maintain the search path.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the following algorithm:

- Perform the binary search to find l.

- If p_l ==x, output 0.

- Else, find the current position of x (pos_x).

- Swap p_l and p_{pos_x}.

- Perform the binary search again.

- If p_l ==x, output 1 swap.

- Else, find another element to swap to fix the issue.

But in practice, this might not always work because swapping p_l and p_{pos_x} could disrupt the binary search path.

Looking back at the sample where two swaps are needed:

n=5, x=1

p=[3,5,4,2,1]

First swap: positions 2 and 4: [3,2,4,5,1]

Second swap: positions 1 and 5: [1,2,4,5,3]

Binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_m=4 >1, r=3

l=1, r=3

m=1, p_m=1 <=1, l=1

Stop with l=1, p_l=1==x.

So, in this case, two swaps were enough.

But what's the logic behind these swaps?

In this case, x=1 was at position 5.

Swapping positions 2 and 4: 5 and 2.

Then swapping positions 1 and 5: 3 and 1.

Resulting in [1,2,4,5,3].

Now, the binary search finds x=1 at position 1.

But I need a general method, not specific to this example.

Perhaps I can consider that with two swaps, I can place x in position l and ensure that the binary search path leads to l.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of x to be l, and adjust the elements in such a way that the binary search converges to l.

But again, it's not clear how to do this in general.

An alternative idea is to consider that with two swaps, I can make the subarray from l to r sorted in a way that the binary search works correctly.

But this seems too broad.

Another approach is to consider that with two swaps, I can place x in position l and ensure that all elements compared during the binary search path satisfy the conditions to lead to l.

But this requires understanding the entire search path, which might be too time-consuming.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should accept that two swaps are always sufficient and focus on implementing an algorithm that performs the swaps in a consistent manner to achieve the desired result.

Here's a possible plan:

1. Simulate the binary search to find l.

2. If p_l ==x, output 0.

3. Else, find the current position of x (pos_x).

4. Swap p_l and p_{pos_x}.

5. Simulate the binary search again to find the new l.

6. If p_l ==x, output 1 swap: l and pos_x.

7. Else, perform a second swap to fix any remaining issues.

For the second swap, I can choose to swap p_l with another element that doesn't disrupt the search path.

But it's not clear which element to choose.

An alternative is to choose an element that is not x and not at position l, and swap it with one that is causing the issue.

But this is too vague.

Looking back at the sample where two swaps are needed, the swaps seem to be choosing elements that are on the binary search path and adjusting them to guide the search to l.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should implement the following algorithm:

- Simulate the binary search to find l.

- If p_l ==x, output 0.

- Else, find pos_x.

- Swap p_l and p_{pos_x}.

- Simulate the binary search again.

- If p_l ==x, output 1 swap: l and pos_x.

- Else, find another element to swap with p_l to fix the issue.

For the second swap, choose an element that, when swapped with p_l, makes p_l ==x.

But this seems similar to the first swap and might not work.

Alternatively, choose an element that is not x and not at position l, and swap it with p_l to make p_l ==x.

But this might require more than two swaps.

Wait, but I only have two swaps.

So, perhaps I need to choose the second swap carefully.

An alternative idea is to swap p_l with an element that would make the binary search converge to l.

But this requires predicting how the swap affects the search path.

This is getting too complicated.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should accept that two swaps are always sufficient and focus on implementing an algorithm that performs the swaps in a consistent manner to achieve the desired result.

Here's a possible plan:

1. Simulate the binary search to find l.

2. If p_l ==x, output 0.

3. Else, find the current position of x (pos_x).

4. Swap p_l and p_{pos_x}.

5. Simulate the binary search again to find the new l.

6. If p_l ==x, output 1 swap: l and pos_x.

7. Else, find another element to swap with p_l to make p_l ==x.

- Choose an element that is not x and not at position l, and swap it with p_l.

- Output 2 swaps: first l and pos_x, second l and some other position.

But I need to ensure that after the second swap, p_l ==x.

This might not always work, but given the problem's guarantee that two swaps are always sufficient, it should be possible.

I need to implement this carefully.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

- It reads the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- Reads n and x.

- Reads the permutation p.

- Creates a dictionary num_indx to store the positions of each number.

- Initializes an array seen of size n with zeros.

- Performs the binary search simulation:

- Initializes left=0 and right=n.

- While right - left >1:

- Calculates mid = left + (right - left)//2

- Marks p[mid] as seen.

- If p[mid] <=x, sets left=mid.

- Else, sets right=mid.

- After the loop, checks if p[left] ==x.

- If yes, outputs 0.

- Else, checks if x was not seen during the search.

- If not seen, performs one swap: swaps p[left] and p[x's position].

- Outputs 1 swap: left+1 and num_indx[x].

- Else, performs two swaps:

- Finds the smallest unseen number's position.

- Swaps p[left] with that position.

- Then swaps that position with x's position.

- Outputs 2 swaps accordingly.

This seems to align with the strategy I was considering.

Let me verify if this logic is correct.

First, it simulates the binary search to find l (left).

If p_l ==x, it's done.

Else, it checks if x was seen during the search.

- If not seen, it means x was not encountered during the search path, so swapping p_l with x should make p_l ==x.

- Then, performing the binary search again should find x at l.

- Outputs 1 swap.

- If x was seen during the search, it means x was encountered but the search didn't end with p_l ==x.

- In this case, it needs to perform two swaps:

- First, swap p_l with some other element to make p_l !=x, and then swap x into position l.

- The code chooses to swap p_l with the smallest unseen element, then swap that position with x's position.

- This ensures that p_l is set to x.

- Outputs 2 swaps.

This seems logically sound, given the constraints.

Therefore, the provided program seems to correctly implement the required logic to achieve p_l ==x with at most two swaps.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correct}} \]
