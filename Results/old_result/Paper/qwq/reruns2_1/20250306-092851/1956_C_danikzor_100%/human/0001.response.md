Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n x n matrix that's initially filled with zeros. Nene can perform two types of operations on this matrix. In each operation, she chooses a row or a column and assigns a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to that row or column. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix after performing at most 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. A Type 1 operation allows me to set a entire row to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Similarly, a Type 2 operation lets me set a entire column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Since I can perform up to 2n operations, I need to figure out the best way to use these operations to maximize the sum of the matrix.

Let me think about how the matrix is filled. Each cell in the matrix can be set multiple times if I choose to operate on both its row and its column. I need to consider how these operations interact with each other.

Suppose I perform a Type 1 operation on a row, setting it to a certain permutation. Then, if I perform a Type 2 operation on a column, it will set the entire column to another permutation. The cell where this row and column intersect will be set twice: first by the row operation and then by the column operation.

So, the final value of a cell will be the value set by the last operation that affects it. That means, if I do a row operation and then a column operation, the cell will have the value from the column operation.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully. When I set a row, I'm setting all the cells in that row to specific values. Then, when I set a column, I'm setting all the cells in that column to other values. The cell at the intersection will be set twice, so the last operation will determine its value.

So, if I do a row operation first and then a column operation, the column operation will overwrite the row operation for the intersecting cell.

Hmm, maybe I should try to arrange operations so that I minimize overwriting, or perhaps accept it and find a pattern.

Let me consider a small n, like n=1. In this case, the matrix has only one cell. I can perform either a Type 1 or a Type 2 operation, both of which set the single cell to 1. So, the maximum sum is 1, and I can do it in one operation.

For n=2, let's see. If I perform two Type 1 operations, setting both rows to [2,1], then the matrix would be:

2 1

2 1

Sum is 6.

Alternatively, if I perform two Type 2 operations, setting both columns to [2,1], then the matrix would be:

2 2

1 1

Sum is 6.

If I perform one Type 1 and one Type 2, for example, set row 1 to [2,1] and then set column 1 to [2,1], the matrix would be:

2 (from row 1) then overwritten by 2 (from column 1), so 2

1 (from row 1), not overwritten, so 1

2 (from column 1), so 2

1 (from row 1), not overwritten, so 1

Total sum is 6 again.

Wait, but according to the example in the problem, they achieved a sum of 7 with n=2. So, I must be missing something.

Let me look back at the example:

In the second test case, n=2, and they achieved a sum of 7 with 3 operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with permutation [2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with permutation [2,1]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with permutation [2,1]

Let's see what the matrix looks like after these operations.

Initially:

0 0

0 0

After Type 1 on row 1 with [2,1]:

2 1

0 0

Then Type 1 on row 2 with [2,1]:

2 1

2 1

Then Type 2 on column 1 with [2,1]:

2 (from column 1) overwrites previous 2

2 (from column 1) overwrites previous 0

So matrix becomes:

2 (from column 1) -> 2

1 (from row 1) -> 1

2 (from column 1) -> 2

1 (from row 2) -> 1

Wait, no. Wait, when you set column 1 to [2,1], it sets the first column to 2 and 1, so:

2  ?

1  ?

But the second column was previously set to [1,1] from the row operations.

Wait, no. When you set a column, you're setting all its elements to the permutation. So, setting column 1 to [2,1] means:

2  ?

1  ?

And the row operations set the rows to [2,1] and [2,1], but the column operation overwrites the first element of each row.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently. Each operation allows me to set an entire row or an entire column to a permutation of [1,2,...,n]. I need to maximize the sum of the matrix.

I need to find a way to assign values to the matrix such that the sum is maximized, using at most 2n operations.

Let me consider that each cell can be set by at most one row operation and one column operation. The last operation on the cell determines its value.

I need to maximize the sum, so I should aim to set as many cells as possible to the highest possible values.

One approach could be to set all rows to the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then set all columns to the same permutation. However, this might not be optimal because the column operations will overwrite the row operations for the cells in those columns.

Wait, maybe I should set half the rows and half the columns, but I need to ensure that the operations don't cancel each other's effects too much.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set all rows first, and then set selected columns to override certain cells to higher values.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the maximum possible sum.

What's the maximum possible sum I can achieve?

Each cell can be set to any value from 1 to n, but with the operations being permutations, so I can't set individual cells independently.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a linear algebra problem or think about it in terms of covering the matrix with rows and columns.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the sum contributed by row operations and column operations.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion might help here.

Let me consider that each row operation sets a row to a permutation, contributing the sum of that permutation to the total sum, unless overridden by a column operation.

Similarly, each column operation sets a column to a permutation, contributing the sum of that permutation to the total sum, unless overridden by a later column operation.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern or formula.

Looking back at the example, for n=1, sum=1, for n=2, sum=7.

Let me compute what the program outputs for n=2.

The program prints n*(n+1)*(4*n - 1)//6, which for n=2 is 2*3*7//6 = 42//6=7, which matches the example.

So, the program claims that the maximum sum is n*(n+1)*(4*n - 1)//6, and it uses 2n operations.

Let me verify this formula for n=1: 1*2*3//6=6//6=1, which matches the example.

For n=2: 2*3*7//6=14, but in the example, it's 7. Wait, the program prints 7 for n=2, and in the explanation, it's 7. So, perhaps the formula is correct.

Wait, hold on. For n=2, according to the formula: 2*3*7//6=42//6=7, which matches the example.

For n=3: 3*4*11//6=132//6=22.

Let me see if that makes sense.

If I set all rows to [3,2,1], that would give me a sum of 3+2+1=6 per row, total 18 for 3 rows.

Then, if I set all columns to [3,2,1], that would give me another 3+2+1=6 per column, but since the columns overwrite the rows for their cells, it's not just adding another 6.

Wait, no. When I set a column, it overwrites the cells in that column.

So, if I set all rows to [3,2,1], sum is 18.

Then, setting column 1 to [3,2,1], overwrites the first column, so now the matrix is:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum is 3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1 = 3+2+1=6, 2+2+1=5, 1+2+1=4, total 15.

Wait, that's less than 18. So, perhaps setting columns decreases the sum in this case.

Wait, that's counterintuitive. Maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the order of operations matters.

Let me first set all rows to [3,2,1], sum=18.

Then set column 1 to [3,2,1], overwriting the first column, so now:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum is 3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1 = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.

Then set column 2 to [3,2,1], overwriting the second column:

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum is 3+3+1=7, 2+2+1=5, 1+2+1=4, total 16.

Then set column 3 to [3,2,1], overwriting the third column:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 2 1

Sum is 3+3+3=9, 2+2+2=6, 1+2+1=4, total 19.

So, total sum is 19.

But according to the formula, for n=3, it's 3*4*11//6=132//6=22.

So, my manual calculation gives 19, but the formula says 22.

So, perhaps my approach is not optimal.

Let me see what the program does for n=3.

It prints n*(n+1)*(4*n -1)//6, which is 22, and then performs 6 operations: setting all rows and all columns to [3,2,1].

Let me simulate that.

Start with all zeros.

Perform Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Then Type 1 on row 2 with [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

0 0 0

Then Type 1 on row 3 with [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Then Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1], overwriting column 1:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Then Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1], overwriting column 2:

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Then Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1], overwriting column 3:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 2 1

Sum is 3+3+3=9, 2+2+2=6, 1+2+1=4, total 19.

Wait, but the formula says 22.

So, perhaps this approach isn't achieving the maximum sum.

Is there a better way to arrange the operations?

Maybe I should set rows first and then select some columns to overwrite certain cells to higher values.

Alternatively, perhaps setting columns first and then rows.

Let me try setting all columns first, then all rows.

Start with all zeros.

Type 2 on column 1 with [3,2,1]:

3 0 0

2 0 0

1 0 0

Type 2 on column 2 with [3,2,1]:

3 3 0

2 2 0

1 2 0

Type 2 on column 3 with [3,2,1]:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 2 1

Then, Type 1 on row 1 with [3,2,1], overwriting row 1:

3 2 1

2 2 2

1 2 1

Sum is 3+2+1=6, 2+2+2=6, 1+2+1=4, total 16.

Worse than before.

Alternatively, set some rows and some columns in a different order.

Maybe set half the rows and half the columns.

Wait, n=3, 2n=6 operations, but perhaps I don't need all 6.

But the problem allows up to 2n operations, I don't need to minimize m, just have m <= 2n.

But I need to achieve the sum claimed by the formula.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the sum.

Let me calculate the formula for n=3: 3*4*11//6=132//6=22.

But in my earlier simulation, I only got 19.

So, perhaps there's a better way to arrange the operations to get a higher sum.

Let me think differently.

Each operation sets an entire row or column to a permutation.

Each cell is thus set by at most one row operation and one column operation.

The value of a cell is determined by the last operation that sets its row or column.

I need to maximize the sum of all cells.

Perhaps I can think of it as covering the matrix with rows and columns, and assigning the highest possible values to the cells.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the sum contributed by row operations and column operations.

If I set a row to a permutation, it contributes the sum of that permutation to the cells unless those cells are later overwritten by a column operation.

Similarly, setting a column contributes to the cells unless they are overwritten by a row operation.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that gives the maximum sum.

Looking back at the example for n=2, sum=7, which matches the formula 2*3*7//6=14//2=7.

For n=1, sum=1, which matches 1*2*3//6=6//6=1.

For n=3, formula says 22, but I can only get 19 with the approach in the program.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but the example for n=2 matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Wait, in the program, it prints n*(n+1)*(4*n -1)//6.

Let me verify this formula.

For n=1: 1*2*3//6=1, correct.

n=2: 2*3*7//6=42//6=7, correct.

n=3: 3*4*11//6=132//6=22.

But in my manual calculation, I only got 19.

So, perhaps there's a better way to arrange the operations to achieve sum=22.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set all rows to [n,n-1,...,1], and then set all columns to [n,n-1,...,1].

Then, the cells that are set by both a row operation and a column operation will have the value from the column operation, since it's the last operation.

So, the sum would be the sum of the column operations plus the sum of the row operations minus the sum of the overlaps, because the overlaps are double-counted.

Wait, no. Actually, in matrix terms, the sum should just be the sum of all the final values in the cells.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion isn't the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each cell is set by at most one operation, either a row or a column operation, whichever comes last.

Wait, but in reality, a cell can be set by both a row and a column operation, and the last one overrides the previous one.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to set as many cells as possible to the highest values, prioritizing higher values in cells that are set by column operations over row operations, since column operations can overwrite row operations.

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider that each operation, whether row or column, sets a complete row or column to a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

The sum contributed by each operation is the sum of the permutation, which is n*(n+1)/2.

So, for 2n operations, the total sum could be up to 2n * n*(n+1)/2 = n^2*(n+1).

But this is an upper bound, and likely not achievable because operations overlap.

In reality, the sum will be less due to overwriting.

So, perhaps the formula n*(n+1)*(4*n -1)//6 is the actual maximum achievable sum.

Given that for n=1 and n=2, it matches, and presumably for other n as well.

But in my manual calculation for n=3, I only got 19, while the formula says 22.

So, maybe there's a better way to arrange the operations to achieve 22.

Let me try a different arrangement for n=3.

Start by setting row 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Then set column 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

2 0 0

1 0 0

Then set row 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 0 0

Then set column 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

3 2 1

1 2 0

Then set row 3 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Then set column 3 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum is 3+3+3=9, 3+2+2=7, 3+2+1=6, total 22.

Ah, there we go. So, with a different ordering of operations, I achieved the sum of 22.

So, the program's approach of setting all rows first and then all columns doesn't achieve the maximum sum, but there exists a sequence of operations that does.

However, the problem doesn't require me to minimize the number of operations, just to use no more than 2n operations and achieve the maximum sum.

So, perhaps there's a way to always achieve the sum n*(n+1)*(4*n -1)//6 with no more than 2n operations.

Given that, I need to verify if the provided program achieves this sum.

In the program, for each test case, it reads n, then prints the sum n*(n+1)*(4*n -1)//6 and m=2n operations.

Then, it performs 2n operations: first n Type 1 operations setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then n Type 2 operations setting each column to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

From my earlier manual calculation for n=3, this approach only achieves a sum of 19, not 22.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

But in the example for n=2, it matches.

Wait, for n=2, n*(n+1)*(4*n -1)//6 = 2*3*7//6=14//2=7, which matches the example.

But for n=1, it's 1*2*3//6=1, which is correct.

For n=3, it's 3*4*11//6=44//2=22, but with the program's operations, I only get 19.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to arrange the operations differently to achieve the sum.

Perhaps if I interleave row and column operations, I can achieve a higher sum.

Let me try for n=3.

Start with all zeros.

Set row 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Set column 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

2 0 0

1 0 0

Set row 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 0 0

Set column 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

3 2 1

1 2 0

Set row 3 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Set column 3 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum is 3+3+3=9, 3+2+2=7, 3+2+1=6, total 22.

This matches the formula.

So, by interleaving row and column operations, I can achieve the desired sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it first sets all rows and then all columns, which doesn't achieve the maximum sum in some cases.

I need to find a way to arrange the operations to achieve the sum n*(n+1)*(4*n -1)//6.

Perhaps if I set rows and columns in an interleaved manner, I can achieve the desired sum.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different formula for the maximum sum.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times each cell is set.

Each cell can be set at most twice, once by a row operation and once by a column operation.

The last operation determines the cell's value.

To maximize the sum, I should aim to set as many cells as possible to the highest values, preferably through column operations since they can set multiple cells at once.

Wait, but in the earlier example, interleaving row and column operations allowed me to achieve the higher sum.

So, perhaps the program needs to interleave row and column operations to achieve the maximum sum.

But the program as given doesn't interleave them; it first sets all rows and then all columns.

So, for n=3, it would set rows 1,2,3 to [3,2,1], then columns 1,2,3 to [3,2,1], resulting in a sum of 19, which is less than 22.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

However, the formula n*(n+1)*(4*n -1)//6 seems to be correct, as evidenced by the n=2 case.

So, perhaps there's a better way to arrange the operations to achieve this sum.

Let me try to generalize the approach for any n.

Suppose I set the first row, then the first column, then the second row, then the second column, and so on.

Let me see for n=3.

Set row 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Set column 1 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

2 0 0

1 0 0

Set row 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 0 0

Set column 2 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

3 2 1

1 2 0

Set row 3 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Set column 3 to [3,2,1]:

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum is 9 + 7 + 6 = 22.

Perfect, matches the formula.

So, by interleaving row and column operations, I can achieve the desired sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it doesn't interleave the operations; it performs all row operations first and then all column operations, which doesn't achieve the maximum sum in all cases.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of elements in an n x n matrix using at most 2n operations, where each operation allows us to set a entire row or column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

## Approach

1. **Understanding Operations**:
   - **Type 1 operation**: Sets a entire row to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - **Type 2 operation**: Sets a entire column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   
2. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - Each cell in the matrix can be set by both a row operation and a column operation, with the last operation determining its value.
   - To maximize the sum, we need a strategy to set higher values in as many cells as possible.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Use a sequence of operations that interleaves row and column operations to maximize coverage and higher value assignments.
   - By setting rows and columns in an interleaved manner, we ensure that higher values are propagated effectively across the matrix.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum achievable sum is given by the formula: \( \text{sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1)}{6} \)

5. **Operation Sequence**:
   - Perform operations in an interleaved manner: set a row, then a column, and repeat.

## Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    # Calculate the maximum sum using the formula
    max_sum = n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6
    # Number of operations is 2n
    operations = 2 * n
    print(max_sum, operations)
    # Define the permutation to be used
    permutation = list(range
