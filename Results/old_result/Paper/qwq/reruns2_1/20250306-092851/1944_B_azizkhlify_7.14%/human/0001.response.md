Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array `a` of length `2n`, and it contains each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice. Then there's an integer `k` (between `1` and `n/2`), and I need to find two arrays `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`, with specific properties.

First, `l` should be a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`, and `r` should be a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`. Moreover, the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

The problem also mentions that at least one pair of `l` and `r` always exists, and if there are multiple solutions, I can output any one of them.

Okay, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what a subset in this context means. It says that a sequence `x` is a subset of `y` if `x` can be obtained by deleting several elements from `y` and rearranging them in any order. So, essentially, `l` is any selection of `2k` elements from the first `n` elements of `a`, and `r` is any selection of `2k` elements from the last `n` elements of `a`.

My goal is to have the XOR of elements in `l` equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

Given that each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in `a`, once in the first half and once in the second half, I need to select elements from these halves to form `l` and `r` respectively.

Let me consider the properties of XOR. XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order in which I XOR the numbers doesn't matter. Also, XOR of a number with itself is zero.

Given that each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in `a`, once in the first half and once in the second half, I can think about the XOR of all elements in the first half and the XOR of all elements in the second half.

Wait, but since each number appears twice, and XOR of a number with itself is zero, the XOR of all elements in the first half would be the XOR of all unique numbers in the first half, but since each number appears exactly twice, the XOR of all elements in the first half would be zero, same for the second half.

Hmm, that seems off. Wait, no. If each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in `a`, but split between the first and second halves, it's possible that some numbers are duplicated in the first half or the second half.

Wait, no, the problem says that `a` contains each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice, but it doesn't specify how they are distributed between the first and second halves. In fact, since `a` is of length `2n`, and it's split into two halves of `n` elements each, each number appears once in each half, because there are `n` unique numbers, each appearing twice.

Wait, but the problem says that each integer from `1` to `n` occurs exactly twice in `a`, but it doesn't specify the distribution between the two halves. It's possible that some numbers appear twice in the first half and not in the second, but no, that can't be, because there are only `n` positions in each half, and `n` unique numbers, so each number must appear exactly once in each half.

Wait, but the problem says that each integer from `1` to `n` occurs exactly twice in `a`, and `a` is of length `2n`. So, if each number appears exactly twice, and there are `2n` positions, and the array is split into two halves of `n` elements each, then each number must appear exactly once in each half.

Yes, that makes sense. Because if a number appears twice in one half, then in the other half, it would have to appear zero times, but that would mean that some other numbers appear more than once in the other half, which contradicts the condition that each number appears exactly twice in the entire array.

Therefore, each number appears exactly once in the first half and once in the second half.

Given that, I need to select `2k` elements from the first half (`l`) and `2k` elements from the second half (`r`), such that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

Given that, perhaps I can select the same elements for `l` and `r`, but from their respective halves.

Wait, but since each element appears only once in each half, I can't select the same element from both halves, because they are different instances.

But, since the values are the same, selecting the same values from both halves would mean that `l` and `r` have the same elements, just from different halves.

In that case, the XOR of `l` would be equal to the XOR of `r`, because they contain the same elements.

Wait, but the problem allows me to select any subset of `2k` elements from each half, as long as their XORs are equal.

So, one straightforward way is to select the same `2k` elements from both halves, meaning selecting the same values but from different halves.

But, since each element appears only once in each half, I can select the same values from both halves.

Wait, but in terms of indices, they are different, but in terms of values, they are the same.

So, for example, if `n=2`, `k=1`, and `a = [1,2,2,1]`, then I can select `l = [2,1]` from the first half and `r = [2,1]` from the second half. The XOR of `l` is `2 XOR 1 = 3`, and the XOR of `r` is `2 XOR 1 = 3`, which matches.

That's what's done in the first example.

Similarly, in the second example, `n=6`, `k=1`, and `a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]`, they selected `l = [6,4]` and `r = [1,3]`, and their XORs are both `2`.

Wait, how did they choose that? Is there a specific strategy?

I need to find a general way to select `l` and `r` such that their XORs are equal.

One approach could be to select `k` pairs of elements, where each pair consists of the same value from the first and second halves.

Since each number appears once in each half, I can pair each number's occurrence in the first half with its occurrence in the second half.

Then, selecting the same `k` pairs would ensure that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

But, since I need to select `2k` elements from each half, and each pair consists of two elements (one from each half), this might not directly apply.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of XOR properties.

Let me consider that the XOR of all elements in the first half is equal to the XOR of all elements in the second half, because both are equal to the XOR of all numbers from `1` to `n`, each appearing once.

Wait, but in the first half, each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly once, so the XOR of the first half is equal to the XOR of numbers from `1` to `n`. Similarly, the XOR of the second half is also equal to the XOR of numbers from `1` to `n`.

Therefore, the XOR of the first half equals the XOR of the second half.

Given that, perhaps I can select `l` and `r` such that the XOR of the remaining elements in each half also equals each other.

Wait, maybe I need to select `l` and `r` such that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

I need a systematic way to select `l` and `r`.

Let me consider selecting `k` pairs, where each pair consists of the same value from the first and second halves.

Since each number appears once in each half, I can pair them up based on their value.

Then, selecting `k` such pairs would give me `k` elements from the first half and `k` elements from the second half, with the same values.

Then, I can duplicate each selected element in `l` and `r` to meet the `2k` requirement.

Wait, but I need `2k` elements in each `l` and `r`.

Wait, perhaps I can select `k` pairs and then duplicate each element in `l` and `r`.

Wait, no, that might not work.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I select `k` unique numbers from `1` to `n`, and for each selected number, I pick both its occurrences in the first half for `l`, and both its occurrences in the second half for `r`.

Wait, but each number appears only once in each half, so I can't pick both occurrences from the same half.

I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each number appears exactly once in each half.

So, for each number, there is one instance in the first half and one in the second half.

If I select a number, I can pick its instance from the first half for `l`, and its instance from the second half for `r`.

But then, for `k` numbers, I would have `k` elements in `l` and `k` elements in `r`.

But I need `2k` elements in each.

So, perhaps I need to select `2k` numbers, and for each selected number, pick its instance from the first half for `l`, and its instance from the second half for `r`.

But that would give me `2k` elements in `l` and `2k` elements in `r`, but I need to ensure that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

Given that each selected number's instance is picked once from each half, and since the values are the same, the XOR of `l` would be equal to the XOR of `r`.

Wait, is that necessarily true?

Let me take an example.

Suppose `n=2`, `k=1`, `a=[1,2,2,1]`.

If I select number `1` and number `2`, then `l=[1,2]` and `r=[1,2]`, and XOR of `l` is `1 XOR 2 = 3`, and XOR of `r` is `1 XOR 2 = 3`, which matches.

Similarly, in the second example, `n=6`, `k=1`, `a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]`.

If I select numbers `6` and `4`, then `l=[6,4]` and `r=[6,4]`, but in the example, they selected `l=[6,4]` and `r=[1,3]`, which also have the same XOR (`6 XOR 4 = 2` and `1 XOR 3 = 2`).

So, their XOR matches, but they selected different numbers in `l` and `r`.

Wait, so perhaps there are multiple ways to select `l` and `r` such that their XORs are equal.

In that case, one approach is to select `k` pairs of numbers, where the XOR of the numbers in the `l` pair equals the XOR of the numbers in the `r` pair.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can select any `2k` elements from the first half for `l`, and then select `2k` elements from the second half for `r` such that the XOR of `r` equals the XOR of `l`.

But how do I efficiently find such a selection?

This seems like it could involve some kind of system of equations with bitwise XOR.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the property that XOR is linear, and treat it as a system of linear equations over GF(2).

But that might be too slow for the constraints, since `n` can be up to `5e4` and the sum of `n` over all test cases is up to `5e4`.

I need an efficient solution.

Let me think differently.

Since each number appears exactly once in the first half and once in the second half, I can think of the first half as a set of numbers, and the second half as another set containing the same numbers.

Then, I need to select `2k` numbers from the first half and `2k` numbers from the second half such that the XOR of the selected numbers in the first half equals the XOR of the selected numbers in the second half.

Given that, perhaps I can select any `2k` numbers from the first half, compute their XOR, and then try to select `2k` numbers from the second half that have the same XOR.

But selecting `2k` numbers with a specific XOR from a set of `n` numbers is not straightforward, especially under time constraints.

Is there a smarter way to do this?

Wait, since the two halves contain the same numbers, just arranged differently, perhaps there is a way to pair them up.

Wait, another idea: since each number appears exactly once in each half, I can think of the first half and second half as two permutations of the numbers from `1` to `n`.

Then, I need to select `2k` numbers from the first permutation and `2k` numbers from the second permutation, such that the XOR of the selected numbers in the first permutation equals the XOR of the selected numbers in the second permutation.

This still seems tricky.

Let me consider small values of `k`.

For `k=1`, I need to select `2` elements from the first half and `2` elements from the second half, such that their XORs are equal.

One way to do this is to select two identical elements from each half, but since each number appears only once in each half, I can't select the same number twice in the same half.

Wait, but the problem allows selecting any subset of `2k` elements, so duplicates are allowed in the subset, as long as they come from the original array.

Wait, no, the problem says "subset" in the sense that elements can be deleted and rearranged, but it doesn't specify whether duplicates are allowed in the subset.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"subset: A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the elements in any order."

Given that, and considering the example, where `l` and `r` can contain duplicates if the original array contains them.

But in this problem, each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, once in each half, so in each half, each number appears exactly once.

Therefore, in `l` and `r`, duplicates are not possible, because each number appears only once in each half.

Wait, but in the first example, `l=[2,1]` and `r=[2,1]`, which seem to have duplicates across `l` and `r`, but within each of `l` and `r`, there are no duplicates, because each number appears only once in each half.

Wait, no, in the first example, `a=[1,2,2,1]`, so the first half is `[1,2]` and the second half is `[2,1]`. Then `l=[2,1]` and `r=[2,1]`, which are both permutations of the respective halves.

So, within `l` and within `r`, there are no duplicates, because each number appears only once in each half.

Wait, but in the output, `l` and `r` can contain the same numbers, but they are coming from different halves.

But in terms of values, they can be the same.

So, in this case, since each number appears once in each half, `l` and `r` cannot contain duplicates.

Wait, but the problem allows duplicates in the subset if they exist in the original array.

But in this setup, since each number appears exactly once in each half, `l` and `r` cannot contain duplicates.

Wait, but in the first example, `l=[2,1]` and `r=[2,1]`, which are both containing each number once, as they should.

So, in general, for `k=1`, I need to select `2` numbers from the first half and `2` numbers from the second half, such that their XORs are equal.

Given that each half is a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`, one way is to select the same two numbers from each half, in any order.

For example, select `[2,1]` from the first half and `[2,1]` from the second half, and their XORs will be equal.

Similarly, in the second example, they selected `[6,4]` from the first half and `[1,3]` from the second half, and their XORs are both `2`.

So, there can be multiple ways to select `l` and `r` such that their XORs are equal.

But how to generalize this?

One approach is to fix `l` and then find a subset `r` in the second half with the same XOR.

But finding a subset with a specific XOR is a classic problem that can be solved using XOR properties and Gaussian elimination.

Given the time constraints, I need an efficient way to do this.

Given that `n` can be up to `5e4` and the total sum of `n` over all test cases is up to `5e4`, I need an approach that is linear or nearly linear in `n`.

Let me consider representing the problem in terms of linear algebra over GF(2).

I can represent the selection of elements in `l` and `r` as vectors, and their XORs as the dot product with the vector of elements.

But this seems too abstract.

Let me look for a simpler approach.

An idea: since I need the XOR of `l` to equal the XOR of `r`, that implies that the XOR of `l` and `r` together is zero.

Wait, no, that would be the XOR of all elements in `l` and `r` being zero, but I need the XOR of `l` to equal the XOR of `r`.

Wait, let's denote XOR(l) as the XOR of elements in `l`, and XOR(r) as the XOR of elements in `r`.

I need XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Which is equivalent to XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0, meaning XOR(l + r) = 0.

So, if I consider the combined set of `l` and `r`, their XOR should be zero.

But in this problem, `l` and `r` are selected from different halves, and their sizes are both `2k`.

Given that, perhaps I can select `l` arbitrarily and then adjust `r` to make sure that XOR(r) = XOR(l).

But how?

Wait, since I can select any `2k` elements from the second half for `r`, as long as their XOR equals a specific value, which is XOR(l).

So, the problem reduces to selecting `2k` elements from the second half such that their XOR equals a specific value.

This is a standard problem that can be solved using Gaussian elimination on the XOR values.

But for multiple test cases and with `n` up to `5e4`, this might be too slow if not optimized properly.

I need to find a way to handle this efficiently.

An alternative approach: since I need to select `2k` elements from each half, and their XORs to be equal, perhaps I can select `k` pairs of elements, where each pair consists of the same number from the first and second halves.

Wait, but each number appears only once in each half.

Wait, perhaps selecting `k` numbers and taking both their occurrences from the first and second halves.

But again, each number appears only once in each half.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the XOR of the selected elements.

Let me consider that the XOR of all elements in the first half is equal to the XOR of all elements in the second half, because both are equal to the XOR of numbers from `1` to `n`.

Wait, is that true?

Actually, since each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly once in each half, the XOR of the first half is equal to the XOR of numbers from `1` to `n`, and similarly for the second half.

Therefore, the XOR of the first half equals the XOR of the second half.

Given that, perhaps I can use this property to find `l` and `r`.

Let me denote XOR(first half) = XOR(second half) = S.

Now, if I select a subset `l` from the first half with XOR(l), then the XOR of the remaining elements in the first half would be S XOR XOR(l).

Similarly, if I select a subset `r` from the second half with XOR(r), the XOR of the remaining elements in the second half would be S XOR XOR(r).

But I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Wait, but I need XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, and knowing that XOR(first half) = XOR(second half) = S, perhaps I can relate XOR(l) and XOR(r) to S.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I select `l` to be any `2k` elements from the first half, and then try to select `r` from the second half such that XOR(r) = XOR(l).

Given that, and considering that the second half is a permutation of the first half, perhaps there is a way to efficiently find such an `r`.

But I need an efficient way to do this for multiple test cases.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can precompute the XOR of all possible subsets of size `2k` from the second half, but that's not practical due to the size of `n` and `k`.

Alternatively, perhaps I can fix some elements in `l` and `r` to make their XORs equal.

Wait, perhaps I can select `k` pairs of elements, where each pair consists of the same number from the first and second halves, and then select additional elements to make up the required `2k` elements.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look back at the examples to see if there's a pattern.

In the first example:

n=2, k=1

a=[1,2,2,1]

l=[2,1], r=[2,1]

XOR(l) = 2 XOR 1 = 3

XOR(r) = 2 XOR 1 = 3

In the second example:

n=6, k=1

a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

l=[6,4], r=[1,3]

XOR(l) = 6 XOR 4 = 2

XOR(r) = 1 XOR 3 = 2

In the third example:

n=4, k=1

a=[1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

l=[1,2], r=[1,2]

XOR(l) = 1 XOR 2 = 3

XOR(r) = 1 XOR 2 = 3

In the fourth example:

n=6, k=2

a=[5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

l=[5,1,3,3], r=[6,4,2,4]

XOR(l) = 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 5 XOR 1 XOR 0 = 4 XOR 1 = 5

XOR(r) = 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 6 XOR 0 XOR 2 = 6 XOR 2 = 4

Wait, in the fourth example, XOR(l) = 5 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 5 XOR 1 XOR 0 = 5 XOR 1 = 4

XOR(r) = 6 XOR 4 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 6 XOR 0 XOR 2 = 6 XOR 2 = 4

So, XOR(l) = XOR(r) = 4

Okay, so in this case, they selected `l=[5,1,3,3]` and `r=[6,4,2,4]`, and their XORs are both 4.

So, there are multiple ways to select `l` and `r` such that their XORs are equal.

I need to find a general method that works for any input satisfying the constraints.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Select `k` pairs of numbers, where each pair consists of the same number from the first and second halves.

2. For each such pair, select both elements for `l` and `r` respectively.

But wait, each number appears only once in each half, so selecting the same number from both halves would mean selecting one instance for `l` and one for `r`.

But I need to select `2k` elements for `l` and `2k` for `r`.

So, if I select `k` pairs, that would give me `k` elements for `l` and `k` elements for `r`, but I need `2k` elements in each.

So, this approach doesn't directly work.

Wait, perhaps I need to select `2k` numbers and for each selected number, pick its instance from the first half for `l` and from the second half for `r`.

But then, `l` and `r` would have the same XOR, since they contain the same values.

Wait, but in the second example, they have different values in `l` and `r`, but the same XOR.

So, perhaps selecting the same numbers is just one way, but not the only way.

I need a more general approach.

Let me consider that I can select any `2k` elements from the first half for `l`, and then try to select `2k` elements from the second half for `r` such that XOR(r) = XOR(l).

Given that, I need an efficient way to find such a subset `r`.

This seems like a standard problem of finding a subset with a target XOR, which can be solved using Gaussian elimination.

But with `n` up to `5e4` and multiple test cases, I need an efficient implementation.

Perhaps I can precompute the XOR of all subsets of the second half and store them in a way that allows quick lookup.

But that's not practical due to the size.

An alternative idea: since I need to select `2k` elements from each half, and their XORs to be equal, perhaps I can iterate through all possible selections of `2k` elements from the first half and find matching `2k` elements in the second half.

But that's too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that selecting `2k` elements from the first half is equivalent to selecting `k` pairs of elements, but again, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can utilize the fact that XOR is associative and commutative, and think about the problem in terms of linear dependencies.

Given that, perhaps I can represent the problem as a system of linear equations over GF(2), where each equation corresponds to a bit in the XOR.

But this seems too involved for the time constraints.

Let me consider a different approach.

Since the problem states that at least one pair of `l` and `r` always exists, I can assume that there is a solution and focus on finding one.

Given that, perhaps I can select `l` to be any `2k` elements from the first half, compute their XOR, and then find `2k` elements in the second half whose XOR equals that value.

To efficiently find such a subset in the second half, I can use the fact that selecting `2k` elements with a specific XOR can be handled using Gaussian elimination on the vectors representing the elements.

But again, with `n` up to `5e4`, I need an optimized implementation.

Perhaps I can precompute the XOR of all subsets of size `2k` in the second half, but that's not feasible due to the size.

Wait, perhaps I can think of selecting `2k` elements from the second half as selecting `k` pairs of elements, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: since I need to select `2k` elements from each half, and their XORs to be equal, perhaps I can select `k` pairs of elements where each pair consists of two identical elements, but that's not possible because each number appears only once in each half.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the properties of XOR and how it behaves with multiple elements.

Let me recall that XOR is associative and commutative, and that XOR of a set of elements is the same as the sum modulo 2 of their binary representations in each bit position.

Given that, perhaps I can consider each bit position separately and ensure that the number of set bits in `l` equals the number of set bits in `r` for each bit position.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think about small cases.

Take n=2, k=1:

a=[1,2,2,1]

Possible selections:

l=[1,2], r=[1,2]: XOR(l)=3, XOR(r)=3

l=[2,1], r=[2,1]: XOR(l)=3, XOR(r)=3

l=[1,2], r=[2,1]: XOR(l)=3, XOR(r)=3

So, in this case, any selection works because the XOR is the same for any permutation.

But in the second example, n=6, k=1:

a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

They selected l=[6,4], r=[1,3]: XOR(l)=2, XOR(r)=2

Alternatively, I could select l=[6,4], r=[6,4]: XOR(l)=2, XOR(r)=2

Or l=[2,1], r=[2,1]: XOR(l)=3, XOR(r)=3

So, multiple options.

In this case, perhaps selecting the same elements from both halves is the simplest way.

Given that, maybe I can always select the same `2k` elements from both halves.

But in the second example, they selected different elements in `l` and `r` that have the same XOR.

So, selecting the same elements is just one option.

But to ensure correctness and simplicity, perhaps selecting the same elements from both halves is a safe approach.

Given that, I can proceed to implement this approach.

So, in code, I can:

- Split the array into two halves: first_half and second_half.

- Select any `2k` elements from the first_half for `l`.

- Select the same `2k` elements from the second_half for `r`.

- Since the values are the same, the XOR of `l` will equal the XOR of `r`.

This seems straightforward and guarantees that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Moreover, since each number appears exactly once in each half, selecting the same elements from both halves is valid.

This approach ensures that the subsets `l` and `r` satisfy the required conditions.

Therefore, I can implement this approach in the code.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be attempting something similar, but it's a bit convoluted.

Let me analyze the provided code to see if it implements this approach correctly.

The provided code is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

l = [0] * n

r = [0] * n

re = ul = ur = 0

res = []

for i in range(n):

l[a[i]-1] +=1

for i in range(n, 2*n):

r[a[i]-1] +=1

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i], end=' ')

ul +=2

if ul == k*2:

break

k = 2*k - ul

if k:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==1:

print(a[i], end=' ')

re +=1

res.append(a[i])

if re ==k:

break

print()

for i in res:

print(i, end=' ')

if ul != ur:

for i in range(n, 2*n):

if r[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i], end=' ')

ur +=2

if ul == ur:

break

print()

Wait, this seems to be trying to select elements that appear twice in one half, but given that each number appears exactly once in each half, l[a[i]-1] should always be 1 in the first loop, and r[a[i]-1] should always be 1 in the second loop.

Wait, no, actually, the code is initializing l and r as arrays of size n, and then counting the occurrences of each number in the first and second halves.

But, since each number appears exactly once in each half, l[a[i]-1] and r[a[i]-1] should both be 1 for all i.

Wait, but in the code, there is a loop that does:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i], end=' ')

ul +=2

if ul == k*2:

break

But, since each number appears only once in each half, l[a[i]-1] should be 1 for all i, so this condition should never be true.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the code.

Let me look at the first example:

n=2, k=1

a=[1,2,2,1]

Then, l=[1,1] because a[0]=1 and a[1]=2, so l[0]=1 (for 1), l[1]=1 (for 2)

Similarly, r=[1,1] for a[2]=2 and a[3]=1

Then, in the loop:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i], end=' ')

ul +=2

if ul == k*2:

break

But l[a[0]-1] = l[0] =1 !=2

l[a[1]-1] = l[1] =1 !=2

So, nothing is printed, and ul remains 0.

Then, k = 2*1 - 0 =2

Then, since k is truthy, it proceeds to the next loop:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==1:

print(a[i], end=' ')

re +=1

res.append(a[i])

if re ==k:

break

So, it prints a[0]=1 and a[1]=2, since l[a[0]-1]=1 and l[a[1]-1]=1, and re=2 which equals k=2.

Then, prints a newline.

Then, prints the res, which is [1,2]

Then, since ul != ur (ul=0, ur=0?), but ul == ur, so it doesn't enter the loop.

Then, prints a newline.

Wait, but in the first example, the output is:

2 1

2 1

But according to this code, it would print:

1 2

1 2

Which is also acceptable, since the order doesn't matter as long as the XORs are equal.

So, in this case, it works.

Let's check the second example:

n=6, k=1

a=[6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

Then, first half: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Wait, but according to the problem, each number appears exactly twice, once in each half.

Wait, but in this array, 2 appears twice in the first half, and 5 appears twice in the second half.

Wait, but the problem states that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice, once in each half.

Wait, no, the problem says that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a, but it doesn't specify how they are distributed between the two halves.

Wait, but in this example, 2 appears twice in the first half, and 5 appears twice in the second half.

So, in this case, l=[6,4,2,1,2,3], which are the first n=6 elements.

r=[1,6,3,5,5,4], the second n=6 elements.

Then, l array counts:

l[5-1]=2 (since 6 appears twice)

l[3-1]=2 (since 4 appears twice)

l[1-1]=1 (since 2 appears once)

l[0-1]=1 (since 1 appears once)

Wait, but 2 appears twice in the first half, so l[1-1]=2

Similarly, r array counts:

r[0-1]=1 (1 appears once)

r[5-1]=1 (6 appears once)

r[2-1]=1 (3 appears once)

r[4-1]=2 (5 appears twice)

r[3-1]=1 (4 appears once)

Then, in the loop:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i], end=' ')

ul +=2

if ul == k*2:

break

So, a[0]=6, l[5]=1 !=2

a[1]=4, l[3]=1 !=2

a[2]=2, l[1]=2 ==2, so print 2 2, ul +=2, ul=2, k*2=2, so break.

Then, k = 2*1 - 2 =0

Since k is 0, it doesn't enter the next loop.

Then, print a newline.

Then, since ul != ur, but ul=2, ur=0, so it enters the loop:

for i in range(n, 2*n):

if r[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i], end=' ')

ur +=2

if ul == ur:

break

So, a[6]=1, r[0]=1 !=2

a[7]=6, r[5]=1 !=2

a[8]=3, r[2]=1 !=2

a[9]=5, r[4]=2 ==2, so print 5 5, ur +=2, ur=2

Now, ul == ur, so break.

Then, print a newline.

So, the output would be:

2 2

5 5

But in the example, it's:

6 4

1 3

Which also works, but the code outputs something different.

So, the code's approach isn't consistent with the example's output, but as long as the XORs match, it's acceptable.

So, in this case, 2 XOR 2 = 0, and 5 XOR 5 = 0, which matches.

Therefore, the code's approach seems to be selecting elements that appear twice in one half and printing them twice for `l` and `r`.

But in the second example, 2 appears twice in the first half, and 5 appears twice in the second half, so it selects 2 and 5.

But in the example, they selected 6 and 4 for `l` and 1 and 3 for `r`, which also works.

So, multiple solutions exist, and the code is selecting one based on elements appearing twice in the halves.

In cases where no element appears twice in one half, the code falls back to selecting elements that appear once.

Given that, I need to verify if this approach always works.

Suppose n=4, k=1

a=[1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]

Then, first half: [1,2,3,4]

second half: [1,2,3,4]

Then, l=[1,1,1,1]

Wait, no, l is counts: l[0]=1, l[1]=1, l[2]=1, l[3]=1

Similarly, r=[1,1,1,1]

Then, in the loop:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==2:

But l[a[i]-1] is always 1, so it doesn't print anything, ul=0

Then, k=2*1 -0=2

Then, it selects k=2 elements from the first half that have l[a[i]-1]==1, which is all of them.

So, it selects a[0]=1 and a[1]=2, prints them.

Then, res=[1,2]

Then, prints res: 1 2

Then, since ul != ur (ul=0, ur=0), it doesn't enter the loop.

Then, prints a newline.

So, output is:

1 2

1 2

Which is acceptable, since 1 XOR 2 = 3, and 1 XOR 2 =3.

Another test case:

n=6, k=2

a=[5,1,3,3,5,1,2,6,4,6,4,2]

first half: [5,1,3,3,5,1]

second half: [2,6,4,6,4,2]

Then, l=[5,1,3,3,5,1]

counts: l[4]=2 (5 appears twice)

l[0]=2 (1 appears twice)

l[2]=2 (3 appears twice)

Similarly, r=[2,6,4,6,4,2]

counts: r[1]=2 (2 appears twice)

r[5]=2 (6 appears twice)

r[3]=2 (4 appears twice)

Then, in the loop:

for i in range(n):

if l[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i], end=' ')

ul +=2

if ul == k*2:

break

So, a[0]=5, l[4]=2 ==2, print 5 5, ul=2

a[1]=1, l[0]=2 ==2, print 1 1, ul=4, which equals k*2=4, break.

Then, k=2*2 -4=0

So, doesn't enter the next loop.

Then, print a newline.

Then, since ul != ur, but ul=4, ur=0, so enters the loop:

for i in range(n,2*n):

if r[a[i]-1] ==2:

print(a[i],a[i], end=' ')

ur +=2

if ul == ur:

break

So, a[6]=2, r[1]=2 ==2, print 2 2, ur=2

a[7]=6, r[5]=2 ==2, print 6 6, ur=4

Now, ul == ur, so break.

Then, print a newline.

So, output is:

5 5 1 1

2 2 6 6

Which is acceptable, since XOR(l) =5 XOR 5 XOR 1 XOR 1 =0, and XOR(r)=2 XOR 2 XOR 6 XOR 6 =0.

So, in this case, it works.

Therefore, the code's approach seems to be:

- Select elements that appear twice in the first half and print them twice for `
