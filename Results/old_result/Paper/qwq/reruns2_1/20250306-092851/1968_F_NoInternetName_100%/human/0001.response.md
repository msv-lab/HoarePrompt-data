Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array of numbers, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting subarray is one that can be divided into at least two parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR is. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is asking whether a subarray from index l to r can be split into at least two consecutive segments where each segment's XOR is equal.

I need to think about how to efficiently check this for multiple queries because n and q can be up to 2*10^5, which is quite large. So, any solution that's not efficient enough will probably time out.

Let me consider the properties of XOR. One important property is that XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order of operations doesn't matter, and XOR-ing a sequence of numbers can be thought of as folding the XOR operation over the sequence.

I recall that prefix XOR can be useful in these kinds of problems. If I precompute the prefix XOR array, where prefix[i] is the XOR of all elements from 0 to i-1, then the XOR of a subarray from l to r is prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[l].

So, for the subarray from l to r, its XOR is prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[l].

Now, I need to check if this subarray can be split into at least two consecutive segments where each segment's XOR is equal.

Let's think about this. Suppose I split the subarray into two parts: from l to m and from m+1 to r. Then, the XOR of the first part is prefix[m+1] XOR prefix[l], and the XOR of the second part is prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[m+1]. I need these two to be equal.

So, prefix[m+1] XOR prefix[l] = prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[m+1].

Simplifying this, we can cancel out prefix[m+1] from both sides, and we get prefix[l] = prefix[r+1].

Wait, that seems too straightforward. If prefix[l] = prefix[r+1], then the XOR of the subarray from l to r is zero, because prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[l] = 0. So, in this case, any split where the XOR of each segment is zero would satisfy the condition.

But the problem allows for the XOR of each segment to be equal to some value, not necessarily zero.

Wait, actually, if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, then it's possible to split it into segments where each segment's XOR is zero. But in general, if the XOR of the entire subarray is not zero, can I still split it into segments with equal XOR?

Let me think differently. Suppose the XOR of the entire subarray is S. Then, if I split it into k segments where each segment's XOR is equal to some value T, then k*T = S in XOR terms. But since XOR is its own inverse, this might not hold in the same way as addition.

Wait, actually, XOR is not directly compatible with this kind of division. Maybe I need to think in terms of the frequency of prefix XOR values.

Let me consider that the XOR of the entire subarray is S = prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[l]. Now, if I can split this subarray into k segments where each segment's XOR is T, then S should be equal to T XOR T XOR ... XOR T (k times). Since XOR is its own inverse, if k is even, S = 0, and if k is odd, S = T.

Wait, that seems promising.

So, if k is even, S should be zero, and if k is odd, S should be equal to T.

But the problem states that k > 1, so k can be either even or odd, greater than 1.

So, if k is even, S should be zero, and if k is odd, S should be equal to T.

But T is the XOR of each segment, and T can be any value, including S itself.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that for k > 1, the subarray can be split into at least two parts with equal XOR.

So, for k=2, we need to find m such that l <= m < m+1 <= r, and prefix[m+1] XOR prefix[l] = prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[m+1].

As before, this simplifies to prefix[l] = prefix[r+1], which implies that S = 0.

So, for k=2, the subarray's total XOR must be zero.

Similarly, for k=3, we need to split into three parts with equal XOR. This would require that the total XOR S is equal to T XOR T XOR T = T (since T XOR T = 0, and 0 XOR T = T).

So, for k=3, S = T.

But T is the XOR of each segment, and we need to have S = T.

Wait, but S is the XOR of the entire subarray, which is also equal to T.

So, for k=3, S = T.

But for k=2, S = 0.

Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray from l to r, and I want to split it into k segments where the XOR of each segment is equal.

Let me denote the split points as l = p0 < p1 < p2 < ... < pk = r+1.

Then, the XOR of segment i is prefix[pi] XOR prefix[pi-1].

I need all these to be equal, say to some value T.

So, prefix[p1] XOR prefix[p0] = T

prefix[p2] XOR prefix[p1] = T

...

prefix[pk] XOR prefix[pk-1] = T

If I sum all these up, I get prefix[pk] XOR prefix[p0] = k*T.

But in XOR terms, k*T is T if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, S = prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[l] = k*T.

Thus, if k is even, S = 0.

If k is odd, S = T.

So, for k even, S must be 0.

For k odd, S can be any value.

But k > 1, so we need to have at least k=2.

Therefore, if S = 0, then we can split into any even number of segments with T=0.

If S != 0, then we need to split into an odd number of segments with T=S.

But wait, we need to have at least k=2, which is even, requiring S=0.

So, only when S=0, we can split into even k >=2 with T=0.

If S !=0, then we cannot split into even k >=2 with S=0, but we can try to split into odd k >=3 with S=T.

But k >=3, which is odd, allows S=T.

But we need to have at least one such k >=2.

So, for S=0, we can split into even k >=2.

For S !=0, we cannot split into even k >=2, but maybe into odd k >=3 with T=S.

But for S !=0, can we actually split into odd k >=3 with T=S?

Let's consider an example.

Take the example from the problem:

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

Query: l=1, r=5

Subarray: [1,1,2,3,0]

Total XOR: 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 1 =0, 0 XOR 2=2, 2 XOR 3=1, 1 XOR 0=1.

Wait, that's not matching the example. In the example, they have x=[1,1,2,3,0], and they split it into [1], [1], [2,3,0], and 1=1=2 XOR 3 XOR 0=1.

So, S = 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = (1 XOR 1)=0, 0 XOR 2=2, 2 XOR 3=1, 1 XOR 0=1. So S=1.

But according to my earlier reasoning, for S !=0, we need to split into odd k >=3 with T=S=1.

In this case, k=3, and indeed, each segment's XOR is 1.

So, how can I check if such a split is possible?

I need a way to check if there exists at least one k >=2 that satisfies the condition.

From the earlier analysis:

- If S=0, then we can split into any even k >=2 with T=0.

- If S !=0, then we need to split into odd k >=3 with T=S.

So, for S=0, it's always possible to split into even k >=2.

For S !=0, it's possible only if there exists at least one way to split into odd k >=3 with T=S.

But how do I check this efficiently for multiple queries?

Let me think about the prefix XOR array.

Let prefix[i] be the XOR of a[0] to a[i-1].

Then, the XOR of subarray l to r is prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

Now, for the subarray to be split into k segments with each segment's XOR equal to T, we need to have:

prefix[p1] XOR prefix[l-1] = T

prefix[p2] XOR prefix[p1] = T

...

prefix[r] XOR prefix[pk-1] = T

Where l-1 < p1 < p2 < ... < pk-1 < r.

This implies that prefix[p1] = prefix[l-1] XOR T

prefix[p2] = prefix[p1] XOR T = prefix[l-1] XOR T XOR T = prefix[l-1]

prefix[p3] = prefix[p2] XOR T = prefix[l-1] XOR T

...

Alternately, prefix[p_i] = prefix[l-1] if i is even, or prefix[l-1] XOR T if i is odd.

Wait, that seems off.

Alternatively, considering that for each segment, the prefix XOR at its end is equal to prefix at its start XOR T.

So, for the first segment, prefix[p1] = prefix[l-1] XOR T

For the second segment, prefix[p2] = prefix[p1] XOR T = prefix[l-1] XOR T XOR T = prefix[l-1]

For the third segment, prefix[p3] = prefix[p2] XOR T = prefix[l-1] XOR T

And so on.

This seems cyclic between prefix[l-1] and prefix[l-1] XOR T.

But I need to find a way to check if there are enough split points to achieve the required k >=2.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

I recall that for a subarray's XOR to be zero, it means that the subarray is "balanced" in some way.

In this problem, for S=0, we can split it into an even number of segments with each segment's XOR being zero.

But I need a general way to check for any S.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute all possible prefix XOR values and their indices, and then for each query, determine if there are enough indices to form the required splits.

Let me think about precomputing the prefix XOR array and storing the indices where each XOR value occurs.

So, I can have a dictionary where each key is a XOR value, and the value is a list of indices where that XOR value occurs.

Then, for a query from l to r, I can compute S = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

If S = 0, then I can split into any even k >=2 with T=0.

Otherwise, S !=0, and I need to split into odd k >=3 with T=S.

But how do I check if such a split is possible?

Let me consider that for S=0, I need to find at least one index m where l-1 < m < r such that prefix[m] XOR prefix[l-1] = 0, and prefix[r] XOR prefix[m] = 0.

Which simplifies to prefix[m] = prefix[l-1], and prefix[r] = prefix[m].

So, prefix[m] = prefix[l-1] = prefix[r].

So, if there is at least one m where l-1 < m < r and prefix[m] = prefix[l-1] = prefix[r], then we can split into at least two segments.

Similarly, for S !=0, I need to find m where prefix[m] XOR prefix[l-1] = S, and prefix[r] XOR prefix[m] = S.

So, prefix[m] = prefix[l-1] XOR S, and prefix[r] = prefix[m] XOR S = prefix[l-1] XOR S XOR S = prefix[l-1].

Wait, but S = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1], so if prefix[r] = prefix[l-1], then S=0, which we've already covered.

This seems confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix l and r.

Compute S = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

If S=0, then I need to check if there's at least one m where l-1 < m < r such that prefix[m] = prefix[l-1].

Because then, the first segment from l to m has XOR zero, and the second segment from m+1 to r has XOR zero.

Similarly, for S !=0, I need to find m where prefix[m] = prefix[l-1] XOR S, which is prefix[l-1] XOR (prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]) = prefix[r].

So, for S !=0, I need to find m where prefix[m] = prefix[r].

But wait, in this case, the XOR of the first segment is T = prefix[m] XOR prefix[l-1] = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1] = S.

And the XOR of the second segment is prefix[r] XOR prefix[m] = prefix[r] XOR prefix[r] = 0.

Wait, that doesn't match because I need both segments to have XOR T=S.

So, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I have S !=0, and I want to split into k=3 segments with each segment's XOR equal to T=S.

So, I need to find m1 and m2 where l-1 < m1 < m2 < r such that:

prefix[m1] XOR prefix[l-1] = S

prefix[m2] XOR prefix[m1] = S

prefix[r] XOR prefix[m2] = S

So, from the first equation: prefix[m1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

From the second equation: prefix[m2] = prefix[m1] XOR S = prefix[l-1] XOR S XOR S = prefix[l-1]

From the third equation: prefix[r] = prefix[m2] XOR S = prefix[l-1] XOR S

But from the third equation, prefix[r] = prefix[l-1] XOR S, which is consistent with S = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

So, for S !=0, I need to find m1 and m2 where:

- l-1 < m1 < m2 < r

- prefix[m1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

- prefix[m2] = prefix[l-1]

So, in other words, I need to find m1 and m2 such that:

- m1 is an index where prefix[m1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

- m2 is an index where prefix[m2] = prefix[l-1]

- l-1 < m1 < m2 < r

This seems feasible.

So, for S !=0, I need to find at least one m1 and one m2 satisfying these conditions.

Similarly, for S=0, I need to find at least one m where l-1 < m < r and prefix[m] = prefix[l-1].

Wait, but in the case of S=0, I can split into any even number of segments with T=0.

So, for S=0, I can choose any m where prefix[m] = prefix[l-1], which is necessary for the first segment's XOR to be zero.

But I need to ensure that there's at least one such m in the range.

Wait, but in the example, when S=0, it's sufficient to have at least one m where l-1 < m < r and prefix[m] = prefix[l-1].

Similarly, for S !=0, I need to have at least one m1 where l-1 < m1 < r and prefix[m1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S, and at least one m2 where m1 < m2 < r and prefix[m2] = prefix[l-1].

So, in total, I need to have at least one m1 and one m2 satisfying these conditions.

But to make sure that m1 < m2, I need to ensure that there exists m1 and m2 with m1 < m2, and the conditions on prefix[m1] and prefix[m2].

Given that, I can precompute the prefix XOR array and store the indices where each XOR value occurs.

Then, for each query, compute S = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

If S=0, check if there exists at least one m where l-1 < m < r and prefix[m] = prefix[l-1].

If S !=0, check if there exists at least one m1 where l-1 < m1 < r and prefix[m1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S, and at least one m2 where m1 < m2 < r and prefix[m2] = prefix[l-1].

But to efficiently find such m1 and m2, I need a way to query for indices of certain values within a range.

This sounds like a job for binary search, if I have the list of indices for each prefix XOR value sorted.

So, I can create a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value, and the value is a sorted list of indices where that XOR value occurs.

Then, for each query, given l and r, and computing S = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1], I can:

- If S=0, find if there's any index m in the range (l-1, r) where prefix[m] = prefix[l-1].

- If S !=0, find if there's any index m1 in the range (l-1, r) where prefix[m1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S, and any index m2 in the range (m1, r) where prefix[m2] = prefix[l-1].

To optimize this, I can use binary search to find the existence of such indices.

For S=0, I can simply check if there's any index m in the list of indices for prefix[l-1] that lies in (l-1, r).

For S !=0, I need to:

- Find all m1 where prefix[m1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S and l-1 < m1 < r.

- For each such m1, check if there's any m2 where prefix[m2] = prefix[l-1] and m1 < m2 < r.

But to make it efficient, perhaps I can just ensure that there exists at least one m1 and at least one m2 such that m1 < m2, with the conditions on their prefix values.

Wait, actually, since m1 and m2 are from different sets, I can check:

- There exists m1 in (l-1, r) where prefix[m1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S.

- There exists m2 in (l-1, r) where prefix[m2] = prefix[l-1], and m2 > m1.

But to ensure m2 > m1, I need to make sure that for some m1, there is m2 > m1 with prefix[m2] = prefix[l-1].

Given that the lists are sorted, I can find the smallest m1 where prefix[m1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S and m1 > l-1.

Then, find the smallest m2 where prefix[m2] = prefix[l-1] and m2 > m1.

If such m2 exists and m2 < r, then it's possible.

To implement this efficiently, I can use binary search to find the lower bounds.

In Python, I can use the bisect module for this.

So, the plan is:

- Precompute the prefix XOR array.

- Create a dictionary where keys are prefix XOR values and values are sorted lists of indices where that XOR value occurs.

- For each query:

- Compute S = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1].

- If S == 0:

- Check if there's any m in the range (l-1, r) where prefix[m] = prefix[l-1].

- If yes, then "Yes", else "No".

- If S !=0:

- Find the smallest m1 where prefix[m1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S and m1 > l-1.

- Then, find the smallest m2 where prefix[m2] = prefix[l-1] and m2 > m1.

- If such m2 exists and m2 < r, then "Yes", else "No".

This seems efficient because for each query, I'm doing a couple of binary searches, which are O(log n), and since q can be up to 2*10^5, this should be acceptable.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently in Python.

I need to be careful with the indexing because arrays are zero-based in code but one-based in the problem statement.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n and q.

- Read the array a of size n.

- Compute the prefix XOR array x, where x[0] = 0, x[1] = a[0], x[2] = a[0] XOR a[1], and so on.

- Create a dictionary inds where inds[key] is a list of indices where prefix XOR equals key.

- For each query:

- Read l and r (one-based indices).

- Compute S = x[r] XOR x[l-1].

- If S == 0:

- Check if there's any m in (l-1, r) where x[m] = x[l-1].

- If yes, "Yes", else "No".

- Else:

- Find the smallest m1 where x[m1] = x[l-1] XOR S and m1 > l-1.

- Then, find the smallest m2 where x[m2] = x[l-1] and m2 > m1.

- If such m2 exists and m2 < r, "Yes", else "No".

To implement the binary searches efficiently, I can use the bisect module in Python.

Specifically, for finding the smallest m1 where x[m1] = x[l-1] XOR S and m1 > l-1, I can use bisect.bisect_right(inds[x[l-1] XOR S], l-1) to find the first index greater than l-1.

Similarly, for m2, I can use bisect.bisect_right(inds[x[l-1]], m1) to find the first index greater than m1.

Then, check if m2 < r.

I need to be careful with the indexing because inds[x] is a list of indices where prefix XOR is x.

Also, since the problem has multiple test cases and large constraints, I need to make sure that the code is optimized and doesn't have any unnecessary computations inside loops.

Now, looking at the given code, I need to verify if it implements this logic correctly.

Let's analyze the given code step by step.

First, there's a function func_1 that reads input and casts it to the specified type.

Then, func_2 seems to be a binary search function that finds the largest index where the predicate is true.

Func_3 and func_4 seem to be variations of binary search, but I need to understand their exact purposes.

In func_5, which handles each test case:

- Read n and q.

- Read the array a.

- Compute the prefix XOR array x, starting with 0.

- Create a dictionary inds where keys are prefix XOR values and values are lists of indices where that XOR value occurs.

- For each query:

- Read l and r (one-based indices).

- Compute S = x[r] XOR x[l-1].

- If S == 0:

- Print "Yes".

- Else:

- Find the smallest m1 where x[m1] = x[r] and m1 < l.

- Find the largest m2 where x[m2] = x[l-1] and m2 <= r.

- If m2 > m1, print "Yes", else "No".

Wait, this seems different from what I thought.

Let me look closely.

In the code:

For S == 0:

- Print "Yes".

For S !=0:

- lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]

- upper = inds[x[l-1]][func_3(inds[x[l-1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]

- If upper > lower:

- Print "Yes"

- Else:

- Print "No"

First, for S ==0, it prints "Yes", which matches my earlier reasoning that if S ==0, it's possible to split into even k >=2.

But in my earlier reasoning, for S !=0, I need to find m1 and m2 as described.

In the code, for S !=0:

- It finds the smallest m1 where x[m1] = x[r] and m1 < l.

- It finds the largest m2 where x[m2] = x[l-1] and m2 <= r.

- If upper > lower, print "Yes".

Wait, this seems off.

In my earlier reasoning, for S !=0, I needed to find m1 where m1 > l-1 and x[m1] = x[l-1] XOR S, and m2 > m1 with x[m2] = x[l-1].

But in the code, it's looking for m1 where m1 < l and x[m1] = x[r], and m2 where m2 <= r and x[m2] = x[l-1].

This doesn't align with my earlier thoughts.

Maybe there's a different way to approach this.

Let me think again.

Suppose I have S !=0.

I need to split the subarray into at least two segments with each segment's XOR equal to T, where T is S for odd k and 0 for even k.

But in this case, since k >=2, and for k even, S must be 0, which is already handled.

For S !=0, I need k odd >=3, with T=S.

But perhaps there's a different way to check for the existence of such a split.

Let me consider that for the subarray from l to r, its XOR is S.

If I can find a split point m where l <= m < r, such that the XOR from l to m is T and from m+1 to r is T, then it's possible.

But for S !=0, T=S.

So, I need to find m where l <= m < r and XOR from l to m = S and XOR from m+1 to r = S.

Given that XOR from l to m = prefix[m+1] XOR prefix[l-1] = S

And XOR from m+1 to r = prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[m] = S

But prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[m] = S

So, prefix[m] XOR S = prefix[r+1]

Therefore, prefix[m] = prefix[r+1] XOR S

But S = prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[l-1]

So, prefix[m] = prefix[r+1] XOR (prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[l-1]) = prefix[l-1]

Wait, so prefix[m] = prefix[l-1]

And from the first condition, prefix[m+1] XOR prefix[l-1] = S

Which is prefix[m+1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

So, for m where prefix[m] = prefix[l-1] and prefix[m+1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S.

This seems like a way to find m.

But in the given code, it's looking for m1 where m1 < l and x[m1] = x[r], and m2 where m2 <= r and x[m2] = x[l-1].

This doesn't seem to align with what I just derived.

Perhaps there's a different approach.

Let me consider that for S !=0, it's possible to split into k=3 segments with T=S.

So, I need two split points m1 and m2 where l-1 < m1 < m2 < r such that:

- XOR from l to m1 is S => prefix[m1+1] XOR prefix[l-1] = S => prefix[m1+1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

- XOR from m1+1 to m2 is S => prefix[m2+1] XOR prefix[m1+1] = S => prefix[m2+1] = prefix[m1+1] XOR S = (prefix[l-1] XOR S) XOR S = prefix[l-1]

- XOR from m2+1 to r is S => prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[m2+1] = S => prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[l-1] = S, which holds.

So, I need m1 and m2 where:

- m1+1 <= m2 < r

- prefix[m1+1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

- prefix[m2+1] = prefix[l-1]

So, m1 ranges from l-1 to r-1 where prefix[m1+1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

And m2 ranges from m1+1 to r-1 where prefix[m2+1] = prefix[l-1]

Given that, I can find the number of m1 and m2 that satisfy these conditions.

But in the given code, it's looking for m1 < l and m2 <=r, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the conditions.

Let me look back at the given code.

In func_5:

For S !=0:

- lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]

- upper = inds[x[l-1]][func_3(inds[x[l-1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]

- If upper > lower:

- Print "Yes"

- Else:

- Print "No"

So, it's finding the smallest m1 where x[m1] = x[r] and m1 < l, and the largest m2 where x[m2] = x[l-1] and m2 <=r.

Then, checking if upper > lower.

But according to my earlier reasoning, for S !=0, I need m1 where m1 > l-1 and x[m1] = x[l-1] XOR S, and m2 where m2 > m1 and x[m2] = x[l-1].

So, the given code seems to be doing something different.

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical connection that I'm missing.

Let me consider that x[r] = prefix[r] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

Because S = prefix[r] XOR prefix[l-1]

So, prefix[r] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

Therefore, x[r] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

So, in the code, inds[x[r]] is the list of indices where x[m] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

Then, func_4 is finding the smallest m1 where x[m1] = x[r] and m1 >=l

Wait, no, func_4 seems to be finding the smallest m1 where x[m1] = x[r] and m1 < l

Similarly, func_3 is finding the largest m2 where x[m2] = x[l-1] and m2 <=r

Then, if upper > lower, it's "Yes"

Wait, perhaps this is a way to check if there's an overlapping between the indices where x[m] = x[r] and m < l, and x[m] = x[l-1] and m <=r.

But I'm getting confused.

Maybe I need to look into the definitions of func_2, func_3, and func_4.

Looking back:

Func_2 seems to be a binary search to find the largest index where the predicate is true.

Func_3 is the same as func_2.

Func_4 seems to be finding the smallest index where the predicate is false.

Wait, in func_4, it's returning l if the predicate is true at l.

Wait, I need to understand these functions better.

Looking at func_2:

It's a binary search to find the largest index where predicate is true.

Func_3 is the same.

Func_4 seems to be finding the smallest index where predicate is false.

But in the context of the code, it's used to find the smallest m1 where x[m1] = x[r] and m1 < l.

But I'm getting lost.

Perhaps I need to consider a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that for S !=0, it's possible to split the subarray into k=3 segments with each segment's XOR equal to S.

So, I need to find two split points m1 and m2 where l-1 < m1 < m2 < r such that:

- XOR from l to m1 = S

- XOR from m1+1 to m2 = S

- XOR from m2+1 to r = S

Which translates to:

- prefix[m1+1] XOR prefix[l-1] = S => prefix[m1+1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

- prefix[m2+1] XOR prefix[m1+1] = S => prefix[m2+1] = prefix[m1+1] XOR S = prefix[l-1] XOR S XOR S = prefix[l-1]

- prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[m2+1] = S => prefix[r+1] XOR prefix[l-1] = S, which holds.

So, I need to find m1 and m2 where:

- m1+1 <= m2 < r

- prefix[m1+1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

- prefix[m2+1] = prefix[l-1]

So, in terms of indices:

- m1 ranges from l-1 to r-1 where prefix[m1+1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S

- m2 ranges from m1+1 to r where prefix[m2+1] = prefix[l-1]

Given that, I can iterate over possible m1 and check if there's m2 > m1 with prefix[m2+1] = prefix[l-1].

But to optimize, since the lists are sorted, I can find the first m1 where m1 > l-1 and prefix[m1+1] = prefix[l-1] XOR S, then find the first m2 where m2 > m1 and prefix[m2+1] = prefix[l-1].

If such m2 exists and m2 < r, then "Yes".

But in the given code, it's looking for m1 < l and m2 <=r, which doesn't align with this.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example:

n=5, q=5

a=[1,1,2,3,0]

Queries:

1. l=1, r=5

Subarray [1,1,2,3,0]

S = x[5] XOR x[0] = 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 1 =0, 0 XOR 2=2, 2 XOR 3=1, 1 XOR 0=1, 1 XOR 0=1.

Wait, prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=0 XOR 1=1

prefix[2]=1 XOR 1=0

prefix[3]=0 XOR 2=2

prefix[4]=2 XOR 3=1

prefix[5]=1 XOR 0=1

So, S = x[5] XOR x[0] = 1 XOR 0 =1

Since S !=0, need to check if there exists m1 and m2 as described.

Need m1 where m1 > 0 and prefix[m1+1] = prefix[0] XOR S = 0 XOR 1 =1

So, m1+1 where prefix[m1+1] =1, i.e., m1+1=1 or 4 or 5.

So, m1=0,3,4

But m1 > 0, so m1=3,4

Then, for each m1, find m2 where m2 > m1 and prefix[m2+1] = prefix[0]=0

So, m2+1 where prefix[m2+1]=0, i.e., m2+1=2, so m2=1

For m1=3, m2=1 is not greater than m1=3.

For m1=4, m2=1 is not greater than m1=4.

So, no such m2 exists.

But according to the example, it should be "Yes".

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

In the example, it's split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], which are all XOR to 1.

So, m1=0 (prefix[1]=1), m2=1 (prefix[2]=0), but m2=1 > m1=0, but prefix[m2+1]=prefix[2]=0 != prefix[0]=0.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.

Let me try to think differently.

I recall that for S !=0, it's possible to split into k=3 segments with T=S if there exists at least two splits where the XOR conditions hold.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that for S !=0, it's possible if the number of times S appears in the prefix XOR array within the range is at least two.

But that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's possible if the number of times prefix[l-1] appears between l and r is at least one, and prefix[l-1] XOR S appears at least once before that.

But I'm getting stuck.

Given that, perhaps the given code has a different approach.

Looking back at the given code, for S !=0, it does:

lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]

upper = inds[x[l-1]][func_3(inds[x[l-1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]

if upper > lower:

print("Yes")

else:

print("No")

In this example, x[r]=x[5]=1, x[l-1]=x[0]=0

So, inds[1] is [1,4,5], inds[0] is [0,2]

func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) is func_4([1,4,5], lambda arg: arg <1)

Since arg <1 is true only for arg=0, but inds[x[r]] starts from 1, so func_4 returns None, then or 0, so lower=inds[1][0]=1

func_3(inds[x[l-1]], lambda arg: arg <=r) is func_3([0,2], lambda arg: arg <=5)

func_3 finds the largest index where arg <=5, which is 2.

So, upper=2

Then, upper > lower: 2 > 1, so "Yes"

But in reality, according to my earlier reasoning, it should be "Yes", so maybe the code is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought it should be "No", but according to the example, it's "Yes".

So, perhaps my earlier reasoning was wrong.

Maybe I need to trust the code's logic.

Let me consider another query from the example.

Query 2: l=2, r=4

Subarray [1,2,3]

S = x[4] XOR x[1] = 1 XOR 1 =0

So, S=0, print "Yes"

Which matches the example.

Query 3: l=3, r=5

Subarray [2,3,0]

S = x[5] XOR x[2] =1 XOR 0=1

So, S !=0

lower = inds[1][func_4(inds[1], lambda arg: arg <3) or 0] = inds[1][func_4([1,4,5], lambda arg: arg <3)]

func_4 finds the smallest m1 where arg >=3, which is 4 (index 1 in the list), so lower=4

upper = inds[0][func_3(inds[0], lambda arg: arg <=5)] = inds[0][1]=2

Then, upper > lower: 2 > 4 is False, so "No"

Which matches the example.

Query 4: l=1, r=3

Subarray [1,1,2]

S = x[3] XOR x[0] =2 XOR 0=2

So, S !=0

lower = inds[2][func_4(inds[2], lambda arg: arg <1) or 0]

inds[2]=[3], func_4([3], lambda arg: arg <1) returns None, so lower=inds[2][0]=3

upper = inds[0][func_3(inds[0], lambda arg: arg <=3)] = inds[0][0]=0

upper > lower: 0 > 3 is False, so "No"

Which matches the example.

Query 5: l=3, r=4

Subarray [2,3]

S = x[4] XOR x[2] =1 XOR 0=1

So, S !=0

lower = inds[1][func_4(inds[1], lambda arg: arg <3) or 0] = inds[1][1]=4

upper = inds[0][func_3(inds[0], lambda arg: arg <=4)] = inds[0][0]=0

upper > lower: 0 > 4 is False, so "No"

Which matches the example.

So, in this test case, the code produces the correct outputs.

Let me check another test case from the example.

Second test case:

n=5, q=5

a=[1,2,3,4,5]

Queries:

1. l=1, r=5

Subarray [1,2,3,4,5]

prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=0 XOR 1=1

prefix[2]=1 XOR 2=3

prefix[3]=3 XOR 3=0

prefix[4]=0 XOR 4=4

prefix[5]=4 XOR 5=1

S = x[5] XOR x[0] =1 XOR 0=1

So, S !=0

lower = inds[1][func_4(inds[1], lambda arg
