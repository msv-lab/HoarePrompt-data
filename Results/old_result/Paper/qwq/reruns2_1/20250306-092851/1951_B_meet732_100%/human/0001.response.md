Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position, and they're going to have a tournament. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between the first two cows, and then the winner keeps competing against the next cow in line. The goal is to maximize the number of wins for a specific cow, k, by possibly swapping its position with another cow only once.

First, I need to understand how the tournament works. It's a single-elimination tournament where the winner of each match proceeds to the next one. The matches are structured so that the winner of the previous match faces the next cow in line. Since all ratings are unique, there are no ties.

My task is to find the maximum number of wins cow k can achieve by possibly swapping its position with another cow before the tournament starts.

Let me think about the initial setup. The cows are in positions 1 to n, and cow k is in position k. I can choose to swap cow k with any other cow or do nothing.

I need to consider where to place cow k to maximize its wins. Since the tournament is a series of matches where the winner faces the next cow, cow k needs to keep winning to accumulate more wins.

The key is to identify a position where cow k can keep winning until it faces a stronger cow. Also, since I can swap cow k with any other cow, I can adjust the order to give cow k an advantage.

Let me consider the original order of the cows and their ratings. Suppose I have the list of ratings a = [a1, a2, ..., an], where ai is the rating of the cow in position i.

In the original setup, the first match is between cow 1 and cow 2. The winner of that match then faces cow 3, and so on, until there's only one cow left.

But in this problem, the tournament proceeds by always having the winner face the next cow in line.

I need to simulate this process for different positions of cow k to see how many wins it can achieve.

But simulating the entire tournament for each possible position of cow k would be too slow because n can be up to 10^5 per test case, and t can be up to 10^4, with the total n across all test cases up to 10^5.

So, I need a smarter approach that can compute the maximum number of wins for cow k in O(n) time per test case or better.

Let me think about the properties of the tournament.

Each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line. So, the number of wins cow k can achieve depends on how many cows with lower ratings it can consecutively defeat before facing a stronger cow.

If I place cow k in a position where it can avoid stronger cows for as long as possible, it can accumulate more wins.

I need to find the optimal position to place cow k such that the number of consecutive cows with lower ratings before encountering a stronger cow is maximized.

Wait, but I can only swap cow k with one other cow, not place it anywhere arbitrarily.

Wait, actually, the problem says I can swap cow k with another cow, meaning I can choose any position for cow k by swapping it with that position's cow.

So, effectively, I can place cow k in any position by swapping it with that position's cow.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says: "you can ask them to swap the position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do nothing."

So, I can choose to swap cow k with any one other cow, or keep it in its original position.

Therefore, I can choose to place cow k in any position, but I have to swap it with that position's cow to achieve that.

Wait, but in terms of the final arrangement, it's equivalent to choosing any position for cow k.

So, I can choose to place cow k in any position, and adjust the positions of the other cows accordingly.

But since I can only perform one swap, I can only choose to swap cow k with one other cow, which changes its position and that cow's position.

Wait, I need to be careful here.

In a single swap, I can choose two positions and swap the cows in those positions.

So, I can choose to swap cow k with any other cow, or choose not to swap at all.

Therefore, I have n options: keep cow k in its original position, or swap it with any one of the other n-1 cows.

So, I need to consider these n possibilities and find the one that maximizes the number of wins for cow k.

But n can be up to 10^5, and t up to 10^4, so I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about how to compute the number of wins for cow k in a given arrangement.

In the tournament, the matches proceed as follows:

- First match: position 1 vs position 2.

- Then, the winner vs position 3.

- And so on, until all cows have been matched.

So, in the original order, the matches are sequential.

But if I swap cow k to position p, then cow k is in position p, and the tournament proceeds with the new order.

Wait, but the tournament structure remains the same: first match is between position 1 and 2, then the winner vs position 3, and so on.

Wait, no. Actually, in the problem statement, it says:

- The first match is between position 1 and position 2.

- Then, each subsequent match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1.

So, it's a sequential tournament where the winner keeps progressing.

So, in the original order, the matches are:

- Match 1: pos1 vs pos2, winner is the one with higher rating.

- Match 2: winner of match1 vs pos3.

- Match 3: winner of match2 vs pos4.

- And so on, until match n-1: winner of match n-2 vs pos n.

So, it's like a single elimination tournament where the current winner faces the next cow in line.

Now, if I swap cow k from position k to position p, then the new order is:

- The cow that was in position p is now in position k.

- Cow k is now in position p.

- All other cows remain in their positions.

Then, the tournament proceeds as before, but with this new order.

I need to compute, for each possible position p (including p=k, which means no swap), how many matches cow k can win.

And then choose the p that maximizes the number of wins for cow k.

But since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with total n across all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me try to model this process.

Let's denote the sequence of cows after the swap as:

- pos1, pos2, ..., pos(p-1), cow_k, pos(p+1), ..., pos(n), where p is the new position of cow k.

Wait, no. If I swap cow k with cow p, then:

- Cow k is now in position p.

- The cow that was originally in position p is now in position k.

So, the sequence becomes:

- pos1, pos2, ..., pos(p-1), cow_k, pos(p+1), ..., pos(k-1), cow_p, pos(k+1), ..., pos(n).

Now, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match1: pos1 vs pos2, winner is the one with higher rating.

- Match2: winner of match1 vs pos3.

- Match3: winner of match2 vs pos4.

- ...

- Match n-1: winner of match n-2 vs pos n.

I need to find, in this sequence, how many matches cow k can win.

But this seems too slow to simulate for each possible p.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of the tournament.

The tournament is a sequence of matches where the current winner faces the next cow in line.

So, the number of wins cow k can achieve depends on how many consecutive cows it can defeat starting from its position p.

But it's not exactly starting from position p, because the tournament proceeds sequentially from position 1.

Wait, no. The tournament proceeds by having the winner of each match face the next cow in line.

So, if cow k is placed at position p, it will have to wait until the winner reaches position p to have a chance to play.

I need to find out how many cows before position p can be defeated by cows with higher ratings before cow k gets a chance to play.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p for cow k.

Then, in the tournament, cow k will participate when it's its turn, i.e., when the winner reaches position p.

The number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position p (including itself) that it can defeat consecutively until it loses.

But actually, it's not that simple because the winner accumulates wins as it progresses.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the tournament as a sequence of matches where the winner progresses.

So, if I have the sequence after the swap:

pos1, pos2, ..., pos(p-1), cow_k, pos(p+1), ..., pos(n)

Then, the matches are:

Match1: pos1 vs pos2, winner W1.

Match2: W1 vs pos3, winner W2.

...

Match p-1: W_{p-2} vs pos(p-1), winner W_{p-1}.

Match p: W_{p-1} vs cow_k, winner W_p.

Match p+1: W_p vs pos(p+1), winner W_{p+1}.

...

Match n-1: W_{n-2} vs pos(n), winner W_{n-1}.

So, cow k participates in match p, and potentially in subsequent matches if it keeps winning.

The number of wins cow k achieves is the number of matches it wins before losing to a stronger cow.

So, if cow k is in position p, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of consecutive cows after position p (including itself) that it can defeat.

But wait, it's not exactly after position p, because it participates in match p, and if it wins, it proceeds to match p+1, and so on.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows from position p to position n that it can defeat consecutively.

Wait, but in reality, it's a bit more involved because the winner accumulates wins as it progresses.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the tournament as a stack or something similar.

Let me try to think in terms of the winner.

Start with the first cow, pos1.

It faces pos2.

The winner faces pos3, and so on.

So, effectively, the winner is the maximum rating among the cows encountered so far.

Wait, no. In each match, the cow with the higher rating wins.

So, the winner is the one with the higher rating between the two cows in each match.

But it's not necessarily the maximum rating overall.

Wait, actually, in a series of matches where the winner faces the next cow, the final winner is the cow with the maximum rating.

Because the cow with the highest rating will defeat all others.

But I need to find out how many wins cow k can achieve.

Let me consider that cow k can only win as long as it has a higher rating than the current winner.

Wait, no. In each match, cow k would be facing the winner of the previous match.

So, if cow k has a higher rating than the winner of the previous match, it wins and becomes the new winner, proceeding to the next match.

Otherwise, it loses.

So, in the sequence, cow k can keep winning as long as its rating is higher than all the previous winners.

But this seems a bit tangled.

Let me try to think recursively.

If cow k is in position p, then:

- If p == 1, it faces pos2.

- If it wins, it faces pos3.

- And so on.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k, until it faces a cow with higher rating.

Wait, but it's not exactly after position p, because it's the winner that faces the next cow.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of how many cows have lower ratings than cow k, starting from its position p, until the first cow with higher rating.

So, if I place cow k at position p, the number of wins it can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position p (including itself) that have lower ratings than cow k, until it faces a cow with higher rating.

Wait, but actually, it's a bit different because it's the winner that faces the next cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of cows that have lower ratings than cow k, starting from the first cow it faces.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to formalize it.

Define the number of wins for cow k when placed at position p as:

- If p == 1: cow k faces pos2.

- If k wins, it faces pos3.

- And so on, until it loses.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than cow k.

But actually, it's the number of cows from position p+1 to position n that have lower ratings than cow k, plus one if it wins the first match.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think step by step.

If cow k is placed at position p:

- It will first face the winner of the previous match, which is the winner of match p-1.

- The winner of match p-1 is the winner between W_{p-2} and pos(p-1).

Wait, this seems too involved.

Maybe I need to consider the tournament in reverse.

Start from the end and see who can potentially face cow k.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p for cow k.

Then, in the tournament, the matches proceed as follows:

- Match1: pos1 vs pos2, winner W1.

- Match2: W1 vs pos3, winner W2.

- ...

- Match p-1: W_{p-2} vs pos(p-1), winner W_{p-1}.

- Match p: W_{p-1} vs cow_k, winner W_p.

- Match p+1: W_p vs pos(p+1), winner W_{p+1}.

- ...

- Match n-1: W_{n-2} vs pos(n), winner W_{n-1}.

Now, cow k participates in match p.

The number of wins cow k achieves is equal to the number of matches starting from match p that cow k wins, until it loses.

So, if cow k wins match p, it proceeds to match p+1, and so on, until it loses.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of matches from p onwards that cow k wins.

Which is equal to the number of cows from position p+1 to n that have lower ratings than cow k, plus one for match p, assuming cow k wins match p.

But, to win match p, cow k needs to have a higher rating than W_{p-1}, the winner of match p-1.

So, I need to know what W_{p-1} is.

So, to compute W_{p-1}, I need to know the winner of the first p-1 matches.

But computing this for each p is too slow for n up to 10^5.

I need a way to precompute the winner up to each position.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the winner up to position i for all i from 1 to n.

Let me define W_i as the winner of the first i cows.

So, W_1 = pos1.

W_2 = winner between W_1 and pos2.

W_3 = winner between W_2 and pos3.

And so on, up to W_{n-1} = winner between W_{n-2} and posn.

Then, W_{n-1} is the final winner of the tournament.

Now, if I place cow k at position p, then:

- The winner up to position p-1 is W_{p-1}.

- Then, in match p, W_{p-1} faces cow_k.

- If cow_k has higher rating than W_{p-1}, it wins and becomes the new winner.

- Then, in match p+1, cow_k faces pos(p+1).

- And so on.

So, the number of wins for cow k is:

- If cow_k's rating > W_{p-1}, then it wins match p and proceeds.

- Then, it faces pos(p+1), pos(p+2), ..., up to the first cow with higher rating than cow_k.

- The number of wins is equal to the number of cows from p to n that have lower ratings than cow_k, plus one for match p, but only if it wins match p.

Wait, no.

Actually, it's equal to the number of cows from p to n that have lower ratings than cow_k, including itself, but only if it can pass the initial match p against W_{p-1}.

So, the total wins are:

- If a_k > W_{p-1}, then the number of wins is 1 (for match p) plus the number of cows from p+1 to n with a_i < a_k.

- Else, it loses match p, so zero wins.

But, I need to maximize this over all possible p.

But I need to be careful because W_{p-1} depends on the arrangement of cows before position p.

Now, since I can choose to place cow k at any position p, and swap it with the cow originally at position p, I need to consider the new arrangement for each possible p.

Wait, but in each case, W_{p-1} is determined by the arrangement before position p.

So, if I place cow k at position p, then the sequence before p is pos1, pos2, ..., pos(p-1), and W_{p-1} is the winner among these cows.

But cow k is now at position p, so in match p, W_{p-1} faces cow_k.

If cow_k wins, it becomes the new winner and proceeds to match p+1, facing pos(p+1), and so on.

So, the number of wins for cow k is:

- 0, if it loses match p.

- Otherwise, 1 (for match p) plus the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than cow_k.

Wait, no. It's 1 for match p, plus the number of subsequent matches it wins.

In each subsequent match, it faces the next cow in line, and wins if its rating is higher.

So, it keeps winning until it faces a cow with higher rating.

Therefore, the total wins is equal to the number of cows from p to n that have lower ratings than cow_k, including itself, minus one because it doesn't count itself as a win.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's clarify:

- Match p: W_{p-1} vs cow_k.

- If cow_k wins, it gets 1 win.

- Then, match p+1: cow_k vs pos(p+1).

- If cow_k wins, it gets another win.

- And so on, until it loses.

So, the total wins is equal to the number of cows from p to n that have lower ratings than cow_k.

Because cow_k wins against each of them, and loses when it faces a cow with higher rating.

Assuming that the cows are ordered from p to n, and cow_k is placed at position p.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows from p to n with a_i < a_k.

But, only if cow_k wins match p, which requires a_k > W_{p-1}.

Otherwise, if a_k <= W_{p-1}, then cow_k loses match p and gets 0 wins.

So, for each p, the number of wins is:

- 0, if a_k <= W_{p-1}.

- Number of cows from p to n with a_i < a_k, otherwise.

I need to maximize this over all p.

Now, to compute W_{p-1}, which is the winner among the first p-1 cows, I can precompute this.

Let me define W[p] as the winner among the first p cows.

Wait, but in this case, since the arrangement changes when I place cow k at position p, I need to adjust for that.

Wait, no. If I place cow k at position p, then the cows before p are pos1, pos2, ..., pos(p-1), and W_{p-1} is the winner among these cows.

So, I can precompute W[p] as the winner among the first p cows in the new arrangement.

But in the new arrangement, cow k is at position p, and the other cows are in their original positions.

Wait, no. If I swap cow k with cow p, then:

- The cows from position 1 to p-1 are unchanged.

- Position p is now cow_k.

- Position k is now cow_p.

- The rest are unchanged.

So, to compute W_{p-1}, which is the winner among the first p-1 cows, I need to consider the original cows in positions 1 to p-1.

Wait, but if I swap cow k with cow p, then:

- If p < k: positions 1 to p-1 are original, position p is cow_k, positions p+1 to k-1 are original, position k is cow_p, positions k+1 to n are original.

- If p > k: positions 1 to k are original except position p is cow_k, positions k+1 to p-1 are original, position p is cow_p, positions p+1 to n are original.

- If p == k: no swap, original positions.

So, in any case, W_{p-1} is the winner among the first p-1 cows in this new arrangement.

This seems too complicated to compute for each p.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that W_{p-1} is the maximum rating among the first p-1 cows in the new arrangement.

Because the winner is the one with the higher rating.

So, W_{p-1} = max(a[1] to a[p-1]) in the new arrangement.

So, in the new arrangement:

- If p < k: a[p] = a_k, and a[k] = a_p.

- If p > k: a[k] = a_p, and a[p] = a_k.

- If p == k: no change.

So, to compute W_{p-1} for each p, I need to compute the maximum rating among the first p-1 cows in the new arrangement.

This seems tricky because W_{p-1} depends on whether p < k or p > k.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute two arrays:

- W1[p]: maximum rating among first p-1 cows, assuming p < k.

- W2[p]: maximum rating among first p-1 cows, assuming p > k.

Wait, but it's getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix p and compute W_{p-1} for that p.

Then, for each p, W_{p-1} is the maximum rating among the first p-1 cows in the new arrangement.

So, for p from 1 to n:

- If p < k: W_{p-1} = max(a[1 to p-1]) where a[p] = a_k and a[k] = a_p.

- If p == k: W_{p-1} = max(a[1 to p-1]) where a[k] = a_p.

- If p > k: W_{p-1} = max(a[1 to p-1]) where a[p] = a_k and a[k] = a_p.

This seems too involved.

Maybe I need to consider the maximum rating up to each position in the original arrangement and handle the swap accordingly.

Let me try to precompute the maximum rating up to each position in the original arrangement.

Let me define prefix_max[i] = maximum rating among a[1 to i].

Then, for p from 1 to n:

- If p == k: W_{p-1} = prefix_max[p-1].

- If p != k: W_{p-1} = max(prefix_max[p-1], a_p) if p > k else prefix_max[p-1].

Wait, no.

Actually, if I swap cow k with cow p, then in the new arrangement:

- a[p] = a_k.

- a[k] = a_p.

- All other positions are unchanged.

So, for p from 1 to n:

- W_{p-1} = maximum rating among a[1 to p-1] in the new arrangement.

So, if p < k:

- a[1 to p-1] are unchanged.

- So, W_{p-1} = prefix_max[p-1].

- a[p] = a_k.

- a[p+1 to k-1] are unchanged.

- a[k] = a_p.

- a[k+1 to n] are unchanged.

- But for W_{p-1}, only a[1 to p-1] matter.

- So, W_{p-1} = prefix_max[p-1].

If p > k:

- a[1 to k-1] are unchanged.

- a[k] = a_p.

- a[k+1 to p-1] are unchanged.

- a[p] = a_k.

- a[p+1 to n] are unchanged.

- So, W_{p-1} = max(prefix_max[k-1], a_p) if k <= p-1, else prefix_max[p-1].

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Let me try to find a different approach.

Let me consider that cow k can be placed at any position p, and I need to maximize the number of wins.

The number of wins is:

- 0, if a_k <= W_{p-1}.

- Plus 1 for match p, and then plus the number of consecutive cows after p with lower ratings than a_k.

Wait, but only if a_k > W_{p-1}.

So, the total wins are:

- 0, if a_k <= W_{p-1}.

- Else, 1 plus the number of cows from p+1 to n with a_i < a_k.

So, for each p, the number of wins is:

wins[p] = 0, if a_k <= W_{p-1}.

Else, 1 + count of a_i < a_k for i from p+1 to n.

I need to maximize this over all p from 1 to n.

Now, to compute W_{p-1}, which is the maximum rating among the first p-1 cows in the new arrangement.

Given that I can precompute the prefix maximum in the original arrangement, I need to adjust for the swap.

Let me define prefix_max_original[i] = max(a[1 to i]) in the
