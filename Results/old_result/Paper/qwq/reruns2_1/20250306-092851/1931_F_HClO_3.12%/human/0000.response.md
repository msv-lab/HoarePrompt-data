Alright, I have this problem to solve. There are n people in a chat, ordered by their activity, but each person sees themselves at the top of the list. So, for each person, their view of the list is different because they see themselves first, followed by the rest in some order.

The problem is that k people posted screenshots of their view of the list, and I need to determine if there's a single underlying order of participants that could produce all these screenshots.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. Each screenshot corresponds to a participant's view, where they see themselves first, followed by the other participants in some order. I need to check if all these views can be consistent with a single actual order of participants.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I notice that in the example provided:

- For n=4, k=4, and the orders are:

  - [1,2,3,4] (from participant 1)

  - [2,3,1,4] (from participant 2)

  - [3,2,1,4] (from participant 3)

  - [4,2,3,1] (from participant 4)

I need to see if there's a single actual order that can produce all these views.

Looking at participant 1's view: [1,2,3,4]. This means participant 1 sees themselves first, followed by 2,3,4.

Participant 2's view: [2,3,1,4]. So, participant 2 sees themselves first, followed by 3,1,4.

Participant 3's view: [3,2,1,4]. Participant 3 sees themselves first, followed by 2,1,4.

Participant 4's view: [4,2,3,1]. Participant 4 sees themselves first, followed by 2,3,1.

If I look at the positions of participants in these lists, I can try to infer the actual order.

Let me consider that the actual order is [2,3,1,4]. Let's see if this matches all the views.

- For participant 1, they see themselves first, so [1,2,3,4]. But the actual order is [2,3,1,4]. So, participant 1 would see [1,2,3,4], which matches their view.

- For participant 2, they see themselves first, so [2,3,1,4], which matches their view.

- For participant 3, they see themselves first, so [3,2,1,4], which matches their view.

- For participant 4, they see themselves first, so [4,2,3,1], which matches their view.

So, in this case, the actual order [2,3,1,4] is consistent with all the views.

Now, what if there is a different set of views? For example, suppose k=2, n=5, and the views are:

- [1,2,3,4,5]

- [2,1,3,4,5]

In this case, the actual order would have to be [2,1,3,4,5], which matches the second view, but the first view is [1,2,3,4,5], which would only be correct if the actual order was [1,2,3,4,5], but that doesn't match the second view. So, these two views are inconsistent.

Therefore, I need a way to check if all the views can correspond to a single actual order.

Let me think about how to model this.

Each view is a permutation where the participant sees themselves first, followed by the others in some order.

So, for each view, the first element is the participant themselves, and the rest is their view of the others.

I need to find if there's a single permutation of the participants such that, for each view, when the participant puts themselves at the top, the rest of the order matches the actual order.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of relative order.

For example, in the first example:

- Participant 1 sees 1, then 2, then 3, then 4.

- Participant 2 sees 2, then 3, then 1, then 4.

- Participant 3 sees 3, then 2, then 1, then 4.

- Participant 4 sees 4, then 2, then 3, then 1.

If I assume the actual order is [2,3,1,4], then:

- For participant 1: [1,2,3,4] matches because in the actual order, after 1, it's 2,3,4.

- For participant 2: [2,3,1,4] matches because after 2, it's 3,1,4.

- Similarly for others.

So, I need to find if there's a permutation where, for each participant, the order of others in their view matches their position in the actual order, except that the participant themselves are always at the top.

I think this can be modeled as a graph problem, where I consider the positions and see if there's a consistent ordering.

Let me consider constructing a graph where nodes are participants, and edges represent the relative order between participants based on their views.

For example, if participant A sees B after themselves, and participant B sees C after themselves, then in the actual order, A should be before B, and B before C.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the positions in the order.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote the actual order as a permutation P = [P1, P2, ..., Pn].

Each participant Ai sees themselves first, followed by Aj1, Aj2, ..., Aj(n-1).

So, in the actual order, Ai should be placed before Aj1, Aj2, etc., according to their view.

Wait, no. More precisely, in Ai's view, the order after Ai is Aj1, Aj2, ..., Aj(n-1).

In the actual order P, the positions of these participants should follow the order Aj1, Aj2, ..., Aj(n-1), except that Ai's position is adjusted to be at the top in their view.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe another approach: Since each participant sees themselves at the top, followed by the rest in some order, and all screenshots were taken within a short period of time (so the order didn't change), I can try to find a permutation P that, for each participant Ai, when Ai is moved to the first position, the rest of the order matches their view.

So, for each participant Ai, their view is [Ai, Aj1, Aj2, ..., Aj(n-1)], and in the actual order P, it should be that P with Ai moved to the front becomes [Ai, Aj1, Aj2, ..., Aj(n-1)].

This seems similar to checking if all the views are consistent with a single permutation P.

Let me consider that P is the actual order.

For each participant Ai, their view is [Ai] followed by the rest of P without Ai, but with Ai moved to the first position.

Wait, no. More precisely, when Ai sees their view, they see themselves at the top, followed by the rest of the participants in some order, which should correspond to the actual order P, but with Ai moved to the front.

So, if P is the actual order, then for each Ai, their view should be [Ai] followed by the participants in P, excluding Ai.

But, in their view, Ai is at the top, and the rest should match the order in P.

Wait, no. Let's think differently.

Suppose P is the actual order.

Then, for each participant Ai, their view is [Ai] followed by the rest of P without Ai, but ordered according to P.

Wait, no. Let's take an example.

Suppose P = [2,3,1,4].

Then, participant 1's view should be [1,2,3,4], which matches moving 1 to the front, and the rest [2,3,4] is the order in P after removing 1.

Similarly, participant 2's view is [2,3,1,4], which matches moving 2 to the front, and the rest [3,1,4] is the order in P after removing 2.

Similarly for others.

So, in general, for a given P, and for each Ai, their view is [Ai] followed by the rest of P without Ai, in the order of P.

So, to check consistency, for all views, the rest of the list after Ai should match the order in P without Ai.

Therefore, I can take one view, say the first one, and assume that the rest of the order is P without Ai.

Then, I can check if this P is consistent with all other views.

So, algorithm:

1. Take the first view, say from participant A1: [A1, B1, B2, ..., B(n-1)].

   - Assume that the actual order P is [A1, B1, B2, ..., B(n-1)].

2. For each other view from participant Ak: [Ak, C1, C2, ..., C(n-1)], check if, in P, after moving Ak to the front, the rest matches [C1, C2, ..., C(n-1)].

   - That is, P without Ak should be equal to [C1, C2, ..., C(n-1)].

3. If all views satisfy this condition with the assumed P, then output "YES"; else, "NO".

But this seems too simplistic, and maybe inefficient for large n and k.

Wait, but in the problem constraints, n and k can be up to 2e5, and n*k up to 2e5, so I need an efficient solution.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have k views, each from a different participant.

Each view is [Ai] followed by the rest of the participants in some order.

I need to find if there exists a permutation P such that, for each Ai, moving Ai to the front of P gives their view.

This sounds like finding a permutation that is consistent with all the views when each participant moves themselves to the front.

This seems similar to finding a permutation where the relative order of participants, excluding the top one, matches each view.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of graph edges.

Let me model this as a graph where nodes are participants, and edges represent the required order between participants based on the views.

For example, if in participant A's view, B comes before C, then in the actual order, B should come before C.

Similarly, in participant B's view, if C comes before A, then in the actual order, C should come before A.

So, I can create a directed graph where an edge from X to Y means X should come before Y in the actual order.

Then, if there are no cycles in this graph, there exists a valid order; otherwise, not.

But I need to be careful about how I construct these edges.

Wait, but in the problem, each participant sees themselves at the top, followed by the rest in some order.

So, for each participant's view, the order of the participants after the top one should be the same as in the actual order.

Therefore, for each view, the relative order of the participants excluding the top one should match the actual order.

So, if I take the actual order P, and for each participant Ai, their view is [Ai] followed by P without Ai.

Therefore, to check consistency, I can take the first view, assume P is [A1, B1, B2, ..., B(n-1)], and then for each other view [Ak, C1, C2, ..., C(n-1)], check if P without Ak is equal to [C1, C2, ..., C(n-1)].

If all views satisfy this, then "YES"; else, "NO".

This seems straightforward, but maybe there are edge cases.

Let me consider k=1.

If there's only one view, then any order is acceptable, because there's no other view to contradict it. So, "YES".

Wait, but according to the sample input, when k=1, it's "YES".

Similarly, when k=2, I need to check if the two views are consistent with a single P.

Let me try to implement this logic.

In code, for each test case:

- Read n and k.

- If k==1, output "YES".

- Else, read the first two views.

- From the first view, assume P is [A1, B1, B2, ..., B(n-1)].

- From the second view, [A2, C1, C2, ..., C(n-1)], check if P without A2 is equal to [C1, C2, ..., C(n-1)].

- If yes, then assume this P and check the remaining k-2 views.

- For each additional view, [Ai, Di1, Di2, ..., Di(n-1)], check if P without Ai equals [Di1, Di2, ..., Di(n-1)].

- If all views satisfy this, "YES"; else, "NO".

But I need to handle the case where k>2 and there might be inconsistencies.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems more complicated.

Let me look at the provided code.

The code does:

- For t test cases:

- Read n and m (m=k).

- If m==1, print "yes".

- Else, read the first two views.

- Process them to see if they are consistent.

- If not, print "no".

- If they are consistent, combine them to form P.

- Then, for the remaining m-2 views, check if they are consistent with P.

- If all are consistent, print "yes"; else, "no".

But the code seems to handle some edge cases, like inserting A2 and A1 into the lists.

I think the code is trying to handle the relative positions of A1 and A2.

Let me see.

In the code:

- Read t.

- For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- If m==1, print "yes".

- Else, read the first two views: [a1, l1] and [a2, l2].

- Create l11 and l22 by removing a2 from l1 and a1 from l2, respectively.

- If l11 != l22, print "no".

- Else, find the positions where a1 and a2 should be inserted.

- Adjust the lists accordingly to form P.

- Then, for the remaining m-2 views, check if their views without themselves match P without them.

- If all match, "yes"; else, "no".

I think this handles the case where A1 and A2 have different positions in each other's views.

Wait, in the code, it seems to handle the insertion points for A1 and A2.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me consider an example where m=2, n=4:

- First view: [1,2,3,4]

- Second view: [2,3,1,4]

In this case, l11 = [2,3,4] without a2=2, so [3,4]

l22 = [3,1,4] without a1=1, so [3,4]

So, l11 == l22, which is [3,4]

Then, idx1 and idx2 are -1, so it just takes l2 and sets P=l2.

Then, for m-2=0 views, no need to check, so "yes".

This matches the first sample input.

Another sample input with m=2, n=5:

- [1,2,3,4,5]

- [2,1,3,4,5]

Here, l11 = [2,3,4,5] without a2=2, so [3,4,5]

l22 = [1,3,4,5] without a1=1, so [3,4,5]

So, l11 == l22, idx1 and idx2 are -1, take l2 as P.

Then, check if P without a1 equals l1 without a2, which is [2,3,4,5] without 1 equals [3,4,5], which matches l1 without a2.

Similarly, P without a2 equals [1,3,4,5], which matches l2 without a1.

So, "yes".

But in the earlier thought experiment, where m=2, n=5:

- [1,2,3,4,5]

- [2,1,3,4,5]

According to this logic, it should be "yes", but earlier I thought it should be "no" because the actual orders don't match.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my thought experiment.

Wait, if P is [2,1,3,4,5], then:

- Participant 1's view should be [1,2,3,4,5], which matches their view.

- Participant 2's view should be [2,1,3,4,5], which matches their view.

So, in this case, "yes".

Earlier, I thought it should be "no", but actually it's "yes".

I must have misremembered.

So, the code seems correct in this case.

Another test case:

m=3, n=3

Views:

- [1,2,3]

- [2,3,1]

- [3,2,1]

Assume P=[1,2,3] from the first view.

Check second view: P without 2 is [1,3], which should match [3,1], but [1,3] != [3,1], so "no".

Similarly, third view: P without 3 is [1,2], which should match [2,1], but [1,2] != [2,1], so "no".

Hence, "no".

But in the sample input, for m=3, n=3, output is "yes".

Wait, let's see the sample input:

3 3

1 2 3

2 3 1

3 2 1

Output: "yes"

But according to my earlier logic, it should be "no".

Wait, maybe my logic is incomplete.

Looking back at the code, it handles insertion points.

Let me see what the code does for this case.

First, m=3, n=3.

Read first two views:

- [1,2,3]

- [2,3,1]

l11 = [2,3] without a2=2 => [3]

l22 = [3,1] without a1=1 => [3]

So, l11 == l22, which is [3]

idx1 and idx2 are -1, so take l2 as P=[2,3,1]

Then, for the third view [3,2,1], check if P without 3 equals [2,1], which is [2,1], and P without 3 is [2,1], which matches, so "yes".

Hence, the code outputs "yes", which matches the sample input.

But according to my earlier thinking, I thought it should be "no", but actually it's "yes".

So, my earlier thinking was incorrect.

Therefore, the code seems correct in this case.

Another sample input:

5 4

3 5 1 4 2

2 5 1 4 3

1 5 4 3 2

5 1 4 3 2

Output: "yes"

Let's see:

First two views:

[3,5,1,4,2] and [2,5,1,4,3]

l11 = [5,1,4,2] without a2=2 => [5,1,4,2]

l22 = [5,1,4,3] without a1=3 => [5,1,4,3]

So, l11 != l22, since [5,1,4,2] != [5,1,4,3]

Hence, print "no"

But in the sample input, output is "yes".

Wait, but according to the code, it should print "no" in this case.

But in the sample input, output is "yes".

Hmm, maybe the code is incorrect.

Wait, let's check the sample input again.

Wait, in the sample input, for t=10, the outputs are:

YES

YES

YES

YES

NO

YES

YES

YES

YES

NO

So, for the 9th test case, output is "YES"

But in my earlier thought process, I thought it should be "no".

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the test cases.

Wait, in the sample input, the 9th test case is:

5 4

3 5 1 4 2

2 5 1 4 3

1 5 4 3 2

5 1 4 3 2

And output is "YES"

But according to the code, it would print "no" because l11 != l22.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me look back at the code.

In the code, after checking l11 != l22, it prints "no".

But in this case, l11 = [5,1,4,2] and l22 = [5,1,4,3], which are different, so it should print "no".

But the sample output for this test case is "YES", which contradicts the code's behavior.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
