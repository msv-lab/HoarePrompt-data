Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, I have some cards with numbers from 1 to n, and for each i from 1 to n, I have a_i cards with number i. Additionally, I can buy k new cards, each with any number from 1 to n. After buying, I arrange all my cards in a line, and I need to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

First, I need to understand what a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] means in this context. It means that in any subarray of length n, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

So, my goal is to arrange all my cards (initial and bought) in a way that maximizes the number of such subarrays.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think the key is to maximize the number of positions where a window of size n contains each number from 1 to n exactly once.

To achieve this, I need to ensure that in as many n-length windows as possible, all numbers from 1 to n are present, each exactly once.

First, I need to consider the frequencies of each number. I have initial counts a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and I can buy up to k additional cards, choosing any numbers from 1 to n.

I need to distribute these k cards in a way that maximizes the number of valid n-length windows.

This seems tricky. Let's try to think differently.

I recall that in sliding window problems, especially those involving permutations, we often look at the frequencies of elements.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as trying to cover as much of the array as possible with non-overlapping permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

But the problem allows overlapping windows, since it says "contiguous subarrays of length n."

So overlapping is allowed.

Hmm.

Let me consider the entire array of length t, where t is the total number of cards after buying k new ones. So t = sum(a_i) + k.

I need to arrange these t cards in a way that maximizes the number of n-length windows that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

I need to maximize the number of positions i where the subarray from position i to i+n-1 is a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n].

This seems complex. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.

I recall that in some problems, the number of windows that are permutations can be calculated based on the frequencies of elements in the array.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion could be applied here, but that seems too slow for the constraints.

Given the constraints, with n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^12, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Wait, but t can be up to sum(a_i) + k, which is up to 2*10^5 * 10^12, which is way too big to handle directly. So I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the frequencies of each number.

Let’s denote f_i as the final frequency of number i after buying k cards.

Initially, f_i = a_i for each i.

I can choose to buy additional cards of any number, so f_i can be increased by any amount up to k.

But I have to distribute k buys among the n numbers, possibly increasing some f_i's.

My goal is to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

I need to think about how the arrangement affects the number of such windows.

One way to maximize the number of valid windows is to arrange the cards in a way that repeats the permutation as much as possible.

For example, if I can arrange the array as [1,2,3,...,n,1,2,3,...,n,...], repeating the sequence as much as possible, then every window of size n would be a permutation, except possibly at the boundaries.

But I need to consider that I might have extra cards of some numbers and fewer of others, and I can buy k more cards to balance this.

So, perhaps the key is to make sure that the frequencies of all numbers are as equal as possible, with possibly some numbers having one more card than others.

This reminds me of the problem of distributing k items into n bins as evenly as possible.

In such a distribution, some bins will have floor((total)/n) items, and some will have ceil((total)/n).

Wait, perhaps I can model this.

Let me think.

Let’s say I have total cards t = sum(a_i) + k.

I need to distribute these t cards in a way that maximizes the number of n-length windows that are permutations.

If I can arrange the array such that it consists of as many repetitions of a permutation of [1,2,...,n] as possible, then the number of such windows would be maximized.

So, I need to find how many complete blocks of n cards, each being a permutation, I can form, and then handle any remaining cards.

Wait, but the arrangement matters. It's not just about how many complete blocks I can form, but also how I arrange them.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as finding the maximum number of times n-length permutation patterns can fit into the array.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimum frequency among all numbers.

Because in order to have a permutation of [1,2,...,n], each number must appear at least once in the window.

So, the limiting factor would be the number with the smallest frequency.

Wait, but it's not just the smallest frequency, because even if one number has a low frequency, I can arrange the array to maximize the number of valid windows.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimum number of times any number appears, and base the number of valid windows on that.

But that might not be accurate.

Let me consider an example.

Take the second example from the input:

n=2, k=4

a=[8,4]

So, I have 8 cards of 1 and 4 cards of 2, and I can buy 4 more cards.

Total cards: 8+4+4=16

I need to arrange these 16 cards to maximize the number of 2-length windows that are permutations of [1,2].

According to the sample output, the maximum score is 15.

Let me see why.

If I arrange the array optimally, say [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2], then there are 15 windows of size 2:

[1,2], [2,1], [1,2], ..., [1,2]

Each of these is a permutation of [1,2], so total score is 15.

So, in this case, the maximum score is 15.

Now, how was this achieved?

By alternating 1 and 2 as much as possible.

But in this arrangement, the frequency of 1 is 8 and of 2 is 8, but initially, I had only 4 cards of 2, and I bought 4 more to make it 8.

So, by buying 4 more cards of 2, I balanced the frequencies of 1 and 2.

Hence, I could create an array of 16 cards with 8 ones and 8 twos, arranged alternately, giving 15 valid windows.

Another way to look at it is that in an array of length t, the number of n-length windows is t - n + 1.

In this case, t=16, n=2, so t - n + 1 = 15, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, by balancing the frequencies, I was able to make all possible windows valid.

But is this always possible?

Suppose in another case, n=2, k=3, a=[3,1]

Total cards: 3+1+3=7

I can buy 3 more cards, say all of type 2, making f_1=3, f_2=4.

Then, in an array of 7 cards, arranged optimally, say [1,2,1,2,1,2,2], the windows are:

[1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,2]

Out of these, the last window [2,2] is not a permutation of [1,2], so only 5 valid windows.

But is this the maximum?

Alternatively, arrange as [1,2,1,2,2,1,2], windows:

[1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,2], [2,1], [1,2]

Here, only one invalid window [2,2], so 5 valid windows again.

Is there a better arrangement?

Wait, t - n +1 = 7 - 2 +1 =6, but one of them is always invalid because f_1=3 and f_2=4.

In any arrangement, there will be at least one window that is [2,2], since there are more twos than ones.

Hence, the maximum number of valid windows is 5.

But according to the problem, we need to maximize the number of valid windows.

So, perhaps the formula is t - n +1 minus the number of invalid windows.

But this seems too vague.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the total number of possible windows, which is t - n +1, and subtract the number of invalid windows.

An invalid window is one that does not contain all numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

So, to maximize the number of valid windows, I need to minimize the number of invalid windows.

An invalid window occurs when at least one number is missing from the window.

But this seems like the inclusion-exclusion principle, but it's too slow for large n.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal frequency.

Suppose I have frequencies f_1, f_2, ..., f_n.

The minimal number of times any number appears is m = min(f_1, f_2, ..., f_n).

Then, the maximum number of valid windows is m * (something).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of valid windows is t - n +1, provided that all f_i >= m, where m is chosen such that m = floor((t - n +1)/n).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array of length t, and I want to arrange it in such a way that as many n-length subarrays as possible are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

To maximize this, I should arrange the array in a repeating pattern of a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

For example, if n=3, I can arrange the array as [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...]

In this case, every n-length window is a permutation of [1,2,3].

The number of such windows is t - n +1.

But to do this, I need to have f_i >= ceil((t)/n) for each i.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the repeating pattern, each f_i should be roughly floor(t/n) or ceil(t/n).

But I need to ensure that each number appears frequently enough.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal possible f_i, and base the number of valid windows on that.

But I need a better approach.

Let me look at the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the total number of cards t = sum(a_i) + k.

I need to choose f_i for each i, such that sum(f_i) = t, and f_i >= a_i for all i.

Then, I need to arrange the cards to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

I think the optimal arrangement is to arrange the cards in a repeating sequence of a permutation of [1,2,...,n], as much as possible.

So, I need to find how many complete blocks of n cards, each being a permutation of [1,2,...,n], I can form, and then handle any remaining cards.

Let me denote m = floor(t / n).

This is the number of complete blocks of n cards.

The remaining cards are t - m * n.

In each complete block, I can have one of each number from 1 to n.

So, for m blocks, I need m cards of each number.

Therefore, the minimal f_i should be at least m.

So, I need f_i >= m for all i.

If I can satisfy this, then I can form m blocks, each contributing one valid window.

But actually, in a sliding window of size n, each complete block contributes n valid windows.

Wait, no.

Wait, in a sequence of n cards that is a permutation of [1,2,...,n], there is only one window of size n that is the entire sequence.

Wait, no.

Wait, in a sequence of n cards that is a permutation, there is only one window of size n, which is the entire sequence.

But in a longer sequence, there are overlapping windows.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times each number appears.

Let me try to find a formula.

Suppose I have f_i cards of each number i, with sum f_i = t.

I need to arrange the cards to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations.

Let me denote s = t - n +1, the number of possible windows.

Each window is a sequence of n cards.

For a window to be a permutation, it must contain exactly one of each number from 1 to n.

So, the total number of such windows is equal to the number of positions where the window contains one of each number.

This seems similar to counting the number of times all n numbers are represented in the window.

I need to maximize this count.

I recall that in streaming algorithms, there are ways to estimate the number of distinct elements in a window, but that's not directly helpful here.

Maybe I can model this problem using the idea of a sliding window and keeping track of the frequency of each number in the window.

But with n up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^12, I need a smarter approach.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal frequency.

Wait, let's consider that in order to have a window that is a permutation, each number must appear at least once in the window.

So, the number of such windows is equal to the number of positions where all n numbers are present in the window.

This is similar to finding the number of positions where the window contains at least one of each number.

To maximize this, I need to maximize the number of positions where all n numbers are present.

This seems related to the inclusion-exclusion principle, but again, that's not practical for large n.

Let me consider the dual problem: minimizing the number of windows that are not permutations.

A window is not a permutation if at least one number is missing from it.

So, the number of invalid windows is the number of windows missing at least one number.

To minimize this, I need to maximize the number of windows that contain all numbers.

But this seems similar to what I had before.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider the frequencies.

If I have f_i cards of number i, then the number of windows that do not contain number i is equal to the sum over j from 0 to t - n +1 of (the number of windows that exclude i and start at position j).

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the total number of invalid windows.

The total number of invalid windows is equal to the sum over all i of the number of windows missing i, minus the sum over all i < j of the number of windows missing both i and j, plus the sum over all i < j < k of the number of windows missing i, j, and k, and so on.

But this is too slow for large n.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that in order to maximize the number of valid windows, I need to maximize the number of positions where all n numbers are present in the window.

This seems to suggest that I need to arrange the cards in a way that the coverage of all n numbers is as extensive as possible.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal frequency of any number.

If the minimal frequency is m, then the number of valid windows is at least (sum of frequencies) - n * m + something.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look at the problem from a different angle.

Suppose I have an array of length t, and I want to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

This is equivalent to maximizing the number of positions i where the subarray from i to i+n-1 contains each number from 1 to n exactly once.

I need to arrange the cards to maximize this count.

I recall that in some scheduling problems, we need to arrange items to maximize certain properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent numbers and edges represent adjacency, but that seems too complicated.

Let me consider that in order to have as many valid windows as possible, I should arrange the cards in a way that the sequence repeats the permutation as much as possible.

So, if I can arrange the sequence as [p1,p2,...,pn,p1,p2,...,pn,...], where [p1,p2,...,pn] is a permutation of [1,2,...,n], then every window of size n would be a permutation, except possibly at the boundaries.

In this case, the number of valid windows would be t - n +1, provided that t is a multiple of n.

But in reality, t may not be a multiple of n, and the frequencies of each number may not allow this perfect repetition.

So, I need to find how many complete blocks of n cards, each being a permutation, I can form, and then handle the remaining cards.

Let me denote m = floor(t / n), which is the number of complete blocks.

Then, the remaining cards are t - m * n.

Now, for each complete block, I can have one of each number.

So, I need at least m cards of each number to form these m blocks.

Therefore, if f_i >= m for all i, then I can form m blocks, each contributing n valid windows.

Wait, no.

Wait, each complete block of n cards that is a permutation contributes one valid window.

But in a sequence of m blocks, each block contributes one valid window, but in reality, there are overlapping windows across blocks.

Wait, no.

In a sequence like [p1,p2,...,pn,p1,p2,...,pn,...], each window of size n within a block is a permutation.

But in reality, the windows overlap between blocks.

Wait, let's think about it differently.

In a sequence of m blocks, each block is a permutation of [1,2,...,n], and the sequence is [b1,b2,...,bm], where each b_j is a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

Then, the number of n-length windows that are entirely within one block is m.

But actually, there are overlapping windows across blocks.

Wait, no.

Each window of size n corresponds to exactly one block in this arrangement.

So, in this arrangement, there are m windows that are permutations.

But in reality, the windows can span across blocks.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing myself.

Let me consider that in a sequence of m blocks, each block being a permutation of [1,2,...,n], arranged consecutively, the number of n-length windows that are permutations is m.

But actually, in such an arrangement, there are t - n +1 windows, but only m of them are entirely within one block.

Wait, no.

Wait, if t = m * n, then the number of windows is t - n +1 = m*n - n +1 = (m-1)*n +1.

But in the arrangement where the sequence is composed of m blocks, each of size n, then the windows that are entirely within one block are m windows.

But there are overlapping windows across blocks.

Wait, no.

In a sequence like [p1,p2,...,pn,p1,p2,...,pn,...], the windows of size n are:

[p1,p2,...,pn], [p2,p3,...,pn+1], [p3,p4,...,pn+2], ..., [pm*n -n +1, ..., pm*n]

Each of these windows is a permutation if the blocks are arranged such that the overlapping parts maintain the permutation property.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps a better way is to think in terms of the number of times each number appears.

Let me consider that to have as many valid windows as possible, I need to maximize the number of positions where each number appears exactly once in every n-length window.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider the minimal frequency among all numbers.

Let m = min(f_i) for all i.

Then, I can have at most m non-overlapping blocks of n cards, each being a permutation.

But this doesn't account for overlapping windows.

Wait, perhaps I can interleave the permutations to maximize the number of overlapping valid windows.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me look back at the sample input.

In the first sample:

n=1, k=10

a=[1]

So, I have 1 card of 1, and I can buy 10 more cards, choosing any number from 1 to 1.

So, I can buy 10 cards of 1, making f_1=11.

Then, the array is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1].

The number of 1-length windows that are permutations of [1] is 11.

So, the output is 11.

This makes sense.

In the second sample:

n=2, k=4

a=[8,4]

So, f_1=8, f_2=4+k=8.

Arrange them as [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2], which has 15 windows, all valid.

So, output is 15.

In the third sample:

n=3, k=4

a=[6,1,8]

Total cards: 6+1+8+4=19

I need to choose f_i such that f_1 + f_2 + f_3 = 19, with f_1 >=6, f_2 >=1, f_3 >=8.

To maximize the number of valid windows, I need to balance the frequencies.

But it's not clear how.

Looking at the output, it's 15, which is t - n +1 = 19 -3 +1=17, but some windows are invalid.

Wait, perhaps the formula is min(f_i) * (something).

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in order to have a window being a permutation, each number must appear exactly once in that window.

So, for a window to be valid, for each number, there must be exactly one occurrence in that window.

To maximize the number of such windows, I need to maximize the number of positions where this condition holds.

This seems similar to maximizing the number of times all frequencies in the window are exactly one.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider the problem in terms of the number of possible windows.

The total number of possible windows is t - n +1.

I need to maximize the number of these windows that are permutations.

To maximize this, I need to minimize the number of windows that are not permutations.

A window is not a permutation if at least one number is missing from it.

So, perhaps I can calculate the number of windows where at least one number is missing, and subtract that from the total number of windows.

This sounds like the inclusion-exclusion principle.

But with n up to 2*10^5, inclusion-exclusion is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that in order for a window to be a permutation, each number must appear exactly once in that window.

So, for each window, I need to ensure that all numbers are present exactly once.

This seems too vague for an efficient solution.

Let me think about the minimal frequency.

Suppose m = min(f_i).

Then, the maximum number of valid windows is m * something.

But I need to relate m to the total number of windows.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times the minimal frequency limits the number of valid windows.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look at the problem from a different perspective.

Suppose I fix the frequencies f_i for each i, with sum f_i = t, and f_i >= a_i.

I need to arrange the cards to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations.

I think the optimal arrangement is to arrange the cards in a way that the sequence repeats the permutation as much as possible.

So, I need to find how many complete blocks of n cards, each being a permutation, I can form.

Let m = floor(t / n).

Then, I can form m blocks, each contributing one valid window.

But actually, in a sliding window, each block contributes n valid windows, but with overlaps.

Wait, no.

In a sequence of m blocks, each block is a permutation, and the windows overlapping between blocks may or may not be permutations.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to find a formula for the maximum number of valid windows.

I think the key is to maximize the minimal frequency among all numbers.

Let’s denote m = floor((t - n +1)/n).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have t cards, and I arrange them in a way that the sequence has as many permutations of [1,2,...,n] as possible.

I need to maximize the number of n-length
