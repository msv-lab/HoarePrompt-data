Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals: one every 'a' minutes and the other every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched. I need to find out the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible. Let's consider the launch times:

- The first installation launches at times: a, 2a, 3a, ..., ka, etc.

- The second installation launches at times: b, 2b, 3b, ..., lb, etc.

Each firework is visible from the launch time up to m minutes after the launch time. So, for a firework launched at time t, it's visible from t to t + m, inclusive.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of these visibility intervals overlap.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since the launches are periodic, the pattern of visibility will repeat at certain intervals. Maybe I can find the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, which would be the interval at which the launch patterns repeat.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let's consider different cases based on the values of a, b, and m.

Case 1: m < a and m < b

In this case, the visibility period of each firework is shorter than the launch intervals of both installations. So, fireworks from one installation don't overlap with each other, and similarly for the other installation. Also, since m is less than both a and b, the visibility periods of fireworks from different installations don't overlap either.

Wait, actually, that might not be true. If m is greater than or equal to the difference between launch times from different installations, there could be overlap.

Wait, let's think again.

If m < a and m < b, then the visibility periods of fireworks from the same installation don't overlap because the next launch is after m minutes have passed from the previous one.

But for fireworks from different installations, their visibility periods could overlap if the launch times are close enough.

Wait, but since a and b are different, their launch times could be at different times, potentially overlapping.

Hmm.

Let me take an example.

Suppose a = 6, b = 7, m = 4.

So, launches:

Installation 1: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...

Installation 2: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, ...

Visibility:

Installation 1:

- 6 to 10

- 12 to 16

- 18 to 22

- 24 to 28

- 30 to 34

Installation 2:

- 7 to 11

- 14 to 18

- 21 to 25

- 28 to 32

- 35 to 39

Looking for overlaps.

At time 7:

- Firework from installation 1 launched at 6 is visible (6-10)

- Firework from installation 2 launched at 7 is visible (7-11)

So, two fireworks visible at time 7.

At time 14:

- Firework from installation 1 launched at 12 (12-16)

- Firework from installation 2 launched at 14 (14-18)

So, two fireworks visible.

Similarly, at other times, it seems like only two fireworks are visible at a time.

So, in this case, the maximum is 2.

Another example:

a = 3, b = 4, m = 10

Launches:

Installation 1: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ...

Installation 2: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ...

Visibility:

Installation 1:

- 3-13

- 6-16

- 9-19

- 12-22

- 15-25

Installation 2:

- 4-14

- 8-18

- 12-22

- 16-26

- 20-30

Looking for overlaps.

At time 6:

- Installation 1: 3-13, 6-16

- Installation 2: 4-14

So, three fireworks visible: two from installation 1 and one from installation 2.

Wait, but actually, each firework is distinct, so from installation 1, the firework launched at 3 is visible from 3-13, and the one at 6 is visible from 6-16.

Similarly, installation 2's firework at 4 is visible from 4-14.

So, at time 6, all three are visible.

But maybe at some other time, more are visible.

Let's check time 12:

- Installation 1: 9-19, 12-22, 15-25

- Installation 2: 8-18, 12-22, 16-26

So, at time 12, we have:

From installation 1: 9-19, 12-22, 15-25

From installation 2: 8-18, 12-22, 16-26

So, that's five fireworks visible at time 12.

Wait, but according to the sample input, for a=3, b=4, m=10, the output is 7.

How is that possible?

Wait, maybe I need to consider more launches.

Let's list more launches.

Installation 1: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, ...

Installation 2: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, ...

Visibility:

Installation 1:

- 3-13

- 6-16

- 9-19

- 12-22

- 15-25

- 18-28

- 21-31

- 24-34

- 27-37

- 30-40

Installation 2:

- 4-14

- 8-18

- 12-22

- 16-26

- 20-30

- 24-34

- 28-38

- 32-42

Now, let's see at time 12:

- Installation 1: 9-19, 12-22, 15-25

- Installation 2: 8-18, 12-22, 16-26

So, that's six fireworks visible.

At time 24:

- Installation 1: 21-31, 24-34, 27-37

- Installation 2: 20-30, 24-34, 28-38

So, that's six fireworks visible again.

But according to the sample, it's 7. So, maybe I'm missing some.

Wait, perhaps at time 12, more fireworks are visible.

Wait, let's list all visible fireworks at time 12:

From installation 1:

- Launched at 3: visible from 3-13 → yes, 12 is in 3-13

- Launched at 6: 6-16 → yes

- Launched at 9: 9-19 → yes

- Launched at 12: 12-22 → yes

From installation 2:

- Launched at 4: 4-14 → yes

- Launched at 8: 8-18 → yes

- Launched at 12: 12-22 → yes

So, total: 4 from installation 1 and 3 from installation 2, totaling 7.

Wait, but in my earlier list, I only had three from installation 1 and three from installation 2. What's wrong here?

Wait, no. At time 12:

From installation 1:

- 3-13: yes

- 6-16: yes

- 9-19: yes

- 12-22: yes

From installation 2:

- 4-14: yes

- 8-18: yes

- 12-22: yes

So, indeed, seven fireworks are visible at time 12.

Similarly, at time 24:

From installation 1:

- 15-25: yes

- 18-28: yes

- 21-31: yes

- 24-34: yes

From installation 2:

- 20-30: yes

- 24-34: yes

- 28-38: yes

So, four from installation 1 and three from installation 2, totaling seven again.

So, the maximum is seven, as per the sample.

Now, how to generalize this.

I need to find a time when the number of visible fireworks is maximized.

Each firework from installation 1 is visible from ka to ka + m, where k is a positive integer.

Similarly for installation 2: lb to lb + m.

I need to find a time t where the number of intervals overlapping t is maximized.

This seems like a classic problem of finding the maximum number of overlapping intervals.

But since the intervals are generated periodically, there might be a smarter way to calculate it without listing all intervals.

Let me think about the launch times and their visibility periods.

For installation 1, the launch times are a, 2a, 3a, ..., up to some maximum time.

Similarly for installation 2: b, 2b, 3b, ...

Each visibility period is m minutes after the launch time.

So, for installation 1, the visibility periods are [a, a + m], [2a, 2a + m], [3a, 3a + m], etc.

Similarly for installation 2: [b, b + m], [2b, 2b + m], [3b, 3b + m], etc.

I need to find a time t where the number of these intervals that contain t is maximized.

To maximize the number of overlapping visibility periods, I need to find a time t that is covered by as many intervals as possible.

One way to approach this is to consider the start and end times of all intervals and find the time with the maximum number of active intervals.

But with large values of a, b, and m, this approach may not be efficient.

I need a mathematical way to calculate this without simulating the entire timeline.

Let me consider the number of visibility periods from each installation that are active at a given time t.

For installation 1, the number of active visibility periods at time t is the number of k such that ka <= t <= ka + m.

Similarly, for installation 2, the number of l such that lb <= t <= lb + m.

So, for installation 1, the number of k where ka <= t and t <= ka + m.

Which can be rewritten as floor((t - m)/a) <= k <= floor(t/a).

Similarly for installation 2: floor((t - m)/b) <= l <= floor(t/b).

The total number of active visibility periods at time t is the sum of these two counts.

So, total = floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b)

I need to maximize this total.

But this seems a bit complicated to maximize directly.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the possible times when the number of active visibility periods can change.

These times are the launch times and the end times of the visibility periods.

So, for installation 1, the visibility periods start at ka and end at ka + m for each k.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, the possible times where the number of active visibility periods changes are at ka, ka + m, lb, lb + m for all integers k and l.

To find the maximum number of overlapping visibility periods, I need to consider these critical times and calculate the number of active visibility periods at those times.

But again, with large values, this isn't practical.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the frequency of launches.

If a and b are co-prime, the launches are spread out.

If a and b have a common divisor, their launch patterns align at multiples of the LCM.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider the number of visibility periods active from each installation separately and then sum them up.

For installation 1, the number of active visibility periods at time t is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for installation 2: floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

So, total active visibility periods at time t is:

floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to maximize this expression over t.

But this seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum possible value of floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

Let me consider that floor(t/x) - floor((t - m - 1)/x) is equal to floor((t - (t - m -1)) / x) = floor((m + 1)/x), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no.

Actually, floor(t/x) - floor((t - m - 1)/x) is equal to the number of multiples of x in the interval [t - m, t].

Wait, more precisely, it's the number of k such that kx <= t and kx >= t - m.

Which is floor(t/x) - floor((t - m - 1)/x)

This is the number of visibility periods from installation 1 active at time t.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, the total is sum of these two.

I need to maximize floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

Let me denote s = floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to find the maximum possible s over all t.

Let me consider t such that t is a multiple of a and b, i.e., t is a multiple of LCM(a, b).

At such t, both floor(t/a) and floor(t/b) are integers, and floor((t - m - 1)/a) and floor((t - m - 1)/b) depend on m and a, b.

But I'm not sure.

Maybe I need to consider t such that t mod a <= m and t mod b <= m.

Wait, perhaps that's a way.

Let me consider that for installation 1, t mod a <= m ensures that t is within m minutes of a launch time from installation 1, meaning that the firework launched at t - (t mod a) is visible at time t.

Similarly for installation 2.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix t and want to compute the number of active visibility periods from each installation.

From installation 1, it's floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for installation 2.

But calculating this for all t is not feasible for large m, a, b.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for large t, floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) is approximately (t - (t - m -1))/a = (m + 1)/a

But since we're dealing with floor functions, it's floor((m + 1)/a)

Wait, no.

Actually, floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) can be equal to floor((t - (t - m -1))/a) = floor((m + 1)/a), but I'm not sure.

Wait, that doesn't seem correct.

Let me take an example.

Let a = 6, m = 4, t = 10

floor(10/6) = 1

floor((10 - 4 -1)/6) = floor(5/6) = 0

So, floor(10/6) - floor((10 - 4 -1)/6) = 1 - 0 = 1

But actually, at t=10, installation 1 has fired firework at t=6, which is visible from 6 to 10, so one firework is visible.

Similarly, for t=12:

floor(12/6) = 2

floor((12 - 4 -1)/6) = floor(7/6) = 1

So, 2 - 1 = 1

At t=12, firework launched at t=6 (6-10) and t=12 (12-16), so two fireworks are visible.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's 2 - 1 = 1, but in reality, two fireworks are visible.

So, the formula floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) seems incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Let me look it up.

The number of k such that ka <= t and ka + m >= t is the number of k where ka <= t <= ka + m

Which is equivalent to ka <= t and t - m <= ka

Which is ceil((t - m)/a) <= k <= floor(t / a)

So, the number is floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1

Wait, but ceil((t - m)/a) can be written as floor((t - m - 1)/a) + 1

So, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Yes, that's the correct formula.

But in the earlier example, for t=12, a=6, m=4:

floor(12/6) - floor((12 - 4 -1)/6) = 2 - floor(7/6) = 2 - 1 = 1

But in reality, two fireworks are visible.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

For t=12, a=6, m=4:

floor(12/6) = 2

floor((12 - 4 -1)/6) = floor(7/6) = 1

So, 2 - 1 = 1, but in reality, two fireworks are visible.

Wait, maybe the formula is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

But in this case, it's giving 1, while actually there are two fireworks visible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

But in this case, it's 2 - 1 = 1, but in reality, two fireworks are visible.

Wait, maybe the formula is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Wait, perhaps I need to add 1.

Let me check for t=12, a=6, m=4:

floor(12/6) = 2

floor((12 - 4 -1)/6) = floor(7/6) = 1

So, 2 - 1 = 1, but in reality, two fireworks are visible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

But in this case, it's giving 1, but there are two fireworks visible.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the number of active visibility periods is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

But in this case, it's 1, but in reality, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in understanding the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a)

Let me try that.

For t=12, a=6, m=4:

floor(12/6) = 2

floor((12 - 4)/6) = floor(8/6) = 1

So, 2 - 1 = 1, but in reality, two fireworks are visible.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

But in this case, it's 2 - 1 = 1, but in reality, two fireworks are visible.

Wait, maybe I need to add 1.

Let me check for t=10, a=6, m=4:

floor(10/6) = 1

floor((10 - 4 -1)/6) = floor(5/6) = 0

So, 1 - 0 = 1, which matches the reality (one firework visible at t=10).

For t=12, floor(12/6) = 2

floor((12 - 4 -1)/6) = floor(7/6) =1

So, 2 -1 =1, but in reality, two fireworks are visible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

But in this case, it's giving 1, but in reality, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that m +1 is the duration, so t - m is the start of the visibility period.

Wait, perhaps the formula is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a)

Let me try that.

For t=12, a=6, m=4:

floor(12/6) =2

floor((12 -4)/6) = floor(8/6) =1

So, 2 -1 =1, but in reality, two fireworks are visible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

But in this case, it's 2 -1 =1, but in reality, it's 2.

I must have a mistake in the formula.

Let me think differently.

The number of k such that ka <= t and ka + m >= t

Which is ka <= t and ka <= t - m

Wait, no.

ka <= t and ka + m >= t

Which is ka <= t and ka >= t - m

So, t - m <= ka <= t

Which means k >= ceil((t - m)/a) and k <= floor(t / a)

So, the number of k is floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a) +1

Similarly for installation
