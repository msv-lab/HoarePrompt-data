Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers doesn't have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bit values must be different.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. Essentially, for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations must differ in all the first 31 bits. That sounds strict. For example, if I have two numbers where any of the first 31 bits are the same, they can't be in the same group.

I need to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy this condition. Each number must be in exactly one group.

Let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a problem related to grouping items based on certain constraints. The constraints here are on the bit patterns of the numbers.

I recall that in graph theory, similar problems can be modeled where each number is a node, and edges connect numbers that cannot be in the same group due to some conflict. Then, the problem reduces to finding the chromatic number of the graph, which is the minimum number of colors (groups) needed to color the nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

But in this case, the constraints are about bit patterns, so maybe there's a smarter way to handle this without constructing a graph, which could be too slow given the constraints (n can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t can be up to 10^4).

Let me think about the properties of the numbers and their bit patterns.

Given that we have to consider only the first 31 bits (bits 1 through 31), and that for any two numbers in the same group, all corresponding bits must be different, this means that for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise AND must be zero. Wait, is that right?

Actually, no. If two numbers have all bits different from position 1 to 31, that means for each bit position, one number has 0 and the other has 1. So, their bitwise AND would indeed be zero, because for each bit, 0 AND 1 is 0.

But is that sufficient? Wait, no. If two numbers have all bits different, their bitwise AND is zero, but if their bitwise AND is zero, it could be that some bits are zero in one number and zero in the other, which would violate the condition because those bits match (both are zero).

Wait, no. The condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values must be different. That means, for each bit position, one number has 0 and the other has 1.

So, their bitwise XOR must be all ones for those 31 bits. Because XOR yields 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same.

Wait, actually, XOR being all ones for bits 1 to 31 would mean that for each of those bits, the two numbers have different values.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for two numbers to be in the same group, their XOR for the first 31 bits must be all ones, i.e., 0b111...1 (31 ones), which is (1 << 31) - 1 in binary.

Wait, (1 << 31) - 1 is 0b111...1 (31 ones), which is correct.

So, for two numbers x and y, x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1 for them to be in the same group.

Wait, but the problem states that for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values must be different. That means, for any two numbers, their XOR for bits 1 to 31 must be all ones.

But actually, the condition is stronger: for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR must be exactly (1 << 31) - 1, which is all ones in the first 31 bits.

But, if we have more than two numbers in a group, this must hold for every pair.

Wait, but if we have three numbers a, b, c in a group, then a XOR b should be all ones, a XOR c should be all ones, and b XOR c should be all ones.

Let me see what that implies.

Suppose a XOR b = all ones (let's denote it as m = (1 << 31) - 1)

And a XOR c = m

Then, b XOR c = (a XOR b) XOR (a XOR c) = m XOR m = 0

But if b XOR c = 0, that means b = c.

But the problem allows duplicate numbers, but in this case, if b = c, then b XOR c = 0, which is not equal to m, unless m is zero, which it's not.

Wait, but m is all ones in the first 31 bits, which is non-zero.

So, unless b = c, which would make b XOR c = 0, which is not equal to m, unless b = c and m is zero, which it's not.

Therefore, in a group, all numbers must be equal, except that their XOR is m.

Wait, but if a XOR b = m and a XOR c = m, then b = c, because b = a XOR m and c = a XOR m.

Therefore, b = c.

So, in a group, all numbers must be equal to a particular value, say a, where a XOR a = 0, which is not equal to m, unless m is zero, which it's not.

This suggests that in a group, there can be only one unique number, because if there are two different numbers, their XOR would be m, which only holds if they are specific values.

Wait, no. If a XOR b = m, then b = a XOR m.

So, in a group, if you have a number a, then the only other number that can be in the same group is a XOR m.

But then, (a XOR m) XOR a = m, which is correct.

But if you have a third number c in the group, then c must satisfy c XOR a = m and c XOR (a XOR m) = m.

Let's see: c XOR a = m => c = a XOR m

And c XOR (a XOR m) = (a XOR m) XOR (a XOR m) = 0, which should be equal to m only if m = 0, which it's not.

Therefore, c cannot be in the same group as a and b = a XOR m.

Hence, each group can contain at most two numbers: a and a XOR m.

Wait, but in the first test case, the output is 4, and there are 4 numbers: 1, 4, 3, 4.

Let's see:

m = (1 << 31) - 1

For these numbers:

1: 0b0001

4: 0b0100

3: 0b0011

4: 0b0100

Their XOR with m would be:

1 XOR m: flips all bits from 1 to 31 in 1

Similarly for others.

But in this case, since n=4 and output=4, it seems like each number needs its own group, meaning they can't be paired with any other number.

Is that because no two numbers satisfy the condition of having all bits different from 1 to 31?

Let's check:

Take 1 and 4:

1: 0b0001

4: 0b0100

Their XOR: 0b0101

Is 0b0101 equal to m=(1<<31)-1? No, because m has 31 ones.

Wait, m is a 31-bit number with all ones, which is 2^31 - 1.

But in this example, the numbers are small, so perhaps we need to consider all 31 bits.

But in Python, integers can have arbitrary bits, but we need to consider the first 31 bits.

Wait, the problem says "considering the 31 least significant bits of the binary representation".

So, we need to look at the least significant 31 bits of each number.

Given that, even small numbers like 1 and 4 have leading zeros in their binary representation.

So, for example:

1 in binary: 0b000...0001 (31 bits)

4 in binary: 0b000...0100 (31 bits)

Their XOR: 0b000...0101

m: 0b111...1111 (31 ones)

So, 0b000...0101 != m, so 1 and 4 cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, check 1 and 3:

3: 0b000...0011

XOR with 1: 0b000...0010 != m

4 and 3: 0b000...0100 XOR 0b000...0011 = 0b000...0111 != m

So, no two numbers in this test case satisfy the condition of having XOR equal to m.

Hence, each number must be in its own group, totaling 4 groups.

That matches the first test case output.

In the second test case:

n=2

a=[0, 2147483647]

2147483647 is 0b111...111 (31 ones)

0 XOR 2147483647 = 0b111...111, which is equal to m.

So, they can be in the same group.

Hence, output is 1.

In the third test case, output is 3, and so on.

So, from this, it seems that numbers can be grouped together if their XOR is equal to m=(1<<31)-1.

Hence, the general approach is to group numbers into sets where each set contains numbers that pairwise XOR to m.

Given that, in the first test case, no two numbers satisfy this, so each number is in its own group.

In the second test case, the two numbers satisfy this, so they can be in the same group.

In the third test case, perhaps there are three such groups needed.

So, the problem reduces to grouping numbers where each group contains numbers that pairwise XOR to m.

Wait, but in the second test case, only two numbers are in the group, and they satisfy XOR equal to m.

But in the first test case, no two numbers satisfy this, so singletons are used.

In the third test case, perhaps there are multiple such pairs or singletons.

Wait, but in the second test case, it's allowed to have a group with only one number? The problem says "several groups", each number must fall into exactly one group.

So, even if a group has only one number, that's acceptable.

But in the second test case, two numbers can be in the same group because they satisfy the condition.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is one in that case.

But in the first test case, no two numbers can be in the same group, so each number needs its own group, hence four groups.

So, the minimal number of groups is determined by how many such pairwise compatible numbers there are.

This sounds like a graph where each number is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if they can be in the same group, i.e., their XOR is equal to m.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have an edge between them.

Wait, but that's the opposite of the standard graph coloring problem.

In standard graph coloring, edges represent conflicts, meaning connected nodes cannot be in the same group.

In this problem, edges represent compatibility: two numbers can be in the same group if they have an edge between them.

Hence, it's more like finding the minimal number of groups such that each group forms an independent set in the compatibility graph.

Wait, no. Actually, in this case, since edges represent compatibility, it's more like clustering the graph into cliques where each clique is a group.

But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of equivalence classes.

If two numbers can be in the same group, and this relation is transitive, then it's an equivalence relation, and we can group numbers into equivalence classes.

But in this problem, the relation "can be in the same group" is not necessarily transitive.

For example, if a can be in the same group as b, and b can be in the same group as c, does that imply a can be in the same group as c?

Given that a XOR b = m and b XOR c = m, then a XOR c = m XOR m = 0.

But a XOR c = 0 implies a = c.

But in this problem, a and c can be the same number, but in that case, a XOR c = 0, which is not equal to m, unless m is zero, which it's not.

Hence, a and c cannot be in the same group unless a = c and m = 0, which it's not.

Therefore, the relation is not transitive.

Hence, it's not an equivalence relation.

So, perhaps another approach is needed.

Let me consider that for each number, it can be paired with at most one other number: the one that XORs with it to give m.

So, for each number a, there is exactly one number b = a XOR m that can be paired with it.

Hence, we can think of pairing numbers where a and b = a XOR m are paired together.

If a number doesn't have its pair (a XOR m) present, then it has to be in its own group.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of singletons plus half the number of pairs (since each pair occupies one group).

Wait, but in the second test case, we have two numbers: 0 and 2147483647.

m = (1 << 31) - 1 = 2147483647.

So, 0 XOR 2147483647 = 2147483647, which is m.

Hence, 0 and 2147483647 can be paired together in one group.

Hence, minimal number of groups is one.

In the first test case, m = 2147483647.

Given numbers: 1,4,3,4.

Let's compute a XOR m for each a:

1 XOR 2147483647 = some value, say x1

4 XOR 2147483647 = x2

3 XOR 2147483647 = x3

4 XOR 2147483647 = x4 = x2

Now, to check if any two numbers a and b satisfy a XOR b = m.

From above:

a XOR b = m iff b = a XOR m.

Hence, for each a, its compatible number is a XOR m.

So, for a=1, compatible number is 1 XOR m = x1

Similarly, for a=4, compatible number is 4 XOR m = x2

For a=3, compatible number is 3 XOR m = x3

For a=4, compatible number is 4 XOR m = x2

Now, in the list, we have:

a: 1,4,3,4

corresponding compatible numbers: x1,x2,x3,x2

Now, to form groups, we can pair a with its compatible number if both are present.

But in this case, x1, x2, x3, x2 are likely not present in the list, because x1, x2, x3 are different from the existing numbers.

Hence, no pair can be formed, so each number must be in its own group, totaling four groups.

In the second test case, a=0 and a=2147483647.

0 XOR m = 2147483647

and 2147483647 XOR m = 0

Hence, they are compatible with each other, so they can be in the same group.

Hence, minimal number of groups is one.

So, general approach:

- For each number a, its compatible number is a XOR m.

- If a XOR m is present in the list, then a and a XOR m can be paired together in one group.

- If a XOR m is not present, then a has to be in its own group.

- Hence, for each pair of a and a XOR m, they can be in one group.

- Any a without its pair has to be in its own group.

- Therefore, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of singletons plus the number of pairs.

Wait, but in terms of minimal groups, each pair reduces the number of groups needed.

Wait, no. Each pair occupies one group, and each singleton occupies one group.

Hence, total groups = number of pairs + number of singletons.

But actually, each pair occupies one group, and each singleton occupies one group.

Hence, total groups = number of pairs + number of singletons.

But to minimize the number of groups, we want to maximize the number of pairs, because each pair allows two numbers to be in one group instead of two.

Wait, but in this problem, since the condition is so strict, and pairs are only possible if a and a XOR m are both present, we have to count the number of such pairs and the number of singletons.

Hence, minimal number of groups is equal to the number of singletons plus the number of pairs.

Wait, but that would be equal to the total number of numbers, which is not minimal.

Wait, no. Each pair reduces the number of groups by one compared to having two singletons.

Wait, let's think carefully.

If two numbers can be in the same group, they form a pair, so instead of two groups, they can be in one group.

Hence, each pair reduces the total number of groups by one.

So, minimal number of groups = total numbers - number of pairs.

Because each pair allows us to put two numbers in one group instead of two separate groups.

Hence, minimal groups = n - number of pairs.

But in the first test case, n=4, number of pairs=0, so groups=4.

In the second test case, n=2, number of pairs=1, so groups=1.

In the third test case, n=5, let's see.

Suppose in the third test case, n=5, and suppose there are two pairs and one singleton, then groups=5 - 2 =3, which matches the output.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, n=3, output=2.

If there is one pair and one singleton, then groups=3 -1=2.

Fifth test case, n=4, output=2, so perhaps two pairs.

Sixth test case, n=4, output=3, which suggests one pair and two singletons: 4 -1=3.

Seventh test case, n=4, output=2, which suggests two pairs.

Eighth test case, n=3, output=2, which suggests one pair and one singleton.

Ninth test case, n=8, output=4, which suggests four pairs or some combination.

Wait, but in the seventh test case, n=4, output=2, which would be two pairs.

But in the sixth test case, n=4, output=3, which would be one pair and two singletons.

Hence, minimal groups = n - number of pairs.

So, to maximize the number of pairs, we need to pair as many numbers as possible with their compatible numbers.

Hence, the approach is:

- For each number a, find if a XOR m is present in the list.

- Count the number of such pairs.

- Then, minimal groups = n - number of pairs.

But we need to ensure that each pair is only counted once.

Hence, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number.

For each number a, if a XOR m is also present, then we can form a pair.

But we need to make sure that we don't double-count pairs.

Hence, for each a, if a XOR m is present, and a has not been paired yet, then form a pair.

But since we might have multiple occurrences of a and a XOR m, we need to handle the counts properly.

Hence, a better way is:

- Initialize a counter with the frequency of each number.

- Initialize groups to 0.

- For each number a in the counter:

- If counter[a] > 0:

- If a XOR m is in the counter and counter[a XOR m] > 0:

- Form a pair:

- groups += 1

- counter[a] -=1

- counter[a XOR m] -=1

- Else:

- Place a in its own group:

- groups +=1

- counter[a] -=1

- Continue until all numbers are assigned to groups.

But this could be inefficient for large n, as it involves iterating through the counter and updating it.

Given the constraints (n up to 2*10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^4), this approach would be too slow because of the nested operations.

We need a faster way to compute the minimal number of groups.

Let me think about the properties of the pairs.

Each pair consists of a number a and its complement a XOR m.

Hence, for each unique a, if a XOR m is present, they can form a pair.

The number of such pairs is min(count[a], count[a XOR m]).

But we need to consider that each pair is formed by one a and one a XOR m.

Hence, the total number of pairs is sum of min(count[a], count[a XOR m]) for all a.

But actually, since each pair consists of a and a XOR m, and we don't want to double-count, we should iterate through unique a and add min(count[a], count[a XOR m]) to the total pairs.

Then, the minimal groups would be n - total_pairs.

Hence, minimal groups = n - sum over a of min(count[a], count[a XOR m])

But, to avoid double-counting, we need to ensure that for each pair (a, a XOR m), we only count it once.

Wait, actually, since a and a XOR m are distinct (unless a XOR m = a, which only happens if m=0, which it's not), we can iterate through the unique a's and add min(count[a], count[a XOR m]) to the total pairs.

Then, minimal groups = n - total_pairs.

But in terms of implementation, this could be optimized.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Create a counter for all numbers.

- Initialize total_pairs to 0.

- For each unique a in the counter:

- If a XOR m is in the counter:

- pairs = min(count[a], count
