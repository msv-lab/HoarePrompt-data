Alright, I've got this problem here. It seems a bit tricky at first glance, but let's break it down step by step. So, the problem is about determining whether it's possible to adjust the radii of some disks in a plane, under certain conditions, such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases, no two disks overlap in a positive area, and disks that were tangent remain tangent.

First, let's understand what's given:

- We have n disks, each with integer coordinates for their centers and positive integer radii.

- No two disks overlap in a positive area, but they can be tangent.

- We need to adjust the radii so that:

  - Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

  - No two disks overlap in a positive area.

  - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

- The new radii can be any positive real numbers, and the centers remain fixed.

Okay, so the key here is to understand the constraints imposed by tangency and non-overlapping.

Let's start by recalling what it means for two disks to be tangent or not to overlap.

- If two disks are tangent, the distance between their centers is exactly equal to the sum of their radii.

- If two disks do not overlap, the distance between their centers is greater than or equal to the sum of their radii.

Given that no two disks overlap in positive area, it means that for any two disks, the distance between their centers is at least the sum of their radii. If it's exactly equal, they are tangent.

Now, the task is to adjust the radii so that:

1. If two disks were tangent, they remain tangent, meaning the distance between their centers should still be equal to the sum of their new radii.

2. If two disks were not tangent, they should still not overlap, meaning the distance between their centers should still be greater than or equal to the sum of their new radii.

3. The sum of all radii should strictly decrease.

Okay, so we need to find new radii for each disk that satisfy these conditions.

Let's think about how to approach this.

First, consider the constraints imposed by tangency. If two disks are tangent, their new radii must sum up to the distance between their centers. This gives us equality constraints.

For disks that are not tangent, their new radii must sum up to no more than the distance between their centers. This gives us inequality constraints.

Our goal is to find new radii that satisfy all these constraints and also make the total sum of radii strictly less than the original sum.

This sounds like an optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to look at it, especially since we're dealing with geometric constraints.

Let me consider the graph where each disk is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if their disks are tangent. This graph represents the tangency relationships.

In this graph, connected components might play a role because within a connected component, the radii of the disks are interdependent through the tangency constraints.

Let's explore this idea.

Suppose we have a connected component of disks where each pair (possibly through a chain) is tangent to each other. In such a component, the radii are linked in a way that changing one affects the others due to the tangency constraints.

So, in a connected component, the radii can be expressed in terms of one another.

Similarly, for disks in different connected components, their radii can be adjusted independently, as long as they don't interfere with each other, which they don't since there are no tangency constraints between them.

Therefore, we can consider each connected component separately.

Now, within a connected component, can we adjust the radii to satisfy the conditions?

Let's consider a single connected component.

In this component, we have disks connected by tangency constraints, which are equality constraints on the sum of radii for adjacent disks.

This resembles a system of linear equations.

If we can solve this system for the new radii, subject to the sum decreasing, then we can adjust the radii as desired.

But wait, in a connected component with multiple disks, the system of equations might have multiple solutions or might be inconsistent.

Wait, actually, in a connected component, once we fix the radius of one disk, the radii of all other disks are determined by the tangency constraints.

So, in a connected component with k disks, we have k-1 equality constraints (since it's a tree, assuming no cycles).

Wait, but actually, the graph might have cycles.

In any case, in a connected graph with n nodes and edges representing equality constraints on sums, the system might have a unique solution up to a scalar, or it might have multiple solutions, depending on the structure.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have a connected component with disks connected by tangency constraints.

We can choose one disk as a reference and express all other radii in terms of its radius.

Then, we can adjust the reference radius to see if we can make the total sum decrease.

But we also have to ensure that no two disks in different connected components violate the non-overlapping condition.

Wait, but since disks in different connected components are not tangent, their radii can be adjusted independently, as long as they don't start overlapping.

But the problem allows us to adjust radii as long as no two disks overlap in positive area, and tangencies are preserved.

So, perhaps, for each connected component, we can adjust the radii independently, as long as the tangency constraints within the component are satisfied.

Then, we need to ensure that the total sum decreases.

But we also need to make sure that after adjusting radii, no two disks from different components start overlapping.

Wait, but since they were not overlapping before, and we are reducing radii, they should not start overlapping.

Wait, no. If we reduce some radii and increase others, it's possible that two disks from different components could start overlapping if their radii are increased in such a way that their sum becomes greater than the distance between their centers.

But the problem allows increasing some radii as long as the total sum decreases.

Wait, but the sum of radii decreasing doesn't necessarily prevent increases in some radii, as long as the total sum decreases.

So, we need to be careful about that.

Perhaps, to simplify, we can consider adjusting radii within each connected component such that the sum of radii in that component decreases, and then the total sum will decrease.

But we need to ensure that this can be done without causing overlaps between disks from different components.

Let's think about that.

Suppose we have two connected components, and their disks are not tangent to each other.

After adjusting radii within each component, we need to ensure that no two disks from different components start overlapping.

Given that they were not overlapping before, and we are adjusting radii while maintaining or preserving the tangency within each component, it's not immediately clear whether they could start overlapping.

Perhaps we need to consider the minimal distances between disks from different components and ensure that the sum of their radii does not exceed those distances after adjustment.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the dual graph where nodes represent disks, and edges represent tangency.

Then, in this graph, connected components correspond to groups of disks that are interconnected through tangency.

Within each connected component, the radii are interdependent due to the tangency constraints.

Between different connected components, the disks are not tangent, so their radii can be adjusted independently, as long as they don't start overlapping.

Now, the problem is to adjust the radii within each connected component such that the sum of radii in that component decreases, while preserving the tangency within the component, and ensuring that no two disks from different components start overlapping.

This seems manageable.

Perhaps, for each connected component, we can find a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases, and then check if this adjustment causes any overlaps between disks from different components.

But checking all possible adjustments seems infeasible.

Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me consider the system of equations imposed by the tangency constraints.

In a connected component with k disks and k-1 tangency constraints (assuming a tree structure), we can express k-1 radii in terms of one reference radius.

Then, we can express the sum of radii in terms of the reference radius and minimize it.

But since the radii are interdependent, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a system of linear equations and see if there's flexibility to decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps thinking in terms of linear algebra could help.

Let's formalize the tangency constraints.

For two tangent disks i and j:

r_i + r_j = d_{ij}, where d_{ij} is the distance between centers.

This is an equality constraint.

For non-tangent disks i and j:

r_i + r_j <= d_{ij}

This is an inequality constraint.

Our goal is to choose new r_i for all i such that:

- All equality constraints are satisfied.

- All inequality constraints are satisfied.

- Sum of all r_i < original sum.

This is an optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints.

To make it easier, perhaps we can fix the equality constraints and see if we can adjust the radii to decrease the sum without violating the inequality constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of graph theory.

Considering the graph where nodes are disks, and edges are tangency constraints, we can perform a graph traversal to assign radii based on the constraints.

Let's consider performing a DFS or BFS from a starting disk in each connected component, assigning radii based on the tangency constraints.

But how does that help in minimizing the sum?

Wait, perhaps we can express all radii in terms of one reference radius in each connected component, and then choose the reference radius to minimize the sum.

Let's try to formalize this.

Suppose we have a connected component with disks a, b, c, where a is tangent to b, and b is tangent to c.

Then, we have:

r_a + r_b = d_ab

r_b + r_c = d_bc

From these, we can express r_b in terms of r_a, and r_c in terms of r_b, and thus in terms of r_a.

Then, the sum r_a + r_b + r_c can be expressed as a function of r_a.

We can then find the value of r_a that minimizes this sum, subject to the constraints that all radii are positive.

This might be a way to approach it.

Let's try to generalize this.

For a connected component with disks labeled 1 to k, and a spanning tree of tangency constraints, we can choose disk 1 as the reference disk, assign r_1 as a variable, and express all other radii in terms of r_1 using the tangency constraints.

Then, the sum of radii is a linear function of r_1.

We can find the slope of this linear function.

If the slope is positive, increasing r_1 increases the sum, and vice versa.

If the slope is zero, the sum is constant.

In the former case, we can choose r_1 to make the sum decrease, provided we can adjust r_1 appropriately without violating other constraints.

Wait, but since the sum is linear in r_1, if the slope is positive, decreasing r_1 decreases the sum, but we have to ensure that all radii remain positive.

Similarly, if the slope is negative, increasing r_1 decreases the sum.

If the slope is zero, the sum is constant, and we cannot change it.

So, for each connected component, if the sum is not constant, we can adjust r_1 to decrease the sum, as long as we don't violate the positivity of radii and the non-overlapping constraints with other components.

But how do we ensure that?

This seems complicated.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider the dual graph again.

In the dual graph, edges represent tangency constraints.

If a connected component has at least one disk that is not part of a cycle, perhaps we can adjust the radii in that component to decrease the sum.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps considering the rank of the system of equations can help determine if there's flexibility in adjusting the radii.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me look back at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

In the first sample input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

Presumably, some of these disks are tangent, and others are not.

In the explanation, it says that decreasing the radii of the first and third disk by 0.5 and increasing the second disk's radius by 0.5 results in a decrease of 0.5 in the total sum, while preserving tangencies.

So, in this case, it's possible.

In the second sample input:

4

2 2 2

7 2 3

7 7 2

2 7 3

The output is NO, meaning it's not possible to adjust the radii as desired.

Looking at these examples, perhaps there's a condition that determines whether it's possible or not.

Maybe it has to do with the structure of the tangency graph.

Perhaps if the tangency graph is a tree, or if it has cycles, it affects the possibility of adjusting radii.

Wait, in the first sample, the tangency graph might have cycles or not, and in the second sample, it's different.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a connected component, if there's a cycle, the system of equations might be inconsistent or have multiple solutions.

But in this problem, since all disks are given with initial radii that satisfy the tangency constraints, the system is consistent.

So, in a connected component, the radii are fully determined up to a constant, or perhaps there's some flexibility.

Wait, perhaps in a connected component, the radii can be scaled by a common factor, preserving tangencies, but that might not help in decreasing the sum.

Wait, no, scaling radii by a common factor would not necessarily preserve tangencies unless the scaling factor is 1.

Wait, actually, scaling all radii in a connected component by the same factor would preserve tangencies only if the scaling factor is 1, because tangency requires exact sums.

So, that's not a useful approach.

Let me try to think in terms of linear algebra.

Suppose in a connected component with k disks and m tangency constraints.

Each tangency constraint gives an equation of the form r_i + r_j = d_{ij}.

This is a system of linear equations.

The number of equations is m, and the number of variables is k.

If the system is independent, the number of free variables is k - m.

But in this case, since the graph is connected, and m is at least k - 1 (if it's a tree), the number of free variables is at most 1.

In other words, in a connected component, the radii are determined up to a single parameter.

This aligns with what I thought earlier: choose one reference radius, and express all others in terms of it.

Then, the sum of radii is a linear function of this reference radius.

So, in each connected component, the sum of radii can be expressed as a linear function of one reference radius.

Therefore, for each connected component, the sum can be increased or decreased by adjusting the reference radius, depending on the coefficient of that reference radius in the sum.

But we also have to ensure that all radii remain positive and that disks from different components do not start overlapping.

This seems manageable.

Let's formalize this.

For each connected component, express the sum of radii as a linear function of a reference radius r_ref.

Let's say sum = a * r_ref + b, where a is the coefficient and b is a constant.

If a != 0, then we can adjust r_ref to make the sum smaller, as long as we don't violate the positivity of radii and the non-overlapping constraints with other components.

If a == 0, then the sum is constant, and we cannot change it.

Therefore, if there exists at least one connected component where a != 0, then it's possible to decrease the total sum by adjusting the reference radius in that component.

Otherwise, if for all connected components a == 0, then the total sum cannot be decreased.

Wait, but we need to ensure that adjusting the radii in one component doesn't cause overlaps with other components.

But since the components are not tangent to each other, and their radii are adjusted independently, as long as we don't increase the sum of radii between components beyond their minimal distances, we should be fine.

But this might be too hand-wavy.

Let me think more carefully.

Suppose we have two connected components, A and B, with no tangency between them.

This means that for any disk in A and any disk in B, their initial sum of radii is less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

If we adjust the radii within A and within B independently, as long as the new sums of radii for any pair of disks from different components still satisfy the non-overlapping condition, we're good.

But since we are allowed to increase some radii as long as the total sum decreases, it's possible that increasing some radii in A could cause overlaps with B if not careful.

However, if we ensure that for any disk in A and any disk in B, the sum of their new radii is less than or equal to the distance between their centers, we prevent overlaps.

But enforcing this for all pairs across components might be too restrictive and hard to compute efficiently.

Perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that in the initial configuration, for any two disks from different components, their sum of radii is less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

If we adjust the radii within a component, we need to ensure that for any disk in that component and any disk in another component, the sum of their new radii does not exceed the distance between their centers.

This seems complicated to enforce directly.

Maybe instead of trying to adjust radii across multiple components, we can focus on adjusting radii within a single component and see if that allows us to decrease the total sum without causing overlaps.

Wait, perhaps it's sufficient to check for each connected component whether the sum of radii can be decreased within that component without causing overlaps with other components.

But how?

Let's consider that for a connected component, if we can decrease its total sum of radii without changing the sums with disks in other components, then the overall sum decreases without causing overlaps.

But since the sums with other components are determined by the distances between centers, which are fixed, and the radii in other components are being adjusted independently, it's not straightforward.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the key is to observe that if a connected component has a non-constant sum of radii, meaning the sum can be adjusted by changing the reference radius, then we can decrease the sum in that component, provided we don't violate the positivity of radii and the non-overlapping constraints with other components.

But to make sure that we don't violate the non-overlapping constraints with other components, we need to ensure that for any disk in the adjusted component and any disk in another component, the sum of their new radii is less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

This seems too involved to check directly for large n.

Perhaps there's a simpler condition that can determine whether it's possible to decrease the total sum without causing overlaps.

Let me consider the dual graph again.

If the dual graph is such that each connected component has a certain property, perhaps related to the cycles or the structure of the component, that allows or prevents the adjustment of radii to decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps considering the rank of the system of equations can help.

In linear algebra, for a system of m equations with k variables, the number of free variables is k - m, assuming the equations are independent.

In our case, in a connected component with k disks and m tangency constraints (edges), if the graph is connected, m is at least k - 1.

Therefore, the number of free variables is at most 1.

If the graph has more edges (i.e., m > k - 1), it might have dependencies, and the number of free variables could be less.

But since the initial radii satisfy all constraints, the system is consistent.

Therefore, in a connected component, the radii can be expressed in terms of one reference radius, provided there are no conflicting constraints.

Now, if there are conflicting constraints, the system might be inconsistent, but in our case, it's given that the disks are configured without positive area overlaps, so the initial radii satisfy all constraints.

Therefore, for each connected component, we can express all radii in terms of one reference radius.

Then, the sum of radii in the component is a linear function of the reference radius: sum = a * r_ref + b.

If a != 0, then by adjusting r_ref, we can make the sum larger or smaller, depending on the sign of a.

If a == 0, then the sum is constant and cannot be changed.

Therefore, if there exists at least one connected component where a != 0, then it's possible to decrease the total sum by adjusting the reference radius in that component.

Otherwise, if for all connected components a == 0, then the total sum cannot be decreased.

But we need to ensure that when adjusting the reference radius, we don't make any radius non-positive, and we don't cause overlaps with disks from other components.

First, to ensure that all radii remain positive, we need to choose r_ref such that all expressed radii are positive.

Second, to ensure no overlaps with disks from other components, we need to ensure that for any disk in the adjusted component and any disk in another component, the sum of their new radii is less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

This seems complicated to enforce directly, but perhaps under the condition that the sum in the component can be decreased, it's possible to adjust the radii without violating these constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that if a connected component has a non-constant sum, then it's possible to decrease the sum without causing overlaps, assuming that the component is not too interconnected with others in a way that would cause overlaps.

But this is still vague.

Let me consider the first sample input.

In the first sample, there are 5 disks, and it's possible to adjust the radii to decrease the sum.

Presumably, at least one connected component has a non-constant sum.

In the second sample, it's not possible, perhaps because all connected components have constant sums.

Therefore, perhaps the answer is simply whether there exists at least one connected component where the sum of radii is not constant, i.e., where a != 0.

But to confirm, let's think about what a != 0 means.

In the linear function sum = a * r_ref + b, a represents the coefficient of r_ref in the sum.

If a != 0, then changing r_ref changes the sum.

If a == 0, then the sum is constant regardless of r_ref.

Therefore, if a != 0, we can adjust r_ref to decrease the sum, provided we can choose r_ref appropriately without violating the positivity of radii and the non-overlapping constraints with other components.

But how can we ensure that?

Well, assuming that the component is adjusted independently, and that the distances between components are maintained, it might be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps in practice, it's sufficient to check if there exists at least one connected component where a != 0.

If so, then it's possible to decrease the total sum; otherwise, it's not.

This seems to be the approach taken in the provided program.

Looking at the code:

- It reads n disks with their centers and radii.

- It initializes visited array to keep track of visited disks.

- It initializes coef0 and coef1 arrays, which seem to represent coefficients in the linear expressions.

- It iterates through each disk, and for each unvisited disk, it sets coef0[i] = 0 and coef1[i] = 1, and performs a DFS to assign coefficients to the connected component.

- During DFS, for each tangent disk, it sets coef0[j] and coef1[j] based on the tangency constraint.

- After DFS, it calculates c0 and c1 as the sum of coef0 and coef1 in the component.

- If c1 != 0 for any component, it sets ok = True.

- Finally, it prints 'YES' if ok is True, else 'NO'.

So, it seems that c1 represents the coefficient a in the sum = a * r_ref + b.

If c1 != 0, then it's possible to adjust r_ref to change the sum.

Therefore, if there's at least one connected component with c1 != 0, it's possible to decrease the total sum.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

This seems to be the logic.

But is this correct?

Well, based on our earlier reasoning, it seems plausible.

However, we need to ensure that adjusting the radii in one component doesn't cause overlaps with other components.

The provided program doesn't seem to check for that.

So, perhaps there's a missing piece.

Alternatively, maybe in the problem's constraints, adjusting the radii in one component doesn't affect the non-overlapping conditions with other components, as long as the sum in the component can be decreased.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose we have two connected components that are not tangent to each other.

In each component, we can adjust the radii independently.

If in one component, we can decrease the sum, and in the other, the sum is constant, then overall, we can decrease the total sum.

But we need to ensure that after adjustment, no two disks from different components start overlapping.

Given that they were not overlapping before, and we are decreasing the sum in one component, it's likely that the distances between components are maintained or increased, preventing overlaps.

But this is not rigorous.

Perhaps in practice, as long as we can find at least one connected component where the sum of radii is not constant, it's possible to decrease the total sum without causing overlaps.

Given that the problem allows increasing some radii as long as the total sum decreases, it's possible that in some components, radii are increased, while in others, they are decreased,
