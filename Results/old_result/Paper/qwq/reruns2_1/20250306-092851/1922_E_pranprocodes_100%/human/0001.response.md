Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly X, where X can be up to 10^18. If it's not possible, I should output -1. There are multiple test cases, up to 1000 of them.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence obtained by removing some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing. Also, even if subsequences have the same values, if they correspond to different positions, they are considered different.

So, for example, in the array [1, 2, 1], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty subsequence

- [1]

- [2]

- [1] (from the second position)

- [1,2]

- [1,1] (but this is not strictly increasing, so it should be excluded)

- [1,2,1] (not strictly increasing)

So, the valid increasing subsequences are: empty, [1], [2], [1], [1,2]. That's 5 in total. Looking at the example output, for X=5, the output is an array of length 3: [0,1,0]. Let's check the increasing subsequences for [0,1,0]:

- Empty

- [0] (first position)

- [1]

- [0] (third position)

- [0,1]

That's 5 subsequences, which matches X=5.

Another example in the output is for X=13, with the array [2,2,3,4,2]. Let's list the increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [2] (first)

- [2] (second)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2] (fifth)

- [2,3]

- [2,4] (from first 2)

- [2,4] (from second 2)

- [3,4]

- [2,3,4] (from first 2)

- [2,3,4] (from second 2)

That's 12, plus the empty one, but I may have missed some. Wait, X=13, so perhaps I need to count more carefully.

Anyway, the problem is to find such an array for a given X, with at most 200 elements.

First, I need to find a way to construct an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

I recall that in an array that is strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, where n is the length of the array, because every subset is an increasing subsequence.

But here, X can be up to 10^18, and n is at most 200, since 2^200 is way larger than 10^18.

But the problem allows for any array, not necessarily strictly increasing, so I need to think about how the number of increasing subsequences is calculated in a general array.

I need to find a way to construct an array where the number of increasing subsequences sums up to X.

I need to think about how to build such an array efficiently.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting to construct such an array by choosing elements in a specific way.

Let's analyze the given program step by step.

The function func() is defined, which seems to handle multiple test cases.

It reads the number of test cases using int(input()), then for each test case, it reads X.

It initializes max to 10^7 and min to -10^7. These seem to be bounds for the elements in the array.

It initializes an empty list ans, which will store the array elements.

It also initializes t to 0, which seems to count the number of elements in the array.

Then, there is a loop that continues until X becomes 1.

Inside the loop, it checks if X is even. If X is even, it appends the current max to the answer list, decreases max by 1, and sets X to X//2.

If X is odd, it appends the current min to the answer list, increases min by 1, and subtracts 1 from X.

After each operation, it increments t by 1.

Once the loop ends, it reverses the answer list and prints t (the length of the array) and the array itself.

So, the approach seems to be building the array by choosing either the current max or min based on whether X is even or odd, and adjusting X accordingly.

I need to verify if this approach correctly results in an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

First, I need to understand how the number of increasing subsequences is related to the choices made in the program.

I recall that in a sequence where elements are chosen in a specific order, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated based on the structure of the sequence.

However, I'm not immediately seeing how the provided program ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Let me consider a small example to see if this works.

Take X=2.

According to the program:

- X=2, which is even.

- Append max=100000000 to ans.

- Set X=1.

- t=1.

- Reverse ans, which is now [100000000].

- Output 1 and [100000000].

In this case, the array is [100000000]. The increasing subsequences are empty and [100000000], which is 2, matching X=2.

Another example, X=5.

- X=5, which is odd.

- Append min=-100000000 to ans.

- Set X=4.

- t=1.

- X=4, which is even.

- Append max=100000000 to ans.

- Set X=2.

- t=2.

- X=2, which is even.

- Append max=99999999 to ans.

- Set X=1.

- t=3.

- Reverse ans, which is now [99999999, 100000000, -100000000].

- Output 3 and [99999999, 100000000, -100000000].

But in the example output, for X=5, it's [0,1,0]. So, different array, but as long as it has 5 increasing subsequences, it's acceptable.

I need to check if the array constructed by the program has exactly X increasing subsequences.

Let me try to think about the logic behind the program.

It seems to be building the array by choosing either the current max or min based on whether X is even or odd, and then adjusting X accordingly.

This reminds me of binary representation, where each bit decides whether to include something or not.

But in this problem, it's about counting increasing subsequences, which is more complex than just binary choices.

I need to think about how the number of increasing subsequences is calculated.

I recall that in a sequence, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated by considering each element and counting how many increasing subsequences end with that element.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent X in terms of contributions from each element in the array.

Looking back at the program, it seems to be building the array in a way that each choice of appending max or min corresponds to a binary decision that affects X.

Wait, perhaps it's inspired by the binary representation of X.

Let's consider that.

In binary, each bit represents a power of 2.

Similarly, in this problem, perhaps each element in the array contributes to doubling the number of increasing subsequences or adding a certain amount.

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have an array with elements a1, a2, ..., an.

If I add a new element that is larger than all previous elements, then the number of increasing subsequences doubles, because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or exclude the new element.

Wait, that sounds promising.

If I have an array of strictly increasing elements, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, because each subset is an increasing subsequence.

But in this problem, X can be up to 10^18, and n is at most 200, so 2^200 is way larger than 10^18.

But the problem allows for any array, not necessarily strictly increasing.

So, perhaps by choosing elements carefully, I can control the number of increasing subsequences.

Looking back at the program, it seems to be building the array by choosing elements in a way that allows it to accumulate the number of increasing subsequences to exactly X.

It's using a loop where it divides X by 2 when X is even and subtracts 1 when X is odd, similar to the binary representation process.

Wait, actually, this resembles the process of converting a number to binary.

In binary, each bit represents whether to include that power of 2 or not.

Similarly, here, by choosing to append max or min, it's deciding whether to double the number of subsequences or to add one.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to build the array such that the number of increasing subsequences corresponds to the binary representation of X.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array where each element is chosen to be either smaller or larger than the previous elements in a specific way.

If I have a sequence where each new element is smaller than all previous elements, then each new element added doesn't increase the number of increasing subsequences beyond what was already there.

Because to have an increasing subsequence, I can't include a smaller element after a larger one.

Wait, but actually, if I add a smaller element, it can start new subsequences, but it won't extend existing ones.

Wait, no, if I have [1,2,3], and I add 0 at the end, the new array is [1,2,3,0]. The increasing subsequences are all the previous ones plus any subsequence starting with 0 and followed by larger elements.

But in this case, since 0 is smaller than all previous elements, it can only be in a subsequence by itself.

So, adding a smaller element only adds one new subsequence: the subsequence consisting of just that element.

Similarly, adding a larger element than all previous ones doubles the number of increasing subsequences, because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or exclude the new element.

Wait, that seems correct.

So, if I have an array of length n, and I add a new element larger than all previous ones, the number of increasing subsequences becomes twice the previous number, because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include the new element or not.

If I add a new element smaller than all previous ones, the number of increasing subsequences increases by 1, because only the subsequence consisting of just that element is new.

So, in this way, I can build the array step by step, choosing to add either a large element (doubling the number of subsequences) or a small element (adding one subsequence).

This corresponds to the binary representation of X.

Each time X is even, I choose to double the number of subsequences by adding a large element.

Each time X is odd, I choose to add one subsequence by adding a small element.

This way, I can build the array in reverse, starting from X and dividing by 2 or subtracting 1 accordingly.

Then, in the end, I reverse the array to get the correct order.

That makes sense.

So, the program seems to be implementing this logic.

It initializes max to 10^7 and min to -10^7.

Then, while X !=1:

- If X is even, append max to the answer, decrease max by 1, and set X = X // 2

- Else, append min to the answer, increase min by 1, and set X = X -1

Then, reverse the answer and output it.

Wait, but in the example, for X=5, it outputs [0,1,0], but according to this, it might be choosing different values.

But since the problem allows any array with elements in [-1e9,1e9], and the example uses 0 and 1, it's acceptable.

I need to confirm if this logic correctly results in an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

Let me try to simulate it for X=5.

Start with X=5.

5 is odd: append min=-1e7, min becomes -1e7+1, X=4

X=4, even: append max=1e7, max becomes 1e7-1, X=2

X=2, even: append max=1e7-1, max becomes 1e7-2, X=1

Now, ans = [-1e7, 1e7, 1e7-1]

Reverse it: [1e7-1, 1e7, -1e7]

Let's see the increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [1e7-1]

- [1e7]

- [-1e7] (only by itself)

- [1e7-1,1e7]

That's 5 subsequences, which matches X=5.

Another test: X=13.

13 is odd: append min=-1e7, min=-1e7+1, X=12

12 even: append max=1e7, max=1e7-1, X=6

6 even: append max=1e7-1, max=1e7-2, X=3

3 odd: append min=-1e7+1, min=-1e7+2, X=2

2 even: append max=1e7-2, max=1e7-3, X=1

ans = [-1e7,1e7,1e7-1,-1e7+1,1e7-2]

Reverse it: [1e7-2,-1e7+1,1e7-1,1e7,-1e7]

Let's count the increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [1e7-2]

- [-1e7+1]

- [1e7-1]

- [1e7]

- [-1e7]

- [1e7-2,1e7-1]

- [1e7-2,1e7]

- [-1e7+1,1e7-1]

- [-1e7+1,1e7]

- [1e7-1,1e7]

- [1e7-2,-1e7+1,1e7-1]

- [1e7-2,-1e7+1,1e7-1,1e7]

Wait, but X=13, and I've listed 13 subsequences. So, it seems correct.

Another test case: X=37.

37 is odd: append min=-1e7, min=-1e7+1, X=36

36 even: append max=1e7, max=1e7-1, X=18

18 even: append max=1e7-1, max=1e7-2, X=9

9 odd: append min=-1e7+1, min=-1e7+2, X=8

8 even: append max=1e7-2, max=1e7-3, X=4

4 even: append max=1e7-3, max=1e7-4, X=2

2 even: append max=1e7-4, max=1e7-5, X=1

ans = [-1e7,1e7,1e7-1,1e7-2,1e7-3,1e7-4,1e7-5]

Reverse it: [1e7-5,1e7-4,1e7-3,1e7-2,1e7-1,1e7,-1e7]

This array is strictly increasing except for the last element, which is much smaller.

Counting increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [1e7-5]

- [1e7-4]

- [1e7-3]

- [1e7-2]

- [1e7-1]

- [1e7]

- [-1e7]

- [1e7-5,1e7-4]

- [1e7-4,1e7-3]

- [1e7-3,1e7-2]

- [1e7-2,1e7-1]

- [1e7-1,1e7]

- [1e7-5,1e7-4,1e7-3]

- [1e7-4,1e7-3,1e7-2]

- [1e7-3,1e7-2,1e7-1]

- [1e7-2,1e7-1,1e7]

- [1e7-5,1e7-4,1e7-3,1e7-2]

- [1e7-4,1e7-3,1e7-2,1e7-1]

- [1e7-3,1e7-2,1e7-1,1e7]

- [1e7-5,1e7-4,1e7-3,1e7-2,1e7-1]

- [1e7-4,1e7-3,1e7-2,1e7-1,1e7]

- [1e7-5,1e7-4,1e7-3,1e7-2,1e7-1,1e7]

- [1e7-5,1e7-4,1e7-3,1e7-2,1e7-1,1e7,-1e7] (not increasing)

So, total of 23 subsequences, but X=37. Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I missed some.

Wait, perhaps the array is not strictly increasing, but in this case, it seems mostly increasing except for the last element, which is much smaller.

Wait, maybe I need a better way to calculate the number of increasing subsequences.

Is there a formula or a dynamic programming way to calculate the number of increasing subsequences in an array?

Yes, dynamic programming can be used to calculate the number of increasing subsequences.

Let me think about a DP approach.

Define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending at index i.

Then, dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for j in 0 to i-1 if a[j] < a[i]) + 1

Total number of increasing subsequences is sum(dp[i] for all i)

But for large n=200, this is manageable.

But in this problem, n can be up to 200, and t can be up to 1000, so it's feasible.

But I need to confirm if the provided program correctly constructs the array to have exactly X increasing subsequences.

From the earlier simulation, for X=5 and X=13, it seems to work.

For X=37, my manual count didn't match, but perhaps I missed some subsequences.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the program is correct, and my manual count is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe there are constraints I'm missing.

Wait, the problem allows elements to be in [-1e9,1e9], and the array length is at most 200.

The program seems to be building the array by choosing elements that are either current max or current min, adjusting them each time.

But I'm not entirely sure if this always results in exactly X increasing subsequences.

Maybe I need to think about it differently.

Suppose I have built an array with t elements, and it has Y increasing subsequences.

Now, I add a new element:

- If it's larger than all previous elements, the number of increasing subsequences becomes Y*2, because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or exclude the new element.

- If it's smaller than all previous elements, the number of increasing subsequences becomes Y + 1, because only the subsequence consisting of just this element is new.

So, if I represent X in binary, where each bit decides whether to add a large element (to double the number of subsequences) or a small element (to add one subsequence), I can build the array accordingly.

This seems similar to the provided program's approach.

But in the program, it's appending max or min based on whether X is even or odd, and adjusting X accordingly.

Wait, actually, it's similar to representing X in binary, where each bit decides whether to add a small element (odd X) or a large element (even X).

By doing this, it builds the array in reverse order, starting from the least significant bit.

Then, it reverses the array at the end to get the correct order.

This seems like a valid approach.

Let me try to think about it for X=5.

Binary representation of 5 is 101.

So, starting from the least significant bit:

- LSB is 1 (odd): add a small element, X -=1 -> X=4

- Next bit is 0 (even): add a large element, X /=2 -> X=2

- Next bit is 1 (odd): add a small element, X -=1 -> X=1

Then, reverse the array.

So, for X=5, it adds small, large, small, and reverses it to large, small, small.

But in the example, it's [0,1,0], which seems different, but as long as it has the correct number of increasing subsequences, it's fine.

Another thought: perhaps the program can be simplified by choosing elements that are either increasing or decreasing, based on whether we want to double the number of subsequences or add one.

But I need to confirm if this logic always holds.

Wait, perhaps there are cases where this approach fails.

Let me consider X=3.

- X=3 (odd): append min, min +=1, X=2

- X=2 (even): append max, max -=1, X=1

- ans = [min, max]

- Reverse to [max, min]

Now, count increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [max]

- [min]

That's 3, which matches X=3.

Another test: X=4.

- X=4 (even): append max, max -=1, X=2

- X=2 (even): append max, max -=1, X=1

- ans = [max1, max2]

- Reverse to [max2, max1]

Now, count increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [max2]

- [max1]

- [max2, max1] (not increasing, since max2 > max1)

So, only 3 subsequences, but X=4. That's a problem.

Wait, according to the program, for X=4:

- X=4 even: append max=1e7, max=1e7-1, X=2

- X=2 even: append max=1e7-1, max=1e7-2, X=1

- ans = [1e7,1e7-1]

- Reverse to [1e7-1,1e7]

- Increasing subsequences: empty, [1e7-1], [1e7], [1e7-1,1e7] (not increasing)

Wait, [1e7-1,1e7] is actually increasing because 1e7-1 < 1e7.

Wait, no, 1e7-1 is less than 1e7, so it is increasing.

So, subsequences are:

- Empty

- [1e7-1]

- [1e7]

- [1e7-1,1e7]

That's 4, which matches X=4.

Wait, in my earlier thought, I mistakenly thought [max2, max1] is not increasing, but in this case, it is increasing.

Wait, no, in the X=4 case, [1e7-1,1e7] is increasing because 1e7-1 < 1e7.

But in my earlier thought, I had [max2, max1], assuming max2 > max1, but in this construction, max2 < max1 after reversing.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in assuming max2 > max1.

In the program, max is decremented each time, so max2 = max1 -1, which is smaller than max1.

Therefore, [max2, max1] is increasing.

So, for X=4, it correctly gives 4 subsequences.

Another test: X=6.

- X=6 even: append max=1e7, max=1e7-1, X=3

- X=3 odd: append min=-1e7, min=-1e7+1, X=2

- X=2 even: append max=1e7-1, max=1e7-2, X=1

- ans = [1e7, -1e7, 1e7-1]

- Reverse to [1e7-1, -1e7, 1e7]

- Increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [1e7-1]

- [-1e7]

- [1e7]

- [1e7-1,1e7]

- [-1e7,1e7]

That's 6 subsequences, which matches X=6.

Seems correct.

Another test: X=1.

- If X=1, the loop doesn't run, ans is empty, which has only the empty subsequence, so it's correct.

Now, is there any X for which this approach doesn't work?

I need to think about whether this method can always construct an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, and n is at most 200, which is sufficient since 2^200 is much larger than 10^18.

Also, the program ensures that the array is built in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X, by doubling or adding one based on the binary representation of X.

Therefore, it seems that this approach is correct.

Hence, the answer is **True**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
