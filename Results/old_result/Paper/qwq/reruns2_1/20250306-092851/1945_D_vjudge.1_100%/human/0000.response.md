Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n+1. He doesn't like waiting, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue after some series of swaps. Each swap has a cost associated with it, and I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to achieve his goal.

First, I need to understand the rules of swapping. If Kirill is at position i, he can choose any position j where j < i and swap places with the person at position j. The cost for this swap is a_j coins, and additionally, for every person between j and i (that is, for each k such that j < k < i), Kirill has to pay b_k coins.

Okay, so Kirill can perform this operation any number of times, and I need to find the minimum total cost for him to reach one of the first m positions.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to consider all possible positions where Kirill can end up in the first m positions, and calculate the cost for each scenario, then choose the minimum among those.

But that sounds inefficient, especially since n can be up to 200,000, and t, the number of test cases, can be up to 10,000. So, I need a efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider what operations Kirill can perform. He can swap with anyone ahead of him, paying a_j for the person he swaps with, plus b_k for each person in between.

Wait a minute, this seems similar to moving Kirill forward in the queue by swapping him with people in front, and each such swap has a cost.

I need to find the cheapest way to move Kirill from position n+1 to some position between 1 and m.

This sounds like a path with costs, where each possible swap is an edge with a certain cost, and I need the minimum cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

But considering n can be up to 200,000, I need a way that's linear or close to linear time.

Let me think differently. Suppose Kirill wants to reach position p, where 1 <= p <= m. What would be the cost for him to reach position p?

To reach position p, he needs to swap with everyone from position p to position n one by one, essentially pushing those people back and moving himself forward.

Wait, but the swapping is not just with immediate neighbors; he can swap with anyone ahead of him.

Actually, he can choose to swap with anyone ahead, not just adjacent people, which makes it more flexible.

Let me consider the cost if he directly swaps with position p. According to the rules, the cost would be a_p plus the sum of b_k for p < k < n+1.

Wait, k is from j < k < i, where j = p and i = n+1, so k from p+1 to n.

So, the cost to swap with position p would be a_p + sum of b_k from k = p+1 to n.

But can he directly swap with position p, or does he have to swap step by step?

Wait, according to the problem, he can choose any j < i and swap with j, paying a_j and paying b_k for each k between j and i.

But since he can do this any number of times, perhaps there's a way to combine these operations to get the minimal cost.

Let me consider that he can perform multiple swaps. Each swap allows him to move forward to position j, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from j+1 to i.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to model this.

Let me consider the queue as positions from 1 to n+1, where Kirill is at position n+1.

He wants to be in one of the positions from 1 to m.

He can perform operations to swap with anyone ahead of him, i.e., anyone with a lower position number.

Each such swap has a cost of a_j plus the sum of b_k for j < k < i.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where positions are nodes, and there are edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimum cost path from n+1 to any position from 1 to m.

But with n up to 200,000, building such a graph is impractical due to time and space constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform these operations any number of times, and I need to find the minimal cost to reach position p, for any p from 1 to m.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal cost to reach each position p, and then take the minimum over p from 1 to m.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, maybe I can consider that Kirill can perform a series of swaps, each time choosing to swap with someone ahead, and accumulating the costs.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from position n+1.

Then, dp[n+1] = 0.

To compute dp[i], I need to consider all possible ways to reach i from n+1.

But that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position p.

To do that, he needs to swap with position p, paying a_p plus sum of b_k from p+1 to n.

Alternatively, he could swap with some position q between p and n, then swap with p, and so on.

But this seems too convoluted.

Let me consider that each swap operation allows Kirill to move from position i to position j, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, in terms of positions, if he moves from i to j, he's paying a_j plus sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

In this context, i is his current position, and j is the position he's swapping with, where j < i.

He can do this any number of times, and he wants to reach some position p, where 1 <= p <= m.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach any p from n+1.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform these swap operations in sequence, and I need to find the sequence that minimizes the total cost to reach within the first m positions.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where positions are nodes, and there is an edge from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from n+1 to any node from 1 to m.

But again, with n up to 200,000, building such a graph is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform these operations in a way that allows him to "jump" from his current position to any position ahead, paying the corresponding cost.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

Perhaps I can consider that Kirill can choose to swap with position p, and in doing so, he pays a_p plus the sum of b_k from p+1 to n.

Then, he can choose to swap with another position q < p, paying a_q plus sum of b_k from q+1 to p.

And so on, until he reaches some position within the first m.

But this seems like a recursive process, and it's not clear how to optimize it.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of choosing a sequence of positions p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 < p2 < ... < pk, and pk <= m, and for each swap from pi to pi+1, Kirill pays a_pi + sum of b_k from pi+1 to n.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Kirill decides to reach position p directly from position n+1.

The cost would be a_p + sum of b_k from p+1 to n.

Alternatively, he could first swap with position q, where p < q < n+1, paying a_q + sum of b_k from q+1 to n+1, and then from position q, swap with position p, paying a_p + sum of b_k from p+1 to q.

Total cost would be a_q + sum_{k=q+1}^{n} b_k + a_p + sum_{k=p+1}^{q-1} b_k.

Wait, this seems more complicated.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that allows me to compute the minimal cost without considering all possible sequences of swaps.

Perhaps I can consider that each person from position p to n has a certain cost associated with moving Kirill forward, and I need to select a subset of these people to swap with, in a way that minimizes the total cost.

This sounds like a minimization problem, possibly solvable with dynamic programming or some greedy approach.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

Suppose I consider that Kirill needs to move from position n+1 to position p, and to do that, he needs to "bypass" everyone from position p to position n.

He can do this by swapping with some of these people, paying certain costs.

I need to find the minimal cost to bypass everyone from p to n.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting a subset of people from p to n, such that Kirill can swap with them in a certain order to reach p, minimizing the total cost.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different angle.

Suppose I fix the final position p of Kirill, where 1 <= p <= m.

Then, the cost to reach p is a_p + sum of b_k from p+1 to n.

Because Kirill swaps directly from n+1 to p, paying a_p and paying b_k for each k from p+1 to n.

But maybe there's a way to reduce this cost by swapping with intermediate positions.

Wait, perhaps I can find a better way by considering that Kirill can swap with someone at position q, then with someone at position r, and so on, until he reaches p.

But calculating all possible sequences is not feasible.

Is there a way to simplify this?

Let me consider that the total cost to reach p via some sequence of swaps is equal to the sum of a_j for each swap, plus the sum of b_k for each position between the swapped positions.

This seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to find a way to compute, for each p from 1 to m, the minimal cost to reach p, and then take the minimal among those.

But how to compute the minimal cost to reach p?

Wait, maybe I can consider that the minimal cost to reach p is simply a_p plus the sum of b_k from p+1 to n, because swapping directly from n+1 to p would cost a_p plus sum of b_k from p+1 to n.

But perhaps there's a way to do better by swapping through intermediate positions.

For example, suppose there is a position q, p < q < n, where a_q is much smaller than a_p, and the sum of b_k from q+1 to n is not too large.

Then, swapping first to q, then to p might be cheaper than swapping directly to p.

So, in some cases, swapping through intermediate positions could lead to a lower total cost.

Therefore, simply taking a_p + sum_{k=p+1}^{n} b_k for each p and choosing the minimal might not be correct.

I need to find a way to account for these possible chains of swaps.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider a small example to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first sample input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

According to the code, it computes c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in 0 to 3]

c = [min(7,4), min(3,3), min(6,8), min(9,5)] = [4,3,6,5]

Then, it computes suff[5] = 0

suff[4] = suff[5] + c[3] = 0 + 5 = 5

suff[3] = suff[4] + c[2] = 5 + 6 = 11

suff[2] = suff[3] + c[1] = 11 + 3 = 14

suff[1] = suff[2] + c[0] = 14 + 4 = 18

suff[0] = suff[1] + 0 = 18 + 0 = 18

Then, for i in 0 and 1 (since m=2), it computes a[i] + suff[i+1]

For i=0: a[0]=7 + suff[1]=18 → 25

For i=1: a[1]=3 + suff[2]=14 → 17

So, the minimum is 17, but in the sample output, it's 14.

Wait, that doesn't match the sample output. So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back, the code defines func_1(n, k, a, b):

c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]

suff = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]

ans = float('inf')

for i in range(k):

ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])

print(ans)

In the sample input, n=4, k=2, a=[7,3,6,9], b=[4,3,8,5]

c = [min(7,4)=4, min(3,3)=3, min(6,8)=6, min(9,5)=5]

suff = [0] * 5

suff[4] = suff[5] + c[3] = 0 + 5 = 5

suff[3] = suff[4] + c[2] = 5 + 6 = 11

suff[2] = suff[3] + c[1] = 11 + 3 = 14

suff[1] = suff[2] + c[0] = 14 + 4 = 18

suff[0] = suff[1] + 0 = 18 + 0 = 18

Then, for i in range(2):

i=0: a[0]=7 + suff[1]=18 → 25

i=1: a[1]=3 + suff[2]=14 → 17

So, ans = min(25,17) = 17, but the sample output is 14.

So, either the code is wrong, or I misread something.

Wait, perhaps the suff array is incorrect.

Looking at the code, suff = [0] * (n + 1), then for i from n-1 downto 0, suff[i] = suff[i+1] + c[i]

So, suff[i] is the sum of c[j] for j from i to n-1.

In the sample, suff[4] = 5

suff[3] = 5 + 6 = 11

suff[2] = 11 + 3 = 14

suff[1] = 14 + 4 = 18

suff[0] = 18 + 0 = 18

Wait, but in the code, suff = [0] * (n + 1), and suff[i] = suff[i+1] + c[i]

Yes, that's correct.

Then, for i in range(k):

ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i+1])

So, i=0: a[0]=7 + suff[1]=18 → 25

i=1: a[1]=3 + suff[2]=14 → 17

So, ans=17, but sample output is 14.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to understand the logic behind the code.

The idea seems to be that for each possible final position p (from 0 to k-1), the cost to reach p is a[p] plus the sum of c[j] from j=p+1 to n-1, where c[j] = min(a[j], b[j]).

Then, the minimal among these is the answer.

But in the sample input, this gives 17, but the correct answer is 14.

So, either the code is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is indeed 17, but the sample output says 14.

Wait, let's check the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

4

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

7 7

7 2 9 2 6 5 9

9 1 10 7 1 4 9

2 1

2 3

1 1

Sample Output:

14

22

9

3

But according to the code, for the first test case, it should output 17, but the sample output is 14.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I have misindexed the arrays.

In Python, lists are 0-indexed.

In the problem, positions are from 1 to n, but in the code, a and b are lists from index 0 to n-1.

So, position 1 corresponds to index 0, position 2 to index 1, etc.

So, for n=4, positions 1,2,3,4 correspond to indices 0,1,2,3.

Kirill starts at position 5 (n+1=5).

He wants to be in positions 1 or 2 (m=2).

According to the code, for each p from 0 to 1 (positions 1 and 2):

cost = a[p] + sum(c[j] for j from p+1 to 3)

c = [4,3,6,5]

For p=0:

a[0]=7 + c[1]+c[2]+c[3]=3+6+5=14 → total 21

Wait, that's different from what I calculated earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating suff[i].

Let me recalculate suff[i]:

suff[4] = 0 + c[3] = 0 + 5 = 5

suff[3] = suff[4] + c[2] = 5 + 6 = 11

suff[2] = suff[3] + c[1] = 11 + 3 = 14

suff[1] = suff[2] + c[0] = 14 + 4 = 18

suff[0] = suff[1] + 0 = 18 + 0 = 18

Wait, but in the code, c is defined as [min(a[i],b[i]) for i in range(n)], which is [4,3,6,5].

But in my earlier calculation, I had suff[1] = suff[2] + c[0], but c[0] is 4, so suff[1] = 14 + 4 = 18.

Then, for p=0: a[0]=7 + suff[1]=18 → 25

For p=1: a[1]=3 + suff[2]=14 → 17

But sample output is 14, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the correspondence between positions and indices.

In the problem, positions are 1 to n+1, but in the code, a and b are defined for positions 1 to n.

In the code, a and b are lists from index 0 to n-1, corresponding to positions 1 to n.

Position n+1 is Kirill's starting position.

So, when computing suff[i], it's sum of c[j] from j=i to n-1.

Then, for p from 0 to k-1, cost = a[p] + suff[p+1]

In the first test case, n=4, k=2, a=[7,3,6,9], b=[4,3,8,5], c=[4,3,6,5], suff=[18,14,11,5,0]

Then, for p=0: a[0]=7 + suff[1]=14 → 21

For p=1: a[1]=3 + suff[2]=11 → 14

So, the minimum is 14, which matches the sample output.

I must have made a mistake earlier in calculating suff[1]. It should be suff[1] = suff[2] + c[0] = 14 + 4 = 18, but according to the code, suff[i] = suff[i+1] + c[i], so suff[1] = suff[2] + c[1] = 14 + 3 = 17.

Wait, no, in the code, c = [min(a[i],b[i]) for i in range(n)], which is [4,3,6,5]

suff = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]

So, suff[4] = 0 + 5 = 5

suff[3] = 5 + 6 = 11

suff[2] = 11 + 3 = 14

suff[1] = 14 + 4 = 18

suff[0] = 18 + 0 = 18

Then, for p=0: a[0]=7 + suff[1]=18 → 25

For p=1: a[1]=3 + suff[2]=14 → 17

But sample output is 14, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code or my understanding.

Wait, maybe the suff array is supposed to be sum from i+1 to n, not from i to n-1.

Wait, in the code, suff[i] = suff[i+1] + c[i]

So, suff[i] represents the sum of c[j] from j=i to n-1.

Therefore, for p=0: a[0] + sum(c[j] for j from 1 to 3) = 7 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 21

For p=1: a[1] + sum(c[j] for j from 2 to 3) = 3 + 6 + 5 = 14

So, the minimum is 14, which matches the sample output.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought suff[1] was 18, but actually suff[1] = suff[2] + c[1] = 14 + 3 = 17, but according to the code, c[1]=3, suff[2]=14, so suff[1]=14 + 3=17.

Wait, no, in the earlier calculation, c=[4,3,6,5], suff[4]=0 + 5=5, suff[3]=5 + 6=11, suff[2]=11 + 3=14, suff[1]=14 + 4=18, suff[0]=18 + 0=18.

So, for p=0: a[0]=7 + suff[1]=18 → 25

For p=1: a[1]=3 + suff[2]=14 → 17

But sample output is 14, which is consistent.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, in this case, the code outputs 17, but sample output is 14.

Wait, no, according to the above, for p=1: 3 + 14 = 17, but sample output is 14.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the positions.

Wait, maybe p is from 1 to m, inclusive, but in the code, p is from 0 to k-1.

Wait, in the code, p is from 0 to k-1, corresponding to positions 1 to k.

But in the problem, positions are from 1 to n+1, but p is from 1 to m.

So, perhaps the code is correct, and the sample output is 14.

Wait, but according to the above calculation, for p=1, cost=3+14=17, but sample output is 14.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Kirill can perform multiple swaps.

Perhaps the direct swap is not the only way.

Wait, maybe there's a way to reduce the cost by swapping through intermediate positions.

Let me consider that.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position 1.

Option 1: Direct swap from 5 to 1, paying a_1=7 + sum of b_k from 2 to 4: b[2]+b[3]+b[4]=8+8+4=20 → total 27

Option 2: Swap from 5 to 4, paying a_4=9 + sum of b_k from 5 to 5=0 → 9

Then, swap from 4 to 2, paying a_2=3 + sum of b_k from 3 to 4: b[3]+b[4]=8+4=12 → total 9 + 12 = 21

Then, swap from 2 to 1, paying a_1=7 + sum of b_k from 2 to 2: b[2]=8 → total 21 + 7 + 8 = 36

Wait, that's worse than direct swap.

Alternatively, swap from 5 to 3, paying a_3=6 + sum of b_k from 4 to 4: b[4]=4 → 10

Then, swap from 3 to 1, paying a_1=7 + sum of b_k from 2 to 2: b[2]=8 → total 10 + 7 + 8 = 25

Still worse than direct swap.

Wait, maybe there's a better sequence.

Swap from 5 to 2, paying a_2=3 + sum of b_k from 3 to 4: b[3]+b[4]=8+4=12 → total 15

Then, swap from 2 to 1, paying a_1=7 + sum of b_k from 2 to 2: b[2]=8 → total 15 + 7 + 8 = 30

Still worse.

Seems like the direct swap to position 1 is the cheapest for position 1, which is 27, but according to the code, it's 25, but sample output is 14.

Wait, perhaps reaching position 2 is cheaper.

Let's calculate for position 2.

Option 1: Direct swap from 5 to 2, paying a_2=3 + sum of b_k from 3 to 4: b[3]+b[4]=8+4=12 → total 15

Option 2: Swap from 5 to 4, paying a_4=9 + sum of b_k from 5 to 5=0 → 9

Then, swap from 4 to 2, paying a_2=3 + sum of b_k from 3 to 4: b[3]+b[4]=8+4=12 → total 9 + 12 = 21

Worse than direct swap.

Option 3: Swap from 5 to 3, paying a_3=6 + sum of b_k from 4 to 4: b[4]=4 → 10

Then, swap from 3 to 2, paying a_2=3 + sum of b_k from 3 to 3: b[3]=8 → total 10 + 3 + 8 = 21

Worse than direct swap.

So, the minimal cost to reach position 2 is 15.

But according to the code, for p=1: a[1]=3 + suff[2]=14 → 17

Wait, but in reality, the minimal cost is 15, but the code gives 17.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand what the code is doing.

The code computes c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])

Then, suff[i] = sum of c[j] from j=i to n-1

Then, for each p from 0 to k-1, cost = a[p] + suff[p+1]

Then, take the minimal among these costs.

In the first test case:

c = [4,3,6,5]

suff = [18,14,11,5,0]

For p=0: 7 + 18 = 25

For p=1: 3 + 14 = 17

Minimal is 17, but sample output is 14.

So, the code is giving 17, but sample output is 14.

Hence, the code must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the suff array.

Wait, maybe suff[i] should be sum of c[j] from j=i+1 to n-1.

In the code, suff[i] = suff[i+1] + c[i], which is sum from i to n-1.

But perhaps it should be from i+1 to n-1.

Let me adjust that.

If suff[i] = sum of c[j] from j=i+1 to n-1, then:

suff[4] = 0 + c[4]=0 (but c has length n=4, indices 0 to 3)

Wait, c is defined for j=0 to 3.

suff is defined for i=0 to 4.

suff[4] = 0

suff[3] = suff[4] + c[3]=0 + 5=5

suff[2] = suff[3] + c[2]=5 + 6=11

suff[1] = suff[2] + c[1]=11 + 3=14

suff[0] = suff[1] + c[0]=14 + 4=18

Then, for p=0: a[0]=7 + suff[1]=14 → 21

For p=1: a[1]=3 + suff[2]=11 → 14

So, minimal is 14, which matches the sample output.

Wait, earlier I thought suff[1]=18, but actually suff[1]=14.

So, for p=1: 3 + 11=14

Yes, that matches the sample output.

So, the code is correct in this case.

I must have made a mistake in earlier calculations.

Therefore, the code is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to one of the first m positions by potentially swapping places with people ahead of him.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Kirill starts at position `n+1` and wants to be among the first `m` positions.
   - He can swap with anyone ahead of him, paying certain costs.
   - We need to minimize the total cost for Kirill to reach his desired position.

2. **Insight**:
   - For each possible target position `p` (from 1 to m), calculate the cost to move directly to `p` and consider the cumulative costs of bypassing people ahead.
   - Use a suffix array to efficiently compute the sum of minimum costs required to bypass people from any position to the end of the queue.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Compute an array `c` where each element is the minimum cost between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - Build a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` represents the sum of `c[j]` for `j` from `i+1` to `n-1`.
   - For each possible target position `p` from 1 to `m`, calculate the cost as `a[p-1] + suff[p]` and find the minimum among these costs.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: Read the number of test cases `t`.
- **Step 2**: For each test case, read `n` and `m` (k in code), followed by arrays `a` and `b`.
- **Step 3**: Define `func_1` to compute the minimum cost:
  - Create array `c` where each element is the minimum of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
  - Create suffix sum array `suff` to hold the cumulative sum of `c` from position `i+1` to `n-1`.
  - Iterate through the first `m` positions, compute the cost for each, and keep track of the minimum cost.
- **Step 4**: Output the minimum cost for each test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum cost required for Kirill to reach his desired position in the queue.
