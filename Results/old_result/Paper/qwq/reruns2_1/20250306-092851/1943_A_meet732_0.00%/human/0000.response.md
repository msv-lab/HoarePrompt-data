Alright, I have this problem to solve. It involves a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to determine the final MEX of the array c after they've played optimally. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the game rules:

1. There's an array a of size n, and Alice starts with an empty array c.

2. Players take turns, with Alice going first.

3. On Alice's turn, she picks an element from a, appends it to c, and deletes it from a.

4. On Bob's turn, he picks an element from a, deletes it from a, but does not add it to c.

5. The game ends when a is empty, and the score is the MEX of c. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

So, the goal is to find out what the MEX of c will be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example:

- MEX of [0, 1, 2] is 3.

- MEX of [1, 2, 3] is 0.

- MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2.

Given that, I need to think about how Alice and Bob's actions affect the MEX of c.

Let's consider that Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which means she wants c to have as many small non-negative integers as possible, in order. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX, meaning he wants to disrupt Alice's efforts by removing elements that could help her achieve a higher MEX.

Since Alice can choose which elements to add to c, and Bob can choose which elements to remove, their choices will strategically aim to either include or exclude certain numbers to affect the final MEX.

Given that, I need to think about the frequencies of each number in the array a and how many times they can be added to c.

First observation:

- Since Bob can delete elements without adding them to c, he can prevent Alice from adding certain elements to c.

- Alice can choose to add elements to c, but Bob can interfere by deleting elements that Alice might need to achieve a higher MEX.

Let's consider the frequency of each number in a. Let's count how many times each number appears.

Let's say we have counts for each number from 0 to n (since a_i < n, but MEX can be up to n+1 in some cases).

Alice and Bob will play optimally, which means:

- Alice will try to include as many small numbers as possible in c.

- Bob will try to prevent Alice from including small numbers in c.

Since Alice goes first, and they alternate turns, Alice gets to make the first choice, and then Bob can react to her choice.

Let's think about the total number of moves:

- There are n elements, and each turn deletes one element.

- Since Alice starts, she will have ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob will have floor(n/2) turns.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

Actually, since Alice picks and adds to c, and Bob picks and just deletes, the total number of turns is n, alternating between Alice and Bob.

But actually, in each turn:

- Alice picks one element, adds it to c, and deletes it from a.

- Bob picks one element, deletes it from a, without adding to c.

So, per turn:

- Alice: +1 to c, -1 from a.

- Bob: -1 from a.

So, in total, after n turns, a is empty, and c has Alice's choices.

Wait, no. Let's think about the total number of elements added to c.

Alice adds one element to c per her turn. Bob doesn't add anything.

The total number of elements in c will be equal to the number of times Alice gets to pick.

Given that, in n elements:

- If n is even, Alice picks n/2 elements.

- If n is odd, Alice picks ceil(n/2) elements.

Wait, no. Since they alternate, and Alice starts:

- If n is even, Alice and Bob each get n/2 turns.

- If n is odd, Alice gets (n+1)/2 turns, Bob gets (n-1)/2 turns.

But in this game:

- Alice gets to choose and add to c on her turn.

- Bob gets to choose and delete from a on his turn.

Wait, no. Both delete from a, but only Alice adds to c on her turn.

So, total elements added to c are equal to the number of times Alice gets to pick.

Given that, in n elements:

- If n is even, Alice picks n/2 elements to add to c.

- If n is odd, Alice picks (n+1)/2 elements to add to c.

Wait, no. Let's think about it step by step.

Total elements to be deleted: n.

Each turn, one element is deleted.

Alice starts, then Bob, alternating.

So, number of Alice's turns: ceil(n/2).

Number of Bob's turns: floor(n/2).

So, c will have ceil(n/2) elements.

But actually, the number of elements in c is equal to the number of times Alice picks, which is ceil(n/2).

Okay, now, given that, I need to determine the MEX of c, where c has ceil(n/2) elements, chosen by Alice, with Bob interfering by deleting elements.

But Bob deletes elements without adding to c, so he can remove elements that Alice might want to include in c.

Wait, no. Bob deletes elements from a, which are not added to c.

But Alice chooses elements to add to c and deletes them from a.

Bob chooses elements to delete from a, without adding to c.

So, in terms of affecting c, Bob can delete elements from a that Alice might want to add later.

But since Alice chooses first, and they alternate, Alice can strategize to pick the elements she needs, and Bob can try to remove elements that could help Alice in the future.

This seems complex. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in a.

Let's count how many times each number appears in a.

Let's say cnt[i] is the count of number i in a, for i from 0 to n-1.

Now, since MEX is the smallest missing non-negative integer in c, I need to ensure that c contains as many small numbers as possible.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which might seem counterintuitive, but actually, she wants c to have as many small numbers as possible, so the MEX is higher.

Wait, no. To maximize the MEX, Alice wants c to have all numbers from 0 to MEX-1, and MEX not present.

So, higher MEX means c has more small numbers.

But Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from having all small numbers.

Given that, I need to find out, given that Alice can choose ceil(n/2) elements, and Bob can choose floor(n/2) elements to delete, what is the highest MEX Alice can achieve.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of availability of numbers.

Let's consider that for each number i, there are cnt[i] occurrences.

Alice wants to include as many small i as possible in c, but Bob can delete some of them.

So, for each i, the number of times it appears in c is the number of times Alice picks it, minus the number of times Bob deletes it.

Wait, no. Once an element is deleted from a, it's gone, whether by Alice or Bob.

So, for each i, the number of times it can be included in c is min(cnt[i], number of Alice's turns).

But Bob can interfere by deleting some of them.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me think about the total number of elements Alice can pick: ceil(n/2).

She wants to pick the smallest possible numbers to maximize the MEX.

But Bob will try to prevent her from picking certain numbers.

So, for each number i starting from 0, Alice wants to have at least one copy in c, to keep the MEX higher.

Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each i, if cnt[i] > 0, Alice can try to pick it, but Bob can delete it.

I need to find out, for each i, whether Alice can ensure that at least one copy of i is in c.

If she can, then i is included in c, and we check the next i.

If she can't, then i is not included in c, and MEX is i.

So, for each i from 0 to n:

- If, after considering Alice and Bob's moves, c can include i, then MEX is higher.

- Else, MEX is i.

So, I need to determine, for each i, whether Alice can ensure that at least one copy of i is in c.

Given that, let's consider the frequencies.

Let's say cnt[i] is the count of i in a.

Alice wants to include i in c, but Bob can delete some of them.

So, for each i, the number of times Alice can include i in c is cnt[i] minus the number of times Bob deletes it.

But Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements in total.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of available i after Bob's deletions.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick i, considering Bob's interference.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times i is protected by Alice from being deleted by Bob.

Wait, this seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I try to find out the minimal i that Alice cannot guarantee to include in c.

That would be the MEX.

To do that, for each i, I need to check if Alice can ensure that at least one copy of i is in c.

If she can, then MEX is higher; else, MEX is i.

So, for each i, I need to see if, even if Bob tries to prevent it, Alice can still include i in c.

Given that, perhaps I can calculate, for each i, the number of times it appears, and see if Alice can pick at least one, given Bob's deletions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of turns Alice has versus the number of times Bob can delete elements.

Let me calculate the total number of elements Alice can pick: ceil(n/2).

And the total number of elements Bob can delete: floor(n/2).

So, if I consider that Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements, and Alice picks ceil(n/2) elements.

Wait, but they alternate turns, with Alice starting.

So, in n elements:

- If n is even, Alice picks n/2 elements, Bob picks n/2 elements.

- If n is odd, Alice picks (n+1)/2 elements, Bob picks (n-1)/2 elements.

So, in total, Alice picks ceil(n/2) elements, Bob picks floor(n/2) elements.

Now, for each i, the number of times i appears in a is cnt[i].

Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements in total, but he can choose which ones to delete.

To prevent Alice from including i in c, Bob needs to delete all cnt[i] instances of i.

If cnt[i] <= floor(n/2), Bob can delete all cnt[i] instances, preventing Alice from including any i in c.

If cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then after Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements, there are still some i left for Alice to pick.

Wait, but Bob can choose which elements to delete.

So, to prevent Alice from including i, Bob would prioritize deleting i's.

Therefore, if cnt[i] <= floor(n/2), Bob can delete all i's, preventing Alice from including any i in c.

If cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least cnt[i] - floor(n/2) instances of i in c.

But Alice can only pick ceil(n/2) elements in total.

Wait, but Alice can choose which elements to pick, but Bob can interfere by deleting elements.

So, for each i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), then Alice can include at least cnt[i] - floor(n/2) instances of i in c.

But she might not need to include all of them; she just needs at least one to include i in c.

So, for each i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), Alice can include at least one in c.

Otherwise, Bob can prevent Alice from including i in c.

Therefore, the MEX would be the smallest i where cnt[i] <= floor(n/2).

Wait, but let's test this with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

4

0 0 1 1

n=4, floor(n/2)=2

cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2

For i=0: cnt[0]=2 > 2? No, 2 == 2, so Bob can delete both 0's, preventing Alice from including 0 in c. So MEX is 0.

But in the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, that contradicts my hypothesis.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the sample input 1:

4

0 0 1 1

n=4, floor(n/2)=2

cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2

According to my earlier logic, Bob can delete both 0's, preventing Alice from including 0 in c, so MEX should be 0.

But the sample output is 2, which suggests that c=[0,1], MEX=2.

So, my earlier logic is flawed.

What's wrong here?

Perhaps Bob cannot delete both 0's because Alice can pick them first.

Wait, let's think about the game progression.

Alice starts:

- Picks a 0, c=[0], a=[0,1,1]

Bob's turn:

- Deletes a 0, a=[1,1]

Alice's turn:

- Picks a 1, c=[0,1], a=[1]

Bob's turn:

- Deletes the remaining 1, a=[]

So, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

In this case, Alice managed to include both 0 and 1 in c, even though Bob deleted a 0 and a 1.

So, in this scenario, MEX is 2.

But according to my earlier logic, since cnt[0]=2 and floor(n/2)=2, Bob can delete both 0's, preventing Alice from including 0.

But in reality, Alice can pick a 0 first, adding it to c, and then Bob deletes a 0, but Alice has already included a 0 in c.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

For each i, if cnt[i] > 0, Alice can include at least one in c, unless Bob can delete all cnt[i] before Alice picks any.

But in the above case, cnt[0]=2, floor(n/2)=2, Bob can delete two elements.

But Alice picks first, so she can pick a 0 first, adding it to c, and then Bob deletes a 0.

Then Alice picks another 0 or 1, and Bob deletes another element.

So, Alice can include at least one 0 and one 1 in c.

Hence, MEX is 2.

So, perhaps my earlier condition is not accurate.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that Alice can include in c any element that appears more than floor(n/2) times in a.

Because if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), even if Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements, there are still some left for Alice to pick.

But in the sample input, cnt[0]=2 and floor(n/2)=2, so cnt[0] == floor(n/2), which is not greater.

But according to the game play, Alice can still include at least one 0.

So, perhaps the condition should be cnt[i] > floor(n/2).

But in this case, cnt[0]=2 and floor(n/2)=2, which is not greater, but Alice still included a 0.

So, perhaps the condition is cnt[i] >= floor(n/2) + 1 - something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of times Alice can pick i before Bob can delete all of them.

Let’s think about it more carefully.

Let’s define for each i:

- The number of times Alice can include i in c is max(cnt[i] - floor(n/2), 0).

Because Bob can delete up to floor(n/2) elements.

But in the sample input, cnt[0]=2, floor(n/2)=2, so max(2-2,0)=0, which suggests Alice can't include any 0, but in reality, she can include one.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to consider the sequence of picks.

Since Alice picks first, she can pick an element before Bob can delete it.

So, for each i, if cnt[i] > floor(n/2), Alice can include at least one in c.

If cnt[i] == floor(n/2), Alice can still include one if she picks it before Bob can delete all of them.

Wait, in the sample input, cnt[0]=2 and floor(n/2)=2.

Bob can delete up to 2 elements.

But Alice also picks 2 elements.

So, if Alice picks a 0 first, Bob can delete a 0, but Alice has already included one 0 in c.

Then, Alice picks another 0, Bob deletes the remaining 0, and Alice picks a 1, Bob deletes a 1.

So, Alice includes two elements: 0 and 1.

Hence, MEX is 2.

So, in this case, even though cnt[0]=2 and floor(n/2)=2, Alice can still include one 0.

Similarly, she can include one 1.

So, perhaps the general rule is that Alice can include floor(cnt[i]/2) + 1 elements of i in c.

Wait, in the sample input, floor(2/2)=1, so Alice can include 1 + 0? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(cnt[i]/2).

In the sample input, ceil(2/2)=1, which matches that Alice can include one 0.

Wait, but in this case, cnt[i] is 2, floor(n/2)=2, Alice can include ceil(cnt[i]/2)=1.

Similarly, for cnt[i]=1, ceil(1/2)=1.

But in this case, if cnt[i]=1 and floor(n/2)>=1, Bob can delete it.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps Alice can include ceil(cnt[i]/2) elements of i in c.

Because for each pair of elements, Alice can include one, as she picks first.

If cnt[i] is odd, she can include one more.

Wait, let's see.

For cnt[i]=1:

- If floor(n/2) >=1, Bob can delete it.

- So, Alice cannot include it in c.

For cnt[i]=2:

- Alice can include ceil(2/2)=1.

For cnt[i]=3:

- Alice can include ceil(3/2)=2.

And so on.

Wait, but in the sample input, cnt[0]=2, Alice includes 1, which matches ceil(2/2)=1.

Similarly, cnt[1]=2, Alice includes 1.

So, total c has one 0 and one 1.

Hence, MEX is 2.

So, perhaps the general rule is that Alice can include ceil(cnt[i]/2) elements of i in c.

Then, for each i, the number of copies in c is ceil(cnt[i]/2).

Then, to find the MEX, find the smallest i where ceil(cnt[i]/2)=0.

Wait, but in the sample input, ceil(cnt[0]/2)=1, ceil(cnt[1]/2)=1.

So, c has one 0 and one 1.

Hence, MEX is 2.

Another sample input:

2

1 1

n=2, floor(n/2)=1, ceil(n/2)=1.

cnt[0]=0, cnt[1]=2.

ceil(cnt[0]/2)=0, ceil(cnt[1]/2)=1.

So, c has no 0, one 1.

Hence, MEX is 0.

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

4

0 1 2 3

n=4, floor(n/2)=2, ceil(n/2)=2.

cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1.

ceil(1/2)=1 for each.

So, Alice can include one of each.

But she has ceil(n/2)=2 turns.

So, she can include two different numbers.

Bob can delete two others.

So, c will have two numbers, and MEX is the smallest missing one.

For example, if Alice picks 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the sample input says MEX=1 for this case.

Wait, no, in the sample input, it's:

4

0 0 1 1 -> MEX=2

4

0 1 2 3 -> MEX=1

Wait, according to my logic, Alice can include ceil(1/2)=1 for each, so c has one of each, but only two can be included since ceil(n/2)=2.

So, she picks two different numbers, say 0 and 1.

Then, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts my logic.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the second sample input:

4

0 1 2 3

n=4, floor(n/2)=2, ceil(n/2)=2.

Alice picks first: picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

Bob picks: deletes 1, a=[2,3]

Alice picks: picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

Bob picks: deletes 3, a=[]

So, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Because 1 is missing.

Hence, MEX is 1.

But according to my earlier logic, Alice can include ceil(cnt[0]/2)=1, ceil(cnt[1]/2)=1, ceil(cnt[2]/2)=1, ceil(cnt[3]/2)=1.

But she can only pick two elements.

So, she picks 0 and 2, missing 1.

Hence, MEX is 1.

So, in this case, even though she can include ceil(cnt[i]/2)=1 for each i, she can only pick two different i's.

Hence, the MEX is 1, since 1 is missing.

So, in this case, the MEX is the smallest i where the number of times it's included in c is zero.

Hence, perhaps the MEX is the smallest i where ceil(cnt[i]/2)=0 or where the number of times Alice includes i in c is zero.

Wait, but ceil(cnt[i
