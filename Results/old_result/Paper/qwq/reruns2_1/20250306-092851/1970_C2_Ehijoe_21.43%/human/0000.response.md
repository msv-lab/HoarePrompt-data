Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game on a tree where Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone from one node to another, activating nodes as they go. The game ends when a player can't make a move, and the last player to move wins. I need to figure out who wins each round if both play optimally.

First, let's understand the problem setup. There's a tree with n nodes, and the game consists of t rounds. In each round, the stone starts on a specific node, and players alternate moves until no more moves are possible. The tree is the same for all rounds, but the starting node can be different for each round.

Given that t is always 1 in this medium version, I only need to handle one round per test case. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, and the starting node for each round is provided.

Now, I need to determine the winner for each round, assuming both players play optimally. This sounds like a classic game theory problem, specifically a impartial game where the winner is determined by the number of moves available.

In such games, the concept of "Nimbers" or "grundy numbers" is often used to determine the winner. However, since the game is played on a tree, and each move activates a new node, making it unavailable for future moves, this seems similar to a game of "Nim" on a tree structure.

But let's think differently. Since the tree is a single connected component without cycles, and moves are only allowed to inactive neighbors, the game essentially traverses the tree from the starting node, activating nodes one by one until no more moves are possible.

I need to find out the total number of moves that can be made in the game, and then determine if the number of moves is odd or even. Because Ron makes the first move, if the total number of moves is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

Wait, is that correct? Let's verify.

Suppose there are 3 moves possible:

1. Ron moves from A to B

2. Hermione moves from B to C

3. Ron moves from C to D

Then, Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

If there are 2 moves:

1. Ron moves from A to B

2. Hermione moves from B to C

Then, Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

So yes, the player who makes the last move wins.

Therefore, if the total number of moves is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

Now, the problem reduces to finding the number of moves possible from a given starting node on a tree, where each move activates a previously inactive neighbor.

But wait, in the game, once a node is activated, it cannot be moved to again. So, each move must be to an unvisited neighbor.

This sounds a lot like a depth-first search (DFS), where we traverse the tree from the starting node, visiting unvisited neighbors.

In fact, the total number of moves would be equal to the number of nodes in the tree minus one, because we start from the starting node and move to all other nodes exactly once, activating them in the process.

But hold on, in a tree with n nodes, there are exactly n-1 edges. So, starting from any node, a DFS would visit all n nodes, making n-1 moves.

But according to our earlier logic, if n-1 is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

Wait, but the sample input suggests something different.

Let's look at the sample input:

5 1

1 2

1 3

3 4

3 5

1

So, the tree has 5 nodes, and the starting node is 1.

According to my earlier logic, n-1 = 4, which is even, so Hermione should win. But the sample output is "Ron", which suggests that my logic is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Let's visualize the tree:

Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.

Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.

So, the tree looks like this:

1

| \

2 3 4

|

5

Starting from node 1.

Possible moves:

Ron moves from 1 to 2.

Hermione moves from 2 to 1. Wait, but 1 is already active, so maybe not.

Wait, once a node is activated, it cannot be moved to again. So, from node 1, Ron can move to either 2 or 3.

Let's say Ron moves from 1 to 2.

Now, Hermione can move from 2 to 1, but 1 is already active, so maybe not.

Wait, the problem says: "pick an inactive neighbor". Node 1 is active, so Hermione cannot move back to 1.

Similarly, from node 2, the only neighbor is 1, which is active, so Hermione cannot make a move.

Therefore, Ron wins immediately.

But according to my earlier logic, n-1 = 4, which is even, so Hermione should win, but in this case, Ron wins.

So, my earlier logic is flawed.

Let's think differently.

Perhaps the number of moves is not n-1 in all cases, but depends on the structure of the tree and the starting node.

In the sample input, starting from node 1, Ron moves to node 2, and Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

But if Ron moves to node 3 instead, then Hermione can move from 3 to 4, then Ron moves from 4 to 5, and Hermione cannot move, so again Ron wins.

So, regardless of Ron's first move, he can force a win.

But in another tree structure, maybe Hermione can win.

I need a general way to determine the winner based on the tree structure and the starting node.

This seems like a standard impartial game, and the concept of game theory on graphs applies here.

Each connected component can be analyzed for its game value.

But since the graph is a tree, and moves are restricted to inactive neighbors, this game is similar to a game of "Nim" on the tree.

I recall that in such games, the "Nimber" or "grundy number" of a position can be calculated based on the possible moves.

The grundy number of a position is the minimum excludant (mex) of the grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.

In this game, the terminal position (no moves possible) has a grundy number of 0.

So, for a given starting node, I need to calculate its grundy number, and if it's non-zero, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

But calculating grundy numbers for each node in a tree with up to 2e5 nodes seems inefficient if done naively.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

First, observe that the tree is a acyclic graph, so we can root it and compute grundy numbers recursively.

Let's root the tree at the starting node.

Then, for each subtree, compute its grundy number based on the grundy numbers of its children.

But I need to think carefully about how the grundy numbers propagate.

Wait, perhaps I can model this game as the "Nim game on trees", where each subtree contributes to the overall grundy number.

But I need to recall how grundy numbers are calculated for such games.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of moves.

But earlier, that didn't hold for the sample input.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the number of moves available from the starting node.

In the sample input, starting from node 1, Ron can choose to move to node 2 or node 3.

If he moves to node 2, Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

If he moves to node 3, Hermione can move to node 4, then Ron moves to node 5, and Hermione cannot move, so again Ron wins.

So, Ron has a winning strategy regardless of his first move in this case.

But consider a different tree:

Say a straight line: 1-2-3-4.

If starting from node 1:

Ron moves to 2.

Hermione moves to 3.

Ron moves to 4.

Hermione cannot move.

So, Ron wins again.

Number of moves: 3, which is odd, consistent with my earlier incorrect logic.

But consider a different tree:

A star with 4 leaves: 1 connected to 2,3,4,5.

Starting from 1.

Ron can move to any of 2,3,4,5.

Say he moves to 2.

Then Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

Again, number of moves is 1, which is odd.

Wait, but if the tree is a straight line with 2 nodes: 1-2.

Starting from 1.

Ron moves to 2.

Hermione cannot move.

Ron wins.

Number of moves is 1, odd.

With 3 nodes: 1-2-3.

Starting from 1.

Ron moves to 2.

Hermione moves to 3.

Hermione wins.

Number of moves is 2, even.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Ron wins if number of moves is odd, but in this case, with 2 moves, Hermione wins.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, in the 3-node line, starting from node 1:

Ron moves to 2.

Hermione moves to 3.

No more moves, so Hermione wins.

Number of moves: 2, which is even.

Consistent with my earlier incorrect logic.

Wait, but in the sample input, n=5, starting from 1, Ron wins, and n-1=4, which is even, but according to my logic, Hermione should win, but sample output is Ron.

Contradiction.

So, my initial logic is flawed.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider the game as a selection of a path in the tree, starting from the starting node, and the player who cannot move loses.

This is similar to a game where players take turns choosing a child node that hasn't been visited yet.

This sounds like the game of "Nim" played on a tree, where each subtree corresponds to a heap, and the size of the heap is related to the number of moves available in that subtree.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the mex of the grundy numbers of the subtrees.

In impartial game theory, the grundy number of a position is the mex of the grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.

In this game, moving to an inactive neighbor corresponds to choosing a subtree and moving to its root.

Wait, maybe I need to define the grundy number for each node based on its subtrees.

Let me try to define the grundy number for a node as the mex of the grundy numbers of its subtrees.

But in standard tree games, the grundy number of a node is often the XOR of the grundy numbers of its subtrees.

Wait, perhaps in this game, the grundy number of a node is the XOR of the grundy numbers of its subtrees.

Then, if the grundy number of the starting node is non-zero, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

But I need to verify this.

In the sample input, the tree is:

1

| \

2 3 4

|

5

Let's compute the grundy numbers.

First, leaf nodes (2,4,5) have no children, so their grundy number is 0.

Node 3 has children 4 and 5, both with grundy number 0, so XOR is 0.

Node 1 has children 2 and 3, with grundy numbers 0 and 0, so XOR is 0.

But according to the sample output, Ron wins, which contradicts my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the grundy numbers.

Let me think again.

In standard Nim game on trees, the grundy number of a node is the mex of the grundy numbers of its children.

Wait, maybe that's the issue.

Let me try that.

For leaf nodes (2,4,5), since they have no children, their grundy number is 0.

Node 3 has children 4 and 5, both with grundy number 0, so the mex of {} is 0.

Node 1 has children 2,3,4, with grundy numbers 0,0,0, so the mex of {} is 0.

Again, according to this, Hermione should win, but the sample output says Ron wins.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Maybe the number of moves is not directly related to the grundy number in this way.

Let me consider the number of moves possible from the starting node.

In the sample input, starting from node 1, Ron can move to any of its neighbors: 2,3,4.

If he moves to 2, Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

If he moves to 4, Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

If he moves to 3, Hermione can move to 4, then Ron moves to 5, Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

So, regardless of Ron's first move, he can force a win.

But according to my earlier grundy number calculation, the grundy number is 0, which would suggest Hermione wins, but that contradicts the sample output.

So, perhaps my understanding of grundy numbers in this context is incorrect.

Let me try another approach.

I recall that in games where players take turns choosing moves from a set of available moves, and the game ends when no moves are left, the winner is determined by the parity of the number of moves if the game is impartial.

But in this case, the game is played on a tree, and moves are constrained by the tree structure.

Perhaps I can compute the number of moves possible from the starting node, and then see if it's odd or even.

But in the sample input, starting from node 1, the number of moves seems to be 1 (Ron moves to 2, Hermione cannot move), which is odd, so Ron wins.

But if Ron moves to 3 instead, then Hermione moves to 4, Ron moves to 5, Hermione cannot move, so 2 moves, which is even, so Hermione should win, but the sample output is Ron wins.

Wait, but in this path, Ron wins because he makes the last move.

Wait, 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, so moves: 1 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, total 3 moves, which is odd, so Ron wins.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2 moves, but actually, it's 3 moves.

Let me trace again:

Start at 1.

Ron moves to 3.

Hermione moves to 4.

Ron moves to 5.

Hermione cannot move.

Total moves: 3, which is odd, Ron wins.

Wait, in my earlier thought, I mistakenly counted only two moves, but actually, there are three moves.

So, in both possible playthroughs, the number of moves is odd, which aligns with Ron winning.

Therefore, perhaps the total number of moves is always odd in this tree, hence Ron always wins.

But I need a general way to determine this for any tree.

Wait, perhaps the number of moves is equal to the number of nodes minus one, which is n-1.

In the sample input, n=5, n-1=4, which is even, but Ron wins, which contradicts.

Wait, but in the playthroughs above, the number of moves is 1 or 3, which are odd.

Wait, maybe the number of moves is not n-1.

Wait, n-1 is the maximum number of moves possible in a tree, but in actual play, the number of moves depends on the path taken.

In the sample input, the number of moves can be 1 or 3, both odd, so Ron wins.

Perhaps in this tree, all possible play lengths are odd, so Ron wins.

But I need a way to generalize this.

Maybe I need to find the maximum number of moves and the minimum number of moves, and see if any of them are odd.

But that seems complicated.

Let me think about the game in terms of "Nimbers" again.

I recall that in impartial games, the grundy number of a position determines the winner.

If the grundy number is non-zero, the first player wins; otherwise, the second player wins.

So, perhaps I need to compute the grundy number for the starting node.

But earlier, when I tried to compute the grundy numbers based on the subtrees, I got grundy(number) = 0, which would suggest Hermione wins, but the sample says Ron wins.

So, maybe my grundy number calculation is incorrect.

Let me look up how grundy numbers are calculated for games on trees.

Upon researching, I find that in some tree games, the grundy number of a node is equal to the number of its children with grundy number 0.

But I need to verify this.

Let me try that.

In the sample input:

Leaves 2,4,5 have no children, so their grundy number is 0.

Node 3 has two children, 4 and 5, both with grundy number 0, so grundy(3) = 2 (number of children with grundy number 0).

Node 1 has three children, 2,3,4, with grundy numbers 0,2,0 respectively.

So, grundy(1) = number of children with grundy number 0, which are 2 and 4, so 2 children with grundy number 0.

Therefore, grundy(1) = 2, which is non-zero, so Ron wins.

But in the sample input, the answer is "Ron", which matches.

Let me test this with another example.

Consider a tree with 3 nodes: 1-2-3.

Starting from node 1.

Children of 1 are 2.

Grundy(2) = 0 (leaf).

Grundy(1) = number of children with grundy number 0, which is 1.

So, grundy(1) = 1, which is non-zero, so Ron wins.

But in reality, as I thought earlier, starting from 1:

Ron moves to 2.

Hermione moves to 3.

Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

This contradicts the grundy number calculation.

Therefore, this approach is incorrect.

So, perhaps the grundy number is not equal to the number of children with grundy number 0.

I need to find another way.

Let me think about the game in terms of the number of moves.

In the 3-node line, starting from 1:

Moves: 1->2, 2->3, total 2 moves, which is even, Hermione wins.

In the sample input with 5 nodes:

Possible moves: 1->2 (Ron), game ends, 1 move, which is odd, Ron wins.

Or 1->3 (Ron), 3->4 (Hermione), 4->5 (Ron), game ends, 3 moves, which is odd, Ron wins.

So, in one path, 1 move; in another, 3 moves.

Both are odd, so Ron wins.

But in the 3-node line, 2 moves, even, Hermione wins.

So, perhaps I need to find the parity of the number of moves in the game.

If the number of moves is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

But in the sample input, n=5, n-1=4, which is even, but Ron wins.

Wait, perhaps the number of moves is not n-1 in all cases.

In the sample input, one possible game has 1 move, another has 3 moves.

But n-1=4 is the maximum number of moves possible if you traverse the entire tree.

But in practice, the number of moves depends on the path taken.

So, perhaps I need to find the minimum and maximum number of moves possible from the starting node.

If both are odd, Ron wins; if both are even, Hermione wins; if one is odd and one is even, then it depends on the game.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the game as a selection of a path in the tree, starting from the starting node, and the player who cannot move loses.

This is similar to a takeaway game, where each move reduces the game state.

Wait, perhaps I can model this game as a sum of Nim heaps, where each subtree corresponds to a heap.

But I need to define the size of the heap based on the subtree.

Alternatively, perhaps the game can be modeled as a Nim game where the grundy number is the XOR of the grundy numbers of the subtrees.

Let me try that.

In the sample input:

Leaves 2,4,5 have no children, so their grundy number is 0.

Node 3 has children 4 and 5, both with grundy number 0, so grundy(3) = 0 XOR 0 = 0.

Node 1 has children 2,3,4, with grundy numbers 0,0,0, so grundy(1) = 0 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 0.

But according to the sample output, Ron wins, which contradicts, as grundy number 0 would suggest Hermione wins.

So, perhaps this is not the correct way to calculate grundy numbers.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the grundy number calculation.

I recall that in some games, the grundy number of a node is the mex of the grundy numbers of its children.

In this case:

Leaves (2,4,5): grundy = 0.

Node 3: children 4 and 5, both grundy 0, so mex({0}) = 1.

Node 1: children 2,3,4, with grundy numbers 0,1,0, so mex({0,1}) = 2.

So, grundy(1) = 2, which is non-zero, so Ron wins.

This matches the sample output.

Wait, but earlier when I applied this to the 3-node line, it didn't work.

Let me try it on the 3-node line: 1-2-3.

Node 3: leaf, grundy = 0.

Node 2: child 3, grundy = 0, so mex({0}) = 1.

Node 1: child 2, grundy = 1, so mex({1}) = 0.

So, grundy(1) = 0, which suggests Hermione wins, which matches the actual outcome.

So, perhaps the correct way to calculate grundy numbers is the mex of the grundy numbers of its children.

In the sample input:

grundy(2) = 0

grundy(4) = 0

grundy(5) = 0

grundy(3) = mex({0,0}) = 1

grundy(1) = mex({0,1,0}) = 2

Since grundy(1) = 2 != 0, Ron wins.

In the 3-node line:

grundy(3) = 0

grundy(2) = mex({0}) = 1

grundy(1) = mex({1}) = 0

Since grundy(1) = 0, Hermione wins.

This seems consistent.

Therefore, the general approach is to compute the grundy number of the starting node, and if it's non-zero, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

Now, to implement this efficiently for large trees (n up to 2e5), I need an efficient way to compute the grundy numbers.

I can perform a DFS from each node, computing the grundy number based on its children's grundy numbers.

Since n can be up to 2e5, I need to ensure that the DFS is efficient and doesn't have extra overhead.

Also, since t=1, I only need to compute this once per test case.

Now, looking at the provided code:

def func_1(nodes, start, parent=None):

if len(nodes[start]) == 1 and nodes[start][0] == parent:

return [0]

distances = []

for node in nodes[start]:

if node != parent:

distances.extend([1 + dist for dist in func_1(nodes, node, start)])

return distances

def func_2():

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())

edges = []

empty = True

nodes = defaultdict(list)

for i in range(n - 1):

(u, v) = map(int, input().split())

nodes[u].append(v)

nodes[v].append(u)

leaves = deque()

for key in nodes:

if len(nodes[key]) == 1:

leaves.append(key)

start = int(input())

moves = func_1(nodes, start)

if any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves]):

print('Ron')

else:

print('Hermione')

It seems that func_1 is trying to compute distances from the starting node, but I'm not sure how this relates to the grundy numbers.

In func_2, it reads the inputs, builds the tree adjacency list, finds the leaves, and then calls func_1 to get moves.

Then, it checks if any move has an odd distance, and if so, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

This seems similar to my earlier incorrect logic of checking the parity of the number of moves.

But according to my later reasoning, I need to compute grundy numbers using mex.

Therefore, this approach might be incorrect.

I need to modify the code to compute grundy numbers correctly.

Let me try to implement a DFS to compute grundy numbers for each node.

I can store the grundy number for each node in a dictionary.

Define a function dfs(node, parent) that returns the grundy number of the node.

grundy[node] = mex({grundy[child] for child in children if child != parent})

To compute mex, I can collect all grundy numbers of the children, sort them, and find the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

Since n can be up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to compute mex.

I can use a set to store the grundy numbers of the children and find the smallest missing integer.

But sets in Python are efficient enough for this purpose.

Once I have the grundy numbers, I can check if grundy[start] != 0; if so, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

Let me try to implement this.

But before that, let's verify with the sample input.

Sample input:

5 1

1 2

1 3

3 4

3 5

1

Tree:

1

| \

2 3 4

|

5

Compute grundy numbers:

grundy(2) = 0 (leaf)

grundy(4) = 0 (leaf)

grundy(5) = 0 (leaf)

grundy(3) = mex({0,0}) = 1

grundy(1) = mex({0,1,0}) = 2

So, grundy(1) = 2 != 0, Ron wins.

Correct.

Another test case: 3-node line: 1-2-3.

start = 1

grundy(3) = 0

grundy(2) = mex({0}) = 1

grundy(1) = mex({1}) = 0

So, grundy(1) = 0, Hermione wins.

Correct.

Therefore, this approach seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently in code.

I need to perform a DFS to compute grundy numbers for all nodes.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, I need to ensure that the DFS is efficient.

I can use a recursive DFS with memoization to store the grundy numbers.

But Python has a recursion limit, so I need to either increase the recursion limit or implement an iterative DFS.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, recursive DFS might not work due to recursion depth limits.

Therefore, I should implement an iterative DFS.

I can use a stack to simulate the DFS traversal, computing grundy numbers bottom-up.

First, I need to root the tree at the starting node.

Then, perform a post-order traversal to compute grundy numbers for each node based on their children.

But since the tree is a general tree, not necessarily rooted at the starting node, I need to choose the starting node as the root.

In the code provided, func_1 seems to be attempting to compute distances from the starting node, but I'm not sure how that relates to grundy numbers.

I need to replace func_1 with a function that computes grundy numbers.

Let me try to write a new function to compute grundy numbers iteratively.

First, perform a BFS to compute the depth of each node from the starting node and to find the leaves.

Then, process the nodes in reverse topological order, computing grundy numbers based on their children.

But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that in a tree, we can pick any node as the root and traverse accordingly.

Given time constraints, perhaps it's better to use an iterative DFS approach.

But to keep it simple, I might stick with a recursive DFS with sys.setrecursionlimit set high enough.

But I'm not sure if that's allowed in all environments.

Alternatively, I can try to implement the grundy number computation using dynamic programming in an iterative manner.

Wait, perhaps I can process the tree in post-order traversal, computing grundy numbers for each subtree as I go.

Here's an outline:

- Perform a DFS from the starting node.

- For each node, compute its grundy number as the mex of the grundy numbers of its unvisited children.

- Keep track of the parent to avoid cycles.

Implementing this recursively should work for n up to 2e5 in Python if I set the recursion limit high enough.

But I need to be careful with the recursion stack.

Let me try to implement this.

First, import sys and set recursion limit.

Then, define the DFS function to compute grundy numbers.

Use a dictionary to store the grundy number for each node.

Initialize all grundy numbers to -1 (uncomputed).

Define dfs(node, parent):

if grundy[node] != -1:

return grundy[node]

children_grundy = set()

for child in nodes[node]:

if child != parent:

children_grundy.add(dfs(child, node))

grundy[node] = mex(children_grundy)

return grundy[node]

Where mex(s) is the smallest non-negative integer not in s.

Implement mex function.

Then, compute grundy[start], and if it's non-zero, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

Print the result accordingly.

Now, implement the mex function efficiently.

Since the grundy numbers can be up to n-1, but in practice, they are smaller, I can sort the set and find the smallest missing integer.

Define mex(s):

i = 0

while i in s:

i += 1

return i

This should work efficiently for small grundy numbers.

Now, implement the DFS function as described.

Then, in func_2, build the tree, set up grundy dictionary, perform DFS from start, and determine the winner based on grundy[start].

But looking back at the provided code, it seems that func_1 is trying to compute distances from the starting node.

Maybe the idea is to compute all possible distances from the starting node and see if any of them are odd.

But as we've seen, this approach is flawed because the number of moves isn't directly related to the distances in the way assumed.

Therefore, I think the provided code is incorrect, and I need to replace func_1 with the grundy number computation.

But the problem is to determine if the given program is correct, not to write a new one.

Given that, I need to assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description.

From my analysis, the provided program seems to be incorrect because it relies on checking if any move has an odd distance, which doesn't align with the actual game mechanics.

Instead, the correct approach is to compute the grundy number of the starting node and determine the winner based on whether it's non-zero.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
