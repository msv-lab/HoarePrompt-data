Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and set the prices in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES" along with the number of stalls and their respective prices. If it's not possible, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers n and k, where n is the number of coins Alice has and k is the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy. Both n and k can be as large as 10^18, which means I have to be careful with how I handle large numbers.

Looking at the example provided:

In the first test case:

7 coins, wants to buy 3 jewels.

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Explanation:

At the first stall with price 2, Alice buys 3 jewels (since 7 // 2 = 3), leaving her with 1 coin. Since 1 is less than any other stall's price, she doesn't buy anything else. So, total jewels bought: 3.

In the third test case:

255 coins, wants to buy 8 jewels.

Output:

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Explanation:

Alice buys 1 jewel from each stall, spending 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 coins respectively, totaling 255 coins, and buying exactly 8 jewels.

From these examples, it seems that one strategy is to set up stalls with decreasing prices, where each price is a power of 2. This way, Alice buys exactly one jewel from each stall, as long as she has enough coins.

But in the first example, they used increasing prices, and Alice bought multiple jewels from the first stall.

So, there are different ways to set up the stalls to achieve the desired number of jewels.

Now, let's think about the general approach.

I need to find a way to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that when Alice buys jewels greedily, she ends up buying exactly k jewels.

First, consider the minimal number of stalls required. The minimal number of stalls would be 1, where the price is set such that the number of jewels Alice can buy is exactly k, if possible.

But in the first example, they used 10 stalls, even though it could have been done with fewer.

So, perhaps using multiple stalls allows more flexibility.

Let me consider the constraints again:

- At most 60 stalls.

- Each stall has a price between 1 and 10^18.

- Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall in order.

- She doesn't have to spend all her coins.

- We need her to buy exactly k jewels.

First, think about the minimal number of stalls needed.

If Bob sets up only one stall with price p, then Alice will buy floor(n/p) jewels.

So, to have floor(n/p) = k, p must be floor(n/k).

But wait, floor(n/p) = k implies that p = floor(n/k).

But this might not be exact, because n might not be divisible by p.

Wait, actually, if p = floor(n/k), then floor(n/p) might be greater than k.

Let me try with an example.

Suppose n=7, k=3.

floor(7/3) = 2, which is less than 3.

So, p cannot be 2, because floor(7/2) = 3, which is equal to k.

Wait, in the first example, they used multiple stalls to make sure she buys exactly 3 jewels.

So, perhaps with one stall, it's not always possible to get exactly k jewels.

In this case, with n=7, k=3, setting p=2 would make her buy 3 jewels, which is perfect.

But if n=7, k=4, is there a way to make her buy exactly 4 jewels?

If I set up two stalls with prices p1 and p2.

Suppose p1=2, p2=1.

At first stall, she buys floor(7/2)=3 jewels, left with 7-3*2=1 coin.

At second stall, she buys floor(1/1)=1 jewel.

Total jewels: 4.

So, in this case, with two stalls, it's possible to make her buy exactly 4 jewels.

Similarly, if k=7, n=7, set p=1, she buys 7 jewels.

If k=1, n=7, set p=7, she buys 1 jewel.

So, seems like with multiple stalls, it's more flexible.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, which is more than enough, probably.

But I need to find a way to determine if it's possible and provide one possible setup.

Looking at the problem, it seems that it's always possible as long as n >= k.

Because if n >= k, Bob can set up k stalls, each with price 1, and Alice will buy one jewel from each stall, totaling k jewels.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, and the maximum k is 10^18, which is way more than 60.

But since each stall can have unlimited jewels, and Alice buys as many as she can from each stall, it's not directly helpful for large k.

Wait, but with multiple stalls, she buys from each stall sequentially, spending as many coins as possible on each jewel at that stall.

So, to make her buy exactly k jewels, I need to control the number of jewels she buys from each stall.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice will buy floor(n/p1) jewels from the first stall, then floor((n - p1*floor(n/p1))/p2) from the second, and so on.

I need the sum of these to be exactly k.

This seems complicated to control directly.

Maybe there's a smarter way.

Looking back at the examples:

In the first example, with n=7, k=3, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11.

At the first stall, she buys 3 jewels (7//2=3), left with 1 coin, which is not enough for any other stall.

So, total jewels: 3.

In the third example, with n=255, k=8, they used 8 stalls with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

She buys one jewel from each stall, spending 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1 coins respectively, totaling 255 coins, and buying exactly 8 jewels.

So, in this case, it's like a binary representation.

Wait, 255 is 2^8 - 1, and the prices are powers of 2 decreasing.

This seems similar to the binary representation of the number of jewels.

Each stall corresponds to a bit in the binary representation.

But in this case, it's not directly applicable because the number of stalls can be up to 60, which is more than enough for k up to 10^18.

But perhaps there's a way to think in terms of binary representation.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as partitioning k jewels into at most 60 parts, where each part corresponds to the number of jewels bought from a stall.

But I need to map this partitioning to appropriate stall prices.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n/p1), floor(n/p2), ..., floor(n/ps) equals k.

But this is difficult to control directly.

An alternative idea is to set up stalls in such a way that Alice buys a specific number of jewels from each stall.

For example, if I set up s stalls and specify that she should buy k1, k2, ..., ks jewels from each stall, respectively, with k1 + k2 + ... + ks = k.

Then, for each stall i, I need to set pi such that floor(n/pi) = ki.

Given that, pi should satisfy n/pi >= ki and n/pi < ki + 1.

Which means pi <= floor(n/ki) and pi > ceil(n/(ki + 1)).

Wait, let's think carefully.

If floor(n/pi) = ki, then:

ki <= n/pi < ki + 1

Which implies:

n/(ki + 1) < pi <= n/ki

So, pi should be in (n/(ki + 1), n/ki].

But pi has to be an integer, so pi = ceil(n/(ki + 1)) + 1 to floor(n/ki).

Wait, more precisely, pi should be in the range ceil(n/(ki + 1)) to floor(n/ki).

But we need to ensure that floor(n/pi) = ki.

Let me verify with an example.

Take n=7, k=3.

Suppose I want to set up one stall with pi such that floor(7/pi)=3.

So, 3 <= 7/pi < 4

Which means 7/4 < pi <= 7/3

So, 1.75 < pi <= 2.333...

Since pi is integer, pi=2.

Indeed, floor(7/2)=3.

Another example: n=7, k=4.

If I set up two stalls:

First stall: buy k1 jewels.

Second stall: buy k2 jewels, with k1 + k2 = 4.

Choose k1=3, k2=1.

For first stall: floor(n/p1)=3.

So, 3 <= 7/p1 < 4 => p1 in (1.75, 2.333], so p1=2.

After buying 3 jewels, n -= 3*2 = 6, so n=1.

Second stall: floor(1/p2)=1 => 1 <= 1/p2 < 2 => p2=1.

So, p1=2, p2=1.

This works.

Similarly, for n=255, k=8, with p1=128, p2=64, p3=32, p4=16, p5=8, p6=4, p7=2, p8=1.

Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

So, in this case, each pi is chosen such that floor(n/pi)=1.

Which means n/pi >=1 and n/pi <2, so pi in (n/2, n].

But in practice, they chose pi as powers of 2 decreasing.

Which works because n is 255, which is 2^8 -1, and the prices are 2^7,2^6,...,2^0.

So, n/pi = 255/128 = 1.984, floor is 1.

Then n -=1*128=127.

Next, 127/64=1.984, floor=1.

And so on, until n=1, buy 1 jewel from p8=1, n=0.

So, this works.

So, one possible strategy is to set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, starting from the highest possible that is less than or equal to n, down to 1.

This way, Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling the number of stalls.

So, if k <=60, and n >=k, we can set up k stalls with prices that are powers of 2, and Alice will buy one from each, totaling k.

But in the first example, k=3, n=7, they used 10 stalls, which is more than k.

So, perhaps using more stalls than k is allowed, but the minimal number of stalls is not necessarily k.

Wait, but in the third example, k=8, they used 8 stalls.

So, perhaps using exactly k stalls is possible, but they chose to use more in the first example.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so as long as s <=60, it's acceptable.

So, a general strategy could be:

- If k <=60 and n >=k, output "YES", set up k stalls with prices that are powers of 2, decreasing, starting from 2^{floor(log2(n))} down to 1.

- If k >60 or n <k, output "NO".

But wait, in the first example, k=3, n=7, they used 10 stalls.

But according to this strategy, I could use 3 stalls with prices 4,2,1.

At first stall, buy 1 jewel (7//4=1), n=3.

Second stall, buy 1 jewel (3//2=1), n=1.

Third stall, buy 1 jewel (1//1=1), n=0.

Total jewels:3.

Alternatively, use one stall with p=2, buy 3 jewels, n=1 left.

Which also gives k=3.

But in the example, they used 10 stalls.

So, perhaps multiple solutions exist.

But the problem allows any valid setup with s <=60.

So, in the first case, using s=3 is sufficient.

But they used s=10.

So, perhaps their solution is to use s=ceil(n) stalls with prices increasing.

Wait, in their solution, they used prices from 2 to 11, which are 10 prices.

But in my approach, using s=3 with prices 4,2,1 also works.

So, both are valid.

Hence, multiple solutions exist.

So, in general, if k <=60 and n >=k, output "YES" and provide any valid setup.

If k >60 or n <k, output "NO".

But wait, k can be up to 10^18, and s is at most 60.

So, if k >60, but n >=k, is it still possible?

Wait, the problem says "at most 60 stalls".

So, s <=60.

But k can be up to 10^18, which is way larger than 60.

So, if k >60, it's impossible to set up s <=60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Because from each stall, she can buy multiple jewels, but the total number of jewels bought is sum over floor(n/pi) for each stall i.

But if s <=60, and each floor(n/pi) <=n, then the total number of jewels is at most s*n, which is 60*n.

But k can be up to 10^18, which is larger than 60*n for n up to 10^18.

Wait, no, 60*n can be up to 60*10^18=6*10^19, which is larger than 10^18.

But perhaps for some n and k, it's not possible with s <=60.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that s <=60, and I need to set up s stalls with prices p1,p2,...,ps.

Alice will buy floor(n/p1) + floor(n/p2) + ... + floor(n/ps) = k.

I need to choose s <=60, p1,p2,...,ps such that this sum equals k.

Given that n and k can be up to 10^18, and s <=60.

I need to find a way to control the sum of floor(n/pi) to equal k.

This seems tricky.

An alternative approach is to fix s=60, and try to find prices p1,p2,...,p60 such that sum of floor(n/pi)=k.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps a better way is to consider that with s=60, I can set up stalls with prices that allow me to control the number of jewels bought from each stall.

Wait, perhaps I can set up stalls with decreasing prices, similar to the binary representation.

For example, set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, starting from 2^b down to 2^0, where b is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n.

Then, Alice will buy one jewel from each stall, as in the third example.

In that case, s would be floor(log2(n)) +1.

For n=255, s=8.

But in the first example, s=10 for n=7, k=3.

Wait, 7 in binary is 111, which is 3 jewels, but they used s=10.

So, perhaps their approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up s=60 stalls with prices that allow me to buy exactly one jewel from each stall, up to s=60.

But k can be up to 10^18, which is much larger than 60.

Wait, but s is at most 60.

So, if k >60, it's impossible to set up s <=60 stalls such that sum of floor(n/pi)=k, because sum of floor(n/pi) <= s*floor(n/pi_min), but pi_min >=1, so floor(n/pi_min) <=n.

So, sum <= s*n <=60*n.

But k can be up to 10^18, which is larger than 60*n for n up to 10^18.

Wait, no, 60*n can be up to 6*10^19, which is larger than 10^18.

But for certain n and k, it might not be possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for s=60, I can set up stalls with prices such that Alice buys a certain number of jewels from each stall, totaling k.

But it's still too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set up s=1 stall.

Then, floor(n/p)=k, which requires p to be in (n/(k+1), n/k].

If such p exists, then it's possible.

If s=1, and k <=n < p*(k+1), then p = ceil(n/(k+1)) +1 to floor(n/k).

But p has to be integer, and within 1 to 10^18.

So, for s=1, it's possible only if there exists p such that floor(n/p)=k.

Which is possible only if n >=k and n < p*(k+1).

Wait, more precisely:

floor(n/p)=k implies:

k <= n/p < k+1

Which implies:

n/(k+1) < p <= n/k

So, p must be in (n/(k+1), n/k].

If n and k are such that n/k - n/(k+1) >=1, then there exists integer p in that range.

Otherwise, it's impossible with s=1.

But the problem allows up to s=60 stalls.

So, perhaps with multiple stalls, it's possible to cover a wider range.

But it's getting complicated.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the key is to note that with s stalls, each with price p_i, the total number of jewels bought is sum of floor(n/p_i).

I need to make this sum equal to k.

Given that s <=60, and p_i can be up to 10^18.

One possible approach is to set up s stalls with decreasing prices, similar to the binary representation, where each stall corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of k.

But k can be up to 10^18, which has up to 60 bits, which coincides with the maximum number of stalls allowed.

Wait, 10^18 in binary has up to 60 bits, since 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e18, which is greater than 10^18.

So, with s=60 stalls, each with prices corresponding to powers of 2, from 2^59 down to 2^0, I can make Alice buy exactly k jewels by setting up stalls accordingly.

Wait, in the third example, they used s=8 stalls with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, which are powers of 2, and Alice bought one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

Similarly, if k=10, I could set up s=10 stalls with prices 2^9,2^8,...,2^0, and Alice would buy one from each, totaling 10 jewels.

But in this case, k=10, which is less than 60, so s=10 <=60.

But if k=10^18, which is 1000000000000000000, which is 2^60, I would need s=60 stalls.

But in reality, 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e18, which is larger than 10^18.

Wait, 10^18 in binary has 60 bits, as 2^59 is approximately 5.76e17, and 2^60 is approximately 1.152e18.

So, 10^18 is between 2^59 and 2^60.

So, with s=60 stalls, each with prices 2^59 down to 2^0, Alice would buy one jewel from each stall, totaling s=60 jewels.

But if k=10^18, which is much larger than 60, this approach wouldn't work.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the binary representation approach, setting up s=60 stalls with prices 2^59 down to 2^0, Alice would buy one jewel from each stall, totaling s=60 jewels.

But if k=10^18, which is much larger than 60, this approach wouldn't help.

So, perhaps the binary representation approach is only useful for k up to 60.

But in the problem, k can be up to 10^18.

So, I need a different strategy.

Let me consider that with s=2 stalls, I can control the number of jewels bought from each stall.

Suppose I set p1 and p2.

Then, floor(n/p1) + floor(n/p2) =k.

This is still difficult to control.

An alternative idea is to set up one stall with p1 such that floor(n/p1)=k1, and then set up remaining stalls to make up k - k1 jewels.

But this seems recursive and may not be efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can set up one stall with p1 such that floor(n/p1)=k1, where k1 <=k, and then set up remaining s-1 stalls to make up k - k1 jewels with the remaining n - k1*p1 coins.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I set up s=1 stall with p1=n/k.

Then, floor(n/p1)=k.

But p1 must be an integer in [1,10^18].

So, if n/k is integer, then p1=n/k works.

If not, p1=ceil(n/k).

But wait, ceil(n/k) is equal to (n+k-1)//k in integer division.

Then, floor(n/ceil(n/k)) <=k.

But I need floor(n/p1)=k.

So, p1 must satisfy n/(k+1) < p1 <=n/k.

If n/k - n/(k+1) >=1, then there exists integer p1 in that range.

Otherwise, no.

Wait, more precisely:

floor(n/p1)=k implies:

k <= n/p1 <k+1

Which implies:

n/(k+1) < p1 <=n/k

So, p1 must be in (n/(k+1), n/k]

If n/k - n/(k+1) >=1, then there exists integer p1 in that range.

Otherwise, no.

So, for s=1, it's possible only if n/k - n/(k+1) >=1.

Otherwise, need s>=2.

But n/k - n/(k+1) = n*(1/k -1/(k+1)) = n/(k(k+1))

So, n/(k(k+1)) >=1 implies n >=k(k+1).

So, if n >=k(k+1), then s=1 is possible.

Otherwise, s>=2 is needed.

But in the first example, n=7, k=3.

7 >=3*4=12 is false, so s=1 is not possible.

Hence, need s>=2.

In the first example, they used s=10.

Similarly, in the second test case, n=6, k=4.

6 >=4*5=20 is false, so s>=2 is needed.

But in the sample input, it's "NO".

Wait, why is it "NO"?

Wait, perhaps there are cases where even with s<=60, it's impossible.

Wait, for n=6, k=4.

From above, s=1 is not possible since 6 <4*5=20.

Try s=2.

Set p1 and p2.

Need floor(6/p1) + floor(6/p2)=4.

Let's try p1=2, p2=1.

Floor(6/2)=3, floor(6/1)=6.

Total:9, which is more than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=3, p2=1.

Floor(6/3)=2, floor(6/1)=6.

Total:8, still more than 4.

Try p1=4, p2=1.

Floor(6/4)=1, floor(6/1)=6.

Total:7, still more than 4.

Try p1=5, p2=1.

Floor(6/5)=1, floor(6/1)=6.

Total:7, still more.

Try p1=2, p2=2.

Floor(6/2)=3, floor(4/2)=2.

Wait, no.

Wait, after buying from p1=2, she buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

Then, can't buy from p2.

Total jewels:3, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=3, p2=2.

Floor(6/3)=2, spends 6 coins, left with 0.

Can't buy from p2.

Total:2, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=1, p2=2.

Floor(6/1)=6, which is more than 4.

Not good.

Try p1=1, p2= floor((6-1)/ (4-1))=floor(5/3)=1.

But p2 can't be less than or equal to p1.

Wait, Alice buys from p1 first, as many as possible.

So, if p1=1, she buys 6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

Not good.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible for n=6, k=4 with s<=60.

Hence, "NO".

So, in this case, even with multiple stalls, it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly k=4 jewels with n=6 coins.

Hence, the output is "NO".

So, there are cases where it's impossible.

Hence, the condition n >=k(k+1)/2 seems relevant.

Wait, for s=1, it's n >=k(k+1).

Wait, no.

Wait, in the first test case, n=7, k=3.

7 >=3*4/2=6, which is true.

And they used s=10.

In the second test case, n=6, k=4.

6 >=4*5/2=10 is false.

Hence, "NO".

In the third test case, n=255, k=8.

255 >=8*9/2=36, which is true.

Hence, "YES".

So, perhaps the condition is n >=k*(k+1)/2.

Which is the sum of the first k natural numbers.

If n >=k*(k+1)/2, then it's possible with s<=k.

But in the problem, s<=60.

But k can be up to 10^18.

But in the sample input, for k=4, n=6, which is less than 10, it's "NO".

Hence, perhaps n >=k*(k+1)/2 is a necessary condition.

But in the first test case, n=7, k=3, 7 >=3*4/2=6, which is true.

Hence, "YES".

In the second test case, n=6, k=4, 6 <4*5/2=10, hence "NO".

In the third test case, n=255, k=8, 255 >=8*9/2=36, which is true.

Hence, "YES".

So, perhaps the condition is n >=k*(k+1)/2.

Which is equivalent to n >= sum of first k natural numbers.

If n >=k*(k+1)/2, then it's possible to set up s<=k stalls with prices that make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

But in the first test case, they used s=10, which is more than k=3, but it's allowed since s<=60.

But according to this condition, s<=k would suffice.

Hence, perhaps s=k is sufficient.

In the third test case, they used s=8, which is equal to k=8.

Hence, it seems that s=k is sufficient when n >=k*(k+1)/2.

But in the first test case, k=3, n=7 >=6, which is true.

Hence, s=3 would suffice.

But in the sample input, they used s=10.

So, multiple solutions exist.

Hence, a general approach could be:

- If n >=k*(k+1)/2 and k <=60, output "YES" and provide a setup with s=k stalls, each with price p_i = ceil(n / (k - sum of floor(n / p_j) for j <i )).

But this seems too vague.

An easier approach is to set up s=k stalls with prices p_i = ceil(n / (k - i +1)) for i from 1 to k.

But need to ensure that p_i are integers and within the range [1,10^18].

But this seems complicated.

Looking back, perhaps the condition is simply n >=k and k <=60.

But in the second test case, n=6, k=4, which is n >=k, but it's "NO".

Hence, that can't be the condition.

Wait, perhaps the condition is n >=k and n >=k*(k+1)/2.

But in the first test case, n=7, k=3, 7 >=3 and 7 >=3*4/2=6, which is true.

In the second test case, n=6, k=4, 6 >=4 is true, but 6 <4*5/2=10, which is false.

Hence, "NO".

In the third test case, n=255, k=8, 255 >=8 and 255 >=8*9/2=36, which is true.

Hence, "YES".

So, the condition seems to be n >=k*(k+1)/2.

Because sum of the first k natural numbers is k*(k+1)/2.

And in the greedy approach, if n >=k*(k+1)/2, we can set up s=k stalls with prices p_i = i, and Alice will buy 1 jewel from each stall, totaling k jewels.

But in reality, with p_i =i, Alice may buy more than one jewel from some stalls.

Wait, no.

Wait, if p_i =i, then floor(n/p_i) = floor(n/i).

If n=7, k=3, sum of floor(7/1)+floor(7/2)+floor(7/3)=7+3+2=12, which is more than k=3.

So, this doesn't help.

Hence, perhaps setting p_i = ceil(n / (k - sum of floor(n / p_j) for j <i )).

But this seems too involved.

An alternative idea is to set up s=k stalls with prices p_i = ceil(n / k).

Then, floor(n/p_i)= floor(n / ceil(n/k)).

But ceil(n/k) can be either floor(n/k) or floor(n/k)+1.

So, floor(n / ceil(n/k)) could be floor(n / floor(n/k)) or floor(n / (floor(n/k)+1)).

Need to calculate this carefully.

But this seems too complicated.

Looking back, perhaps the condition is n >=k*(k+1)/2, and s=k.

Then, set p_i = floor(n /i).

But again, need to verify.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a minimal n required to buy k jewels.

Suppose Alice buys one jewel from each of the k stalls.

Then, the minimal n required is sum of p_i for i from 1 to k.

If p_i =i, then sum is k*(k+1)/2.

Hence, n needs to be at least k*(k+1)/2.

If n >=k*(k+1)/2, then it's possible to set up s=k stalls with prices p_i =i, and Alice will buy one jewel from each stall, totaling k jewels.

If n <k*(k+1)/2, it's impossible.

Hence, the condition is n >=k*(k+1)/2.

But in the first test case, n=7, k=3, 7 >=3*4/2=6, which is true.

In the second test case, n=6, k=4, 6 <4*5/2=10, which is false.

In the third test case, n=255, k=8, 255 >=8*9/2=36, which is true.

Hence, the output corresponds to "YES", "NO", "YES".

Which matches the sample output.

Hence, the condition is n >=k*(k+1)/2.

Moreover, since s<=60, and k<=60, it's acceptable.

But in the problem, k can be up to 10^18, but s<=60.

Hence, if k<=60 and n >=k*(k+1)/2, output "YES" and provide a setup with s=k stalls, each with p_i =i.

Otherwise, "NO".

But in the first test case, k=3, n=7 >=6, "YES".

In the second test case, k=4, n=6 <10, "NO".

In the third test case, k=8, n=255 >=36, "YES".

Hence, this seems to be the correct condition.

Hence, in code, for each test case, check if k <=60 and n >=k*(k+1)/2.

If yes, output "YES", s=k, and p_i =i for i from 1 to k.

Otherwise, "NO".

But in the first test case, they used s=10, which is more than k=3.

But according to this, s=k=3 would suffice.

Hence, multiple solutions exist.

Hence, in code, I can set s=k, p_i=i for i from 1 to k.

But in reality, in the first test case, they used s=10, which also works.

Hence, any s >=k and s<=60 is acceptable, as long as n >=sum of p_i for i from 1 to s.

But in this approach, setting p_i=i for i from 1 to k ensures that sum p_i =k*(k+1)/2, and n >=k*(k+1)/2.

Hence, it's valid.

Hence, in code, for each test case:

- Read n and k.

- If k >60 or n <k*(k+1)/2, output "NO".

- Else, output "YES", s=k, and p_i=i for i from 1 to k.

But in the first test case, they used s=10, which is more than k=3.

Hence, perhaps to minimize s, set s=k.

But since s<=60, and k<=60, it's acceptable.

Hence, this should work.

But need to make sure that with p_i=i, Alice buys exactly one jewel from each stall.

Wait, in the first test case, with k=3, s=3, p1=1, p2=2, p3=3.

Then, Alice buys floor(7/1)=7 jewels from p1, which is more than k=3.

Hence, this doesn't work.

Wait, this is a problem.

Hence, my previous assumption is incorrect.

Hence, setting p_i=i for i from 1 to k doesn't work, because Alice may buy more jewels from the cheaper stalls.

Hence, need a different approach.

Alternative idea:

Set p_i = n - sum of p_j for j <i +1.

But this seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps set p1 =n - (k -1), p2=1, p3=1, ..., ps=1.

Then, floor(n/p1)=1, floor((n - p1)/p2)=1, and so on, up to k times.

But need to ensure that p1 <=n - (k-1).

Wait, this seems messy.

An alternative idea is to set p1 =n - (k -1), p2=1, p3=1, ..., pk=1.

Then, Alice buys 1 jewel from p1, spending p1 coins, leaving n - p1 >=k-1 coins.

Then, from p2, buys floor((n - p1)/p2)=n - p1 >=k-1, p2=1, so floor((n - p1)/1)>=k-1.

But I need her to buy only 1 jewel from each stall, totaling k jewels.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps set p1 =n - (k -1)*p2.

But this is getting too complicated.

Looking back, perhaps the initial condition is not sufficient.

Wait, perhaps the condition is n >=k and n -k*(k+1)/2 >=0.

Wait, no, that's the same as n >=k*(k+1)/2.

But in the first test case, n=7, k=3, 7 >=3*4/2=6, which holds.

In the second test case, n=6, k=4, 6 <4*5/2=10, which doesn't hold.

In the third test case, n=255, k=8, 255 >=8*9/2=36, which holds.

Hence, the condition seems correct.

But in the first test case, with p1=2,
