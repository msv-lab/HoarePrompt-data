Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly equal to a given number X. X can be anywhere from 2 up to 1e18, and I have to do this for multiple test cases, up to 1000 of them.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence obtained by removing some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing. Also, even if two subsequences have the same values but are from different positions in the array, they are considered different.

So, for example, if I have an array like [1, 2, 3], the increasing subsequences would include empty subsequence, [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], and [1,2,3]. That's a total of 8 subsequences, which is 2^3.

Wait a minute, 2^3 is 8, which is exactly the number of subsequences for an array of length 3. Is that a pattern? Let's think about it.

For an array of length N, the total number of subsequences is 2^N, including the empty subsequence. But in this problem, we're only interested in increasing subsequences. So, it's not just any subsequence, but only those that are strictly increasing.

However, in the example given in the problem, for X=2, the array is [0], which has two increasing subsequences: empty and [0]. For X=5, the array is [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences: empty, [0], [1], [0,1], and [0] (from the first and third positions).

Hmm, so it's not just 2^N. It's something more specific.

I need to find an array where the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X. Given that X can be up to 1e18, which is a very large number, the array can have up to 200 elements, which makes sense because 2^200 is way larger than 1e18.

But generating all possible subsequences for an array of 200 elements is not feasible directly due to time and space constraints. So, I need a smarter way to construct such an array.

Let me think about how the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated.

One way to think about it is to consider each element and see how it can extend existing increasing subsequences.

Wait, dynamic programming comes to mind. If I have an array A, I can define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending at position i.

Then, dp[i] = 1 (just the element itself) plus the sum of dp[j] for all j < i where A[j] < A[i].

Total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of dp[i] for all i, plus 1 for the empty subsequence.

But calculating this for an array of 200 elements is feasible, but I need to construct the array such that this sum is exactly X.

This seems tricky. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider constructing an array that is non-decreasing. In that case, every subsequence would be increasing, so the number of increasing subsequences would be 2^N - 1 (excluding the empty subsequence). But the problem includes the empty subsequence as well, so it would be 2^N.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says that an empty subsequence is also considered increasing, so for a non-decreasing array, the number of increasing subsequences would be 2^N.

But 2^N grows exponentially, and X can be up to 1e18, which is 2^60. So, for N=60, 2^60 is 1e18. But our array can have up to 200 elements, which is way more than enough.

But the problem is that for some X, it might not be possible to have exactly X increasing subsequences with an array of at most 200 elements.

I need to find, for a given X, the smallest N such that there exists an array of length N with exactly X increasing subsequences.

But the problem allows N up to 200, so I need to make sure that for the given X, such an N exists and is <=200.

But checking all possible arrays of size up to 200 is impossible due to time constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about binary representations.

Since 2^N is the number of subsequences for a non-decreasing array, maybe I can represent X in binary and construct the array accordingly.

Wait, but X can be up to 1e18, which is 60 bits. But our N can be up to 200, which is more than enough.

But I need to make sure that the array I construct has exactly X increasing subsequences.

Let me consider that any array can be constructed in such a way that it has a specific number of increasing subsequences.

I need to find a way to construct such an array.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

For X=2:

Output:

1

0

So, array [0] has 2 increasing subsequences: empty and [0].

For X=5:

Output:

3

0 1 0

Let's see the increasing subsequences for [0,1,0]:

- Empty

- [0] (first element)

- [1]

- [0,1]

- [0] (third element)

Total: 5.

Similarly, for X=13:

Output:

5

2 2 3 4 2

Let's list the increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [2] (first)

- [2] (second)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2,3]

- [2,4]

- [3,4]

- [2,3,4]

- [2] (fifth)

- [2,4] (first and fifth)

- [2,4] (second and fifth)

- [2] (first)

- [2] (second)

- [2] (fifth)

Wait, some of these might be duplicates, but according to the problem, subsequences are considered different if they correspond to different positions, even if the values are the same.

So, for [2,2,3,4,2], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [2] (first position)

- [2] (second position)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2] (fifth position)

- [2,3] (first and third positions)

- [2,4] (first and fourth positions)

- [2,3] (second and third positions)

- [2,4] (second and fourth positions)

- [3,4]

- [2,3,4] (second, third, fourth positions)

- [2,3,4] (first, third, fourth positions)

Total: 13.

Yes, that matches.

Similarly, for X=37:

Output:

7

-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1

I can list the increasing subsequences, but that would take time. Assuming it's correct.

So, the approach seems to be building an array in a specific way to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's try to understand what it's doing.

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads X and calls func_1(n-1, result), where n is X.

Wait, why n-1? Because X includes the empty subsequence, and perhaps the function is designed to calculate for non-empty subsequences.

But in the problem statement, X includes the empty subsequence, so total increasing subsequences should be X, including the empty one.

Wait, in the sample input for X=2, the array has one element, and the subsequences are empty and [0], which is 2, matching X.

Similarly, for X=5, the array has three elements with 5 increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

So, perhaps the function is designed to handle X including the empty subsequence.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(number: int, sequence: List[int]) -> int:

This function seems to generate a sequence based on the input number.

It first checks if number is 0, in which case it returns 0.

Then, it finds the largest size such that (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number.

Wait, (1 << size + 1) is 2^(size + 1), so 2^(size + 1) - 1 is the maximum number of increasing subsequences for an array of size 'size'.

Wait, 2^size would be the number of subsequences for a non-decreasing array, including empty.

But in the function, it's (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number.

Wait, 1 << size + 1 is equal to 1 << (size + 1), which is 2^(size + 1).

So, 2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number.

But that seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 <= number.

But in Python, << has higher precedence than +, so 1 << size + 1 is equivalent to (1 << size) + 1.

Wait, no, precedence of bitwise shift is higher than addition.

So, 1 << size + 1 is equivalent to (1 << size) + 1.

But in Python, the bitwise shift operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.

So, 1 << size + 1 is equivalent to (1 << size) + 1.

But in the function, it's written as (1 << size + 1) - 1, which would be (1 << size) + 1 - 1 = 1 << size.

Wait, that can't be right.

Looking back at the code:

while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:

But as per Python's operator precedence, << has higher precedence than +, so it's equivalent to (1 << size) + 1 - 1 <= number, which simplifies to (1 << size) <= number.

So, it's while (1 << size) <= number: size += 1

Then, it appends size elements to the sequence, each initialized to their index: 0,1,2,...,size-1.

Then, it calls func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence), and then adjusts the sequence based on the result.

This seems like it's building the sequence recursively, similar to building a binary representation of the number.

Wait, but it's not exactly binary, because 1 << size is 2^size, and (1 << size) - 1 is 2^size - 1.

But in the code, it's (1 << size + 1) - 1, which is (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 = 2^(size + 1) - 1.

But due to operator precedence, it's actually (1 << size) + 1 - 1, which is just 1 << size.

So, the while loop is effectively:

while (1 << size) <= number:

size += 1

Then, it appends size elements to the sequence: 0,1,2,...,size-1.

Then, it calls func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence).

Wait, number - (1 << size) + 1.

Given that (1 << size) is greater than or equal to number, number - (1 << size) + 1 could be negative.

Wait, no, it's number - ((1 << size) - 1), which would be number - (2^size - 1).

But in the code, it's number - (1 << size) + 1, which is number - (2^size) + 1.

This seems confusing.

Maybe I misread it.

Looking back:

number - (1 << size) + 1

Which is number - (2^size) + 1

But if the while loop stops when (1 << size) > number, then 1 << (size-1) <= number < 1 << size.

So, 1 << size is greater than number.

But in the code, it's while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:

But as discussed, (1 << size + 1) - 1 is 1 << size.

Wait, no, (1 << size + 1) - 1 is (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 = 2^(size + 1) - 1.

But due to operator precedence, it's (1 << size) + 1 - 1 = 1 << size.

So, the while loop is:

while (1 << size) <= number:

size += 1

Then, outside the loop, size is the smallest integer such that 1 << size > number.

But in the loop, it appends size elements to the sequence: 0,1,2,...,size-1.

Then, it calls func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence).

Wait, number - (1 << size) + 1.

Given that 1 << size > number, this could be negative.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at it differently.

Maybe the function is designed to handle number as the desired number of increasing subsequences minus one, hence n-1 in the main function.

Wait, in the main function, it's func_1(n - 1, result).

So, X is n, and func_1 is called with n-1.

So, perhaps the function is designed to create an array with exactly number + 1 increasing subsequences.

Because if number = X - 1, then number + 1 = X.

But I need to verify this.

Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to handle number including the empty subsequence, but I'm not sure.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

I recall that in an array where each element is smaller than the next, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^N, including the empty one.

If there are duplicates or the array is not strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences would be less than 2^N.

So, for example, if I have an array like [1,2,3], it has 8 increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

If I have [1,2,2], it has 7 increasing subsequences: empty, [1], [2], [2], [1,2], [1,2], [2,2].

Wait, but according to the problem, subsequences are different if they come from different positions, so [2] from the second position and [2] from the third position are considered different.

So, for [1,2,2], it should have:

- Empty

- [1]

- [2] (first 2)

- [2] (second 2)

- [1,2] (1 and first 2)

- [1,2] (1 and second 2)

- [2,2] (first and second 2), but this is not strictly increasing, so it's invalid.

Wait, [2,2] is not strictly increasing, so it's not counted.

So, total of 5 increasing subsequences.

But according to the earlier sample input for X=5, the array is [0,1,0], which also has 5 increasing subsequences.

So, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Wait, in [1,2,2], number of increasing subsequences is 5, which matches X=5.

But in the sample input for X=5, the array is [0,1,0].

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let's list the increasing subsequences for [1,2,2]:

- Empty

- [1]

- [2] (first)

- [2] (second)

- [1,2] (1 and first 2)

- [1,2] (1 and second 2)

Total: 5.

Similarly, for [0,1,0]:

- Empty

- [0] (first)

- [1]

- [0,1]

- [0] (second)

Total: 5.

So, both arrays have 5 increasing subsequences.

Hence, for X=5, either [1,2,2] or [0,1,0] would work.

So, perhaps there's flexibility in constructing the array.

Now, going back to the provided program, it seems to be constructing the array in a specific way to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

But I'm still not entirely sure how the function func_1 is working.

Let me try to trace it for X=5.

So, n=5, func_1(4, result).

In func_1, number=4.

size starts at 1.

while (1 << 1 + 1) - 1 = (1 << 1) + 1 - 1 = 1 + 1 -1 =1 <=4: size=2

while (1 << 2 +1)-1=(1<<2)+1-1=4+1-1=4<=4: size=3

while (1<<3 +1)-1=(1<<3)+1-1=8+1-1=8>4: stop

So, size=3-1=2?

Wait, no, size is incremented until (1<<size +1)-1 > number.

Wait, in code, it's while (1 << size + 1) -1 <= number: size +=1

Which is while (1<<size)+1-1=(1<<size)<=number: size +=1

So, for number=4:

size=1: 1<<1=1 <=4: size=2

size=2:1<<2=2 <=4: size=3

size=3:1<<3=4 <=4: size=4

size=4:1<<4=8 >4: stop

So, size=4-1=3?

Wait, no, in the code, size is incremented in the loop, and the loop stops when (1<<size +1)-1 > number.

But in the code, it's:

while (1 << size + 1) -1 <= number:

size +=1

So, size starts at 1.

(1<<1 +1)-1=(1<<1)+1-1=1+1-1=1 <=4: size=2

(1<<2 +1)-1=(1<<2)+1-1=4+1-1=4 <=4: size=3

(1<<3 +1)-1=(1<<3)+1-1=8+1-1=8 >4: stop

So, size=3

Then, append 0,1,2 to result.

Then, call func_1(4 - (1<<3)+1=4-8+1=-3, result)

Wait, number - (1<<size)+1 =4-8+1=-3

So, func_1(-3, result)

But func_1 has assertion number >=0, so it will fail.

Wait, that can't be right.

Looking back at the code:

def func_1(number: int, sequence: List[int]) -> int:

assert number >= 0

if number == 0:

return 0

size =1

while (1 << size +1)-1 <= number:

size +=1

for i in range(size):

sequence.append(i)

result = func_1(number - (1 << size)+1, sequence)

for i in range(size):

assert -len(sequence) <= -result -i -1 <= -1

sequence[-result -i -1] += result

return size + result

So, in this case, number=4, size=3

append 0,1,2 to sequence

then call func_1(4 - (1<<3)+1=4-8+1=-3, sequence)

But number=-3, which violates the assertion number >=0

So, there's an error in the logic.

Wait, perhaps I misread the expression.

number - (1 << size) +1

Which is 4 - 8 +1 = -3

But the assertion is number >=0, which is violated.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the function.

Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to handle negative numbers, but there's an assertion to prevent that.

So, perhaps the function is not correctly implemented.

Alternatively, maybe the expression is number - ((1 << size)-1)

Because (1 << size) -1 is 2^size -1

So, number - (2^size -1)

In the code, it's number - (1 << size) +1, which is number - (2^size) +1

But perhaps it should be number - ((1 << size) -1) = number - (2^size -1)

Which would be number - 2^size +1, but that's not necessarily equal to number - (2^size -1)

Wait, no, number - (2^size -1) = number - 2^size +1

So, it's the same.

But in the code, it's written as number - (1 << size) +1

Which is number - (2^size) +1

But according to the earlier analysis, for number=4, size=3, 1<<3=8, so 4 -8 +1=-3

Which is negative, violating the assertion.

Hence, there's a mistake in the function.

Wait, perhaps the while condition is wrong.

Maybe it should be while (1 << (size +1)) -1 <= number:

Which would be while 2^(size+1) -1 <= number:

But in the code, it's (1 << size +1) -1, which is (1<<size) +1 -1=1<<size

So, it's effectively while 1<<size <= number:

Which for number=4, size=1: 1<<1=2 <=4: size=2

size=2:1<<2=4 <=4: size=3

size=3:1<<3=8 >4: stop

So, size=3

Then, append 0,1,2 to sequence

Then, call func_1(4 - (1<<3)+1=4-8+1=-3, sequence)

Which violates the assertion.

Hence, there's an error in the function.

Perhaps the expression should be number - (1<<size) +1

Wait, maybe it's a typo in the function.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the function is designed to handle number =X-1, as in the main function func_1(n-1, result)

So, for X=5, number=4

Then, in func_1, it appends size elements, calls func_1 with number - (1<<size) +1

But in this case, number - (1<<size) +1=4-8+1=-3, which is invalid.

Hence, the function seems flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression should be number - (1<<size) +1, but adjusted to prevent negative values.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to handle number=(1<<size)-1, but it's not clear.

At this point, I'm confused about the implementation of func_1.

Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider that any array can be represented as a combination of segments where each segment is strictly increasing.

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each segment.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent X in binary and construct the array accordingly.

For example, if X=5, which is 101 in binary, I can have two segments: one of size 1 (contributes 2 subsequences: empty and the element itself) and another of size 1 (same), but that would give me 2*2=4, which is not 5.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can have a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences is 2^A + 2^B + ..., where A, B are the sizes of certain segments.

But in the sample input for X=5, which is 101 in binary, the array has three elements: [0,1,0]

Which has 5 increasing subsequences, as we saw earlier.

So, perhaps there's a connection between the binary representation of X and the structure of the array.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that for an array of N elements, the number of increasing subsequences can be less than or equal to 2^N.

If I can find a way to represent X as a sum of subsets of some kind, perhaps I can construct the array accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the binary representation to decide where to place duplicates in the array.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array by starting with a strictly increasing sequence and then introducing duplicates in specific positions to reduce the total number of increasing subsequences.

For example, for X=5, I can start with [0,1,2], which has 8 increasing subsequences, then introduce a duplicate to reduce it to 5.

But in the sample input, for X=5, the array is [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences.

Similarly, for X=13, the array is [2,2,3,4,2], which has 13 increasing subsequences.

I need to find a way to construct such arrays systematically.

Looking back at the provided program, perhaps it's using a binary representation to decide how to build the array.

But due to the mistake in the func_1 function, where it can lead to negative numbers, I think the function is flawed.

Therefore, I would say that the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
