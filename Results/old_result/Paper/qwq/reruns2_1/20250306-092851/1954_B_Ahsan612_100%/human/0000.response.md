Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a "beautiful" array, and I need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that it's no longer beautiful. If it's impossible to make it not beautiful, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what makes an array beautiful. According to the problem, an array is beautiful if I can make all its elements the same by using a specific operation any number of times. The operation is: choose an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) such that a[i-1] equals a[i+1], and replace a[i] with a[i-1]. Essentially, I'm smoothing out the array by replacing elements that are sandwiched between two identical elements with that identical value.

So, the goal is to make all elements equal by repeating this operation. Since the array is already beautiful, I don't need to worry about whether I can make it uniform; the problem states it's beautiful, meaning it's possible.

Now, I need to figure out how to make it not beautiful by removing the fewest possible elements. Removing elements could disrupt the sequences that allow the operations to be performed, thereby preventing the array from being made uniform.

Let me think about what makes an array not beautiful. If, after removals, there's no sequence of operations that can make all elements equal, then it's not beautiful.

Looking at the examples:

1. For n=3 and array [2,2,2], it's already uniform, and no matter how many elements I remove, it remains uniform. So, it's impossible to make it not beautiful, hence -1.

2. For n=5 and array [1,2,1,2,1], removing one element can break the pattern. For instance, removing the last element gives [1,2,1,2], which cannot be made uniform.

3. For n=1, it's a single element, which is already uniform. Removing the only element would make the array empty, but I guess an empty array is not considered beautiful, but the problem might have specifics on that. Probably, an empty array is not beautiful, so removing the single element would make it not beautiful, but the output is -1, which suggests that it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements. So, perhaps removing all elements is not allowed or considered invalid.

4. For n=7 and array [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], removing the first three elements gives [5,3,3,3], which cannot be made uniform.

From these examples, it seems that if the array consists of repeating blocks of different values, removing elements that separate these blocks can make it not beautiful.

I need to generalize this. It seems that if the array has multiple distinct runs of identical values, removing elements from the smallest run can break the ability to make all elements equal.

Wait, in the first test case, all elements are the same, so there's only one run. Removing elements won't change that; it remains uniform.

In the second test case, the array alternates: 1,2,1,2,1. So, runs are: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1. Removing one element can break this pattern.

In the third test case, single element, removing it might not be allowed, hence -1.

In the fourth test case, runs are: 3,5,3. Removing the first three elements (all 3s) leaves [5,3,3,3], which has runs 5,3. You can't make all elements the same because there's a 5 and a 3, and the operation can't change the 5 to 3 or vice versa.

So, perhaps the key is to look at the runs of identical values and find the smallest run. Removing all elements from that run would disrupt the ability to make all elements equal.

But in the first test case, all elements are the same, so there's only one run. Removing elements won't stop it from being beautiful because it remains uniform.

In the second test case, there are multiple runs. The smallest run is of size 1 (each 2 is a single element run). Removing one element can break the pattern.

In the fourth test case, runs are 3,5,3. The smallest run is 5, of size 1. Removing that single 5 breaks the array into [3,3,3,3], which is uniform, but wait, that's still beautiful. Oh, but in the explanation, removing the first three elements gives [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful. Wait, that's removing the first run of 3s, which is size 3. But according to my earlier thought, removing the smallest run, which is the single 5, should suffice.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. If I remove the single 5, I get [3,3,3,3], which is uniform and still beautiful. So, that doesn't make it not beautiful. So, perhaps removing the smallest run isn't always sufficient.

Hmm, maybe I need to remove enough elements to prevent any operation from being applied, or to create a situation where it's impossible to make all elements equal.

Let me look back at the operation: choose i (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) such that a[i-1] = a[i+1], and replace a[i] with a[i-1]. So, this operation allows me to change a[i] to a[i-1] only if a[i-1] equals a[i+1].

If I can repeatedly apply this operation to make all elements equal, then the array is beautiful.

To make it not beautiful, I need to prevent this from happening. That is, after removals, there should be no sequence of operations that can make all elements equal.

One way to think about this is to disrupt the continuity of values in such a way that it's impossible to make all elements the same.

Looking back at the second test case: [1,2,1,2,1]. If I remove the last element, I get [1,2,1,2]. Now, I can't make all elements equal because I can't turn all elements into 1 or 2 using the operations.

Wait, let's see:

- Start with [1,2,1,2]

- Possible operations:

- Choose i=2: a[1]=1, a[3]=1, so replace a[2]=2 with a[1]=1 → [1,1,1,2]

- Now, choose i=4: a[3]=1, a[5]=nothing (out of bounds), so no operation.

- From [1,1,1,2], I can't make all elements 1 because the last element is 2, and there's no operation to change it.

- Alternatively, choose i=3: a[2]=1, a[4]=2, which are different, so no operation.

- So, [1,1,1,2] cannot be made uniform.

- But the point is that after removing one element, the resulting array cannot be made uniform.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that [1,2,1,2] is not beautiful because no operation sequence can make all elements equal.

Wait, but in [1,2,1,2], I can choose i=2 to get [1,1,1,2], and then no more operations can be applied, and it's not uniform.

So, the array is not beautiful because I can't make all elements equal.

Wait, but according to the problem, the original array is beautiful, meaning that it is possible to make all elements equal from the original array. But after removals, it should be impossible to make all elements equal.

So, in this case, removing the last element turns it into [1,2,1,2], which is not beautiful because it's impossible to make all elements equal.

Wait, but in the original array [1,2,1,2,1], it is beautiful, meaning that it's possible to make all elements equal by applying operations.

How?

Let's see:

- Start with [1,2,1,2,1]

- Choose i=2: a[1]=1, a[3]=1 → replace a[2]=2 with 1 → [1,1,1,2,1]

- Now, choose i=4: a[3]=1, a[5]=1 → replace a[4]=2 with 1 → [1,1,1,1,1]

- All elements are now equal.

So, it's beautiful.

After removing the last element, we have [1,2,1,2].

- Start with [1,2,1,2]

- Choose i=2: a[1]=1, a[3]=1 → replace a[2]=2 with 1 → [1,1,1,2]

- Now, no more operations can be applied because there's no i where a[i-1]=a[i+1] differently.

- So, [1,1,1,2] cannot be made uniform.

Hence, the array is not beautiful.

So, by removing one element, I can make it not beautiful.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, removing the first three elements gives [5,3,3,3]. Let's see:

- [5,3,3,3]

- Check if it's beautiful.

- Can I make all elements equal?

- Choose i=2: a[1]=5, a[3]=3, which are different, so no operation.

- Choose i=3: a[2]=3, a[4]=3, so replace a[3]=3 with 3 (no change).

- No effect.

- So, [5,3,3,3] cannot be made uniform because there's no way to change the 5 to 3 or vice versa.

Hence, it's not beautiful.

So, the strategy seems to be: identify the smallest run that, when removed, prevents the array from being made uniform.

But in the first test case, all elements are the same, so any removal still keeps the array uniform. Hence, -1.

In the third test case, n=1, removing the single element leaves an empty array, which is not beautiful, but the output is -1, suggesting that removing all elements is not allowed or considered invalid.

So, perhaps if the array has only one unique value, it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, hence -1.

Otherwise, find the smallest run and remove it.

Wait, but in the second test case, the smallest run is of size 1 (each 2 is a single element run), and removing one element is sufficient.

In the fourth test case, the smallest run is the single 5, but removing it leaves [3,3,3,5,3,3,3] -> [3,3,3,3], which is uniform, still beautiful. Wait, no, in the explanation, removing the first three elements gives [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

Wait, perhaps I need to remove enough elements to ensure that there are at least two different runs remaining, and that no operation can make them equal.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have runs of different values. If there is only one unique value, then removing any elements won't help; it remains beautiful.

If there are multiple unique values, then I need to remove elements in such a way that I can't apply operations to make all elements equal.

One approach is to remove elements to leave at least two different values, and ensure that there's no way to use operations to make them equal.

But operations allow changing elements that are between two identical elements to that value.

So, if I can isolate elements that can't be changed, I can prevent the array from becoming uniform.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that after removals, there are elements that cannot be changed to match others.

This seems complicated.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

ar = list(map(int, input().split()))

same = 1

num = ar[0]

minn = inf

i = 1

while i < len(ar):

if ar[i] == num:

same += 1

else:

i += 1

num = ar[i]

minn = min(minn, same)

same = 1

i += 1

minn = min(minn, same)

if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):

print(-1)

else:

print(minn)

So, the code is iterating through the array, grouping consecutive identical elements into runs, and tracking the length of the smallest run.

Then, if the smallest run is of size 1 or larger, it prints the smallest run length; otherwise, it prints -1.

From the examples:

1. For [2,2,2], all elements are the same, minn=3, which is equal to len(ar), so output -1.

2. For [1,2,1,2,1], runs are [1],[2],[1],[2],[1], minn=1, which is less than len(ar), so output 1.

3. For [1], minn=1, which is equal to len(ar), so output -1.

4. For [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], runs are [3,3,3],[5],[3,3,3], minn=1, which is less than len(ar), so output 1.

But in the explanation, it says that removing three elements is necessary in the fourth test case, but according to this code, it would output 1.

Wait, discrepancy here.

In the fourth test case, runs are [3,3,3], [5], [3,3,3]. The smallest run is [5], of size 1. According to the code, it would output 1, but in the explanation, it says that removing the first three elements (which is a run of 3s, size 3) gives [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

So, perhaps removing the smallest run isn't sufficient in all cases.

Wait, maybe I need to remove all elements from the smallest run to ensure the array is not beautiful.

Wait, but in the first test case, all elements are the same, so removing any elements doesn't make it not beautiful.

In the second test case, removing one element from a run of size 1 breaks the array.

In the third test case, removing the only element leaves an empty array, which is not beautiful, but the output is -1, so perhaps removing all elements is not allowed.

In the fourth test case, removing the single 5 gives [3,3,3,3], which is still uniform, hence still beautiful. So, removing the smallest run doesn't necessarily make it not beautiful.

Hence, perhaps I need to remove enough elements to prevent any operation from being applied, or to ensure that multiple distinct runs remain in a way that operations can't make them equal.

This seems tricky.

Looking back at the code, it seems to assume that removing the smallest run is sufficient, but as shown in the fourth test case, that's not always the case.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, the fourth test case outputs 3, but according to the code, it would output 1.

So, there's a discrepancy.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says to output the minimum number of elements to remove to make it not beautiful, or -1 if impossible.

In the fourth test case, removing the single 5 isn't enough because [3,3,3,3] is still beautiful.

So, we need to remove more elements.

In the explanation, removing the first three elements gives [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

So, in this case, removing three elements is sufficient.

Hence, the minimum number should be 3, not 1.

So, the code is incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

But let's think further.

Maybe the minimum number of elements to remove is equal to the size of the smallest run that, when removed, makes the array not beautiful.

In the fourth test case, the smallest run is 5, of size 1, but removing it isn't enough.

So, perhaps I need to remove all elements from runs that, when removed, disconnect the array in a way that prevents making all elements equal.

This seems complex.

An alternative approach is to find the smallest set of elements to remove such that the remaining array has at least two distinct runs that cannot be made equal through operations.

Wait, perhaps if I remove elements to leave at least two distinct runs where the runs are not convertible to each other through operations, then the array is not beautiful.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to ensure that after removals, there are at least two different values that cannot be made equal through operations.

But operations allow changing elements that are between two identical elements to that value.

So, if I have runs alternating between different values, removing elements to leave at least two different runs might not be sufficient.

This is getting too convoluted.

Given the time constraints, I'll conclude that the provided code is incorrect because it doesn't account for cases where removing the smallest run isn't enough to make the array not beautiful.

Hence, Correctness: **False**
