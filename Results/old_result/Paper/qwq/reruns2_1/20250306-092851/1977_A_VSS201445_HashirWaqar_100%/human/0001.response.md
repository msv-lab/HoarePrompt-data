Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has some cubes, and he wants to build a tower by adding or removing one cube at a time in each move. He can either put one cube on top or remove one cube from the top. He does this for n moves, and I need to figure out if it's possible that after these n moves, the tower has exactly m cubes.

First, I need to understand the initial state. The tower starts with no cubes, right? So, it's empty at the beginning. Now, each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube. Importantly, removing a cube can only be done from the top, which makes sense for a tower.

Let me think about this step by step. If Nikita makes n moves, and each move is either +1 or -1, I need to see if the net result can be m cubes in the tower.

This sounds a bit like a simple arithmetic problem. If I let adding a cube be +1 and removing a cube be -1, then the total number of cubes after n moves would be the sum of these +1 and -1 operations starting from 0.

Wait, but there's a catch here. Removing a cube can only be done if there is at least one cube on the tower. So, you can't remove a cube if the tower is empty. That's an important constraint.

So, my initial thought was to just consider the sum of n moves of either +1 or -1, but I have to make sure that at no point do I try to remove a cube when there are none.

That seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the maximum and minimum possible number of cubes after n moves.

- If Nikita adds a cube in every move, he'll have n cubes.

- If he removes a cube in every move, but he can't remove more cubes than he has, so the minimum is not necessarily -n, because he can't remove cubes when the tower is empty.

Wait, actually, since he can't remove a cube when the tower is empty, the minimum number of cubes he can have is 0. For example, if he adds a cube and then removes it, he's back to 0.

So, the range of possible number of cubes after n moves is from 0 up to n, but not necessarily all numbers in between are achievable due to the constraint of not being able to remove cubes when the tower is empty.

This seems tricky. Maybe I need to find a condition that determines whether m is achievable from n moves.

Let me try to find a pattern or derive a formula.

Suppose Nikita makes a moves of adding a cube and b moves of removing a cube, with a + b = n.

But, he can't remove more cubes than he has at any point. So, the sequence of moves matters here.

This sounds like it could be related to balanced sequences or something similar in combinatorics.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the net effect.

If he adds a cubes and removes b cubes, then the net number of cubes is a - b.

But, a - b = m, and a + b = n.

So, from these two equations, I can solve for a and b.

Let's see:

a - b = m

a + b = n

Adding these two equations: 2a = m + n => a = (m + n)/2

Similarly, subtracting the first equation from the second: 2b = n - m => b = (n - m)/2

So, a = (m + n)/2 and b = (n - m)/2.

Now, a and b must be non-negative integers because you can't have negative moves.

So, for a and b to be integers, (m + n) must be even, and (n - m) must be even, because they are divided by 2.

Wait, actually, since a and b are integers, (m + n) must be even, and (n - m) must be even.

But, (m + n) and (n - m) are both even only if m and n are both even or both odd.

Because:

- If m and n are both even, m + n is even, n - m is even.

- If m and n are both odd, m + n is even, n - m is even.

- If one is even and the other is odd, m + n is odd, n - m is odd.

So, a and b are integers only if m and n are both even or both odd.

But, there's another condition: a and b must be non-negative.

So, a = (m + n)/2 >= 0

And b = (n - m)/2 >= 0

Since n and m are both positive integers >=1 as per the input constraints, a is always >=0 because m + n >=2.

But b = (n - m)/2 >=0 implies that n - m >=0, so n >= m.

Additionally, throughout the sequence of moves, the tower must never have a negative number of cubes.

This is where the sequence matters.

Even if a and b are integers and n >= m, we need to ensure that at no point does the number of cubes go negative.

But, since we can't remove cubes when the tower is empty, we need to ensure that the sequence of moves doesn't try to remove a cube when there are none.

Given that, if we follow the condition that n >= m and (n + m) is even, then it should be possible.

Wait, but in the earlier example:

Second test case: n=2, m=4

According to the formula, a = (4 + 2)/2 = 3, b = (2 - 4)/2 = -1

But b is negative, which is not allowed. So, it's impossible, which matches the sample output "No".

First test case: n=3, m=3

a = (3 + 3)/2 = 3, b = (3 - 3)/2 = 0

Which is fine, so "Yes".

Third test case: n=5, m=3

a = (3 + 5)/2 = 4, b = (5 - 3)/2 = 1

Which is fine, so "Yes".

So, based on this, it seems that the condition is:

- n >= m

- (n + m) is even

Because a and b must be integers, and b must be >=0, which implies n >= m.

Wait, but in the formula, a = (m + n)/2 and b = (n - m)/2.

For a and b to be integers, (m + n) must be even, and (n - m) must be even, which is guaranteed if m and n are both even or both odd.

But, in the second test case, n=2, m=4, which are both even, but n < m is not satisfied, so it's "No".

Wait, n=2 < m=4, which violates n >= m.

So, the condition is:

- n >= m

- (n + m) is even

If these two conditions are satisfied, then it's possible to have m cubes after n moves.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

Test case 1: n=3, m=3

n >= m: 3 >= 3

n + m = 6, which is even

So, "Yes"

Test case 2: n=2, m=4

n < m: 2 < 4

So, "No"

Test case 3: n=5, m=3

n >= m: 5 >= 3

n + m = 8, which is even

So, "Yes"

Seems consistent.

Let me think if there are any edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1, m=1

n >= m: 1 >= 1

n + m = 2, which is even

So, "Yes"

Edge case 2: n=1, m=0

n >= m: 1 >= 0

n + m = 1, which is odd

So, "No"

Wait, but according to the formula, a = (0 + 1)/2 = 0.5, which is not integer.

b = (1 - 0)/2 = 0.5, not integer.

So, "No"

Edge case 3: n=2, m=0

n >= m: 2 >= 0

n + m = 2, even

So, "Yes"

Possible sequence: add, remove.

Edge case 4: n=0, m=0

But n >=1 as per constraints, so n=1 minimum.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says 1 <= n, m <= 100.

So, n=1 is the smallest n.

Another edge case: n=4, m=2

n >= m: 4 >= 2

n + m = 6, even

So, "Yes"

Another edge case: n=3, m=2

n >= m: 3 >= 2

n + m = 5, which is odd

So, "No"

Seems like the condition holds.

Therefore, in the code, for each test case, we check if n >= m and (n + m) % 2 == 0.

If both conditions are satisfied, print "YES"; else, "NO".

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

Wait a second, in my reasoning, I have (n + m) % 2 == 0, but in the code, it's (n - m) % 2 == 0.

Is that a mistake?

Let me double-check.

From earlier:

a = (m + n)/2

b = (n - m)/2

For a and b to be integers, both (m + n) and (n - m) must be even.

But, actually, (m + n) and (n - m) are both even only if m and n are both even or both odd.

Because:

- If m and n are both even, m + n even, n - m even.

- If m and n are both odd, m + n even, n - m even.

- If one is even and one is odd, m + n odd, n - m odd.

So, checking (n - m) % 2 == 0 is equivalent to checking (n + m) % 2 == 0.

Because if (n - m) is even, then (n + m) is also even, and vice versa.

Because:

n - m = n + m - 2m

So, n - m and n + m differ by 2m, which is even.

Therefore, n - m is even if and only if n + m is even.

So, in the code, checking (n - m) % 2 == 0 is equivalent to checking (n + m) % 2 == 0.

Hence, the condition in the code is correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]

**Correctness:** **True**
