Alright, I have this problem to solve. Bob has a bakery, and on the opening day, he baked n buns that he wants to sell. The usual price for each bun is a coins, but to attract customers, he's running a promotion. In this promotion, he can choose some integer k (between 0 and the minimum of n and b) and sell the first k buns at a modified price. The price for the i-th bun (where i goes from 1 to k) is (b - i + 1) coins. The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price of a coins each.

My task is to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

First, I need to understand the promotion clearly. If Bob chooses k = 0, he sells all n buns at the usual price of a coins each, so the total profit would be n * a.

If he chooses k > 0, he sells the first k buns at decreasing prices starting from b coins down to (b - k + 1) coins, and the remaining (n - k) buns at a coins each.

So, the total profit for a given k would be:

Sum of prices for the first k buns + (n - k) * a

The sum of the first k buns' prices is:

Sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1)

This is an arithmetic series where the first term is b and the last term is (b - k + 1).

The sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term)

So, sum = k/2 * (b + (b - k + 1)) = k/2 * (2b - k + 1)

Therefore, total profit for a given k is:

k/2 * (2b - k + 1) + (n - k) * a

Now, I need to maximize this expression with respect to k, where k can be from 0 to min(n, b).

To find the maximum profit, I need to consider different values of k and see which one gives the highest profit.

But since n, a, and b can be up to 10^9, I need an efficient way to compute this without iterating through all possible k values.

Let me think about the conditions under which choosing a particular k would be better.

Case 1: b <= a

If b is less than or equal to a, then selling any bun at a price less than a wouldn't make sense because he's better off selling all buns at a coins each.

So, in this case, the maximum profit would be n * a.

Case 2: b > a

If b is greater than a, then there might be some benefit in choosing k > 0.

But I need to find the optimal k that maximizes the profit.

Let me look at the expression for profit:

Profit(k) = k/2 * (2b - k + 1) + (n - k) * a

Let me simplify this:

Profit(k) = k*b - k(k - 1)/2 + n*a - k*a

Profit(k) = k*b - (k^2 - k)/2 + n*a - k*a

Profit(k) = - (k^2)/2 + (b + 1/2)*k + n*a - k*a

Profit(k) = - (k^2)/2 + (b + 1/2 - a)*k + n*a

This is a quadratic equation in terms of k: Profit(k) = A*k^2 + B*k + C

Where A = -1/2, B = b + 1/2 - a, C = n*a

Since A is negative, this is a downward-opening parabola, so the maximum occurs at k = -B/(2*A)

But since k has to be an integer between 0 and min(n, b), I need to find the integer k in that range that maximizes profit.

Alternatively, since the problem constraints are large (up to 10^9), I need a way to compute this efficiently without iterating through all possible k.

Let me consider the difference in profit when increasing k by 1.

Profit(k+1) - Profit(k) = [ (k+1)*b - (k+1)*k/2 + (n - (k+1))*a ] - [ k*b - k*(k-1)/2 + (n - k)*a ]

Simplify:

= (k+1)*b - k*(k+1)/2 + (n - k - 1)*a - k*b + k*(k-1)/2 - (n - k)*a

= (k+1)*b - k*b - k*(k+1)/2 + k*(k-1)/2 + (n - k - 1)*a - (n - k)*a

= b - k*b + (-k*(k+1)/2 + k*(k-1)/2) + (-a)

= b - a - k

So, the difference is (b - a - k)

This means that as long as (b - a - k) > 0, increasing k increases the profit.

So, as long as k < (b - a), increasing k is beneficial.

When k = (b - a), the difference is zero, meaning profit doesn't change.

When k > (b - a), the difference becomes negative, so profit decreases.

Therefore, the optimal k is k = (b - a), but we need to make sure that k does not exceed min(n, b).

So, the optimal k is min(b - a, n, b)

Wait, but k cannot exceed min(n, b), so k = min(b - a, min(n, b))

But let's consider:

If b - a >= n, then k = n

Else if b - a <= b, then k = b - a

Wait, but k cannot exceed b, but b - a could be greater than b if a is negative, but a is at least 1, and b is at least 1, so b - a can be less than or equal to b.

Wait, b and a are both at least 1, so b - a can be from 0 to up to b - 1.

But in the problem statement, it says k can be up to min(n, b), so k cannot exceed n or b.

So, the optimal k is:

If b - a >= n, then k = n

Else, k = b - a

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, I thought k = b - a, but need to ensure k <= min(n, b)

But b - a can be less than or equal to b, and less than or equal to n.

Wait, no, b - a can be greater than b if a is negative, but a is at least 1, so b - a <= b only if a >=1, which it is.

Wait, if a = 1 and b = 5, then b - a = 4, which is less than b = 5.

If a = 3 and b = 3, then b - a = 0.

If a = 2 and b = 5, then b - a = 3.

So, in general, b - a can be from 0 up to b - 1.

But in the earlier difference analysis, I had that as long as k < b - a, increasing k increases profit.

At k = b - a, the difference is zero, and beyond that, it decreases.

Therefore, the optimal k is k = min(b - a, min(n, b))

But since k cannot exceed n or b, and b - a can be up to b - 1, but n can be up to 1e9, I need to handle large values efficiently.

Now, let's look at the provided code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The function reads t test cases, and for each test case, reads n, a, b.

Then, it has an if-elif-else structure:

if b <= a:

print(n * a)

elif b - a >= n:

print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))

else:

print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))

Let's analyze this.

Case 1: b <= a

In this case, the code correctly chooses k = 0 and sells all buns at a coins each, giving n * a profit.

Case 2: b - a >= n

Here, the code computes int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)

Let's see what this represents.

If b - a >= n, then according to my earlier analysis, k = n.

So, selling k = n buns at the modified price.

The sum of the modified prices is sum from i=1 to n of (b - i + 1)

Which is n * b - sum from i=1 to n of i + sum from i=1 to n of 1

Sum from i=1 to n of i = n(n+1)/2

Sum from i=1 to n of 1 = n

So, sum = n*b - n(n+1)/2 + n = n*b - n(n+1)/2 + n = n*b - n^2/2 - n/2 + n = n*b - n^2/2 + n/2

Which is n*(b - n/2 + 1/2)

But the code computes (2*b - n + 1)*n // 2

Let's see:

(2*b - n + 1)*n / 2 = n*(2*b - n + 1)/2 = n*b - n^2/2 + n/2

Which matches the sum above.

So, this seems correct.

Case 3: b - a < n and b > a

Here, the code computes int((b - a)*(b - a + 1)//2 + a*n)

According to my earlier analysis, when b - a < n, k = b - a

So, selling k = b - a buns at the modified price.

The sum of the modified prices is sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1)

Which is k*(2*b - k + 1)/2

Which is (b - a)*(2*b - (b - a) + 1)/2 = (b - a)*(b + a + 1)/2

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, k = b - a

Sum = k*(2*b - k + 1)/2

Which is (b - a)*(2*b - (b - a) + 1)/2 = (b - a)*(b + a + 1)/2

But the code computes (b - a)*(b - a + 1)/2 + a*n

Which is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me recalculate.

Sum of the first k buns at modified price: sum from i=1 to k of (b - i + 1)

Which is k*(b + (b - k + 1))/2 = k*(2*b - k + 1)/2

Then, the remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Total profit: k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k)

Now, in the code, for the case where b - a < n, it computes (b - a)*(b - a + 1)/2 + a*n

But according to the formula, it should be k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k)

Where k = b - a

So, substituting k = b - a:

(b - a)*(2*b - (b - a) + 1)/2 + a*(n - (b - a))

Which simplifies to:

(b - a)*(b + a + 1)/2 + a*(n - b + a)

But the code computes (b - a)*(b - a + 1)/2 + a*n

This seems different.

Let me check with an example.

Take n=4, a=4, b=5

From the example, it's said that k=1 is optimal, giving 5 + 4*3 = 5 + 12 = 17

According to the formula:

k = min(b - a, n, b) = min(1, 4, 5) =1

Sum =1*(2*5 -1 +1)/2 +4*(4-1) =1*10/2 +4*3=5 +12=17

Which matches.

But according to the code:

Since b - a =1 < n=4, it computes (1)*(1 +1)/2 +4*4=1 +16=17

Which also matches.

Another example: n=5, a=5, b=9

k = min(9-5,5,9)=4

Sum =4*(2*9 -4 +1)/2 +5*(5-4)=4*13/2 +5*1=26 +5=31

But according to the code, since b - a=4 < n=5, it computes 4*5/2 +5*5=10 +25=35

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, it should be 31, but the correct answer is 35.

Wait, perhaps my formula is wrong.

Wait, in the example, it's said that k=5 gives 9+8+7+6+5=35, which is more than k=4 giving 9+8+7+6=30, and remaining 1 bun at 5, total 30+5=35.

Wait, but according to my formula, for k=4:

Sum=4*(2*9 -4 +1)/2 +5*(5-4)=4*13/2 +5*1=26 +5=31

But actually, selling k=5 gives 9+8+7+6+5=35, which is higher.

So, my formula is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the optimal k.

Wait, perhaps the optimal k is not always min(b - a, n, b), but something else.

Wait, maybe it's better to choose k such that the price of the k-th bun is at least a.

That is, b - k +1 >= a

So, k <= b - a +1

Therefore, optimal k is min(n, b - a +1)

Wait, let's check this.

In the first example, n=4, a=4, b=5

k = min(4, 5-4+1)=2

But according to the example, k=1 is better, giving 17, while k=2 would give 5+4 +4*2=9 +8=17

Wait, same as k=1.

Another example: n=5, a=5, b=9

k = min(5,9-5+1)=5

So, k=5, giving 9+8+7+6+5=35, which matches the example.

Another example: n=10, a=10, b=5

k = min(10,5-10+1)=10-10+1=1, but min(10, -4+1)=min(10,-3)=0

But according to the problem, k cannot be negative, so k=0

Selling all at 10 coins, total 100, which matches the example.

Another example: n=5, a=5, b=11

k = min(5,11-5+1)=5

So, k=5, sum=5+4+3+2+1=15 +5*(5-5)=15, but according to the example, it should be 45, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the example, output is 45 for n=5, a=5, b=11

If k=5, sum=11+10+9+8+7=45, which matches.

So, my formula seems correct in this case.

Wait, earlier for n=4, a=4, b=5, k=2 gives 5+4 +4*2=13, but the example says 17.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, no, in the first example, k=1 gives 5 +4*3=17, and k=2 gives 5+4 +4*2=13, which is less.

Wait, but according to my formula, k = min(n, b - a +1)=min(4,5-4+1)=min(4,2)=2, but choosing k=1 gives higher profit.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the optimal k is the maximum k such that b - k +1 >= a

That is, k <= b - a +1

But in the first example, b - a +1=5-4+1=2, but choosing k=1 gives higher profit.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming that.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the k that maximizes the profit function.

Let me consider the profit function again:

Profit(k) = k*(2*b - k +1)/2 + a*(n -k)

I need to maximize this with respect to k.

Let me take the derivative with respect to k and set it to zero.

d(Profit)/dk = (2*b - 2*k +1)/2 + k*(-1)/2 - a = 0

Simplify:

(b - k + 0.5)/1 - a - k/2 =0

b - k +0.5 - a - k/2 =0

b - a +0.5 -1.5*k=0

1.5*k = b - a +0.5

k = (b - a +0.5)/1.5 = (2*b - 2*a +1)/3

This suggests that the maximum occurs at k = floor( (2*b - 2*a +1)/3 )

But this seems complicated, and since n and b can be up to 1e9, I need a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the point where the marginal profit starts decreasing.

From earlier, the difference in profit when increasing k by 1 is (b - a - k)

So, as long as b - a - k >0, increasing k increases profit.

When b - a - k <=0, increasing k decreases profit.

Therefore, the optimal k is the largest k such that k <= b - a

But in the first example, b - a =1, n=4

So, k=1, which matches the example.

In the second example, b - a=4, n=5

So, k=4, but the example says k=5 gives higher profit.

Wait, but according to this, k should be up to b - a=4, but choosing k=5 gives higher profit.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose k such that the price of the last bun in the promotion is at least a.

That is, b - k +1 >= a

So, k <= b - a +1

Therefore, the optimal k is min(n, b - a +1)

In the first example, k = min(4,1+1)=2, but choosing k=1 gives higher profit.

Wait, but according to the example, k=1 gives 17, while k=2 gives 5+4 +4*2=13, which is less.

So, in this case, choosing k=1 is better than k=2.

But according to the formula, k should be up to b - a +1=2.

Wait, perhaps the formula needs adjustment.

Wait, perhaps k should be up to b - a, not b - a +1.

Let me check.

If k <= b - a, then b - k +1 >= a +1, which is greater than a.

So, as long as k <= b - a, the last promoted bun is priced at a +1, which is higher than a.

Thus, it's beneficial to choose k up to b - a.

Beyond that, the price drops to a or below.

Therefore, the optimal k is min(n, b - a)

In the first example, k = min(4,1)=1, which matches the better profit of 17.

In the second example, k = min(5,4)=4, but choosing k=5 gives 35, which is higher.

Wait, but according to the formula, k should be min(5,4)=4, but choosing k=5 gives higher profit.

So, perhaps the formula needs adjustment.

Wait, perhaps k can be up to b - a +1, and check which one gives higher profit.

In the first example, k=1 or k=2.

For k=1: 5 +4*3=17

For k=2:5+4 +4*2=13

So, k=1 is better.

For k=0:4*4=16, which is less.

So, k=1 is optimal.

In the second example, k=4:9+8+7+6 +5*1=30+5=35

k=5:9+8+7+6+5=35

So, both k=4 and k=5 give 35.

k=3:9+8+7 +5*2=24+10=34

So, k=4 or k=5 are both optimal.

Given that, perhaps choosing k = min(n, b - a +1) would cover both optimal choices.

In this case, min(5,4)=4, which is optimal.

In the first example, min(4,2)=2, but k=1 is better.

Wait, perhaps this isn't consistent.

Wait, maybe I need to compute the sum for k = min(n, b - a +1) and k = min(n, b - a), and choose the one that gives higher profit.

In the first example, for k=1:17

For k=2:13

So, choose k=1.

But according to min(n, b - a +1)=2, which gives 13, which is less than 17.

So, this approach fails.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal k is the largest k such that b - k +1 >= a.

That is, k <= b - a +1

Then, among k from 0 to min(n, b - a +1), choose the one that maximizes profit.

But in the first example, k=1 is better than k=2.

So, perhaps I need to choose k such that b - k +1 >= a, and among those, choose the one that maximizes profit.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative approach is to compute the sum for k = min(n, b - a +1), and compare it with the sum for k = min(n, b - a), and choose the one that gives higher profit.

In the first example, k=1 gives higher profit than k=2.

In the second example, k=4 gives the same profit as k=5.

In another example where n=10, a=10, b=5, k=0 is optimal.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the sum for k = min(n, b - a +1), and if that sum is less than k = min(n, b - a), then choose the previous one.

But this seems too convoluted.

Looking back at the provided code:

if b <= a:

print(n * a)

elif b - a >= n:

print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))

else:

print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))

In the first example, b - a =1 < n=4, so it computes (1*2)/2 +4*4=1+16=17, which matches.

In the second example, b - a=4 < n=5, so (4*5)/2 +5*5=10+25=35, which matches.

In the third example, b - a=5-10=-5 < n=10, so k=0, giving 10*10=100, which matches.

In the fourth example, b - a=11-5=6 >= n=5, so (2*11 -5 +1)*5//2=(22-5+1)*5//2=18*5//2=45, which matches.

So, the code seems to be correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
