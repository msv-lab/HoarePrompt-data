Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There's this one-dimensional grid with cells containing either '<' or '>'. When a pinball is placed on a cell, it moves according to the direction of the arrow in that cell. After moving, the arrow in the original cell flips. The pinball keeps moving until it goes off the grid from either end, and I need to figure out how many seconds it takes for the pinball to exit the grid for each starting position.

First, I need to understand the movement rules clearly. So, if the pinball is on a cell with '>', it moves to the right, and if it's on a cell with '<', it moves to the left. After each move, the arrow in the cell it was on flips. So, if it was '>', it becomes '<', and vice versa.

I need to simulate this process for each starting position and count the number of seconds until the pinball exits the grid. The problem says that for each query (which corresponds to each starting position), I need to output the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

Given that n can be up to 5*10^5 and t can be up to 10^5, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 5*10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me think about how to approach this. Simulating the process for each starting position separately would be too slow because n can be up to 5*10^5 per test case. So, I need a smarter way to compute the exit time for each starting position without simulating each step.

I recall that in problems involving sequences of moves where the direction can change based on some rules, sometimes it's possible to model the movement as a series of reflections or to find a pattern that allows computing the exit time directly.

Let me consider what happens when the pinball moves. Each time it moves, it flips the arrow in the cell it was on. So, the state of the grid changes with each move. This makes it tricky because the path can be affected by previous moves.

Maybe I can think of the movement in terms of the number of times the pinball changes direction. Since each flip changes the direction for future pinballs starting from that cell, but in this case, we're always starting fresh for each query, meaning the grid resets to its initial state for each starting position.

Wait, the problem says "Note that we always place a pinball on the initial grid." So, for each query, the grid is reset to its original state before placing the pinball on the starting position. That means each query is independent, and I don't have to worry about the grid being modified by previous pinballs.

So, for each starting position, I need to simulate the movement until it exits, but since n is large, I need a smarter way than simulating each step.

Let me consider the movement pattern. Suppose the pinball starts at position i. If s_i is '>', it moves to i+1, and s_i becomes '<'. Then, at i+1, if s_{i+1} is '<', it moves to i, but s_{i+1} flips to '>'. Wait, this seems like it could lead to oscillations.

Wait, but the problem says that after moving, the arrow in the original cell flips. So, in the first step, starting at i with s_i='>', it moves to i+1, and s_i becomes '<'. Now, at i+1, s_{i+1} is whatever it was initially, but after moving, s_i is now '<'.

Wait, but in the next step, if s_{i+1} is '<', it would move to i, and s_{i+1} flips to '>'. But s_i is already '<', so if it moves back to i, it would flip s_{i+1} to '<' again? This seems complicated.

Maybe instead of thinking in terms of individual steps, I can find a mathematical formula or a pattern that allows me to compute the exit time directly.

I notice that each time the pinball hits a cell, it flips the arrow, but since we're starting fresh for each query, the grid is always in its initial state.

Wait, no. For each query, the grid is in its initial state before placing the pinball on the starting position. Then, as the pinball moves, it flips the arrows in the cells it leaves.

But since each query is independent, I can treat each starting position separately.

Is there a way to model this movement efficiently?

I recall a similar problem where particles move on a line and bounce off each other. There was a trick where you could treat the particles as passing through each other without changing their paths.

Is there something similar here?

Let me think differently. Suppose the pinball moves according to the initial directions, but with the flipping, it's like the directions are changing after each move.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of times the pinball changes direction due to the flips.

But this seems too vague. Let's look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=3

s="><<"

For starting position 1:

- s = > < <

- Step 1: position 1 is '>', move to position 2, s[1] becomes '<'

- Now s = < < <

- Step 2: position 2 is '<', move to position 1, s[2] becomes '>'

- Now s = < > <

- Step 3: position 1 is '<', move to position 0, exit.

Total steps: 3

For starting position 2:

- s = > < <

- Step 1: position 2 is '<', move to position 1, s[2] becomes '>'

- Now s = > < >

- Step 2: position 1 is '<', move to position 0, exit.

Total steps: 2

Wait, but according to the problem, for i=2, the answer is 6, not 2. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, looking back at the problem, it says:

"For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the grid."

And in the first test case, the output is "3 6 5", corresponding to starting positions 1,2,3.

But in my simulation above, for starting position 2, I got 2 steps, but the answer is 6. So maybe my simulation is wrong.

Let me try simulating starting from position 2 again, carefully.

Initial s: > < <

Step 1: position 2 is '<', move to position 1, s[2] becomes '>'

Now s: > < >

Step 2: position 1 is '<', move to position 0, exit.

Total steps: 2

But the answer is 6, so clearly, my simulation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the flipping rule.

Let me read the problem again.

"When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the following rules:

- If the pinball is on the i-th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right.

- After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i.e., if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa).

- The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one.

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i-th query, a pinball will be placed on the i-th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps."

Wait, in my simulation, I flipped the arrow after the pinball moved, but maybe I flipped the wrong arrow.

Wait, it says "After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted, where i is the cell the pinball was on."

So, in the first step, starting at position 2 with s[2] = '<', move to position 1, then flip s[2] to '>', so s becomes > > >

Then, in the second step, position 1 is '>', so move to position 2, flip s[1] to '<', so s becomes > < <

Then, in the third step, position 2 is '<', move to position 1, flip s[2] to '>', so s becomes > < >

Then, in the fourth step, position 1 is '<', move to position 0, exit.

Total steps: 4

But the answer is 6, so still discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some steps.

Let me try simulating again.

Initial s: > < <

Step 1: start at position 2, s[2] = '<', move to position 1, flip s[2] to '>', s = > < >

Step 2: position 1, s[1] = '<', move to position 0, flip s[1] to '>', s = > > >

Exit at step 2.

But according to the answer, it should be 6 steps.

Wait, maybe the simulation is more complex, and the grid's changes affect the path in a way I'm not accounting for.

This suggests that my initial approach of simulating step by step is not efficient and probably incorrect, given the discrepancy in the step count.

I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that each cell has a direction, and the flip happens after the pinball moves. So, the pinball's movement depends on the direction at its current position, and then that direction flips.

I need to find a way to compute the exit time for each starting position without simulating each step.

Perhaps I can model the movement in terms of the number of times the pinball changes direction due to the flips.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to represent the movement as a series of reflections or some mathematical formula.

Wait, maybe I can think of the grid as a series of drivers that push the pinball in a certain direction, and the flips change the drivers' directions over time.

But this seems too vague. Let's consider a different approach.

I recall that in some problems involving particles moving and interacting, it's possible to treat the particles as passing through each other without interference, and compute their paths accordingly.

Maybe something similar can be applied here.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each flip affects future pinballs starting from other positions, but in this problem, since each query is independent and the grid is reset each time, I don't need to worry about interactions between different starting positions.

Wait, but in reality, the flips only affect the current pinball's path, and for each query, the grid is reset.

So, for each starting position, I need to trace the path of the pinball until it exits, keeping track of the flips.

But with n up to 5*10^5, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me think about the sequence of moves for a pinball starting at position i.

Let's define a function that, given the current position and the current state of the grid, determines the next position and updates the grid.

But updating the grid at each step would be too slow for large n.

Is there a pattern or a cycle that the pinball follows?

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement as a permutation, where each position maps to the next position based on the direction, and the flips change the permutation over time.

But it's complicated because the permutation changes with each move.

Let me consider that each time the pinball moves from position i to position j, s_i flips.

So, the direction at position i changes after the move.

This means that if the pinball moves from i to j, then the next pinball that passes through i will see the opposite direction.

But since each query is independent, I need to consider the initial grid for each starting position.

Wait, maybe I can precompute for each position the sequence of positions the pinball would visit, considering the flips.

But this seems too involved.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix a starting position and try to simulate the movement.

At each step, the pinball moves according to the current direction at its position and then flips that direction.

I need to keep track of the grid's state as the pinball moves.

But again, this seems too slow for large n.

Is there a way to observe that the pinball's path is determined by the initial directions and the sequence of flips it causes?

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of the number of times the pinball has been through a cell and how that affects the direction.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that each cell has a direction that flips every time the pinball leaves it.

So, the direction at a cell oscillates between '<' and '>' each time the pinball leaves that cell.

But since the pinball can visit a cell multiple times, this complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the number of times the pinball has left a cell to determine its current direction.

But again, this seems too involved.

Let me consider that the problem mentions it can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid in a finite number of steps.

So, there must be some property of the grid that ensures the pinball doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop.

Given that, perhaps there's a way to compute the exit time based on the initial configuration without simulating each step.

Wait, maybe I can model the movement as a series of moves where the direction at each cell is determined by the initial direction and the number of times the pinball has left that cell.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that each time the pinball leaves a cell, the direction in that cell flips.

So, if the pinball visits a cell multiple times, the direction in that cell will flip each time it leaves.

This means that the direction in a cell is dependent on the number of times the pinball has left that cell.

But tracking this for each cell seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to find a way to compute the exit time based on the initial directions without tracking the flips explicitly.

Wait, maybe I can think of the flips as toggling the direction each time the pinball leaves, and find a pattern or formula that allows me to compute the exit time directly.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look at the example again.

First test case:

n=3

s="><<"

Queries:

1. Start at position 1: takes 3 steps

2. Start at position 2: takes 6 steps

3. Start at position 3: takes 5 steps

Wait, in my earlier simulation, I only got 4 steps for starting at position 2, but the answer is 6 steps. So, my simulation must be wrong.

Perhaps I need a better way to simulate or find a pattern.

Let me try to simulate starting from position 2 again, carefully.

Initial grid: > < <

Step 1: position 2, s[2] = '<', move to position 1, flip s[2] to '>', grid: > > >

Step 2: position 1, s[1] = '>', move to position 2, flip s[1] to '<', grid: < > >

Step 3: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: < < <

Step 4: position 3, s[3] = '<', move to position 2, flip s[3] to '>', grid: < > <

Step 5: position 2, s[2] = '<', move to position 1, flip s[2] to '>', grid: < > >

Step 6: position 1, s[1] = '>', move to position 2, flip s[1] to '<', grid: > > >

Step 7: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: > < <

Step 8: position 3, s[3] = '<', move to position 2, flip s[3] to '>', grid: > > >

Step 9: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: > < <

This seems to be going on forever. But according to the problem, it's guaranteed to exit in finite time.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simulation.

Wait, in step 6, after flipping s[1], it should be '<', so from position 1, s[1] = '<', move to position 0, exit.

Wait, no, in step 6, position 1, s[1] = '>', move to position 2, flip s[1] to '<'.

Then, step 7: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<'.

Step 8: position 3, s[3] = '<', move to position 2, flip s[3] to '>', grid: > > >

Step 9: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: > < >

Step 10: position 3, s[3] = '>', move to position 4, exit.

Wait, but n=3, so position 4 doesn't exist, so it exits at step 10.

But according to the answer, it should be 6 steps.

I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the steps.

Let me try simulating again, carefully.

Initial grid: > < <

Step 1: position 2, s[2] = '<', move to position 1, flip s[2] to '>', grid: > > >

Step 2: position 1, s[1] = '>', move to position 2, flip s[1] to '<', grid: < > >

Step 3: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: < < <

Step 4: position 3, s[3] = '<', move to position 2, flip s[3] to '>', grid: < > <

Step 5: position 2, s[2] = '<', move to position 1, flip s[2] to '>', grid: < > >

Step 6: position 1, s[1] = '<', move to position 0, exit.

Total steps: 6

Ah, I see. In my earlier simulation, I mistakenly continued beyond step 6. According to the correct simulation, it exits at step 6.

So, now I understand why the answer is 6 for starting position 2.

Similarly, for starting position 1:

Initial grid: > < <

Step 1: position 1, s[1] = '>', move to position 2, flip s[1] to '<', grid: < < <

Step 2: position 2, s[2] = '<', move to position 1, flip s[2] to '>', grid: < > >

Step 3: position 1, s[1] = '>', move to position 2, flip s[1] to '<', grid: > > >

Step 4: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: > < <

Step 5: position 3, s[3] = '<', move to position 2, flip s[3] to '>', grid: > > >

Step 6: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: > < >

Step 7: position 3, s[3] = '>', move to position 4, exit.

But n=3, so position 4 doesn't exist, so it exits at step 7.

But according to the answer, it's 3 steps.

Wait, maybe the pinball exits as soon as it moves outside the grid, regardless of the direction.

In the first simulation, starting at position 1:

Step 1: position 1 to position 2

Step 2: position 2 to position 1

Step 3: position 1 to position 0, exit.

So, exits at step 3.

I must have miscounted earlier.

Yes, in the correct simulation, it exits at step 3.

I must have made a mistake in my earlier simulation.

So, now I see that for starting position 1, it takes 3 steps to exit.

For starting position 2, it takes 6 steps.

For starting position 3, according to the answer, it's 5 steps.

Let me simulate starting at position 3:

Initial grid: > < <

Step 1: position 3, s[3] = '<', move to position 2, flip s[3] to '>', grid: > < >

Step 2: position 2, s[2] = '<', move to position 1, flip s[2] to '>', grid: > > >

Step 3: position 1, s[1] = '>', move to position 2, flip s[1] to '<', grid: < > >

Step 4: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: < < >

Step 5: position 3, s[3] = '<', move to position 2, flip s[3] to '>', grid: < > >

Step 6: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: < < >

Step 7: position 3, s[3] = '>', move to position 4, exit.

But according to the answer, it should be 5 steps.

Wait, perhaps the pinball exits as soon as it moves outside the grid, regardless of direction.

In this simulation, it exits at step 7.

But according to the answer, it should be 5 steps.

So, maybe I'm still misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the pinball exits when it tries to move outside the grid, but doesn't count the step where it exits.

For example, in starting at position 1:

Step 1: position 1 to position 2

Step 2: position 2 to position 1

Step 3: position 1 to position 0, exit.

So, total steps: 3

Similarly, starting at position 2:

Step 1: position 2 to position 1

Step 2: position 1 to position 2

Step 3: position 2 to position 3

Step 4: position 3 to position 2

Step 5: position 2 to position 1

Step 6: position 1 to position 0, exit.

Total steps: 6

Starting at position 3:

Step 1: position 3 to position 2

Step 2: position 2 to position 1

Step 3: position 1 to position 2

Step 4: position 2 to position 3

Step 5: position 3 to position 2

Step 6: position 2 to position 1

Step 7: position 1 to position 0, exit.

But according to the answer, it should be 5 steps.

Wait, maybe the step where it exits doesn't count.

Wait, no, the problem says "calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the grid", which I interpret as the number of steps until it exits.

But in the simulation for starting at position 3, it exits at step 7, but the answer is 5.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement rules.

Wait, perhaps the flipping happens before moving to the next cell.

But according to the problem, "After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted."

So, flip the arrow after moving.

In my earlier simulation, I flipped after moving, but maybe I made a mistake in the sequence.

Let me try simulating starting at position 3 again.

Initial grid: > < <

Step 1: position 3, s[3] = '<', move to position 2, flip s[3] to '>', grid: > < >

Step 2: position 2, s[2] = '<', move to position 1, flip s[2] to '>', grid: > > >

Step 3: position 1, s[1] = '>', move to position 2, flip s[1] to '<', grid: < > >

Step 4: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: < < >

Step 5: position 3, s[3] = '<', move to position 2, flip s[3] to '>', grid: < > >

Step 6: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: < < >

Step 7: position 3, s[3] = '<', move to position 2, flip s[3] to '>', grid: < > >

Step 8: position 2, s[2] = '>', move to position 3, flip s[2] to '<', grid: < < >

Step 9: position 3, s[3] = '<', move
