Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game on a checkered board where Alice and Bob are moving their chips based on specific rules, and I need to determine who wins or if it's a draw when both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game setup. The board has h rows and w columns. Alice starts at (x_a, y_a) and Bob at (x_b, y_b). Alice moves down, down-right, or down-left, while Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left. They take turns, with Alice starting first.

The goal for each player is to land on the opponent's chip to win. If a player can't make a move—Alice if she's in the last row, Bob if he's in the first row—it's a draw.

I need to determine the outcome for multiple test cases, given the board dimensions and initial positions.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider the movement capabilities of both players.

Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left. So, her row increases by 1 each move, and her column can stay the same or move one to the left or right.

Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left. His row decreases by 1 each move, and his column can stay the same or move one to the left or right.

Since Alice moves down and Bob moves up, their rows will get closer to each other over time. The key is to see if they can meet in the same cell.

Let me consider the row difference between Alice and Bob, which is (c - a). Since Alice moves down and Bob moves up, the number of moves Alice makes is (c - a), assuming she moves directly towards Bob.

Wait, but Alice can't necessarily make (c - a) moves if she reaches the bottom before that.

Wait, no, since Alice moves down by 1 each move, and Bob moves up by 1 each move, the relative speed at which they close the gap is 2 rows per two moves (one move each).

Wait, more carefully: each turn consists of Alice moving first, then Bob moving. So, in one full turn (Alice's move + Bob's move), the row difference decreases by 2 because Alice moves down 1 and Bob moves up 1.

Therefore, the number of full turns before they potentially meet is floor((c - a - 1)/2), assuming c > a.

Wait, let's think about it differently.

Let me define the row difference d = c - a.

If d is even, then after d/2 moves by Alice and d/2 moves by Bob, they will be in the same row.

If d is odd, then after floor(d/2) moves by Alice and floor(d/2) moves by Bob, Alice will still be one row below Bob.

So, in the case where d is even, they can potentially meet in the same cell.

In the case where d is odd, Alice will be in row a + d/2, and Bob will be in row c - d/2, which would be a + d/2 + 1, since d = c - a.

So, Alice is in a lower row than Bob.

Wait, let's verify that.

If d is odd, say d = 2k + 1.

Then, after k moves by Alice and k moves by Bob:

- Alice is at a + k

- Bob is at c - k = a + d - k = a + 2k + 1 - k = a + k + 1

So, Alice is in row a + k, Bob in a + k + 1.

So, Alice is still below Bob.

Then, on the next move, it's Alice's turn again since she moves first.

So, Alice moves down to a + k + 1, where Bob is.

At this point, if their columns match, Alice wins.

Otherwise, Bob can try to move to Alice's position.

Wait, but Bob moves up, so if Alice moves to a + k + 1, Bob can't move down to her; he can only move up.

Wait, no, Bob can't move down; he can only move up.

Wait, but in this scenario, Bob is already above Alice, and he can only move up further away.

So, if Alice moves to the same row as Bob, and their columns match, she wins.

Otherwise, Bob can't reach her because he can only move up.

Therefore, in the case where d is odd, Alice can reach Bob's row, and if she can align their columns, she wins.

Similarly, in the case where d is even, after d/2 moves, both are in the same row, and they can try to align their columns.

But I need to consider their column movements as well.

Both can move their columns left or right by up to the number of moves they make.

Wait, more precisely, Alice can adjust her column by up to the number of moves she makes, and similarly for Bob.

Wait, but Alice can move her column by at most the number of moves she makes, since each move can adjust the column by at most 1.

Similarly for Bob.

So, in the case where d is even:

- After d/2 moves by Alice and d/2 moves by Bob, they are in the same row.

- Alice can have adjusted her column by up to d/2 steps left or right from her starting position.

- Similarly, Bob can have adjusted his column by up to d/2 steps left or right from his starting position.

- So, Alice can reach any column between y_a - d/2 and y_a + d/2, within the board limits.

- Bob can reach any column between y_b - d/2 and y_b + d/2, within the board limits.

- If their possible column ranges overlap, then Alice can position herself in a column that Bob can also reach, and thus Alice can win.

Wait, but actually, since Alice moves first in the last move when d is even, Alice can choose to move to a column that Bob can't reach, forcing a draw or something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider the effective number of moves Alice and Bob can make.

If d is even:

- After d/2 moves by Alice and d/2 moves by Bob, they are in the same row.

- At this point, Alice can choose her column within y_a ± d/2.

- Bob can choose his column within y_b ± d/2.

- If Alice can position herself in a column that Bob can also reach, she wins.

- Otherwise, Bob can position himself in a way to avoid her.

Wait, but Bob is moving up, away from Alice.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after Alice moves to the same row as Bob, Bob has already moved up, so they are in different rows unless d is odd.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think in terms of who has the last move.

If d is even:

- Total moves: d moves by Alice and d moves by Bob.

- After d moves by Alice, she is at a + d.

- After d moves by Bob, he is at c - d.

- But since d = c - a, c - d = a.

- So, they both end up in row a.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because Bob moves up d times from c, so c - d = a, since d = c - a.

So, they both end up in row a.

But Alice also moves d times down from a to a + d, which would be a + (c - a) = c.

Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of total moves.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of moves Alice can make before reaching row c.

Since Alice starts at a and needs to reach c, she needs exactly c - a moves down.

During these c - a moves, Bob will make c - a moves up, starting from c.

So, Bob will end up at c - (c - a) = a.

So, after Alice moves c - a times, she is at row c, and Bob is at row a.

But Alice's goal is to be at the same cell as Bob, who is at row a.

But Alice can't be in row c and row a at the same time.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can only reach row c if she makes exactly c - a moves down.

But by that time, Bob has moved up c - a times from c to a.

So, Alice is at (c, y_a + something), and Bob is at (a, y_b + something).

But a != c, so they are in different rows.

Wait, this seems confusing.

Maybe I need to consider the relative movement.

Let me consider the row difference d = c - a.

Each turn consists of Alice moving down 1 and Bob moving up 1, so the row difference decreases by 2 per turn.

So, the number of full turns is floor(d / 2).

After floor(d / 2) turns, the row difference is d - 2 * floor(d / 2).

If d is even, the row difference becomes 0.

If d is odd, the row difference becomes 1.

But since Alice moves first, if d is odd, after floor(d / 2) turns, the row difference is 1, with Alice in row a + floor(d / 2) and Bob in row c - floor(d / 2) = a + floor(d / 2) + 1.

Then, Alice moves one more time to row a + floor(d / 2) + 1, which is the same as Bob's row.

At this point, if their columns match, Alice wins.

Otherwise, Bob can't move down to her, so it's a draw.

Wait, but Bob can still move, and perhaps position himself to block Alice.

Wait, no, Bob can only move up, so if Alice is in the same row as Bob, Bob can't move down to her; he can only move up, away from her.

Therefore, if Alice can position herself in the same cell as Bob when they are in the same row, she wins.

Otherwise, it's a draw.

Similarly, if d is even, after d/2 turns, both are in row a + d/2.

But wait, a + d/2 = c - d/2.

Wait, no, d = c - a, so c = a + d.

Therefore, a + d/2 = c - d/2.

So, both are in row a + d/2.

Then, in this case, both are in the same row, and they can adjust their columns.

Alice can adjust her column by up to d/2 steps from y_a.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column by up to d/2 steps from y_b.

So, if the intervals [y_a - d/2, y_a + d/2] and [y_b - d/2, y_b + d/2] overlap, Alice can choose a column in the overlapping region, and Bob can't prevent her from being there, so Alice wins.

Otherwise, there's no overlap, and it's a draw.

Wait, but Bob can also choose his column.

Wait, but Bob is moving up, so his column can be adjusted by up to d/2 steps.

But since they both end up in the same row, they can independently choose their column within d/2 steps from their starting columns.

So, if their possible column ranges overlap, Alice can choose a column in the overlap, and Bob can't block her, so Alice wins.

Otherwise, no overlap, draw.

Similarly, in the case where d is odd, after Alice moves to the same row as Bob, if she can position herself in a column that Bob could have reached, she wins.

Otherwise, it's a draw.

Wait, but Bob is moving up, so his possible columns are limited by his moves.

Wait, perhaps I need to formalize this.

Let me define:

- For d even:

- After d/2 moves, both are in row a + d/2.

- Alice's possible columns: y_a - d/2 to y_a + d/2.

- Bob's possible columns: y_b - d/2 to y_b + d/2.

- If these intervals overlap, Alice can choose a column in the overlap and win.

- Else, draw.

- For d odd:

- After floor(d/2) moves, Alice is in row a + floor(d/2), Bob in a + floor(d/2) + 1.

- Then Alice moves to row a + floor(d/2) + 1.

- At this point, Bob has already moved up, so he's in a + floor(d/2) - 1.

- Wait, no.

- Wait, with d odd:

- After floor(d/2) moves, Alice is in a + floor(d/2), Bob is in a + floor(d/2) + 1.

- Then Alice moves to a + floor(d/2) + 1.

- Bob, on his next move, moves up to a + floor(d/2).

- So, now Alice is in a + floor(d/2) + 1, Bob in a + floor(d/2).

- So, they are in different rows again.

- Therefore, Alice can't capture Bob, and it's a draw.

Wait, perhaps in this case, it's always a draw.

Wait, but according to the sample input and output, sometimes it's Alice wins, sometimes Bob wins, sometimes draw.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider more carefully.

Let me look back at the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

12

6 5 2 2 5 3

4 1 2 1 4 1

1 4 1 3 1 1

5 5 1 4 5 2

4 4 1 1 4 4

10 10 1 6 10 8

10 10 2 6 10 7

10 10 9 1 8 1

10 10 8 1 10 2

10 10 1 1 2 1

10 10 1 3 4 1

10 10 3 1 1 1

Sample Output:

Alice

Bob

Draw

Draw

Alice

Bob

Alice

Alice

Looking at the first test case:

6 5 2 2 5 3

So, h=6, w=5, a=2, b=2, c=5, d=3

Row difference d = c - a = 3, which is odd.

According to my earlier reasoning, it should be a draw, but the sample output is Alice.

Hmm, so my earlier reasoning is incomplete.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider the number of moves and who has the last move.

In the case where d is odd, Alice has the last move, so she can choose to land on Bob's position if possible.

Similarly, for d even, Bob has the last move.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Total moves needed to close the row difference:

For d even, it takes d/2 turns.

Each turn consists of one move by Alice and one by Bob.

So, total moves: d/2 by Alice and d/2 by Bob.

For d odd, it takes floor(d/2) turns, plus one more move by Alice.

So, total moves: floor(d/2) by Alice and floor(d/2) by Bob, plus one more by Alice.

Now, considering column adjustments.

Alice can adjust her column by up to the number of moves she makes.

Similarly for Bob.

So, in d even:

- Alice can adjust column by up to d/2.

- Bob can adjust column by up to d/2.

- If their column ranges overlap, Alice can choose a column in the overlap and win.

- Else, draw.

In d odd:

- Alice can adjust column by up to floor(d/2) + 1 (since she has one more move).

- Bob can adjust column by up to floor(d/2).

- If Alice can reach Bob's column within her adjustments, she wins.

- Else, draw.

Wait, perhaps I need to formalize the column ranges.

Let me define:

- For d even:

- Alice's possible columns: y_a - d/2 to y_a + d/2

- Bob's possible columns: y_b - d/2 to y_b + d/2

- If these intervals overlap, Alice can win; else, draw.

- For d odd:

- Alice's possible columns: y_a - floor(d/2) - 1 to y_a + floor(d/2) + 1

- Bob's possible columns: y_b - floor(d/2) to y_b + floor(d/2)

- If Alice can position herself in a column that Bob can also reach, she wins.

- Else, draw.

Wait, but in the first sample input:

h=6, w=5, a=2, b=2, c=5, d=3

d = c - a = 3, which is odd.

floor(d/2) = 1

So, Alice can adjust column by up to 1 + 1 = 2 (since she has floor(d/2) + 1 moves for column adjustment).

Bob can adjust column by up to 1.

So, Alice's possible columns: 2 - 2 to 2 + 2 → [0,4]

But columns are from 1 to 5, so [1,4]

Bob's possible columns: 3 -1 to 3 +1 → [2,4]

Overlap is [2,4], so Alice can choose a column in [2,4], say 3, and win.

Hence, Alice wins.

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

4 1 2 1 4 1

d = 4 - 2 = 2, even.

Alice's possible columns: 1 -1 to 1 +1 → [0,2] → [1,1] (since w=1)

Bob's possible columns:1 -1 to 1 +1 → [0,2] → [1,1]

Overlap is [1,1], so Alice can choose column 1 and win.

But sample output is Bob.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake.

Wait, w=1, so columns are only 1.

Alice starts at (2,1), Bob at (4,1)

d=2, even.

After 1 turn (Alice moves down to 3, column 1; Bob moves up to 3, column 1)

Now, they are both in (3,1)

Alice can't move further down (since h=4, and she's at 3), and Bob can't move up (at row 3).

Wait, but according to the rules, if a player can't make a move, it's a draw.

But in this case, Alice can't move down from row 3 to row 4 because h=4, and she's at row 3, but she can move to row 4.

Wait, no, rows are numbered from 1 to h.

So, if Alice is at row h, she can't move down.

Here, h=4, Alice is at row 3, so she can move to row 4.

Wait, but in the sample input, h=4, a=2, c=4.

So, d=2, even.

After 1 turn, Alice is at 3,1; Bob is at 3,1.

Then Alice moves to 4,1; Bob moves to 2,1.

Now, Alice is at 4,1 and Bob is at 2,1.

They are in different rows, and Alice can't move further, so it's a draw.

But according to the sample output, it's Bob.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, perhaps the rule is that if Alice can't move, it's a draw, but if Bob can force Alice into a position where she can't move, it's Bob's win.

Wait, need to read the problem again.

"A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ), the game immediately ends in a draw."

So, if a player places their chip on the opponent's chip, they win immediately.

If a player can't make a move when it's their turn, it's a draw.

So, in the second sample input, after Alice moves to (4,1), she can't move further, so it's a draw.

But the sample output is "Bob".

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps Bob can force a win.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me look at the code provided to understand how it's implemented.

The code is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))

if a > c:

print('Draw')

else:

x = abs(a - c) // 2

if abs(a - c) % 2:

l = max(1, d - x)

r = min(w, d + x)

print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])

else:

l = max(1, b - x)

r = min(w, b + x)

print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])

So, in the case where a > c, it's immediately a draw.

Else, compute x = floor((c - a)/2)

If (c - a) is odd:

Compute l = max(1, d - x)

r = min(w, d + x)

Check if abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1

If both, Alice wins; else, draw.

Else (c - a is even):

Compute l = max(1, b - x)

r = min(w, b + x)

Check if abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x

If both, Bob wins; else, draw.

Wait, in the second sample input:

h=4, w=1, a=2, b=1, c=4, d=1

a=2, c=4, c - a =2, even.

x = 1

l = max(1,1 -1)=1

r = min(1,1 +1)=1

Check if abs(1 -1) <=1 and abs(1 -1) <=1 → 0 <=1 and 0 <=1 → true → Bob wins.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be a draw.

But sample output is "Bob".

So, perhaps Bob wins in this case.

Wait, perhaps Bob can force Alice into a position where she can't move, hence winning.

Wait, in this case, Bob can position himself in a way that blocks Alice's movement.

Wait, but in this setup, h=4, a=2, c=4, w=1, b=1, d=1.

After 1 move: Alice moves to 3,1; Bob moves to 3,1.

Then Alice moves to 4,1; Bob moves to 2,1.

Now, Alice is at 4,1 and Bob at 2,1.

Alice can't move further, so it's a draw.

But according to the code and sample output, it's Bob.

So, perhaps my reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps Bob can win by landing on Alice's position before she gets stuck.

Wait, perhaps I need to simulate the moves more carefully.

Let me try to simulate the moves.

Turn 0: Alice at (2,1), Bob at (4,1)

Turn 1: Alice moves to (3,1); Bob moves to (3,1)

Now, they are both at (3,1). Bob lands on Alice's position, so Bob wins.

Ah, I see. So, Bob moves after Alice, and in this case, he can land on her position.

Hence, Bob wins.

So, in this scenario, Bob wins.

Therefore, the code is correct in this case.

Another sample input: 1 4 1 3 1 1

Here, h=1, w=4, a=1, b=3, c=1, d=1

a > c is not true since a=1 and c=1.

d - a =0, even.

x=0

l = max(1,3 -0)=1

r = min(4,3 +0)=3

Check if abs(1 -1) <=0 and abs(3 -1) <=0 → 0 <=0 and 2 <=0 → false → draw.

Sample output is "Draw", which matches.

Another sample input: 5 5 1 4 5 2

d=4, even.

x=2

l=max(1,4-2)=2

r=min(5,4+2)=5

Check if abs(2-2)<=2 and abs(5-2)<=2 → 0<=2 and 3<=2 → false → draw.

Sample output is "Draw", matches.

Another sample input: 4 4 1 1 4 4

d=3, odd.

x=1

l=max(1,4-1)=1

r=min(4,4+1)=4

Check if abs(1-1)<=1+1 and abs(4-1)<=1+1 → 0<=2 and 3<=2 → false → draw.

Sample output is "Draw", matches.

Another sample input: 10 10 1 6 10 8

d=9, odd.

x=4

l=max(1,8-4)=4

r=min(10,8+4)=10

Check if abs(4-6)<=4+1 and abs(10-6)<=4+1 → 2<=5 and 4<=5 → true → Alice wins.

Sample output is "Alice", matches.

Another sample input: 10 10 2 6 10 7

d=8, even.

x=4

l=max(1,6-4)=2

r=min(10,6+4)=10

Check if abs(2-7)<=4 and abs(10-7)<=4 → 5<=4 and 3<=4 → false → draw.

Sample output is "Draw", matches.

Another sample input: 10 10 9 1 8 1

d=7, odd.

x=3

l=max(1,1-3)=1

r=min(10,1+3)=4

Check if abs(1-1)<=3+1 and abs(4-1)<=3+1 → 0<=4 and 3<=4 → true → Alice wins.

Wait, but sample output is "Draw".

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, sample input 8: 10 10 9 1 8 1

d=8-9=-1, but since c=8
