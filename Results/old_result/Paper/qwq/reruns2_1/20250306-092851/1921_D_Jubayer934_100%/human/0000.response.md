Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a larger array of m integers, where m is at least n. Vasya wants to arrange these m integers in a certain order to maximize the total difference D, which is the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of his array c and Petya's array a.

Okay, so the goal is to maximize D = sum of |a_i - c_i| for i from 1 to n.

First, I need to understand what makes D as large as possible. Since D is the sum of absolute differences, to maximize D, I need to choose c_i such that |a_i - c_i| is as large as possible for each i.

One way to approach this is to pair the smallest a_i with the largest possible c_i and the largest a_i with the smallest possible c_i, or something along those lines. I need to think about how to pair the elements to maximize the differences.

Let me consider sorting both arrays. If I sort array a in ascending order and array b in descending order, then for each i, |a_i - b_i| would be maximized, right? Wait, not necessarily, because it depends on the actual values.

Wait, maybe I should sort a in ascending order and b in descending order and then pair them accordingly. Let's think about an example.

Take the first example from the input:

n=4, m=6

a: 6 1 2 4 → sorted a: 1, 2, 4, 6

b: 3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 3 → sorted b in descending: 7, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1

Now, if I pair sorted a with sorted b:

a: 1 → b: 7 → |1-7|=6

a: 2 → b: 5 → |2-5|=3

a: 4 → b: 3 → |4-3|=1

a: 6 → b: 3 → |6-3|=3

Total D: 6+3+1+3=13

But in the example, it says the output is 16. So, 13 is not the maximum possible. Hmm.

In the explanation, they chose c as (1,5,7,2):

D = |6-1| + |1-5| + |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16

So, that's higher than what I got. Maybe my initial approach is not optimal.

Let me think differently. Maybe I need to consider pairing each a_i with the c_i that maximizes |a_i - c_i|, but I have to choose n distinct c_i's from b.

Wait, but c can be any selection of n elements from b, in any order.

So, perhaps I need to select n elements from b and arrange them in such a way that the sum of absolute differences with a is maximized.

This sounds like I need to select a permutation of n elements from b to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

This seems similar to the assignment problem where I need to pair elements of a with elements of c (selected from b) to maximize the sum of differences.

One way to approach this is to sort a and sort b, and then pair the smallest a with the smallest b, or the smallest a with the largest b, and see which gives a higher difference for each pair.

Wait, in the first approach, sorting a and b in opposite orders and pairing them gives a certain sum, but in the example, choosing a different permutation of b gives a higher sum.

So, maybe I need to consider all possible pairings and choose the one that gives the maximum sum.

But that's not efficient, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort array a in ascending order.

- Sort array b in descending order.

- For each a_i, choose the c_i from b that maximizes |a_i - c_i|.

But I have to choose n distinct c_i's from b.

Wait, but b can have duplicates, so "distinct" might not be the right word. I can choose the same element from b multiple times if it appears multiple times in b.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "choose some n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order". So, I can choose the same element multiple times if it appears multiple times in b.

But in the first example, b is [3,5,1,7,2,3], so 3 appears twice. So, I can choose c as [3,3,7,1], for example.

Wait, but in the explanation, they chose c as [1,5,7,2], which are all distinct, but they don't have to be.

So, to maximize D, for each a_i, I want to choose c_i such that |a_i - c_i| is as large as possible, given the constraints of which c_i's have been chosen already.

This sounds like I need to select n elements from b (with duplicates allowed if they appear multiple times in b) and arrange them in a way that maximizes the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

This seems similar to the hungarian algorithm for assignment problems, but that's too slow for n=2e5.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the properties of the absolute difference.

|a_i - c_i| is maximized when c_i is as far away from a_i as possible.

So, to maximize the sum, I should pair each a_i with a c_i that is as far away from a_i as possible.

Given that, perhaps sorting a and b and then pairing the smallest a with the largest b and the largest a with the smallest b would achieve this.

Let me test this idea with the first example.

sorted a: 1,2,4,6

sorted b in descending: 7,5,3,3,2,1

Now, pair a[1]=1 with b[1]=7: |1-7|=6

a[2]=2 with b[2]=5: |2-5|=3

a[3]=4 with b[3]=3: |4-3|=1

a[4]=6 with b[4]=3: |6-3|=3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13, but the example gives 16.

So, this approach is not optimal.

In the example, they chose c as [1,5,7,2], which gives D=16.

Wait, another way: maybe sort a and sort b, then for each a_i, choose either the largest available b or the smallest available b that hasn't been chosen yet.

But that might not work either, because once you choose a c_i, it's removed from the pool.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as selecting c's to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

Given that, maybe I can sort a and sort b, and then for each a_i, choose the c_i that maximizes |a_i - c_i|, considering the choices made so far.

But that's still too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort array a in ascending order.

- Sort array b in descending order.

- For each a_i, choose c_i as b_i, which is the largest available b for the smallest a, and so on.

- But as we've seen, this doesn't give the maximum D.

- Maybe I need to consider choosing for some a_i's the smallest b's instead.

Wait, perhaps for some a_i's, pairing with the largest b is better, and for others, pairing with the smallest b is better.

Let me think about it.

Suppose a_i is small, then pairing it with the largest b would give a large difference.

If a_i is large, pairing it with the smallest b would give a large difference.

So, perhaps I should pair the smallest a's with the largest b's and the largest a's with the smallest b's.

Let me try this with the first example.

sorted a: 1,2,4,6

sorted b in descending: 7,5,3,3,2,1

Pair a[1]=1 with b[1]=7: |1-7|=6

a[2]=2 with b[2]=5: |2-5|=3

a[3]=4 with b[5]=2: |4-2|=2

a[4]=6 with b[6]=1: |6-1|=5

Total D=6+3+2+5=16, which matches the example.

Okay, that seems promising.

So, the approach is:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in descending order.

- For the first floor(n/2) elements, pair a[i] with b[i], and for the remaining ceil(n/2) elements, pair a[i] with b[m - (n - i)].

Wait, in the example, n=4, m=6.

sorted a: 1,2,4,6

sorted b: 7,5,3,3,2,1

Pair a[1]=1 with b[1]=7: |1-7|=6

a[2]=2 with b[2]=5: |2-5|=3

a[3]=4 with b[4]=3: |4-3|=1

a[4]=6 with b[5]=2: |6-2|=4

Wait, that gives D=6+3+1+4=14, which is still not 16.

Wait, in the earlier step, I had paired a[3] with b[5]=2, which gave |4-2|=2, but in this case, b[4]=3, which gives |4-3|=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose for a[3], not b[4], but b[m - (n - i)], which in this case would be b[6 - (4 - 3)] = b[6 -1]=b[5]=2.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, generalizing:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in descending order.

- For i from 0 to n-1:

- If i < n/2:

- c_i = b[i]

- Else:

- c_i = b[m - (n - i -1)]

Wait, in code terms, zero-indexed:

for i in range(n):

if i < n//2:

c[i] = b[i]

else:

c[i] = b[m - (n - i -1)]

Wait, in the first example:

n=4, m=6

b sorted descending: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

for i=0:

c[0]=b[0]=7

i=1:

c[1]=b[1]=5

i=2:

c[2]=b[6 - (4 - 2 -1)] = b[6 - (2 -1)] = b[5]=1

i=3:

c[3]=b[6 - (4 -3 -1)] = b[6 - (1 -1)] = b[6 -0]=b[6], but indices go from 0 to m-1, so b[5]=1

Wait, that doesn't match the earlier pairing.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps for i >= n/2, c_i = b[m - (n - i -1)]

Wait, in python, lists are zero-indexed.

Let me try again:

for i in range(n):

if i < n//2:

c[i] = b[i]

else:

c[i] = b[m - (n - i -1)]

So, for i=0:

c[0]=b[0]=7

i=1:

c[1]=b[1]=5

i=2:

c[2]=b[6 - (4 -2 -1)]=b[6 - (2 -1)]=b[5]=1

i=3:

c[3]=b[6 - (4 -3 -1)]=b[6 - (1 -1)]=b[6], which is out of range.

Wait, indices go from 0 to m-1.

Alternatively, perhaps c[i] = b[m - (n - i)]

for i in range(n):

if i < n//2:

c[i] = b[i]

else:

c[i] = b[m - (n - i)]

So, for i=2:

c[2]=b[6 - (4 -2)]=b[6 -2]=b[4]=2

i=3:

c[3]=b[6 - (4 -3)]=b[6 -1]=b[5]=1

Then, a=[1,2,4,6], c=[7,5,2,1]

D=|1-7|+|2-5|+|4-2|+|6-1|=6+3+2+5=16, which matches the example.

Great, this seems to work.

Let me test it with another example.

Take the third example:

n=5, m=5

a:1,2,3,4,5

b:1,2,3,4,5 sorted descending:5,4,3,2,1

按照公式：

c[0]=b[0]=5

c[1]=b[1]=4

c[2]=b[5 - (5 -2)]=b[5 -3]=b[2]=3

c[3]=b[5 - (5 -3)]=b[5 -2]=b[3]=2

c[4]=b[5 - (5 -4)]=b[5 -1]=b[4]=1

So, c=[5,4,3,2,1]

D=|1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1|=4+2+0+2+4=12, which matches the third example's output.

Another example:

n=2, m=6

a:5,8

b:8,7,5,8,2,10 sorted descending:10,8,8,7,5,2

c[0]=b[0]=10

c[1]=b[6 - (2 -1)]=b[5]=2

So, c=[10,2]

D=|5-10|+|8-2|=5+6=11, which matches the fourth example's output.

Seems correct.

So, the approach is:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in descending order.

- For the first n//2 elements, c_i = b[i]

- For the remaining n - n//2 elements, c_i = b[m - (n - i -1)]

Wait, in code, it's easier to think of it as:

for i in range(n):

if i < n//2:

c[i] = b[i]

else:

c[i] = b[m - (n - i -1)]

Then, compute sum of |a[i] - c[i]| for all i.

This seems to work for the examples.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, considering that n and m can be up to 2e5, and the total sum of m over all test cases is up to 2e5, so overall time complexity should be O(T*(n log n + m log m)), which should be acceptable since T<=100 and n,m<=2e5, with sum of m over all test cases <=2e5.

Wait, but in the code, we need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Looking at the given code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

temp = -1

ans = []

a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]

b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]

for i in range(n):

if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):

temp = i

break

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))

if temp != -1:

for i in range(temp, n):

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))

print(sum(ans))

I need to check if this code implements the approach correctly.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Initialize temp=-1 and ans=[].

- Read a, sort it in ascending order, and take the first n elements.

- Read b, sort it in descending order, and take the first m elements.

- Iterate over i from 0 to n-1:

- If |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| > |a[i] - b[i]|, set temp=i and break.

- Else, append |a[i] - b[i]| to ans.

- If temp != -1, append |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| for i from temp to n-1.

- Print the sum of ans.

Wait, there are a few issues here.

First, in the line "b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]", since b is already of length m, sorting it in descending order and taking the first m elements is essentially just sorting b in descending order.

Similarly, a is sorted in ascending order.

Then, in the loop:

for i in range(n):

if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):

temp = i

break

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))

If temp != -1:

for i in range(temp, n):

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))

print(sum(ans))

Wait, what is the logic here?

It seems like it's trying to decide whether to switch to the alternative pairing based on the first i where the alternative pairing gives a larger difference.

But this seems flawed because it only checks the first such i and then switches for all subsequent i's, but it might not be optimal to switch for all remaining i's.

In the earlier manual calculation, for n=4, m=6:

a:1,2,4,6

b:7,5,3,3,2,1 (sorted descending)

According to the approach, c should be [7,5,2,1], which gives D=16.

But in the code:

Initialize ans=[]

temp=-1

for i=0:

|1- b[-(4-0)]=b[-4]=b[2]=3| = |1-3|=2

|1- b[0]=7|=|1-7|=6

Since 2 < 6, don't set temp, append 6 to ans.

ans=[6]

i=1:

|2 - b[-(4-1)]=b[-3]=b[3]=3|=|2-3|=1

|2 - b[1]=5|=|2-5|=3

1 < 3, don't set temp, append 3 to ans.

ans=[6,3]

i=2:

|4 - b[-(4-2)]=b[-2]=b[4]=2|=|4-2|=2

|4 - b[2]=3|=|4-3|=1

2 > 1, set temp=2 and break.

Then, for i=2 to 3:

append |4 - b[-(4-2)]=b[-2]=2|=|4-2|=2

append |6 - b[-(4-3)]=b[-1]=1|=|6-1|=5

So, ans=[6,3,2,5], sum=16, which is correct.

Seems like it works for this case.

Let me check another example.

Take n=5, m=5:

a:1,2,3,4,5

b:5,4,3,2,1 (sorted descending)

Proceed:

i=0:

|1 - b[-5]=1| = |1-1|=0

|1 - b[0]=5|=|1-5|=4

0 < 4, don't set temp, append 4

ans=[4]

i=1:

|2 - b[-4]=2|=|2-2|=0

|2 - b[1]=4|=|2-4|=2

0 < 2, don't set temp, append 2

ans=[4,2]

i=2:

|3 - b[-3]=3|=|3-3|=0

|3 - b[2]=3|=|3-3|=0

0 == 0, don't set temp, append 0

ans=[4,2,0]

i=3:

|4 - b[-2]=4|=|4-4|=0

|4 - b[3]=2|=|4-2|=2

0 < 2, don't set temp, append 2

ans=[4,2,0,2]

i=4:

|5 - b[-1]=5|=|5-5|=0

|5 - b[4]=1|=|5-1|=4

0 < 4, don't set temp, append 4

ans=[4,2,0,2,4], sum=12, which is correct.

Another example:

n=3, m=4

a:1,1,1

b:1,1,1,1 sorted descending:1,1,1,1

Proceed:

i=0:

|1 - b[-3]=1|=|1-1|=0

|1 - b[0]=1|=|1-1|=0

0 == 0, append 0

ans=[0]

i=1:

|1 - b[-2]=1|=|1-1|=0

|1 - b[1]=1|=|1-1|=0

0 == 0, append 0

ans=[0,0]

i=2:

|1 - b[-1]=1|=|1-1|=0

|1 - b[2]=1|=|1-1|=0

0 == 0, append 0

ans=[0,0,0], sum=0, which is correct.

Seems correct.

Another example:

n=1, m=6

a:3

b:2,7,10,1,1,5 sorted descending:10,7,5,2,1,1

Proceed:

i=0:

|3 - b[-1]=1|=|3-1|=2

|3 - b[0]=10|=|3-10|=7

2 < 7, don't set temp, append 7

ans=[7], sum=7, which matches the last example.

Seems correct.

So, the code seems to be implementing the approach correctly and producing the correct outputs for the examples.

Therefore, I would say that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
