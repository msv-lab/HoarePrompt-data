Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have n sticks, each with a length of 2 raised to the power of a certain number, specifically 2^{a_i} for each stick i. I need to choose exactly 3 sticks and form a non-degenerate triangle with them. A non-degenerate triangle means that the area is greater than 0, which in terms of stick lengths translates to the triangle inequality holding: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

First, I need to understand the properties of the lengths here. Since the lengths are of the form 2^{a_i}, and exponents are given as a_i, which are integers between 0 and n, I need to think about how these lengths compare to each other. One important thing about powers of 2 is that they are distinct and double each time the exponent increases by 1. So, if I have lengths like 2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, etc., each length is double the previous one.

Now, for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the two smaller lengths must be greater than the largest length. Given that the lengths are powers of 2, and they double each time, it's interesting to see when this condition holds.

Let me consider an example. Suppose I have sticks with a_i = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], so all sticks have length 2^1 = 2. In this case, any three sticks will form an equilateral triangle, so the number of ways is C(7,3) = 35. That matches the first example given.

Another example: a_i = [3,2,1,3], which correspond to lengths 8, 4, 2, 8. Now, let's see which triplets can form a triangle.

Possible triplets:

- 2,4,8: 2 + 4 = 6, which is less than 8 → cannot form a triangle.

- 2,4,8: same as above.

- 2,8,8: 2 + 8 = 10 > 8 → can form a triangle.

- 4,8,8: 4 + 8 = 12 > 8 → can form a triangle.

So, there are 2 valid triplets, matching the second example.

Another example: a_i = [1,2,3], lengths 2,4,8. As above, 2+4=6 < 8 → cannot form a triangle.

Last example: a_i = [1], only one stick, so no way to form a triangle.

From these examples, it seems that when we have multiple sticks of the same length, especially if they are the longest ones, we can form triangles under certain conditions.

Now, thinking about the general case. I need to find the number of triplets (i,j,k) where i < j < k, and the lengths 2^{a_i}, 2^{a_j}, 2^{a_k} satisfy the triangle inequality.

Given that the lengths are powers of 2, and powers of 2 are strictly increasing, I can think about sorting the exponents a_i in non-decreasing order. Then, for any triplet where a_i <= a_j <= a_k, the condition for forming a triangle is 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

Given the properties of exponents, if a_i < a_k, then 2^{a_i} < 2^{a_k}, and similarly for a_j. So, the sum 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} can only be greater than 2^{a_k} if a_j is close enough to a_k.

Wait a minute, let's think about this more carefully.

Suppose a_i <= a_j <= a_k. Then, 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

Since 2^{a_j} <= 2^{a_k}, the sum 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} can only be greater than 2^{a_k} if a_j is equal to a_k or very close.

But, since 2^{a_j} <= 2^{a_k}, and 2^{a_i} <= 2^{a_j}, the maximum sum is 2^{a_j} + 2^{a_j} = 2^{a_j + 1}. So, for the sum to be greater than 2^{a_k}, we need 2^{a_j + 1} > 2^{a_k}, which implies a_j + 1 > a_k, or a_k < a_j + 1.

But a_k >= a_j, since a_j <= a_k, so a_k can be a_j or a_j + 1.

If a_k = a_j, then 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_j}, which simplifies to 2^{a_i} > 0, which is always true since all lengths are positive. So, if a_i <= a_j = a_k, then it's always a valid triangle.

If a_k = a_j + 1, then 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_j + 1}. Let's see:

2^{a_j + 1} = 2 * 2^{a_j}.

So, 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2 * 2^{a_j} ⇒ 2^{a_i} > 2^{a_j}.

But since a_i <= a_j, 2^{a_i} <= 2^{a_j}, so the sum cannot be greater. Therefore, when a_k = a_j + 1, it's not possible to form a triangle.

If a_k > a_j + 1, it's even larger, so again, the sum 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} would be less than 2^{a_k}.

Therefore, the only way to form a triangle is when a_k = a_j, i.e., all three exponents are equal.

Wait, but in the second example, a_i = [3,2,1,3], which correspond to lengths 8,4,2,8.

Sorting exponents: 1,2,3,3.

So, possible triplets:

- (1,2,3): 2 + 4 = 6 > 8? No, 6 < 8 → invalid.

- (1,2,3): same as above.

- (1,3,3): 2 + 8 = 10 > 8 → valid.

- (2,3,3): 4 + 8 = 12 > 8 → valid.

So, in this case, even though not all exponents are equal, we can still form triangles.

This contradicts my earlier conclusion.

So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is incomplete.

Let me think again.

Suppose a_i <= a_j <= a_k.

Condition: 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

If a_j < a_k, then 2^{a_j} < 2^{a_k}, and 2^{a_i} <= 2^{a_j}, so the sum is less than or equal to 2^{a_j} + 2^{a_j} = 2^{a_j + 1}.

For the sum to be greater than 2^{a_k}, we need 2^{a_j + 1} > 2^{a_k}, which implies a_j + 1 > a_k.

So, a_k < a_j + 1.

But since a_k >= a_j, the only possibility is a_k = a_j or a_k = a_j + 1.

If a_k = a_j, then a_k = a_j, and the sum 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_j} holds as long as a_i >= 0, which it is, since a_i >= 0 implies 2^{a_i} >= 1.

If a_k = a_j + 1, then we need 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_j + 1} = 2 * 2^{a_j}.

This simplifies to 2^{a_i} > 2^{a_j}.

But since a_i <= a_j, 2^{a_i} <= 2^{a_j}, so this is impossible.

Therefore, the only way to have a valid triangle is when a_k = a_j.

Wait, but in the second example, we had a_k = a_j in some cases, and it worked.

So, generalizing, for any triplet where a_k = a_j, and a_i <= a_j, the condition holds.

Therefore, the number of valid triplets is the number of ways to choose two sticks with the same exponent a_j, and any third stick with a_i <= a_j.

But in the second example, when a_j = 3, and a_i = 1 or 2, but only when a_i = 3, it works, but in the example, it seems that a_i can be less than a_j as long as a_j = a_k.

Wait, no, in the second example, when a_j = a_k = 3, and a_i = 1 or 2, it works only when a_i + a_j > a_k, which in terms of exponents, as we saw, is not always the case.

Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, if a_k = a_j, then 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_j}, which simplifies to 2^{a_i} > 0, which is always true.

But in the second example, when a_i =1, a_j =3, a_k=3, 2 +8 >8, which is true.

Similarly, a_i=2, a_j=3, a_k=3, 4 +8 >8, which is true.

So, in this case, it works.

But in the third example, a_i=1,2,3, which are 2,4,8, and 2+4=6<8, so invalid.

So, perhaps there are more nuances here.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have exponents sorted in non-decreasing order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

For any triplet (i,j,k) with i < j < k, the condition is 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

Given that 2^{a_j} <= 2^{a_k}, the sum 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} can be at most 2^{a_j} + 2^{a_j} = 2^{a_j +1}.

So, for the sum to be greater than 2^{a_k}, we need 2^{a_j +1} > 2^{a_k}, which implies a_j +1 > a_k, or a_k < a_j +1.

But since a_k >= a_j, the only possibilities are a_k = a_j or a_k = a_j +1.

From earlier, if a_k = a_j +1, then 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_j +1}, which implies 2^{a_i} > 2^{a_j}, which can't happen since a_i <= a_j.

Therefore, the only possibility is a_k = a_j.

In this case, 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_j}, which simplifies to 2^{a_i} > 0, which is always true.

Therefore, any triplet where a_k = a_j, and a_i <= a_j, will form a valid triangle.

Hence, for each pair of sticks with the same exponent a_j = a_k, the number of valid triplets is equal to the number of sticks with exponents <= a_j, excluding the two sticks already chosen.

In other words, for each pair of sticks with exponent a_j, the number of valid triplets is equal to the total number of sticks with exponents <= a_j minus 2.

Wait, more carefully: for each pair of sticks with exponent a_j, the number of valid triplets is equal to the number of sticks with exponents <= a_j minus the two sticks already chosen.

But since a_j is the maximum exponent in the triplet, and a_i can be any exponent <= a_j, it's the number of sticks with exponents <= a_j minus the two sticks already chosen.

Wait, but in the sorted list, a_j is the second largest, and a_k is equal to a_j.

So, the number of sticks with exponents <= a_j is the total number of sticks up to a_j.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of frequency counts.

Let me count the frequency of each exponent.

Let freq[a] be the number of sticks with exponent a.

Then, for each a, the number of ways to choose two sticks with exponent a is C(freq[a], 2).

For each such pair, the number of sticks with exponents <= a is the cumulative sum up to a.

But, since the pair itself is included in this cumulative sum, I need to subtract 2 to exclude the pair sticks.

Wait, no, the pair sticks are already chosen, so the third stick can be any stick with exponent <= a, except the two sticks already chosen.

So, the number of valid triplets for each pair of sticks with exponent a is (cumulative sum up to a) - 2.

Therefore, for each a, the contribution to the total number of triplets is C(freq[a], 2) * (cumulative sum up to a - 2).

But, I need to make sure that a is the maximum exponent in the triplet, so the third stick must have exponent <= a.

Wait, but in the earlier reasoning, a_k = a_j = a, so a is the maximum exponent.

Therefore, for each pair of sticks with exponent a, the number of valid third sticks is the number of sticks with exponents <= a minus the two sticks already chosen.

So, it's (number of sticks with exponents <= a) - 2.

Therefore, if I compute the cumulative sum up to a, say cum[a], which is the total number of sticks with exponents <= a, then for each a, the contribution is C(freq[a], 2) * (cum[a] - 2).

But, I need to make sure that this doesn't overcount or miss something.

Let me verify with the second example:

a_i = [1,2,1,3], sorted: [1,1,2,3].

cum[1] = 2 (sticks with a <=1)

cum[2] = 3 (sticks with a <=2)

cum[3] = 4 (sticks with a <=3)

For a=1: freq[1]=2, C(2,2)=1, contribution =1 * (2 -2) =0

For a=2: freq[2]=1, C(1,2)=0, contribution =0

For a=3: freq[3]=1, C(1,2)=0, contribution =0

Total triplets =0, but in the example, it's 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, my formula is incorrect.

What's wrong here?

Ah, I think I missed that for a=3, cum[3]=4, and C(1,2)=0, but in reality, there are triplets involving a=3 and lower exponents.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to iterate through the exponents in sorted order and for each exponent a, consider it as the maximum in the triplet, and count the number of pairs with exponents <=a.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach.

Let me think again.

Suppose I sort the exponents in non-decreasing order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

For each a_k, I can fix it as the largest exponent in the triplet, and find the number of pairs (i,j) with i < j < k and a_i <= a_j <= a_k, such that 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}.

From earlier reasoning, this is only possible if a_j = a_k.

Therefore, for each a_k, the number of valid pairs is the number of pairs (i,j) where a_j = a_k and i < j < k.

But, since a_j = a_k, and a_j <= a_k, this simplifies to counting the number of sticks with a = a_k among the first k-1 sticks.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is getting too complicated.

Let me think about cumulative counts.

Let me compute the frequency of each a_i.

Then, for each a, the number of triplets where a is the maximum exponent is C(freq[a],2) * (cum[a] - freq[a]).

Wait, no.

Actually, for each pair of sticks with a_j = a_k = a, the third stick can be any stick with a_i <= a, except the two sticks already chosen.

So, the number of such triplets is C(freq[a],2) * (cum[a] - freq[a]).

Because cum[a] is the total number of sticks with exponents <= a, and freq[a] is the number of sticks with exponent a.

So, C(freq[a],2) is the number of ways to choose two sticks with a_j = a_k = a.

Then, the number of third sticks is cum[a] - freq[a], because we exclude the two sticks already chosen.

Wait, but cum[a] includes all sticks with exponents <= a, including those with a < a.

But in the earlier example, this doesn't match.

Wait, in the second example:

a_i = [1,2,1,3], sorted: [1,1,2,3].

freq[1]=2, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1

cum[1]=2, cum[2]=3, cum[3]=4

For a=1: C(2,2)=1 * (2 - 2)=0 → 0

For a=2: C(1,2)=0 * (3 -1)=0 → 0

For a=3: C(1,2)=0 * (4 -1)=0 → 0

Total: 0, but example says 2.

So, my formula is incorrect.

What's wrong?

Wait, perhaps I need to add C(freq[a],3) for the case where all three sticks have a_j = a_k = a_i = a.

In the earlier example, a=3 has freq=1, so C(1,3)=0.

But in the second example, there are two triplets: (1,2,4) and (1,3,4), which correspond to sticks with exponents [1,2,3] and [1,3,4], but according to my earlier reasoning, only the triplets where a_j = a_k =3 should be considered.

Wait, but in the second example, the valid triplets are (1,3,4) and (2,3,4), which correspond to exponents [1,3,3] and [2,3,3].

So, for a=3, freq=1, but in the triplet, a_j = a_k =3, but a_i can be 1 or 2.

But according to my formula, for a=3, C(1,2)=0, so no contribution.

This suggests that my formula is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that a_j and a_k are both equal to a, and a_i can be any exponent <= a, but excluding the two sticks already chosen.

But in the second example, for a=3, freq[3]=1, so there are no two sticks with a=3 to form a pair.

But in the example, triplets (1,3,4) and (2,3,4) are considered valid, which means that a_j =3 and a_k=3, but a_i=1 or a_i=2.

But according to my earlier formula, since freq[3]=1, C(1,2)=0, so no contribution.

This indicates that my formula is incomplete.

Perhaps I need to consider that a_j and a_k are both equal to a, but a_i can be any exponent <=a, excluding the two sticks already chosen.

But in the second example, for a=3, there's only one stick with a=3, so no pair can be formed.

So, perhaps I need to consider that for a given a, if freq[a] >=2, then the number of valid triplets is C(freq[a],2) * (cum[a] - freq[a]).

But in the second example, freq[3]=1, so no contribution, which doesn't match the example.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider triplets where a_j =a_k =a, and a_i can be any exponent <=a, excluding the two sticks already chosen.

But in the second example, a=3 has only one stick, so no such pair exists.

However, in the example, there are two valid triplets involving a=3.

So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Let me try a different approach.

Let me iterate through all possible triplets and count those that satisfy the triangle inequality.

But with n up to 3*10^5, and t up to 10^4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 3*10^5, this would be too slow.

So, I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of exponents.

Given that the lengths are powers of 2, which are distinct and double each time, perhaps there's a pattern or a mathematical formula to count the valid triplets efficiently.

Let me consider that for three lengths 2^x, 2^y, 2^z, with x <= y <= z, the condition for forming a triangle is 2^x + 2^y > 2^z.

Given that 2^y <= 2^z, the sum 2^x + 2^y is at most 2^{y+1}.

So, for 2^x + 2^y > 2^z to hold, we need 2^{y+1} > 2^z, which implies y +1 > z, or z < y +1.

But since z >= y, the only possibility is z = y or z = y +1.

From earlier, z cannot be y +1 because 2^x + 2^y > 2^{y+1} would require 2^x > 2^y, which is impossible since x <= y.

Therefore, the only possibility is z = y.

So, z = y.

In this case, 2^x + 2^y > 2^y, which simplifies to 2^x > 0, which is always true.

Therefore, any triplet where the two larger exponents are equal will form a valid triangle.

Hence, the number of valid triplets is equal to the number of ways to choose two sticks with the same exponent and a third stick with any exponent less than or equal to that exponent.

Wait, but in the second example, when a=3 has only one stick, how can I choose two sticks with a=3?

In that case, it's impossible, so there should be no triplets, but according to the example, there are two valid triplets.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the two larger sticks have the same exponent, and the smallest stick can be any with exponent <= that exponent.

In the second example, the exponents are [1,1,2,3].

Sorted: 1,1,2,3.

Possible triplets where the two larger sticks have the same exponent:

- Choose two sticks with a=1: but a=1 is not larger than a=2 or a=3.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the two larger sticks in the triplet.

So, for a triplet (a,b,c) with a <= b <= c:

- c = b.

So, in the second example:

- Triplets where c = b =3:

  - a can be 1 or 2.

  - So, triplets (1,3,3) and (2,3,3).

  - But in the input, a_i = [1,2,1,3], so sticks with exponents 1,2,1,3.

  - So, indices (1,3,4) and (2,3,4).

- Triplets where c = b =1:

  - But c must be the largest, and a=1, b=1, c=1.

  - But in this case, a=1, b=1, c=1.

  - But in the input, there are only two sticks with a=1, so only one such triplet: (1,2,4), but a=1, a=1, a=3, which doesn't satisfy c=b=1.

  - Wait, no, sorted it's a=1, a=1, a=2, a=3.

  - So, triplets where c=b=1 are not possible because c must be the largest in the triplet.

Therefore, only triplets where c=b=3 are valid, but in the input, there's only one stick with a=3, so it's impossible to choose two sticks with a=3.

But according to the example, there are two valid triplets.

This suggests that my reasoning is flawed.

Perhaps I need to consider that when c=b, even if there's only one stick with a=b=c, but in the triplet, the sticks are chosen by indices, and multiple sticks can have the same exponent.

Wait, in the second example, a_i = [3,2,1,3], which correspond to exponents 3,2,1,3.

So, sorted exponents: 1,2,3,3.

So, for triplets where c=b=3, and a can be 1 or 2.

So, triplets (1,3,4) and (2,3,4), which correspond to exponents [1,3,3] and [2,3,3].

So, even though there's only one stick with a=3, but since there are multiple sticks with a=3, specifically two sticks with a=3 (indices 1 and 4), we can choose these two sticks as b and c, and pair them with a stick with a <=3.

But in this case, a=1 or a=2.

Wait, but in the triplet (1,3,4), a=1, b=3, c=3.

Similarly, (2,3,4): a=2, b=3, c=3.

So, in this case, even though only two sticks have a=3, we can choose two sticks with a=3 as b and c, and pair them with a stick with a <=3.

Therefore, for each pair of sticks with a=3, we can pair them with any stick with a <=3, excluding the two sticks already chosen.

In this case, for a=3, freq[3]=2.

C(2,2)=1.

cum[3]=4.

So, number of triplets for a=3 is 1 * (4 - 2) = 2, which matches the example.

Therefore, the correct formula is:

For each a, the number of triplets is C(freq[a],2) * (cum[a] - freq[a]).

In this example:

For a=1: C(2,2)=1 * (2 - 2)=0 → 0

For a=2: C(1,2)=0 * (3 -1)=0 → 0

For a=3: C(2,2)=1 * (4 - 2)=2 → 2

Total: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches the example.

Similarly, in the first example, a_i = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], sorted
