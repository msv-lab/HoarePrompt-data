Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. I can perform an operation any number of times, which is: choose any k cards that all have the same number, and exchange them for k-1 cards, each with any number I choose.

The goal is to find the minimum number of cards I can have in my hand at the end of this process.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. I can pick k cards with the same number and replace them with k-1 cards of any numbers I choose. So, essentially, I'm reducing the number of cards by 1 each time I do this operation, since I'm replacing k cards with k-1 cards.

But there's more to it because I can choose the numbers on the new cards, and they can be anything I want. This flexibility might allow me to set up future operations.

Let me look at the example provided:

Input:

7

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

1 10

7

7 2

4 2 1 100 5 2 3

10 4

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

5 2

3 8 1 48 7

6 2

10 20 30 10 20 40

6 3

10 20 30 10 20 40

Output:

2

1

1

3

5

1

6

Looking at the first test case:

n=5, k=3, cards: 4,1,1,4,4

From the description, it says that the sequence of operations displayed is optimal, and the answer is 2.

So, in this case, with n=5 and k=3, I can perform one operation by selecting three 4's, and replacing them with two cards of any number, say two 4's again. Then, I have two 4's and two 1's. I can't perform any more operations because I don't have three cards with the same number. So, I'm left with two cards.

Wait, but according to the operation, when I select three 4's and replace them with two cards of any number, say two 4's, then I still have two 4's and two 1's. I can't perform another operation because I don't have three of the same number. So, the minimum is two cards.

Another way: after replacing three 4's with two 4's, I have two 4's and two 1's. I can't perform any more operations. So, the answer is 2.

Second test case:

n=1, k=10, cards: 7

I can't perform any operations because I don't have 10 cards to exchange. So, I'm left with 1 card.

Third test case:

n=7, k=2, cards: 4,2,1,100,5,2,3

I can perform operations on pairs of the same number. Here, I have two 2's. I can exchange them for one card of any number, say 2 again. Then, I have cards: 4,2,1,100,5,2,3 -> after exchanging two 2's, I have 4,2,1,100,5,3. Now, I have only one pair of 2's, but after exchanging, I have no pairs left. So, the minimum is 1 card.

Wait, but the output is 1. Maybe I can reduce it further.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to exchange the two 2's for one card of a new number, say 4. Then, I have 4,1,100,5,3,4. Now, I have two 4's. I can exchange them for one card, say 4 again. Then, I have 4,1,100,5,3 -> no pairs left. So, minimum is 1 card.

Fourth test case:

n=10, k=4, cards: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

I have ten 1's. I can perform operations by selecting four 1's and replacing them with three 1's. Each time, I reduce the count by one.

So, starting with 10 cards:

- Select four 1's, replace with three 1's -> 9 cards

- Select four 1's, replace with three 1's -> 8 cards

- Select four 1's, replace with three 1's -> 7 cards

- Select four 1's, replace with three 1's -> 6 cards

- Select four 1's, replace with three 1's -> 5 cards

- Select four 1's, replace with three 1's -> 4 cards

- Select four 1's, replace with three 1's -> 3 cards

Now, I can't perform any more operations because I don't have four 1's. So, the minimum is 3 cards.

Fifth test case:

n=5, k=2, cards: 3,8,1,48,7

I have no pairs, so I can't perform any operations. So, the minimum is 5 cards.

Sixth test case:

n=6, k=2, cards: 10,20,30,10,20,40

I have two 10's and two 20's.

- Exchange two 10's for one card, say 10.

- Now, cards are: 10,20,30,20,40

- Exchange two 20's for one card, say 20.

- Now, cards are: 10,20,30,40

- No pairs left, so minimum is 1 card.

Wait, but the output is 1, but I have four cards left. Maybe I can do better.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to exchange two 10's for one card, say 20.

- Then, cards are: 20,20,30,20,40

- Now, I have three 20's.

- Exchange two of them for one 20.

- Now, cards are: 20,30,20,40

- Exchange two 20's for one 20.

- Now, cards are: 20,30,40

- No pairs left, so minimum is 1 card.

Wait, but I still have three cards left. Maybe I need to choose differently.

Alternatively, exchange two 20's for one 30.

- Then, cards are: 10,30,30,40

- Exchange two 30's for one 30.

- Now, cards are: 10,30,40

- No pairs left, so still 3 cards.

It seems that 1 is the answer, but I'm not seeing how to get to 1 card.

Maybe I can be more strategic in choosing which cards to exchange.

Let's try:

- Exchange two 10's for one 20.

- Now, cards: 20,20,30,20,40

- Exchange three 20's for two 20's.

Wait, but k=2, so I can only exchange pairs.

Wait, maybe I misread the operation.

Operation: choose k cards with the same number, exchange them for k-1 cards of any numbers.

So, with k=2, I choose two cards with the same number and replace them with one card of any number.

So, in the sixth test case:

- Start with: 10,20,30,10,20,40

- Choose two 10's, replace with one, say 10.

- Now: 10,20,30,20,40

- Choose two 20's, replace with one, say 20.

- Now: 10,20,30,40

- No more pairs, so minimum is 1 card.

Wait, but I have four cards left, but the output is 1. Maybe I can reduce it further.

Perhaps I can choose to exchange different pairs.

- Start with: 10,20,30,10,20,40

- Exchange two 10's for one 20.

- Now: 20,20,30,20,40

- Exchange three 20's for two 20's.

Wait, but k=2, so I can only exchange pairs.

- Exchange two 20's for one 20.

- Now: 20,30,20,40

- Exchange two 20's for one 20.

- Now: 20,30,40

- No pairs left, so minimum is 1 card.

Wait, but I still have three cards left. Maybe the answer is 1, but I don't see how to get to one card.

Perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Looking back at the problem, it says "each of which can have any number you choose". So, when I exchange k cards, I get k-1 cards back, each can be any number I choose.

So, in the sixth test case:

- Start with: 10,20,30,10,20,40

- Exchange two 10's for one card, say 20.

- Now: 20,20,30,20,40

- Exchange three 20's for two 20's.

Wait, but k=2, so I can only exchange pairs.

Wait, maybe I can exchange two 20's for one 20, twice.

- First exchange: two 20's -> one 20.

- Now: 20,30,20,40

- Second exchange: two 20's -> one 20.

- Now: 20,30,40

- No pairs left.

So, I'm left with three cards: 20,30,40.

I can't see how to get to one card from here. Maybe the answer should be 3, but the output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to exchange two different pairs in a way that allows further operations.

Let's try a different approach:

- Start with: 10,20,30,10,20,40

- Exchange two 10's for one 20.

- Now: 20,20,30,20,40

- Exchange two 20's for one 20.

- Now: 20,30,20,40

- Exchange two 20's for one 20.

- Now: 20,30,40

- No pairs left.

Still, three cards.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively:

- Start with: 10,20,30,10,20,40

- Exchange two 10's for one 10.

- Now: 10,20,30,20,40

- Exchange two 20's for one 20.

- Now: 10,20,30,40

- No pairs left.

Still, four cards.

Wait, but the output is 1, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Maybe I can choose to exchange cards in a way that creates new pairs.

- Start with: 10,20,30,10,20,40

- Exchange two 10's for one 20.

- Now: 20,20,30,20,40

- Exchange three 20's for two 20's.

Wait, but k=2, so I can only exchange pairs.

- Exchange two 20's for one 20.

- Now: 20,30,20,40

- Exchange two 20's for one 20.

- Now: 20,30,40

- No pairs left.

Still, three cards.

Hmm.

Looking back at the problem, it says "each of which can have any number you choose". So, when I exchange two cards, I can choose the number on the new card.

Maybe I can choose to set the new card to a number that already exists.

Wait, in the sixth test case, n=6, k=2, cards:10,20,30,10,20,40

I can exchange two 10's for one 20.

Now: 20,20,30,20,40

Then, exchange three 20's for two 20's.

Wait, but k=2, so I can only exchange pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can exchange two 20's for one 30.

Now: 30,30,40

Then, exchange two 30's for one 30.

Now: 30,40

Then, exchange two different cards, but they don't have the same number, so I can't.

Wait, I can only exchange cards that have the same number.

So, from 30 and 40, I can't exchange them because they don't have the same number.

So, I'm left with two cards.

But the output is 1, so maybe there's a better sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to exchange two 20's for one 40.

Then: 40,30,20,40

Now, I have two 40's.

Exchange two 40's for one 40.

Now: 40,30

Can't exchange anymore.

Still, two cards.

Still not matching the output of 1.

I must be missing something.

Looking at the seventh test case:

n=6, k=3, cards:10,20,30,10,20,40

Here, k=3, so I need to select three cards with the same number to exchange.

Looking at the cards: 10,20,30,10,20,40

I have two 10's and two 20's, but no three of the same number.

So, I can't perform any operations.

Thus, the minimum is 6 cards.

Which matches the output of 6.

But in the sixth test case, with k=2, I was able to reduce to 1 card, according to the output.

But I can't see how.

Wait, maybe with k=2, I can keep exchanging pairs until I'm left with one card.

Wait, in the second test case: n=1, k=10, cards:7

I can't perform any operations because n < k.

So, minimum is 1 card.

In the third test case: n=7, k=2, cards:4,2,1,100,5,2,3

I can exchange the two 2's for one 2.

Now: 4,2,1,100,5,3

No more pairs, so minimum is 1 card.

But in reality, I have six cards left, but the output is 1.

Wait, perhaps the answer is the number of distinct numbers left after all operations.

But in the fourth test case: n=10, k=4, cards:1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

I can perform operations until I'm left with 3 cards, which matches the output of 3.

Wait, perhaps the answer is the remainder when n is divided by (k-1).

Wait, in the first test case: n=5, k=3 -> 5 % (3-1) = 5 % 2 = 1, but the output is 2.

No, that doesn't match.

In the fourth test case: n=10, k=4 -> 10 % 3 = 1, but the output is 3.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's n - (n // k).

But for n=5, k=3: 5 - (5//3) = 5 - 1 = 4, which is not matching the output of 2.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's n - (n / (k-1)).

For n=5, k=3: 5 - (5 / 2) = 5 - 2.5 = 2.5, but output is 2.

Wait, but output is integer.

Maybe floor division.

n - (n // (k-1))

For n=5, k=3: 5 - (5 // 2) = 5 - 2 = 3, which is not matching output of 2.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's n - (n - 1) // (k - 1)

Wait, not sure.

Let me think differently.

Each operation reduces the number of cards by (k - (k-1)) = 1.

So, theoretically, I can reduce the number of cards by performing as many operations as possible.

But I need to consider that I can only perform operations on groups of k cards with the same number.

So, it's not just about reducing by 1 each time, but about how many operations I can perform based on the frequency of each number.

I need to model this properly.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

For each number, if it appears f times, then the number of operations I can perform on it is f // k.

Each operation reduces the count by (k - (k-1)) = 1.

Wait, no, each operation reduces the count by k - (k-1) = 1.

Wait, but in reality, each operation replaces k cards with k-1 cards, so the net reduction is 1 card.

But I need to consider that I can choose to set the new cards to any number, which might allow me to create new groups for future operations.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to model this as a greedy algorithm where I repeatedly perform operations on the most frequent numbers.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Looking back at the fourth test case: n=10, k=4, all cards are 1.

I can perform operations until I'm left with 3 cards.

Each operation reduces the count by 1, and I can perform operations as long as there are at least k cards with the same number.

So, starting with 10 cards, I can perform 10 // 4 = 2 operations, reducing by 2, so 10 - 2 = 8 cards left.

Wait, but in reality, after first operation: 10 - 1 = 9 cards.

Wait, no, each operation replaces k cards with k-1 cards, so the reduction is by 1 card each time.

So, starting with 10 cards, I can perform 10 - 3 operations, since each operation reduces by 1, until I'm left with 3 cards.

Which matches the output of 3.

Similarly, in the first test case: n=5, k=3.

I can perform 5 - 2 = 3 operations, but wait, no.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, with n=5, k=3, I can perform one operation, reducing to 4 cards.

Then, I can't perform another operation because I don't have three cards with the same number.

Wait, but in the example, they say the answer is 2.

So, perhaps I need to consider the frequency of each number.

In the first test case: cards are 4,1,1,4,4.

So, frequency of 4 is 3, frequency of 1 is 2.

I can perform one operation on the three 4's, replacing them with two 4's.

Now, I have two 4's and two 1's.

I can't perform any more operations because I don't have three of the same number.

So, I'm left with four cards, but the output is 2.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace the three 4's with two other cards, say two 1's.

Then, I have two 1's and two 1's, totaling four 1's.

Then, I can perform another operation on three 1's, replacing them with two 1's.

Now, I have two 1's.

I can't perform any more operations.

So, I'm left with two cards.

This matches the output of 2.

So, by choosing to replace the three 4's with two 1's, I can create a new group of four 1's, and then perform another operation on three of them.

Thus, reducing the total cards to two.

This shows that the choice of numbers for the new cards is important and can affect the final result.

So, I need to think about how to strategically choose the numbers for the new cards to minimize the final number of cards.

This seems complex.

Is there a pattern or formula that can be applied?

Looking at the outputs:

2

1

1

3

5

1

6

I need to find a general approach.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

For each number, if it appears f times, then the number of operations I can perform on it is f // k.

Each operation reduces the count by 1, as I replace k cards with k-1 cards.

But I can choose the numbers for the new cards, which can be any number.

This flexibility allows me to create new groups for future operations.

So, perhaps I should aim to create groups that allow more operations.

In the first test case, by choosing to replace three 4's with two 1's, I created a larger group of 1's, allowing another operation.

So, the strategy might be to always replace the exchanged cards with the number that currently has the highest frequency.

Wait, but in the first test case, replacing three 4's with two 1's increased the frequency of 1's, which allowed another operation.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, I can keep replacing four 1's with three 1's, reducing the count by one each time, until I'm left with three 1's.

In the second test case, n=1, k=10, only one card, can't perform any operations, so minimum is 1.

In the third test case, n=7, k=2, cards:4,2,1,100,5,2,3.

Frequency: 2 appears twice, others once.

I can perform operations on the two 2's, replacing them with one 2.

Now, I have six cards: 4,2,1,100,5,3.

No pairs left, so minimum is 1 card.

But according to the output, it's 1.

Wait, but in reality, I have six cards left.

Wait, maybe the answer is the number of distinct numbers left after all operations.

But in this case, I have six distinct numbers: 4,2,1,100,5,3.

But the output is 1.

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum number of distinct numbers.

But in this case, I can perform operations to reduce the number of cards, but not necessarily the distinct numbers.

I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I model the problem as reducing the total number of cards by performing operations as much as possible.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1.

But I can only perform an operation if there are at least k cards with the same number.

So, the maximum number of operations I can perform is limited by the frequency of the most frequent number.

Wait, but in the first test case, I performed two operations: first on three 4's, then on three 1's, but in reality, after the first operation, I only have two 1's, which is not enough for another operation.

Wait, no, in the sequence I did earlier, I replaced three 4's with two 1's, making four 1's in total, then performed another operation on three of them.

So, in total, I performed two operations, reducing the total cards from five to three, but according to the example, the answer is two.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, in the first operation, replace three 4's with two 1's: now have two 1's and two 1's (from the original two 1's plus the two new 1's), totaling four 1's.

Then, perform another operation on three of these four 1's, replacing them with two 1's.

Now, I have two 1's left.

Total operations: two, reducing the total cards from five to three, but according to the example, the answer is two.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after each operation, the new cards can be used in subsequent operations.

Yes, that seems to be the case.

So, perhaps the minimum number of cards is n - (number of operations performed).

And the number of operations is maximized based on the frequencies and the ability to create new groups.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to find the maximum number of operations I can perform, considering that each operation reduces the total cards by one, and that I can perform operations as long as there exists a number with at least k cards.

But since I can choose the numbers for the new cards, I can strategically create new groups for future operations.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I should look for a mathematical formula or a greedy approach.

Let me consider the frequency of the most frequent number.

If the frequency of the most frequent number is greater than or equal to k, then I can perform operations on it.

Each operation reduces its frequency by k and increases the frequency of some other number by k-1.

I can choose which number to increase.

So, I can choose to increase the frequency of the number that currently has the highest frequency, to allow more operations.

Wait, but in practice, it might not always be the best strategy.

Alternatively, maybe I should aim to equalize the frequencies in a way that minimizes the total number of cards.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I try to minimize the total number of cards by performing as many operations as possible.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by one.

So, the minimum number of cards is n - m, where m is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

The question is, what is m?

m is the total number of operations I can perform, given that each operation requires k cards with the same number, and after each operation, I have k-1 new cards to consider.

This seems like a complex dependency.

Maybe I can model this using a greedy algorithm where I always perform operations on the number with the highest frequency.

Let's try that with the first test case:

n=5, k=3

Frequencies: 4:3, 1:2

- Perform operation on three 4's, replace with two 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:4

- Perform operation on three 1's, replace with two 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:3

- Perform operation on three 1's, replace with two 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:2

- Can't perform any more operations.

Total operations: 2, so minimum cards: 5 - 2 = 3, but the example says 2.

Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Let's retrace:

- Start: 4:3, 1:2

- Operation 1: replace three 4's with two 1's -> now 1:4

- Operation 2: replace three 1's with two 1's -> now 1:3

- Operation 3: replace three 1's with two 1's -> now 1:2

- Can't perform more operations.

So, total operations: 3, minimum cards: 5 - 3 = 2.

Yes, now it matches the example output of 2.

I must have miscounted earlier.

So, in this case, m=3, n=5, minimum cards=2.

In the fourth test case: n=10, k=4, all cards are 1.

- Perform operation on four 1's, replace with three 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:7

- Perform operation on four 1's, replace with three 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:4

- Perform operation on four 1's, replace with three 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:3

- Can't perform more operations.

Total operations: 3, minimum cards: 10 - 3 = 7, but according to the example, it's 3.

Wait, discrepancy again.

Wait, perhaps I need to perform operations until I can't perform any more.

Starting with 10 cards all 1's, k=4.

- Operation 1: replace four 1's with three 1's -> 7 cards

- Operation 2: replace four 1's with three 1's -> 4 cards

- Operation 3: replace four 1's with three 1's -> 3 cards

Now, can't perform more operations.

So, minimum cards: 3, which matches the example.

Earlier, I thought m=3, n=10, minimum=7, which was wrong.

Wait, no, 10 - 3 = 7, but example says 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to perform operations until I can't perform any more, and the remaining cards are n - m, where m is the number of operations performed.

In this case, m=3, n=10, n - m = 7, but example says 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after each operation, the number of cards is reduced by one, but the new cards added are k-1 cards.

Wait, yes, each operation reduces the total cards by one, since k cards are replaced by k-1 cards.

So, total reduction is m, so minimum cards is n - m.

In the first test case, n=5, m=3, minimum=2.

In the fourth test case, n=10, m=7, minimum=3.

Seems consistent.

Now, how to calculate m, the maximum number of operations I can perform.

Each operation requires k cards with the same number.

I can perform operations as long as there exists a number with at least k cards.

I need to maximize m, the number of operations.

Given that after each operation, I have k-1 new cards of some number, which can be used in future operations.

This seems like a process where I need to repeatedly find groups of k cards with the same number and replace them, reducing the total cards by one each time.

To maximize m, I need to perform as many such operations as possible.

This seems similar to finding how many times I can remove k cards from the most frequent number and add k-1 cards back, updating the frequencies accordingly.

This can be modeled by iterating over the frequencies, sorting them in descending order, and repeatedly performing operations on the highest frequency until no more operations can be performed.

But this sounds time-consuming for large n and t up to 500.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

For each number, I can perform f // k operations on it, where f is its frequency.

Each operation reduces its frequency by k and adds k-1 cards of some number.

But since I can choose the number for the new cards, I can strategically add them to the number that currently has the highest frequency, to allow more operations.

This seems like a greedy approach where I always try to perform operations on the number with the highest frequency, and add the new cards to the number that will allow the most operations.

But implementing this seems complicated.

Is there a simpler way?

Looking at the problem again, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum frequency.

If the maximum frequency is greater than or equal to k, I can perform operations until the frequency is less than k.

In the first test case, frequencies: 4:3, 1:2.

- Since 3 >= 3, perform operation on 4's: replace three 4's with two 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:4.

- 4 >= 3, perform operation on 1's: replace three 1's with two 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:3.

- 3 >= 3, perform operation on 1's: replace three 1's with two 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:2.

- 2 < 3, can't perform any more operations.

Total operations: 3, minimum cards: 5 - 3 = 2.

In the fourth test case: frequencies: 1:10.

- 10 >= 4, perform operation: replace four 1's with three 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:7.

- 7 >= 4, perform operation: replace four 1's with three 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:4.

- 4 >= 4, perform operation: replace four 1's with three 1's.

Now, frequencies: 1:3.

- 3 < 4, can't perform any more operations.

Total operations: 3, minimum cards: 10 - 3 = 7, but according to the example, it's 3.

Wait, discrepancy again.

Wait, in the example, the answer is 3, but according to this, it should be 7.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when I perform an operation, I reduce the frequency of one number by k and increase another by k-1.

So, in the fourth test case:

- Start: 1:10

- Operation 1: replace four 1's with three 1's -> frequencies: 1:7

- Operation 2: replace four 1's with three 1's -> frequencies: 1:4

- Operation
