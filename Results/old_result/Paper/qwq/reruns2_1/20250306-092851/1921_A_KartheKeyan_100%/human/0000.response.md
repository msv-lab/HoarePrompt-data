Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the four corners of a square, but they're in random order. I need to find the area of this square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed that the input forms a valid square with positive area.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligned with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should reflect that.

Given four points, I need to figure out which ones are opposite corners of the square. Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the coordinates should make it easy to identify the min and max x and y values.

Wait, actually, since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the coordinates of the corners should consist of all possible combinations of two distinct x-values and two distinct y-values. For example, if the x-values are a and b, and y-values are c and d, then the four points should be (a,c), (a,d), (b,c), and (b,d).

So, to find the area, I just need to find the difference between the x-values and the difference between the y-values, square those differences, and that should give me the area.

But wait, since it's a square, the length of the sides should be equal, so the difference between the x-values should be equal to the difference between the y-values.

Wait, no, the problem says it's a square, so the sides are equal, and angles are right angles, and sides are parallel to the axes. So, the distance between the x-coordinates should be equal to the distance between the y-coordinates.

But, in the example input, the first test case is:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

So, the x-values are 1 and 4, y-values are 2 and 5. The difference in x is 3, difference in y is 3, so the side length is 3, and area is 9, which matches the first output.

The second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

x-values: -1 and 1, y-values: -1 and 1. Difference is 2, area is 4, which matches.

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

x-values: 45 and 17, y-values: 11 and 39. Difference in x is 28, difference in y is 28, area is 784, which matches.

So, my approach should be:

1. Collect the four points.

2. Extract the unique x-values and y-values.

3. Compute the difference between the two unique x-values and the two unique y-values.

4. Since it's a square, these differences should be equal.

5. Compute the area by squaring this difference.

But, in the code provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Let me look at the given program.

The function func is defined, and it seems to handle multiple test cases, as indicated by the input n.

Inside the loop for each test case, it reads four coordinates and stores them in a list called coord.

Then, it sorts the coordinates. Since coord is a list of tuples, sorting them will arrange them in increasing order of x, and then y.

After sorting, it calculates p1 and p2, which are the squared distances between the first two points and the last two points.

Then, it takes the square roots of p1 and p2 and multiplies them to get the area, and prints the rounded result.

Wait, this seems incorrect.

In a square with sides parallel to the axes, the sides are either horizontal or vertical. So, the distance between (a,c) and (a,d) is |d-c|, and between (a,c) and (b,c) is |b-a|.

Since it's a square, |b-a| should equal |d-c|.

The area would be |b-a|^2.

In the given code, it's calculating the distances between the first two sorted points and the last two sorted points, taking their square roots (which would be the side lengths), and then multiplying them to get the area.

But, in a square, all sides are equal, so multiplying two side lengths would give the area only if it's a rectangle, but for a square, it's just side^2.

However, since it's a square, side1 = side2, so side1 * side2 = side^2, which is correct.

But, is this the right way to calculate the sides?

Let's consider the sorting.

When you sort the coordinates, you get them in order of increasing x, and then y.

So, for example, in the first test case:

Points are (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Sorted would be:

(1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

So, p1 is distance between (1,5) and (1,2): which is 3^2 = 9

p2 is distance between (4,5) and (4,2): which is 3^2 = 9

Then, math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2) = 3 * 3 = 9, which is correct.

Similarly, in the second test case:

Points are (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

Sorted would be:

(-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)

p1 = distance between (-1,1) and (-1,-1): 2^2 = 4

p2 = distance between (1,1) and (1,-1): 2^2 = 4

Then, sqrt(p1)*sqrt(p2) = 2*2 = 4, which is correct.

Third test case:

(17,11), (17,39), (45,11), (45,39)

Sorted:

(17,11), (17,39), (45,11), (45,39)

p1 = distance between (17,39) and (17,11): 28^2 = 784

p2 = distance between (45,39) and (45,11): 28^2 = 784

Then, sqrt(p1)*sqrt(p2) = 28*28 = 784, which is correct.

So, in all these cases, it's giving the correct answer.

But is this approach general enough?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose the points are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)

Sorted: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)

p1 = distance between (0,2) and (0,0): 2^2 = 4

p2 = distance between (2,2) and (2,0): 2^2 = 4

Then, sqrt(4)*sqrt(4) = 2*2 = 4, which is correct.

Another example:

Points (3,4), (3,7), (6,4), (6,7)

Sorted: (3,4), (3,7), (6,4), (6,7)

p1 = distance between (3,7) and (3,4): 3^2 = 9

p2 = distance between (6,7) and (6,4): 3^2 = 9

Then, 3*3 = 9, which is correct.

Seems consistent.

But, is there a case where this might fail?

Let me think about a degenerate case, but the problem says it's guaranteed to be a valid square with positive area.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "a square of positive (strictly greater than 0) area", so we don't have to worry about zero-area squares.

Also, the sides are parallel to the axes, so no need to worry about rotated squares.

Given that, this approach seems to work.

Alternatively, another way could be to find the unique x and y values.

From the sorted coordinates, the unique x values are the first and third elements (since sorted, they are the min and max x).

Similarly, the unique y values are the second and fourth elements in the sorted list.

Then, compute the difference between the x values and the y values, square them, and that's the area.

But the given code is calculating the distances between the first two and last two points, which in this sorting, are the vertical sides.

Then, multiplying those distances gives the area.

So, it's a bit convoluted, but it works.

Alternatively, a simpler way could be to find the difference between the max and min x, and max and min y, and since it's a square, they should be equal, and then square that difference.

But the given code is doing it differently, but still correctly.

Therefore, I would say the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
