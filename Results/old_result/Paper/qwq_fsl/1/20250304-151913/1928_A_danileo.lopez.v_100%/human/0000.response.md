Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from his original rectangle of size a x b by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The program should output "Yes" if it's possible and "No" otherwise.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Bob has a rectangle with dimensions a and b. He can make one cut parallel to one of the sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles. Then, he can rearrange these two rectangles (possibly rotating them) to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle should be different from the original one, considering that rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 (since 4x3 is not the same as 2x6 or 6x2).

On the other hand, a 2x1 rectangle can be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only be arranged back into a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

So, the task is to determine, for given a and b, whether there exists at least one way to cut and rearrange the rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())

        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:

            if a % 2 == 0:

                (a1, a2) = (a // 2, a // 2)

                if a1 != b:

                    print('Yes')

                    continue

            if b % 2 == 0:

                (b1, b2) = (b // 2, b // 2)

                if b1 != a:

                    print('Yes')

                    continue

            print('No')

        else:

            print('No')

```

I need to verify if this program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read the dimensions a and b.

b. Check if either a or b is even.

- If a is even:

- Cut a into two equal parts: a1 = a2 = a // 2.

- If a1 is not equal to b, print "Yes" and proceed to the next test case.

- If a1 equals b, move on to check if b is even.

- If b is even:

- Cut b into two equal parts: b1 = b2 = b // 2.

- If b1 is not equal to a, print "Yes" and proceed to the next test case.

- If both a and b are odd, or if neither cut results in a new rectangle, print "No".

This seems straightforward, but I need to verify if this logic covers all possible cases correctly.

Let's consider some test cases to verify the program:

**Test Case 1:**

Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

According to the example provided, the program should produce this output.

Let's see why:

1. 1x1: Cannot be cut into two rectangles, so "No".

2. 2x1: Cutting a=2 into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form back into 1x2 or 2x1, same as original, so "No".

3. 2x6: Cutting a=2 into two 1x6 rectangles, which can be arranged into 1x12 or 12x1, which is different from 2x6, so "Yes".

Alternatively, cutting b=6 into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged into 4x3, different from 2x6, so "Yes".

4. 3x2: Cutting a=3 into two 1.5x2 rectangles, but since dimensions are integers, it's invalid. Wait, the program assumes integer sides, so cutting a=3 into two integers would be impossible unless 3 is even, which it's not. Wait, but in the problem, a and b are integers, and cuts are into integer sides.

Wait, the problem states that the cuts are parallel to one of the sides, and the resulting rectangles have integer sides.

So, for a=3, b=2, since a is odd, cannot cut a into two integers, so only option is to cut b=2 into two 1x2 rectangles. Then, arranging two 1x2 rectangles can form a 2x2 rectangle, which is different from 3x2, so "Yes".

But according to the program:

- a=3 is odd

- b=2 is even

- So, it checks b % 2 == 0

- Cuts b into two 1x2 rectangles

- Then, checks if b1 != a, which is 1 != 3, so "Yes"

- So, it should print "Yes", which matches the example.

5. 2x2: Cutting a=2 into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into a 1x4 or 4x1 rectangle, different from 2x2, so "Yes".

6. 2x4: Cutting a=2 into two 1x4 rectangles, which can be arranged into 1x8 or 8x1, different from 2x4, so "Yes".

Alternatively, cutting b=4 into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into 4x2 or 2x4, same as original, so not a new rectangle.

But according to the program:

- a=2 is even

- Cut a into two 1x4 rectangles

- a1 = 1 != 4, so "Yes"

- So, it prints "Yes", which matches the example.

7. 6x3: Cutting a=6 into two 3x3 rectangles, which can be arranged into 3x6 or 6x3, same as original.

Cutting b=3 into two 1.5x3 rectangles, invalid since sides must be integers.

So, no new rectangle can be formed, so "No".

According to the program:

- a=6 is even

- Cut a into two 3x3 rectangles

- a1 = 3 != 3, which is False, so moves to b

- b=3 is odd

- So, prints "No", which matches the example.

So, the example seems to be correctly handled by the program.

Now, let's think about other test cases to see if the program handles them correctly.

**Test Case 2:**

Input:

2

4 4

3 3

Output:

Yes

No

Explanation:

1. 4x4: Cutting a=4 into two 2x4 rectangles, which can be arranged into 2x8 or 8x2, different from 4x4, so "Yes".

2. 3x3: Cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, since both a and b are odd, so "No".

According to the program:

- For 4x4:

- a=4 is even

- Cut a into two 2x4 rectangles

- a1 = 2 != 4, so "Yes"

- For 3x3:

- a=3 is odd

- b=3 is odd

- So, "No"

Correct.

**Test Case 3:**

Input:

3

1 2

2 2

3 4

Output:

Yes

Yes

Yes

Explanation:

1. 1x2: Cutting a=1 is invalid, since a is odd.

Cutting b=2 into two 1x1 rectangles, which can be arranged into 1x2 or 2x1, same as original, so "No".

But according to the program:

- a=1 is odd

- b=2 is even

- Cut b into two 1x1 rectangles

- b1 = 1 != 1, which is False, so "No"

Wait, but in the problem, for 1x2, it should be "No", but in the example above, it's "Yes". Wait, no, in the initial example, 2x1 is "No", so 1x2 should also be "No".

Wait, but according to the program, for a=1 (odd), b=2 (even):

- Cut b into two 1x1 rectangles

- b1 =1 != a=1, which is False, so "No"

So, correct.

Wait, but in the test case above, I said "Yes", which is incorrect. Let me correct it.

Correct Output:

No

Yes

Yes

Wait, but in the program, for a=1, b=2:

- a odd, b even

- Cut b into two 1x1 rectangles

- b1 =1 == a=1, so "No"

So, "No", which is correct.

Wait, but in the initial example, 2x1 is "No", and 1x2 should be the same as 2x1, just rotated.

So, it should be "No".

So, the program seems correct for this case.

Another test case:

**Test Case 4:**

Input:

1

4 2

Output:

Yes

Explanation:

Cut a=4 into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into 2x4 or 4x2, same as original.

Cut b=2 into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into 1x4 or 4x1, different from 4x2.

So, "Yes".

According to the program:

- a=4 is even

- Cut a into two 2x2 rectangles

- a1=2 != b=2, which is False, so moves to b

- b=2 is even

- Cut b into two 1x2 rectangles

- b1=1 != a=4, which is True, so "Yes"

Correct.

**Test Case 5:**

Input:

1

Alternatively, cut b=6 into two 3x4 rectangles, which can be arranged into 3x8 or 8x3, different from 4x6.

So, "Yes".

According to the program:

- a=4 even

- Cut a into two 2x6 rectangles

- a1=2 != b=6, which is True, so "Yes"

Correct.

Explanation:

Cut a=8 into two 4x4 rectangles, which can be arranged into 4x8 or 8x4, same as original.

Cut b=4 into two 2x4 rectangles, which can be arranged into 2x8 or 8x2, different from 8x4.

So, "Yes".

According to the program:

- a=8 even

- Cut a into two 4x4 rectangles

- a1=4 != b=4, which is False, so moves to b

- b=4 even

- Cut b into two 2x4 rectangles

- b1=2 != a=8, which is True, so "Yes"

Correct.

**Test Case 9:**

Input:

1

1 3

So, "Yes".

According to the program:

- a=6 even

- Cut a into two 3x8 rectangles

- a1=3 != b=8, which is True, so "Yes"

Correct.

**Test Case 11:**

Input:

Explanation:

Cut a=10 into two 5x10 rectangles, which can be arranged into 5x20 or 20x5, different from 10x10.

Cut b=10 into two 5x10 rectangles, same as above.

So, "Yes".

According to the program:

- a=10 even

- Cut a into two 5x10 rectangles

- a1=5 != b=10, which is True, so "Yes"

Correct.

**Test Case 12:**

Input:

1

7 2

Output:

Yes

Explanation:

Cut a=7 into two 3.5x2 rectangles, invalid.

Cut b=2 into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into 1x4 or 4x1, different from 7x2.

So, "Yes".

According to the program:

- a=7 odd

- b=2 even

- Cut b into two 1x2 rectangles

- b1=1 != a=7, which is True, so "Yes"

Correct.

**Test Case 13:**

Input:

1

9 9

Output:

No

Explanation:

Cannot cut a=9 (odd) or b=9 (odd)

So, "No".

According to the program:

- a=9 odd, b=9 odd

- So, "No"

Correct.

**Test Case 14:**

Input:

1

1000000000 1000000000

Output:

Yes

Explanation:

Cut a=1000000000 into two 500000000x1000000000 rectangles, which can be arranged into 500000000x2000000000 or 2000000000x500000000, different from 1000000000x1000000000.

So, "Yes".

According to the program:

- a=1000000000 even

- Cut a into two 500000000x1000000000 rectangles

- a1=500000000 != b=1000000000, which is True, so "Yes"

Correct.

**Test Case 15:**

Input:

1

1 1000000000

Output:

No

Explanation:

Cut a=1 invalid (odd)

Cut b=1000000000 into two 500000000x1 rectangles, which can be arranged into 500000000x2 or 2x500000000, different from 1x1000000000.

So, "Yes".

But according to the program:

- a=1 odd

- b=1000000000 even

- Cut b into two 500000000x1 rectangles

- b1=500000000 != a=1, which is True, so "Yes"

Wait, but in my explanation, it should be "Yes", but initially, I thought it should be "No". Wait, no, it should be "Yes" because you can form a new rectangle.

So, the program outputs "Yes", which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that cutting b=1000000000 into two 500000000x1 rectangles can be arranged into 500000000x2 or 2x500000000, which is different from 1x1000000000, so "Yes".

Hence, the program is correct.

After testing these cases, it seems that the program correctly identifies whether it's possible to form a new rectangle from the given a x b rectangle.

Now, let's think about potential edge cases that might not be handled correctly.

**Edge Case 1:**

Input:

1

2 2

Output:

Program output: "Yes"

Correct.

**Edge Case 2:**

Input:

1

1 2

Output:

No

Explanation:

Cut b=2 into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form 1x2 or 2x1, same as original.

So, "No".

Program output: "No"

Correct.

**Edge Case 3:**

Input:

1

2 1

Output:

No

Explanation:

Same as above.

Program output: "No"

Correct.

**Edge Case 4:**

Input:

1

1 1

Output:

No

Explanation:

Cannot cut a=1 or b=1.

Program output: "No"

Correct.

**Edge Case 5:**

Input:

1

1000000000 1

Output:

No

Explanation:

Cut a=1000000000 into two 500000000x1 rectangles, which can be arranged into 500000000x2 or 2x500000000, different from 1000000000x1.

So, "Yes".

Program output: "Yes"

Correct.

**Edge Case 6:**

Input:

1

1 1000000000

Output:

Yes

Explanation:

Cut b=1000000000 into two 500000000x1 rectangles, which can be arranged into 500000000x2 or 2x500000000, different from 1x1000000000.

So, "Yes".

Program output: "Yes"

Correct.

**Edge Case 7:**

Input:

1

4 2

Output:

Yes

Explanation:

Cut a=4 into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into 2x4 or 4x2, same as original.

Cut b=2 into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into 1x4 or 4x1, different from 4x2.

So, "Yes".

Program output: "Yes"

Correct.

**Edge Case 8:**

Input:

1

6 3

Output:

No

Explanation:

Cut a=6 into two 3x3 rectangles, which can be arranged into 3x6 or 6x3, same as original.

Cut b=3 into two 1.5x3 rectangles, invalid.

So, "No".

Program output: "No"

Correct.

**Edge Case 9:**

Input:

1

8 4

Output:

Yes

Explanation:

Cut a=8 into two 4x4 rectangles, which can be arranged into 4x8 or 8x4, same as original.

Cut b=4 into two 2x4 rectangles, which can be arranged into 2x8 or 8x2, different from 8x4.

So, "Yes".

Program output: "Yes"

Correct.

**Edge Case 10:**

Input:

1

10 5

Output:

Yes

Explanation:

Cut a=10 into two 5x5 rectangles, which can be arranged into 5x10 or 10x5, same as original.

Cut b=5 into two 2.5x5 rectangles, invalid.

So, "No".

Wait, but according to the program:

- a=10 even

- Cut a into two 5x5 rectangles

- a1=5 != b=5, which is False, so moves to b

- b=5 odd

- So, "No"

So, "No"

Wait, but in my explanation, it should be "No", but earlier I thought it should be "Yes". Wait, no, cutting a=10 into two 5x5 and arranging them back into 5x10 or 10x5, which is the same as original. Cutting b=5 into two 2.5x5 invalid. So, "No".

Program output: "No"

Correct.

After considering these edge cases, it seems that the program handles them correctly.

Now, let's think about the logic behind the program.

The program checks if either a or b is even.

- If a is even, it cuts a into two equal parts a1 and a2.

- If a1 != b, it prints "Yes".

- If a1 == b, it checks if b is even.

- If b is even, it cuts b into two equal parts b1 and b2.

- If b1 != a, it prints "Yes".

- If neither condition is satisfied, it prints "No".

This logic seems to cover the cases where at least one of the dimensions is even, and the cuts lead to new rectangles that are different from the original.

However, I need to verify if there are any cases where this logic fails.

Let's consider a case where a is even, and cutting a leads to a1 == b, but cutting b leads to b1 != a.

For example:

**Test Case 16:**

Input:

1

4 2

Output:

Yes

Explanation:

Cut a=4 into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into 2x4 or 4x2, same as original.

Cut b=2 into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged into 1x4 or 4x1, different from 4x2.

So, "Yes".

According to the program:

- a=4 even

- a1=2 == b=2, so moves to b

- b=2 even

- b1=1 != a=4, so "Yes"

Correct.

Another case:

**Test Case 17:**

Input:

1

6 3

Output:

No

Explanation:

Cut a=6 into two 3x3 rectangles, which can be arranged into 3x6 or 6x3, same as original.

Cut b=3 into two 1.5x3 rectangles, invalid.

So, "No".

Program output: "No"

Correct.

Wait, but according to the initial example, 6x3 should be "No", which matches the program.

Is there any case where a is even, and a1 == b, and b is even, and b1 == a, which should be "No"?

Let's try:

**Test Case 18:**

Input:

1

4 2

Wait, in this case:

a=4, b=2

a1=2 == b=2

b1=1 != a=4

So, "Yes"

But according to the explanation, it should be "Yes", which is correct.

Another case:

**Test Case 19:**

Input:

1

8 4

a=8, b=4

a1=4 == b=4

b1=2 != a=8

So, "Yes"

Correct.

Wait, but in this case, cutting a=8 into two 4x4 rectangles, which can be arranged into 4x8 or 8x4, same as original.

Cutting b=4 into two 2x4 rectangles, which can be arranged into 2x8 or 8x2, different from 8x4.

So, "Yes"

Correct.

Is there a case where a is even, a1 == b, and b is even, b1 == a, but actually, it's not possible to form a new rectangle?

Wait, let's think about a=4, b=2:

a1=2 == b=2

b1=1 != a=4

So, "Yes"

But in reality, it's possible to form a new rectangle by cutting b=2 into two 1x2 rectangles and arranging them into 1x4 or 4x1, which is different from 4x2.

So, "Yes" is correct.

Another case:

**Test Case 20:**

Input:

1

6 3

a=6, b=3

a1=3 == b=3

b is odd, so no cut possible.

So, "No"

Correct.

Wait, but in this case, cutting a=6 into two 3x3 rectangles, which can be arranged into 3x6 or 6x3, same as original.

No other cuts possible, so "No"

Correct.

I can't think of any case where the program would give an incorrect answer based on the problem description.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
