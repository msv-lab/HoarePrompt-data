Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program is correct, I need to print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partially correct programs are considered incorrect. I need to ensure that the program meets the requirements for every potential case as per the problem description.

First, I need to understand the problem description thoroughly. Let's read it again:

"Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together. In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points while the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each. Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p1, p2, and p3. Additionally, it is guaranteed that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If there isn't any way to obtain p1, p2, and p3 as a result of a non-negative number of games between the three players, print -1 instead."

So, we have three players with scores p1, p2, p3, where p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given these scores, or determine if it's impossible.

Now, let's look at the provided program:

```python
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

I need to verify if this program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws for each test case, or returns -1 if it's impossible.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Total Points Calculation:**

   - `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`

   - In chess games where each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a winner and loser) or 2 points (in case of a draw), the total points should always be even. Hence, if `total_points` is odd, it's impossible, and the program correctly returns -1.

2. **Total Matches Calculation:**

   - `total_matchs = total_points // 2`

   - This calculates the total number of matches played, as each match contributes exactly 2 points.

   - There's a condition: `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:`

     - I need to understand why `total_matchs > 3` is a condition for impossibility. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding here because there's no restriction mentioned in the problem description about the maximum number of matches being 3. This seems suspicious.

3. **Calculating Draws:**

   - `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`

   - This seems like an attempt to calculate the points contributed by draws, but it's not clear where this formula comes from.

   - Then, `egalites // 2` is used to get the number of draws.

Given that, I need to verify if this logic correctly computes the maximum number of draws for any given valid input.

Let's consider the examples provided:

- **Example 1:**

  - Input: 0 0 0

  - Output: 0

  - Explanation: No games were played, so no draws could occur.

- **Example 2:**

  - Input: 0 1 1

  - Output: 1

  - Explanation: One game between player 2 and 3 ended in a draw.

- **Example 3:**

  - Input: 1 1 1

  - Output: -1

  - Explanation: It's impossible to have all three players with 1 point each.

- **Example 4:**

  - Input: 1 1 2

  - Output: 2

  - Explanation: Not provided, need to think about it.

- **Example 5:**

  - Input: 3 3 3

  - Output: -1

  - Explanation: It's impossible to have all three players with 3 points each.

- **Example 6:**

  - Input: 3 4 5

  - Output: 6

  - Explanation: Not provided.

- **Example 7:**

  - Input: 1 1 10

  - Output: 2

  - Explanation: Not provided.

Looking back at the program, in the third test case `(0, 2, 3)`, which is not present in the examples, but according to the program, it would calculate:

- total_points = 0 + 2 + 3 = 5, which is odd, so output -1.

But in the examples, there's a test case `(0, 1, 1)` which sums to 2, which is even.

Wait, the provided program has `(0, 2, 3)` as one of the test cases, but in the problem description, it's `(0, 1, 1)`. There might be a discrepancy here.

Wait, in the problem description, the sample input is:

7

0 0 0

0 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 2

3 3 3

3 4 5

1 1 10

And the sample output is:

0

1

-1

2

-1

6

2

But in the program, `cas_de_test` is defined as:

[(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]

Wait, the third test case in the program is `(0, 2, 3)`, but in the problem description's sample input, it's `(1, 1, 1)`. So, there's a mismatch here.

Assuming that the program's test cases are correct, I need to verify if the program's logic correctly handles all possible cases.

Let me try to understand the logic behind the program.

First, the total points must be even; otherwise, it's impossible, and it returns -1. That makes sense.

Then, it calculates the total number of matches as `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.

Next, it checks if `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`. This seems problematic because there's no restriction on the number of matches being greater than 3 in the problem description. Maybe this is an error.

Furthermore, the way it calculates `egalites` is not clear. Let's try to derive the correct approach.

I need to find the maximum number of draws possible given the scores p1, p2, p3.

Let's think about the possible matches and their outcomes.

Each match can be:

- A win for one player: 2 points to the winner, 0 to the loser.

- A draw: 1 point to each player.

Given that, let's denote:

- Let m_ab be the number of matches between player A and B.

- m_ac be the number of matches between player A and C.

- m_bc be the number of matches between player B and C.

Each match can either be a win or a draw.

Let's denote:

- d_ab be the number of draws between A and B.

- w_a_ab be the number of wins for A in matches against B.

- w_b_ab be the number of wins for B in matches against B.

Similarly for other pairs.

Then, the points can be calculated as:

p_a = 2*(w_a_ab + w_a_ac) + d_ab + d_ac

p_b = 2*(w_b_ab + w_b_bc) + d_ab + d_bc

p_c = 2*(w_c_ac + w_c_bc) + d_ac + d_bc

Our goal is to maximize the total number of draws, which is d_ab + d_bc + d_ac.

Given the constraints on p1, p2, p3, we need to find non-negative integers m_ab, m_ac, m_bc, d_ab, d_bc, d_ac, w_a_ab, w_b_ab, w_a_ac, w_c_ac, w_b_bc, w_c_bc such that:

- m_ab = d_ab + w_a_ab + w_b_ab

- m_ac = d_ac + w_a_ac + w_c_ac

- m_bc = d_bc + w_b_bc + w_c_bc

- p_a = 2*(w_a_ab + w_a_ac) + d_ab + d_ac

- p_b = 2*(w_b_ab + w_b_bc) + d_ab + d_bc

- p_c = 2*(w_c_ac + w_c_bc) + d_ac + d_bc

And we need to maximize d_ab + d_bc + d_ac.

This seems quite complex. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let's consider that each draw contributes 1 point to each player, and each win contributes 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.

Let’s denote:

- Let t be the total number of matches played, which is (m_ab + m_ac + m_bc).

- Each match contributes exactly 2 points, so total_points = 2*t.

Hence, if the sum of p1 + p2 + p3 is not even, it's impossible, which matches the program's first check.

Now, to maximize the number of draws, we need to maximize the number of matches that ended in a draw.

Let’s denote:

- Let d be the total number of draws.

- Let w be the total number of wins.

We have:

- d + w = t

- The total points can be expressed as:

  - p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*w + d

  - But since p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*t, then:

    - 2*w + d = 2*t

    - Substituting w = t - d:

    - 2*(t - d) + d = 2*t => 2*t - 2*d + d = 2*t => 2*t - d = 2*t => d = 0

This suggests that d can be up to t, but subject to the individual player scores.

This seems contradictory. Let's think differently.

Let's consider that in order to maximize draws, we should minimize wins, because each win uses up more points.

Wait, actually, wins give 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, while draws give 1 point to each.

Given that, to maximize draws, we need to see how many points can be distributed via draws.

But it's getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems involving maximizing draws, we can use linear programming or some inequalities.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to compute the maximum possible draws based on the individual player scores.

Let me consider that the maximum draws would occur if as many points as possible come from draws, meaning that players' points are as evenly distributed as possible.

But given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, there might be limitations based on the highest score.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of draws is limited by the highest score.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose that we have t matches, with d draws and w wins.

Then:

- Total points: 2*t = p1 + p2 + p3

- Points from wins: 2*w

- Points from draws: d

So:

- 2*w + d = p1 + p2 + p3

But also, w + d = t

From the first equation: 2*(t - d) + d = 2*t => 2*t - 2*d + d = 2*t => 2*t - d = 2*t => d = 0

This again suggests that d = 0, which can't be right because in the sample input, there are draws.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me consider that in reality, t = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

And d = 2*t - (p1 + p2 + p3)

But from above, d = 0, which contradicts the sample input where d = 1 for input (0,1,1)

Wait, perhaps my equations are incorrect.

Let me look up the theory on this.

Upon researching, I find that in a round-robin tournament with draws, the total points should be equal to twice the number of wins plus the number of draws.

Given that each match results in either 2 points (win) or 1 point (draw) for each player, the total points should be equal to 2*w + d, where w is the number of wins and d is the number of draws.

But since each match results in either a win or a draw, t = w + d, where t is the total number of matches.

Given that, total points = 2*w + d = 2*(t - d) + d = 2*t - d

But we also know that total points = p1 + p2 + p3

Therefore:

p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*t - d

But t is the total number of matches, which is also equal to the total number of games played among the three players.

Given that there are three pairs of players, and each pair can play any number of games, t can be any integer such that t >= max(p1, p2, p3)/2.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws occurs when the difference in points between players is minimized.

But in our case, since p1 <= p2 <= p3, the difference is already ordered.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum possible draws being when p1 + p2 >= p3.

Wait, let's consider that the highest scorer, p3, can have at most t matches, where t is the total number of matches.

But p3 can win some matches and draw some.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and see what the program does.

Sample Input:

7

0 0 0

0 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 2

3 3 3

3 4 5

1 1 10

Sample Output:

0

1

-1

2

-1

6

2

Now, looking at the program's test cases:

[(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]

Wait, the third test case is (0, 2, 3), but in the sample input, it's (1,1,1). So there might be a mistake here.

Assuming that the program's test cases are correct, I need to verify if the program's logic aligns with the expected outputs.

Let's take the first test case:

(0, 0, 0)

- total_points = 0, which is even.

- total_matchs = 0 // 2 = 0

- p3 = 0 <= total_matchs = 0

- egalites = 0 - 2*(0-0) -2*(0-0) = 0

- egalites // 2 = 0, which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

(0, 1, 1)

- total_points = 2, which is even.

- total_matchs = 1

- p3 = 1 <= total_matchs = 1

- egalites = 2 - 2*(1-1) -2*(1-0) = 2 - 0 -2 = 0

- egalites // 2 = 0, but the sample output is 1, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back:

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

For (0,1,1):

egalites = 2 - 2*(1-1) -2*(1-0) = 2 - 0 -2 = 0

Then, egalites // 2 = 0, but the sample output is 1.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Let me try to derive a correct formula.

Let’s consider that to maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of matches that ended in a draw.

Given that, we need to see how many points can be attributed to draws.

Each draw contributes 1 point to each player involved, whereas a win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.

Given that, to maximize draws, we need to minimize the number of wins.

Let’s denote:

- Let d be the total number of draws.

- Let w be the total number of wins.

- Total matches: t = d + w

- Total points: p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*w + d

- Also, t = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Wait, from p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*w + d and t = w + d, we can solve for d and w.

From t = w + d and p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*w + d = 2*(t - d) + d = 2*t - d

Therefore, d = 2*t - (p1 + p2 + p3)

But t = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, so d = 2*(p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - (p1 + p2 + p3) = 0

This suggests that d = 0, which contradicts the sample input where d = 1 for input (0,1,1).

Therefore, there must be a mistake in this approach.

Let me try another approach.

Let’s consider that in order to maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of matches where both players get 1 point.

Given the individual scores, we need to see how many such matches are possible without violating the individual scores.

Let’s consider that for each draw, two players each get 1 point.

So, for d draws, 2*d points are distributed.

The remaining points must come from wins, where 2 points are given to the winner and 0 to the loser.

So, total points from wins: 2*w

Total points: 2*w + 2*d = p1 + p2 + p3

Wait, that doesn't make sense because each draw contributes 2 points in total (1 to each player), and each win contributes 2 points.

So, total points = 2*w + 2*d = p1 + p2 + p3

Therefore, w + d = t = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Our goal is to maximize d, so we need to minimize w.

However, we have constraints on individual scores.

Each player's total points come from the sums of their draws and wins.

For example, p1 = number of draws involving p1 + 2*(number of wins where p1 is the winner)

Similarly for p2 and p3.

So, to maximize d, we need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring that the individual scores are met.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints.

Perhaps I can model it using equations.

Let’s denote:

- Let d_ab be the number of draws between a and b.

- Similarly, d_ac and d_bc.

- Let w_ab be the number of wins for a in matches against b.

- Similarly, w_ac, w_bc.

Then:

p1 = d_ab + d_ac + 2*w_ac + 2*w_ab

p2 = d_ab + d_bc + 2*w_bc + 2*w_ab

p3 = d_ac + d_bc + 2*w_ac + 2*w_bc

Our goal is to maximize d_ab + d_ac + d_bc.

Subject to:

- d_ab, d_ac, d_bc, w_ab, w_ac, w_bc >= 0 and integers.

This seems complicated to solve directly.

Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many matches as possible end in a draw, without violating the individual score constraints.

To maximize draws, we need to minimize wins.

So, let's see what's the minimal number of wins required to achieve the given scores.

Each win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, while each draw contributes 1 point to each player.

So, to minimize wins, we need to maximize draws, but subject to the individual scores.

Let’s consider that the sum of points is 2*t, where t is the total number of matches.

Given that, t = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

Now, to maximize d, we set d as high as possible, but we need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved.

Perhaps I can iterate from d = t down to d = 0 and check if the remaining points can be achieved with wins.

But this might be time-consuming.

Let me think about the constraints on individual scores.

Since p1 <= p2 <= p3, and p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*t, we can try to see what's the maximum d such that:

p1 <= d + 2*w1

p2 <= d + 2*w2

p3 <= d + 2*w3

Where w1, w2, w3 are the number of wins for each player.

But also, w1 + w2 + w3 = t - d

And p1 = d + 2*w1

p2 = d + 2*w2

p3 = d + 2*w3

So, p1 + p2 + p3 = 3*d + 2*(w1 + w2 + w3) = 3*d + 2*(t - d) = d + 2*t

But we know that p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*t, so:

d + 2*t = 2*t => d = 0

Again, this suggests that d = 0, which contradicts the sample input.

I must be missing something.

Let’s consider that in reality, d is the number of matches that ended in a draw, and each draw involves two players.

So, for d draws, 2*d points are distributed (1 to each player per draw).

The remaining points come from wins.

So, total points from wins: 2*w

Thus, 2*w + 2*d = p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*t => w + d = t

This is consistent with t = w + d.

But earlier, I derived d = 0, which can't be right.

Perhaps I need to consider the individual constraints.

Let’s consider that p3 is the highest score, so p3 <= t, since a player can't score more than t matches played.

Wait, but p3 can be up to 2*t, if a player wins all their matches.

Wait, no, p3 can be up to 2*m, where m is the number of matches that player participated in.

But in this case, since there are three players, each player plays multiple matches against the others.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for an invariant or some property that can help determine the maximum draws.

Let me consider that in order to maximize draws, the differences between the players' scores should be minimized.

But in reality, the differences are given by p3 - p2 and p2 - p1.

Perhaps I can express the maximum draws in terms of these differences.

Looking back at the program, it computes:

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

This seems arbitrary; I need to understand where this comes from.

Let’s consider an example.

Take the second test case: (0,1,1)

total_points = 2

egalites = 2 - 2*(1-1) -2*(1-0) = 2 - 0 -2 = 0

But the sample output is 1, which contradicts.

Hence, the program seems to have a flaw in this calculation.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the total number of matches t = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2

To maximize draws, I need to maximize d such that p1, p2, p3 can be achieved.

Each draw affects two players, adding 1 to each.

Each win affects one player, adding 2.

So, to achieve p1, p2, p3, I need to see if there's an assignment of d draws and w wins that satisfies the equations.

This seems like a system of linear equations.

Let’s denote:

- Let x be the number of draws between a and b.

- y be the number of draws between a and c.

- z be the number of draws between b and c.

- Similarly
