Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem description. Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. The store offers two options:

1. Buy one yogurt for a burles.

2. Buy two yogurts for b burles, which might be cheaper than buying them individually.

The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy exactly n yogurts.

Looking at the provided program:

```python

def func():

    for i in range(int(input())):

        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())

        if B * 2 < C:

            print(A * B)

        elif A % 2 == 0:

            print(int(A * C / 2))

        else:

            X = A // 2

            print(X * C + B)

```

First, I need to map the variables in the code to the problem description. It seems that:

- A corresponds to n (number of yogurts to buy).

- B corresponds to a (price of one yogurt).

- C corresponds to b (price for two yogurts on promotion).

So, the function reads multiple test cases (t cases), each consisting of A, B, and C.

Now, let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. If the cost of buying two yogurts individually (B * 2) is less than the promotion price (C), it's better to always buy yogurts individually. So, the total cost is A * B.

2. If A is even and the promotion is not worse than buying individually, buy in pairs. So, total cost is (A / 2) * C.

3. If A is odd, buy as many pairs as possible and one yogurt individually. So, total cost is (A // 2) * C + B.

Wait a minute, in the third case, when A is odd, it buys (A // 2) pairs and one yogurt individually. But, according to the problem, the promotion is for two yogurts. So, perhaps buying (A // 2) pairs and one yogurt individually is correct.

But, I need to check if there's a better way. For example, sometimes buying an extra yogurt in promotion might be cheaper.

Let me think about an example.

Suppose A = 3, B = 5, C = 11.

According to the program:

- B * 2 = 10, which is less than C = 11, so it's better to buy individually.

- But wait, in the example output, for A=3, B=5, C=11, the output is 15, which is 3 * 5 = 15.

But according to the program, if B * 2 < C, print A * B, which is 15.

But the note says: "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5."

Wait, but buying two for 11 and one for 5 would total 16, which is more than 15. So, buying individually is better.

But let's see what the program does:

- If B * 2 < C, which is 10 < 11, then print A * B = 15.

- Which matches the example output.

Another example: A=4, B=5, C=11.

Program:

- B * 2 = 10 < C=11, so print A * B = 20.

- Which matches the fourth test case output.

Wait, but in the note, for A=4, buying four individually costs 20, but maybe buying two pairs would cost 22, which is more. So, buying individually is better.

Program correctly chooses individual purchase when B * 2 < C.

Now, let's consider when B * 2 >= C.

Take the second test case: A=3, B=5, C=9.

Program:

- B * 2 = 10 >= C=9.

- A is odd, so X = 3 // 2 = 1.

- Total cost = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14.

- Which matches the second example output.

But according to the note, in the third test case (A=3, B=5, C=11), it's better to buy individually for 15 than buying two for 11 and one for 5, which would be 16.

Program correctly chooses individual purchase when B * 2 < C.

Wait, but in the second test case, B * 2 = 10 >= C=9, so it buys one pair for 9 and one yogurt for 5, total 14.

Seems correct.

Now, is there any case where this logic fails?

Let me think about when A is even.

Suppose A=4, B=5, C=9.

Program:

- B * 2 = 10 >= C=9.

- A is even, so print(int(A * C / 2)) = int(4 * 9 / 2) = int(18) = 18.

- But, actually, buying two pairs would cost 18.

- But, if B * 2 = 10, which is more than C=9, so promotion is better.

- But, is there a better way? Maybe buying all four with promotion.

Wait, but the program buys in pairs, so 2 pairs for 18.

But, if B * 2 = 10 > C=9, so promotion is better.

So, program chooses to buy in pairs, which is correct.

Alternative approach: buy two pairs for 18, or buy three yogurts for 15 (but A=4, so not applicable).

Wait, no. A=4, so must buy exactly 4.

Program buys two pairs for 18.

But, if B=5, C=9, then buying four individually would cost 20, which is worse than 18.

So, program correctly chooses promotion.

Another case: A=4, B=5, C=20.

Program:

- B * 2 = 10 < C=20, so buy individually for 20.

- Which is correct, since buying two pairs would cost 40, which is worse.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in this case, buying two pairs costs 40, which is worse than buying individually for 20.

Program correctly chooses individual purchase.

Another case: A=5, B=5, C=9.

Program:

- B * 2 = 10 >= C=9.

- A is odd, so X=2, total cost=2*9 +5=23.

- But, is there a better way? Buying two pairs for 18 and one individually for 5, total 23.

- Or, buying three individually for 15 and one pair for 9, total 24, which is worse.

- So, program's choice is better.

Seems correct.

Wait, but what if C is very small compared to B.

Let's say A=3, B=6, C=7.

Program:

- B * 2 = 12 >= C=7.

- A is odd, so X=1, total=1*7 +6=13.

- But, buying two for 7 and one for 6, total 13.

- Alternatively, buying three individually for 18, which is worse.

- So, correct.

Another case: A=2, B=5, C=9.

Program:

- B * 2 =10 >= C=9.

- A is even, so print(int(2*9/2)=9).

- Which is correct, buying one pair for 9.

Alternative: buying two individually for 10, which is worse.

So, program correctly chooses promotion.

Another case: A=2, B=5, C=10.

Program:

- B * 2 =10 >= C=10.

- A is even, so print(int(2*10/2)=10).

- Which is same as buying individually.

- Which is correct.

Another case: A=1, B=5, C=9.

Program:

- B * 2 =10 >= C=9.

- A is odd, X=0, total=0*9 +5=5.

- Which is correct, since you can't buy a pair for C=9 when n=1.

Seems correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, n >=1, so n=1 is valid.

Program handles it correctly.

What about n=0? Wait, n >=1 as per problem (n <=100).

But, in the code, if A=0, it would still try to process, but since n >=1, it's fine.

Another case: A=6, B=5, C=9.

Program:

- B * 2=10 >= C=9.

- A is even, so print(int(6*9/2)=27).

- Alternative: buying three pairs for 27, or buying individually for 30.

- So, correct.

Wait, but is there a better way? No, because 27 is the best.

Another case: A=5, B=5, C=9.

Program:

- B * 2=10 >= C=9.

- A is odd, X=2, total=2*9 +5=23.

- Alternative: buying two pairs for 18 and one individually for 5, total 23.

- Or, buying three individually for 15 and one pair for 9, total 24, which is worse.

- So, program's choice is better.

Seems correct.

Wait, but what if C is less than B, say A=1, B=10, C=9.

Program:

- B * 2=20 >= C=9.

- A is odd, X=0, total=0*9 +10=10.

- But, can we buy one pair for 9 and return one yogurt? No, must buy exactly n.

- So, buying one individually for 10 is correct.

- Can't buy a pair and return one, probably not allowed.

So, program is correct.

Another edge case: A=4, B=5, C=10.

Program:

- B * 2=10 >= C=10.

- A is even, so print(int(4*10/2)=20).

- Alternative: buying two pairs for 20 or buying four individually for 20.

- Both same, so correct.

Another case: A=3, B=5, C=9.

Program:

- B * 2=10 >= C=9.

- A is odd, X=1, total=1*9 +5=14.

- Alternative: buying one pair for 9 and one individually for 5, total 14.

- Or, buying three individually for 15, which is worse.

- So, correct.

Seems like the program handles various cases correctly.

Wait, but in the note, it says for A=3, B=5, C=11, it's better to buy individually for 15 than buying two for 11 and one for 5, which would be 16.

Program, in this case, since B * 2 =10 < C=11, chooses to buy individually for 15, which is correct.

Another case: A=3, B=5, C=10.

Program:

- B * 2=10 >= C=10.

- A is odd, X=1, total=1*10 +5=15.

- Alternative: buying one pair for 10 and one individually for 5, total 15.

- Or, buying three individually for 15.

- Both same.

- So, correct.

Another case: A=3, B=5, C=8.

Program:

- B * 2=10 >= C=8.

- A is odd, X=1, total=1*8 +5=13.

- Alternative: buying one pair for 8 and one individually for 5, total 13.

- Or, buying three individually for 15, which is worse.

- So, correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but what if C is less than B but more than B * 2.

Wait, C is for two yogurts, so C should be less than or equal to B * 2 for the promotion to make sense.

But in the first example, C=9 and B=5, so C < B * 2.

In the third example, C=11 and B=5, so C > B * 2.

Program handles both cases correctly.

I can't find any case where the program fails to compute the minimum cost.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
