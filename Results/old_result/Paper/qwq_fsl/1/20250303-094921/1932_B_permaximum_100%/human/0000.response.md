Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to determine the year in which the nth sign occurs, given that each sign occurs periodically every a_i years, and they must occur sequentially without overlapping in a way that affects the waiting period for the next sign.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. The Chaya tribe has n signs of the apocalypse, each occurring every a_i years. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning that after one sign occurs, they start waiting for the next sign to occur in the immediately following years, skipping any occurrences that would have overlapped.

So, for example, if the first sign occurs every 3 years, and the second sign occurs every 2 years, and n=2, then:

- The first sign occurs in years 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.

- After the first sign occurs in year 3, they start waiting for the second sign starting from year 4.

- The second sign occurs every 2 years, so in years 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.

- But since they start waiting from year 4, the next sign they consider is in year 4.

- So, the second sign occurs in year 4.

- Therefore, for n=2, a=[3,2], the year when the second sign occurs is 4.

Wait, but according to the sample input and output, in the first test case with n=6 and a=[3,2,4,5,9,18], the output is 36, which matches the explanation given.

Now, looking at the code:

- It reads the number of test cases t.

- For each test case, it reads n and the list a.

- It seems to calculate for each test case the year when the nth sign occurs.

- It uses a function func_1 to compute this.

- In func_1, for each test case, it initializes current_year to 0.

- Then, for each ai in a, it calculates the next year when the sign occurs.

- If current_year is a multiple of ai, then the next occurrence is current_year + ai.

- Else, it calculates the next multiple of ai that is greater than current_year.

- It sets current_year to this next_year.

- Finally, it appends the current_year to results and prints each result.

Seems straightforward. But I need to verify if this logic correctly implements the problem's requirements.

According to the problem, after each sign occurs, they start waiting for the next sign starting from the year immediately after the current sign occurred.

So, if a sign occurs in year x, they start looking for the next sign from year x+1 onwards.

The code seems to handle this by checking if the current_year is a multiple of ai. If it is, then the next occurrence is current_year + ai. If not, it calculates the smallest multiple of ai that is greater than current_year.

Wait, but in terms of modulo, if current_year % ai == 0, then current_year is a multiple of ai, so the next occurrence is current_year + ai.

If current_year % ai != 0, then the next occurrence is the next multiple of ai after current_year, which is (current_year // ai + 1) * ai.

This seems correct.

Let me verify with the first sample input:

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

Starting with current_year=0.

1. ai=3:

- 0 % 3 == 0 → next_year = 0 + 3 = 3

- current_year = 3

2. ai=2:

- 3 % 2 == 1 ≠ 0 → next_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (1 + 1) * 2 = 4

- current_year = 4

3. ai=4:

- 4 % 4 == 0 → next_year = 4 + 4 = 8

- current_year = 8

4. ai=5:

- 8 % 5 == 3 ≠ 0 → next_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (1 + 1) * 5 = 10

- current_year = 10

5. ai=9:

- 10 % 9 == 1 ≠ 0 → next_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = (1 + 1) * 9 = 18

- current_year = 18

6. ai=18:

- 18 % 18 == 0 → next_year = 18 + 18 = 36

- current_year = 36

Which matches the sample output of 36.

Another sample input:

n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

Starting with current_year=0.

1. ai=1:

- 0 % 1 == 0 → next_year = 0 + 1 = 1

- current_year = 1

2. ai=2:

- 1 % 2 == 1 ≠ 0 → next_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (0 + 1) * 2 = 2

- current_year = 2

3. ai=3:

- 2 % 3 == 2 ≠ 0 → next_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3

- current_year = 3

4. ai=4:

- 3 % 4 == 3 ≠ 0 → next_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (0 + 1) * 4 = 4

- current_year = 4

5. ai=5:

- 4 % 5 == 4 ≠ 0 → next_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (0 + 1) * 5 = 5

- current_year = 5

Which matches the sample output of 5.

Another sample input:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

Starting with current_year=0.

1. ai=1:

- 0 % 1 == 0 → next_year = 0 + 1 = 1

- current_year = 1

2. ai=1:

- 1 % 1 == 0 → next_year = 1 + 1 = 2

- current_year = 2

3. ai=1:

- 2 % 1 == 0 → next_year = 2 + 1 = 3

- current_year = 3

4. ai=1:

- 3 % 1 == 0 → next_year = 3 + 1 = 4

- current_year = 4

5. ai=1:

- 4 % 1 == 0 → next_year = 4 + 1 = 5

- current_year = 5

Which matches the sample output of 5.

Last sample input:

n=6, a=[50,30,711,200,503,1006]

Starting with current_year=0.

1. ai=50:

- 0 % 50 == 0 → next_year = 0 + 50 = 50

- current_year = 50

2. ai=30:

- 50 % 30 == 20 ≠ 0 → next_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = (1 + 1) * 30 = 60

- current_year = 60

3. ai=711:

- 60 % 711 == 60 ≠ 0 → next_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = (0 + 1) * 711 = 711

- current_year = 711

4. ai=200:

- 711 % 200 == 111 ≠ 0 → next_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = (3 + 1) * 200 = 800

- current_year = 800

5. ai=503:

- 800 % 503 == 297 ≠ 0 → next_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = (1 + 1) * 503 = 1006

- current_year = 1006

6. ai=1006:

- 1006 % 1006 == 0 → next_year = 1006 + 1006 = 2012

- current_year = 2012

Which matches the sample output of 2012.

So, based on the sample inputs and outputs, the code seems to be working correctly.

But I need to think if there are any edge cases where this logic might fail.

Let me consider some edge cases:
