Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every potential case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all possible edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, let's understand the problem description. Sasha wants to rearrange an array to maximize its "beauty," which is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. I need to determine if the provided program correctly achieves this for any given array within the specified constraints.

Looking at the program:

```python

def func():

    ntest = int(input())

    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):

        n = int(input())

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        a.sort()

        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])

```

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the array size and the array itself, sorts the array, and prints the difference between the last and first elements.

Wait a minute, that seems too simplistic. According to the problem, the beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n. So, for an array [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], beauty = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}).

If I expand this sum, it's:

(a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

Wait, that's interesting. It seems like the sum telescopes, and the total beauty is simply an - a1, where an is the last element and a1 is the first element after sorting.

So, if we sort the array in ascending order, the beauty would be a_n - a_1.

But the problem allows any rearrangement. So, the maximum beauty would be achieved by arranging the array in such a way that the difference sum is maximized.

Hmm, but in the example provided:

Input:

3

2 1 3

Output:

2

Explanation:

Rearrange to [1, 2, 3], beauty = (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2.

Another example:

Input:

3

69 69 69

Output:

0

Explanation:

No need to rearrange, beauty = 0.

Another example:

Input:

5

100 54 80 43 90

Output:

57

Explanation:

Not clear yet.

Wait, in the first example, beauty is 2, which is the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

In the second example, all elements are the same, so difference is 0.

In the third example, let's sort the array: 43, 54, 80, 90, 100.

So, beauty would be 100 - 43 = 57, which matches the output.

So, it seems that the program is correctly calculating the beauty by sorting the array and taking the difference between the last and first elements.

But is this always the case?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n = 2, array = [2, 1].

If we arrange it as [1, 2], beauty = (2 - 1) = 1.

If we arrange it as [2, 1], beauty = (1 - 2) = -1.

But according to the program, it sorts the array and takes the difference between the last and first elements, which would be 2 - 1 = 1.

But the problem says to rearrange the array in any way, and the maximum beauty is desired.

So, in this case, arranging it as [1, 2] gives a beauty of 1, which is greater than arranging it as [2, 1], which gives -1.

Hence, sorting in ascending order maximizes the beauty.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "rearrange its elements in any way" to maximize the beauty.

Given that beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n, which simplifies to a_n - a_1, where a_n and a_1 are the last and first elements in the arranged order.

To maximize a_n - a_1, we should have a_n as large as possible and a_1 as small as possible.

So, by sorting the array in ascending order, a_n is the maximum value and a_1 is the minimum value, thus a_n - a_1 is maximized.

Wait, but suppose we arrange the array in descending order.

Then a_n - a_1 would be the minimum value minus the maximum value, which is negative, unless all elements are equal.

So, indeed, sorting in ascending order maximizes the beauty.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n = 4, array = [3, 4, 3, 3].

Sorted array: [3, 3, 3, 4].

Beauty = 4 - 3 = 1.

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

2

2 1

Output:

1

Arranging as [1, 2], beauty = 2 - 1 = 1.

Arranging as [2, 1], beauty = 1 - 2 = -1.

So, the maximum beauty is 1, which is what the program would output.

Hence, it seems that the program is correct.

But to be thorough, I should consider if there are any edge cases where this might not hold.

Let's think about an array with all elements equal.

For example, n = 3, array = [5, 5, 5].

Sorted array: [5, 5, 5].

Beauty = 5 - 5 = 0.

Which is correct, as per the second sample input.

Another edge case: n = 2, array = [1, 1000000000].

Sorted array: [1, 1000000000].

Beauty = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999.

Which is within the integer limits in Python.

Another edge case: n = 100, array with minimum and maximum values.

Since n <= 100 and a_i up to 10^9, the program should handle it fine.

Also, since t <= 500, and n <= 100, the time constraints should be fine, as sorting is O(n log n), which is acceptable for n=100.

Hence, I can conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
