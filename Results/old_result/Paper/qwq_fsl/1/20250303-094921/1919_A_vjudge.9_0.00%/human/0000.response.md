Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every potential case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all possible scenarios to ensure the program is correct.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice and Bob are playing a game with their wallets containing a certain number of coins. Alice starts with 'a' coins and Bob with 'b' coins. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep the current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

The program provided is supposed to determine who will win the game if both play optimally. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers a and b, and the output should be either "Alice" or "Bob" for each test case.

Looking at the program, it seems straightforward. There are two functions: func_1 and func_2. Func_2 reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, reads a and b, calls func_1 to determine the winner, and collects the results to print them later.

The logic in func_1 is simply checking if the sum of a and b is even or odd. If even, it returns 'Bob'; else, 'Alice'.

Wait a minute, is this logic correct? Does the sum of a and b being even or odd determine the winner? I need to verify this.

Let me think about the game mechanics. Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The game continues until someone can't make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty or when a player's current wallet is empty and they can't swap.

This seems like a impartial game, possibly similar to Nim or other impartial games where the concept of Nim-sum or parity can determine the winner under optimal play.

But is the sum of a and b the right metric here? Let's consider some small test cases to see if the program's logic holds.

Take the first example from the problem:

Input: 1 1

Output: Bob

According to the program:

a = 1, b = 1

a + b = 2, which is even, so return 'Bob'. This matches the expected output.

Second example:

Input: 1 4

Output: Alice

According to the program:

a = 1, b = 4

a + b = 5, which is odd, so return 'Alice'. This matches.

Third example:

Input: 5 3

Output: Bob

a + b = 8, even, so 'Bob'. Correct.

Fourth:

Input: 4 5

Output: Alice

a + b = 9, odd, so 'Alice'. Correct.

Fifth:

Input: 11 9

Output: Bob

a + b = 20, even, 'Bob'. Correct.

Sixth:

Input: 83 91

Output: Bob

a + b = 174, even, 'Bob'. Correct.

Seventh:

Input: 1032 9307

Output: Alice

a + b = 1032 + 9307 = 10339, which is odd, so 'Alice'. Correct.

Eighth:

Input: 839204 7281

Output: Alice

a + b = 839204 + 7281 = 846485, which is odd, so 'Alice'. Correct.

Ninth:

Input: 1000000000 1000000000

Output: Bob

a + b = 2000000000, even, 'Bob'. Correct.

Tenth:

Input: 53110 2024

Output: Bob

a + b = 53110 + 2024 = 55134, even, 'Bob'. Correct.

All the sample inputs match the expected outputs based on the program's logic. So, at least for these cases, the program seems correct.

But I need to ensure that this logic holds for all possible cases. Is the sum of a and b being even or odd always determining the winner?

Let me think about the game more deeply. Each move consists of two steps: choosing to swap wallets or not, and then removing one coin from the current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot remove a coin, which happens when their current wallet is empty and they can't swap to the other wallet, which also must be empty.

This seems similar to a game where the total number of coins is being reduced by one each turn. However, the swapping adds a strategic element.

Let's consider the total number of coins: a + b.

Each move reduces the total by one coin. The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which is when both wallets are empty.

So, the total number of moves possible is a + b.

Since Alice starts first, if a + b is odd, Alice makes the last move; if even, Bob makes the last move.

Wait a second, in standard impartial games like Nim, the player who makes the last move wins. So, if the total number of moves is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

But in this game, the player who cannot make a move loses, which might be different.

Wait, in this game, the player who cannot make a move loses, meaning the player who makes the last move wins, because the opponent cannot make a move after that.

So, if the total number of moves is odd, Alice makes the last move and wins; if even, Bob makes the last move and wins.

Therefore, the sum of a and b being odd would mean Alice wins, and even means Bob wins.

But let's verify this logic with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1: 1 1 → sum = 2 (even) → Bob wins. Matches sample output.

Sample Input 2: 1 4 → sum = 5 (odd) → Alice wins. Matches.

Sample Input 3: 5 3 → sum = 8 (even) → Bob wins. Matches.

And so on.

All sample inputs confirm this logic.

But is this always true? Let's consider some edge cases.

Edge Case 1: a = 1, b = 0

Wait, according to the problem, a and b are at least 1, as per the input constraints: 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.

So, a and b start with at least 1 coin each.

Edge Case 2: a = 1, b = 1

Sum = 2 (even) → Bob wins. Matches sample input.

Edge Case 3: a = 2, b = 2

Sum = 4 (even) → Bob wins.

Wait, let's simulate:

Alice's turn:

- Chooses to swap or not. If she swaps, a=2, b=2 (same).

- Removes 1 coin from current wallet. Say a=1, b=2.

Bob's turn:

- Chooses to swap or not. If he swaps, a=2, b=1.

- Removes 1 coin from current wallet. a=2, b=0.

Alice's turn:

- Chooses to swap or not.

- If she swaps, a=0, b=2.

- She cannot remove a coin from an empty wallet, so she must not swap.

- Removes 1 coin from a=2, now a=1, b=0.

Bob's turn:

- Chooses to swap or not.

- If he swaps, a=0, b=1.

- Removes 1 coin from b=1, now a=0, b=0.

Alice's turn:

- Both wallets are empty, cannot make a move. So, Alice loses. Bob wins.

Yes, sum was even, Bob wins.

Another Edge Case: a=3, b=3

Sum=6 (even) → Bob wins.

Simulate:

Alice: swap or not, remove 1. Say a=2, b=3.

Bob: swap or not, remove 1. Say a=2, b=2.

Alice: swap or not, remove 1. a=1, b=2.

Bob: swap or not, remove 1. a=1, b=1.

Alice: swap or not, remove 1. a=0, b=1.

Bob: swap to a=1, b=0. Remove 1 from a=1, now a=0, b=0.

Alice cannot move, Bob wins.

Again, sum even, Bob wins.

Another Edge Case: a=2, b=1

Sum=3 (odd) → Alice wins.

Simulate:

Alice: swap or not.

Option 1: do not swap, a=1, b=1.

Bob's turn: cannot swap since a=1, b=1, same as sample input 1. Bob wins.

Wait, according to the program, sum=3 is odd, so Alice wins. But in this simulation, Bob wins.

Wait, this is a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the game rules.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets.

2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step."

" The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses."

In the case where a=2, b=1:

Alice's turn:

- Choose to swap or not.

Option 1: do not swap, a=2, b=1. Remove 1 from a, now a=1, b=1.

Bob's turn:

- Choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps, a=1, b=1 (no change).

- Remove 1 from a, now a=0, b=1.

Alice's turn:

- Cannot swap because both wallets have 0 and 1, which is allowed only if swapping doesn't lead to a situation where the current wallet has 0 coins before removing.

Wait, the rule is: "Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step."

So, Alice has a=0, b=1.

- If she chooses to swap, she would have a=1, b=0.

- Then, she removes 1 from a=1, now a=0, b=0.

Bob's turn:

- Both wallets are empty, cannot make a move. So, Bob loses.

Wait, in this case, Alice wins, which matches the program's output since a + b = 3, which is odd.

Wait, but earlier I thought Bob wins, but according to the simulation, Alice wins.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let me try again.

Alice starts with a=2, b=1.

Alice's turn:

- Option 1: do not swap, a=2, b=1. Remove 1 from a, now a=1, b=1.

Bob's turn:

- Choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps, a=1, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a, now a=0, b=1.

Alice's turn:

- Current wallet is a=0.

- She cannot remove from a=0, so she must choose to swap.

- After swapping, a=1, b=0.

- Now, remove 1 from a=1, now a=0, b=0.

Bob's turn:

- Both wallets are empty, cannot make a move. So, Bob loses. Alice wins.

Yes, so Alice wins, which matches the program's logic since sum is odd.

Another test: a=3,2

Sum=5 (odd) → Alice wins.

Simulate:

Alice: swap or not.

Option 1: do not swap, a=3, b=2. Remove 1 from a, now a=2, b=2.

Bob: swap or not.

Option: swap, a=2, b=2. Remove 1 from a, now a=1, b=2.

Alice: swap or not.

Option: do not swap, a=1, b=2. Remove 1 from a, now a=0, b=2.

Bob: swap or not.

If he swaps, a=2, b=0.

Remove 1 from a, now a=1, b=0.

Alice: swap or not.

If she swaps, a=0, b=1.

Cannot remove from a=0, so she must not swap.

Remove 1 from b=1, now a=0, b=0.

Bob cannot move, so Alice wins.

Again, matches the program's logic.

Wait, so maybe the program's logic is correct.

But isn't this similar to the standard Nim game, where the XOR of the pile sizes determines the winner?

In standard Nim, if the XOR of pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move.

But in this game, it's different because of the swapping option.

Perhaps the swapping option makes it such that the total number of coins determines the winner.

Given that in all the simulations I tried, the sum being odd leads to Alice winning, and even sum leads to Bob winning.

Moreover, the sample inputs confirm this.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
