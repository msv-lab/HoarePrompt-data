Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". The key here is to ensure that the program works for every potential case, and if it fails even in one scenario, it's considered incorrect.

Let's first understand the problem description and what the program is supposed to do.

**Problem Description:**

Bob has a rectangle of size a × b. He tries to cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then, Bob tries to form some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90° rotation, they are considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6×4 and 4×6 are considered the same.

The task is to determine if Bob can obtain some other rectangle different from the original one through this process.

**Input:**

- The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

- Each of the next t lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the dimensions of Bob's rectangle.

**Output:**

- For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle, otherwise "No".

**Example:**

Given in the problem statement.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly implements the logic as per the problem description.

**Provided Program:**

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                (a1, a2) = (a // 2, a // 2)
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                (b1, b2) = (b // 2, b // 2)
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')
```

**My Task:**

- Determine if this program correctly solves the problem as described.

- Consider all possible edge cases and scenarios to ensure the program's correctness.

**Approach:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**

   - We have a rectangle of size a × b.

   - We can make one cut parallel to one of its sides to get two smaller rectangles.

   - We can then rearrange (rotate and move) these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

   - We need to check if it's possible to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one (considering rotations as the same).

2. **Key Insights:**

   - When we cut the rectangle, we can cut either along the length or the width.

   - After cutting, we have two rectangles, and we can arrange them in different ways to form a new rectangle.

   - We need to ensure that the new rectangle is different from the original one, considering that rotations don't make a difference.

3. **Program Logic Analysis:**

   - The program checks if either a or b is even.

   - If a is even, it cuts a into two equal parts and checks if these parts are not equal to b.

   - Similarly, if b is even, it cuts b into two equal parts and checks if these parts are not equal to a.

   - If none of these conditions are met, it prints "No".

**Potential Issues:**

- Does this logic cover all possible ways to cut and rearrange the rectangles?

- Are there cases where the cut is possible, but the program doesn't consider it?

- Are there cases where the program says "Yes" but actually, the new rectangle is the same as the original one?

- Are there cases where the program says "No" but actually, a different rectangle can be formed?

**Test Cases to Consider:**

1. **Original Rectangle: 1 × 1**

   - Cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.

   - Expected Output: "No"

2. **Original Rectangle: 2 × 1**

   - Can be cut into two 1 × 1 rectangles.

   - Arranging them can only form 1 × 2 or 2 × 1, which are the same.

   - Expected Output: "No"

3. **Original Rectangle: 2 × 6**

   - Can be cut into two 1 × 6 rectangles.

   - Arranging them can form 1 × 12 or 12 × 1, which is different from 2 × 6.

   - Expected Output: "Yes"

4. **Original Rectangle: 3 × 2**

   - Can be cut into two 1.5 × 2 rectangles, but since sides must be integers, it's invalid.

   - Alternatively, cut into two 3 × 1 rectangles.

   - Arranging them can form 3 × 2 (same as original) or 1 × 6.

   - Since 1 × 6 is different from 3 × 2, Expected Output: "Yes"

5. **Original Rectangle: 2 × 2**

   - Can be cut into two 1 × 2 rectangles.

   - Arranging them can form 1 × 4 or 4 × 1, which is different from 2 × 2.

   - Expected Output: "Yes"

6. **Original Rectangle: 2 × 4**

   - Can be cut into two 1 × 4 rectangles.

   - Arranging them can form 1 × 8 or 8 × 1, which is different from 2 × 4.

   - Expected Output: "Yes"

7. **Original Rectangle: 6 × 3**

   - Can be cut into two 3 × 3 rectangles.

   - Arranging them can form 3 × 6 (same as original) or 6 × 3 (same as original).

   - No new rectangle can be formed.

   - Expected Output: "No"

**Analyzing the Program's Output for These Cases:**

1. **1 × 1:**

   - a = 1, b = 1

   - a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0 → print "No"

   - Correct

2. **2 × 1:**

   - a = 2, b = 1

   - a % 2 == 0 → cut a into 1 and 1

   - a1 = 1, which is not equal to b (1) → wait, but in the problem, 1×2 and 2×1 are considered the same as original.

   - According to the program, it should print "Yes" because a1 != b.

   - But as per the problem, no new rectangle can be formed.

   - **Potential Issue:** Program says "Yes" but should be "No"

3. **2 × 6:**

   - a = 2, b = 6

   - a % 2 == 0 → cut a into 1 and 1

   - a1 = 1 != 6 → print "Yes"

   - Correct

4. **3 × 2:**

   - a = 3, b = 2

   - b % 2 == 0 → cut b into 1 and 1

   - b1 = 1 != 3 → print "Yes"

   - Correct

5. **2 × 2:**

   - a = 2, b = 2

   - a % 2 == 0 → cut a into 1 and 1

   - a1 = 1 != 2 → print "Yes"

   - Correct

6. **2 × 4:**

   - a = 2, b = 4

   - a % 2 == 0 → cut a into 1 and 1

   - a1 = 1 != 4 → print "Yes"

   - Correct

7. **6 × 3:**

   - a = 6, b = 3

   - a % 2 == 0 → cut a into 3 and 3

   - a1 = 3 != 3 → False

   - Then check b % 2 == 0? b = 3, which is odd → so print "No"

   - Correct

**Conclusion from Test Cases:**

- In the second test case (2×1), the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" while it should output "No".

- This indicates a flaw in the program's logic.

**Further Analysis:**

- The program checks if a or b is even.

- If a is even, it cuts a into two equal parts and checks if these parts are not equal to b.

- Similarly for b.

- However, in the 2×1 case, cutting a=2 into two 1×1 rectangles, and then arranging them can only form 1×2 or 2×1, which is the same as the original rectangle.

- Hence, no new rectangle is formed, but the program outputs "Yes".

- This suggests that the program's condition is insufficient. It needs to ensure that the new rectangle formed is different from the original one, considering rotations.

**Correct Approach:**

- To form a new rectangle different from the original, the arrangement should result in dimensions that are not equal to the original dimensions or their rotation.

- For example, in the 2×1 case, arranging two 1×1 rectangles can only form 1×2 or 2×1, which is the same as the original.

- Hence, no new rectangle is formed.

- In the 2×6 case, arranging two 1×6 rectangles can form 1×12 or 12×1, which is different from 2×6.

- Hence, a new rectangle is formed.

**Required Condition:**

- After cutting, the two smaller rectangles can be arranged to form a new rectangle with dimensions (x, y), where (x, y) is different from (a, b) and (b, a).

- This requires that x and y are not equal to a and b in any order.

- Additionally, the area must be conserved, so x * y = a * b.

**General Logic:**

- If a is even, say a = 2*k, then cutting into two k×b rectangles.

- These two can be arranged side by side to form a (k, 2*b) rectangle or stacked to form a (2*k, b) rectangle.

- Similarly, if b is even, say b = 2*k, then cutting into two a×k rectangles.

- These can be arranged to form (a, 2*k) or (2*a, k) rectangles.

- Need to check if either of these new dimensions is different from (a, b) and (b, a).

**Correct Condition:**

- If a is even:

  - New dimensions could be (a//2, 2*b) or (2*a, b//2)

  - Check if (a//2, 2*b) != (a, b) and != (b, a)

  - Similarly for (2*a, b//2)

- Similarly, if b is even.

- The program should check if any of these new dimensions are different from the original dimensions.

**Program's Flaw:**

- The program only checks if a1 != b or b1 != a, which is insufficient.

- It needs to check if the new dimensions are different from both (a, b) and (b, a).

**Fixing the Program:**

- For a even, cut into two (a//2, b) rectangles.

- These can be arranged to form either (a//2, 2*b) or (2*(a//2), b), but (2*(a//2), b) is the same as original.

- So, check if (a//2, 2*b) != (a, b) and != (b, a)

- Similarly for b even.

**Implementing the Fix:**

- For a even:

  - New dimensions: (a//2, 2*b)

  - Check if (a//2, 2*b) != (a, b) and != (b, a)

- For b even:

  - New dimensions: (2*a, b//2)

  - Check if (2*a, b//2) != (a, b) and != (b, a)

**Example:**

- In 2×1 case:

  - a = 2 (even)

  - New dimensions: (1, 2*1) = (1, 2)

  - Check if (1, 2) != (2, 1) and != (1, 2) → no, it's the same as original.

  - Hence, "No"

- In 2×6 case:

  - a = 2 (even)

  - New dimensions: (1, 12)

  - Check if (1, 12) != (2, 6) and != (6, 2) → yes, different.

  - Hence, "Yes"

**Final Solution Code:**

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the new rectangle formed after cutting and rearranging is different from the original rectangle, considering rotations. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def can_form_new_rectangle(a, b):
    # If a is even
    if a % 2 == 0:
        new_a = a // 2
        new_b = 2 * b
        # Check if the new rectangle is different from the original and its rotation
        if (new_a != a or new_b != b) and (new_a != b or new_b != a):
            return True
    # If b is even
    if b % 2 == 0:
        new_a = 2 * a
        new_b = b // 2
        # Check if the new rectangle is different from the original and its rotation
        if (new_a != a or new_b != b) and (new_a != b or new_b != a):
            return True
    return False

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        if can_form_new_rectangle(a, b):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Definition:**
   - `can_form_new_rectangle(a, b)`: This function checks if a new rectangle can be formed from the original rectangle of size `a x b` by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   
2. **Checking Even Dimensions:**
   - If `a` is even, we cut the rectangle into two parts along `a`, resulting in two rectangles of size `(a//2) x b`. These can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `(a//2) x (2*b)`.
   - If `b` is even, we cut the rectangle into two parts along `b`, resulting in two rectangles of size `a x (b//2)`. These can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `(2*a) x (b//2)`.

3. **Validation of New Rectangle:**
   - For each possible new rectangle dimension, we check if it is different from the original rectangle and its rotated version `(b x a)`.

4. **Main Function:**
   - Reads input, processes each test case, and prints "Yes" if a new rectangle can be formed, otherwise "No".

This approach ensures that we correctly identify cases where a new rectangle can be formed, considering all possible rotations and arrangements.
