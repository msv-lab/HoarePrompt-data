Alright, I've got this task here. I need to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that even if the program fails for just one input case, it's considered incorrect.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Description

We have an n x m grid consisting of white ('W') and black ('B') squares. We can perform operations where we select two squares of the same color and then color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color. The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of such operations.

### Program Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        ans = 'YES'
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        print(ans)
```

### Approach to Verification

1. **Initial Check**: The program checks if the top-left corner (gr[0][0]) and the bottom-right corner (gr[n-1][m-1]) have the same color. If they do, it assumes it's possible to make the entire grid uniform (ans = 'YES'). If they don't, it performs additional checks.

2. **Additional Checks**:
   - It checks if all elements in the first row and the last row are uniform.
   - It also checks if all elements in the first column and the last column are uniform.
   - If either of these checks fails, it sets ans to 'NO'.

3. **Output**: It prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the above checks.

### Analysis

To verify the correctness, I need to ensure that the program correctly determines whether it's possible to make the entire grid uniform according to the operation rules.

#### Key Observations

- The operation allows selecting two squares of the same color and coloring the entire subrectangle between them to that color.
- This operation can be used to propagate a color across the grid if there are connected components of that color.

#### Potential Issues

1. **Corner Cases**:
   - Grids where n=1 or m=1.
   - Grids where all squares are already the same color.
   - Grids where it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program only checks the first and last rows and columns for uniformity if gr[0][0] != gr[n-1][m-1].
   - It might not consider all possible scenarios where the grid can be made uniform.

#### Test Cases

Let's consider some test cases to validate the program.

**Test Case 1:**

Input:

```

1

2 1

W

B

```

Expected Output: NO

Explanation: The grid has two different colors in a single column. Since operations require selecting two squares of the same color, no operations can be performed, hence it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

Program Output: NO

**Test Case 2:**

Input:

```

1

1 1

W

```

Expected Output: YES

Explanation: The grid is already uniform.

Program Output: YES

**Test Case 3:**

Input:

```

1

2 2

BB

BB

```

Expected Output: YES

Explanation: The grid is already uniform.

Program Output: YES

**Test Case 4:**

Input:

```

1

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

```

Expected Output: YES

Explanation: All rows and columns alternate colors, but operations can be performed to make the grid uniform.

Program Output: YES

**Test Case 5:**

Input:

```

1

4 2

BB

BB

WW

WW

```

Expected Output: NO

Explanation: The grid has two blocks of 'BB' and 'WW'. Since 'B' and 'W' are different, and operations can only be performed within the same color, it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

Program Output: NO

**Test Case 6:**

Input:

```

1

4 4

WWBW

BBWB

WWBB

BBBB

```

Expected Output: YES

Explanation: It's possible to perform operations to make the entire grid 'B' or 'W'.

Program Output: YES

**Test Case 7:**

Input:

```

1

1 5

WBBWB

```

Expected Output: NO

Explanation: The grid has alternating 'W' and 'B', and it's impossible to make it uniform.

Program Output: NO

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it seems that the program correctly determines whether it's possible to make the entire grid uniform according to the problem's operation rules. The additional checks for the first and last rows and columns ensure that if the corners are different, but the rows and columns are uniform, it correctly identifies impossibility.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
