Alright, I have been assigned the role of a program verifier. My task is to determine whether a given Python program correctly solves the problem described. If the program is correct for all potential cases, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to ensure that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every possible input case. If there's even a single case where the program doesn't work as expected, it should be considered incorrect.

To understand this task better, I've been provided with some examples.

**Example 1:**

- **Problem Description:** Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- **Program:**

  ```python

  def is_not_prime(n):

      if n < 2:

          return True

      for i in range(2, n):

          if n % i == 0:

              return True

      return False

  ```

- **Example Answer:** Correctness: **True**

This seems straightforward. The function checks if a number is not prime by returning True if the number is less than 2 or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. This appears to be correct.

**Example 2:**

- **Problem Description:** Write a Python function to count all substrings starting and ending with the same character.

- **Program:**

  ```python

  def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

      count = 0

      for i in range(len(s)-1):

          for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

              if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                  count += 1

      return count

  ```

- **Example Answer:** Correctness: **False**

I need to think about why this might be incorrect. The function iterates through the string and counts substrings where the first and last characters are the same. However, there might be an issue with the way it's indexing or counting the substrings. For example, if the string is "abc", it might not count all possible substrings correctly. I need to verify this.

**Example 3:**

- **Problem Description:** Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- **Program:**

  ```python

  def binary_search(arr, target):

      left = 0

      right = len(arr) - 1

      while left < right:

          mid = (left + right) // 2

          if arr[mid] == target:

              return mid

          elif arr[mid] < target:

              left = mid

          else:

              right = mid - 1

      if arr[left] == target:

          return left

      return -1

  ```

- **Example Answer:** Correctness: **False**

This binary search implementation seems flawed. In a standard binary search, when `arr[mid] < target`, we should set `left = mid + 1` to avoid infinite loops. Here, `left = mid` might cause the loop to continue indefinitely if the target is not found. This is likely why it's considered incorrect.

Now, moving on to my actual task:

**Problem Description:**

Given two positive integers `n` and `m`, calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` satisfying:

- `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`

- `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`

Input:

- The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`)

- Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (`1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6`)

- It is guaranteed that neither the sum of `n` nor the sum of `m` over all test cases exceeds `2 * 10^6`

Output:

- For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example:

Input:

```

6

1 1

2 3

3 5

10 8

100 1233

1000000 1145141

```

Output:

```

1

3

4

14

153

1643498

```

Note:

In the first test case, only `(1,1)` satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, `(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)` satisfy the conditions.

**Program:**

The provided code seems to be a collection of various functions, but it's not clear which function is intended to solve the given problem. The last function call `func_16()` is present, which in turn calls `func_15()` for each test case. So, I need to focus on `func_15()` to see if it solves the problem correctly.

Looking at `func_15()`:

```python

def func_15():

    (n, m) = func_7()

    i = 1

    ans = 0

    while i * i <= n + i:

        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)

        i += 1

    return ans - 1

```

And `func_7()` is defined as:

```python

def func_7():

    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]

```

So, `func_15()` reads two integers `n` and `m`, but only uses `n` and `i` in its calculations, ignoring `m`. This seems suspicious because the problem depends on both `n` and `m`.

Wait, perhaps I misidentified the function. Let me check the code again.

Looking back, the main function is `func_16()`, which calls `func_15()` for each test case.

```python

def func_16():

    for _ in range(func_10()):

        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')

```

And `func_10()` is:

```python

def func_10():

    return int(input())

```

So, `func_16()` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_15()` that many times, printing the result each time.

But in `func_15()`, it reads `n` and `m` using `func_7()`, but only uses `n` and `i` in its calculations, ignoring `m`. This seems incorrect because the problem clearly depends on both `n` and `m`.

Let me look at the logic inside `func_15()`:

- It initializes `i` to 1.

- It has a loop that runs while `i * i <= n + i`.

- In each iteration, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.

- It increments `i` by 1 each time.

- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

This logic doesn't seem to relate directly to the problem of counting pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Given this discrepancy, it's likely that the program is incorrect because it doesn't correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.

However, to be thorough, I should check if there's any way this code could still produce the correct output by coincidence.

Looking at the example inputs and outputs:

- For `n=1`, `m=1`, output is `1`.

- For `n=2`, `m=3`, output is `3`.

- For `n=3`, `m=5`, output is `4`.

- For `n=10`, `m=8`, output is `14`.

- For `n=100`, `m=1233`, output is `153`.

- For `n=1000000`, `m=1145141`, output is `1643498`.

I need to verify if `func_15()` produces these outputs for the corresponding `n` and `m`.

But since `func_15()` ignores `m`, it's unlikely to produce the correct outputs that depend on both `n` and `m`.

Therefore, I can conclude that the program is incorrect because it doesn't correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs based on both `n` and `m`.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
