Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from his original rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them. The program needs to output "Yes" if it's possible and "No" otherwise.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Bob has a rectangle of size a x b. He can make one cut parallel to one of the sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles. Then, he can rearrange these two rectangles (by rotating or moving them) to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle should be different from the original one in terms of its dimensions, considering that rotations are considered the same. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and then rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 (or 6x2) rectangle.

My task is to verify if the given program correctly implements this logic for all possible test cases.

Let's look at the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

I need to analyze this code step by step and see if it correctly handles all possible scenarios as per the problem description.

First, the program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the values of a and b.

The logic seems to be based on the parity of a and b and some conditions involving their differences.

Let's break it down:

1. If both a and b are even, it prints 'yes'.

2. Then there's an elif condition that checks `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`. This seems confusing. The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` is a tuple with two elements: the result of `a - b == -a` and the value of a. Similarly for the other part. I think this might be a mistake, possibly intended to be separate conditions but written incorrectly.

3. The next condition checks if `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`. This seems to check if the difference is odd, but since modulo operation with 2 can only be 0 or 1, `(a - b) % 2` can only be 0 or 1, so `(a - b) % 2 < 0` would always be False. Maybe the intention was to check if the difference is odd.

4. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no'.

Given this, the logic seems flawed. Let's think about the correct approach.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider how Bob can cut the rectangle and then rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

First, Bob can make one cut parallel to one of the sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles. Then, he can arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

Let's consider the possible ways to cut the rectangle:

- Cut parallel to the side of length a: This would result in two rectangles of size (a/x) x b, where x is the position of the cut.

- Cut parallel to the side of length b: This would result in two rectangles of size a x (b/y), where y is the position of the cut.

Then, Bob can arrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle must have integer side lengths, and rotations are considered the same.

The key is to check if, after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle has different dimensions from the original one.

Let's think about some examples:

1. For a 2x6 rectangle:

- Cut parallel to a: say cut at 1, resulting in two 1x6 rectangles. These can be arranged to form a 1x12 or 12x1 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

- Cut parallel to b: cut at 3, resulting in two 2x3 rectangles. These can be arranged to form a 4x3 or 3x4 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a new rectangle, so the answer is 'Yes'.

2. For a 1x1 rectangle:

- Cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, so no new rectangle can be formed. Answer is 'No'.

3. For a 2x1 rectangle:

- Cut parallel to a: cut at 1, resulting in two 1x1 rectangles. These can be arranged to form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original when considering rotations. So, no new rectangle can be formed. Answer is 'No'.

4. For a 3x2 rectangle:

- Cut parallel to a: cut at 1, resulting in two 1x2 rectangles. These can be arranged to form a 1x4 or 4x1 rectangle, which is different from 3x2.

- Cut parallel to b: cut at 1, resulting in two 3x1 rectangles. These can be arranged to form a 3x2 or 2x3 rectangle, which is the same as the original when considering rotations.

So, in this case, cutting parallel to a allows forming a new rectangle, so answer is 'Yes'.

From these examples, it seems that if at least one of the sides is even, it's possible to form a new rectangle. But let's verify this.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, both sides are even (2 is even, 1 is odd), and the answer is 'No'. So that doesn't hold.

Wait, 2 is even, 1 is odd, but in the problem, for 2x1, the answer is 'No'.

Wait, in the example output, for 2x1, it's 'No'.

But according to the initial thought, if at least one side is even, it's 'Yes', but in this case, 2 is even, but the answer is 'No'. So that thought is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the condition is that both a and b are not both odd. If both are odd, then it's 'No', else 'Yes'. But in the 2x1 case, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd), and the answer is 'No'. So that doesn't hold.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd), and answer is 'No'. In the 2x2 case, a=2 (even), b=2 (even), answer is 'Yes'. In the 3x2 case, a=3 (odd), b=2 (even), answer is 'Yes'. In the 1x1 case, a=1 (odd), b=1 (odd), answer is 'No'.

So, when both a and b are odd, answer is 'No'. When at least one is even, answer is 'Yes', except for some cases like 2x1.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, at least one is even, but answer is 'No'. So that suggests that the condition is not just about at least one being even.

Let me consider the general case.

Suppose we have a rectangle of size a x b.

If we make a cut parallel to side a, we get two rectangles of size (a/x) x b.

Similarly, cutting parallel to side b gives two rectangles of size a x (b/y).

Then, we can arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

The area of the original rectangle is a*b, and the new rectangle must also have area a*b.

So, the possible dimensions of the new rectangle are pairs of factors of a*b.

But, we need to ensure that the new rectangle has different dimensions from the original, considering rotations.

So, if the original rectangle is a x b, then any new rectangle must be c x (a*b)/c, where c is a factor of a*b, and c != a and c != b.

Wait, but we have constraints because the two smaller rectangles must fit into this new rectangle.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have two smaller rectangles, each of size a/x x b or a x b/y.

We need to arrange these two to form a new rectangle of size c x d, where c*d = a*b, and c != a or d != b.

The way to arrange two smaller rectangles to form a new one is by placing them side by side or one on top of the other.

So, for example, if we have two rectangles of size p x q, we can arrange them to form either a (p x 2q) or (2p x q) rectangle.

Applying this to our cuts:

- If we cut parallel to a, resulting in two (a/x) x b rectangles, we can arrange them to form either (a/x) x 2b or (2*a/x) x b.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for 2x6, cutting parallel to a at 1, giving two 1x6 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 1x12 or 2x6. But 2x6 is the original, so only 1x12 is a new rectangle.

Similarly, cutting parallel to b at 3, giving two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 4x3 or 2x6, where 2x6 is original, so 4x3 is new.

So, in this case, both ways of cutting allow forming a new rectangle.

In the 2x1 case:

- Cutting parallel to a at 1, giving two 1x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 1x2 or 2x1, which is the same as the original when considering rotations. So, no new rectangle.

- Cutting parallel to b at 0.5 isn't possible since b=1 and cuts must be integer.

Hence, in this case, no new rectangle can be formed.

So, the key is to check if there exists at least one way of cutting and rearranging that results in a new rectangle with different dimensions from the original, considering rotations.

Now, back to the program. The program has conditions based on the parity of a and b, but it seems flawed.

Let's see:

- If both a and b are even, it prints 'yes'.

- Then there's a confusing elif condition involving tuples.

- Then it checks if the difference (a - b) % 2 is greater than 0 or less than 0.

Given that modulo 2 can only be 0 or 1, (a - b) % 2 can only be 0 or 1, so (a - b) % 2 < 0 will always be False.

So, this condition simplifies to whether (a - b) % 2 > 0, which means if the difference is odd.

But, as seen in the examples, this doesn't directly correlate to whether a new rectangle can be formed.

I think the program is incorrect because it doesn't correctly capture the logic needed to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

Let me try to think of a correct approach.

From the earlier analysis, it seems that if either a or b is even, and the other is such that a new rectangle can be formed, then the answer is 'Yes'. But, as seen in the 2x1 case, it's not always the case.

Wait, maybe the correct condition is that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is greater than 1.

But in the 2x1 case, GCD is 1, and answer is 'No'.

In the 2x2 case, GCD is 2, answer is 'Yes'.

In the 3x2 case, GCD is 1, answer is 'Yes'.

Wait, this doesn't hold for all cases.

Wait, maybe the condition is that a and b are not both odd.

But in the 2x1 case, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd), answer is 'No'.

In the 2x2 case, a=2 (even), b=2 (even), answer is 'Yes'.

In the 3x2 case, a=3 (odd), b=2 (even), answer is 'Yes'.

So, when at least one is even, answer is 'Yes', except for the 2x1 case.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the condition is that a*b is even, and a != b.

But in the 2x1 case, a*b is even, and a != b, but answer is 'No'.

Wait, no, in the 2x1 case, answer is 'No'.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that a and b are not coprime, meaning GCD(a,b) > 1.

In the 2x2 case, GCD=2, answer='Yes'.

In the 3x2 case, GCD=1, answer='Yes'.

In the 2x1 case, GCD=1, answer='No'.

Wait, this doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe it's that a and b are not both odd and not equal.

But in the 1x1 case, both odd and equal, answer='No'.

In the 2x1 case, not both odd, but answer='No'.

Wait, seems inconsistent.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for a new rectangle to be formed, there must be a way to arrange the two smaller rectangles into a different configuration.

Given that rotations are allowed, and considering that the new rectangle must have different dimensions from the original, perhaps the key is to check if there exists a non-trivial way to arrange the two smaller rectangles.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a and b share a common factor greater than 1, but that doesn't seem to hold for all cases.

Let me consider the general condition.

Suppose we have a rectangle of size a x b.

After cutting, we have two smaller rectangles.

Let's say we cut parallel to side a, resulting in two rectangles of size (a/x) x b.

Then, arranging them, we can form a rectangle of size (a/x) x 2b or (2*a/x) x b.

Similarly, if we cut parallel to side b, resulting in two rectangles of size a x (b/y), we can form a rectangle of size a x (2*b/y) or (2*a) x (b/y).

Now, for these new rectangles to be different from the original, their dimensions must not match the original dimensions, considering rotations.

So, for the new rectangle to be different, neither of its dimensions should match the original dimensions.

Wait, more precisely, the sorted dimensions of the new rectangle should not match the sorted dimensions of the original rectangle.

Because rotations are considered the same.

So, for the new rectangle c x d, if sorted([c,d]) != sorted([a,b]), then it's a different rectangle.

Given that, let's consider the possible new rectangles:

1. From cutting parallel to a:

- Option 1: (a/x) x 2b

- Option 2: (2*a/x) x b

But (2*a/x) x b is the same as a x (2*b), which might not be valid.

Wait, I need to think in terms of tiling the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.

Actually, it's more about the combination of the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle with integer sides.

I think a better way is to consider that after cutting, the two smaller rectangles must be rearranged to form a new rectangle with area a*b, and different dimensions from the original.

Given that, perhaps the condition is that at least one of a or b is even, but considering the 2x1 case, which is even in one dimension, but answer is 'No'.

Wait, maybe the condition is that a and b are not both odd, but in the 2x1 case, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd), answer is 'No'.

Wait, but in the 3x2 case, a=3 (odd), b=2 (even), answer is 'Yes'.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that max(a,b)/min(a,b) is not equal to 1 and at least one of them is even.

But in the 2x1 case, max=2, min=1, ratio=2, which is not 1, and a is even, but answer is 'No'.

Still doesn't hold.

This is getting tricky.

Let me look at the example outputs again:

- 1 1: No

- 2 1: No

- 2 6: Yes

- 3 2: Yes

- 2 2: Yes

- 2 4: Yes

- 6 3: No

Wait, in the 6x3 case, which is similar to 2x3 (since 6=2*3), and in the example, answer is 'No'.

But according to the earlier thought, it should be 'Yes'.

Wait, but in the example, it's 'No'. So perhaps my earlier thought is incorrect.

Wait, in the 6x3 case, you can cut parallel to a:

- Cut at 3, giving two 3x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 3x6 (same as original) or 6x3 (same as original).

- Cut parallel to b: cut at 1, giving two 6x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 6x2 or 12x1, both of which are different from the original 6x3.

But in the example, the answer is 'No'. So perhaps in this specific case, it's considered 'No', meaning that only cuts that result in new rectangles that are different from the original are considered.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, in the 6x3 case, cutting into two 6x1 rectangles and forming a 12x1 rectangle, which is different from the original, should be 'Yes'.

But in the example, it's 'No'. So perhaps there's something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from the original dimensions, not just one.

For example, in the 6x3 case, forming a 12x1 rectangle, which is different from 6x3, but perhaps it's considered 'No' because 12x1 can be rotated to 1x12, which is still different.

Wait, but according to the problem, rotations are considered the same. So, 12x1 and 1x12 are considered the same rectangle.

And since this is different from the original 6x3, it should be 'Yes'.

But in the example, it's 'No'. So perhaps the condition is more restrictive.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from the original dimensions.

In the 6x3 case, forming a 12x1 rectangle, which is different in both dimensions from 6x3, should be 'Yes', but the example says 'No'.

Wait, maybe I misread the example output.

Looking back at the example output:

7

1 1 No

2 1 No

2 6 Yes

3 2 Yes

2 2 Yes

2 4 Yes

6 3 No

So, in the 6x3 case, it's 'No'. But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be 'Yes'. So perhaps my reasoning is flawed.

Let me think again.

In the 6x3 case:

- Cut parallel to a (length 6):

- Cut at 3: two 3x3 rectangles.

- Arranging them: 3x6 (same as original) or 6x3 (same as original).

- Cut at 1: two 1x3 rectangles.

- Arranging them: 1x6 or 2x3.

- 1x6 is the same as 6x1, which is different from original 6x3.

- 2x3 is different from 6x3.

But according to the example, the answer is 'No'. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the new rectangle must be different from the original one, considering that rotations are the same, and in this case, 2x3 is considered the same as 3x2, which might be equivalent to the original 6x3, which is 3x2 scaled by 2.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the aspect ratio remains the same, so 6x3 and 2x3 have the same aspect ratio.

Wait, no, 6x3 is equivalent to 2x1, and 2x3 is different.

But in terms of forming a new rectangle, if we can form a 2x3 from a 6x3, which is different, it should be 'Yes'.

But according to the example, it's 'No'. So perhaps the condition is more specific.

Wait, maybe the condition is that after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from the original dimensions, and not just one.

But in the 6x3 case, forming a 2x3, which is different in both dimensions from 6x3, but still, the answer is 'No'.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the new rectangle must have area equal to the original but different dimensions, and that the new dimensions are not proportional to the original dimensions.

Wait, in the 6x3 case, any new rectangle formed must have area 18, but not be 6x3 or 3x6.

But in the 2x6 case, forming a 4x3, which is different and not proportional to 2x6.

Wait, 2x6 and 4x3 have the same area, but 4x3 is not proportional to 2x6, so it's a different rectangle.

In the 6x3 case, forming a 2x3, which is different and not proportional to 6x3.

But according to the example, it's 'No', so perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe in the 6x3 case, it's impossible to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

But earlier, I thought it's possible to form a 2x3 rectangle, which is different.

Wait, perhaps the cuts don't allow forming a 2x3 from a 6x3 rectangle.

Let me check:

- Cut parallel to a (length 6):

- Cut at 3: two 3x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 3x6 or 6x3, which are the same as the original.

- Cut at 1: two 1x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form 1x6 or 2x3.

- 1x6 is the same as 6x1, which is different from original 6x3.

- 2x3 is different from 6x3.

But according to the example, the answer is 'No', so perhaps in this specific case, forming 1x6 or 2x3 is not considered a different rectangle.

Wait, maybe because 2x3 is proportional to 6x3 (since 2*3=6*1), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, 2x3 and 6x3 are not proportional because 2/6 != 3/3.

Wait, 2/6 = 1/3 and 3/3 =1, which are not equal, so they are not proportional.

So, they are different rectangles.

But according to the example, it's 'No', so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the new rectangle must not only be different but also have integer sides, and perhaps in some cases, it's not possible
