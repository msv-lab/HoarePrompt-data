Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets all the requirements for every possible input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all edge cases to ensure the program is completely correct.

First, I need to understand the problem description fully. The problem is about having a horizontal strip of n cells, each either white ('W') or black ('B'). The goal is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment to paint white so that, after painting, all cells become white. Painting a segment white means that all 'B's in that segment become 'W's, and 'W's remain 'W's.

The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, there's an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W's and 'B's. There's at least one 'B' in the string.

The output should be the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white for each test case.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

8

6

WBBWBW

1

B

2

WB

3

BBW

4

BWWB

6

BWBWWB

6

WWBBWB

9

WBWBWWWBW

Output:

4

1

1

2

4

6

4

7

I need to understand what the correct approach should be to solve this problem.

Let me think about the problem logically. To make all cells 'W', I need to cover all 'B's with a single painting action on a continuous segment. The goal is to find the smallest such segment that covers all 'B's.

One way to think about it is to find the smallest window that includes all 'B's in the string. So, find the first 'B' from the left and the last 'B' from the right, and the segment between them should be painted white. The length of this segment would be from the first 'B' to the last 'B', inclusive.

Let me see if this logic matches the example:

For the first test case:

n = 6

s = WBBWBW

First 'B' is at index 1 (0-based), last 'B' is at index 4.

So, the segment from index 1 to 4, which is of length 4. And the output is 4, which matches.

Second test case:

n = 1

s = B

First 'B' at index 0, last 'B' at index 0.

Segment of length 1. Output is 1.

Third test case:

n = 2

s = WB

First 'B' at index 1, last 'B' at index 1.

Segment of length 1. Output is 1.

Fourth test case:

n = 3

s = BBW

First 'B' at index 0, last 'B' at index 1.

Segment from 0 to 1, length 2. Output is 2.

Fifth test case:

n = 4

s = BWWB

First 'B' at index 0, last 'B' at index 3.

Segment from 0 to 3, length 4. Output is 4.

Sixth test case:

n = 6

s = BWBWWB

First 'B' at index 0, last 'B' at index 5.

Segment from 0 to 5, length 6. Output is 6.

Seventh test case:

n = 6

s = WWBBWB

First 'B' at index 2, last 'B' at index 5.

Segment from 2 to 5, length 4. Output is 4.

Eighth test case:

n = 9

s = WBWBWWWBW

First 'B' at index 1, last 'B' at index 8.

Segment from 1 to 8, length 8. But the output is 7. Wait, this doesn't match my logic.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the indices. Let's check:

s = W B W B W W W B W

Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

First 'B' at index 1, last 'B' at index 7.

So, segment from 1 to 7, which is length 7. Output is 7. Okay, my logic seems correct.

So, the general approach is:

- Find the index of the first 'B' from the left (ind1).

- Find the index of the last 'B' from the right (ind2).

- The minimum segment to paint is from ind1 to ind2, inclusive.

- The length of this segment is ind2 - ind1 + 1.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```

def func():

    inpstr = input()

    ind1 = 0

    ind2 = 0

    outind = 0

    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):

        if j == 'B':

            ind1 = i

            break

    for i in range(len(inpstr)):

        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':

            ind2 = i

            break

    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)

```

Let's analyze this code step by step.

- It reads the input string.

- It finds the index of the first 'B' from the left and stores it in ind1.

- It finds the index of the first 'B' from the right and stores it in ind2.

- It calculates the length as len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 and prints it.

Wait a minute, is this calculating the correct segment length?

Let me verify with an example.

Take s = WBBWBW

n = 6

First 'B' at index 1 (ind1 = 1)

Last 'B' at index 4 (ind2 = 4)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 6 - 4 - 1 = 1

But according to the example, the output should be 4.

This is not matching. So, there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

ind2 is found by iterating from the end:

for i in range(len(inpstr)):

if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':

ind2 = i

break

So, for s = WBBWBW, len(inpstr) = 6

Checking from the end:

i=0: inpstr[-1] = W → skip

i=1: inpstr[-2] = B → ind2 = 1

So, ind2 = 1

Then, len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4, which matches the example.

Wait, in this case, it's correct.

Let me check another example.

n=3, s=BBW

First 'B' at index 0 (ind1=0)

Last 'B' at index 1 (ind2=1)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 3 - 1 - 0 = 2, which matches the example output of 2.

Another example:

n=4, s=BWWB

ind1=0, ind2=3

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 4 - 3 - 0 = 1, but the example output is 4.

Wait, this doesn't match. According to my earlier logic, it should be from index 0 to 3, length 4, but according to the code, it's 1, which doesn't match the example output of 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the calculation.

Looking back at the code:

print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)

For s=BWWB, ind1=0, ind2=3, len(inpstr)=4

4 - 3 - 0 = 1, but the example output is 4.

This is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps ind2 is not what I think it is.

Wait, in the code, ind2 is set to i when inpstr[-i-1] == 'B', where i starts from 0.

So, for s=BWWB, indices: 0:B,1:W,2:W,3:B

Checking from the end:

i=0: inpstr[-1] = B → ind2=0

Then, len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 4 - 0 - 0 = 4, which matches the example output.

Wait, earlier I miscalculated ind2.

So, for s=BWWB:

ind1=0 (first 'B' from left)

ind2=0 (last 'B' from right)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 4 - 0 - 0 = 4, which matches the example output of 4.

Similarly, for s=WBBWBW:

ind1=1, ind2=1 (since the last 'B' is at index 4, which is -2 from the end, but i=1)

Wait, no:

for i in range(len(inpstr)):

if inpstr[-i-1] == 'B':

ind2 = i

break

For s=WBBWBW:

indices: 0:W,1:B,2:B,3:W,4:B,5:W

Checking from the end:

i=0: inpstr[-1] = W → skip

i=1: inpstr[-2] = B → ind2=1

So, ind2=1

Then, len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4, which matches the example output.

Another test case:

n=1, s=B

ind1=0, ind2=0

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 1 - 0 - 0 = 1, matches output 1.

n=2, s=WB

ind1=1, ind2=0 (since last 'B' is at index 1, which is -1 from the end, i=0)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 2 - 0 - 1 = 1, matches output 1.

n=3, s=BBW

ind1=0, ind2=1 (last 'B' is at index 1, which is -2 from the end, i=1)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 3 - 1 - 0 = 2, matches output 2.

n=4, s=BWWB

ind1=0, ind2=0 (last 'B' at index 3, which is -1 from the end, i=0)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 4 - 0 - 0 = 4, matches output 4.

n=6, s=BWBWWB

ind1=0, ind2=0 (last 'B' at index 5, which is -1 from the end, i=0)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 6 - 0 - 0 = 6, matches output 6.

n=6, s=WWBBWB

ind1=2, ind2=1 (last 'B' at index 5, which is -1 from the end, i=0)

Wait, for s=WWBBWB:

indices: 0:W,1:W,2:B,3:B,4:W,5:B

Finding ind2:

for i in range(len(inpstr)):

if inpstr[-i-1] == 'B':

ind2 = i

break

i=0: inpstr[-1] = B → ind2=0

Then, len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 6 - 0 - 2 = 4, matches output 4.

n=9, s=WBWBWWWBW

ind1=1, ind2=7 (since last 'B' at index 7, which is -2 from the end, i=1)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 9 - 1 - 1 = 7, matches output 7.

So, in all these cases, it seems to work correctly.

But wait, is this logic correct in general?

Let me try to generalize it.

ind1 is the index of the first 'B' from the left.

ind2 is the distance from the end to the first 'B' from the right, minus one because of the way it's calculated.

Wait, ind2 is set to i when inpstr[-i-1] == 'B', so ind2 is the number of steps from the end to the last 'B'.

Then, len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 should give the length of the segment from ind1 to len(inpstr) - ind2 -1.

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way to understand it.

Let me think differently.

The segment to be painted white should cover all 'B's. So, the minimal segment is from the first 'B' to the last 'B'.

If I have the index of the first 'B' (ind1) and the index of the last 'B' (ind_last), then the length of the segment is ind_last - ind1 + 1.

But in the code, it's calculating len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1, where ind2 is the distance from the end to the last 'B'.

Wait, in the earlier examples, it seems to work, but is it general?

Let me consider a case where all cells are 'B's.

n=5, s=BBBBB

ind1=0, ind2=0 (since last 'B' is at index 4, which is -1 from the end, i=0)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 5 - 0 - 0 = 5, which is correct, since the entire strip needs to be painted.

Another case: n=4, s=WWWW

But according to the problem, there's at least one 'B', so this case isn't possible.

Another case: n=2, s=BB

ind1=0, ind2=0 (last 'B' at index 1, which is -1 from the end, i=0)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 2 - 0 - 0 = 2, which is correct.

Another case: n=5, s=WBWBW

ind1=1, ind2=1 (last 'B' at index 3, which is -2 from the end, i=1)

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3, which should be correct, as the segment from index 1 to 3 covers all 'B's.

Wait, but is there a case where this logic fails?

Let me think about a case where 'B's are scattered, but not contiguous.

For example: n=5, s=WBWBW

As above, ind1=1, ind2=1, len=5 -1 -1=3, which is correct.

Another case: n=4, s=BWBW

ind1=0, ind2=0 (last 'B' at index 3, which is -1 from the end, i=0)

len=4 -0 -0=4, which is correct.

Another case: n=5, s=WWBWW

ind1=2, ind2=2 (last 'B' at index 2, which is -3 from the end, i=2)

len=5 -2 -2=1, but actually, to cover the single 'B' at index 2, the segment length should be 1, which is correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but in the earlier confusion with n=4, s=BWWB, I thought ind2=0, but according to the calculation, it's correct.

Maybe I was mistaken earlier.

So, perhaps the formula len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 is equivalent to ind_last - ind_first +1.

Let me verify that.

Given ind1 = index of first 'B'

ind2 = distance from end to the last 'B'

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = n - ind2 - ind1

But ind2 is the index from the end, so ind_last = n - ind2 -1

Therefore, ind_last - ind1 +1 = (n - ind2 -1) - ind1 +1 = n - ind2 - ind1

Which matches the formula in the code.

So, len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = ind_last - ind_first +1, which is the correct segment length.

Therefore, the code is correct.

I can't find any case where this logic fails.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
