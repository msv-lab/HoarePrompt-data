Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements for every possible input case. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I have to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Description

Nikita has some cubes and wants to build a tower using them. He can perform two types of moves:

1. **Add** one cube to the top of the tower.
2. **Remove** one cube from the top of the tower.

The tower starts with no cubes. After a series of `n` moves, we need to determine if it's possible for the tower to have exactly `m` cubes.

### Input

- The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

### Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, otherwise "No".

### Example

**Input:**

```

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

```

**Output:**

```

Yes

No

Yes

```

### Provided Program

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Analysis

First, I need to understand what the program is doing and whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Program Logic

The program reads an integer `kreker`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1()`, which reads two integers `n` and `m` and checks if `n >= m`. If so, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

#### Potential Issues

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The condition `n >= m` might not correctly capture the possibilities of adding and removing cubes.
2. **Edge Cases**: There might be specific scenarios where this condition fails.

I need to think about how the operations affect the tower's height.

### Correct Approach

Let's think about the problem step by step.

- **Adding a cube** increases the tower's height by 1.
- **Removing a cube** decreases the tower's height by 1, but only if the tower has at least one cube.

The goal is to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Key Observations

1. **Maximum Height**: The maximum possible height after `n` moves is `n` (by only adding cubes).
2. **Minimum Height**: The minimum possible height is `0` (by removing a cube each time, but limited by the current height).
3. **Parity Consideration**: Each remove operation undoes an add operation. So, the net effect of one add and one remove is zero change in height.

To reach a height of `m` after `n` moves, we need to consider the sequence of adds and removes.

#### Possible Scenarios

1. **If `n >= m` and `n - m` is even**: This is because each remove operation effectively cancels out an add operation.
   - For example, to reach `m = 3` in `n = 5` moves:
     - Add, Add, Add, Remove, Add → height = 3
     - Here, we have 4 adds and 1 remove, but that's not balanced.
     - Correct balancing: Add, Add, Add, Remove, Add (which might not result in m=3).
   - Need a better way to think about it.

2. **General Formula**:
   - Let `a` be the number of add operations.
   - Let `r` be the number of remove operations.
   - We have `a + r = n` (total moves).
   - The height `h = a - r` (since each remove decreases the height by 1).
   - We need `h = m`.

   From these equations:
   - `a - r = m`
   - `a + r = n`

   Solving these:
   - `2a = n + m => a = (n + m)/2`
   - `r = n - a = (n - m)/2`

   For `a` and `r` to be non-negative integers:
   - `(n + m)` must be even.
   - `(n + m)/2 >= 0`
   - `(n - m)/2 >= 0`

   Therefore, the conditions are:
   - `n + m` is even.
   - `n >= m`
   - `n - m` is even.

Wait, let's verify this.

### Correct Conditions

From the equations:
- `a = (n + m)/2`
- `r = (n - m)/2`

Both `a` and `r` must be non-negative integers.

Therefore:
1. `n + m` must be even.
2. `n - m` must be even.
3. `n >= m` (since `r >= 0`)

But actually, since `n + m` and `n - m` both being even is equivalent to `n` and `m` being both even or both odd.

So, the correct condition is:
- `n >= m`
- `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd).

### Checking the Provided Program

The provided program only checks if `n >= m`. It doesn't check if `n` and `m` have the same parity.

#### Test Cases

Let's think of some test cases to verify this.

1. **n = 3, m = 3**
   - `n >= m` is true.
   - `n` and `m` both odd.
   - Should be "Yes".
   - Program outputs "Yes".

2. **n = 2, m = 4**
   - `n >= m` is false.
   - Program outputs "No".
   - But according to correct conditions, `n + m = 6` (even), `n - m = -2` (even), but `n < m`. So, should be "No".

3. **n = 5, m = 3**
   - `n >= m` is true.
   - `n` and `m` both odd.
   - Should be "Yes".
   - Program outputs "Yes".

4. **n = 4, m = 2**
   - `n >= m` is true.
   - `n` and `m` both even.
   - Should be "Yes".
   - Program outputs "Yes".

5. **n = 3, m = 2**
   - `n >= m` is true.
   - `n` odd, `m` even.
   - Parity different, should be "No".
   - Program outputs "Yes" (incorrect).

6. **n = 1, m = 1**
   - `n >= m` is true.
   - Both odd.
   - Should be "Yes".
   - Program outputs "Yes".

7. **n = 1, m = 0**
   - `n >= m` is true.
   - `n` odd, `m` even.
   - Parity different, should be "No".
   - Program outputs "Yes" (incorrect).

8. **n = 2, m = 0**
   - `n >= m` is true.
   - Both even.
   - Should be "Yes".
   - Program outputs "Yes".

From these test cases, we can see that the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for cases where `n >= m` is true, but `n` and `m` have different parities.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it doesn't account for the parity condition. There are cases where `n >= m` is true, but `n` and `m` have different parities, making it impossible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Final Answer

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
