Alright, I've been assigned the role of a program verifier. My task is to determine whether a given Python program correctly solves the problem as described. If the program is correct for all potential cases, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to ensure that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handle all edge cases appropriately.

To understand this task better, I've been provided with a few examples.

**Example 1:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:

  ```python

  def is_not_prime(n):

      if n < 2:

          return True

      for i in range(2, n):

          if n % i == 0:

              return True

      return False

  ```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **True**

This seems straightforward. The function checks if a number is not prime by returning True for numbers less than 2 and for numbers divisible by any integer between 2 and n-1.

**Example 2:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to count all substrings starting and ending with the same character.

- Program:

  ```python

  def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

      count = 0

      for i in range(len(s)-1):

          for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

              if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                  count += 1

      return count

  ```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

I need to think about why this might be incorrect. The function seems to iterate through all possible substrings and count those that start and end with the same character. However, there might be an issue with the indices or perhaps it's missing some substrings. For example, single-character substrings should also be counted, but in this code, it only considers substrings of length 2 or more because it runs until len(s)-1. Maybe that's why it's incorrect.

**Example 3:**

- Problem Description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- Program:

  ```python

  def binary_search(arr, target):

      left = 0

      right = len(arr) - 1

      while left < right:

          mid = (left + right) // 2

          if arr[mid] == target:

              return mid

          elif arr[mid] < target:

              left = mid

          else:

              right = mid - 1

      if arr[left] == target:

          return left

      return -1

  ```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

This binary search implementation seems flawed. In the case where arr[mid] < target, setting left = mid might not be sufficient because mid could be equal to left, leading to an infinite loop. Also, the final check after the loop might not cover all cases. Perhaps a better approach is to set left = mid + 1 when arr[mid] < target and right = mid - 1 when arr[mid] > target.

Now, moving on to my actual task:

**Problem Description:**

There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1 to n. Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i-th container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Pour any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j (i.e., i < j). Any index can be chosen as i or j any number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using this operation.

**Input:**

- The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

  - The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) — the number of containers.

  - The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 * 10^9. Also, the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

**Output:**

- For each test case, output "YES" if it's possible to make the amount of water the same in all containers, otherwise "NO".

**Example:**

(Input and Output as provided)

**Program to Verify:**

```python

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

    n = int(input())

    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):

    n = len(nums)

    total = sum(nums)

    if total % n != 0:

        return 'NO'

    mean = total // n

    curr = 0

    for i in range(n):

        curr += nums[i] - mean

        if curr < 0:

            return 'NO'

    return 'YES'

```

**My Task:**

Determine if this program correctly solves the problem for all possible input cases.

**Approach to Verification:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**

   - We have n containers with initial amounts a_i.

   - We can only pour water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one.

   - The total sum is divisible by n, so the target amount for each container is sum/n.

   - Determine if it's possible to make all containers have this target amount using the allowed operations.

2. **Analyze the Program:**

   - The function `func_1` calculates the target amount by dividing the total sum by n.

   - It then iterates through the containers, keeping a running sum of (nums[i] - mean).

   - If at any point this running sum becomes negative, it returns 'NO'; otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Check Correctness:**

   - I need to verify if this logic correctly determines whether it's possible to equalize the water levels given the constraints.

   - I should consider various test cases, including edge cases, to see if the program behaves as expected.

**Step-by-Step Verification:**

1. **Base Case:**

   - n = 1: Only one container, already equal. Program should return 'YES'.

   - Input:

     ```

     1

     43

     ```

   - Output: 'YES' (as per example)

2. **Simple Case with Two Containers:**

   - n = 2, a = [1, 3]

   - Target = (1 + 3)/2 = 2

   - Can we pour from container 1 to container 2? Container 1 has 1, needs 1 more; container 2 has 3, needs to give 1. But pouring from 1 to 2 is allowed, but 1 has less than needed.

   - According to the program:

     - curr = 1 - 2 = -1 (negative, return 'NO')

     - Which matches the example output 'NO'

3. **Another Simple Case:**

   - n = 2, a = [3, 3]

   - Target = 3

   - curr = 3 - 3 = 0, then 0 + (3 - 3) = 0

   - Returns 'YES' correctly

4. **Case with Multiple Pours:**

   - n = 5, a = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]

   - Target = (4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3)/5 = 15/5 = 3

   - curr:

     - 4 - 3 = 1

     - 1 + (5 - 3) = 1 + 2 = 3

     - 3 + (2 - 3) = 3 - 1 = 2

     - 2 + (1 - 3) = 2 - 2 = 0

     - 0 + (3 - 3) = 0

   - Never negative, returns 'YES' (as per example)

5. **Case Where Pouring is Not Possible:**

   - n = 3, a = [1, 2, 3]

   - Target = (1 + 2 + 3)/3 = 2

   - curr:

     - 1 - 2 = -1 (negative, return 'NO')

   - According to the program, 'NO' (as per example)

6. **Case with Zeros:**

   - n = 4, a = [0, 0, 0, 0]

   - Target = 0

   - curr: 0, 0, 0, 0

   - Returns 'YES'

7. **Case with Large Numbers:**

   - n = 2, a = [1000000000, 1000000000]

   - Target = 1000000000

   - curr: 0, 0

   - Returns 'YES'

8. **Case Where Initial Containers Have Less Than Target:**

   - n = 3, a = [2, 2, 2]

   - Target = 2

   - curr: 2-2=0, 0+(2-2)=0, 0+(2-2)=0

   - Returns 'YES'

9. **Case Where Initial Containers Have Less and More Than Target:**

   - n = 4, a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

   - Target = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 10/4 = 2.5 (but sum is not divisible by n, but according to the problem, sum is always divisible by n)

   - Wait, sum is 10, which is divisible by 4? No, 10 % 4 = 2, which contradicts the problem statement. So, this case shouldn't occur.

10. **Another Case:**

    - n = 4, a = [3, 3, 3, 3]

    - Target = 3

    - curr: 0, 0, 0, 0

    - Returns 'YES'

11. **Edge Case with Minimal Pouring:**

    - n = 2, a = [2, 2]

    - Target = 2

    - curr: 0, 0

    - Returns 'YES'

12. **Edge Case with Maximum Pouring:**

    - n = 2, a = [0, 4]

    - Target = 2

    - curr: 0 - 2 = -2 (negative, return 'NO')

    - But intuitively, we can pour 2 from container 2 to container 1 to make both 2.

    - Wait, but the program returns 'NO' in this case because curr becomes negative.

    - Is this correct?

    - According to the problem, pouring is only allowed from lower to higher indices.

    - So, pouring from container 1 to container 2 is not allowed; only from 1 to 2, but 1 has 0 and 2 has 4.

    - Wait, but in this scenario, we cannot pour from 1 to 2 because 1 has less than needed.

    - So, is it possible to make them equal? No, because we can't pour from 2 to 1.

    - Hence, 'NO' is correct.

13. **Case with Multiple Pouring Steps:**

    - n = 3, a = [1, 2, 3]

    - Target = 2

    - curr: 1-2=-1 (negative, return 'NO')

    - Which matches the program's output

14. **Case with All Containers Having More Than Target:**

    - n = 3, a = [3, 3, 3]

    - Target = 3

    - curr: 0, 0, 0

    - Returns 'YES'

15. **Case with All Containers Having Less Than Target:**

    - n = 3, a = [1, 1, 1]

    - Target = 1

    - curr: 0, 0, 0

    - Returns 'YES'

    - Wait, but according to the program:

      - curr = 1 - 1 = 0

      - 0 + (1 - 1) = 0

      - 0 + (1 - 1) = 0

      - Returns 'YES'

    - But in this case, all are already equal to target.

16. **Case with Mixed Values:**

    - n = 4, a = [1, 3, 1, 3]

    - Target = (1+3+1+3)/4 = 8/4 = 2

    - curr:

      - 1 - 2 = -1 (negative, return 'NO')

    - Is it possible to make all equal to 2?

      - Pour from 2 to 1 and from 4 to 3.

      - But pouring is only allowed from lower to higher indices.

      - So, pouring from 2 to 1 is not allowed (2 > 1).

      - Similarly, pouring from 4 to 3 is not allowed (4 > 3).

      - Hence, it's impossible, so 'NO' is correct.

**Conclusion:**

After considering various test cases, including edge cases and cases where pouring is or isn't possible, the program seems to correctly determine whether it's possible to make all containers equal given the constraints. The logic of accumulating the difference from the target and checking if it ever goes negative makes sense because if it does, it means that at some point, there isn't enough water in the earlier containers to meet the target for that position, given the pouring constraints.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
