Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to handle a permutation of size n and find a number x using a modified binary search algorithm. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements as described.

First, I need to understand the problem description thoroughly. It says that we have a permutation p of size n, and we need to find a number x. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not because 2 appears twice, and [1,3,4] is not a permutation of n=3 because it includes 4.

The task involves performing a binary search on this permutation. However, binary search typically requires a sorted array, but here we're allowed to perform up to two swap operations on the permutation before applying the binary search to make sure that after the search, p_l equals x.

The binary search algorithm described is a bit unusual. It initializes l = 1 and r = n + 1, which is different from the standard binary search where r would be n. The loop continues until r - l = 1, and in each iteration, it calculates m = floor((r + l)/2). If p_m <= x, it sets l = m; otherwise, r = m.

The goal is to rearrange the permutation by swapping elements at most twice so that after performing this binary search, p_l equals x.

The program provided is written in Python and processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads n and x, followed by the permutation array p. It then tries to find the position of x in the array and performs the binary search as described. Based on the result, it outputs the number of swaps (0 or 1) and the swap operations if needed.

Looking at the program:

- It reads the number of test cases.

- For each test case, it reads n and x.

- Reads the permutation array p.

- Finds the position (pos) of x in the array.

- Initializes low = 0 and high = n.

- Performs the binary search loop until low + 1 < high.

- In each iteration, calculates mid = (low + high) // 2.

- If p[mid] > x, sets high = mid; else, sets low = mid.

- After the loop, checks if p[low] == x. If yes, prints 0 (no swaps needed). Else, prints 1 and the positions to swap (low + 1 and pos + 1).

Now, I need to verify if this program correctly achieves the goal as per the problem description.

First, I need to ensure that the program correctly identifies when no swaps are needed, i.e., when the binary search would already find x without any swaps.

Second, when swaps are needed, the program should perform at most two swaps to ensure that the binary search finds x.

Looking at the program, it seems that it attempts to perform at most one swap, not two as allowed. The output shows either 0 swaps or 1 swap. But the problem allows up to 2 swaps. Does this mean that the program is incorrect because it doesn't use the full allowance of swaps?

Wait, the problem says "perform no more than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j \le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j ." So, the program is allowed to perform 0, 1, or 2 swaps, as long as it makes the binary search find x.

In the program, it either performs 0 swaps or 1 swap, depending on whether the binary search finds x or not. So, it's using at most 1 swap, which is within the allowed limit.

Now, I need to check if using only one swap is sufficient to make the binary search find x in all cases. The problem states that 2 operations are always sufficient, but it doesn't specify if one operation is always sufficient.

Looking at the program, it seems to assume that one swap is enough. But is that always the case?

Let me think of an example where one swap is not enough.

Suppose n=3, x=2, and the permutation is [3,1,2].

Let's see what the binary search does:

Initialize l=0, r=3.

First loop:

mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1

p[1] = 1 <= 2, so l = 1

Now, l=1, r=3

Check if l + 1 < r: 1 + 1 = 2 < 3, so continue

Second loop:

mid = (1 + 3) // 2 = 2

p[2] = 2 <= 2, so l = 2

Now, l=2, r=3

Check if l + 1 < r: 2 + 1 = 3 < 3 is False, so exit loop

Check p[2] == 2, which is True, so no swaps needed.

Another example: n=3, x=1, permutation=[2,3,1]

Initialize l=0, r=3

First loop:

mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1

p[1] = 3 > 1, so r = 1

Now, l=0, r=1

Check if l + 1 < r: 0 + 1 = 1 < 1 is False, so exit loop

Check p[0] == 1, which is False (p[0]=2)

So, program would perform one swap: swap positions low=0 and pos=2

After swap: permutation becomes [1,3,2]

Now, rerun binary search:

l=0, r=3

First loop:

mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1

p[1]=3 > 1, so r=1

Check l + 1 < r: 0 + 1 = 1 < 1 is False, exit loop

Check p[0]==1, which is True.

So, one swap was enough in this case.

Another example: n=4, x=3, permutation=[1,2,4,3]

Binary search:

l=0, r=4

First loop:

mid=(0+4)//2=2

p[2]=4 > 3, so r=2

l=0, r=2

Check l + 1 < r: 0 + 1 = 1 < 2 is True

Second loop:

mid=(0+2)//2=1

p[1]=2 <=3, so l=1

l=1, r=2

Check l + 1 < r: 1 + 1 = 2 < 2 is False, exit loop

Check p[1]==3, which is False (p[1]=2)

Program would perform one swap: swap low=1 and pos=3

After swap: [1,3,4,2]

Rerun binary search:

l=0, r=4

First loop:

mid=2

p[2]=4 >3, so r=2

l=0, r=2

Check l + 1 < r: 0 + 1 =1 <2 is True

Second loop:

mid=(0+2)//2=1

p[1]=3 <=3, so l=1

l=1, r=2

Check l + 1 < r:1 +1=2 <2 is False, exit loop

Check p[1]==3, which is True.

Again, one swap was enough.

Is there any case where one swap is not enough?

Let me try n=4, x=2, permutation=[4,1,3,2]

Binary search:

l=0, r=4

First loop:

mid=2

p[2]=3 >2, so r=2

l=0, r=2

Check l +1 < r:0 +1=1 <2 is True

Second loop:

mid=(0+2)//2=1

p[1]=1 <=2, so l=1

l=1, r=2

Check l +1 < r:1 +1=2 <2 is False, exit loop

Check p[1]==2, which is False (p[1]=1)

Program would perform one swap: swap low=1 and pos=3

After swap: [4,2,3,1]

Rerun binary search:

l=0, r=4

First loop:

mid=2

p[2]=3 >2, so r=2

l=0, r=2

Check l +1 < r:0 +1=1 <2 is True

Second loop:

mid=(0+2)//2=1

p[1]=2 <=2, so l=1

l=1, r=2

Check l +1 < r:1 +1=2 <2 is False, exit loop

Check p[1]==2, which is True.

Again, one swap was enough.

Another example: n=5, x=3, permutation=[5,1,2,4,3]

Binary search:

l=0, r=5

First loop:

mid=2

p[2]=2 <=3, so l=2

l=2, r=5

Check l +1 < r:2 +1=3 <5 is True

Second loop:

mid=(2+5)//2=3

p[3]=4 >3, so r=3

l=2, r=3

Check l +1 < r:2 +1=3 <3 is False, exit loop

Check p[2]==3, which is False (p[2]=2)

Program would perform one swap: swap low=2 and pos=4

After swap: [5,1,3,4,2]

Rerun binary search:

l=0, r=5

First loop:

mid=2

p[2]=3 <=3, so l=2

l=2, r=5

Check l +1 < r:2 +1=3 <5 is True

Second loop:

mid=(2+5)//2=3

p[3]=4 >3, so r=3

l=2, r=3

Check l +1 < r:2 +1=3 <3 is False, exit loop

Check p[2]==3, which is True.

Again, one swap was enough.

Is there any case where one swap is not enough?

Check l +1 < r:2 +1=3 <4 is True

Second loop:

p[3]=3 <=3, so l=3

l=3, r=4

Check l +1 < r:3 +1=4 <4 is False, exit loop

Check p[3]==3, which is True.

No swaps needed.

Another case: n=5, x=2, permutation=[3,5,1,4,2]

Binary search:

l=0, r=5

First loop:

mid=2

p[2]=1 <=2, so l=2

l=2, r=5

Check l +1 < r:2 +1=3 <5 is True

Second loop:

mid=(2+5)//2=3

p[3]=4 >2, so r=3

l=2, r=3

Check l +1 < r:2 +1=3 <3 is False, exit loop

Check p[2]==2, which is False (p[2]=1)

Program would perform one swap: swap low=2 and pos=4

After swap: [3,5,2,4,1]

Rerun binary search:

l=0, r=5

First loop:

mid=2

p[2]=2 <=2, so l=2

l=2, r=5

p[3]=4 >2, so r=3

l=2, r=3

Check l +1 < r:2 +1=3 <3 is False, exit loop

Check p[2]==2, which is True.

Again, one swap was enough.

l=0, r=6

First loop:

mid=3

p[3]=4 >3, so r=3

Check l +1 < r:1 +1=2 <2 is False, exit loop

Check p[1]==4, which is False (p[1]=1)

Hmm, in this case, after one swap, the binary search still doesn't find x=4.

Original permutation: [2,1,3,6,5,4]

After swap: [2,1,5,6,3,4]

Binary search:

l=0, r=6

First loop:

mid=3

p[3]=6 >4, r=3

l=0, r=3

Second loop:

mid=1

p[1]=1 <=4, l=1

l=1, r=3

Third loop:

mid=2

p[2]=5 >4, r=2

l=1, r=2

Check p[1]==4, which is False.

So, in this case, one swap was not enough to make the binary search find x=4.

But according to the program, it would perform only one swap and expect it to work, which in this case, it doesn't.

Therefore, this is a case where the program's approach of performing at most one swap is not sufficient to make the binary search find x.

Hence, the program is incorrect because there exists at least one input for which it does not produce the correct output.

To make it correct, the program should allow for up to two swaps, not just one.

In this example, if we perform a second swap, we might be able to make the binary search find x=4.

For instance, after the first swap, we have [2,1,5,6,3,4]

We can perform a second swap: swap positions 1 and 4 to get [2,3,5,6,1,4]

Rerun binary search:

l=0, r=6

First loop:

mid=3

p[3]=6 >4, r=3

l=0, r=3

Second loop:

mid=1

p[1]=3 <=4, l=1

l=1, r=3

Third loop:

mid=2

p[2]=5 >4, r=2

l=1, r=2

Check p[1]==4, which is False (p[1]=3)

Still not correct.

Another attempt: swap positions 2 and 5 after the first swap.

After first swap: [2,1,5,6,3,4]

Swap positions 2 and 5: [2,1,4,6,3,5]

Rerun binary search:

l=0, r=6

First loop:

mid=3

p[3]=6 >4, r=3

l=0, r=3

Second loop:

mid=1

p[1]=1 <=4, l=1

l=1, r=3

Third loop:

mid=2

p[2]=4 <=4, l=2

l=2, r=3

Check p[2]==4, which is True.

So, with two swaps, we can make the binary search find x=4.

But the program only performs one swap in this case, which is not enough.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to ensure that a modified binary search correctly identifies the position of a given number \( x \) in a permutation of size \( n \), possibly by performing up to two swaps on the permutation.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a permutation \( p \) of size \( n \) and a number \( x \) to find.
   - We can perform up to two swaps on the permutation to make a modified binary search find \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Modification**:
   - The binary search is modified with \( l = 0 \) and \( r = n \).
   - The search updates \( l \) and \( r \) based on comparisons with \( p[m] \) and \( x \).
   - The goal is to have \( p[l] = x \) after the search.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Identify the position where the binary search stops.
   - If \( p[l] = x \), no swaps are needed.
   - If not, try to swap elements to make \( p[l] = x \). If one swap is not sufficient, consider two swaps.

### Solution Code

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n)
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Perform one swap
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read \( n \), \( x \), and the permutation array \( p \).

2. **Finding Position**:
   - Locate the position of \( x \) in the permutation.

3. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   - Perform the modified binary search to find the position where the search ends.

4. **Checking and Swapping**:
   - If the element at the final position \( l \) is \( x \), no swaps are needed.
   - If not, perform one swap between positions \( l \) and the position of \( x \).

5. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the number of swaps (0 or 1) and the swap operations if needed.

This approach ensures that the binary search finds \( x \) with at most one swap, which may not cover all edge cases as identified in the analysis. To handle all cases correctly, the program should be modified to allow for up to two swaps.
