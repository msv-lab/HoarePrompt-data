Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to handle a game with n possible outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i. The goal is to distribute coins for bets on these outcomes such that, no matter which outcome wins, the total coins received back are strictly more than the total coins bet.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. There are n outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i (where k_i is at least 2). For each outcome, if it wins, I get back my bet multiplied by k_i. I need to distribute bets (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) such that for every i, the sum of all bets is less than k_i * x_i.

Mathematically, for each i:

Sum of all x_j < k_i * x_i, where j ranges from 1 to n.

This needs to hold for all i from 1 to n.

Also, bets must be integers between 1 and 10^9.

If no such distribution exists, I should output -1.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to follow a specific approach. Let's see what it's doing.

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it calls func_1().

In func_1():

- It reads N, the number of outcomes.

- It reads the list of multipliers, vals.

- It calculates the product of all multipliers and stores it in prod.

- It then computes vprod, which is a list where each element is prod divided by the corresponding multiplier (i.e., prod // r for each r in vals).

- It calculates den as prod minus the sum of vprod.

- If den is less than or equal to zero, it prints -1.

- Otherwise, it prints the vprod list.

So, it's computing vprod as prod // r for each r in vals, where prod is the product of all r in vals.

I need to verify if this approach ensures that the sum of all x_j is less than k_i * x_i for every i.

Let me denote:

x_i = prod // k_i for each i.

Sum of all x_j = sum(prod // k_j for all j).

For each i, we need:

sum(prod // k_j for all j) < k_i * (prod // k_i)

Let me see if this holds.

First, note that prod = k1 * k2 * ... * kn.

So, prod // k_i = prod / k_i (since k_i divides prod).

Similarly, prod // k_j = prod / k_j.

So, sum_j (prod / k_j) < k_i * (prod / k_i)

Simplify the right side:

k_i * (prod / k_i) = prod

So, the inequality becomes:

sum_j (prod / k_j) < prod

Divide both sides by prod:

sum_j (1 / k_j) < 1

So, the condition reduces to:

sum_j (1 / k_j) < 1

If this is true, then the approach works.

But wait, in the code, it checks if den = prod - sum(vprod) > 0.

Given that vprod[j] = prod // k_j, and prod is integer, and k_j are integers >=2,

sum(vprod) = sum(prod // k_j for all j)

den = prod - sum(vprod)

From above, sum(vprod) = sum(prod / k_j) since k_j divides prod.

So, den = prod - sum(prod / k_j) = prod * (1 - sum(1/k_j))

So, den > 0 implies that 1 - sum(1/k_j) > 0, which is sum(1/k_j) < 1.

Therefore, the code is checking if sum(1/k_j) < 1, and if so, it outputs the bets as prod // k_j for each j.

This seems correct based on the earlier derivation.

But I need to make sure that this is always the case.

Wait, but in the problem, k_i can be up to 20, and n up to 50, but in reality, for some k_i, sum(1/k_j) might be >=1, in which case, no solution exists, and the code correctly outputs -1.

So, the code is checking if sum(1/k_j) < 1, and if so, providing a solution where x_i = prod // k_i.

I need to verify if this x_i satisfies the condition for all i.

Wait, but prod // k_i might not be exactly prod / k_i if there's a remainder, but since k_i divides prod, prod // k_i should be equal to prod / k_i.

Wait, no, if prod is divisible by k_i, which it is because prod is the product of all k_j, and k_i is one of them.

So, prod is divisible by k_i, hence prod // k_i == prod / k_i.

Therefore, vprod[j] = prod // k_j = prod / k_j.

So, sum(vprod) = sum(prod / k_j for all j)

And den = prod - sum(vprod) = prod - sum(prod / k_j) = prod * (1 - sum(1/k_j))

If den > 0, which is equivalent to sum(1/k_j) < 1, then the solution is valid.

Hence, the code seems correct.

But let's check with the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

6

3

3 2 7

2

3 3

5

5 5 5 5 5

6

7 9 3 17 9 13

3

6 3 2

5

9 4 6 8 3

Sample Output:

27 41 12

1 1

-1

1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071

-1

8 18 12 9 24

Let's verify the first test case:

n=3, k=[3,2,7]

Compute prod = 3*2*7 = 42

vprod = [42//3, 42//2, 42//7] = [14,21,6]

sum(vprod) = 14+21+6=41

den = 42 - 41 =1 >0, so output [14,21,6]

But in the sample output, it's 27 41 12.

Hmm, different numbers, but both are valid solutions.

Because for the first outcome:

3*27=81 > 27+41+12=80

For the second:

2*41=82 >80

For the third:

7*12=84 >80

Similarly, for my calculation:

3*14=42 >14+21+6=41

2*21=42 >41

7*6=42 >41

So both are valid.

Hence, multiple solutions exist.

Second test case:

n=2, k=[3,3]

prod=9

vprod=[9//3,9//3]=[3,3]

sum=6

den=9-6=3>0, so output [3,3]

But sample output is [1,1]

Let's check:

3*1=3 >1+1=2 (yes)

3*1=3 >2

So both [3,3] and [1,1] are valid.

Third test case:

n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5]

prod=5^5=3125

vprod=[3125//5]*5=[625,625,625,625,625]

sum=3125

den=3125-3125=0 <=0, so output -1

Which matches the sample output.

Fourth test case:

n=6, k=[7,9,3,17,9,13]

prod=7*9*3*17*9*13= unknown, but let's compute sum(1/k_i):

1/7 +1/9 +1/3 +1/17 +1/9 +1/13

Compute sum:

1/7 ≈0.142857

1/9≈0.111111

1/3≈0.333333

1/17≈0.058824

1/9≈0.111111

1/13≈0.076923

Sum≈0.142857+0.111111+0.333333+0.058824+0.111111+0.076923≈0.834169 <1

So den >0, solution exists.

Sample output:1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071

Let's verify:

sum=1989+1547+4641+819+1547+1071=11614

Check for each k_i:

7*1989=13923 >11614

9*1547=13923 >11614

3*4641=13923 >11614

17*819=13923 >11614

9*1547=13923 >11614

13*1071=13923 >11614

So it's valid.

Fifth test case:

n=3, k=[6,3,2]

prod=6*3*2=36

vprod=[36//6,36//3,36//2]=[6,12,18]

sum=6+12+18=36

den=36-36=0 <=0, so output -1

Which matches the sample.

Last test case:

n=5, k=[9,4,6,8,3]

prod=9*4*6*8*3=5184

vprod=[5184//9,5184//4,5184//6,5184//8,5184//3]=[576,1296,864,648,1728]

sum=576+1296+864+648+1728=5112

den=5184-5112=72>0, so solution exists.

Sample output:8 18 12 9 24

sum=8+18+12+9+24=61

Check:

9*8=72>61

4*18=72>61

6*12=72>61

8*9=72>61

3*24=72>61

So it's valid.

Now, I need to check if the code's approach is always correct.

From earlier reasoning, if sum(1/k_j) <1, then the solution exists and the code provides one.

But is there a case where sum(1/k_j) <1, but the code's solution doesn't work?

Wait, the code uses prod // k_i for x_i.

But prod is the product of all k_j, which is divisible by each k_i, so prod // k_i is exact.

Hence, x_i = prod // k_i.

Then, sum(x_j) = sum(prod // k_j for all j)

We need sum(x_j) < k_i * x_i for each i.

Which simplifies to sum(prod // k_j for all j) < prod

Which is equivalent to sum(1/k_j) <1, which is already checked.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Is there any edge case where this might fail?

Let me think about k_i=2, the smallest possible.

If all k_i=2, and n=1, then sum(1/k_j)=1/2 <1, so solution exists.

x_1=prod//2=2//2=1

sum(x_j)=1 <2*1=2, which holds.

If n=2, k=[2,2], prod=4

x_1=4//2=2

x_2=4//2=2

sum=4

But 2*2=4, which is not strictly greater than sum.

Wait, but in this case, sum(1/k_j)=1/2 +1/2=1, which is not less than 1.

Hence, sum(1/k_j)=1, which should lead to den=prod - sum(vprod)=4 - (2+2)=0 <=0, so output -1, which is correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, sum(1/k_j)<1 is required for a solution to exist.

Hence, in this case, sum(1/k_j)=1, which is not less than 1, so no solution exists, correctly output -1.

Another case: n=1, k=[2]

prod=2

vprod=[2//2]=1

sum=1

den=2-1=1>0, so output [1]

Check: 2*1=2 >1, which holds.

Another case: n=1, k=[3]

prod=3

vprod=[3//3]=1

sum=1

den=3-1=2>0, output [1]

Check: 3*1=3>1, holds.

Another case: n=4, k=[2,2,2,2]

prod=16

vprod=[16//2,16//2,16//2,16//2]=[8,8,8,8]

sum=32

den=16-32=-16 <=0, output -1

Which is correct, since sum(1/k_j)=1/2+1/2+1/2+1/2=2 >=1, so no solution exists.

Seems consistent.

Another case: n=3, k=[2,3,6]

prod=2*3*6=36

vprod=[36//2,36//3,36//6]=[18,12,6]

sum=18+12+6=36

den=36-36=0 <=0, output -1

But sum(1/k_j)=1/2+1/3+1/6=1, which is not less than 1, so correctly output -1.

Another case: n=3, k=[2,3,7]

prod=2*3*7=42

vprod=[42//2,42//3,42//7]=[21,14,6]

sum=21+14+6=41

den=42-41=1>0, output [21,14,6]

Check:

2*21=42>41

3*14=42>41

7*6=42>41

Holds.

Another case: n=2, k=[3,4]

prod=12

vprod=[12//3,12//4]=[4,3]

sum=7

den=12-7=5>0, output [4,3]

Check:

3*4=12>7

4*3=12>7

Holds.

Seems correct.

Is there a case where sum(1/k_j)<1, but the code's solution doesn't work?

I can't think of one, as the mathematics seems sound.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
