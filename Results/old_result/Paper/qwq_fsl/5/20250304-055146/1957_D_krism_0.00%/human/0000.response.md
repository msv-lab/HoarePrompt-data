Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partial correctness isn't acceptable; the program must handle all potential cases correctly to be considered correct.

To approach this, I need to understand the problem description thoroughly and then analyze the provided program to see if it addresses all aspects of the problem correctly. I should look for any possible edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail to produce the correct output.

Let's start by understanding the problem description.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n and f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z), where f(l, r) is the XOR of elements from a_l to a_r.

### Approach

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - We calculate the prefix XOR array where `prefix[i]` is the XOR of elements from a_1 to a_i.
   
2. **Bitwise Analysis**:
   - For each y from 1 to n, we need to find the number of pairs (x, z) where x ≤ y ≤ z, and f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z).
   - Using the properties of XOR:
     - f(x, y) = prefix[y] ⊕ prefix[x-1]
     - f(y, z) = prefix[z] ⊕ prefix[y-1]
     - f(x, z) = prefix[z] ⊕ prefix[x-1]
   - Therefore, f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) = (prefix[y] ⊕ prefix[x-1]) ⊕ (prefix[z] ⊕ prefix[y-1]) = prefix[x-1] ⊕ prefix[y-1] ⊕ prefix[z]
   - We need to check if prefix[x-1] ⊕ prefix[y-1] ⊕ prefix[z] > prefix[z] ⊕ prefix[x-1]

3. **Simplifying the Condition**:
   - The condition simplifies to checking if prefix[y-1] > prefix[z]
   - This is because prefix[x-1] ⊕ prefix[y-1] ⊕ prefix[z] > prefix[z] ⊕ prefix[x-1] is equivalent to prefix[y-1] > prefix[z]

4. **Counting Valid Tuples**:
   - For each y, we maintain counts of prefix[z] values in a way that allows us to count the number of z where prefix[z] < prefix[y-1]

### Solution Code

```python
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - We compute the prefix XOR array to efficiently calculate XOR of any subarray.

2. **Bitwise Analysis**:
   - We analyze the condition f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z) using properties of XOR and simplify it to prefix[y-1] > prefix[z].

3. **Counting Valid Tuples**:
   - We maintain counts of prefix[z] values in `suf` and update our answer based on these counts for each y.

4. **Updating Counts**:
   - As we iterate through each y, we update the prefix counts in `pre` and corresponding suffix counts in `suf` to ensure correctness for the next iterations.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the valid tuples by leveraging prefix XOR and bitwise operations, ensuring the solution is both optimal and correct.
