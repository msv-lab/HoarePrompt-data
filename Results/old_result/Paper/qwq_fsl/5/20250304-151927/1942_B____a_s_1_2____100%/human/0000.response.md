Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to reconstruct a permutation p based on an array a, where each a_i is defined as the MEX of the prefix p_1 to p_i minus p_i. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in that array.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. We're given:

- A permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1.

- An array a of length n, where a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i.

The task is to reconstruct p given a, and the problem guarantees that at least one valid p exists for the given a.

Looking at the program:

```python

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        p = [-1] * n

        mex = n

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

            p[i] = mex - a[i]

            mex = min(mex, p[i])

        print(*p)

```

I need to determine if this program correctly reconstructs p for any valid input a, given the constraints.

Let me break down the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases t.

2. For each test case:

- Reads n, the length of the arrays.

- Reads the array a.

- Initializes an array p of size n with -1.

- Sets mex to n.

- Iterates from the last element to the first in a:

- Sets p[i] to mex - a[i].

- Updates mex to be the minimum of the current mex and p[i].

- Prints the constructed p.

I need to verify if this logic correctly computes p such that for each i, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

Let's think about how MEX works and how to compute p.

Given that p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, and a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

I need to find p such that this condition holds.

First, MEX(p_1 to p_i) is the smallest non-negative integer not in the prefix p_1 to p_i.

Given that p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, the MEX of any prefix will be a number between 0 and n, inclusive.

Wait, since p contains numbers from 0 to n-1, the MEX of any prefix can be from 0 to n.

But actually, since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, the MEX of the entire array p is n, because all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present.

For any prefix, if it contains all numbers from 0 to some k-1 and misses k, then MEX is k.

But more generally, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix.

Given that, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

We need to find p_i such that p_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - a_i.

Wait, looking back at the code, it sets p[i] = mex - a[i], and then updates mex to be the minimum of the current mex and p[i].

I need to understand how this works.

Let me consider the last element.

For i = n-1, a[n-1] = MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1}) - p_{n-1}.

Let me denote MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1}) as mex_{n-1}.

Then a_{n-1} = mex_{n-1} - p_{n-1}.

So p_{n-1} = mex_{n-1} - a_{n-1}.

Similarly, for i = n-2, a_{n-2} = MEX(p_1 to p_{n-2}) - p_{n-2}.

Denote MEX(p_1 to p_{n-2}) as mex_{n-2}.

Then p_{n-2} = mex_{n-2} - a_{n-2}.

And so on.

The code initializes mex to n and iterates from the last element to the first, setting p[i] = mex - a[i], and then updating mex to be the minimum of mex and p[i].

I need to see if this correctly computes p.

Let me consider the example provided:

Input:

3

5

1 1 -2 1 2

5

1 1 1 1 1

3

-2 1 2

Output:

0 1 4 2 3

0 1 2 3 4

2 0 1

Let's verify the first test case:

n = 5

a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]

p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]

Check a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i for each i:

i=0: p_1 = 0 → MEX(0) = 1 → a_0 = 1 - 0 = 1

i=1: p_1 to p_2 = [0,1] → MEX(0,1) = 2 → a_1 = 2 - 1 = 1

i=2: p_1 to p_3 = [0,1,4] → MEX(0,1,4) = 2 → a_2 = 2 - 4 = -2

i=3: p_1 to p_4 = [0,1,4,2] → MEX(0,1,4,2) = 3 → a_3 = 3 - 2 = 1

i=4: p_1 to p_5 = [0,1,4,2,3] → MEX(0,1,4,2,3) = 5 → a_4 = 5 - 3 = 2

Which matches the given a = [1,1,-2,1,2]

Similarly, for the second test case:

n=5

a=[1,1,1,1,1]

p=[0,1,2,3,4]

Check:

i=0: MEX(0)=1 → a_0=1-0=1

i=1: MEX(0,1)=2 → a_1=2-1=1

i=2: MEX(0,1,2)=3 → a_2=3-2=1

i=3: MEX(0,1,2,3)=4 → a_3=4-3=1

i=4: MEX(0,1,2,3,4)=5 → a_4=5-4=1

Which matches a=[1,1,1,1,1]

Third test case:

n=3

a=[-2,1,2]

p=[2,0,1]

Check:

i=0: MEX(2)=0 → a_0=0-2=-2

i=1: MEX(2,0)=1 → a_1=1-0=1

i=2: MEX(2,0,1)=3 → a_2=3-1=2

Which matches a=[-2,1,2]

So, the program seems to work for these examples.

Now, I need to think if there are any edge cases where this might fail.

Let me consider n=1:

If n=1, a=[x], and p=[y], where y is 0 (since it's a permutation of 0).

Then a_0 = MEX(p_0) - p_0 = MEX(y) - y.

If y=0, then MEX(0)=1 → a_0=1-0=1.

So, for n=1, a must be [1], and p must be [0].

Let's see what the program does for n=1, a=[1]:

p[0] = mex - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0

Then mex = min(1, 0) = 0

So p=[0], which is correct.

Another case: n=2

Possible p=[0,1], a=[1,1]

Because:

a_0= MEX(0)=1 -0=1

a_1= MEX(0,1)=2 -1=1

Another p=[1,0], a=[0,-1]

Because:

a_0= MEX(1)=0 -1=-1

a_1= MEX(1,0)=2 -0=2

Wait, but according to the problem, a_i = MEX(prefix) - p_i

For p=[1,0]

a_0= MEX(1)=0 -1=-1

a_1= MEX(1,0)=2 -0=2

So a=[-1,2]

Let's see if the program can handle this.

Input:

2

-1 2

According to the program:

Initialize p=[-1,-1], mex=2

i=1: p[1]=2 - 2=0, mex=min(2,0)=0

i=0: p[0]=0 - (-1)=1

So p=[1,0], which is correct.

Another edge case: n=1, a=[1], p=[0] as above.

What if n=2, a=[1,1], p=[0,1]

As above, correct.

What if n=3, a=[1,1,1], p=[0,1,2]

As in the example, correct.

What if n=3, a=[0,-1,2], p=[1,0,2]

Check:

a_0= MEX(1)=0 -1=-1 → Wait, MEX(1)=0, a_0=0-1=-1

a_1= MEX(1,0)=2 -0=2

a_2= MEX(1,0,2)=3 -2=1

Wait, but a=[-1,2,1], but I thought a=[0,-1,2], so maybe p is different.

Wait, perhaps p=[2,1,0]

Check:

a_0= MEX(2)=0 -2=-2

a_1= MEX(2,1)=0 -1=-1

a_2= MEX(2,1,0)=3 -0=3

So a=[-2,-1,3], which is different.

Wait, the problem says that for the given a, there exists at least one p, and we need to find any one of them.

So, for a given a, there might be multiple p or only one p that satisfies the condition.

The program needs to find at least one such p.

Given that, I need to check if the program always finds a valid p for any valid a.

Looking back at the program:

It initializes mex to n.

Then iterates from i=n-1 to 0:

p[i] = mex - a[i]

mex = min(mex, p[i])

Then prints p.

I need to see if this p satisfies the condition a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i for all i.

Let me try to understand why this works.

First, consider that MEX(p_1 to p_i) is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_i.

Given that p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, MEX(p_1 to p_i) can be from 0 to n.

But in the problem, a_i can be from -n to n, and p_i is from 0 to n-1.

Given a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i, we can rearrange to MEX(p_1 to p_i) = a_i + p_i.

So, MEX(p_1 to p_i) = a_i + p_i.

But MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_i.

So, a_i + p_i must be such that it's the smallest missing number in p_1 to p_i.

The program sets p[i] = mex - a[i], and then updates mex to be the minimum of mex and p[i].

Wait, let's see.

At each step, it's trying to determine p[i] based on the current mex and a[i].

But how does it compute mex?

In the program, mex is initialized to n, and then updated to be the minimum of itself and p[i] for each i from n-1 to 0.

I need to see if this correctly maintains the MEX for each prefix.

Let me consider the algorithm in more detail.

Starting from the end:

For i = n-1:

p[n-1] = mex - a[n-1]

Then mex = min(mex, p[n-1])

Similarly for i = n-2:

p[n-2] = mex - a[n-2]

mex = min(mex, p[n-2])

And so on, up to i=0.

I need to see if, after constructing p in this way, for each prefix p_1 to p_i, MEX(p_1 to p_i) = a_i + p_i.

Let me try to think about what mex represents in this context.

Initially, mex is set to n, which is the MEX of the entire array p, since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1.

Then, for each i from n-1 to 0:

p[i] = mex - a[i]

Then, mex = min(mex, p[i])

Wait, this seems a bit counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that, for each i, MEX(p_1 to p_i) = a_i + p_i.

So, for the entire array, MEX(p_1 to p_n) = a_n + p_n.

But p_n is just one element, and MEX(p_1 to p_n) should be n, since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1.

But a_n = MEX(p_1 to p_n) - p_n = n - p_n.

So, p_n = n - a_n.

Wait, but in the code, it sets p[n-1] = mex - a[n-1], and mex is initially n.

So, p[n-1] = n - a[n-1].

Which matches p_n = n - a_n.

Wait, but in the first example:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3

Then mex = min(5,3)=3

p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2, mex = min(3,2)=2

p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4, mex = min(2,4)=2

p[1] = 2 - 1 =1, mex = min(2,1)=1

p[0] =1 -1=0, mex = min(1,0)=0

So p=[0,1,4,2,3], which matches the first example.

Similarly, in the second example:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

p[4]=5-1=4, mex=min(5,4)=4

p[3]=4-1=3, mex=min(4,3)=3

p[2]=3-1=2, mex=min(3,2)=2

p[1]=2-1=1, mex=min(2,1)=1

p[0]=1-1=0

So p=[0,1,2,3,4], which matches the second example.

Third example:

n=3, a=[-2,1,2]

p[2]=3-2=1, mex=min(3,1)=1

p[1]=1-1=0, mex=min(1,0)=0

p[0]=0 - (-2) = 2

So p=[2,0,1], which matches the third example.

So, it seems to work for these cases.

But is this general?

Let me try to think of another test case.

Suppose n=4, a=[1,1,1,1]

Then, p[3]=4-1=3, mex=min(4,3)=3

p[2]=3-1=2, mex=min(3,2)=2

p[1]=2-1=1, mex=min(2,1)=1

p[0]=1-1=0

So p=[0,1,2,3]

Check:

a_0= MEX(0)=1 -0=1

a_1= MEX(0,1)=2 -1=1

a_2= MEX(0,1,2)=3 -2=1

a_3= MEX(0,1,2,3)=4 -3=1

Which matches a=[1,1,1,1]

Another test case: n=4, a=[0,-1,-2,-3]

Compute p[3]=4 - (-3)=7, but p_i should be between 0 and 3, so p[3]=7 is invalid.

Wait, but the problem states that p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, so p_i should be between 0 and n-1.

But in this case, p[3]=7, which is invalid.

Wait, but the problem says that for the given a, there exists at least one valid p.

So, perhaps such an a does not exist for n=4, or maybe it does, but p_i cannot be 7.

Wait, for n=4, p_i can only be 0,1,2,3.

So, if p[3]=7, it's invalid.

But according to the program, p[3]=4 - (-3)=7, which is invalid.

However, the problem says that the input is given in such a way that at least one valid p exists.

So, perhaps for a=[0,-1,-2,-3], no valid p exists, but the problem guarantees that at least one valid p exists for the given a.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, if p=[3,2,1,0], let's check:

a_0= MEX(3)=0 -3=-3

a_1= MEX(3,2)=0 -2=-2

a_2= MEX(3,2,1)=0 -1=-1

a_3= MEX(3,2,1,0)=4 -0=4

But given a=[0,-1,-2,-3], which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps p=[2,1,0,3]

Check:

a_0= MEX(2)=0 -2=-2

a_1= MEX(2,1)=0 -1=-1

a_2= MEX(2,1,0)=3 -0=3

a_3= MEX(2,1,0,3)=4 -3=1

Which is a=[-2,-1,3,1], not matching a=[0,-1,-2,-3]

Another p: [1,0,3,2]

a_0= MEX(1)=0 -1=-1

a_1= MEX(1,0)=2 -0=2

a_2= MEX(1,0,3)=2 -3=-1

a_3= MEX(1,0,3,2)=4 -2=2

Which is a=[-1,2,-1,2], not matching.

Another p: [3,0,1,2]

a_0= MEX(3)=0 -3=-3

a_1= MEX(3,0)=1 -0=1

a_2= MEX(3,0,1)=2 -1=1

a_3= MEX(3,0,1,2)=4 -2=2

Which is a=[-3,1,1,2], not matching.

Seems like for a=[0,-1,-2,-3], there might not be a valid p, but the problem says that for the given input, there is at least one valid p.

So, perhaps such an a is invalid, and hence, the program might not handle it, but since the problem guarantees that at least one valid p exists, I don't need to worry about invalid a's.

But in the case where p[i] exceeds n-1 or is negative, which is invalid, but the problem says p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, so p[i] should be between 0 and n-1.

In the program, p[i] = mex - a[i], and mex starts from n and is updated to be the minimum of itself and p[i].

Wait, in the earlier example where p[i]=7, which is invalid, but the problem guarantees that at least one valid p exists, so perhaps for the given a, p[i] would never exceed n-1.

Wait, but in that case, p[i]=mex - a[i], and mex is initially n, which is equal to n, and a[i] can be as low as -n, so p[i]=n - (-n)=2n, which could be larger than n-1.

But the problem says that for the given a, there exists at least one valid p, so perhaps for such a, p[i] would not exceed n-1 due to the constraints on a.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is incorrect in such cases.

Wait, but in the examples provided, p[i] never exceeds n-1, as p is a permutation.

So, perhaps I need to ensure that p[i] is within 0 to n-1.

But in the program, p[i] = mex - a[i], and mex starts from n, which is n, and a[i] can be as low as -n, so p[i] can be up to 2n, which is invalid.

But the problem says that for the given a, there exists at least one valid p, so perhaps such a's are not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the program is incorrect in handling cases where p[i] exceeds n-1.

But according to the problem, for the given input, at least one valid p exists, so perhaps the program adjusts accordingly.

Wait, in the code, p[i] = mex - a[i], and then mex is updated to be the minimum of mex and p[i].

But, in the earlier example where p[i]=7, which is invalid, but perhaps in valid cases, p[i] doesn't exceed n-1.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that p is a permutation, so all p[i] are distinct and between 0 and n-1.

But in the program, there's no check to ensure that p[i] are distinct or within 0 to n-1.

So, perhaps the program could produce invalid p in some cases, even if a corresponds to a valid p.

But in the examples, it seems to work.

Let me think of another test case.

Suppose n=4, a=[1,2,3,4]

Compute p[3]=4-4=0, mex=min(4,0)=0

p[2]=0-3=-3, which is invalid as p[i] should be >=0.

But according to the problem, p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, so p[i] should be between 0 and n-1.

So, p[i]=-3 is invalid.

But again, the problem says that for the given a, there exists at least one valid p.

So, perhaps such an a doesn't exist, or if it does, the program doesn't handle it correctly.

Wait, let's see.

If p=[x,y,z,w], a permutation of 0,1,2,3.

For a=[1,2,3,4], let's see if any p satisfies a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

For p=[0,1,2,3]:

a_0=1-0=1

a_1=2-1=1

a_2=3-2=1

a_3=4-3=1

Which is a=[1,1,1,1], not [1,2,3,4]

Another p: [1,0,2,3]

a_0=0-1=-1

a_1=2-0=2

a_2=3-2=1

a_3=4-3=1

Which is a=[-1,2,1,1], not [1,2,3,4]

Another p: [2,0,1,3]

a_0=0-2=-2

a_1=2-0=2

a_2=3-1=2

a_3=4-3=1

Which is a=[-2,2,2,1], not [1,2,3,4]

Another p: [3,0,1,2]

a_0=0-3=-3

a_1=2-0=2

a_2=3-1=2

a_3=4-2=2

Which is a=[-3,2,2,2], not [1,2,3,4]

Seems like no p satisfies a=[1,2,3,4], which means that for a=[1,2,3,4], no valid p exists.

But according to the problem, for the given a, there exists at least one valid p.

So, perhaps such an a is invalid, and hence, I don't need to consider it.

Therefore, assuming that for the given a, at least one valid p exists, the program seems to work for the provided examples.

I need to think if there are any other edge cases where the program might fail.

Consider n=1, a=[1], p=[0], as above, works.

n=2, a=[1,1], p=[0,1], works.

n=2, a=[0,-1], p=[1,0], works.

Another case: n=3, a=[-2,1,2], p=[2,0,1], works.

Seems consistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider cases where a_i + p_i is not the MEX.

But according to the program's logic, it sets p[i] = mex - a[i], and then updates mex to be the minimum of mex and p[i].

I need to see if this maintains the correct MEX for each prefix.

Let me consider the algorithm in terms of maintaining the correct MEX.

Initially, mex is set to n.

For each i from n-1 to 0:

p[i] = mex - a[i]

Then, mex = min(mex, p[i])

So, for each position, it's determining p[i] based on the current mex and a[i], and then updating mex.

I need to see if this ensures that for each prefix, MEX(p_1 to p_i) = a_i + p_i.

Let me consider that MEX(p_1 to p_i) is equal to a_i + p_i.

Given that, and p[i] = mex - a[i], then MEX(p_1 to p_i) = a_i + p_i = a_i + (mex - a[i]) = mex.

So, MEX(p_1 to p_i) = mex.

But mex is being updated to be the minimum of itself and p[i].

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that, for the prefix p_1 to p_i, the MEX is equal to mex at that step.

But mex is being updated to be the minimum of itself and p[i].

So, if p[i] is less than mex, then mex is updated to p[i].

But, in that case, MEX(p_1 to p_i) would be mex, and a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i = mex - p_i.

But p_i = mex - a_i, which matches the program's assignment.

So, it seems consistent.

Hence, the program's logic seems correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
