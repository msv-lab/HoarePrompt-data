Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the provided program.

### Problem Description

There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1 to n. Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i-th container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Pour any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i < j.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using this operation.

### Provided Program

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

### Analysis

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem fully.

- We have n containers with initial amounts a1, a2, ..., an.
- We can only pour water from a container with a lower index to a higher index.
- The total sum of a_i is divisible by n, so the target amount for each container is sum(a_i) / n.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all containers have this target amount using the allowed operations.

The program provided seems to follow this logic:

1. Calculate the total sum and check if it's divisible by n. If not, it should return 'NO', but since the problem states that the sum is always divisible by n, this check might be redundant.
2. Calculate the target amount (mean).
3. Iterate through the containers from left to right, accumulating the difference between the current container's amount and the target.
4. If at any point this accumulated difference (curr) becomes negative, return 'NO'. Otherwise, return 'YES'.

I need to verify if this logic correctly determines whether it's possible to equalize the water levels under the given constraints.

### Key Points to Verify

1. **Sum Divisibility**: The problem states that the sum is always divisible by n, so the check `if total % n != 0:` might be unnecessary. However, since it's given that the sum is always divisible by n, this check doesn't harm and can be considered a safety measure.

2. **Accumulated Difference Logic**: The variable `curr` accumulates the difference between the current container's water and the target amount. If `curr` ever becomes negative, it means that there isn't enough water in the previous containers to cover the deficit, given the pouring direction constraint (i < j).

3. **Correctness of the Approach**: I need to confirm if this approach correctly captures the possibility of equalizing the water levels.

### Test Cases

Let's look at the example provided in the problem description:

**Input:**

```

6

1

43

2

1 3

5

4 5 2 1 3

3

1 2 3

7

4 5 5 0 6 4 4

7

6 5 5 1 3 4 4

```

**Output:**

```

YES

NO

YES

NO

NO

YES

```

Let's see how the program handles these cases.

#### Test Case 1:

- n = 1

- a = [43]

- Sum is 43, which is divisible by 1. Target is 43.

- curr = 43 - 43 = 0

- No negative curr, so 'YES'

#### Test Case 2:

- n = 2

- a = [1, 3]

- Sum is 4, divisible by 2. Target is 2.

- curr = 1 - 2 = -1 (negative, so 'NO')

#### Test Case 3:

- n = 5

- a = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]

- Sum is 15, divisible by 5. Target is 3.

- curr changes as follows:

  - 4 - 3 = 1

  - 1 + (5 - 3) = 3

  - 3 + (2 - 3) = 2

  - 2 + (1 - 3) = 0

  - 0 + (3 - 3) = 0

- No negative curr, so 'YES'

#### Test Case 4:

- n = 3

- a = [1, 2, 3]

- Sum is 6, divisible by 3. Target is 2.

- curr changes as follows:

  - 1 - 2 = -1 (negative, so 'NO')

#### Test Case 5:

- n = 7

- a = [4, 5, 5, 0, 6, 4, 4]

- Sum is 28, divisible by 7. Target is 4.

- curr changes:

  - 4 - 4 = 0

  - 0 + (5 - 4) = 1

  - 1 + (5 - 4) = 2

  - 2 + (0 - 4) = -2 (negative, so 'NO')

#### Test Case 6:

- n = 7

- a = [6, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4]

- Sum is 28, divisible by 7. Target is 4.

- curr changes:

  - 6 - 4 = 2

  - 2 + (5 - 4) = 3

  - 3 + (5 - 4) = 4

  - 4 + (1 - 4) = 1

  - 1 + (3 - 4) = 0

  - 0 + (4 - 4) = 0

  - 0 + (4 - 4) = 0

- No negative curr, so 'YES'

These match the expected output.

### Edge Cases

I need to think about edge cases to ensure the program handles them correctly.

1. **Single Container**: Already covered in Test Case 1.

2. **All Containers Have the Same Amount**: For example, n=3, a=[2,2,2]. Should return 'YES'.

3. **Minimal Deficit**: n=2, a=[1,1], target=1. curr=0, then 0 + (1-1)=0. 'YES'

4. **Large Numbers**: n=2, a=[1000000000, 1000000000], which should return 'YES'.

5. **Zero Amounts**: n=1, a=[0], should return 'YES'.

6. **Zero in Combination**: n=3, a=[0,0,0], should return 'YES'.

7. **Negative Differences but Feasible**: Not applicable since amounts are non-negative.

8. **Maximal n**: n=2*10^5, with a_i=0 or minimal values, to check for performance, but since the function is O(n), it should be fine.

### Potential Issues

I need to think if there are any scenarios where the program might incorrectly return 'NO' when it should be 'YES', or vice versa.

- **Accumulated Difference Interpretation**: The logic seems to ensure that at no point do we have a deficit that can't be covered by future containers, given the pouring direction.

- **Rounding Errors**: Since we're dealing with integer division and the sum is guaranteed to be divisible by n, this shouldn't be an issue.

- **Overflow**: Given that a_i can be up to 10^9 and n up to 2*10^5, sum can be up to 2*10^14, which is within the range of Python's integers.

- **Pouring Direction Constraint**: The key is that we can only pour from lower to higher indices. The program seems to capture this by accumulating differences from left to right.

### Alternative Approach

An alternative way to think about this problem is to consider that we can only move water forward. So, for each position, the cumulative water up to that point should be at least the target amount times the number of positions up to that point.

In other words, for the first k containers (1 to k), the sum of their water should be at least k * target. This is similar to the prefix sum being greater than or equal to the target multiplied by the number of containers up to that point.

The program implements this by keeping a running sum of (nums[i] - mean), ensuring it never goes negative.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and considering various test cases, including edge cases, it seems that the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it's possible to equalize the water levels in all containers under the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correctness: } \textbf{True}}\]
