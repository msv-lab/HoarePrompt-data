Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, swapping them, and concatenating them back together.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. The problem is about checking if, through a series of operations where we split the array into two parts and swap their positions, we can achieve a sorted (non-decreasing) array. The operations can be performed any number of times, including zero.

Let's look at the examples provided in the problem to understand better:

1. For the array [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4], the answer is "No". This means that no matter how many times we perform the operation, we cannot sort this array in non-decreasing order.

2. For the array [7, 9, 2, 2, 3], the answer is "Yes". By performing the operations as described in the note, it's possible to sort the array.

3. For the array [1, 2, 3], which is already sorted, the answer is "Yes".

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems to consist of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case, collecting the results and printing them.

Let's focus on `func_1`, as it seems to contain the logic for determining whether the array can be sorted through the specified operations.

Here's `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'
```

Wait a minute, this seems a bit confusing. Let's break it down.

First, it checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`. If it is, it returns 'Yes', which makes sense.

If the array is not sorted, it then checks if there is any pair of elements where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`. If there is at least one such pair, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

But wait, the condition `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` is essentially checking if the array is not sorted. But if the array is not sorted, and there is at least one pair where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`, it returns 'No'. However, the else clause seems misplaced because if the array is not sorted, and there is at least one such pair, it should return 'No', and if there are no such pairs, it should return 'Yes'. But since the array is already checked to not be sorted, this else clause would only trigger if there are no pairs where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`, which should be impossible because if the array is not sorted, there must be at least one such pair.

This seems logically inconsistent. Maybe I'm misreading it.

Let me rephrase:

- If the array is already sorted, return 'Yes'.

- Else, if there is any `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`, return 'No'.

- Else, return 'Yes'.

But the else clause here doesn't make sense because if the array is not sorted (as determined by the first condition), and there is at least one `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`, return 'No'. Otherwise, return 'Yes'. But if the array is not sorted, there must be at least one `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`, so it should always return 'No' in this case.

Wait, but the problem allows performing operations to sort the array. So, just checking if the array is sorted or not doesn't suffice. We need to check if it's possible to sort it through the allowed operations.

I think there's a misunderstanding here. The function `func_1` seems to be incorrectly implemented because it doesn't consider the operations at all. It only checks if the array is sorted or not, and if it's not sorted, it returns 'No' unless there are no pairs where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`, which is contradictory.

Looking back at the examples:

- For [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4], it's "No".

- For [7, 9, 2, 2, 3], it's "Yes".

- For [1, 2, 3], it's "Yes".

If we pass [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4] to `func_1`, it's not sorted, and there are pairs where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]` (like 5 > 1), so it would return 'No', which matches the expected output.

For [7, 9, 2, 2, 3], it's not sorted, and there are pairs where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]` (7 > 2), so it would return 'No', but the expected output is "Yes". This indicates that the function is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of sorting through operations.

Similarly, for [1, 2, 3], it's sorted, so it returns 'Yes', which is correct.

So, the function fails in cases where the array is not initially sorted but can be sorted through the allowed operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it doesn't consider the operations at all. It only checks if the array is sorted or not, which is not sufficient to determine if it can be sorted through the specified operations.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find a way to determine if the array can be sorted by performing the split-and-swap operation any number of times.

One key observation is that the split-and-swap operation is similar to rotating the array. Each operation effectively rotates the array by moving a prefix to the end.

In standard rotation, we can perform left rotations or right rotations. Here, splitting into x and y and swapping them corresponds to a specific kind of rotation.

However, standard array rotations can achieve any permutation that is a rotation of the original array. But in this problem, we need to check if, through such rotations, we can reach a sorted array.

But wait, in standard array rotation, we can only reach permutations that are rotations of the original array. So, if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array, then it's possible; otherwise, it's not.

But the problem allows performing the operation any number of times. So, we need to check if the array can be sorted through any sequence of such rotations.

Wait, but in standard array rotations, any sequence of rotations can be reduced to a single rotation. So, perhaps the array can be sorted if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But let's verify this.

Take the second test case: [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]

Its sorted version is [2, 2, 3, 7, 9], which is a rotation of the original array.

Similarly, the first test case: [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]

Its sorted version is [1,1,4,4,5,1], which is not a rotation of the original array.

Wait, [1,1,4,4,5,1] is not a rotation of [1,1,4,5,1,4], because in rotations, the sequence must appear in the same order, but here, it doesn't match any rotation.

Hence, the hypothesis seems to hold: the array can be sorted if and only if its sorted version is a rotation of the original array.

But wait, in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3] can be sorted to [2,2,3,7,9], which is a rotation of the original array.

In the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4] sorted is [1,1,4,4,5,1], which isn't a rotation of the original array.

Hence, the program should check if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

But the provided `func_1` doesn't do that. It simply checks if the array is sorted or not, which is insufficient.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to sort the array and check if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

Here's how we can do it:

1. Sort the array.

2. Check if the sorted array is a rotation of the original array.

To check if one array is a rotation of another, we can concatenate the original array to itself and check if the sorted array is a substring of this concatenated array.

For example:

Original: [7,9,2,2,3]

Sorted: [2,2,3,7,9]

Concatenated original: [7,9,2,2,3,7,9,2,2,3]

Now, check if [2,2,3,7,9] is a substring of [7,9,2,2,3,7,9,2,2,3], which it is.

Similarly, for [1,1,4,5,1,4], sorted is [1,1,4,4,5,1], which is not a rotation.

Hence, this method should work.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect because it doesn't implement this logic.

Hence, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
