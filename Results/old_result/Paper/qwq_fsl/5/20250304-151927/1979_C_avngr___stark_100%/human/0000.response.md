Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets all the requirements for every possible input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, I need to understand the problem description fully. The game involves n possible outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i. I have to bet integer amounts on each outcome such that, no matter which outcome wins, the total coins I get back are more than the total coins I bet.

So, for each test case, I'm given n and a list of k_i values. I need to find n integer bets x_i such that:

Sum of all x_i < min(k_i * x_i for all i)

This means that for every possible winning outcome, the return is greater than the total bet.

The program provided takes input for multiple test cases, processes each one, and outputs either a list of bets or -1 if no such bets exist.

Looking at the program:

- It reads the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- Reads n.

- Reads the list of k_i.

- Computes m using func_2(k), which seems to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the k_i values.

- Computes c_i as m // k_i for each i.

- Checks if sum(c) >= m, and if so, prints -1; else, prints the c_i values.

I need to verify if this approach is correct and always produces the right output for any valid input.

First, I need to understand what m represents. func_2 computes the LCM of the k_i values using func_1, which calculates the LCM of two numbers.

So, m is the LCM of all k_i.

Then, c_i is m divided by k_i.

Now, the total sum of c_i is sum(m // k_i for all i).

The condition checks if sum(c_i) >= m.

If it is, it prints -1, else it prints the c_i values.

I need to verify if this logic correctly ensures that sum(x_i) < min(k_i * x_i).

Let's analyze this.

Given x_i = m // k_i,

Then k_i * x_i = k_i * (m // k_i).

Since m is divisible by k_i (because m is LCM of all k_i), m // k_i is integer, and k_i * (m // k_i) = m.

So, k_i * x_i = m for all i.

Therefore, min(k_i * x_i) = m.

Sum of x_i is sum(m // k_i for all i).

The condition checks if sum(m // k_i for all i) >= m.

If sum(m // k_i) >= m, it prints -1, else it prints the x_i values.

But according to the problem, sum(x_i) should be strictly less than min(k_i * x_i), which is m.

So, if sum(m // k_i) < m, then it's correct; else, no solution exists.

I need to confirm if this is always true.

Let me consider some examples.

Example 1 from the problem:

n=3, k=[3,2,7]

m = LCM(3,2,7) = 42

c_i = [42//3, 42//2, 42//7] = [14,21,6]

sum(c_i) = 14+21+6 = 41 < 42, which is correct.

Example 2:

n=2, k=[3,3]

m=3

c_i=[1,1]

sum(c_i)=2 < 3, which is correct.

Example 3:

n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5]

m=5

c_i=[1,1,1,1,1]

sum(c_i)=5 >= 5, so sum >= m, hence -1, which matches the output.

Another example:

n=1, k=[2]

m=2

c_i=[1]

sum(c_i)=1 < 2, which is correct.

Another case:

n=4, k=[2,4,6,3]

m=LCM(2,4,6,3)=12

c_i=[12//2,12//4,12//6,12//3]=[6,3,2,4]

sum(c_i)=6+3+2+4=15 >= 12, so -1.

But according to the problem, is there a solution?

Let's see:

We need sum(x_i) < min(k_i * x_i).

Given x_i = c_i, sum(x_i)=15, min(k_i * x_i)=min(2*6,4*3,6*2,3*4)=min(12,12,12,12)=12.

15 >=12, which violates the condition, so no solution exists, hence -1 is correct.

Another test case:

n=3, k=[2,3,4]

m=LCM(2,3,4)=12

c_i=[12//2,12//3,12//4]=[6,4,3]

sum(c_i)=6+4+3=13 < 12? No, 13 >=12, so -1.

But is there any other set of x_i where sum(x_i) < min(k_i * x_i)?

Suppose x_i=[3,2,2]

sum=7

k_i * x_i=[6,6,8]

min=6

7 < 6? No, 7 >=6, invalid.

Another try: x_i=[2,1,1]

sum=4

k_i * x_i=[4,3,4]

min=3

4 >=3, invalid.

Another try: x_i=[1,1,1]

sum=3

k_i * x_i=[2,3,4]

min=2

3 >=2, invalid.

Seems like no solution exists, so -1 is correct.

Another case:

n=1, k=[10]

m=10

c_i=[1]

sum=1 <10, which is correct.

Wait, but in the problem description, it says 2 <= k_i <=20, so k_i >=2.

But in this case, k_i=10, m=10, c_i=1, sum=1 <10, which is correct.

Another case:

n=2, k=[2,2]

m=2

c_i=[1,1]

sum=2 >=2, so -1.

But let's see:

Is there any x_i where sum(x_i) < min(k_i * x_i)?

Suppose x_i=[1,1], sum=2 >= min(2,2)=2, invalid.

x_i=[0,0], sum=0 <0, invalid as bets must be at least 1.

So, no solution exists, hence -1 is correct.

Seems like the program's logic is correct.

But let's see if there are cases where sum(m//k_i) < m, but there exists a better solution with smaller x_i.

For example:

n=3, k=[2,3,4]

m=LCM(2,3,4)=12

c_i=[6,4,3], sum=13 >=12, so -1.

But earlier attempts show no better solution exists.

Another example:

n=2, k=[2,3]

m=6

c_i=[3,2], sum=5 <6, which is correct.

Is there any other solution?

x_i=[2,2], sum=4 < min(4,6)=4, invalid.

x_i=[1,2], sum=3 < min(2,6)=2, invalid.

x_i=[3,2], sum=5 <6=6, correct.

So, the program's solution is correct.

Another example:

n=4, k=[2,3,4,5]

m=LCM(2,3,4,5)=60

c_i=[30,20,15,12], sum=30+20+15+12=77 >=60, so -1.

Is there any better solution?

Suppose x_i=[20,13,15,12]

sum=20+13+15+12=60 >= min(40,39,60,60)=39, invalid.

Another try: x_i=[25,15,10,10]

sum=60 >= min(50,45,40,30)=30, invalid.

Seems no solution exists, so -1 is correct.

One more example:

n=3, k=[2,4,8]

m=8

c_i=[4,2,1], sum=7 <8, which is correct.

Is there any better solution?

x_i=[3,2,1], sum=6 < min(6,8,8)=6, invalid.

x_i=[4,2,1], sum=7 <8, correct.

So, the program's solution is correct.

Now, is there any case where sum(m//k_i) >= m, but a solution exists with smaller x_i?

Let's see:

n=2, k=[2,4]

m=4

c_i=[2,1], sum=3 <4, which is correct.

But according to the program, sum=3 <4, so it's correct.

Another case:

n=2, k=[2,2]

m=2

c_i=[1,1], sum=2 >=2, so -1.

But earlier, we saw no solution exists, so correct.

Wait, what if n=2, k=[2,3]

m=6

c_i=[3,2], sum=5 <6, which is correct.

Another case:

n=3, k=[2,3,5]

m=30

c_i=[15,10,6], sum=31 >=30, so -1.

Is there any other solution with smaller x_i?

Suppose x_i=[14,10,6], sum=30 >= min(28,30,30)=28, invalid.

x_i=[13,10,6], sum=29 >=26, invalid.

x_i=[12,10,6], sum=28 >=24, invalid.

x_i=[11,10,6], sum=27 >=22, invalid.

x_i=[10,10,6], sum=26 >=20, invalid.

x_i=[9,10,6], sum=25 >=18, invalid.

x_i=[8,10,6], sum=24 >=16, invalid.

x_i=[7,10,6], sum=23 >=14, invalid.

x_i=[6,10,6], sum=22 >=12, invalid.

x_i=[5,10,6], sum=21 >=10, invalid.

x_i=[4,10,6], sum=20 >=8, invalid.

x_i=[3,10,6], sum=19 >=6, invalid.

x_i=[2,10,6], sum=18 >=4, invalid.

x_i=[1,10,6], sum=17 >=2, invalid.

No solution exists, so -1 is correct.

Seems like the program's logic is sound.

Let me check the constraints:

- 1 <= t <= 10^4

- 1 <= n <=50

- 2 <= k_i <=20

- Sum of n over all test cases <=2*10^5

The program should handle this efficiently since for each test case, it computes the LCM and then the c_i values, which is O(n) per test case.

Given that LCM for k_i up to 20 and n up to 50, m can be up to LCM of numbers up to 20, which is 232792560, which is fine since x_i can be up to 10^9.

The program uses integer division, which is correct.

Also, it's guaranteed that if a solution exists, there is one with x_i <=10^9, which is satisfied by this approach.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
