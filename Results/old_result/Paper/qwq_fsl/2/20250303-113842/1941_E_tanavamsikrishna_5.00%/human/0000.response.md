Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to solve a problem about building bridges over a river grid, minimizing the cost of installing supports for the bridges. There are constraints on where and how supports can be placed, and the goal is to choose the best rows to build k consecutive bridges.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. Let's break it down:

- We have a grid with n rows and m columns representing the river.

- Each cell (i,j) has a depth a_{i,j}, and the cells on the first and last columns (j=1 and j=m) have depth 0, representing the banks.

- We need to build k consecutive bridges on some rows i to i+k-1.

- For each bridge on a row, we need to place supports at the first and last columns, and possibly in between, with the distance between any two adjacent supports being at most d.

- The cost of placing a support at cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.

- We need to minimize the total cost of supports for the k consecutive bridges.

The program provided consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_2 seems to handle the input and orchestrate the process, while func_1 appears to calculate the cost for a single row.

Let's look at func_1 in detail:

def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

return row[-1]

This function takes a row (a list of integers representing depths) and d (the maximum distance between supports). It seems to compute the minimum cost for placing supports in this row.

It first handles the first d-1 columns by setting their cost to a_{i,j} + 1, which makes sense because these positions might need supports to satisfy the distance constraint.

Then, for positions from d-1 to the end of the row, it calculates the cost as the minimum cost from the previous d positions plus a_{i,j} + 1. This seems to implement a dynamic programming approach where each position's cost depends on the minimum cost of the preceding d positions.

Finally, it returns the cost at the last position, which should be the minimum cost for the entire row.

Now, func_2 handles the input and uses func_1 to compute the costs for each row, then finds the minimum total cost for any k consecutive rows.

def func_2():

(n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))

rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]

costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]

total_costs = []

for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):

total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))

print(min(total_costs))

This seems straightforward. It reads the input, processes each row to get the individual costs using func_1, then computes the sum of k consecutive costs and finds the minimum among them.

Now, to verify the correctness, I need to ensure that this program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all possible cases.

First potential issue: The way func_1 calculates the cost for each row.

Let's consider a simple example:

n=1, m=3, k=1, d=1

Row: [0, 1, 0]

According to the problem, supports must be placed at j=1 and j=3, and the distance between supports must be <= d=1.

Since d=1, the only allowed configuration is placing supports at j=1 and j=3.

The cost should be (0+1) + (0+1) = 2.

But let's see what func_1 does:

- For i=0 (d-1=0), set row[0] = 0 + 1 = 1

- For i=1 (since d-1=0 < 1 < len(row)=3), row[1] = min(row[0]) + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

- For i=2, row[2] = min(row[max(0,2-3):2]) = min(row[0:2]) = min(1,3)=1 + 0 + 1 = 2

- Finally, return row[-1] = 2

Wait, that's different from the expected cost of 2. But in this case, it seems correct because the cost is 2.

Another example:

n=1, m=4, k=1, d=2

Row: [0,1,2,0]

Possible support placements:

- At j=1 and j=4: cost = (0+1) + (0+1) = 2

- At j=1, j=3, j=4: cost = (0+1) + (2+1) + (0+1) = 4

The minimum cost is 2.

Let's see what func_1 does:

- i=0 (d-1=1), set row[0] = 0 + 1 = 1

- i=1 (1 < len(row)=4), row[1] = min(row[0:1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

- i=2, row[2] = min(row[1:2]) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6

- i=3, row[3] = min(row[2:3]) = 6 + 0 + 1 = 7

- Return row[-1] = 7

But the correct cost is 2, so this is incorrect.

This suggests that func_1 is not correctly calculating the cost for the row.

So, in this case, the program is incorrect because it doesn't handle the placement of supports correctly.

Wait, but according to the problem, supports must be placed at both ends, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be <= d.

In the second example, the program calculates a cost of 7, but the actual minimum cost is 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Another way to think about it: the dynamic programming in func_1 seems to assume that supports can be placed at any position, but in reality, supports must be placed at both ends, and the distance constraint applies to the placement in between.

Perhaps the DP needs to ensure that supports are placed at both ends and that the distance constraint is satisfied.

Alternatively, maybe the DP should consider the positions where supports are placed and ensure that the distance constraint is met.

I think the issue lies in how func_1 calculates the cost.

Let me think of a better way to model this.

For each row, we need to place supports at j=1 and j=m, and possibly at other positions such that any two adjacent supports are at most d columns apart.

The cost is the sum of a_{i,j} + 1 for each support placed at j.

To find the minimal cost, we can use dynamic programming where dp[j] represents the minimal cost to place supports from column 1 to j, inclusive.

The recurrence relation would be:

dp[j] = min over all possible previous support positions p, where p < j and j - p <= d+1 (since distance is |j - p| - 1), of dp[p] + cost at j.

But since supports must be placed at both ends, we need to ensure that dp[1] = a_{i,1} + 1, and dp[m] will be the total cost for the row.

Wait, but in the problem, the supports are placed at j=1 and j=m, and possibly at some positions in between.

So, perhaps dp[j] represents the minimal cost to place supports from j=1 to j, including a support at j.

Then, the transition would be:

dp[j] = min over p in [max(1, j - d - 1), j - 1] of dp[p] + (a_{i,j} + 1 if p < j else 0)

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let's consider that supports are placed at positions where we decide to place them, including mandatory positions at j=1 and j=m.

We need to ensure that between any two supports, the distance is at most d.

This sounds like a variant of the "jumping" DP, where we can jump up to d steps at a time.

In standard DP for this kind of problem, dp[j] represents the minimal cost to reach position j with supports placed according to the rules.

dp[j] = min(dp[p] + cost at j for p in [max(0, j - d - 1), j - 1] if p is a position with a support)

But in this problem, supports must be placed at both ends, and possibly at some internal positions.

I think a better way is to model dp[j] as the minimal cost to place supports from position 1 to j, with a support at j.

Then, dp[j] = min(dp[p] + (a_{i,j} + 1 if p < j else 0) for p in [max(0, j - d - 1), j - 1])

And dp[1] = a_{i,1} + 1

Finally, the cost for the row is dp[m]

Wait, but in the second example, with n=1, m=4, k=1, d=2, row=[0,1,2,0]

Let's compute dp:

dp[1] = 0 + 1 = 1

dp[2] = dp[1] + (1 + 1) = 1 + 2 = 3

dp[3] = min(dp[1] + (2 + 1), dp[2] + (2 + 1)) = min(1 + 3, 3 + 3) = min(4,6) = 4

dp[4] = min(dp[2] + (0 + 1), dp[3] + (0 + 1)) = min(3 + 1, 4 + 1) = min(4,5) = 4

So the total cost is 4, which matches the correct cost, not 7 as in the initial func_1.

So, the initial func_1 is incorrect because it doesn't correctly model the placement of supports.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

But according to the problem statement, if the program is incorrect, I should print "False", but also mention a case where it fails.

So, in this case, for the input:

1 4 1 2

0 1 2 0

The correct output should be 4, but according to func_1, it outputs 7, which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the examples provided in the problem, the program might be producing the correct output, but that doesn't mean it's correct if there exists at least one case where it fails.

So, I need to check if there's any case where the program doesn't produce the correct output.

From the above example, it seems that it fails for n=1, m=4, k=1, d=2 with row=[0,1,2,0]

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

I should print "False" and possibly mention the failing case.

But according to the instruction, I only need to print "False" if the program is incorrect.

So, my final answer is:

Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimal cost of installing supports for building k consecutive bridges over a river grid, ensuring that supports are placed at specified positions with certain constraints on their distances.

### Approach

1. **Problem Breakdown**:
    - We are given a grid of size n rows and m columns where each cell has a depth value.
    - We need to build k consecutive bridges on some rows, and for each bridge, supports must be placed at the first and last columns, and possibly in between, ensuring no two adjacent supports are more than d columns apart.
    - The cost of placing a support at any cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.

2. **Dynamic Programming for Single Row**:
    - For each row, calculate the minimal cost to place supports from the first column to the last column, ensuring supports are placed at both ends and the distance constraint is satisfied.
    - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimal cost up to each column.

3. **Calculate Total Cost for k Consecutive Rows**:
    - Compute the minimal support cost for each row using the dynamic programming approach.
    - Find the minimal sum of costs for any k consecutive rows.

### Solution Code

```python
from typing import List

def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    m = len(row)
    dp = [float('inf')] * m
    dp[0] = row[0] + 1  # Support at first column
    for j in range(1, m):
        for p in range(max(0, j - d - 1), j):
            if dp[p] != float('inf'):
                cost = dp[p] + (row[j] + 1 if p < j else 0)
                dp[j] = min(dp[j], cost)
        if j == m - 1:
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[0] + row[j] + 1)  # Ensure support at last column
    return dp[-1]

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k, d) = map(int, input().split())
        rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i+k]) for i in range(n - k + 1)]
        print(min(total_costs))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Explanation

1. **Single Row Cost Calculation**:
    - We use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the minimal cost to place supports from the first column up to the j-th column, including a support at j.
    - For each column j, we consider placing a support at j and take the minimum cost from previous valid positions p (where p is between j - d - 1 and j - 1).

2. **Total Cost for k Consecutive Rows**:
    - Compute the minimal support cost for each row using the dynamic programming approach.
    - Calculate the sum of costs for every k consecutive rows and select the minimum sum.

This approach ensures that we handle the constraints correctly and find the minimal total cost efficiently.
