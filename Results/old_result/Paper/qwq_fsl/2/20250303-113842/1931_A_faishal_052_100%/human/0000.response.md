Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partial correctness means it's incorrect. I have to analyze the source code to see if there's any missing logic or edge cases that aren't handled.

I've been given three examples to understand how this works. Let's look at them one by one.

**Example 1:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program: A function that checks if a number is not prime by iterating from 2 to n-1 and checking for factors.

- Example Answer: Correctness: **True**.

So, in this case, the program correctly identifies non-prime numbers, and there are no edge cases where it fails, hence it's True.

**Example 2:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to count all substrings starting and ending with the same character.

- Program: A function that iterates through the string and counts substrings where the starting and ending characters match.

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**.

Here, the program is considered incorrect, meaning there are cases where it doesn't count the substrings correctly. Maybe it misses some substrings or has logic errors.

**Example 3:**

- Problem Description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- Program: A binary search implementation with a while loop.

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**.

Again, the binary search implementation is incorrect, possibly due to a mistake in how the mid index is updated or how the search range is narrowed down.

From these examples, I understand that I need to be thorough in my analysis and consider various test cases, including edge cases, to ensure the program works as expected.

Now, moving on to my task:

**Problem Description:**

Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26, where "a" is 1 and "z" is 26. He encoded the word as the sum of the positions of its characters. For example, "cat" is encoded as 3 + 1 + 20 = 24. However, this encoding is ambiguous since different words can have the same sum, like "ava" also sums to 24.

The task is to determine the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could correspond to a given encoded sum.

**Input:**

- The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases.

- Each of the next t lines contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), the encoded sum for that test case.

**Output:**

- For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums to n.

**Example:**

- Input:

5

24

70

3

55

48

- Output:

aav

rzz

aaa

czz

auz

**Given Program:**

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the sum n. It then tries to find three letters that sum to n, choosing the lexicographically smallest ones.

Looking at the program:

- It initializes an empty list to store the results.

- For each test case, it initializes an empty list arr.

- It calculates the values for the first two letters based on the sum n.

- It appends values to arr based on certain conditions.

- It appends the remaining value to arr.

- It sorts arr and constructs the word by converting numbers to letters using chr(info[i][j] + 96).

I need to verify if this program correctly finds the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each given sum n across all test cases.

First, I need to understand the logic behind the program.

The program seems to be trying to assign the smallest possible letters for the first two positions and then calculate the third letter based on the remaining sum.

But the logic appears flawed because:

- It doesn't ensure that all three letters are between 1 and 26.

- It doesn't handle cases where the remaining sum for the third letter is less than 1 or greater than 26.

- It sorts the array after assigning values, which might not lead to the smallest lexicographical order.

Let me think about a correct approach.

To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should minimize the first letter, then the second, and then the third.

So, for each position, starting from the first:

- Assign the smallest possible letter (starting from 'a').

- Ensure that the remaining sum can be achieved with the remaining letters within the range 1 to 26.

This is similar to distributing the sum among three letters with constraints.

Let's consider an example:

- n = 24

Possible combinations:

- a (1), a (1), v (22) → aav

- a (1), b (2), u (21) → abu

- ... and so on.

But the smallest is aav.

Another example:

- n = 3

Only possible combination is a (1), a (1), a (1) → aaa

- n = 70

Possible combination: r (18), z (26), z (26) → rzz

- n = 55

c (3), z (26), z (26) → czz

- n = 48

a (1), u (21), z (26) → auz

Now, looking back at the given program, it seems to have a flawed logic in assigning the first two letters and then the third.

Let me try to find a test case where this program fails.

Consider n = 27

According to the program:

- For the first two letters:

- lex = 27

- First iteration (j=0):

- lex < 28: arr.append(1), lex = 27 -1 =26

- Second iteration (j=1):

- lex < 28: arr.append(1), lex =26-1=25

- Then arr.append(25)

- arr = [1,1,25]

- sorted arr = [1,1,25]

- word: a a y → aay

But is there a smaller lexicographical word?

Let's see:

- a a y: sum =1+1+25=27

- a b x: sum=1+2+24=27

- a c w: sum=1+3+22=27

- ...

- a z y: sum=1+26+26=53 (too high)

- b a x: sum=2+1+24=27

- b b w: sum=2+2+22=26 (too low)

- ...

So, aay is one option, but is there a smaller one?

Looking at the words:

- a a y

- a b x

- a c w

- ...

All of these start with 'a', and the second letter increases.

Among these, 'a a y' is the smallest because 'y' comes before 'z' etc.

Wait, but is there any combination where the first letter is 'a', second is 'a', and third is 'y'?

Yes, as above.

Is there any smaller than 'a a y'?

No, because any other combination would have the first letter as 'a', and the second letter as 'a', and third as 'y'.

So, 'a a y' seems correct.

But let's see what the program outputs for n=27.

According to the program's logic:

- arr = [1,1,25] → sorted to [1,1,25] → 'a a y'

Which is correct.

Another test case: n=28

- Possible combinations:

- a (1), a (1), z (26) → aaz

- a (1), b (2), y (25) → aby

- a (1), c (3), x (24) → acx

- ...

- The smallest is aaz.

According to the program:

- For n=28

- First iteration: lex=28 >27, so arr.append(1), lex=27

- Second iteration: lex=27 >26, so arr.append(1), lex=26

- Then arr.append(26)

- arr = [1,1,26] → sorted to [1,1,26] → 'a a z'

Which is correct.

Another test case: n=78

- Maximum sum: z z z → 26+26+26=78

- So, the smallest lexicographical word is 'r z z'? Wait, no.

Wait, in the example output for n=70 it's 'r z z', but for n=78 it should be 'z z z'.

Wait, but according to the example output given:

Input:

5

24

70

3

55

48

Output:

aav

rzz

aaa

czz

auz

So, for n=70, it's 'r z z', but for n=78, it should be 'z z z'.

But in the program, for n=70:

- lex=70

- First iteration: lex=70 >27, so arr.append(26), lex=70-26=44

- Second iteration: lex=44 >27, so arr.append(26), lex=44-26=18

- Then arr.append(18) → r

- arr = [26,26,18] → sorted to [18,26,26] → 'r z z'

Which is correct.

For n=78:

- lex=78

- First iteration: lex=78 >27, so arr.append(26), lex=78-26=52

- Second iteration: lex=52 >27, so arr.append(26), lex=52-26=26

- Then arr.append(26) → z

- arr = [26,26,26] → sorted to [26,26,26] → 'z z z'

Which matches the expected output.

Wait, but in the example output for n=70 it's 'r z z', which seems correct.

Another test case: n=3

- arr = [1,1,1] → 'a a a'

Correct.

n=55

- arr = [3,26,26] → 'c z z'

Correct.

n=48

- arr = [1,21,26] → 'a u z'

Correct.

So, based on these test cases, the program seems to be working correctly.

But I need to make sure that this logic works for all possible cases.

Let me think about the logic:

- For the first two letters, if the remaining sum is less than 27, assign 1; else assign 26.

- Then assign the remaining value to the third letter.

- Sort the array to get the smallest lexicographical order.

Wait, but sorting the array might not always give the correct result.

Wait, in the example for n=24, the output is 'a a v', which is correct.

According to the program:

- For n=24

- First iteration: lex=24 <28, arr.append(1), lex=23

- Second iteration: lex=23 <28, arr.append(1), lex=22

- Then arr.append(22) → v

- arr = [1,1,22] → sorted to [1,1,22] → 'a a v'

Correct.

Another case: n=25

- arr = [1,1,23] → 'a a w'

Is there a smaller word? No.

Seems correct.

But wait, what about n=26?

- arr = [1,1,24] → 'a a x'

But 'a b z' sums to 1+2+26=29, which is more than 26.

So 'a a x' is correct.

Another case: n=26

- arr = [1,1,24] → 'a a x'

But 'a b y' sums to 1+2+25=28, which is more than 26.

So 'a a x' is correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but is there a combination where sorting the array doesn't give the smallest lexicographical word?

Let me think.

Suppose n=26.

- 'a a x' is correct.

But what if we have 'a b y', which sums to 28, which is invalid.

So, 'a a x' is the smallest.

Another case: n=25

- 'a a w'

Is there any other combination like 'a b v' which sums to 1+2+22=25.

But 'a a w' is smaller than 'a b v'.

So, 'a a w' is correct.

Another case: n=4

- arr = [1,1,2] → 'a a b'

Is there a smaller word? No.

Correct.

Wait, but according to the program:

- For n=4

- First iteration: lex=4 <28, arr.append(1), lex=3

- Second iteration: lex=3 <28, arr.append(1), lex=2

- Then arr.append(2) → b

- arr = [1,1,2] → sorted to [1,1,2] → 'a a b'

Correct.

Seems fine.

Wait, but I need to check if the program handles cases where the remaining sum after assigning the first two letters is less than 1 or more than 26.

For example, n=2

- But n is at least 3, as per the problem description.

So, n=3 is the minimum.

Wait, n=3

- arr = [1,1,1] → 'a a a'

Correct.

n=4

- arr = [1,1,2] → 'a a b'

Correct.

n=5

- arr = [1,1,3] → 'a a c'

Correct.

Seems consistent.

Another potential edge case: n=78

- arr = [26,26,26] → 'z z z'

Correct.

n=77

- arr = [26,26,25] → 'z z y'

Correct.

n=76

- arr = [26,26,24] → 'z z x'

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but in the program, it's using a loop for j in range(2):

- If lex <28, assign 1

- Else, assign 26

Wait, but 28 is hard-coded here, but in the earlier examples, it seems to work.

But why 28? 28 is 1+26+1, but I'm not sure about the logic behind it.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, in the program, it's:

for j in range(2):

if lex <28:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex -1

elif lex <52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

elif lex <=78:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

Then, arr.append(lex)

So, for j in range(2), it assigns the first two letters based on the remaining sum.

Let me analyze this.

- For n=24

- lex=24

- j=0:

- lex=24 <28 → arr.append(1), lex=23

- j=1:

- lex=23 <28 → arr.append(1), lex=22

- Then arr.append(22) → v

- arr = [1,1,22] → sorted to [1,,1,22] → 'a a v'

Correct.

- For n=70

- lex=70

- j=0:

- lex=70 >27, so arr.append(26), lex=70-26=44

- j=1:

- lex=44 >27, arr.append(26), lex=44-26=18

- arr.append(18) → r

- arr = [26,26,18] → sorted to [18,26,26] → 'r z z'

Correct.

Seems to work.

But is there a case where this logic fails?

Let me consider n=52

- lex=52

- j=0:

- lex=52 >27, arr.append(26), lex=52-26=26

- j=1:

- lex=26 <28, arr.append(1), lex=26-1=25

- arr.append(25) → y

- arr = [26,1,25] → sorted to [1,25,26] → 'a y z'

But is there a smaller word?

- 'a a z' sums to 1+1+26=28, which is less than 52.

- 'a b z' sums to 1+2+26=29

- 'a c z' sums to 1+3+26=30

- ...

- 'a z z' sums to 1+26+26=53, which is more than 52.

- 'b z z' sums to 2+26+26=54, which is more.

- So, 'a y z' sums to 1+25+26=52, which is correct.

But is there a smaller word than 'a y z'?

- 'a a z' is 28, which is less than 52.

Wait, but 'a a z' sums to 28, which is less than 52, so it's invalid.

- 'a b z' sums to 29

- 'a c z' to 30

- ...

- 'a y z' to 52

So, 'a y z' is the smallest word summing to 52.

But according to the program, it outputs 'r z z' for n=70, which is correct.

Wait, but for n=52, the program outputs 'a y z', which is correct.

So, seems okay.

Wait, but in the problem description, for n=55, it's 'c z z'.

Let me check:

- 'c z z' sums to 3+26+26=55, which is correct.

- Is there a smaller word?

- 'a a z' sums to 28, which is less.

- 'a b z' to 29

- 'a c z' to 30

- ...

- 'a y z' to 52

- 'a z z' to 53

- 'b z z' to 54

- 'c z z' to 55

So, 'c z z' is the smallest for n=55.

According to the program:

- lex=55

- j=0:

- lex=55 >27, arr.append(26), lex=55-26=29

- j=1:

- lex=29 >27, arr.append(26), lex=29-26=3

- arr.append(3) → c

- arr = [26,26,3] → sorted to [3,26,26] → 'c z z'

Correct.

Seems fine.

Another test case: n=26

- arr = [1,1,24] → 'a a x'

Is there a smaller word? No.

Correct.

n=27

- arr = [1,1,25] → 'a a y'

Correct.

n=28

- arr = [1,1,26] → 'a a z'

Correct.

n=29

- arr = [1,26,26] → 'a z z'

Correct.

n=30

- arr = [26,26,4] → 'd z z'

But is there a smaller word?

- 'a a z' sums to 28

- 'a b z' sums to 29

- 'a c z' sums to 30

So, 'a c z' is smaller than 'd z z'.

Wait, but according to the program:

- lex=30

- j=0:

- lex=30 >27, arr.append(26), lex=30-26=4

- j=1:

- lex=4 <28, arr.append(1), lex=4-1=3

- arr.append(3) → c

- arr = [26,1,3] → sorted to [1,3,26] → 'a c z'

Which is correct.

So, 'a c z' is indeed the smallest for n=30.

Seems the program is working correctly.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought sorting the array might not give the correct result, but in practice, it seems to work.

Because by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then the remaining to the third, and sorting to make sure the smallest letters come first, it seems to achieve the desired lexicographical order.

But perhaps there's a case where this logic fails.

Let me think of n=50.

- arr = [26,26,18] → 'r z z'

But is there a smaller word?

- 'a a z' sums to 28

- 'a b z' to 29

- ...

- 'a y z' to 52

- 'a z z' to 53

- 'b z z' to 54

- 'c z z' to 55

- 'd z z' to 56

- ...

- 'r z z' to 18+26+26=70, which is more than 50.

Wait, 18+26+26=70, which is more than 50.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, 18+26+26=70, which is more than 50.

But n=50.

Wait, according to the program:

- lex=50

- j=0:

- lex=50 >27, arr.append(26), lex=50-26=24

- j=1:

- lex=24 <28, arr.append(1), lex=24-1=23

- arr.append(23) → w

- arr = [26,1,23] → sorted to [1,23,26] → 'a w z'

Sum: 1+23+26=50.

Is there a smaller word than 'a w z'?

- 'a a z' sums to 28

- 'a b z' to 29

- 'a c z' to 30

- ...

- 'a w z' to 50.

Yes, 'a w z' is the smallest for n=50.

So, the program outputs the correct word.

Another test case: n=51

- arr = [26,26,26-1=25] → 'y z z'

Wait, no.

According to the program:

- lex=51

- j=0:

- lex=51 >27, arr.append(26), lex=51-26=25

- j=1:

- lex=25 <28, arr.append(1), lex=25-1=24

- arr.append(24) → x

- arr = [26,1,24] → sorted to [1,24,26] → 'a x z'

Sum: 1+24+26=51.

Is there a smaller word?

- 'a a z' to 28

- 'a b z' to 29

- ...

- 'a x z' to 51.

Yes, 'a x z' is the smallest.

Correct.

Seems the program is working correctly.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a case where the program assigns incorrect values.

Let's try n=75.

- arr = [26,26,26-1=23] → 'w z z'

Wait, no.

According to the program:

- lex=75

- j=0:

- lex=75 >27, arr.append(26), lex=75-26=49

- j=1:

- lex=49 >27, arr.append(26), lex=49-26=23

- arr.append(23) → w

- arr = [26,26,23] → sorted to [23,26,26] → 'w z z'

Sum: 23+26+26=75.

Is there a smaller word?

- 'a a z' to 28

- 'a b z' to 29

- ...

- 'w z z' to 23+26+26=75.

Yes, 'w z z' is the smallest.

But is there 'a z z' which sums to 1+26+26=53, which is less than 75.

But 'w z z' is smaller than 'x z z', etc.

Wait, no, 'a z z' is 53, which is less than 75, but we need to reach 75.

So, 'a z z' is invalid because it's only 53.

So, 'w z z' is the smallest valid word for n=75.

Seems correct.

Another test case: n=52

- arr = [26,26,18-1=17] → 'q z z'

Wait, no.

According to the program:

- lex=52

- j=0:

- lex=52 >27, arr.append(26), lex=52-26=26

- j=1:

- lex=26 <28, arr.append(1), lex=26-1=25

- arr.append(25) → y

- arr = [26,1,25] → sorted to [1,25,26] → 'a y z'

Sum: 1+25+26=52.

Is there a smaller word? No.

Correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if the program handles cases where the remaining sum after assigning the first two letters is less than 1 or more than 26.

For example, n=2

- But n is at least 3, so invalid.

n=3

- arr = [1,1,1] → 'a a a'

Correct.

n=26

- arr = [1,1,24] → 'a a x'

Correct.

n=27

- arr = [1,1,25] → 'a a y'

Correct.

n=28

- arr = [1,1,26] → 'a a z'

Correct.

n=29

- arr = [1,26,26] → 'a z z'

Correct.

n=52

- arr = [26,1,25] → 'a y z'

Correct.

n=78

- arr = [26,26,26] → 'z z z'

Correct.

Seems like the program is correctly handling these cases.

I can't find any test case where the program fails to produce the correct smallest lexicographical word for the given sum n.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: }\textbf{True}} \]
