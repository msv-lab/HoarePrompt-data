Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

I've reviewed the provided program for the given problem, and I believe it correctly implements the required functionality. The program uses a `SortedList` from the `sortedcontainers` module to maintain a sorted list of mushroom values. It then iterates through the permutation, removing mushrooms from the sorted list and calculating the maximum possible strength of the elixir.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the number of mushrooms `n`.
     - Read the list of mushroom values `a`.
     - Read the permutation `b`.

2. **Using SortedList:**
   - Create a `SortedList` from the mushroom values `a`. This ensures that the mushrooms are always sorted.

3. **Iterate through possible k values:**
   - For each `k` from 1 to `n`:
     - Calculate the strength of the elixir if `k` mushrooms are picked.
     - The strength is `k` multiplied by the smallest mushroom value among the remaining mushrooms.
     - Update the maximum strength and the corresponding `k` if the current strength is greater.
     - Remove the mushroom at position `b[k-1]` from the sorted list.

4. **Output the result:**
   - Print the maximum strength and the corresponding `k`.

### Why the Program is Correct

1. **Maintaining Sorted Order:**
   - The `SortedList` ensures that the mushrooms are always sorted, allowing efficient retrieval of the smallest remaining mushroom value.

2. **Correct Calculation of Elixir Strength:**
   - The strength is correctly calculated as `k * min_value`, where `min_value` is the smallest mushroom value among the remaining mushrooms.

3. **Efficient Removal of Mushrooms:**
   - Mushrooms are removed from the sorted list in O(log n) time using the `discard` method, maintaining the sorted order.

4. **Permutation Handling:**
   - The permutation `b` dictates the order in which mushrooms lose their magic power. By iterating through `b` and removing the corresponding mushrooms from the sorted list, the program correctly simulates the effect of picking `k` mushrooms.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k=1` or `k=n`, and when all mushrooms have the same value.
   - It also handles cases where removing a mushroom affects the minimum value for subsequent `k` values.

Given the above points, I conclude that the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases as per the problem description.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew an elixir of maximum possible strength, considering the constraints provided by the Wise Oak.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have `n` mushrooms, each with a magic power value.
   - We need to pick `k` mushrooms in a specific order defined by a permutation `p`.
   - After picking `k` mushrooms, the magic power of mushrooms at positions `p_1` to `p_{k-1}` becomes zero.
   - We need to find the maximum strength of the elixir, which is the product of the number of mushrooms (`k`) and the minimum magic power among the chosen mushrooms, and the smallest `k` that achieves this maximum strength.

2. **Use a Sorted List:**
   - Use a `SortedList` to maintain the mushrooms in sorted order for efficient retrieval of the smallest mushroom value.
   - Iterate through possible values of `k` from 1 to `n`, calculating the elixir strength for each and keeping track of the maximum strength and the corresponding `k`.

3. **Simulate the Permutation Effect:**
   - For each `k`, remove the mushroom at position `p_k` from the sorted list to simulate the effect of picking `k` mushrooms.
   - Calculate the strength as `k * min_value`, where `min_value` is the smallest remaining mushroom value.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the maximum strength and the smallest `k` that achieves this strength for each test case.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the number of mushrooms `n`.
     - Read the list of mushroom values `a`.
     - Read the permutation `b`.

2. **Using SortedList:**
   - Create a `SortedList` from the mushroom values `a`. This ensures that the mushrooms are always sorted.

3. **Iterate through possible k values:**
   - For each `k` from 1 to `n`:
     - Calculate the strength of the elixir if `k` mushrooms are picked.
     - The strength is `k` multiplied by the smallest mushroom value among the remaining mushrooms.
     - Update the maximum strength and the corresponding `k` if the current strength is greater.
     - Remove the mushroom at position `b[k-1]` from the sorted list.

4. **Output the result:**
   - Print the maximum strength and the corresponding `k`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently manage the sorted order of mushrooms and correctly simulate the effects of the permutation, allowing us to find the optimal solution for each test case.
