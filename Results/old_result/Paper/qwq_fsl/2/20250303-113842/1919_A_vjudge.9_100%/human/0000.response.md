Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program is completely correct.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the program.

### Problem Description

Alice and Bob are playing a game with their wallets. Alice has `a` coins, and Bob has `b` coins. They take turns, with Alice starting first. In each turn, the player:

1. Chooses to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep the current wallet.
2. Removes 1 coin from their current wallet. The wallet cannot have 0 coins before this step.

The player who cannot make a valid move loses. Both play optimally. Determine who wins.

### Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Analysis

First, I need to understand the logic behind the program. The program simply checks if the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have is even or odd. If it's even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

I need to verify if this logic is correct for all possible cases. To do this, I should understand the game mechanics and see if the winner can indeed be determined just by checking if the difference in coins is even or odd.

### Understanding the Game

Let's try to understand the game step by step.

- **Initial State:** Alice has `a` coins, Bob has `b` coins.
- **Turn Mechanics:**
  - Choose to swap wallets or keep the current one.
  - Remove 1 coin from the current wallet.
- **Loss Condition:** Cannot make a valid move, i.e., the current wallet has 0 coins and swapping isn't an option.

Since both players play optimally, they will always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

### Simplifying the Problem

I need to find a pattern or a mathematical relationship that can determine the winner based on the initial number of coins.

Let's consider some small values for `a` and `b` and see who wins.

#### Case 1: a = 1, b = 1

- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Alice chooses either, say Option 2: a=0, b=1
- Bob's turn:
  - Cannot swap since a=0, so must keep b=1 -> remove 1: a=0, b=0
- Alice's turn:
  - Cannot remove from a=0, cannot swap since b=0
  - Cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

#### Case 2: a = 1, b = 4

- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=4, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=3, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=4) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=4
  - If Alice chooses Option 1: a=3, b=1
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=3
  - Option 2: Keep (a=3, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=1
  - Bob chooses Option 2: a=2, b=1
- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=2
  - Option 2: Keep (a=2, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1
  - Alice chooses Option 2: a=1, b=1
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=0, b=1
- Alice's turn:
  - Cannot swap since a=0, keep b=1 -> remove 1: a=0, b=0
- Bob's turn:
  - Cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

From these cases, it seems that the difference being odd or even might correlate with the winner, but I need to verify this pattern with more cases.

#### Case 3: a = 2, b = 2

- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=2, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=2
  - Option 2: Keep (a=2, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=2
  - Alice chooses either, say Option 2: a=1, b=2
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=2, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=2
  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=1, b=1
- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Alice chooses Option 1: a=0, b=1
- Bob's turn:
  - Cannot swap since a=0, keep b=1 -> remove 1: a=0, b=0
- Alice's turn:
  - Cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

Here, a=2, b=2 (difference 0, even), Bob wins.

#### Case 4: a = 3, b = 2

- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=2, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=3
  - Option 2: Keep (a=3, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=2
  - Alice chooses Option 1: a=1, b=3
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=3, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=3
  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=2, b=1
- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=2
  - Option 2: Keep (a=2, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1
  - Alice chooses Option 2: a=1, b=1
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=0, b=1
- Alice's turn:
  - Cannot swap since a=0, keep b=1 -> remove 1: a=0, b=0
- Bob's turn:
  - Cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Here, a=3, b=2 (difference 1, odd), Alice wins.

### General Pattern

From the above cases:

- When the difference is even, Bob wins.
- When the difference is odd, Alice wins.

This seems to hold for the cases I've tested. But I need to see if this holds universally.

### Trying to Find a Counterexample

Let's try a more complex case to see if this pattern holds.

#### Case 5: a = 4, b = 2

- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=2, b=4) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=4
  - Option 2: Keep (a=4, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=3, b=2
  - Alice chooses Option 1: a=1, b=4
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=4, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=3, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=4) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=4
  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=3, b=1
- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=3
  - Option 2: Keep (a=3, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=1
  - Alice chooses Option 2: a=2, b=1
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=2
  - Option 2: Keep (a=2, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1
  - Bob chooses Option 2: a=1, b=1
- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Alice chooses Option 1: a=0, b=1
- Bob's turn:
  - Cannot swap since a=0, keep b=1 -> remove 1: a=0, b=0
- Alice's turn:
  - Cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

Here, a=4, b=2 (difference 2, even), Bob wins.

#### Case 6: a = 5, b = 3

- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=3, b=5) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=5
  - Option 2: Keep (a=5, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=4, b=3
  - Alice chooses Option 1: a=2, b=5
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=5, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=4, b=2
  - Option 2: Keep (a=2, b=5) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=5
  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=4, b=2
- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=2, b=4) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=4
  - Option 2: Keep (a=4, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=3, b=2
  - Alice chooses Option 1: a=1, b=4
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=4, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=3, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=4) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=4
  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=3, b=1
- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=3
  - Option 2: Keep (a=3, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=1
  - Alice chooses Option 2: a=2, b=1
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=2
  - Option 2: Keep (a=2, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1
  - Bob chooses Option 2: a=1, b=1
- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Alice chooses Option 1: a=0, b=1
- Bob's turn:
  - Cannot swap since a=0, keep b=1 -> remove 1: a=0, b=0
- Alice's turn:
  - Cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

Here, a=5, b=3 (difference 2, even), Bob wins.

Wait, but according to the earlier pattern, when the difference is even, Bob wins, and when it's odd, Alice wins. But in the second example, a=1, b=4 (difference 3, odd), Alice wins, which matches the pattern. In this last case, a=5, b=3 (difference 2, even), Bob wins, which also matches.

But let's check another case where difference is odd.

#### Case 7: a=3, b=4

- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=4, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=3, b=3
  - Option 2: Keep (a=3, b=4) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=4
  - Alice chooses Option 1: a=3, b=3
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=3, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=3
  - Option 2: Keep (a=3, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=3
  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=2, b=3
- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=3, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=2
  - Option 2: Keep (a=2, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=3
  - Alice chooses Option 1: a=2, b=2
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=2, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=2
  - Option 2: Keep (a=2, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=2
  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=1, b=2
- Alice's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=2, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=2
  - Alice chooses Option 1: a=1, b=1
- Bob's turn:
  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1
  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=0, b=1
- Alice's turn:
  - Cannot swap since a=0, keep b=1 -> remove 1: a=0, b=0
- Bob's turn:
  - Cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Here, a=3, b=4 (difference 1, odd), Alice wins.

This again matches the pattern.

### Generalizing the Pattern

From all these cases, it seems that the difference between `a` and `b` being even or odd determines the winner. Specifically:

- If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob wins.
- If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins.

But I need to ensure that this holds for all possible values of `a` and `b`, not just these specific cases.

### Considering the Game Mechanics

Let's think about the game in terms of game theory, specifically the concept of "Nim" or other impartial games.

In this game, the players can choose to swap or not, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty or when the current wallet has zero coins and swapping isn't helpful.

Given that both players play optimally, the game's outcome depends on the initial positions and the possible moves.

### Simplifying the Game State

Let's consider the game state as a pair (a, b), where a and b are the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Each move consists of:

1. Choosing to swap or not.
2. Removing one coin from the current wallet.

The game ends when a player cannot remove a coin because their current wallet has zero coins.

### Finding a Winning Strategy

To find a general winning strategy, let's consider the parity of a and b.

From the earlier cases, it seems that the difference in the number of coins determines the winner.

But perhaps there's a better way to look at it.

Let's consider the total number of coins: t = a + b.

Each move reduces the total number of coins by one, since one coin is removed each turn.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which occurs when their current wallet has zero coins and swapping doesn't help.

But this seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a different approach.

### Considering the Number of Moves

Since each move reduces the total coins by one, the total number of moves possible is a + b.

However, the game doesn't necessarily last for a + b moves because a player might be unable to move earlier if their wallet is empty.

Given that, perhaps the parity of the difference a - b is not directly related to the winner.

Let me think differently.

### Analyzing the Game as an Impartial Game

In combinatorial game theory, games where the available moves depend only on the position and not on which player's turn it is are called impartial games. However, in this game, the moves available depend on which player is moving because of the swapping option.

Therefore, it's a partisan game.

### Trying to Find a Grundy Number or Mex

In impartial games, we can use the concept of Grundy numbers or mex to determine the game's outcome. However, since this is a partisan game, that approach might not directly apply.

### Looking for a Symmetry

Let's look for some symmetry in the game.

If a = b, then the difference is zero, which is even, and according to the program, Bob wins.

In the first case, where a = 1 and b = 1, Bob wins.

In the case where a = 2 and b = 2, Bob wins.

In the case where a = 3 and b = 3, following similar steps would likely lead to Bob winning again.

So, when a = b, Bob wins.

When a and b differ by an even number, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

### Considering Parity of Differences

Let’s consider that the difference d = |a - b|.

If d is even, Bob wins; else, Alice wins.

Is there a way to generalize this?

Let’s think about the binary operations or modular arithmetic.

### Trying to Find a Counterexample

To disprove the program's logic, I need to find at least one case where the difference is even, but Alice wins, or the difference is odd, but Bob wins.

Looking back at the examples provided in the problem:

Input:

10

1 1

1 4

5 3

4 5

11 9

83 91

1032 9307

839204 7281

1000000000 1000000000

53110 2024

Output:

Bob

Alice

Bob

Alice

Bob

Bob

Alice

Alice

Bob

Bob

According to the program's logic:

- For a=1, b=1: difference=0 (even) → Bob wins. Matches the output.

- For a=1, b=4: difference=3 (odd) → Alice wins. Matches the output.

- For a=5, b=3: difference=2 (even) → Bob wins. Matches the output.

- For a=4, b=5: difference=1 (odd) → Alice wins. Matches the output.

- For a=11, b=9: difference=2 (even) → Bob wins. Matches the output.

- For a=83, b=91: difference=8 (even) → Bob wins. Matches the output.

- For a=1032, b=9307: difference=8275 (odd) → Alice wins. Matches the output.

- For a=839204, b=7281: difference=831923 (odd) → Alice wins. Matches the output.

- For a=1000000000, b=1000000000: difference=0 (even) → Bob wins. Matches the output.

- For a=53110, b=2024: difference=51086 (even) → Bob wins. Matches the output.

All these cases match the program's output, so no counterexample is found here.

### Testing Additional Cases

Let me try to find a case where the difference is even, but Alice wins, or vice versa.

#### Case 8: a=2, b=1

Difference: 1 (odd) → Alice wins.

Let's play it out:

- Alice's turn:

  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=2) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=2

  - Option 2: Keep (a=2, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1

  - Alice chooses Option 2: a=1, b=1

- Bob's turn:

  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1

  - Option 2: Keep (a=1, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1

  - Bob chooses Option 1: a=0, b=1

- Alice's turn:

  - Cannot swap since a=0, keep b=1 -> remove 1: a=0, b=0

- Bob's turn:

  - Cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

This matches the pattern.

#### Case 9: a=3, b=1

Difference: 2 (even) → Bob wins.

Let's play it out:

- Alice's turn:

  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=3) -> remove 1 from a: a=0, b=3

  - Option 2: Keep (a=3, b=1) -> remove 1 from a: a=2, b=1

  - Alice chooses Option 2: a=2, b=1

- Bob's turn:

  - Option 1: Swap (a=1, b=
