Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The goal is to determine whether the program meets the requirements as specified, and to print "True" if it does, or "False" otherwise. I need to ensure that the program handles all potential cases correctly, and that it doesn't have any logical errors or edge cases that it misses.

First, I need to understand the problem description thoroughly. Let's read it again:

"Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18}.

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: she will go to stall 1, buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2, buy as many jewels as possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins."

So, the key points here are:

1. Bob can set up to 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and 10^{18}.

2. Alice buys jewels greedily: she buys as many jewels as possible from each stall in sequence until she has bought exactly k jewels or there are no more stalls.

3. Alice doesn't need to spend all her coins; she stops once she has bought k jewels.

4. We need to determine if it's possible for Bob to set up the stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels, and if so, provide the number of stalls and their prices.

The program needs to handle multiple test cases, each with values of n (coins) and k (desired jewels to be bought).

Looking at the provided program, it seems to attempt to solve this problem. However, I need to verify if it correctly handles all possible cases.

Let's look at the program:

```python

import math as m

import collections as c

"""

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int,input().split()))



# Read tree as graph

# Generic BS

def bs(arr,x):

n = len(arr)

l, r = 0, n - 1

if x < arr[0]: return -1

if x > arr[-1]: return n+1

while l + 1 != r:

mid = (l + r) // 2

if x <= arr[mid]:

r = mid

else:

l = mid

return (l,r)

"""

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):

if n == k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(1)

return

if n < k:

print('NO')

return

costs = [n - k + 1, 1]

h = 0

for i in costs:

curr = n // i

h += curr

n -= i * curr

if h < k:

print('NO')

else:

print(2)

print('YES')

print(*costs)

```

First, there's some irrelevant code at the beginning, which seems to be leftovers from previous problems or functions. I should ignore that and focus on the relevant part, which is the `func_1` function and the main loop that calls it.

The function `func_1(n, k)` seems to handle each test case. Let's see what it does.

1. If n equals k, it prints 'YES', followed by 1 and then 1. This means it sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. If n equals k, Alice will buy k jewels at 1 coin each, spending n coins, which matches the condition.

2. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO'. This makes sense because Alice cannot buy more jewels than the number of coins she has.

3. Otherwise, it sets up two stalls with prices [n - k + 1, 1]. Then it calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from these two stalls.

Let's understand the logic behind choosing [n - k + 1, 1] as the prices.

- At the first stall, the price is p1 = n - k + 1.

- Alice can buy floor(n / p1) jewels from the first stall.

- Then, she proceeds to the second stall with the remaining coins.

- At the second stall, the price is p2 = 1, so she can buy as many jewels as she has coins left.

The program then checks if the total jewels bought (h) is less than k. If it is, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES', the number of stalls (2), and the prices.

But I need to verify if this always works.

Let me consider some examples.

**Example 1:**

Input:

3

7 3

6 4

255 8

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

NO

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

In the first test case, n=7, k=3.

The program sets up two stalls with prices [7 - 3 + 1 = 5, 1], so [5,1].

- At stall 1 (price 5), Alice can buy 7 // 5 = 1 jewel, spending 5 coins. Remaining coins: 2.

- At stall 2 (price 1), Alice can buy 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, spending 2 coins. Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3.

- Since h = 3 == k, it should print 'YES' and the prices [5,1].

But in the example output, it shows 'YES', 10, and prices from 2 to 11. This seems different from what the program does. So maybe the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the program is not matching the expected output format in the example. In the example, for the first test case, it shows 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, but the program only sets up 2 stalls with [5,1]. So there might be multiple ways to achieve the goal, and the program chooses a different approach.

But as long as it sets up at most 60 stalls and achieves the goal, it should be acceptable.

Let me check if the program's approach is correct.

In the first case, n=7, k=3.

Program sets up [5,1]:

- Buys 1 jewel from stall 1 (spends 5 coins), remaining 2 coins.

- Buys 2 jewels from stall 2 (spends 2 coins), total jewels = 3.

- So h = 3 == k, which is correct.

In the third case, n=255, k=8.

Program sets up [255 - 8 + 1 = 248, 1]:

- At stall 1 (248), buys 255 // 248 = 1 jewel, spends 248 coins, remaining 7 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 7 // 1 = 7 jewels, total jewels = 1 + 7 = 8.

- Which matches k=8.

Seems correct.

But in the second test case, n=6, k=4.

Program sets up [6 - 4 + 1 = 3, 1]:

- At stall 1 (3), buys 6 // 3 = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy any more jewels since no coins left.

- Total jewels = 2 < 4.

- So h = 2 < k=4, so it prints 'NO', which matches the example output.

So far, so good.

But I need to think about other cases.

**Case 1: n=1, k=1**

- Program sets up [1 - 1 + 1 = 1, 1], so [1,1].

- At stall 1 (1), buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels = 1 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 2: n=1, k=2**

- n < k, so 'NO'.

**Case 3: n=5, k=2**

- Sets up [5 - 2 + 1 = 4, 1], so [4,1].

- At stall 1 (4), buys 5 // 4 = 1 jewel, spends 4 coins, remaining 1 coin.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin.

- Total jewels = 1 + 1 = 2 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 4: n=10, k=5**

- Sets up [10 - 5 + 1 = 6, 1], so [6,1].

- At stall 1 (6), buys 10 // 6 = 1 jewel, spends 6 coins, remaining 4 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 4 // 1 = 4 jewels, spends 4 coins.

- Total jewels = 1 + 4 = 5 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 5: n=10, k=4**

- Sets up [10 - 4 + 1 = 7, 1], so [7,1].

- At stall 1 (7), buys 10 // 7 = 1 jewel, spends 7 coins, remaining 3 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 3 // 1 = 3 jewels, spends 3 coins.

- Total jewels = 1 + 3 = 4 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 6: n=10, k=3**

- Sets up [10 - 3 + 1 = 8, 1], so [8,1].

- At stall 1 (8), buys 10 // 8 = 1 jewel, spends 8 coins, remaining 2 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins.

- Total jewels = 1 + 2 = 3 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 7: n=10, k=6**

- Sets up [10 - 6 + 1 = 5, 1], so [5,1].

- At stall 1 (5), buys 10 // 5 = 2 jewels, spends 10 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels = 2 < 6, so 'NO'.

Wait, but in this case, is there a way to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 6 jewels with 10 coins?

Let's see:

- If Bob sets up one stall with price 1, Alice would buy 10 jewels, which is more than 6.

- If he sets up two stalls: [2,1]

- At stall 1 (2), buys 10 // 2 = 5 jewels, spends 10 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels = 5 < 6, so 'NO'.

- Another option: [3,1]

- At stall 1 (3), buys 10 // 3 = 3 jewels, spends 9 coins, remaining 1 coin.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin.

- Total jewels = 3 + 1 = 4 < 6, so 'NO'.

- Another option: [2,2]

- At stall 1 (2), buys 10 // 2 = 5 jewels, spends 10 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (2), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels = 5 < 6, so 'NO'.

- Another option: [1,2]

- At stall 1 (1), buys 10 // 1 = 10 jewels, spends 10 coins.

- Stops, since she already bought more than 6 jewels.

- But she bought 10 jewels, which is more than 6, so doesn't meet the requirement of exactly 6.

So in this case, it seems impossible to make Alice buy exactly 6 jewels with 10 coins and up to 60 stalls.

Hence, 'NO' is the correct answer.

So, the program seems to handle this case correctly.

**Case 8: n=1, k=1**

- Already covered, works correctly.

**Case 9: n=2, k=1**

- Sets up [2 - 1 + 1 = 2, 1], so [2,1].

- At stall 1 (2), buys 2 // 2 = 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels = 1 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 10: n=2, k=2**

- n == k, so sets up one stall with price 1.

- Buys 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, which matches k=2, so 'YES'.

**Case 11: n=5, k=3**

- Sets up [5 - 3 + 1 = 3, 1], so [3,1].

- At stall 1 (3), buys 5 // 3 = 1 jewel, spends 3 coins, remaining 2 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins.

- Total jewels = 1 + 2 = 3 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 12: n=100, k=10**

- Sets up [100 - 10 + 1 = 91, 1], so [91,1].

- At stall 1 (91), buys 100 // 91 = 1 jewel, spends 91 coins, remaining 9 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 9 // 1 = 9 jewels, spends 9 coins.

- Total jewels = 1 + 9 = 10 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 13: n=10, k=1**

- Sets up [10 - 1 + 1 = 10, 1], so [10,1].

- At stall 1 (10), buys 10 // 10 = 1 jewel, spends 10 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels = 1 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 14: n=5, k=1**

- Sets up [5 - 1 + 1 = 5, 1], so [5,1].

- At stall 1 (5), buys 5 // 5 = 1 jewel, spends 5 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels = 1 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 15: n=5, k=4**

- Sets up [5 - 4 + 1 = 2, 1], so [2,1].

- At stall 1 (2), buys 5 // 2 = 2 jewels, spends 4 coins, remaining 1 coin.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin.

- Total jewels = 2 + 1 = 3 < 4, so 'NO'.

Is there a way to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 5 coins?

- If Bob sets up one stall with price 1, Alice buys 5 jewels, which is more than 4.

- If he sets up [2,1], as above, total jewels = 3 < 4.

- If he sets up [1.25,1], but prices must be integers, so 2 and 1 is the closest.

- So, seems impossible, hence 'NO' is correct.

All these cases seem to suggest that the program's logic is correct.

But I need to think about more complex cases, especially where k is large relative to n, or where n is much larger than k.

**Case 16: n=100, k=50**

- Sets up [100 - 50 + 1 = 51, 1], so [51,1].

- At stall 1 (51), buys 100 // 51 = 1 jewel, spends 51 coins, remaining 49 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 49 // 1 = 49 jewels, spends 49 coins.

- Total jewels = 1 + 49 = 50 == k, so 'YES'.

**Case 17: n=100, k=60**

- Sets up [100 - 60 + 1 = 41, 1], so [41,1].

- At stall 1 (41), buys 100 // 41 = 2 jewels, spends 82 coins, remaining 18 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 18 // 1 = 18 jewels, spends 18 coins.

- Total jewels = 2 + 18 = 20 < 60, so 'NO'.

Is there a way to make Alice buy exactly 60 jewels with 100 coins?

- If Bob sets up one stall with price 1, Alice buys 100 jewels, which is more than 60.

- With two stalls [p1, p2]:

- If p1 is 2, buys 100//2 = 50 jewels, spends 100 coins.

- Then p2 is irrelevant, total jewels = 50 < 60.

- If p1 is 1, buys 100 jewels, which is more than 60.

- If p1 is 3, buys 100//3 = 33 jewels, spends 99 coins.

- p2=1, buys 1//1=1 jewel, total jewels=34 <60.

- p2=2, buys 1//2=0 jewels.

- total jewels=33 <60.

- With three stalls:

- p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

- At p1: buys 100//2=50 jewels, spends 100 coins.

- Can't buy from p2 and p3.

- total jewels=50 <60.

- p1=3, p2=2, p3=1.

- At p1: buys 100//3=33 jewels, spends 99 coins.

- At p2: buys 99//2=49.5, but since it's integer division, 49 jewels, spends 98 coins.

- But actually, after p1, remaining coins are 100 - 99 =1 coin.

- At p2 (2), can't buy any jewels with 1 coin.

- At p3 (1), buys 1//1=1 jewel.

- Total jewels=33 +0 +1=34 <60.

- Seems not possible.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

**Case 18: n=100, k=200**

- n < k, so 'NO'.

**Case 19: n=0, k=0**

- n == k, so 'YES', 1 stall with price 1.

- But n=0, coins=0, k=0 jewels.

- Alice has 0 coins, so she can't buy any jewels, which matches k=0.

- So, 'YES'.

But in the program, if n==k, it sets up one stall with price 1.

- If n=0, k=0:

- At stall 1 (1), buys 0//1=0 jewels, spends 0 coins.

- Total jewels=0==k, so 'YES'.

**Case 20: n=0, k=1**

- n < k, so 'NO'.

**Case 21: n=5, k=0**

- k=0, but n >=0, but Alice has to buy jewels.

- Wait, the problem says Bob wants Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

- If k=0, Bob wants Alice to buy 0 jewels.

- Alice has n coins, but she doesn't need to spend all her coins.

- So, if Bob sets up stalls in such a way that Alice can't buy any jewels, then h=0.

- For example, set up a stall with price > n.

- For k=0, perhaps setting up a stall with price > n would make Alice buy 0 jewels.

- But according to the program, if k=0 and n >=0, it should be 'YES'.

- But the program doesn't handle k=0 case explicitly.

Wait, looking back at the program:

def func_1(n, k):

if n == k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(1)

return

if n < k:

print('NO')

return

costs = [n - k + 1, 1]

h = 0

for i in costs:

curr = n // i

h += curr

n -= i * curr

if h < k:

print('NO')

else:

print(2)

print('YES')

print(*costs)

But in the problem description, k is a positive integer.

Looking back:

"Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end."

So k is at least 1, so k=0 is not possible.

Hence, no need to worry about k=0.

**Case 22: n=10^{18}, k=1**

- Sets up [10^{18} - 1 +1 = 10^{18},1], so [10^{18},1].

- At stall 1 (10^{18}), buys 10^{18} // 10^{18} =1 jewel, spends 10^{18} coins, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels=1==k, so 'YES'.

**Case 23: n=10^{18}, k=10^{18}**

- n == k, so sets up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 10^{18} //1 =10^{18} jewels, which matches k, so 'YES'.

**Case 24: n=10^{18}, k=5*10^{17}**

- Sets up [10^{18} - 5*10^{17} +1 = 5*10^{17} +1,1], so [5*10^{17} +1,1].

- At stall 1 (5*10^{17} +1), buys 10^{18} // (5*10^{17} +1) = floor(10^{18} / (5*10^{17} +1)) = floor(2 - a small fraction) =1 jewel, spends (5*10^{17} +1) coins, remaining 10^{18} - (5*10^{17} +1) = 5*10^{17} -1 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys (5*10^{17} -1) //1 =5*10^{17} -1 jewels, spends 5*10^{17} -1 coins.

- Total jewels=1 + (5*10^{17} -1) =5*10^{17} < k=5*10^{17}, which is less than k.

- Wait, 1 + (5*10^{17} -1) =5*10^{17}, which is equal to k.

- So h=5*10^{17} ==k, so 'YES'.

But according to the program, it would check if h <k, which is not the case here, so it should print 'YES'.

Wait, but in the program, it checks if h <k, and if not, prints 'YES'.

But in this case, h=5*10^{17} ==k, so it should print 'YES'.

But according to the program, it sets up two stalls with [n -k +1,1], and then calculates h.

Let me recast the calculation:

n=10^{18}, k=5*10^{17}

costs=[10^{18} -5*10^{17} +1,1]=[5*10^{17} +1,1]

At stall 1: buys floor(10^{18} / (5*10^{17} +1)) = floor(2 - a small fraction)=1 jewel, spends 5*10^{17} +1 coins.

Remaining coins:10^{18} - (5*10^{17} +1)=5*10^{17} -1 coins.

At stall 2: buys floor((5*10^{17} -1)/1)=5*10^{17} -1 jewels, spends 5*10^{17} -1 coins.

Total jewels:1 + (5*10^{17} -1)=5*10^{17}, which equals k.

Hence, h=5*10^{17} ==k, so 'YES'.

But in the program, it seems to check if h <k, and if not, prints 'YES'.

But in this case, h==k, which is not less than k, so it should print 'YES'.

Seems correct.

**Case 25: n=10^{18}, k=10^{18} +1**

- n <k, so 'NO'.

Wait, n=10^{18}, k=10^{18} +1.

But n >=k is not possible since n >=k only if n >=k, but here n <k, so 'NO'.

Wait, n=10^{18}, k=10^{18} +1.

But n <k, so 'NO'.

Wait, n cannot be less than k in this scenario, but according to the problem, n and k are positive integers up to 10^{18}, so n can be less than k.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

**Case 26: n=10^{18}, k=2*10^{18}**

- n <k, so 'NO'.

**Case 27: n=10^{18}, k=10^{18} -1**

- n -k +1=10^{18} - (10^{18} -1) +1=10^{18} -10^{18} +1 +1=2.

- So, costs=[2,1].

- At stall 1 (2), buys floor(10^{18}/2)=5*10^{17} jewels, spends 10^{18} - (10^{18} mod 2)=10^{18} -0=10^{18} coins.

- Remaining coins:0.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels=5*10^{17} < k=10^{18} -1, which is true since 5*10^{17} <10^{18} -1.

- Hence, 'NO'.

But is there a way to make Alice buy exactly k=10^{18} -1 jewels with n=10^{18} coins?

Let's think:

- If Bob sets up one stall with price 1, Alice buys 10^{18} jewels, which is more than k.

- If he sets up two stalls: [p1, p2].

- For example, [ceil(n /k),1].

- Wait, perhaps [ceil(n /k),1] would be a better approach.

- ceil(n /k)=ceil(10^{18} / (10^{18} -1))=ceil(1 + 1/(10^{18} -1))=1.

- So, [1,1], which would make Alice buy 10^{18} jewels, which is more than k.

- Alternatively, set p1=10^{18} /k, but k=10^{18} -1, so p1=10^{18} / (10^{18} -1)=1.

- So, p1=1, p2=1.

- Same issue.

- Maybe set p1=n -k +1=10^{18} - (10^{18} -1) +1=2.

- So, [2,1].

- As in the program.

- Then, h=5*10^{17} <k=10^{18} -1, so 'NO'.

- Is there any other way?

- Perhaps with more stalls.

- But the program only sets up two stalls.

- The problem allows up to 60 stalls.

- Maybe with more stalls, it's possible.

- For example, set p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, ..., p60=1.

- At p1=2, buys floor(10^{18}/2)=5*10^{17} jewels, spends 10^{18} - (10^{18} mod 2)=10^{18} -0=10^{18} coins.

- Remaining coins:0.

- Total jewels:5*10^{17} <k=10^{18} -1.

- Still not enough.

- Alternatively, set p1=higher values to reduce the number of jewels bought at each stall.

- But it seems impossible to make Alice buy exactly k=10^{18} -1 jewels with n=10^{18} coins using any number of stalls up to 60.

- Hence, 'NO' is correct.

So, the program seems to handle this case correctly.

**Case 28: n=100, k=5**

- Sets up [100 -5 +1=96,1], so [96,1].

- At stall 1 (96), buys 100//96=1 jewel, spends 96 coins, remaining 4 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 4//1=4 jewels, spends 4 coins.

- Total jewels=1+4=5==k, so 'YES'.

**Case 29: n=100, k=6**

- Sets up [100 -6 +1=95,1], so [95,1].

- At stall 1 (95), buys 100//95=1 jewel, spends 95 coins, remaining 5 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 5//1=5 jewels, spends 5 coins.

- Total jewels=1+5=6==k, so 'YES'.

**Case 30: n=100, k=7**

- Sets up [100 -7 +1=94,1], so [94,1].

- At stall 1 (94), buys 100//94=1 jewel, spends 94 coins, remaining 6 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 6//1=6 jewels, spends 6 coins.

- Total jewels=1+6=7==k, so 'YES'.

**Case 31: n=100, k=101**

- n <k, so 'NO'.

**Case 32: n=1, k=1**

- Already covered.

**Case 33: n=2, k=1**

- Already covered.

**Case 34: n=10^{18}, k=10^{18}**

- Already covered.

**Case 35: n=10^{18}, k=1**

- Already covered.

**Case 36: n=1, k=2**

- Already covered.

**Case 37: n=5, k=3**

- Already covered.

**Case 38: n=10, k=5**

- Already covered.

**Case 39: n=255, k=8**

- As in the example, program sets up [255 -8 +1=248,1], so [248,1].

- At stall 1 (248), buys 255//248=1 jewel, spends 248 coins, remaining 7 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 7//1=7 jewels, spends 7 coins.

- Total jewels=1+7=8==k, so 'YES'.

But in the example output, it shows 'YES', 10, and prices from 2 to 11.

So, multiple solutions are possible, but the program chooses [248,1], which also works.

Hence, it's acceptable.

**Case 40: n=10, k=4**

- Already covered.

**Case 41: n=10, k=3**

- Already covered.

**Case 42: n=7, k=3**

- As in the first example, program sets up [7-3+1=5,1], so [5,1].

- At stall 1 (5), buys 7//5=1 jewel, spends 5 coins, remaining 2 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 2//1=2 jewels, spends 2 coins.

- Total jewels=1+2=3==k, so 'YES'.

Again, the example output shows 'YES', 10, and prices from 2 to 11, but the program's solution with [5,1] also works.

Hence, it's acceptable.

So, from all these test cases, it seems like the program's logic is correct.

But I need to think about potential edge cases where the program might fail.

**Edge Case 1: n=1, k=1**

- Covered, works correctly.

**Edge Case 2: n=1, k=2**

- Covered, 'NO'.

**Edge Case 3: n=2, k=1**

- Covered, 'YES'.

**Edge Case 4: n=2, k=2**

- Covered, 'YES'.

**Edge Case 5: n=10^{18}, k=1**

- Covered, 'YES'.

**Edge Case 6: n=10^{18}, k=10^{18}**

- Covered, 'YES'.

**Edge Case 7: n=10^{18}, k=10^{18} +1**

- Covered, 'NO'.

**Edge Case 8: n=5, k=5**

- Sets up [5-5+1=1,1], so [1,1].

- At stall 1 (1), buys 5//1=5 jewels, spends 5 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels=5==k, so 'YES'.

**Edge Case 9: n=3, k=2**

- Sets up [3-2+1=2,1], so [2,1].

- At stall 1 (2), buys 3//2=1 jewel, spends 2 coins, remaining 1 coin.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 1//1=1 jewel, spends 1 coin.

- Total jewels=1+1=2==k, so 'YES'.

**Edge Case 10: n=4, k=3**

- Sets up [4-3+1=2,1], so [2,1].

- At stall 1 (2), buys 4//2=2 jewels, spends 4 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- At stall 2 (1), cannot buy more jewels.

- Total jewels=2 <3, so 'NO'.

Is there a way to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins?

- Set up [1,1]:

- At stall 1 (1), buys 4//1=4 jewels, spends 4 coins.

- Total jewels=4 >3.

- Set up [2,1]:

- At stall 1 (2), buys 4//2=2 jewels, spends 4 coins.

- Total jewels=2 <3.

- Set up [3,1]:

- At stall 1 (3), buys 4//3=1 jewel, spends 3 coins, remaining 1 coin.

- At stall 2 (1), buys 1//1=1 jewel, spends 1 coin.

- Total jewels=1+1=2 <3.

- Set up [1.5,1], but prices must be integers.

- So, seems impossible, hence 'NO' is correct.

All these cases suggest that the program's logic is correct.

But I need to think about whether the program always works.

Looking back at the program:

def func_1(n, k):

if n == k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(1)

return

if n < k:

print('NO')

return

costs = [n - k + 1, 1]

h = 0

for i in costs:

curr = n // i

h += curr

n -= i * curr

if h < k:

print('NO')

else:

print(2)

print('YES')

print(*costs)

Wait, there's a mistake here.

In the else block, it first prints '2', then 'YES', then the prices.

But according to the problem, it should print 'YES', then the number of stalls, then the prices.

So, the order is incorrect.

It should be:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(*costs)

But in the program, it's:

print(2)

print('YES')

print(*costs)

This is incorrect according to the output format specified in the problem description.

Hence, the program is incorrect due to this formatting issue.

Hence, Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program has a flaw in the output format. Specifically, when the answer is "YES", it should first print "YES", followed by the number of stalls, and then the prices of the stalls. However, in the program, it prints the number of stalls first, then "YES", and then the prices. This does not match the required output format as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to this formatting error.

**Example of Incorrect Output:**

For a test case where n=7 and k=3, the program outputs
