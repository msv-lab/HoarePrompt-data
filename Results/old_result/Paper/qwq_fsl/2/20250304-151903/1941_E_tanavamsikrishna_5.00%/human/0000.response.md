Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to solve a problem involving building bridges over a river grid, minimizing the cost of installing supports for the bridges. There are constraints on where and how supports can be placed, and the program needs to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. Let's break it down:

- We have a river grid with n rows and m columns.

- Each cell (i,j) has a depth a_{i,j}, and the depths on the first and last columns are always 0, representing the river banks.

- Rudolf wants to build k bridges on consecutive rows, and for each bridge, he needs to install supports according to specific rules:

  - Supports must be installed at both ends of the bridge (columns 1 and m).

  - The distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d.

- The cost of installing a support at cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.

- The goal is to minimize the total cost of supports for building k consecutive bridges.

Given that, the program needs to process multiple test cases, each with different values of n, m, k, d, and the grid of depths, and output the minimal total cost for each test case.

Now, looking at the provided program:

- It reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.

- For each test case, it reads n, m, k, d, and then reads the n rows of depths.

- It seems to compute the cost for each row independently using func_1, stores these costs in a list called costs, and then finds the minimum sum of k consecutive costs in this list.

- Finally, it prints this minimum total cost.

So, the approach seems to be:

1. Calculate the minimal cost for building a bridge on each row independently.

2. Then, find the minimal sum of costs for any k consecutive rows.

This seems logical because the bridges must be built on consecutive rows, and we need the total minimal cost for k such bridges.

Now, I need to verify if this approach is correct and if the implementation matches the problem requirements.

Let's dive deeper into func_1, which calculates the minimal cost for a single row.

def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

return row[-1]

This function seems to be implementing some sort of dynamic programming to calculate the minimal cost for placing supports in a row.

Let's understand what it's doing:

- It iterates through the cells of the row from left to right.

- For the first d-1 cells, it simply adds 1 to the depth (since supports must be placed at the ends, and perhaps at these positions).

- For cells starting from d-1 to the end, it calculates the minimal cost by considering the minimum cost of the previous d cells and adding the cost of placing a support in the current cell.

- Finally, it returns the cost at the last cell, which should represent the minimal cost for the entire row.

Wait a minute, I need to make sure that this correctly models the placement of supports with the given constraints.

Constraints for support placement:

1. Supports must be installed at cell (i,1) and (i,m).

2. The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than d.

Given that, the problem of placing supports can be modeled as placing supports at certain columns, with the constraints on the distances, and the objective is to minimize the total cost.

This seems similar to the classic "jump game" or "minimum jumps" problems, where you have to reach the end with certain constraints on the jumps.

In this case, the "jumps" correspond to the distances between supports, and we need to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of a_{i,j} + 1 for each support placed.

So, perhaps func_1 is implementing a dynamic programming approach to find the minimal cost path from column 1 to column m, with the step size up to d.

Let me think about it in terms of dynamic programming:

- Let dp[j] represent the minimal cost to reach column j from column 1, with supports placed according to the rules.

- Initialization:

  - dp[0] = 0 (since support is mandatory at column 1)

  - dp[1] = a[i,1] + 1 (but a[i,1] is 0, so dp[1] = 1)

- Transition:

  - For each column j from 2 to m:

    - dp[j] = min(dp[k] + a[i,j] + 1) for k in [max(0, j - d), j - 1]

- The final cost is dp[m-1], assuming columns are 0-indexed.

Looking back at func_1, it seems to be attempting this DP approach.

However, there are a few concerns:

1. The first loop: for i in range(0, d - 1):

   row[i] = row[i] + 1

   - This seems to be handling the first d-1 columns. But given that supports must be placed at column 1, and perhaps at these positions if needed, it's unclear why we're adding 1 to these positions.

2. The second loop: for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

   row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

   - This seems to be calculating the DP transition correctly, considering the minimum cost from the previous d columns.

But there's a potential issue here:

- The DP transition should consider the minimal cost from the previous d columns, but the way it's implemented, it's taking the minimum from max(0, i - (d + 1)) to i - 1.

- Wait, i - (d + 1) to i - 1 means considering up to d columns before the current one, which seems correct.

However, I'm a bit uneasy about the indices. Let's consider a small example to verify.

Take the first example from the input:

n=3, m=11, k=1, d=4

Rows:

0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0

0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0

According to the output, the minimal cost is 4, achieved by building the bridge on the second row.

Let's see what func_1 does for the second row: [0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,3,2,0]

Applying func_1 with d=4:

- Initialize dp = [0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,3,2,0]

- For i from 0 to d-2 (0 to 2):

   dp[0] = 0 + 1 = 1

   dp[1] = 1 + 1 = 2

   dp[2] = 2 + 1 = 3

- For i from d-1=3 to len(row)-1=10:

   dp[3] = min(dp[3-5= -1 (so max(0,-1)=0 to 3-1=2]) = min(dp[0], dp[1], dp[2]) = min(1,2,3)=1 + a[3]+1=3+1=4 → dp[3]=5

   dp[4] = min(dp[4-5=-1 → 0 to 4-1=3]) = min(1,2,3,5)=1 + a[4]+1=2+1=3 → dp[4]=4

   dp[5] = min(dp[0 to 5-1=4]) = min(1,2,3,5,4)=1 + a[5]+1=1+1=2 → dp[5]=3

   dp[6] = min(dp[1 to 6-1=5]) = min(2,3,5,4,3)=2 + a[6]+1=2+1=3 → dp[6]=5

   dp[7] = min(dp[2 to 7-1=6]) = min(3,5,4,3,5)=3 + a[7]+1=3+1=4 → dp[7]=7

   dp[8] = min(dp[3 to 8-1=7]) = min(5,4,3,5,7)=3 + a[8]+1=3+1=4 → dp[8]=7

   dp[9] = min(dp[4 to 9-1=8]) = min(4,3,5,7,7)=3 + a[9]+1=2+1=3 → dp[9]=6

   dp[10]= min(dp[5 to 10-1=9]) = min(3,5,7,7,6)=3 + a[10]+1=0+1=1 → dp[10]=4

So, dp[10]=4, which matches the expected output.

Another test case:

n=4, m=4, k=2, d=1

Rows:

0 3 3 0

0 2 1 0

0 1 2 0

0 3 3 0

We need to build 2 consecutive bridges, and find the minimal total cost.

First, compute costs for each row using func_1.

Row 1: [0,3,3,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]= min(dp[0])=1 + 3+1=5

- dp[2]= min(dp[1])=5 + 3+1=9

- dp[3]= min(dp[2])=9 + 0+1=10

Row 2: [0,2,1,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]=1 + 2+1=4

- dp[2]= min(dp[1])=4 + 1+1=6

- dp[3]= min(dp[2])=6 + 0+1=7

Row 3: [0,1,2,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]=1 + 1+1=3

- dp[2]= min(dp[1])=3 + 2+1=6

- dp[3]= min(dp[2])=6 + 0+1=7

Row 4: [0,3,3,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]=1 + 3+1=5

- dp[2]= min(dp[1])=5 + 3+1=9

- dp[3]= min(dp[2])=9 + 0+1=10

Now, total_costs for k=2 consecutive rows:

- Rows 1-2: 10 + 7 = 17

- Rows 2-3: 7 + 7 = 14

- Rows 3-4: 7 + 10 = 17

The minimal total cost is 14, but according to the sample output, it's 8. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output. Let's check the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

5

3 11 1 4

0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0

0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0

4 4 2 1

0 3 3 0

0 2 1 0

0 1 2 0

0 3 3 0

4 5 2 5

0 1 1 1 0

0 2 2 2 0

0 0 2 1 1 0

0 3 2 1 0

1 8 1 1

0 10 4 8 4 4 2 0

4 5 3 2

0 8 4 4 0

0 3 4 8 0

0 8 1 10 0

0 10 1 5 0

Sample Output:

4

8

4

15

14

Wait, in the second test case, according to the sample output, it's 8, but according to my calculation above, it's 14. That suggests that either my understanding is wrong or the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the rows. Let's look back at the second test case input:

4 4 2 1

0 3 3 0

0 2 1 0

0 1 2 0

0 3 3 0

So, n=4, m=4, k=2, d=1

Rows:

[0,3,3,0]

[0,2,1,0]

[0,1,2,0]

[0,3,3,0]

Now, applying func_1 to each row:

Row 1: [0,3,3,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]=1 + 3+1=5

- dp[2]= min(dp[1])=5 + 3+1=9

- dp[3]= min(dp[2])=9 + 0+1=10

Row 2: [0,2,1,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]=1 + 2+1=4

- dp[2]= min(dp[1])=4 + 1+1=6

- dp[3]= min(dp[2])=6 + 0+1=7

Row 3: [0,1,2,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]=1 + 1+1=3

- dp[2]= min(dp[1])=3 + 2+1=6

- dp[3]= min(dp[2])=6 + 0+1=7

Row 4: [0,3,3,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]=1 + 3+1=5

- dp[2]= min(dp[1])=5 + 3+1=9

- dp[3]= min(dp[2])=9 + 0+1=10

Total costs for k=2 consecutive rows:

- Rows 1-2: 10 + 7 = 17

- Rows 2-3: 7 + 7 = 14

- Rows 3-4: 7 + 10 = 17

Minimal total cost is 14, but according to the sample output, it's 8. So there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let's double-check the DP for row 2:

Row 2: [0,2,1,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]= min(dp[0])=1 + 2+1=4

- dp[2]= min(dp[1])=4 + 1+1=6

- dp[3]= min(dp[2])=6 + 0+1=7

Seems correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that d=1, meaning the distance between supports must be no more than 1, which implies that supports must be placed in every column.

Wait, distance between adjacent supports must be no more than d, where distance is |j1 - j2| - 1.

So, if d=1, then |j1 - j2| -1 <=1 => |j1 - j2| <=2.

Wait, |j1 - j2| -1 <= d => |j1 - j2| <= d+1.

So, for d=1, |j1 - j2| <=2.

Wait, but in the DP, we're considering supports up to d columns away.

Wait, perhaps I need to revisit the DP implementation.

Looking back at func_1:

def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):

for i in range(0, d - 1):

row[i] = row[i] + 1

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

return row[-1]

Wait, in the second loop, it's taking the minimum from max(0, i - (d + 1)) to i -1.

But according to the earlier analysis, for d=1, supports must be no more than 1 unit apart.

Wait, distance between supports is |j1 - j2| -1 <= d.

So, |j1 - j2| <= d +1.

Hence, for d=1, supports can be up to 2 columns apart.

Therefore, in the DP, when d=1, we should consider supports from the previous 2 columns.

But in the code, for d=1, the first loop runs for i from 0 to d-2, which is i from 0 to -1, so it doesn't run.

Then, for i from d-1=0 to len(row)-1:

row[i] = min(row[max(0, i - (d +1)) : i]) + row[i] +1

For d=1, i - (d +1) = i -2.

So, for i from 0 to len(row)-1:

- i=0: min(row[max(0,0-2):0]) = min(row[0:0]) which is no elements → should raise an error, but in Python, min() with no args raises ValueError. But in the code, there's a condition: if i > 0 else 0. Wait, but max(0, i-2) could be less than 0.

Wait, let's see:

for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

So, for d=1:

for i in range(0, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - 2):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

So, for i=0:

row[0] = 0 + row[0] +1 = 1 (since max(0,0-2)=0, but range(0:0) is empty → else 0)

i=1:

row[1] = min(row[0:1]) = min([1])=1 + row[1]+1=1+2+1=4 → row[1]=4

i=2:

row[2] = min(row[0:2])=min(1,4)=1 + row[2]+1=1+1+1=3 → row[2]=4

i=3:

row[3] = min(row[1:3])=min(4,4)=4 + row[3]+1=0+1=1 → row[3]=5

So, total cost for row 2 would be 5, not 7 as I previously calculated.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 7, but according to this, it's 5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, but according to this, row[3]=5, but according to the sample output, the minimal total cost for this test case is 8, which would be 5 +3=8 for rows 2 and 3.

Wait, row 3:

[0,1,2,0]

i=0: row[0]=0 +0+1=1

i=1: min(row[-1:1]) → row[0:1]=1 → 1 +1+1=3

i=2: min(row[0:2])=min(1,3)=1 +2+1=4

i=3: min(row[1:3])=min(3,4)=3 +0+1=4

So, row 3 cost is 4.

Total for rows 2 and 3: 5 +4=9, which is still not matching the sample output of 8.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the minimal total cost is achieved by choosing rows 2 and 3, but with different calculations.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for d=1, supports can be placed every 2 columns.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink the DP approach.

Alternatively, maybe the DP implementation is incorrect.

Let me try to think of a different approach to model this problem.

An alternative way is to model this as a shortest path problem, where each column is a node, and edges represent the possibility of placing supports.

But perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Let me think about the constraints again.

Given that supports must be placed at both ends (columns 1 and m), and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than d.

Given that, the positions of supports can be modeled as a sequence where the distance between consecutive supports is at most d.

Hence, for each row, we need to find the minimal cost of placing supports at positions where the distance between any two consecutive supports is at most d, including the mandatory supports at positions 1 and m.

This sounds like a classic dynamic programming problem where dp[j] represents the minimal cost to reach column j from column 1, placing supports according to the rules.

The transition would be:

dp[j] = min(dp[i] + cost[j]) for all i such that j - i <= d +1

Where cost[j] = a[i,j] +1 if a support is placed at j, else 0.

Wait, but in the code, it's adding a[i,j] +1 regardless.

Wait, no, the cost is only incurred when a support is placed at j.

Hence, the DP should account for whether a support is placed at j or not.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the DP approach.

Let me define dp[j] as the minimal cost to reach column j with a support placed at j.

Then, for each j from 2 to m:

dp[j] = min(dp[k] + a[i,j] +1) for k in [max(1, j - d -1), j -1]

Wait, but the distance between k and j is |j - k| -1 <=d.

Hence, |j - k| -1 <=d ⇒ |j - k| <=d+1 ⇒ k ∈ [j - (d+1), j -1]

Hence, dp[j] = min(dp[k] for k in [max(1, j - d -1), j -1]) + a[i,j] +1

But in the code, it's:

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1

Assuming row[i] corresponds to dp[j], and i is j.

But in Python, list indices start from 0, so it's okay.

But in the earlier calculation, for the second test case, I got dp[3]=5 for row 2, but according to the sample output, the total minimal cost is 8 for building bridges on rows 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that k consecutive rows mean that for each set of k consecutive rows, I need to sum the individual minimal costs and find the minimal such sum.

Given that, in the second test case, the minimal total cost is 8, which could be achieved by building bridges on rows 2 and 3 with costs 4 and 4 respectively.

But according to my earlier calculation, row 2 has cost 5 and row 3 has cost 4, totaling 9, which doesn't match the sample output of 8.

Hence, there must be an error in the DP implementation.

Alternatively, perhaps the DP implementation is incorrect.

Let me try to think of another way to implement the DP for a single row.

Define dp[j] as the minimal cost to reach column j with a support at j.

Then, dp[1] = a[i,1] +1 =1

For j from 2 to m:

dp[j] = min(dp[k] for k in range(max(1, j - d -1), j)) + a[i,j] +1

But in the code, it's:

for i in range(0, d -1):

row[i] = row[i] +1

for i in range(d-1, len(row)):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d +1)):i]) if i >0 else 0) + row[i] +1

return row[-1]

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me consider that columns are 1 to m, and in the code, i corresponds to column index starting from 0.

Hence, row[0] corresponds to column 1.

Wait, but in the problem, columns are from 1 to m, but in the code, list indices start from 0.

Wait, looking back at the code:

rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]

This reads m columns for each of the n rows.

Assuming that the columns are indexed from 0 to m-1.

Hence, column 1 is index 0, column m is index m-1.

Hence, the DP should be adjusted accordingly.

Let me try to recast the DP with 0-based indexing.

Define dp[j] as the minimal cost to reach column j with a support at j.

dp[0] = a[i,0] +1 =1

for j from 1 to m-1:

dp[j] = min(dp[k] for k in range(max(0, j - (d +1)), j)) + a[i,j] +1

Hence, in the code:

for i in range(d -1):

row[i] = row[i] +1

for i in range(d -1, m):

row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d +1)):i]) if i >0 else 0) + row[i] +1

return row[-1]

Wait, for d=1, and m=4:

for i in range(0):

# no iteration

for i in range(0,4):

row[0]: min(row[max(0,0-2):0]) if i>0 else 0 + row[0]+1 = 0 +0+1=1

row[1]: min(row[0:1])=1 +2+1=4

row[2]: min(row[0:2])=1 +1+1=3

row[3]: min(row[1:3])=min(4,3)=3 +0+1=4

Hence, total cost for row 2:4

Row 3:

row[0]=0+1=1

row[1]= min(row[0:1])=1 +1+1=3

row[2]= min(row[0:2])=1 +2+1=4

row[3]= min(row[1:3])=min(3,4)=3 +0+1=4

Total for rows 2 and 3:4+4=8, which matches the sample output.

Wait, earlier I had a mistake in calculating row 2's cost; it should be 4, not 5.

Hence, total cost is 8, matching the sample output.

Hence, perhaps the DP implementation is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought row 2's cost was 5, but according to this, it's 4.

Let me recalculate for row 2: [0,2,1,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]= min(dp[0])=1 +2+1=4

- dp[2]= min(dp[0], dp[1])=1 +1+1=3

- dp[3]= min(dp[1], dp[2])=min(4,3)=3 +0+1=4

Hence, dp[3]=4

Similarly, row 3: [0,1,2,0]

- dp[0]=1

- dp[1]= min(dp[0])=1 +1+1=3

- dp[2]= min(dp[0], dp[1])=1 +2+1=4

- dp[3]= min(dp[1], dp[2])=min(3,4)=3 +0+1=4

Hence, total cost for rows 2 and 3:4+4=8, which matches the sample output.

Hence, the DP implementation seems correct.

Earlier, I had a miscalculation; hence, the program seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs.

Let me check another sample input.

Third test case:

4 5 2 5

0 1 1 1 0

0 2 2 2 0

0 0 2 1 1 0

0 3 2 1 0

According to the sample output, the minimal total cost is 4.

Applying the DP to each row:

Row 1: [0,1,1,1,0]

d=5, m=5

for i in range(4):

row[i]=row[i]+1

row[0]=1

row[1]=2

row[2]=2

row[3]=2

row[4]= min(row[-1:4])=min(row[0:4])=min(1,2,2,2)=1 +0+1=2

Hence, cost for row1:2

Row 2: [0,2,2,2,0]

similarly:

row[0]=1

row[1]=1 +2+1=4

row[2]= min(row[0:2])=1 +2+1=4

row[3]= min(row[0:3])=1 +2+1=4

row[4]= min(row[0:4])=1 +0+1=2

Hence, cost for row2:2

Row3: [0,0,2,1,1,0] Wait, m=5, so row should have 5 elements. There seems to be a typo in the input.

Wait, in the input:

4 5 2 5

0 1 1 1 0

0 2 2 2 0

0 0 2 1 1 0

0 3 2 1 0

It seems like there's an extra 0 in row 3. Probably a typo, should be [0,0,2,1,1]

Assuming that, let's proceed.

Row3: [0,0,2,1,1]

row[0]=1

row[1]= min(row[0:1])=1 +0+1=2

row[2]= min(row[0:2])=1 +2+1=4

row[3]= min(row[0:3])=1 +1+1=3

row[4]= min(row[0:4])=1 +1+1=3

Hence, cost for row3:3

Row4: [0,3,2,1,0]

row[0]=1

row[1]= min(row[0:1])=1 +3+1=5

row[2]= min(row[0:2])=1 +2+1=4

row[3]= min(row[0:3])=1 +1+1=3

row[4]= min(row[0:4])=1 +0+1=2

Hence, cost for row4:2

Now, total costs for k=2 consecutive rows:

- Rows1-2:2+2=4

- Rows2-3:2+3=5

- Rows3-4:3+2=5

Hence, minimal total cost is 4, matching the sample output.

Hence, the program seems to be working correctly for this test case as well.

Another test case:

1 8 1 1

0 10 4 8 4 4 2 0

n=1, m=8, k=1, d=1

Only one row: [0,10,4,8,4,4,2,0]

Applying func_1 with d=1:

for i in range(0):

# no iteration

for i in range(0,8):

row[0]=0 +1=1

row[1]= min(row[-1:1]) → row[0:1]=1 +10+1=12

row[2]= min(row[0:2])=1 +4+1=6

row[3]= min(row[1:3])=min(12,6)=6 +8+1=15

row[4]= min(row[2:4])=min(6,15)=6 +4+1=11

row[5]= min(row[3:5])=min(15,11)=11 +4+1=16

row[6]= min(row[4:6])=min(11,16)=11 +2+1=14

row[7]= min(row[5:7])=min(16,14)=14 +0+1=15

Hence, cost is 15, but according to the sample output, it's 15, which matches.

Wait, but according to the sample output, for this test case, it's 15, but in the explanation, it's 14. Wait, no, the sample output is:

4

8

4

15

14

So, for this test case, it's 15, which matches the program's output.

The last test case:

4 5 3 2

0 8 4 4 0

0 3 4 8 0

0 8 1 10 0

0 10 1 5 0

n=4, m=5, k=3, d=2

Compute costs for each row:

Row1: [0,8,4,4,0]

d=2

for i in range(1):

row[0]=1

for i in range(1,5):

row[1]= min(row[-1:1])=row[0:1]=1 +8+1=10

row[2]= min(row[0:2])=1 +4+1=6

row[3]= min(row[1:3])=min(10,6)=6 +4+1=11

row[4]= min(row[2:4])=min(6,11)=6 +0+1=7

Hence, cost for row1:7

Row2: [0,3,4,8,0]

row[0]=1

row[1]= min(row[-1:1])=row[0:1]=1 +3+1=5

row[2]= min(row[0:2])=1 +4+1=6

row[3]= min(row[1:3])=min(5,6)=5 +8+1=14

row[4]= min(row[2:4])=min(6,14)=6 +0+1=7

Hence, cost for row2:7

Row3: [0,8,1,10,0]

row[0]=1

row[1]= min(row[-1:1])=row[0:1]=1 +8+1=10

row[2]= min(row[0:2])=1 +1+1=3

row[3]= min(row[1:3])=min(10,3)=3 +10+1=14

row[4]= min(row[2:4])=min(3,14)=3 +0+1=4

Hence, cost for row3:4

Row4: [0,10,1,5,0]

row[0]=1

row[1]= min(row[-1:1])=row[0:1]=1 +10+1=12

row[2]= min(row[0:2])=1 +1+1=3

row[3]= min(row[1:3])=min(12,3)=3 +5+1=9

row[4]= min(row[2:4])=min(3,9)=3 +0+1=4

Hence, cost for row4:4

Now, total costs for k=3 consecutive rows:

- Rows1-2-3:7+7+4=18

- Rows2-3-4:7+4+4=15

Minimal total cost is 15, which matches the sample output.

Hence, the program seems to be working correctly for all sample inputs.

Given that, it's likely that the program is correct.

However, to ensure completeness, I should consider edge cases and see if the DP implementation handles them properly.

Edge case 1: n=1, m=3, k=1, d=1

Row: [0,1,0]

Applying func_1:

row[0]=1

row[1]= min(row[-1:1])=row[0:1]=1 +1+1=3

row[2]= min(row[1:2])=3 +0+1=4

Hence, cost=4

Is this correct?

Supports must be placed at column 1 and 3, with distance between supports <=1.

So, supports must be placed at columns 1 and 3, and since distance
