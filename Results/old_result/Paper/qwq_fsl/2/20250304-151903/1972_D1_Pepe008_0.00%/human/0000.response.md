Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every potential case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all possible edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the program provided.

### Problem Description

We are given two positive integers `n` and `m`. We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` satisfying:

1. `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`

2. `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`

### Program Code

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

func()
```

### Approach to Verification

1. **Understand the Condition:**
   - The condition is `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - Mathematically, this means `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

2. **Simplify the Condition:**
   - Let's denote `g = gcd(a, b)`. Then `a = g * a1` and `b = g * b1`, where `gcd(a1, b1) = 1`.
   - Substituting, `a + b = g * a1 + g * b1 = g * (a1 + b1)`.
   - The condition becomes `g * (a1 + b1)` is a multiple of `b * g = g * b1`.
   - Simplifying, `(a1 + b1)` must be a multiple of `b1`.

3. **Further Simplification:**
   - Since `a1` and `b1` are coprime, `a1 + b1` being a multiple of `b1` implies `a1` is a multiple of `b1`.
   - But since `gcd(a1, b1) = 1`, the only way `a1` is a multiple of `b1` is if `b1 = 1`.
   - Therefore, `b1 = 1`, which means `b = g`.

4. **Final Condition:**
   - Hence, `b` must be equal to `gcd(a, b)`, which implies that `b` divides `a`, and `b` is the greatest divisor of `a`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - So, `b` must be a divisor of `a`, and specifically, `b` must be the greatest divisor of `a`, which is `b = gcd(a, b)`.

6. **Simpler Interpretation:**
   - This means `b` divides `a`, and `b` is the greatest divisor, which is `b = gcd(a, b)`.
   - Essentially, `b` divides `a`, and there is no larger divisor.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The provided program seems to have a different approach. It iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` and calculates some expression involving `a` and `i`. Specifically:

- For each `i` from 1 to `b`:

  - Compute `x = (a - i*(i-1)) // (i**2) + 1`

  - If `a - i*(i-1) > 0`, add `x` to `suma`

- Finally, print `suma - 1`

This seems opaque without clear reasoning. I need to verify if this logic correctly counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as per the problem's condition.

### Verification Steps

1. **Check the Condition Directly:**
   - A straightforward but inefficient way is to iterate over all `a` from 1 to `n` and all `b` from 1 to `m`, and check if `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.
   - However, this is too slow for large `n` and `m`, especially since `n` and `m` can be up to 2*10^6 and the sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases can be up to 2*10^6.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - From the earlier analysis, the condition simplifies to `b` divides `a`, and `b` is the greatest divisor, meaning `b` is the gcd of `a` and `b`.
   - Given that, for each `b`, we need to count the number of `a` such that `b` divides `a` and `b` is the gcd.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - For each `b`, we can iterate over multiples of `b` up to `n`, and ensure that `gcd(a, b) = b`.
   - However, this can be optimized further by recognizing that `gcd(a, b) = b` implies that `b` divides `a`, and `a/b` is coprime with `b`.

4. **Euler's Totient Function:**
   - The number of `a` such that `a` is a multiple of `b` and `gcd(a/b, b) = 1` is given by Euler's Totient Function φ(b).
   - Therefore, for each `b`, the number of valid `a` is φ(b).

5. **Summing Up:**
   - Sum φ(b) for all `b` from 1 to `m`, but only considering `a` up to `n`.

### Comparison with Provided Program

The provided program seems to use a different formula:

- For each `i` from 1 to `b`:

  - Compute `x = (a - i*(i-1)) // (i**2) + 1`

  - If `a - i*(i-1) > 0`, add `x` to `suma`

- Finally, print `suma - 1`

This doesn't align with the approach using Euler's Totient Function. I need to verify if this logic is equivalent.

### Testing with Sample Inputs

Let's test the program with the sample inputs provided in the problem description.

**Sample Input 1:**

```

1

1 1

```

**Expected Output:**

```

1

```

**Program's Output:**

Let's simulate the program:

- T = 1

- a = 1, b = 1

- suma = 0

- For i=1:

  - x = (1 - 1*0) // 1 + 1 = 1 // 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

  - Since 1 - 0 > 0, suma += 2 => suma = 2

- Print suma - 1 = 1

- Correct.

**Sample Input 2:**

```

2

2 3

3 5

```

**Expected Output:**

```

3

4

```

**Program's Output:**

Let's simulate for t=1:

- a=2, b=3

- suma=0

- i=1:

  - x=(2-1*0)//1 +1 = 2//1 +1 = 2+1=3

  - 2-0>0, suma+=3 => suma=3

- i=2:

  - x=(2-2*1)//4 +1 = (2-2)//4 +1 = 0//4 +1 = 0 +1 =1

  - 2-2=0 >0 False, do not add

- i=3:

  - x=(2-3*2)//9 +1 = (2-6)//9 +1 = (-4)//9 +1 = -1 +1 =0

  - 2-6=-4 >0 False, do not add

- Print suma -1 =3-1=2

- But expected is 3, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, the program seems to have a discrepancy here. According to the sample input, for t=1, output should be 3, but according to the program, it's printing 2.

This suggests a potential error in the program's logic.

However, perhaps I need to check further.

Let's check t=2:

- a=3, b=5

- suma=0

- i=1:

  - x=(3-1*0)//1 +1 =3//1 +1=3+1=4

  - 3-0>0, suma+=4 => suma=4

- i=2:

  - x=(3-2*1)//4 +1=(3-2)//4 +1=1//4 +1=0 +1=1

  - 3-2=1>0, suma+=1 => suma=5

- i=3:

  - x=(3-3*2)//9 +1=(3-6)//9 +1=(-3)//9 +1=-1 +1=0

  - 3-6=-3>0 False, do not add

- i=4:

  - x=(3-4*3)//16 +1=(3-12)//16 +1=(-9)//16 +1=-1 +1=0

  - 3-12=-9>0 False, do not add

- i=5:

  - x=(3-5*4)//25 +1=(3-20)//25 +1=(-17)//25 +1=-1 +1=0

  - 3-20=-17>0 False, do not add

- Print suma -1=5-1=4

- Which matches the sample output.

Wait, but for t=1, it outputs 2, but the sample output is 3.

This suggests that the program is incorrect for at least one test case.

However, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the simulation.

Looking back at the program:

- It's printing "suma -1", which in the first test case is 1-1=0, but the sample output is 1.

Wait, in the first test case, T=1, with a=1, b=1, and output=1.

In my simulation, suma=2, print 2-1=1, which matches.

But in the second test case, T=2, with a=2, b=3 and a=3, b=5, outputs 2 and 4, but the sample output shows 3 and 4.

Wait, the sample input shows 6 test cases:

6

1 1

2 3

3 5

10 8

100 1233

1000000 1145141

Output:

1

3

4

14

153

1643498

But in my simulation for t=1 (a=2, b=3), the program outputs 2, but the sample output shows 3 for this case.

This indicates a discrepancy, meaning the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Since the program does not produce the correct output for at least one test case, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
