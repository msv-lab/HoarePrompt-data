Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, swapping them, and concatenating them back together.

First, I need to make sure I fully understand the problem. The problem states that we have an array `a` of length `n`, consisting of positive integers. We can perform an operation where we split the array into two parts: a prefix `x` and a suffix `y`, such that `a = x + y`, and then swap these two parts to get `a := y + x`. We can perform this operation any number of times, including zero times, and we need to check if the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order after these operations.

The sample input and output provided help illustrate what's expected:

- For the first test case:

```

6

1 1 4 5 1 4

```

The output is "No", meaning it's not possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the allowed operations.

- For the second test case:

```

5

7 9 2 2 3

```

The output is "Yes", and an example sequence of operations is provided to achieve a sorted array.

- For the third test case:

```

3

1 2 3

```

The output is "Yes", as the array is already sorted.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```python

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])

        if check_all:

            print('YES')

        else:

            for i in range(1, n):

                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:

                    new = a[i:]

                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])

                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])

                    if check_all_new and new_all:

                        print('YES')

                        break

                    else:

                        print('NO')

                        break

```

I need to verify if this program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Read the number of test cases `t`**.

2. **For each test case**:

   a. Read the length of the array `n`.

   b. Read the array `a` as a list of integers.

   c. Check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all`.

      - If `check_all` is `True`, print "YES" because no operations are needed.

      - If `check_all` is `False`, proceed to the next step.

3. **If the array is not sorted**:

   a. Iterate through the array from index 1 to n-1.

   b. Find the first position where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.

   c. Split the array into two parts: `new = a[i:]` and `x = a[:i]`.

   d. Check two conditions:

      - `check_all_new`: Ensure that the first element of `x` (which is `a[0]`) is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`.

      - `new_all`: Ensure that `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

   e. If both conditions are satisfied, print "YES".

   f. If not, print "NO".

At first glance, this seems to follow the problem's requirements. However, I need to think carefully about whether this logic covers all possible cases.

Let me consider the sample inputs:

**First test case:**

```

6

1 1 4 5 1 4

```

According to the sample output, it should print "No". Let's see what the program does:

- Check if the array is already sorted: 1 ≤ 1 ≤ 4 ≤ 5 ≥ 1 ≥ 4 → Not sorted.

- Find the first position where `a[i-1] > a[i]`: At i=4 (0-based index 3), where 5 > 1.

- Split into `new = a[4:] = [1, 4]` and `x = a[:4] = [1, 1, 4, 5]`.

- Check `check_all_new`: `a[0] = 1 >= all in new`: 1 >=1 and 1>=4? No, 1 >=4 is False.

- So `check_all_new` is False.

- Therefore, print "NO", which matches the sample output.

**Second test case:**

```

5

7 9 2 2 3

```

Sample output: "Yes"

- Check if sorted: 7 ≤9 ≥2 ≤2 ≤3 → Not sorted.

- Find first i where a[i-1] > a[i]: At i=2 (0-based index 1), 9>2.

- Split into `new = a[2:] = [2,2,3]` and `x = a[:2] = [7,9]`.

- Check `check_all_new`: `a[0] =7 >= all in new`: 7 >=2, 7>=2, 7>=3 → True.

- Check `new_all`: Is `new` sorted? 2 ≤2 ≤3 → Yes.

- Therefore, print "YES", matching the sample.

**Third test case:**

```

3

1 2 3

```

Already sorted, so `check_all` is True, print "YES".

These match the sample outputs, so the program seems correct for these cases.

But I need to think about whether this logic is universally correct or if there are edge cases where it might fail.

Let's think about what the operation allows us to do. Each operation effectively rotates the prefix to the end. For example, splitting after the first element and swapping changes the array from `x+y` to `y+x`.

In terms of rotations, performing this operation multiple times can simulate multiple rotations.

So, the problem reduces to checking if the array can be made sorted by rotating it any number of times.

However, the provided program doesn't seem to perform multiple rotations or check all possible rotations. It only checks one specific split point where the first violation occurs.

Wait a minute, is that sufficient?

Let me consider an array that requires more than one operation to sort.

Take, for example:

```

4

3 4 1 2

```

This array is not sorted.

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): 4 >1.

Split into `new = a[2:] = [1,2]` and `x = a[:2] = [3,4]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=3 >= all in new`: 3 >=1 and 3>=2 → True.

Check `new_all`: Is `new` sorted? 1 ≤2 → Yes.

So, according to the program, it should print "YES".

But let's see if this array can indeed be sorted with the operations:

- Original: [3,4,1,2]

- Split after first two elements: [3,4] and [1,2] → Swap to [1,2,3,4] → Sorted.

So, in one operation, it's sorted.

Hence, the program correctly identifies it.

Another example:

```

5

2 3 1 4 5

```

Check if sorted: 2 ≤3 ≥1 ≤4 ≤5 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): 3>1.

Split into `new = a[2:] = [1,4,5]` and `x = a[:2] = [2,3]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=2 >= all in new`: 2 >=1, 2>=4? No.

So, `check_all_new` is False → print "NO".

But can this array be sorted with operations?

Let's try:

- Original: [2,3,1,4,5]

- Split after first two: [2,3] + [1,4,5] → Swap to [1,4,5,2,3]

- Now, [1,4,5,2,3]

- Not sorted.

- Try splitting after first three: [1,4,5] + [2,3] → Swap to [2,3,1,4,5]

- Back to original.

- Split after first one: [2] + [3,1,4,5] → Swap to [3,1,4,5,2]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first four: [2,3,1,4] + [5] → Swap to [5,2,3,1,4]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first five: [2,3,1,4,5] + [] → Swap to [2,3,1,4,5]

- Same as original.

Seems like no sequence of operations can sort this array, so the program correctly identifies it as "NO".

Another test case:

```

4

2 1 3 4

```

Check if sorted: 2 ≥1 ≥3 ≥4 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=1 (0-based index 0): 2>1.

Split into `new = a[1:] = [1,3,4]` and `x = a[:1] = [2]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=2 >= all in new`: 2 >=1, 2>=3? No.

So, print "NO".

But can this be sorted?

- Original: [2,1,3,4]

- Split after first one: [2] + [1,3,4] → Swap to [1,3,4,2]

- Now, [1,3,4,2]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first three: [1,3,4] + [2] → Swap to [2,1,3,4]

- Back to original.

- Split after first two: [1,3] + [4,2] → Invalid split because [1,3] + [4,2] ≠ [2,1,3,4].

Wait, the split must be prefix and suffix such that a = x + y.

In this case, only splits like [2] + [1,3,4], [2,1] + [3,4], [2,1,3] + [4], [2,1,3,4] + [] are valid.

- For [2,1] + [3,4]: Swap to [3,4,2,1]

- Not sorted.

- [2,1,3] + [4]: Swap to [4,2,1,3]

- Not sorted.

- [2,1,3,4] + []: Swap to [2,1,3,4]

- Not sorted.

Hence, cannot be sorted, correctly identified as "NO".

Now, let's consider an array that requires multiple operations to sort.

Take:

```

5

3 1 2 4 5

```

Check if sorted: 3 ≥1 ≥2 ≥4 ≥5 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=1 (0-based index 0): 3>1.

Split into `new = a[1:] = [1,2,4,5]` and `x = a[:1] = [3]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=3 >= all in new`: 3 >=1, 3>=2, 3>=4? No.

So, print "NO".

But can this be sorted with operations?

- Original: [3,1,2,4,5]

- Split after first one: [3] + [1,2,4,5] → Swap to [1,2,4,5,3]

- Now, [1,2,4,5,3]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first four: [1,2,4,5] + [3] → Swap to [3,1,2,4,5]

- Back to original.

- Split after first two: [1,2] + [4,5,3] → Swap to [4,5,3,1,2]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first three: [1,2,4] + [5,3] → Swap to [5,3,1,2,4]

- Not sorted.

Seems like cannot be sorted, so "NO" is correct.

Another test case:

```

4

1 3 2 4

```

Check if sorted: 1 ≤3 ≥2 ≤4 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): 3>2.

Split into `new = a[2:] = [2,4]` and `x = a[:2] = [1,3]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=1 >= all in new`: 1 >=2? No.

So, print "NO".

But can this be sorted?

- Original: [1,3,2,4]

- Split after first two: [1,3] + [2,4] → Swap to [2,4,1,3]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first one: [1] + [3,2,4] → Swap to [3,2,4,1]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first three: [1,3,2] + [4] → Swap to [4,1,3,2]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first four: [1,3,2,4] + [] → Swap to [1,3,2,4]

- Not sorted.

Hence, cannot be sorted, "NO" is correct.

Wait, but according to the program's logic, it checks only the first split where a[i-1] > a[i], and the conditions for `check_all_new` and `new_all`. It doesn't consider multiple operations.

But in the examples provided, multiple operations were used to sort the array. However, in the program, it seems to check only one split.

Is it possible that one split is sufficient, and multiple splits are not needed?

Wait, perhaps performing this operation multiple times is equivalent to rotating the array multiple times, which is the same as a single rotation by that amount.

But actually, this operation is not exactly a single rotation, but a swap of prefix and suffix.

Wait, in standard rotation, you shift elements by k positions to the left or right.

Here, the operation is splitting into prefix and suffix and swapping them.

For example, splitting after the first k elements and swapping prefix and suffix.

This is similar to a particular type of rotation.

In fact, it's equivalent to reversing the order of prefix and suffix.

But in the problem, it's specified as swapping the prefix and suffix.

Wait, in the first example:

Original: [3,1,4,5,1,4]

Split into x=[3,1], y=[4,5,1,4], swap to y+x=[4,5,1,4,3,1]

Then, split into x=[4], y=[5,1,4,3,1], swap to y+x=[5,1,4,3,1,4]

Not sorted.

Another operation: split into x=[5], y=[1,4,3,1,4], swap to [1,4,3,1,4,5]

Not sorted.

Another: x=[1,4], y=[3,1,4,5], swap to [3,1,4,5,1,4]

Not sorted.

And so on.

It seems tedious to check all possible sequences of operations.

But in the program, it's checking only one split point and verifying two conditions.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps the program's logic is based on the observation that if there's a single split where the prefix's first element is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix, and the suffix is sorted, then the array can be sorted by swapping that prefix and suffix.

But is this always sufficient?

Let me consider an array where multiple operations are needed.

Take:

```

5

2 3 1 4 5

```

As before, cannot be sorted with one operation, and seems impossible with multiple operations.

Program correctly identifies it as "NO".

Another array:

```

4

1 3 2 4

```

Cannot be sorted with any operations, program correctly identifies as "NO".

Wait, but in the earlier example:

```

5

3 1 2 4 5

```

Program identifies as "NO", which seems correct.

But let's think about an array that might require multiple operations to sort, but the program only checks one split.

Is there any array where performing multiple operations can sort it, but the program's single split check fails?

Let me try to find such a case.

Consider:

```

5

2 4 1 3 5

```

Check if sorted: 2 ≤4 ≥1 ≥3 ≤5 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): 4>1.

Split into `new = a[2:] = [1,3,5]` and `x = a[:2] = [2,4]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=2 >= all in new`: 2 >=1, 2>=3? No.

So, print "NO".

But can this be sorted with operations?

- Original: [2,4,1,3,5]

- Split after first two: [2,4] + [1,3,5] → Swap to [1,3,5,2,4]

- Now, [1,3,5,2,4]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first three: [1,3,5] + [2,4] → Swap to [2,4,1,3,5]

- Back to original.

- Split after first one: [1] + [3,5,2,4] → Swap to [3,5,2,4,1]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first four: [2,4,1,3] + [5] → Swap to [5,2,4,1,3]

- Not sorted.

Seems like cannot be sorted, so "NO" is correct.

Another test case:

```

6

1 3 2 4 5 6

```

Check if sorted: 1 ≤3 ≥2 ≤4 ≤5 ≤6 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): 3>2.

Split into `new = a[2:] = [2,4,5,6]` and `x = a[:2] = [1,3]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=1 >= all in new`: 1 >=2? No.

So, print "NO".

But can this be sorted with operations?

- Original: [1,3,2,4,5,6]

- Split after first two: [1,3] + [2,4,5,6] → Swap to [2,4,5,6,1,3]

- Now, [2,4,5,6,1,3]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first four: [2,4,5,6] + [1,3] → Swap to [1,3,2,4,5,6]

- Back to original.

- Split after first one: [1] + [3,2,4,5,6] → Swap to [3,2,4,5,6,1]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first three: [1,3,2] + [4,5,6] → Swap to [4,5,6,1,3,2]

- Not sorted.

Seems like cannot be sorted, so "NO" is correct.

Wait, but in this case, the array is almost sorted except for one inversion. Is there any array with multiple inversions that can be sorted with multiple operations?

Let me consider an array that is circularly sorted but needs rotation.

Take:

```

4

3 4 1 2

```

As before, can be sorted with one operation, program correctly identifies as "YES".

Another case:

```

5

4 5 1 2 3

```

Check if sorted: 4 ≤5 ≥1 ≤2 ≤3 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): 5>1.

Split into `new = a[2:] = [1,2,3]` and `x = a[:2] = [4,5]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=4 >= all in new`: 4 >=1, 4>=2, 4>=3 → True.

Check `new_all`: Is `new` sorted? 1 ≤2 ≤3 → Yes.

So, print "YES".

Indeed, swapping [4,5] and [1,2,3] gives [1,2,3,4,5], which is sorted.

Correct.

Now, a tricky case:

```

5

1 3 2 4 5

```

Check if sorted: 1 ≤3 ≥2 ≤4 ≤5 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): 3>2.

Split into `new = a[2:] = [2,4,5]` and `x = a[:2] = [1,3]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=1 >= all in new`: 1 >=2? No.

So, print "NO".

But is there a way to sort this with multiple operations?

- Original: [1,3,2,4,5]

- Split after first two: [1,3] + [2,4,5] → Swap to [2,4,5,1,3]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first one: [1] + [3,2,4,5] → Swap to [3,2,4,5,1]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first three: [1,3,2] + [4,5] → Swap to [4,5,1,3,2]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first four: [1,3,2,4] + [5] → Swap to [5,1,3,2,4]

- Not sorted.

Seems like cannot be sorted, so "NO" is correct.

Another test case:

```

6

1 2 3 4 5 6

```

Already sorted, so "YES".

Edge case:

```

2

2 1

```

Check if sorted: 2 ≥1 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=1 (0-based index 0): 2>1.

Split into `new = a[1:] = [1]` and `x = a[:1] = [2]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=2 >= all in new`: 2 >=1 → True.

Check `new_all`: Is `new` sorted? [1] → Yes.

So, print "YES".

Indeed, swapping [2] and [1] gives [1,2], which is sorted.

Correct.

Another edge case:

```

3

1 3 2

```

Check if sorted: 1 ≤3 ≥2 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): 3>2.

Split into `new = a[2:] = [2]` and `x = a[:2] = [1,3]`.

Check `check_all_new`: `a[0]=1 >= all in new`: 1 >=2? No.

So, print "NO".

But can it be sorted with operations?

- Original: [1,3,2]

- Split after first two: [1,3] + [2] → Swap to [2,1,3]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first one: [1] + [3,2] → Swap to [3,2,1]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first three: [1,3,2] + [] → Swap to [1,3,2]

- Not sorted.

Cannot be sorted, so "NO" is correct.

Wait, but in this case, the program checks only the first split where a[i-1] > a[i], which is at i=2.

It checks if a[0] >= all in new and new is sorted.

If not, it prints "NO".

But what if there are multiple positions where a[i-1] > a[i]? Does the program handle that?

Let's see.

In the program, the loop is:

```

for i in range(1, n):

    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:

        new = a[i:]

        check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[j] for j in range(len(new))])

        new_all = all([new[j - 1] <= new[j] for j in range(1, len(new))])

        if check_all_new and new_all:

            print('YES')

            break

        else:

            print('NO')

            break

```

So, it finds the first i where a[i-1] > a[i], checks the conditions for that split, and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly, breaking out of the loop.

Hence, it only checks the first such split.

Is this sufficient?

I need to think if there are cases where the first split doesn't satisfy the conditions, but a later split does, and the array can still be sorted.

Wait, but according to the problem, we can perform the operation any number of times.

So, perhaps performing multiple operations can rearrange the array in a way that a single operation cannot.

But the program only checks one split.

Is the program's logic too restrictive?

Let me consider an array where multiple operations are needed to sort it, but the first split doesn't satisfy the program's conditions.

Take:

```

5

2 3 1 4 5

```

As before, the first split at i=2 (0-based index 1):

- new = [1,4,5]

- a[0]=2 >= all in new: 2 >=1, 2>=4? No.

- So, print "NO".

But perhaps another split could lead to a sorted array after multiple operations.

Let's try:

- Original: [2,3,1,4,5]

- Split after first one: [2] + [3,1,4,5] → Swap to [3,1,4,5,2]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first two: [2,3] + [1,4,5] → Swap to [1,4,5,2,3]

- Now, [1,4,5,2,3]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first three: [1,4,5] + [2,3] → Swap to [2,3,1,4,5]

- Back to original.

- Split after first four: [2,3,1,4] + [5] → Swap to [5,2,3,1,4]

- Not sorted.

Seems like cannot be sorted with these operations, so "NO" is correct.

Another example:

```

4

3 1 2 4

```

First split at i=1 (0-based index 0):

- new = [1,2,4]

- a[0]=3 >= all in new: 3 >=1, 3>=2, 3>=4? No.

- So, print "NO".

Cannot be sorted, as seen earlier.

Wait, but what if the array requires splitting at a different point, not the first violation?

Let me consider:

```

5

1 3 2 4 5

```

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): 3>2.

Split into new=[2,4,5], x=[1,3].

Check a[0]=1 >= all in new: 1 >=2? No.

So, print "NO".

But if I try splitting at i=3 (0-based index 2): a[2]=2, a[3]=4.

Since a[2]=2 <= a[3]=4, no violation there.

So, the program only checks the first violation.

Hence, in this case, it's fine.

Another test case:

```

6

1 2 3 4 5 6

```

Already sorted, "YES".

Another test case:

```

4

2 1 3 4

```

Check if sorted: 2 ≥1 ≥3 ≥4 → Not sorted.

First violation at i=1 (0-based index 0): 2>1.

Split into new=[1,3,4], x=[2].

Check a[0]=2 >= all in new: 2 >=1, 2>=3? No.

So, print "NO".

Cannot be sorted, as seen earlier.

Seems like the program's logic is consistent with these test cases.

But to ensure its correctness, I need to think about the underlying logic more deeply.

Let's consider the operation allowed: split the array into prefix x and suffix y, and swap them.

This operation is equivalent to rotating the array by the length of x.

So, performing this operation multiple times corresponds to rotating the array multiple times.

Hence, the problem reduces to checking if the array can be made sorted by rotating it any number of times.

In standard rotation, we can check if the array is a rotation of a sorted array.

To check this, we can look for the minimum element and see if rotating to that point sorts the array.

But in this problem, the operation is more specific: it's a rotation by the length of the prefix, which must be a contiguous part of the array.

Hence, it's not exactly the same as arbitrary rotations.

Wait, but in the operation defined, we can choose any prefix and suffix, as long as a = x + y.

So, it's equivalent to rotating the array by the length of x.

Hence, we can achieve any rotation that is a multiple of the prefix length.

But since the prefix can be of any length, we can achieve any rotation.

Wait, but the prefix must be a contiguous start of the array, and the suffix is the remaining part.

Hence, rotating by any prefix length corresponds to rotating by that many positions.

So, we can achieve any rotation by choosing the appropriate prefix length.

Hence, the problem reduces to checking if the array can be made sorted by some rotation.

But in that case, the standard way to check this is to check if the array is a rotation of a sorted array.

Which can be done by checking if the array is a subarray of the sorted array concatenated to itself.

But the program seems to have a different logic.

So, perhaps the program's logic is sufficient.

Let me try to understand the program's logic more deeply.

The program checks:

- If the array is already sorted, print "YES".

- Else, find the first position i where a[i-1] > a[i].

- Split the array into new = a[i:] and x = a[:i].

- Check if a[0] >= all elements in new and new is sorted.

- If both conditions are satisfied, print "YES"; else, print "NO".

I need to see if this logic correctly determines if the array can be sorted by rotations.

Let me consider the array:

```

5

3 1 2 4 5

```

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): a[1]=3 > a[2]=1.

new = [1,2,4,5], x = [3].

Check a[0]=3 >= all in new: 3 >=1, 3>=2, 3>=4? No.

Hence, "NO".

But in this case, rotating the array:

- Rotate by 1: [1,2,4,5,3]

- Rotate by 2: [2,4,5,3,1]

- Rotate by 3: [4,5,3,1,2]

- Rotate by 4: [5,3,1,2,4]

None of these are sorted.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another array:

```

4

1 3 2 4

```

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): a[1]=3 > a[2]=2.

new = [2,4], x = [1,3].

Check a[0]=1 >= all in new: 1 >=2? No.

Hence, "NO".

And indeed, no rotation can sort this array.

Now, consider an array where rotation can sort it, but the program's conditions are not met.

Take:

```

5

4 5 1 2 3

```

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): a[1]=5 > a[2]=1.

new = [1,2,3], x = [4,5].

Check a[0]=4 >= all in new: 4 >=1, 4>=2, 4>=3 → True.

Check if new is sorted: [1,2,3] → Yes.

Hence, "YES".

Indeed, swapping x and y gives [1,2,3,4,5], which is sorted.

Correct.

Another case:

```

5

2 1 3 4 5

```

First violation at i=1 (0-based index 0): a[0]=2 > a[1]=1.

new = [1,3,4,5], x = [2].

Check a[0]=2 >= all in new: 2 >=1, 2>=3? No.

Hence, "NO".

Cannot be sorted, correct.

Wait, but if we rotate by 1, we get [1,3,4,5,2], which is not sorted.

If we rotate by 2, [3,4,5,2,1], not sorted.

And so on.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Now, let's consider an array where multiple operations are needed.

Take:

```

5

3 4 1 2 5

```

First violation at i=2 (0-based index 1): a[1]=4 > a[2]=1.

new = [1,2,5], x = [3,4].

Check a[0]=3 >= all in new: 3 >=1, 3>=2, 3>=5? No.

Hence, "NO".

But can this be sorted with operations?

- Original: [3,4,1,2,5]

- Split after first two: [3,4] + [1,2,5] → Swap to [1,2,5,3,4]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first one: [3] + [4,1,2,5] → Swap to [4,1,2,5,3]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first three: [3,4,1] + [2,5] → Swap to [2,5,3,4,1]

- Not sorted.

- Split after first four: [3,4,1,2] + [5] → Swap to [5,3,4,1,2]

- Not sorted.

Hence, cannot be sorted, "NO" is correct.

Another test case:

```

6

1 2 3 4 5 6

```

Already sorted, "YES".

Edge case:

```

2

1 2

```

Already sorted, "YES".

Edge case:

```

2

2 1

```

First violation at i=1 (0-based index 0): a[0]=2 > a[1]=1.

new = [1], x = [2].

Check a[0]=2 >= all in new: 2 >=1 → True.

Check if new is sorted: [1] → Yes.

Hence, "YES".

Indeed, swapping gives [1,2], which is sorted.

Correct.
