Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to help Bob set up stalls with specific pricing so that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins. The program needs to output "YES" if it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with integer prices between 1 and 10^18 to achieve this, and "NO" otherwise. If "YES", it should also specify the number of stalls and their prices.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall. The goal is to make sure she buys exactly k jewels.

The program provided seems to handle the task, but I need to verify if it covers all possible cases correctly. The program is written to handle multiple test cases, reading inputs for n and k, and then deciding whether it's possible to set up the stalls accordingly.

Looking at the program:

- It reads the number of test cases.

- For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

- In `func_1()`, it reads n and k.

- If n < k, it's impossible because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy k jewels (each jewel costs at least 1 coin). So, it prints "NO".

- If n == k, it means Alice can buy one jewel from one stall with price 1, but the program sets the price to n, which is equivalent to n jewels at price 1 each, but since n == k, it's effectively buying one jewel per coin, which seems correct.

- If n > k, it checks if k - 1 < n - k + 1. If true, it sets up two stalls: one with price n - k + 1 and another with price 1.

- Otherwise, it prints "NO".

I need to verify if this logic is sufficient for all cases.

Let me think about the problem more generally. The key is to set up stalls such that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

Given that Alice buys as many jewels as possible at each stall, the number of jewels bought at a stall with price p is floor(n / p). After buying from that stall, her remaining coins are n - (floor(n / p)) * p.

She repeats this process for each stall in order.

The challenge is to select prices for up to 60 stalls such that the total jewels bought is exactly k.

The program seems to handle three cases:

1. n < k: impossible, so "NO".

2. n == k: set up one stall with price 1, so Alice buys n jewels.

3. n > k: it checks if k - 1 < n - k + 1, and if so, sets up two stalls with prices n - k + 1 and 1.

I need to verify if this logic is correct and comprehensive.

Let's consider some examples.

Example 1 from the problem:

n = 7, k = 3

The program's output is "YES" with two stalls: 2 and 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, in the given program, it seems to output 10 stalls with prices 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, but according to the example answer, it's "YES" with 10 stalls.

But in the code provided, it seems to output only two stalls in some cases.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here. The given program seems different from the example answer.

Looking back at the program:

```

for _ in range(int(input())):

    func_1()

def func_1():

    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())

    if n < k:

        print('NO')

    elif n == k:

        print('YES')

        print(1)

        print(n)

    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:

        print('YES')

        print(2)

        print(n - k + 1, 1)

    else:

        print('NO')

```

This program only sets up either 1 or 2 stalls, but the example answer shows 10 stalls.

Is there a mistake in the program provided?

Wait, perhaps the program is incomplete or incorrect compared to the example.

In the example, it shows output with 10 stalls, but the provided program only sets up 1 or 2 stalls.

This is confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem and the program.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect because it doesn't always set up the correct number of stalls or prices.

Let me think about the logic.

In the first example:

n = 7, k = 3

The program would check:

n > k, so k - 1 = 2 < n - k + 1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5. Since 2 < 5, it's true, so it prints "YES" with 2 stalls: price1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5, price2 = 1.

So, stalls: 5 and 1.

Now, let's simulate Alice's buying:

- At stall 1 with price 5, she can buy floor(7/5) = 1 jewel, spending 5 coins. Remaining coins: 7 - 5 = 2.

- At stall 2 with price 1, she can buy floor(2/1) = 2 jewels, spending 2 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels bought: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

So, in this case, the program works correctly.

In the third example:

n = 255, k = 8

The program would check:

n > k, k - 1 = 7 < n - k + 1 = 255 - 8 + 1 = 248. Since 7 < 248, it's true, so it prints "YES" with 2 stalls: price1 = 248, price2 = 1.

Simulate Alice's buying:

- At stall 1 with price 248, she can buy floor(255/248) = 1 jewel, spending 248 coins. Remaining coins: 255 - 248 = 7.

- At stall 2 with price 1, she can buy floor(7/1) = 7 jewels, spending 7 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels bought: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k.

So, this seems correct.

But in the second example:

n = 6, k = 4

The program would check:

n > k, k - 1 = 3 < n - k + 1 = 6 - 4 + 1 = 3. Is 3 < 3? No, because it's equal. So, it's false, so it prints "NO".

But is it really impossible?

Let's see:

Can we set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins?

Option 1: One stall with price 1. She buys 6 jewels, which is more than 4. Not good.

Option 2: Two stalls. Let's try price1 = 2, price2 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Not enough.

Option 3: price1 = 3, price2 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/3) = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 2, which is less than 4.

Not enough.

Option 4: price1 = 2, price2 = 2.

- At stall 1: floor(6/2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 3, still less than 4.

Option 5: price1 = 1, price2 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

Not good.

Option 6: price1 = 1, price2 = 2.

- At stall 1: floor(6/1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 6, too many.

Option 7: price1 = 2, price2 = 3.

- At stall 1: floor(6/2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 3, too few.

Option 8: price1 = 1, price2 = 3.

- At stall 1: floor(6/1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 6, too many.

Option 9: price1 = 3, price2 = 2.

- At stall 1: floor(6/3) = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 2, too few.

Option 10: price1 = 4, price2 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/4) = 1 jewel, spends 4 coins. Remaining coins: 2.

- At stall 2: floor(2/1) = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, too few.

Option 11: price1 = 5, price2 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/5) = 1 jewel, spends 5 coins. Remaining coins: 1.

- At stall 2: floor(1/1) = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, too few.

Option 12: price1 = 1, price2 = 4.

- At stall 1: floor(6/1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 6, too many.

It seems that with two stalls, it's not possible to get exactly 4 jewels. But maybe with more than two stalls?

Let's try with three stalls:

price1 = 2, price2 = 2, price3 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

- At stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 3, too few.

Option 2: price1 = 3, price2 = 1, price3 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/3) = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

- At stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 2, too few.

Option 3: price1 = 2, price2 = 1, price3 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

- At stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 3, too few.

Option 4: price1 = 1, price2 = 2, price3 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

- At stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 6, too many.

Option 5: price1 = 1, price2 = 1, price3 = 2.

- At stall 1: floor(6/1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

- At stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 6, too many.

It seems that no matter how I set up the stalls, I can't get exactly 4 jewels for n=6 and k=4. So, perhaps the program is correct in outputting "NO" for this case.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "at most 60 stalls", but the program only considers up to 2 stalls. Maybe there's a way to set up more stalls to achieve exactly 4 jewels.

Let me try with more stalls.

Option: price1 = 2, price2 = 2, price3 = 2.

- At stall 1: floor(6/2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

- At stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 3, too few.

Option: price1 = 1, price2 = 2, price3 = 3.

- At stall 1: floor(6/1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

- At stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 6, too many.

Option: price1 = 1, price2 = 3, price3 = 2.

- At stall 1: floor(6/1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

- At stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 6, too many.

Option: price1 = 2, price2 = 1, price3 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

- At stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 3, too few.

Option: price1 = 3, price2 = 1, price3 = 1.

- At stall 1: floor(6/3) = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- At stall 2: can't buy any more.

- At stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 2, too few.

It seems consistent that with any number of stalls, it's not possible to get exactly 4 jewels for n=6. So, the program correctly outputs "NO" for this case.

Now, let's consider another case where n > k, and see if the program's condition holds.

Take n = 10, k = 4.

Check k - 1 = 3 < n - k + 1 = 10 - 4 + 1 = 7. Since 3 < 7, it's true, so it outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 7, price2 = 1.

Simulate Alice's buying:

- Stall 1: floor(10/7) = 1 jewel, spends 7 coins. Remaining coins: 3.

- Stall 2: floor(3/1) = 3 jewels, spends 3 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 3 = 4, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 5, k = 2.

Check k - 1 = 1 < n - k + 1 = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4. Since 1 < 4, it's true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 4, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(5/4) = 1 jewel, spends 4 coins. Remaining coins: 1.

- Stall 2: floor(1/1) = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 10, k = 1.

Check k - 1 = 0 < n - k + 1 = 10 - 1 + 1 = 10. Since 0 < 10, it's true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 10, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(10/10) = 1 jewel, spends 10 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- Stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 1, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 10, k = 5.

Check k - 1 = 4 < n - k + 1 = 10 - 5 + 1 = 6. Since 4 < 6, it's true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 6, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(10/6) = 1 jewel, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 4.

- Stall 2: floor(4/1) = 4 jewels, spends 4 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 10, k = 6.

Check k - 1 = 5 < n - k + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5. Is 5 < 5? No, so outputs "NO".

But is it really impossible?

Let's see:

Option: one stall with price 1. Alice buys 10 jewels, which is more than 6.

Option: two stalls, price1 = 5, price2 = 1.

- Stall 1: floor(10/5) = 2 jewels, spends 10 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- Stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 2, which is less than 6.

Option: price1 = 4, price2 = 2.

- Stall 1: floor(10/4) = 2 jewels, spends 8 coins. Remaining coins: 2.

- Stall 2: floor(2/2) = 1 jewel, spends 2 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 2 + 1 = 3, which is less than 6.

Option: price1 = 3, price2 = 2.

- Stall 1: floor(10/3) = 3 jewels, spends 9 coins. Remaining coins: 1.

- Stall 2: floor(1/2) = 0 jewels.

Total jewels: 3 + 0 = 3, which is less than 6.

Option: price1 = 2, price2 = 1.

- Stall 1: floor(10/2) = 5 jewels, spends 10 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- Stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 5, which is less than 6.

Option: price1 = 1, price2 = 1.

- Stall 1: floor(10/1) = 10 jewels, spends 10 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- Stall 2: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 10, which is more than 6.

Seems like it's impossible to get exactly 6 jewels with n=10. So, the program correctly outputs "NO".

Another case: n = 1, k = 1.

Program outputs "YES" with one stall: price = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(1/1) = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 1, k = 2.

Program outputs "NO" because n < k.

Indeed, it's impossible.

Seems correct.

Another case: n = 5, k = 3.

Program checks: k - 1 = 2 < n - k + 1 = 5 - 3 + 1 = 3. Since 2 < 3, outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 3, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(5/3) = 1 jewel, spends 3 coins. Remaining coins: 2.

- Stall 2: floor(2/1) = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 100, k = 10.

Program checks: 9 < 91, which is true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 91, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(100/91) = 1 jewel, spends 91 coins. Remaining coins: 9.

- Stall 2: floor(9/1) = 9 jewels, spends 9 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 9 = 10, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 100, k = 11.

Program checks: 10 < 90, which is true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 90, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(100/90) = 1 jewel, spends 90 coins. Remaining coins: 10.

- Stall 2: floor(10/1) = 10 jewels, spends 10 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 10 = 11, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 100, k = 12.

Program checks: 11 < 89, which is true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 89, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(100/89) = 1 jewel, spends 89 coins. Remaining coins: 11.

- Stall 2: floor(11/1) = 11 jewels, spends 11 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 11 = 12, which matches k.

Good.

Seems like the program works correctly for these cases.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it mentions that Bob can erect at most 60 stalls, but the program only sets up 1 or 2 stalls. Is there a case where setting up more than 2 stalls is necessary to achieve exactly k jewels?

Let's consider a case where n is slightly larger than k, but not enough to make k - 1 < n - k + 1 hold.

For example, n = 10, k = 5.

Program checks: 4 < 6, which is true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 6, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(10/6) = 1 jewel, spends 6 coins. Remaining coins: 4.

- Stall 2: floor(4/1) = 4 jewels, spends 4 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 5, which matches k.

But what if k is larger, say n = 10, k = 6.

Program outputs "NO", which seems correct from earlier analysis.

Another case: n = 10, k = 4.

Program outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 7, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(10/7) = 1 jewel, spends 7 coins. Remaining coins: 3.

- Stall 2: floor(3/1) = 3 jewels, spends 3 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 4, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 10, k = 3.

Program checks: 2 < 8, which is true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 8, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(10/8) = 1 jewel, spends 8 coins. Remaining coins: 2.

- Stall 2: floor(2/1) = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 3, which matches k.

Good.

Seems consistent.

Is there a case where setting up more than two stalls is necessary?

Let's consider n = 5, k = 2.

Program outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 4, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(5/4) = 1 jewel, spends 4 coins. Remaining coins: 1.

- Stall 2: floor(1/1) = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 2, which matches k.

Good.

What if I try to set up three stalls for n = 5, k = 2.

Price1 = 3, price2 = 2, price3 = 1.

- Stall 1: floor(5/3) = 1 jewel, spends 3 coins. Remaining coins: 2.

- Stall 2: floor(2/2) = 1 jewel, spends 2 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- Stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2.

Same result as with two stalls.

So, in this case, two stalls suffice, and adding a third doesn't change the total jewels bought.

Another case: n = 10, k = 3.

Program outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 4, price2 = 1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(10/4) = 2 jewels, spends 8 coins. Remaining coins: 2.

- Stall 2: floor(2/1) = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 2 + 2 = 4, which is more than k. Wait, this doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, floor(10/4) = 2 jewels, spends 8 coins. Remaining coins: 2.

Then, stall 2: floor(2/1) = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 2 + 2 = 4, which is more than k=3.

Wait, but according to the program's logic, for n=10, k=3:

k - 1 = 2 < n - k + 1 = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8. Since 2 < 8, it's true, so it sets price1 = 8, price2 = 1.

Wait, I need to check with price1 = 8, price2 =1.

- Stall 1: floor(10/8) = 1 jewel, spends 8 coins. Remaining coins: 2.

- Stall 2: floor(2/1) = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

So, earlier miscalculation was due to incorrect price1.

Thus, the program's logic seems correct.

Another case: n = 8, k = 4.

Program checks: 3 < 5, which is true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 5, price2 =1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(8/5) = 1 jewel, spends 5 coins. Remaining coins: 3.

- Stall 2: floor(3/1) = 3 jewels, spends 3 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 3 = 4, which matches k.

Good.

Seems like the program's logic works for these cases.

Is there any case where the program's condition fails, but it's actually possible with more than two stalls?

Let's consider n = 7, k = 4.

Program checks: 3 < 4, which is true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 = 4, price2 =1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(7/4) = 1 jewel, spends 4 coins. Remaining coins: 3.

- Stall 2: floor(3/1) = 3 jewels, spends 3 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 3 = 4, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 9, k = 5.

Program checks: 4 < 5, which is true, so outputs "YES" with two stalls: price1 =5, price2=1.

Simulate:

- Stall 1: floor(9/5) = 1 jewel, spends 5 coins. Remaining coins: 4.

- Stall 2: floor(4/1) = 4 jewels, spends 4 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k.

Good.

Another case: n = 10, k = 7.

Program checks: 6 < 4, which is false, so outputs "NO".

But let's see if it's possible with more stalls.

Try with three stalls: price1 = 3, price2 = 3, price3 = 2.

- Stall 1: floor(10/3) = 3 jewels, spends 9 coins. Remaining coins: 1.

- Stall 2: floor(1/3) = 0 jewels.

- Stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 3 + 0 = 3, which is less than 7.

Not good.

Another try: price1 = 2, price2 = 2, price3 = 1.

- Stall 1: floor(10/2) = 5 jewels, spends 10 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- Stall 2: can't buy any more.

- Stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 5, which is less than 7.

Another try: price1 = 1, price2 = 2, price3 = 3.

- Stall 1: floor(10/1) = 10 jewels, spends 10 coins. Remaining coins: 0.

- Stall 2: can't buy any more.

- Stall 3: can't buy any more.

Total jewels: 10, which is more than 7.

Seems like it's impossible to get exactly 7 jewels with n=10, regardless of the number of stalls. So, the program correctly outputs "NO".

Therefore, the program's logic seems correct: for n < k, it's impossible; for n == k, set up one stall with price 1; for n > k, if k - 1 < n - k + 1, set up two stalls with prices n - k + 1 and 1; otherwise, output "NO".

This logic covers all cases correctly, as per the examples and additional test cases I've considered.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
