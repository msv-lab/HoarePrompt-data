Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets all the requirements for every possible input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, let's understand the problem description. The game involves n possible outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i. I need to bet integer amounts on each outcome such that, no matter which outcome wins, the total coins I get back are more than the total coins I bet. In other words, for each outcome i, the bet on i multiplied by its multiplier k_i should be greater than the sum of all bets.

The program provided seems to attempt to solve this by calculating bets based on the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers. It computes the LCM of all k_i values and then calculates each bet as the LCM divided by the respective k_i. Finally, it checks if the sum of these bets is less than the LCM for any outcome.

Let me walk through the program step by step.

1. **Reading Input:**

- The program reads the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes, n, and the list of multipliers, k_i.

2. **Helper Functions:**

- `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.

- `func_2()`: This is the main function that processes each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**

- It reads n and the list of k_i.

- It initializes den as the first multiplier and iteratively computes the LCM of all k_i.

- It calculates the bets as vprod = [den // r for r in vals], which are the LCM divided by each k_i.

- It calculates den = den - sum(vprod). If den <= 0, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the bets.

Now, I need to verify if this approach is correct for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

**Key Points to Verify:**

1. **Correctness of LCM Calculation:**

- The LCM calculation seems correct using the GCD method.

2. **Bet Calculation:**

- Bets are calculated as LCM divided by each k_i.

- The sum of these bets should be less than the LCM for the program to print the bets; otherwise, it prints -1.

3. **Condition Check:**

- The condition den = LCM - sum(vprod) > 0 is checked.

- This seems related to ensuring that the total bets are less than the minimum return for any outcome.

But wait, let's think carefully.

**Understanding the Requirement:**

For each outcome i:

- Bet on i: x_i

- Total bets: S = sum(x_j for all j)

- When outcome i wins, you get back k_i * x_i coins.

- The condition is S < k_i * x_i for all i.

We need to find x_i such that S < k_i * x_i for all i.

Given that, let's see if the program's approach satisfies this condition.

**Program's Approach:**

- Compute LCM of all k_i.

- Set x_i = LCM / k_i for each i.

- Compute S = sum(LCM / k_i for all i).

- Check if S < LCM for any i.

Wait, no. The program computes den = LCM - sum(LCM / k_i), and if den > 0, it prints the bets; else, -1.

But the condition should be S < k_i * x_i for all i.

Let's plug in the values:

k_i * x_i = k_i * (LCM / k_i) = LCM

So, S < LCM for all i.

But since S is the same for all i, we just need S < LCM.

But LCM is the same for all i, so S < LCM is equivalent to sum(LCM / k_i) < LCM.

Wait, this doesn't seem right.

Let me think differently.

The condition S < k_i * x_i for all i must hold.

Given that x_i = LCM / k_i, then k_i * x_i = LCM for all i.

So, S < LCM for all i.

Since LCM is the same for all i, S < LCM is sufficient.

But is this the tightest condition?

Wait, actually, since S < LCM for all i, and LCM is the same, it's sufficient.

But is this the only condition needed?

Yes, because for each i, S < LCM = k_i * x_i.

Hence, the program's condition den = LCM - S > 0 seems correct.

But let's verify with the example given.

**Example 1:**

Input:

3

3 2 7

Output:

27 41 12

Total S = 27 + 41 + 12 = 80

For each outcome:

- Outcome 1: 3 * 27 = 81 > 80

- Outcome 2: 2 * 41 = 82 > 80

- Outcome 3: 7 * 12 = 84 > 80

Which matches the program's output.

**Example 2:**

Input:

2

3 3

Output:

1 1

Total S = 1 + 1 = 2

For each outcome:

- Outcome 1: 3 * 1 = 3 > 2

- Outcome 2: 3 * 1 = 3 > 2

Which is correct.

**Example 3:**

Input:

5

5 5 5 5 5

Output:

-1

Let's see why.

LCM of [5,5,5,5,5] is 5.

x_i = 5 / 5 = 1 for all i.

S = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Check if 5 < 5 for any i: 5 < 5 is False.

Hence, -1 is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for these examples.

But is this approach correct in general?

Let me think about it.

Given that S < LCM, and for each i, k_i * x_i = LCM, the condition S < LCM ensures that S < k_i * x_i for all i.

Hence, it seems correct.

But is there a case where S < LCM, but S >= k_i * x_i for some i?

Wait, no, because k_i * x_i = LCM for all i.

Hence, if S < LCM, then S < k_i * x_i for all i.

So, the program's condition is sufficient.

But is it necessary?

Wait, suppose there exists another set of x_i that satisfies S < min_k k_i * x_i, but S >= LCM.

Is that possible?

Given that x_i are integers, and k_i are given, perhaps there are solutions where S < min_k k_i * x_i, but S >= LCM.

But in the program's approach, it sets x_i = LCM / k_i, which makes k_i * x_i = LCM.

Hence, the condition S < LCM is equivalent to S < k_i * x_i for all i.

So, it seems correct.

But let's think about edge cases.

**Edge Case 1: n = 1**

If n = 1, say k_1 = 2.

Then, LCM = 2.

x_1 = 2 / 2 = 1.

S = 1 < 2.

Hence, it should print 1.

Which seems correct.

**Edge Case 2: n = 2, k = [2,3]**

LCM = 6.

x_1 = 6 / 2 = 3

x_2 = 6 / 3 = 2

S = 3 + 2 = 5 < 6.

Hence, it should print 3 2.

Which is correct.

**Edge Case 3: All k_i are the same**

Say n = 3, k = [5,5,5]

As in Example 3, output -1, which is correct.

**Edge Case 4: Minimal k_i**

k_i = 2 for all i.

For n = 1: k=2, x=1, S=1 < 2.

For n = 2: k=2,2; x=1,1; S=2 < 2? No, 2 >= 2, so -1.

Wait, according to the program:

den = LCM - sum(vprod) = 2 - (1 + 1) = 0.

Since den <=0, it prints -1.

Which is correct.

Hence, the program seems to handle this correctly.

**Edge Case 5: Large n**

n=50, k_i=2 for all i.

Then, LCM=2.

vprod = [1]*50

S=50

den=2-50=-48 <=0, prints -1.

Which is correct, since S=50 >= 2*k_i*x_i=2*1=2 for any i.

Hence, correct.

**Edge Case 6: Different k_i**

n=3, k=[2,3,5]

LCM=30.

x=[15,10,6]

S=15+10+6=31

den=30-31=-1 <=0, prints -1.

Wait, but according to the condition S=31 < 30? No, 31 < 30 is False.

Hence, it should print -1, which is correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, we need S < k_i*x_i for all i.

For i=1: k=2, x=15, k*x=30.

S=31 < 30? No.

Hence, -1 is correct.

But in this case, S=31 is not less than 30.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Edge Case 7: n=1, k=2**

LCM=2.

x=2/2=1.

S=1 < 2.

Hence, prints 1, which is correct.

**Edge Case 8: n=1, k=1**

Wait, but k_i >=2 as per constraints.

Hence, no need to consider k=1.

**Edge Case 9: n=2, k=[2,4]**

LCM=4.

x=[2,1].

S=2+1=3 <4.

Hence, prints 2 1, which is correct.

Because for outcome 1: 2*2=4 >3

Outcome 2:4*1=4 >3.

Hence, correct.

**Edge Case 10: n=3, k=[2,3,7]**

LCM=42.

x=[21,14,6].

S=21+14+6=41 <42.

Hence, prints 21 14 6, which is correct.

Because for each outcome:

2*21=42 >41

3*14=42 >41

7*6=42 >41

Hence, correct.

**Edge Case 11: n=4, k=[2,3,4,5]**

LCM=60.

x=[30,20,15,12].

S=30+20+15+12=77.

den=60-77=-17 <=0, prints -1.

Which is correct, since S=77 >=60 for all i.

Wait, but according to the condition, S < k_i*x_i for all i.

For i=1:2*30=60 <77? No.

Hence, -1 is correct.

**Edge Case 12: n=2, k=[2,5]**

LCM=10.

x=[5,2].

S=5+2=7 <10.

Hence, prints 5 2.

Which is correct:

2*5=10 >7

5*2=10 >7

Hence, correct.

**Edge Case 13: n=1, k=[100]**

LCM=100.

x=[100/100=1].

S=1 <100.

Hence, prints 1, which is correct.

**Edge Case 14: n=50, k_i=2 for all i**

LCM=2.

x_i=1 for all i.

S=50.

den=2-50=-48 <=0, prints -1.

Which is correct.

**Edge Case 15: n=50, k_i=20 for all i**

LCM=20.

x_i=1 for all i.

S=50.

den=20-50=-30 <=0, prints -1.

Which is correct.

**Edge Case 16: n=1, k=[20]**

LCM=20.

x=20/20=1.

S=1 <20.

Hence, prints 1, which is correct.

**Edge Case 17: n=2, k=[2,20]**

LCM=20.

x=[10,1].

S=10+1=11 <20.

Hence, prints 10 1, which is correct.

Because:

2*10=20 >11

20*1=20 >11

Hence, correct.

**Edge Case 18: n=3, k=[3,4,5]**

LCM=60.

x=[20,15,12].

S=20+15+12=47 <60.

Hence, prints 20 15 12, which is correct.

Because:

3*20=60 >47

4*15=60 >47

5*12=60 >47

Hence, correct.

**Edge Case 19: n=4, k=[2,3,4,6]**

LCM=12.

x=[6,4,3,2].

S=6+4+3+2=15.

den=12-15=-3 <=0, prints -1.

Which is correct, since S=15 >=12 for all i.

**Edge Case 20: n=3, k=[2,3,5]**

LCM=30.

x=[15,10,6].

S=15+10+6=31.

den=30-31=-1 <=0, prints -1.

Which is correct, since S=31 >=30 for all i.

**Alternative Approach:**

Is there a way to have S < k_i * x_i for all i with different x_i?

The program's approach seems to be one possible solution, but is it the only one?

Suppose we have n=2, k=[2,3].

Program's approach:

LCM=6.

x=[3,2].

S=5 <6.

Which is correct.

But is there a solution with smaller x_i?

Say x=[2,1].

S=3 <2*2=4 and 3 <3*1=3? No, 3 is not less than 3.

Hence, no solution exists, which matches the program's output of -1.

Wait, but according to the program, it would print 3 2 for n=2, k=[2,3], which is correct as shown earlier.

Hence, the program seems to be correct.

**Conclusion:**

After considering multiple test cases and edge scenarios, the program appears to correctly determine whether it's possible to distribute the coins as required and, if so, provides a valid set of bets. The use of LCM to calculate bets ensures that the conditions are met when possible, and correctly identifies cases where no solution exists.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
