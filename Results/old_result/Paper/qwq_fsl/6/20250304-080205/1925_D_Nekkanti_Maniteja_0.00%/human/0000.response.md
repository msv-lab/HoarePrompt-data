Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program is correct, I need to print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partial correctness isn't accepted; the program must handle every potential case as per the description.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the provided program.

### Problem Description

There are `n` children in a class, and `m` pairs among them are friends, each with a friendship value `f_i`. The teacher goes on `k` excursions, and for each excursion, she randomly chooses a pair of children equiprobably and independently. If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. Pairs who are not friends have a friendship value of 0, which doesn't change.

We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). The answer should be expressed as a fraction `p/q` where `p` and `q` are coprime, and we need to compute `p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7)`.

### Provided Program

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

### Analysis

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem fully.

- There are `n` children.
- `m` pairs of friends, each with a friendship value `f_i`.
- `k` excursions, each time a pair is chosen randomly.
- If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- We need the expected sum of friendship values at the time of choice for all `k` excursions.

### Approach

To solve this, we need to calculate the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions and compute the expected sum accordingly.

### Solution Code

The provided solution attempts to compute this expected sum using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and inverse elements for division under modulo.

### Explanation

1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Read `m` lines, each containing `u`, `v`, and `f` for the friendship pairs.

2. **Modular Constant:**
   - `M = 10**9 + 7`: Modulo constant for the final answer.

3. **Inverse Calculation:**
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`: This seems to calculate the modular inverse of the total number of pairs, but there might be a mistake here. The total number of possible pairs is `n*(n-1)//2`, but the code has `n*(n-1)//1`.

4. **Sum Calculation:**
   - Initialize `s = 0` and `a = 0`.
   - Sum up all friendship values `a += f` for all `m` pairs.
   - For each excursion `i` from 0 to `k-1`, add to `s`: `c * i * c * m + c * a`.

5. **Print the Result:**
   - Print `s % M` for each test case.

### Potential Issues

1. **Total Number of Pairs:**
   - The total number of unique pairs is `n*(n-1)//2`, but the code uses `n*(n-1)//1`, which is just `n*(n-1)`. This seems incorrect.

2. **Inverse Calculation:**
   - The inverse should be calculated for `n*(n-1)//2`, not `n*(n-1)//1`.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum `s` is accumulated as `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` for each `i` in `0` to `k-1`.
   - This seems to be an incorrect way to model the expected sum, especially considering the dynamic nature of friendship values increasing over time.

### Correctness

Given the potential issues, particularly in calculating the total number of pairs and the way the sum `s` is accumulated, the program likely does not correctly compute the expected sum of friendship values.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not accurately model the problem's requirements, specifically in calculating the total number of pairs and accumulating the sum `s` over excursions.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
