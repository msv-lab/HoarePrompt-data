Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to solve a problem involving building bridges over a river grid, minimizing the cost of installing supports for the bridges. There are constraints on where supports can be placed and the distance between them.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. Let's break it down.

We have a river represented as a grid with n rows and m columns. Each cell has a depth value a_{i,j}, and the depths on the first and last columns are always 0, representing the river banks. Rudolf wants to build k bridges on consecutive rows, and for each bridge, he needs to install supports according to specific rules:

1. A support must be installed in the first and last columns of the row (cells (i,1) and (i,m)).

2. The distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d, where distance is defined as |j1 - j2| - 1.

The cost of installing a support in cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1. The goal is to minimize the total cost of supports for building k consecutive bridges.

The program provided seems to handle this by defining two functions: func_1 and func_2. Func_2 reads the input, processes the grid for each row using func_1 to calculate the cost for each row, and then finds the minimum total cost for k consecutive rows.

Let's look into func_1 more closely, as it seems to be the core of the cost calculation for each row.

In func_1, it takes a row and the distance constraint d. It initializes the first cell to 1 (since a_{i,1} is 0, so cost is 1). Then, for the next d-1 cells, it sets each cell's value to the sum of its own value and 2. This part is a bit unclear; perhaps it's intended to account for the initial supports.

Then, it creates a min-heap with the first d cells and iterates through the rest of the row, maintaining a sliding window of size d+1, updating the cost for each cell based on the minimum cost in the previous d cells.

Wait a minute, this seems similar to a dynamic programming approach where we keep track of the minimum cost within a sliding window.

But let's verify if this logic correctly implements the requirements.

First, supports must be placed at both ends, so cells (i,1) and (i,m) always have supports.

Second, the distance between any two adjacent supports should not exceed d.

This means that between the supports, the maximum gap allowed is d-1 cells.

So, for example, if d=3, supports can be placed at positions 1, 4, 7, etc., up to m.

But in the code, it's using a sliding window to keep track of the minimum cost within the last d cells.

I need to ensure that this approach correctly enforces the distance constraint.

Let me think about how supports are placed.

We need to place supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most d.

This can be modeled as selecting a subset of positions from 1 to m, with the constraints:

- Position 1 and m are included.

- For any two consecutive supports, the distance between them is at most d.

And we need to minimize the total cost.

This sounds like a classic dynamic programming problem where we keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position, considering the last support placed within the last d positions.

In other words, for each position j from 1 to m, dp[j] represents the minimum cost to reach j with supports placed according to the rules.

The recurrence relation would be:

dp[j] = min(dp[j - k]) + cost[j] for k from 1 to d, where j - k >= 1.

But in the code, it's using a sliding window minimum approach with a heap to efficiently get the minimum cost in the last d cells.

This seems correct in principle.

But let's check the implementation details.

In func_1:

- row[0] is set to 1 (since a_{i,1} is 0, cost is 1).

- For the next d-1 cells, row[i] is set to row[i] + 2. This seems arbitrary; perhaps it's meant to account for mandatory supports, but it's not clear.

- Then, it initializes a min-heap with the first d cells.

- For each cell i from d to m-1, it pops elements from the heap that are outside the window (i - (d + 2)), which seems off.

Wait, i - (d + 2) seems incorrect. If d is the maximum distance between supports, then the window should consider the last d cells.

I think there might be a mistake in the heap management.

Let me consider an example to verify.

Take the first example from the input:

n=3, m=11, k=1, d=4

Rows:

0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0

0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0

We need to build 1 bridge on any one of the 3 rows, and minimize the support cost.

According to the output, the minimum cost is 4.

Let's see for the second row: 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

If we build a bridge on this row, we need to place supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most 4.

We must place supports at positions 1 and 11.

Possible support placements:

- Place supports at 1, 5, 11: distances are 4 and 6, which violates d=4.

- Place supports at 1, 6, 11: distances are 5 and 5, which violates d=4.

- Place supports at 1, 5, 9, 11: distances are 4, 4, 2, which is acceptable.

Cost would be a_{i,1}+1 + a_{i,5}+1 + a_{i,9}+1 + a_{i,11}+1 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7.

But the output is 4, which is lower, so perhaps there's a better placement.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, a_{i,1}=0, a_{i,5}=2, a_{i,9}=2, a_{i,11}=0.

So costs are 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8, which is higher than 4.

So there must be a better way.

Perhaps placing supports at 1, 3, 7, 11.

Distances: 2, 4, 4.

Costs: a_{i,1}+1 + a_{i,3}+1 + a_{i,7}+1 + a_{i,11}+1 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 9.

Still higher than 4.

Wait, maybe placing supports at 1, 4, 8, 11.

Distances: 3, 4, 3.

Costs: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10.

Still higher.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to place fewer supports.

Wait, maybe d=4 allows larger distances.

Wait, d is the maximum distance between supports, so the distance cannot be larger than d.

Wait, but in the first example, the output is 4, but in my calculation, I'm getting higher costs.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps d=4 means the distance between supports can be up to 4, meaning supports can be placed every 4 cells at most.

Wait, no, d is the maximum distance between supports.

So, the distance between any two adjacent supports should not exceed d.

In terms of positions, if supports are placed at positions j and j+k, then k-1 <= d, so k <= d+1.

Wait, distance is |j1 - j2| - 1 <= d, so |j1 - j2| <= d + 1.

Wait, in the first example, d=4, so |j1 - j2| -1 <=4, meaning |j1 - j2| <=5.

Wait, but in the sample input, the minimal cost is 4, but my manual calculation gives higher costs.

Perhaps I need to consider overlapping supports or something else.

Wait, maybe I need to reconsider the problem.

Looking back at the problem statement:

- Supports must be installed in cell (i,1) and (i,m).

- The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d, where the distance between cells (i,j1) and (i,j2) is |j1 - j2| -1.

So, the actual positions' indices difference minus one should not exceed d.

Hence, |j2 - j1| -1 <= d, which means |j2 - j1| <= d+1.

So, supports can be placed at positions where their indices differ by at most d+1.

This is equivalent to placing supports such that no gap between them exceeds d cells.

Now, in the first row: 0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0

We must place supports at 1 and 11.

To have the minimal cost, we need to place supports in such a way that the total cost is minimized.

Let's try to find the minimal cost for this row.

Possible support placements:

- 1, 5, 11: distances 4 and 5 (since |5-1|-1=3, |11-5|-1=5). Wait, |5-1|-1=3 <=4, |11-5|-1=5 <=4? Wait, 5 >4, so invalid.

- 1, 6, 11: |6-1|-1=4 <=4, |11-6|-1=4 <=4. Valid.

Cost: a[1]+1 + a[6]+1 + a[11]+1 = 0+1 + 5+1 + 0+1 = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8.

But the minimal cost is 4, which is less than 8, so there must be a better placement.

Wait, maybe placing supports at 1, 3, 9, 11.

Distances: |3-1|-1=1 <=4, |9-3|-1=5 <=4? 5 >4, invalid.

- 1,4,8,11: |4-1|-1=2 <=4, |8-4|-1=3 <=4, |11-8|-1=2 <=4. Valid.

Cost: a[1]+1 + a[4]+1 + a[8]+1 + a[11]+1 = 0+1 + 3+1 + 3+1 + 0+1 = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10.

Still higher than 4.

Wait, how can the minimal cost be 4?

Let's consider placing supports only at 1 and 11.

Distances: |11-1|-1=9 <=4? No, 9 >4, invalid.

So, supports must be placed at least at 1, some position between, and 11.

Is there a way to place supports with total cost 4?

Wait, in the first row: 0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0

If we place supports at 1,5,9,11.

Distances: |5-1|-1=3 <=4, |9-5|-1=3 <=4, |11-9|-1=1 <=4.

Cost: a[1]+1 + a[5]+1 + a[9]+1 + a[11]+1 = 0+1 + 4+1 + 2+1 + 0+1 = 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 10.

Still 10.

Wait, maybe placing supports at 1,6,11.

Distances: |6-1|-1=4 <=4, |11-6|-1=4 <=4.

Cost: a[1]+1 + a[6]+1 + a[11]+1 = 0+1 + 5+1 + 0+1 = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8.

Still higher than 4.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the cost is calculated differently.

Wait, the cost is the sum of a_{i,j} +1 for each support placed.

In the first row, to get a total cost of 4, perhaps only placing supports at 1 and 11 is allowed, but as we saw, that violates the distance constraint because |11-1|-1=9 >4.

So, according to my reasoning, the minimal cost should be at least 8, but the sample output is 4.

This suggests that my understanding is incorrect.

Perhaps I'm misinterpreting the distance between supports.

Wait, maybe the distance is defined differently.

Let me re-read the problem statement.

"The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d. The distance between supports (i,j1) and (i,j2) is |j1 - j2| -1."

So, the distance is |j1 - j2| -1.

So, for supports at positions j1 and j2, the distance is |j1 - j2| -1.

Therefore, the maximum distance between any two adjacent supports should not exceed d.

So, for supports placed at j1, j2, j3, ..., jm, for any two consecutive supports jk and jk+1, (jk+1 - jk -1) <= d.

Wait, that means jk+1 - jk -1 <= d, which implies jk+1 - jk <= d+1.

So, the positions of supports should be such that the difference between consecutive positions is at most d+1.

In other words, supports should be placed at positions where the gap between them is at most d cells.

Wait, but in the first sample input, with d=4, to place supports at positions 1 and 11, which have a distance of 10, which is greater than d=4.

But according to the sample output, the minimal cost is 4, which suggests that there must be a way to place supports with total cost 4.

Unless there's a way to place supports in a way that I'm missing.

Wait, maybe the row chosen isn't the first row, but the second or third row.

Wait, in the first sample input, it's building a bridge on the second row that gives the minimal cost.

Wait, the explanation in the sample says it's most profitable to build a bridge on the second row.

So, let's look at the second row: 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

We need to place supports at positions where the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most d=4.

So, positions j1=1, j2=?, ..., jm=11.

We must have jk+1 - jk -1 <=4, meaning jk+1 - jk <=5.

So, the maximum gap between supports is 5 cells.

Given m=11, to go from 1 to 11 with maximum gap of 5, the possible support positions could be 1,6,11.

Let's check the distances: |6-1|-1=4 <=4, |11-6|-1=4 <=4.

So, supports at 1,6,11 are acceptable.

Total cost: a[1]+1 + a[6]+1 + a[11]+1 = 0+1 +1+1 +0+1 =1 +2 +1=4.

Ah, there we go! So, the minimal cost is indeed 4 by placing supports at positions 1,6,11.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, in this case, it's possible to achieve the minimal cost of 4.

Good, now, is the program correctly calculating this?

Looking back at the code, in func_1, it processes each row to calculate the minimal cost.

I need to verify if func_1 correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to find the minimal cost for each row.

In func_1, it sets row[0]=1, which corresponds to position 1 with cost 1.

Then, for the next d cells, it sets row[i]=row[i]+2.

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, in the sample input, d=4, m=11.

For the second row: 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

func_1 would set row[0]=1 (position 1).

Then, for i in range(1,4): row[i]=row[i]+2.

So, row[1]=1+2=3, row[2]=2+2=4, row[3]=3+2=5.

Then, it creates a min-heap with the first d=4 cells: (1,0), (3,1), (4,2), (5,3).

Wait, but in the code, it's min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])], which for d=4 and row=[1,3,4,5], so min_heap = [(1,0),(3,1),(4,2),(5,3)].

Then, for i in range(d, m):

i=4:

Pop elements where e[1] <= i - (d+2) =4 -6=-2, which is always false, so no elements are popped.

Then, row[4]= min_heap[0][0] + row[4] +1 =1 +2 +1=4.

Then, push (4,4) into the heap.

Similarly, for i=5:

No elements to pop.

row[5]= min_heap[0][0] + row[5] +1=1 +1 +1=3.

Push (3,5).

For i=6:

row[6]= min_heap[0][0] + row[6] +1=1 +2 +1=4.

Push (4,6).

For i=7:

row[7]=1 +3 +1=5.

Push (5,7).

For i=8:

row[8]=1 +3 +1=5.

Push (5,8).

For i=9:

row[9]=1 +2 +1=4.

Push (4,9).

For i=10:

row[10]=1 +0 +1=2.

Push (2,10).

So, the final row is [1,3,4,5,4,3,4,5,5,4,2].

Then, the cost for this row is row[-1]=2.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, the minimal cost should be 4.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the dp array is being built.

Wait, in this approach, dp[j] represents the minimal cost to reach position j.

But in the sample explanation, the minimal cost is 4, but according to this dp array, row[-1]=2, which is less than 4.

This suggests that the dp array is not correctly capturing the total cost.

Wait, perhaps the dp[j] should represent the total cost up to position j, including supports placed up to j.

But in the sample, the minimal cost is 4, which is the sum of supports placed at positions 1,6,11.

But according to the dp array, row[-1]=2, which is less than 4.

This indicates a mistake in the dp implementation.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's printing 4, which matches the expected minimal cost.

But according to the dp array I just calculated, row[-1]=2, which is less than 4.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in simulating the dp array.

Let me recalculate the dp array step by step for the second row: 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0

Initialize row[0]=1.

For i=1 to d-1=3:

row[1]=1+2=3

row[2]=2+2=4

row[3]=3+2=5

min_heap = [(1,0),(3,1),(4,2),(5,3)]

Now, for i=4:

No elements to pop since e[1] <=4-6=-2 is false.

row[4]= min_heap[0][0] + row[4] +1 =1 +2 +1=4

Push (4,4)

min_heap now: [(1,0),(3,1),(4,2),(4,4),(5,3)]

For i=5:

No elements to pop.

row[5]= min_heap[0][0] + row[5] +1=1 +1 +1=3

Push (3,5)

min_heap now: [(1,0),(3,1),(3,5),(4,2),(4,4),(5,3)]

For i=6:

No elements to pop.

row[6]= min_heap[0][0] + row[6] +1=1 +2 +1=4

Push (4,6)

min_heap now: [(1,0),(3,1),(3,5),(4,2),(4,4),(4,6),(5,3)]

For i=7:

No elements to pop.

row[7]= min_heap[0][0] + row[7] +1=1 +3 +1=5

Push (5,7)

min_heap now: [(1,0),(3,1),(3,5),(4,2),(4,4),(4,6),(5,3),(5,7)]

For i=8:

No elements to pop.

row[8]= min_heap[0][0] + row[8] +1=1 +3 +1=5

Push (5,8)

min_heap now: [(1,0),(3,1),(3,5),(4,2),(4,4),(4,6),(5,3),(5,7),(5,8)]

For i=9:

No elements to pop.

row[9]= min_heap[0][0] + row[9] +1=1 +2 +1=4

Push (4,9)

min_heap now: [(1,0),(3,1),(3,5),(4,2),(4,4),(4,6),(4,9),(5,3),(5,7),(5,8)]

For i=10:

No elements to pop.

row[10]= min_heap[0][0] + row[10] +1=1 +0 +1=2

Push (2,10)

min_heap now: [(1,0),(2,10),(3,1),(3,5),(4,2),(4,4),(4,6),(4,9),(5,3),(5,7),(5,8)]

So, the dp array is [1,3,4,5,4,3,4,5,5,4,2]

But according to the sample explanation, the minimal cost should be 4.

However, row[-1]=2, which is less than 4.

This suggests that the dp array is not correctly capturing the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the total cost is the sum of the supports, not just the last element in the dp array.

Wait, looking back at func_1, it returns row[-1], which is the dp value for the last cell.

But in the sample explanation, the minimal cost is 4, which is the sum of supports placed at positions 1,6,11: 1 + 2 + 1 =4.

But according to the dp array, row[-1]=2, which doesn't match.

This indicates a flaw in the dp implementation.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but the sample output is 4, which matches the expected minimal cost.

How is that possible if the dp array suggests row[-1]=2?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the dp array relates to the total cost.

Perhaps row[j] represents the minimal cost to reach position j, assuming that a support is placed at j.

In that case, row[-1] would be the minimal cost to reach the last position with a support there.

In the sample, row[-1]=2, but the expected minimal cost is 4.

This suggests that the dp implementation is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the dp transition needs to account for the cost of placing a support at j, which is a[j]+1, plus the minimal cost from the previous support within the last d positions.

In that case, row[j] should be (a[j]+1) + min(row[j - k] for k in 1 to d+1).

But in the code, it's adding min_heap[0][0] + row[j] +1.

Wait, perhaps row[j] is intended to accumulate the cost up to j.

But in that case, row[j] should include the cost of placing a support at j and the minimal cost up to the previous support within the last d positions.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust my understanding.

Let me try to redefine dp[j]:

dp[j] = minimal total cost to reach position j, including the cost of placing a support at j.

Then, for each j from 1 to m:

dp[j] = (a[j] + 1) + min(dp[j - k] for k in 1 to d+1 if j - k >=0)

To compute this efficiently, we can maintain a sliding window of size d over the dp array and keep track of the minimum dp value in that window.

The code seems to be attempting this with a min-heap.

However, in the simulation above, row[-1]=2, which is less than the expected minimal cost of 4.

This suggests that there's an error in the dp transition.

Wait, perhaps the dp transition should be:

dp[j] = (a[j] + 1) + min(dp[j - k] for k in 1 to d+1 if j - k >=0)

But in the code, it's setting dp[j] = min_heap[0][0] + row[j] +1.

Wait, no, actually, row[j] is being updated to min_heap[0][0] + row[j] +1.

But row[j] initially contains a[j], so row[j] +1 is a[j] +1, the cost of placing a support at j.

So, dp[j] = min(dp[j - k]) for j -k in the window + (a[j] +1)

Hence, dp[j] = min(dp[j -k]) + (a[j] +1)

This seems correct.

In the simulation above, for j=4:

dp[4] = min(dp[3], dp[2], dp[1], dp[0]) + (a[4] +1) = min(5,4,3,1) +3 =1 +3=4

Wait, but in the simulation, row[4]=4, which matches.

For j=5:

dp[5] = min(dp[4], dp[3], dp[2], dp[1]) + (a[5]+1) = min(4,5,4,3) +2 =2 +2=4

Wait, but in the simulation, row[5]=3, which is less than 4.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the simulation.

Wait, in the code, it's:

for i in range(d, m):

while e := heappop(min_heap)[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] +1

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

Wait, in the simulation for i=5:

min_heap is [(1,0),(3,1),(4,2),(5,3),(4,4)]

i - (d +2) =5 -6=-1

So, no elements are popped.

Then, row[5] = min_heap[0][0] + row[5] +1 =1 +1 +1=3

Push (3,5)

So, dp[5]=3

But according to the dp formula, dp[5] should be min(dp[4], dp[3], dp[2], dp[1]) + (a[5]+1) = min(4,5,4,3) +2=2 +2=4

But in the simulation, dp[5]=3, which is less than 4.

This suggests that the dp transition is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the dp[j] should not include the cost of placing a support at j.

Wait, let's rethink the dp definition.

Alternative approach:

dp[j] represents the minimal cost to reach position j, with a support placed at j.

Then, dp[j] = (a[j] +1) + min(dp[j -k] for k in 1 to d+1 if j -k >=0)

In the code, it seems to be implementing dp[j] = min(dp[j -k]) + (a[j] +1)

But in the simulation, row[j] is being updated to min_heap[0][0] + row[j] +1, where row[j] is a[j].

So, dp[j] = min(dp[j -k]) + (a[j] +1)

But in the simulation for j=5:

min(dp[j -k]) = min(dp[4], dp[3], dp[2], dp[1]) = min(4,5,4,3)=3

Then, dp[5] =3 + (1 +1)=5, but in simulation, dp[5]=3.

So, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the dp transition in the code.

Looking back at the code:

row[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] +1

Where row[i] is a[i], so row[i] +1 is a[i] +1.

Hence, dp[j] = min(dp[j -k]) + (a[j] +1)

But in the simulation, dp[5]=3, which would mean min(dp[j -k])=3 and a[5]+1=2, so dp[5]=3 +2=5, but in simulation, dp[5]=3.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Unless the min_heap[0][0] is not min(dp[j -k]), but something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to look into how the heap is being managed.

The heap contains (dp[j], j) for the last d positions.

But in the simulation, for j=5, min_heap[0][0]=1, which corresponds to dp[0]=1.

But dp[0] is not within the last d+1 positions relative to j=5.

Wait, d=4, so the window size is d=4.

Wait, in the code, it's i - (d +2), which is j - (d +2).

This seems off.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the heap management.

Looking back at the code:

while e := heappop(min_heap)[1] <= i - (d +2):

pass

This seems incorrect.

If d is the maximum distance between supports, then the window should be of size d+1.

So, the condition should be e[1] < i - d.

Because supports can be placed up to d cells apart, meaning the window for considering previous supports is the last d+1 positions.

Hence, the condition should be e[1] <= i - (d +1).

But in the code, it's e[1] <= i - (d +2), which is too conservative and might remove elements that are still within the window.

This could lead to incorrect minimum values being considered.

In the simulation above, for j=5, i - (d +2)=5 -6=-1, so no elements are removed.

Hence, min_heap[0][0]=1, which is dp[0]=1.

But dp[0] is not a valid previous support for j=5, because the distance is 4, which is within d=4.

Wait, distance between j=1 and j=5 is |5-1|-1=3 <=4, so it's acceptable.

But in reality, placing supports at j=1 and j=5 would be acceptable.

But dp[0]=1 is the cost up to j=1, which includes only the support at j=1.

To build upon j=5, the cost should be dp[4] + a[5] +1, but dp[4]=4.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Perhaps I need to adjust the window management in the heap.

I think the condition for removing elements from the heap should be e[1] <= i - (d +1), because supports can be placed up to d cells apart.

In other words, the previous support should be within the last d cells.

Hence, the window should be of size d+1.

So, the condition should be e[1] < i - d.

In the code, it's e[1] <= i - (d +2), which is incorrect.

This likely causes the heap to consider elements that are too far back, leading to invalid dp transitions.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

To fix it, the condition should be adjusted to ensure that only elements within the last d+1 positions are considered.

Therefore, the correct condition should be:

while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < i - d:

heappop(min_heap)

Then, dp[j] = min(dp[j -k] for k in 1 to d+1) + (a[j] +1)

This ensures that we only consider previous supports within the last d+1 positions.

In conclusion, the program is incorrect due to the flawed window management in the heap.

Correctness: **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost of installing supports for building k consecutive bridges on a river grid, adhering to specific constraints on support placement and distances.

### Approach

1. **Problem Breakdown**:
   - We are given a grid of size n rows and m columns representing the river.
   - We need to build k consecutive bridges on rows i to i+k-1.
   - Each bridge must have supports at both ends (columns 1 and m) and optionally at other columns within the specified distance constraint d.
   - The cost of installing a support at cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1.
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports should not exceed d.

2. **Dynamic Programming for Single Row**:
   - For each row, we use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost to place supports from the first column to the last column.
   - We maintain a sliding window of size d to ensure that the distance constraint is met.

3. **Sliding Window Minimum**:
   - We use a min-heap to efficiently track the minimum cost within the sliding window of size d.
   - This helps in achieving an efficient O(n*m) time complexity where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.

4. **Calculate Total Cost for k Consecutive Rows**:
   - For each row, compute the minimum support cost using the dynamic programming approach.
   - Sum the costs for every set of k consecutive rows and find the minimum sum among them.

### Solution Code

```python
import heapq

def func_1(row, d: int):
    m = len(row)
    dp = [float('inf')] * m
    dp[0] = 1  # Cost at the first column
    min_heap = [(dp[0], 0)]
    
    for j in range(1, m):
        # Remove elements from heap that are outside the window
        while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < j - d:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        # Calculate dp[j]
        dp[j] = min_heap[0][0] + row[j] + 1 if min_heap else row[j] + 1
        # Push the current dp[j] into the heap
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (dp[j], j))
    return dp[-1]

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        m = int(data[idx+1])
        k = int(data[idx+2])
        d = int(data[idx+3])
        idx += 4
        rows = []
        for _ in range(n):
            row = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+m]))
            rows.append(row)
            idx += m
        # Calculate the cost for each row
        costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
        # Find the minimum total cost for k consecutive rows
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i+k]) for i in range(n - k + 1)]
        print(min(total_costs))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Explanation

1. **func_1**:
   - Computes the minimum cost for a single row using dynamic programming.
   - Uses a sliding window minimum approach with a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost within the last d columns.

2. **func_2**:
   - Reads input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, reads the grid and computes the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - Computes the total cost for every set of k consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

This solution ensures that the support placement constraints are met while minimizing the total cost efficiently.
