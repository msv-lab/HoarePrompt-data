Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program is correct, I need to print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that even if the program works for most cases but fails for at least one, it should be considered incorrect.

I've been given three examples to understand how this works. Let's look at them one by one.

**Example 1:**

- Problem description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:

```python

def is_not_prime(n):

    if n < 2:

        return True

    for i in range(2, n):

        if n % i == 0:

            return True

    return False

```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **True**.

This seems straightforward. The function checks if a number is not prime by returning True if the number is less than 2 or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. Otherwise, it returns False. This aligns with the problem description.

**Example 2:**

- Problem description: Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with the same characters.

- Program:

```python

def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

    count = 0

    for i in range(len(s)-1):

        for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

            if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                count += 1

    return count

```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**.

I need to think about why this might be incorrect. The function seems to iterate through all possible substrings and count those that start and end with the same character. However, there might be an issue with the way it's counting. For instance, does it correctly handle single-character substrings? Wait, the problem says "substrings starting and ending with the same characters," which includes single-character substrings. But in the code, the inner loop runs from `i` to `len(s)-1`, and then it checks `s[i] == s[j+1]`, which seems to be checking the characters at positions `i` and `j+1`. This might not cover all possible substrings correctly. Maybe there's a better way to count these substrings, but without a clear understanding of the mistake, it's hard to say. The answer says it's False, so there must be a problem with this approach.

**Example 3:**

- Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- Program:

```python

def binary_search(arr, target):

    left = 0

    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:

        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:

            return mid

        elif arr[mid] < target:

            left = mid

        else:

            right = mid - 1

    if arr[left] == target:

        return left

    return -1

```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**.

Binary search is a classic algorithm, and there are known correct implementations. Looking at this code, there might be an issue with how the search space is being halved. In a standard binary search, when `arr[mid] < target`, we should set `left = mid + 1` to avoid an infinite loop. Here, it's set to `left = mid`, which could cause the loop to continue indefinitely if the target is not at mid. This is likely why it's considered incorrect.

Now, moving on to my task:

**Problem description:**

The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

**Input:**

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

**Output:**

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

**Example:**

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Output:

9

14

15

20

**Note:**

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5.

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for 5 burles.

**Program to verify:**

```python

def func():

    for i in range(int(input())):

        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())

        if B * 2 < C:

            print(A * B)

        elif A % 2 == 0:

            print(int(A * C / 2))

        else:

            X = A // 2

            print(X)

            print(X * C + B)

```

**My task:**

Determine if this program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying exactly n yogurts given the prices a and b for single and promotion purchases, respectively.

**Approach:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to buy exactly n yogurts.
   - We can buy them either individually at price a each or in pairs at price b.
   - We need to minimize the total cost.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - If buying two yogurts individually costs less than buying them as a promotion, i.e., 2*a < b, then it's better to buy all yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, it's better to buy as many pairs as possible at price b and buy the remaining yogurt(s) individually.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - n is odd: buy floor(n/2) pairs and one individual yogurt.
   - n is even: buy n/2 pairs.
   - Special case when n=1: only buy one yogurt.
   - Check if buying in pairs is beneficial or not.

4. **Analyze the Given Program:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases t.
   - For each test case, it reads n, a, and b.
   - If 2*b < a, it prints A * B. Wait, no. It says if B * 2 < C, print A * B. Hmm, that seems incorrect. Shouldn't it be if 2*a < b, then buy individually, else buy in pairs?
   - If A is even, it prints int(A * C / 2). This seems like buying A/2 pairs.
   - If A is odd, it calculates X = A // 2, prints X, then prints X * C + B. Wait, it's printing X, which is intermediate, and then the cost.

**Potential Issues:**

- The condition `if B * 2 < C:` seems incorrect. It should likely be `if 2 * A < B:` because B is the promotion price for two yogurts, and A is the individual price.
- When A is even, `print(int(A * C / 2))` seems correct if C is the promotion price for two yogurts.
- When A is odd, it calculates X = A // 2, which is the number of pairs, then prints X * C + B. But what is B in this context? B is the individual price, so it seems correct to buy X pairs and one individual yogurt.
- However, in the code, B is used as the individual price, which seems correct.
- But in the condition, it's checking B * 2 < C, which seems inverted. B is the promotion price for two yogurts, so 2*A is the cost of two individual yogurts. So, if 2*A < B, then buying individually is cheaper.

**Correction Needed:**

- The condition should be `if 2 * A < B:` instead of `if B * 2 < C:`.

**Modified Code:**

```python

def func():

    for i in range(int(input())):

        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())

        if 2 * B < C:

            print(A * B)

        elif A % 2 == 0:

            print(int(A * C / 2))

        else:

            X = A // 2

            print(X * C + B)

```

**Verification:**

Let's verify the original program with the example inputs:

**Test Case 1:**

- Input: 2 5 9

- According to the program:

  - A=2, B=5, C=9

  - Check if 5*2 < 9 → 10 < 9 → False

  - A is even, so print(int(2 * 9 / 2)) = int(9) = 9

  - Expected output: 9

- Correct.

**Test Case 2:**

- Input: 3 5 9

- According to the program:

  - A=3, B=5, C=9

  - Check if 5*2 < 9 → 10 < 9 → False

  - A is odd, so X=1, print(1 * 9 + 5) = 9 + 5 = 14

  - Expected output: 14

- Correct.

**Test Case 3:**

- Input: 3 5 11

- According to the program:

  - A=3, B=5, C=11

  - Check if 5*2 < 11 → 10 < 11 → True

  - So, print(A * B) = 3 * 5 = 15

  - Expected output: 15

- Correct.

**Test Case 4:**

- Input: 4 5 11

- According to the program:

  - A=4, B=5, C=11

  - Check if 5*2 < 11 → 10 < 11 → True

  - So, print(A * B) = 4 * 5 = 20

  - Expected output: 20

- Correct.

**But wait:**

In the note, it says for the third test case, it's more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5, which would be 11 + 5 = 16, so 15 is better.

But according to the program, since 2*5 < 11 is False (10 < 11 is False), it would go to the else clause.

Wait, in the original program, it's `if B * 2 < C:`, which is `if 5*2 < 11:`, which is `10 < 11`, which is True, so it would print A*B = 3*5 = 15, which matches the expected output.

But according to the corrected condition `if 2*A < B:`, which is `if 2*5 < 5:`, which is `10 < 5`, which is False, so it would go to the next clause.

Wait, there's confusion here.

Let me re-examine.

In the original program:

- condition: `if B * 2 < C:`

- which is `if promotion_price * 2 < individual_price:`

- This seems inverted.

Wait, B is the individual price, and C is the promotion price for two yogurts.

So, B = individual price, C = promotion price for two.

So, the condition should be:

- If 2 * B < C, then buying individually is cheaper.

- Else, buying in pairs is better.

So, the original condition `if B * 2 < C:` is correct.

Wait, but in the note, for the third test case, buying three individually would cost 15, and buying two for 11 and one for 5 would cost 16, so buying three individually is better.

But according to the condition, if 2*B < C, which is 2*5 < 11 → 10 < 11 → True, so buy individually, which matches the expected output of 15.

So, in this case, it's correct.

But let's consider another case where 2*B > C.

For example, n=2, a=5, b=8.

- 2*a = 10 > b=8, so buying in pairs is better.

- So, for n=2, cost should be b=8.

- According to the program:

  - A=2, B=5, C=8

  - Check if 5*2 < 8 → 10 < 8 → False

  - A is even, so print(int(2*8/2)) = int(8) = 8

  - Correct.

Another case: n=3, a=5, b=8.

- 2*a=10 > b=8

- So, buy one pair for b=8 and one individual for a=5, total 13.

- According to the program:

  - A=3, B=5, C=8

  - Check if 5*2 < 8 → 10 < 8 → False

  - A is odd, so X=1, print(X*C + B) = 1*8 + 5 = 13

  - Correct.

Another case: n=4, a=5, b=8.

- 2*a=10 > b=8

- Buy two pairs for 2*b=16

- According to the program:

  - A=4, B=5, C=8

  - Check if 5*2 < 8 → 10 < 8 → False

  - A is even, so print(int(4*8/2)) = int(16) = 16

  - Correct.

Another case: n=1, a=5, b=8.

- Only buy one individually for a=5.

- According to the program:

  - A=1, B=5, C=8

  - Check if 5*2 < 8 → 10 < 8 → False

  - A is odd, so X=0, print(X*C + B) = 0*8 + 5 = 5

  - Correct.

Seems like the condition `if B * 2 < C:` is correct, where B is the individual price and C is the promotion price for two.

So, in the original program, the condition is correct.

But in my earlier analysis, I thought it should be `if 2*A < B:`, but that would be incorrect because A is the individual price and B is the promotion price for two.

Wait, no. Looking back at the problem, it says:

- The price of one yogurt is a burles.

- Promotion: buy two yogurts for b burles.

So, in the program, A is n, B is a, C is b.

So, B is the individual price a, and C is the promotion price b for two yogurts.

Therefore, the condition `if B * 2 < C:` is correct because it checks if buying two individually is cheaper than buying them as a pair.

If 2*B < C, then it's better to buy individually; else, buy in pairs.

So, in the program:

- If 2*B < C, print(A * B)

- Else if A is even, print(int(A * C / 2))

- Else, print(int(A // 2 * C + B))

This seems correct.

But in the original program, in the else clause, it prints X and then X * C + B, where X = A // 2.

Wait, but in the original program, it prints X, which is intermediate, and then X * C + B.

This is likely a mistake because it should only print the final cost, not the intermediate value X.

In the example outputs, only the final cost is printed, not X.

So, the original program is incorrectly printing X in addition to the final cost when A is odd.

This could be a typo or debugging statement left in the code.

If we remove the print(X) statement, the program would be correct.

But as it is, with the extra print(X), it's incorrect because it prints an extra line.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{False}} \]
