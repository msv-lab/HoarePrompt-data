Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to help Rudolf minimize the cost of building k bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid, considering the depths of the cells and the constraints on the distance between supports.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. The river is represented as an n x m grid, where each cell has a depth a_{i,j}. The first and last columns have depths of 0, representing the river banks. Rudolf wants to build k bridges on consecutive rows, and for each bridge, he needs to install supports in certain cells to satisfy specific conditions:

1. A support must be installed in the first and last cells of the row (columns 1 and m).

2. The distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d, where distance is defined as |j1 - j2| - 1.

The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing these supports across all k bridges.

The program provided consists of two main functions: func_1 and func_2. Func_2 seems to handle the input and overall logic, while func_1 appears to calculate the cost for a single row.

Let's break this down step by step.

First, func_2 reads the input values: t (number of test cases), n (number of rows), m (number of columns), k (number of consecutive rows for bridges), and d (maximum distance between supports). It then reads the grid of depths for n rows and m columns.

For each test case, it calls func_1 for each row to calculate the cost of building a bridge on that row, stores these costs in a list called costs, and then calculates the total cost for each possible sequence of k consecutive rows, finally printing the minimum of these total costs.

Now, the critical part is func_1, which calculates the cost for a single row. This function seems to implement some sort of dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost of placing supports in the row, given the constraints.

Let's look at func_1 in detail:

def func_1(row, d: int):

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

This function modifies the input row in place. It sets row[0] to 1, which seems to account for the support at the first cell. Then, for the next d-1 cells, it sets their values to row[i] + 2. I'm not entirely sure why it's adding 2; according to the problem, the cost of installing a support in cell (i,j) is a_{i,j} + 1, so maybe this is accounting for that.

Then, it creates a min_heap with the first d elements, heapifies it, and iterates from the d-th cell to the end of the row. In this loop, it pops elements from the heap until it finds one that is not too old (i.e., its index is not less than or equal to i - (d + 2)). It then calculates the cost for the current cell as the popped element's cost plus the current cell's value plus 1, pushes the popped element back into the heap, and pushes the new cost for the current cell into the heap.

Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell.

This seems to be implementing a sliding window minimum approach to keep track of the minimum cost within a window of size d, but I need to verify if this correctly models the problem constraints.

Let me think about the problem again. For each row, we need to place supports such that:

1. Supports are placed at the first and last cells.

2. The distance between any two adjacent supports is at most d-1.

The cost of each support at cell j is a_{i,j} + 1.

We need to find the minimum cost for placing supports in this row under these constraints.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem where we keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell, considering the allowed distance between supports.

In dynamic programming terms, let's define dp[j] as the minimum cost to build the bridge up to cell j, including a support at cell j.

The recurrence relation would be:

dp[j] = min(dp[i]) + a_{i,j} + 1 for all i such that j - i - 1 <= d and i <= j - 1, and i = 0 is allowed.

Wait, more precisely:

- We must have a support at j = 0 and j = m-1.

- Between j = 0 and j = m-1, supports can be placed at any cells, but the distance between any two consecutive supports must be at most d.

So, to model this, we can think of dp[j] as the minimum cost to build the bridge up to and including cell j, with a support at j.

Then, dp[j] = min(dp[i]) + a_{i,j} + 1 for all i such that j - i - 1 <= d and i >= 0.

Wait, but i should be less than j, because we're building from left to right.

Wait, actually, in the code, it seems to be iterating from left to right, and maintaining a sliding window of size d to keep track of the minimum dp[i] within that window.

Let me see:

In the code, row[i] is being updated to include the cost of placing a support at i, considering the minimum cost from previous supports within d distance.

So, row[i] = minimum of (row[i - k] for k in 0 to d) + a_{i} + 1.

Wait, but in the code, it's row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1, where e[0] is the minimum dp[i] in the window.

This seems correct.

Then, for each row, func_1 calculates the minimum cost to place supports from the start to the end, considering the constraints.

After that, func_2 calculates the total cost for each sequence of k consecutive rows and selects the minimum among them.

Looking at the examples provided:

In Example 1, the program is correct because it identifies non-prime numbers correctly.

In Example 2, the program is incorrect because it doesn't count all substrings starting and ending with the same character correctly.

In Example 3, the binary search program is incorrect, possibly because it doesn't handle the search correctly.

For this task, I need to ensure that the given program correctly implements the solution as per the problem description.

Given that, I need to think about whether the program correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows, considering the constraints on support placement.

Looking back at func_1, it seems to correctly model the dynamic programming approach for each row. It maintains a sliding window of size d to consider the previous supports within the allowed distance.

However, I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me consider a simple test case.

Test case:

n = 1, m = 4, k = 1, d = 1

Row: [0, 1, 2, 0]

According to the problem, supports must be placed at j=0 and j=3.

The distance between supports must be <=1.

So, possible placements:

- Supports at j=0 and j=3.

Distance between them is |3-0|-1 = 2, which is >1, so this is invalid.

Therefore, we need to place at least one more support in between.

Possible placements:

- j=0, j=2, j=3

Distance between j=0 and j=2 is 1, which is <=1

Distance between j=2 and j=3 is 0, which is <=1

Cost: (0+1) + (2+1) + (0+1) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

- j=0, j=1, j=3

Distance between j=0 and j=1 is 0, which is <=1

Distance between j=1 and j=3 is 1, which is <=1

Cost: (0+1) + (1+1) + (0+1) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

So, the minimum cost is 4.

Now, let's see what func_1 would return for this row.

Initialize row: [0,1,2,0]

Set row[0] = 1

Then, for i in range(1,1): # since d=1, this loop doesn't run

min_heap is empty

Then, for i in range(1,4):

i=1:

while e = heappop(min_heap): # min_heap is empty, so this loop doesn't run

row[1] = e[0] + row[1] +1 # but min_heap is empty, so this is an error

Wait, actually, for d=1, the min_heap is initialized with row[0:1], which is [(1,0)]

heapify(min_heap) makes it a heap with (1,0)

Then, for i=1:

while e = (1,0), and e[1] <= 1 - (1+2) = -2: which is not true, so don't pop

So, row[1] = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Push back (1,0) and (3,1) into the heap

Then, for i=2:

while e = (1,0), and e[1] <= 2 - (1+2) = -1: not true, so don't pop

row[2] = 1 + 2 +1 = 4

Push back (1,0) and (4,2)

Then, for i=3:

while e = (1,0), and e[1] <= 3 - (1+2) = 0: which is true, so pop (1,0)

Next e = (3,1), e[1] <= 3 - (1+2) = 0: 1 <= 0? False, so stop

row[3] = 3 + 0 +1 = 4

Push back (3,1) and (4,3)

So, the final row is [1,3,4,4], and row[-1] = 4, which matches the minimum cost of 4.

Good, this seems correct for this test case.

Another test case:

n=1, m=5, k=1, d=2

Row: [0,1,2,3,0]

Possible placements:

- j=0, j=2, j=4

Distance between j=0 and j=2 is 1 <=2

Distance between j=2 and j=4 is 1 <=2

Cost: (0+1) + (2+1) + (0+1) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

- j=0, j=3, j=4

Distance between j=0 and j=3 is 2 <=2

Distance between j=3 and j=4 is 0 <=2

Cost: 1 + 4 +1 = 6

- j=0, j=1, j=4

Distance between j=0 and j=1 is 0 <=2

Distance between j=1 and j=4 is 2 <=2

Cost: 1 + 2 +1 = 4

- j=0, j=1, j=3, j=4

Cost: 1 + 2 +4 +1 = 8, which is higher

So, minimum cost is 4.

Let's see what func_1 does:

row = [0,1,2,3,0]

Set row[0] =1

for i in range(1,2): # d=2

row[1] = row[1] +2 = 3

min_heap = [(3,1), (1,0)]

Then, for i=2:

while e=(1,0), e[1] <=2 - (2+2) = -2: False

row[2] = min_heap[0][0] + row[2] +1 =1 +2 +1 =4

push back (1,0) and (4,2)

Then, for i=3:

while e=(1,0), e[1] <=3 - (2+2) = -1: False

row[3] =1 +3 +1 =5

push back (1,0) and (5,3)

Then, for i=4:

while e=(1,0), e[1] <=4 - (2+2)=0: True, pop (1,0)

next e=(3,1), e[1] <=4 - (2+2)=0: 1 <=0? False

row[4] =3 +0 +1=4

push back (3,1) and (4,4)

So, row[-1]=4, which matches the minimum cost of 4.

Good.

Another test case:

n=1, m=6, k=1, d=3

Row: [0,1,2,3,4,0]

Possible placements:

- j=0, j=3, j=5

Distance between j=0 and j=3 is 2 <=3

Distance between j=3 and j=5 is 1 <=3

Cost:1 +4 +1=6

- j=0, j=2, j=5

Distance between j=0 and j=2 is 1 <=3

Distance between j=2 and j=5 is 2 <=3

Cost:1 +3 +1=5

- j=0, j=1, j=5

Distance between j=0 and j=1 is 0 <=3

Distance between j=1 and j=5 is 3 <=3

Cost:1 +2 +1=4

- j=0, j=1, j=4, j=5

Cost:1 +2 +5 +1=9, which is higher

So, minimum cost is 4.

Let's see func_1:

row=[0,1,2,3,4,0]

Set row[0]=1

for i in range(1,3): #d=3

row[1]=1+2=3

row[2]=2+2=4

min_heap=[(3,1),(4,2),(1,0)]

Then, for i=3:

while e=(1,0), e[1]<=3-(3+2)=-2: False

row[3]=min_heap[0][0]+3+1=3+3+1=7

push back (3,1) and (7,3)

Then, for i=4:

while e=(3,1), e[1]<=4-(3+2)=-1: False

row[4]=3+4+1=8

push back (3,1) and (8,4)

Then, for i=5:

while e=(3,1), e[1]<=5-(3+2)=0: True, pop (3,1)

next e=(4,2), e[1]<=0: 2<=0? False

row[5]=4+0+1=5

push back (4,2) and (5,5)

So, row[-1]=5, but the expected minimum cost is 4. Hmm, seems there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Let's recalculate the possible placements.

- j=0, j=1, j=5: cost=1+2+1=4

- j=0, j=2, j=5: cost=1+3+1=5

- j=0, j=3, j=5: cost=1+4+1=6

So, minimum is indeed 4, but func_1 returns 5.

This suggests that func_1 is not correctly calculating the minimum cost.

What's happening in func_1:

- It's keeping a sliding window of size d=3, but perhaps it's not considering the correct previous support within the window.

Looking back at the code:

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):

pass

row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

heappush(min_heap, e)

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

In this test case, for i=5:

- min_heap initially contains (3,1), (4,2), (5,5)

- i=5

- while e=(3,1), e[1]=1 <= 5 - (3+2)=0: True, so pop (3,1)

- next e=(4,2), e[1]=2 <=0? False, so stop

- row[5] =4 +0 +1=5

Which is higher than the expected minimum cost of 4.

So, it seems that the function is not correctly handling this case.

Wait, perhaps the condition in the while loop is incorrect.

The condition is while e[1] <= i - (d + 2):

Let's see what i - (d + 2) is for i=5, d=3: 5 - 5 =0

So, e[1] <=0 means we pop elements with e[1] <=0.

In this case, e=(3,1), e[1]=1 <=0? No, but it's comparing e[1]=1 <=0, which is False, so it stops.

Wait, in the earlier step, for i=5, min_heap contains (3,1), (4,2), (8,4)

When i=5, d=3, i - (d + 2) =5 -5=0

So, e=(3,1), e[1]=1 <=0? False, so don't pop.

Hence, row[5]=3 +0 +1=4, not 5.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had min_heap as (3,1), (4,2), (5,5), but that might be incorrect.

Let me recast the steps:

Initialize row: [0,1,2,3,4,0]

Set row[0]=1

for i in range(1,3):

row[1]=1+2=3

row[2]=2+2=4

min_heap=[(3,1),(4,2),(1,0)]

Then, for i=3:

while e=(1,0), e[1]=0 <=3-5=-2: False

row[3]=3 +3 +1=7

push back (3,1) and (7,3)

Now, min_heap is [(3,1), (4,2), (7,3)]

Then, for i=4:

while e=(3,1), e[1]=1 <=4-5=-1: False

row[4]=3 +4 +1=8

push back (3,1) and (8,4)

min_heap is [(3,1), (4,2), (7,3), (8,4)]

Then, for i=5:

while e=(3,1), e[1]=1 <=5-5=0: True, pop (3,1)

next e=(4,2), e[1]=2 <=0? False

So, row[5]=4 +0 +1=5

Hence, row[-1]=5, but the expected minimum is 4.

So, it seems that the function is not correctly calculating the minimum cost.

Looking back, perhaps the issue is that the heap is not correctly maintaining the minimum within the allowed window.

In the last step, for i=5, it should consider the minimum from the window that includes i=2 to i=5-1=4, but with distance constraints.

Wait, perhaps the condition for popping elements from the heap is incorrect.

The condition is e[1] <= i - (d + 2), which for d=3 and i=5 is e[1] <=0.

But e[1] is the column index, which starts from 0.

In this case, e=(3,1), e[1]=1 >0, so it gets popped.

Then, e=(4,2), but e[1]=2 >0, so it shouldn't be popped.

Wait, but according to the condition, e[1] <=0, which is False for e[1]=2, so it stops popping.

Hence, row[5]=4 +0 +1=5, which is higher than the expected minimum cost of 4.

So, perhaps the formula for popping elements is incorrect.

Maybe it should be e[1] <= i - d -1, or something similar.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps a better approach is to use a sliding window of size d, and keep track of the minimum dp[i] within that window.

In standard sliding window minimum problems, we maintain a deque to keep track of the indices in the window in decreasing order of their dp values.

But in this code, it's using a heap to keep track of the minimum dp[i] in the window.

However, heaps don't maintain any order based on indices, so when we pop elements, we might be getting an element that is outside the window.

Perhaps I need to adjust the condition for popping elements to ensure that only elements within the window are considered.

Let me try to adjust the condition.

Instead of e[1] <= i - (d + 2), perhaps it should be e[1] <= i - d.

Wait, let's think about it.

The window for i is from i - d to i - 1.

So, the previous support can be from i - d to i - 1.

Hence, when considering the minimum dp[i] in this window, I need to ensure that the heap only contains elements from this window.

Therefore, the condition for popping should be e[1] < i - d.

In code, while e[1] < i - d:

pop e

Then, row[i] = e[0] + row[i] +1, where e is the minimum in the window.

Then, push e back and push (row[i], i).

Wait, but actually, in a standard sliding window minimum, we don't push e back after popping.

We need to maintain the heap with elements from the current window.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Initialize min_heap with elements from row[0] to row[d-1]

- For each i from d to m-1:

while min_heap[0][1] < i - d:

heappop(min_heap)

row[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] +1

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

This way, the heap always contains elements within the window of size d.

In the earlier code, it's pushing back e after calculating row[i], which might be incorrect.

Let me adjust func_1 accordingly.

def func_1(row, d: int):

row[0] = 1

for i in range(1, d):

row[i] = row[i] + 2

min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]

heapify(min_heap)

for i in range(d, len(row)):

while min_heap[0][1] < i - d:

heappop(min_heap)

row[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] +1

heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))

return row[-1]

Now, let's re-run the previous test case with n=1, m=6, k=1, d=3

row = [0,1,2,3,4,0]

Set row[0]=1

for i in range(1,3):

row[1]=1+2=3

row[2]=2+2=4

min_heap=[(3,1),(4,2),(1,0)]

Then, for i=3:

while min_heap[0][1]=0 <3-3=0: False

row[3]=1 +3 +1=5

push (5,3)

Then, for i=4:

while min_heap[0][1]=0 <4-3=1: True, pop (1,0)

now min_heap=[(3,1),(4,2),(5,3)]

row[4]=3 +4 +1=8

push (8,4)

Then, for i=5:

while min_heap[0][1]=1 <5-3=2: False

row[5]=3 +0 +1=4

push (4,5)

So, row[-1]=4, which matches the expected minimum cost of 4.

Great, this seems correct now.

Therefore, the original func_1 had an incorrect condition for popping elements from the heap, leading to potential inclusion of outdated elements in the cost calculation.

By adjusting the condition to while min_heap[0][1] < i - d:, we ensure that only elements within the sliding window are considered when calculating the minimum cost.

This should correctly model the problem constraints and provide the minimum cost for each row.

Given this correction, I need to consider whether the provided program is correct or not.

Since the original func_1 had an incorrect condition for popping elements from the heap, which could lead to incorrect cost calculations in certain cases, the program is not correct as is.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

However, with the adjusted condition in func_1, the program would be correct.

But based on the provided code, which has the incorrect condition, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to minimize the cost of building k bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid, considering the depths of the cells and constraints on the distance between supports.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We have a grid of size n x m representing the river depth.
   - We need to build k bridges on consecutive rows.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports should not exceed d.

2. **Insight**:
   - For each row, calculate the minimum cost to place supports from the start to the end, considering the constraints.
   - Use a sliding window approach to keep track of the minimum cost within the allowed distance d.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Use dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost for each row.
   - Utilize a min-heap to efficiently manage and update the costs within the sliding window.

4. **Complexity**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n * m * log m) due to heap operations within the sliding window.
   - Space Complexity: O(m) for storing the row costs.

### Solution Code

```python
import heapq

def func_1(row, d: int):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
    min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapq.heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while min_heap[0][1] < i - d:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        row[i] = min_heap[0][0] + row[i] + 1
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
    return row[-1]

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        m = int(data[idx + 1])
        k = int(data[idx + 2])
        d = int(data[idx + 3])
        idx += 4
        rows = []
        for _ in range(n):
            row = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + m]))
            rows.append(row)
            idx += m
        costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(n - k + 1)]
        results.append(str(min(total_costs)))
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Explanation

1. **func_1**:
   - Initializes the first cell cost.
   - Uses a sliding window approach with a min-heap to compute the minimum cost for each cell in the row.
   - Ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed d.

2. **func_2**:
   - Reads input values for multiple test cases.
   - Computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - Calculates the total cost for each sequence of k consecutive rows and selects the minimum total cost.

3. **Optimization**:
   - The sliding window with a min-heap efficiently manages the dynamic programming states, ensuring that only relevant previous states are considered.

This solution ensures that the constraints are met while minimizing the total cost of building the bridges.
