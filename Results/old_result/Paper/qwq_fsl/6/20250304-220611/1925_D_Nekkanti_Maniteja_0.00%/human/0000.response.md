Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program is correct, I need to print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partially correct programs are considered incorrect. I need to ensure that the program meets the requirements for every potential case as described in the problem.

Let's first understand the problem description and the provided program to see if they align correctly.

### Problem Description

There are `n` children in a class, and `m` pairs among them are friends, each with a friendship value `f_i`. The teacher goes on `k` excursions, and for each excursion, she chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably, and independently. If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is 0 and doesn't change. We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). The answer should be expressed as `p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7)`.

### Provided Program

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are `n` children, `m` friend pairs with friendship values.
   - `k` excursions where a pair is chosen randomly each time.
   - If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
   - Need to find the expected sum of friendship values at the time of choice for each of the `k` excursions.

2. **Key Points:**
   - Pairs are chosen randomly and independently.
   - Friendship values increase over time for friend pairs.
   - Non-friend pairs have a friendship value of 0, which never changes.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The total number of possible pairs is `n choose 2`, which is `n*(n-1)/2`.
   - Each pair is chosen with equal probability, so the probability of choosing any specific pair is `2 / (n*(n-1))` (since order doesn't matter in pairs).
   - For friend pairs, their friendship value increases by 1 after each time they are chosen.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values for each of the `k` choices.
   - This involves calculating the expected friendship value for each chosen pair at the time of choice and summing them up.

5. **Program Logic:**
   - Read `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `m`, `k`.
   - Compute `c = (n*(n-1)//1)^-1 mod M`, where `M = 10^9 + 7`.
   - Sum up the friendship values `a` of all friend pairs.
   - For each excursion `i` from 0 to `k-1`, add to `s`: `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - Print `s % M`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Computation of `c`:**
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`
   - `n * (n - 1) // 1` is equivalent to `n * (n - 1)`, which is the total number of pairs times 2 (since `n choose 2` is `n*(n-1)/2`).
   - But in the program, it's `//1`, which doesn't change the value.
   - The modular inverse is computed correctly.

2. **Summing up `a`:**
   - `a` is the sum of friendship values of all friend pairs.
   - This seems correct.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected sum `s` is calculated in a loop for `k` excursions.
   - The expression `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is used.
   - This seems suspicious because it's not clear how this relates to the expected sum of friendship values.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - All operations are performed modulo `M`, which is correct for preventing overflow.

5. **Independence of Choices:**
   - Since choices are independent, the friendship values can increase over time, affecting future choices.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to model the expected increase in friendship values over the `k` excursions.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Let `p = 2 / (n*(n-1))` be the probability of choosing any specific pair.
   - For each friend pair `(u, v)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected number of times it is chosen in `k` excursions is `k * p`.
   - However, since the friendship value increases by 1 each time it is chosen, the expected friendship value after `k` excursions is `f + (number of times chosen)`.

2. **Expected Sum Calculation:**
   - For each friend pair, the expected contribution to the sum is the sum of its friendship value at each choice time.
   - This requires careful calculation of the expected value for each friend pair and summing them up.

3. **Non-friend Pairs:**
   - Their friendship value is always 0 and doesn't change.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided program seems too simplistic and likely incorrect.

### Counterexample

Let's consider a simple test case to see if the program works correctly.

**Test Case:**

- `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`

- Friend pair: `(1, 2)` with `f = 1`

**Expected Output:**

- There are only 2 children, so only one possible pair: `(1, 2)`.

- Probability of choosing this pair is 1 (since there's only one pair).

- Friendship value at the time of choice is 1.

- So, the expected sum is 1.

**Program Output:**

- Compute `c = pow(2*1 //1, -1, 10**9+7) = pow(2, -1, 10**9+7) = 500000004`

- `a = 1`

- For `k=1`: `s = 0 + 500000004*0*500000004*1 + 500000004*1 = 500000004`

- `s % M = 500000004`

- But expected output is 1.

This shows a discrepancy, indicating the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected sum of friendship values as per the problem description. Hence, the correctness is **False**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
