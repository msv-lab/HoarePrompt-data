Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". It's important to note that partial correctness isn't accepted; the program must handle every potential case correctly to be considered correct.

I've been given three examples to understand how this works. Let's look at them one by one.

**Example 1:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:

```python

def is_not_prime(n):

    if n < 2:

        return True

    for i in range(2, n):

        if n % i == 0:

            return True

    return False

```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **True**.

Okay, so in this example, the function is supposed to identify non-prime numbers. It returns True if the number is not prime and False if it is prime. The logic seems straightforward: if the number is less than 2, it's not prime. Then, it checks if any number from 2 to n-1 divides n evenly. If it finds such a divisor, it returns True, indicating it's not prime. Otherwise, it returns False.

I need to think about whether this covers all cases correctly. For n less than 2, it's correct because primes are greater than or equal to 2. For n >= 2, it checks for divisors properly. I don't see any issues here. So, Correctness: **True**.

**Example 2:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with the same characters.

- Program:

```python

def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

    count = 0

    for i in range(len(s)-1):

        for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

            if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                count += 1

    return count

```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**.

Hmm, in this example, the function is supposed to count substrings that start and end with the same character. Let's see what the code does.

It uses two nested loops: the outer loop runs from the first character to the second-to-last character, and the inner loop runs from the current outer loop index to the second-to-last character. It then checks if the character at the outer loop index matches the character at j+1 and increments the count if they match.

Wait a minute, this seems incorrect. The inner loop is going up to len(s)-1, and j+1 would go up to len(s), which is fine. But, the way it's counting, it's only checking pairs where the starting character matches the ending character of the substring. However, substrings can be of any length, and this seems to be missing some cases.

For example, consider the string "abc". Substrings are:

- a, ab, abc

- b, bc

- c

According to the problem, we need to count substrings that start and end with the same character. So, "a", "b", "c" all qualify because they are single characters. "ab" starts with 'a' and ends with 'b' – doesn't qualify. "bc" starts with 'b' and ends with 'c' – doesn't qualify. "abc" starts with 'a' and ends with 'c' – doesn't qualify.

So, only "a", "b", and "c" qualify, which means the count should be 3.

Now, let's see what the function does for "abc":

- i=0:

- j=0: s[0] == s[1] → 'a' == 'b' → False

- j=1: s[0] == s[2] → 'a' == 'c' → False

- i=1:

- j=1: s[1] == s[2] → 'b' == 'c' → False

- i=2: inner loop doesn't run because j goes up to len(s)-1=2, and i=2 would make j=2, j+1=3 which is out of bounds.

So, count remains 0, which is incorrect because it should be 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case. Hence, Correctness: **False**.

**Example 3:**

- Problem Description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- Program:

```python

def binary_search(arr, target):

    left = 0

    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:

        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:

            return mid

        elif arr[mid] < target:

            left = mid

        else:

            right = mid - 1

    if arr[left] == target:

        return left

    return -1

```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**.

This is a binary search function. Binary search requires the list to be sorted, but it's not mentioned in the problem description whether the list is sorted or not. Assuming the list is sorted, let's see if this function works correctly.

Looking at the code:

- It initializes left to 0 and right to the last index.

- In the while loop, it continues as long as left < right.

- It calculates the mid index.

- If arr[mid] == target, it returns mid.

- If arr[mid] < target, it sets left to mid.

- If arr[mid] > target, it sets right to mid - 1.

- After the loop, it checks if arr[left] == target and returns left, else -1.

There's a potential issue here. In binary search, when arr[mid] < target, we should set left = mid + 1. Here, it's set to left = mid, which could lead to an infinite loop if the target is not at mid but between mid and right.

Let's consider an example:

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 3

Initial: left=0, right=4, mid=2 (arr[2]=3)

Since arr[2] == 3, it returns 2. Correct.

Another example: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 6

left=0, right=4, mid=2 (arr[2]=3 < 6), so left = 2

Now, left=2, right=4, mid=3 (arr[3]=4 < 6), so left=3

Now, left=3, right=4, mid=3 (arr[3]=4 < 6), so left=3

Now, left=3, right=4, mid=3 (arr[3]=4 < 6), so left=3

This continues infinitely if arr[4] != 6. So, it's incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**.

Now, moving on to my task:

**Problem Description:**

Bob has a rectangle of size a × b. He tries to cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90° rotation, they are considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6×4 and 4×6 are considered the same.

Thus, from the 2×6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because it can be cut into two 2×3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles can be used to form the 4×3 rectangle, which is different from the 2×6 rectangle.

However, from the 2×1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed, because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1×1, and from these, only the 1×2 and 2×1 rectangles can be formed, which are considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just wasting his time.

Input:

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output:

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the a×b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example:

Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

**Program:**

```python

for _ in range(int(input())):

    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())

    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):

    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'

```

Alright, so I need to verify if this program correctly solves the problem as described. The program reads multiple test cases, each with two integers a and b, and for each, it calls func_1(a, b) and prints 'yes' if b is even, otherwise 'no'.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly.

**Understanding the Problem:**

- Bob has a rectangle of size a × b.

- He makes a single cut parallel to one of its sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

- He then tries to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles, possibly rotating them.

- The new rectangle should be different from the original one, considering that rotations don't create distinct rectangles (e.g., 6×4 and 4×6 are the same).

- Determine if it's possible to form such a new rectangle.

**Approach to Verification:**

1. **Understand the possible cuts:**

- Cut parallel to the shorter side:

- If cutting parallel to side a, the cut is along side b, dividing b into two parts, say b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

- Similarly, cutting parallel to side b divides a into two parts.

2. **Forming new rectangles:**

- After cutting, we have two smaller rectangles. We need to see if these two can be arranged (possibly rotated) to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

3. **Considerations:**

- The new rectangle should not be the same as the original one, even after rotation.

- We need to check all possible ways of cutting and arranging the pieces.

**Analyzing the Given Program:**

The program simply checks if b is even. If b is even, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, 'no'. Similarly, it could have checked a instead of b, but it specifically checks b.

From the example outputs:

- For (1,1): No

- (2,1): No

- (2,6): Yes

- (3,2): Yes

- (2,2): Yes

- (2,4): Yes

- (6,3): No

According to the program:

- For (1,1): b=1 is odd → 'no' (correct)

- (2,1): b=1 is odd → 'no' (correct)

- (2,6): b=6 is even → 'yes' (correct)

- (3,2): b=2 is even → 'yes' (correct)

- (2,2): b=2 is even → 'yes' (correct)

- (2,4): b=4 is even → 'yes' (correct)

- (6,3): b=3 is odd → 'no' (correct)

So, for these examples, it seems correct. But I need to verify if this logic holds generally.

**General Case Analysis:**

Let's think about the condition b % 2 == 0.

Is it always true that if b is even, Bob can form another rectangle, and if b is odd, he cannot?

Wait, in the program, it checks if b is even, but in the problem, a and b are symmetric in the sense that the rectangle is a×b, and cuts can be made parallel to either side.

Perhaps the condition should involve both a and b.

**Deeper Analysis:**

Let's consider the possible cuts:

1. **Cut parallel to side a:**

- Divide side b into b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

- The two resulting rectangles are a×b1 and a×b2.

- To form a new rectangle from these two, we can place them side by side either horizontally or vertically.

- If placed side by side horizontally, the new rectangle would have sides (a + a) × max(b1, b2), but since we can rotate, maybe other configurations are possible.

Wait, actually, since we can rotate the smaller rectangles, the possibilities increase.

2. **Cut parallel to side b:**

- Divide side a into a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = a.

- The two resulting rectangles are a1×b and a2×b.

- Similarly, we can arrange these to form a new rectangle.

The key is to see if the two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle that is different from the original one, considering the rotation equivalence.

**Looking for a General Condition:**

From the examples:

- (2,6): Can be cut into two 2×3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4×3 rectangle, which is different from 2×6.

- (3,2): Can be cut into two 3×1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1×6 rectangle, which is the same as 2×3, but in this case, 1×6 and 2×3 are considered different from 3×2.

Wait, but according to the note, 6×4 and 4×6 are considered the same.

Wait, in the note, it says that rotations don't create distinct rectangles, but in the example, 2×6 and 4×3 are considered different.

Wait, no, in the first example, from 2×6, they form 4×3, which is different from 2×6 and 6×2.

But according to the note, 4×3 and 3×4 are considered the same.

So, 2×6, 6×2, 4×3, and 3×4 are all considered distinct because their dimensions are different and rotations are considered the same.

Wait, I need to clarify the equivalence classes.

- 2×6 and 6×2 are considered the same.

- 4×3 and 3×4 are considered the same.

- But 2×6 and 4×3 are different because one cannot be obtained from the other by rotation.

So, in the problem, we need to check if we can form a new rectangle that is not in the same equivalence class as the original.

**Back to the Program's Logic:**

The program only checks if b is even. If b is even, it says 'yes'; else, 'no'.

Is this a correct condition?

Let me think about it.

Suppose b is even. Then, b can be divided into two equal parts, each of size b/2.

So, cutting parallel to side a, we get two rectangles of size a×(b/2).

Then, we can arrange these two rectangles side by side horizontally to get a rectangle of size (a + a)×(b/2) = 2a × (b/2).

But 2a × (b/2) is the same as a × b, which is the original rectangle.

So, no new rectangle is formed.

Wait, but in the example, they cut the 2×6 into two 2×3 rectangles and arrange them to form a 4×3 rectangle, which is different from 2×6.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways to arrange the pieces.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating one of the pieces.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider all possible ways of arranging the two smaller rectangles.

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical condition based on a and b.

**Looking for a Mathematical Condition:**

Let me consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

If GCD(a, b) = 1, then a and b are co-prime, and perhaps no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but in the example, (2,1): GCD(2,1)=1, and the output is 'No'.

Similarly, (2,2): GCD(2,2)=2, output 'Yes'.

(2,4): GCD(2,4)=2, 'Yes'.

(3,2): GCD(3,2)=1, 'Yes'.

Wait, but according to the program, for b even, 'Yes', which matches the outputs except for (3,2), where b=2 is even, and output is 'Yes'.

Wait, but according to the program, for b even, it's 'Yes', which matches the outputs.

But in (3,2), b=2 is even, and output is 'Yes', which seems correct.

But is this always true?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if b is even, then it can be divided into two equal parts, and perhaps those can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

But in the earlier thought, 2×6 cut into two 2×3, which can be arranged into 4×3, which is different.

Similarly, 2×4 can be cut into two 2×2, which can be arranged into 4×2, which is the same as 2×4.

Wait, but according to the output, (2,4) is 'Yes', but 4×2 is the same as 2×4.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps when arranging the two smaller rectangles, we can arrange them in different orientations.

For example, from 2×6, cutting into two 2×3, arranging them side by side horizontally gives 4×3, which is different from 2×6.

But in the case of 2×4, cutting into two 2×2, arranging them side by side horizontally gives 4×2, which is the same as 2×4.

So, in this case, it shouldn't be 'Yes', but according to the program and the example output, it's 'Yes'.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to arrange the pieces.

If I cut the 2×4 into two 2×2 pieces, I can arrange them side by side vertically to get 2×4, which is the same, or horizontally to get 4×2, which is the same.

So, no new rectangle is formed.

But the output is 'Yes', which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to cut the rectangle.

Wait, maybe cutting parallel to the other side.

For (2,4):

- Cut parallel to side a (cutting b into two parts):

- Cut b=4 into b1 and b2, say 2 and 2.

- Get two 2×2 rectangles.

- Arrange them to form 4×2 or 2×4, which are the same as the original.

- No new rectangle.

- Cut parallel to side b (cutting a into two parts):

- Cut a=2 into a1 and a2, say 1 and 1.

- Get two 1×4 rectangles.

- Arrange them to form 2×4, which is the same as the original.

- Or arrange them to form 4×2, which is the same.

So, in this case, no new rectangle can be formed.

But according to the program and the example output, it's 'Yes'.

This suggests that the program is incorrect for this input.

Wait, but in the example outputs, (2,4) is 'Yes', but according to my analysis, it should be 'No'.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a way to form a new rectangle.

Let me think again.

If I cut a=2 into a1=1 and a2=1, getting two 1×4 rectangles.

Then, I can arrange them side by side horizontally to get 2×4, which is the same as the original.

Alternatively, arrange them vertically to get 1×8, which is different from 2×4.

Wait, is 1×8 different from 2×4?

Yes, because 1×8 is not the same as 2×4 even after rotation.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a new rectangle.

Hence, 'Yes' is correct.

I must have missed that arrangement earlier.

So, by cutting a=2 into two 1×4 rectangles, and then arranging them to form a 1×8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2×4.

Hence, 'Yes' is correct.

Similarly, for (6,3):

- Cut a=6 into a1=3 and a2=3, getting two 3×3 rectangles.

- Arrange them side by side horizontally to get 6×3, which is the same as the original.

- Arrange them vertically to get 3×6, which is the same as the original.

- No new rectangle.

Hence, 'No' is correct.

For (3,2):

- Cut a=3 into a1=1 and a2=2, getting two rectangles: 1×2 and 2×2.

- Arrange them side by side horizontally: 3×2, same as original.

- Arrange them vertically: 1×4, which is different from 3×2.

Hence, 'Yes' is correct.

Wait, but in the program, it checks if b is even. For (3,2), b=2 is even, so 'Yes', which matches.

But in the earlier case of (2,4), b=4 is even, so 'Yes', which also matches.

But in my initial analysis, I thought that for (2,4), no new rectangle can be formed, but actually, it can be formed by cutting a=2 into 1 and 1, and arranging the 1×4 rectangles to form 1×8.

Hence, 'Yes' is correct.

So, perhaps the condition b % 2 == 0 is sufficient.

Wait, but in (2,1), b=1 is odd, 'No', which is correct.

In (1,1), b=1 is odd, 'No', which is correct.

In (2,6), b=6 is even, 'Yes', which is correct.

In (3,2), b=2 is even, 'Yes', correct.

In (2,2), b=2 is even, 'Yes', correct.

In (2,4), b=4 is even, 'Yes', correct.

In (6,3), b=3 is odd, 'No', correct.

So, for these examples, it seems correct.

But is this condition general?

Let me think of another test case.

Consider a=4, b=3:

- b=3 is odd, so program says 'No'.

- Can we form a new rectangle?

- Cut parallel to a:

- Cut b=3 into b1 and b2, say 1 and 2.

- Get two rectangles: 4×1 and 4×2.

- Arrange them side by side horizontally: 4×3, same as original.

- Arrange them vertically: 8×1 and 8×2, which don't form a single rectangle.

- Wait, to form a new rectangle, perhaps arrange them differently.

- Place the 4×1 on top of the 4×2 to get a 4×3, which is the same.

- Or place them side by side horizontally: 4×3, same.

- No new rectangle.

- Cut parallel to b:

- Cut a=4 into a1 and a2, say 2 and 2.

- Get two 2×3 rectangles.

- Arrange them side by side horizontally: 4×3, same as original.

- Arrange them vertically: 2×6, which is different from 4×3.

- So, 2×6 is different from 4×3, hence 'Yes'.

But according to the program, b=3 is odd, so 'No', but in this case, it's possible to form a new rectangle.

Hence, the program is incorrect for this case.

Wait, but in the program, it checks b % 2 == 0.

In this case, b=3 is odd, so 'No', but actually, it's possible to form a new rectangle by cutting a=4 into two 2×3 and arranging them to form 2×6.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: **False**.

**Counterexample:**

- Input: 4 3

- According to the program: b=3 is odd → 'No'

- But actually, it's possible to form a new rectangle (2×6), so it should be 'Yes'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \textbf{False}} \]
