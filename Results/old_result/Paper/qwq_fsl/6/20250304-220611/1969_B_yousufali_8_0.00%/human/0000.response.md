Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a binary string, and calculate the minimum total cost to sort the string in non-descending order through a series of cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each shift is equal to the length of the substring shifted.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. A cyclic shift of a substring means taking the last character of the chosen substring and moving it to the front, pushing the other characters to the right. For example, shifting "101" would turn it into "110". The goal is to sort the entire string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's) with the minimal total cost.

Looking at the provided program, it seems there are two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each case. `func_1` appears to process a single test case.

Let's dive into `func_1`:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

This function reads input as a list of integers (presumably the binary string), initializes counters `n` and `ans` to zero, and then iterates through the list. For each '1' encountered, it increments `n`. When a '0' is found and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. Finally, it prints `ans`.

Wait a minute, this seems off. The problem is about sorting binary strings through cyclic shifts, but this code is reading input as a list of integers and performing some operations based on the counts of '1's and '0's. It doesn't seem to be directly manipulating the string or performing any shifts. Is this the correct approach?

Let me think about the problem again. To sort a binary string in non-descending order, we need to move all '0's to the front and all '1's to the back. The operations allowed are cyclic shifts on any substring, and each shift costs the length of the substring shifted.

An efficient way to do this would be to identify the positions where the string deviates from the sorted order and calculate the minimal cost to fix those deviations.

For example, in the first test case:

Input: 10

Desired output: 01

One cyclic shift of the entire string (cost 2) can achieve this.

In the second test case:

Input: 0000

It's already sorted, so no operations are needed (cost 0).

In the third test case:

Input: 11000

One possible sequence of operations:

1. Shift substring [1,3]: 110 -> 011 (cost 3)

Resulting string: 01100

2. Shift substring [2,4]: 110 -> 011 (cost 3)

Resulting string: 00110

3. Shift substring [3,5]: 110 -> 011 (cost 3)

Resulting string: 00011 (cost 9)

But is this the minimal cost? Maybe there are sequences with lower total cost.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way to calculate the minimal cost without simulating each shift. Maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be exploited due to the specific nature of the allowed operations and the goal.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift can be seen as moving the last character of the substring to the front. In terms of sorting, this could be used to move '0's to the front and '1's to the back.

Perhaps the minimal cost can be calculated based on the number of '1's before '0's in the string, as each such inversion might require a shift of a certain substring to correct.

But the code provided seems to be counting the number of '1's and adding `n + 1` to the answer each time a '0' is encountered after some '1's. Is this coincidentally correct, or is there a logical error here?

Let me try to apply this logic to the first test case:

Input: 10

s = [1, 0]

Initialize n=0, ans=0

i=0: s[0]=1, n=1

i=1: s[1]=0, n != 0, ans += 1 + 1 = 2

Total ans=2, which matches the first test case.

Second test case:

Input: 0000

s = [0,0,0,0]

n=0

For each '0', since n=0, no addition to ans

ans=0, correct.

Third test case:

Input: 11000

s = [1,1,0,0,0]

i=0: 1, n=1

i=1: 1, n=2

i=2: 0, n=2 !=0, ans += 2 +1 =3, ans=3

i=3: 0, n=2 !=0, ans +=2 +1=3, ans=6

i=4: 0, n=2 !=0, ans +=2 +1=3, ans=9

Which matches the third test case.

Fourth test case:

Input: 101011

s = [1,0,1,0,1,1]

i=0:1, n=1

i=1:0, n=1!=0, ans +=1+1=2, ans=2

i=2:1, n=2

i=3:0, n=2!=0, ans +=2+1=3, ans=5

i=4:1, n=3

i=5:1, n=4

ans=5

Which matches the fourth test case.

Fifth test case:

Input:01101001

s = [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]

i=0:0, n=0

i=1:1, n=1

i=2:1, n=2

i=3:0, n=2!=0, ans +=2+1=3, ans=3

i=4:1, n=3

i=5:0, n=3!=0, ans +=3+1=4, ans=7

i=6:0, n=3!=0, ans +=3+1=4, ans=11

i=7:1, n=4

ans=11

Which matches the fifth test case.

So, in all the provided examples, the code gives the correct output. Does this mean the code is correct?

Well, the code seems to be working for these cases, but I need to ensure it's correct for all possible inputs. I need to think about potential edge cases or scenarios where this logic might fail.

Let me consider a few more test cases:

Test case 6:

Input: 00

Already sorted, should cost 0.

According to the code:

s = [0,0]

i=0:0, n=0

i=1:0, n=0

ans=0, correct.

Test case 7:

Input: 100

To sort: 001

Option 1:

Shift [1,3]: 100 -> 010 (cost 3)

Shift [1,3]: 010 -> 001 (cost 3)

Total cost: 6

But is there a cheaper way?

Alternative:

Shift [2,3]: 100 -> 100 (no change)

Shift [1,2]: 100 -> 010 (cost 2)

Shift [1,3]: 010 -> 001 (cost 3)

Total cost: 5

Is there a way to do it cheaper?

Another way:

Shift [1,2]: 100 -> 010 (cost 2)

Shift [2,3]: 010 -> 001 (cost 2)

Total cost: 4

Wait, according to the code:

s = [1,0,0]

i=0:1, n=1

i=1:0, n=1!=0, ans +=1+1=2, ans=2

i=2:0, n=1!=0, ans +=1+1=2, ans=4

Which matches the alternative sequence I just thought of. So, it seems correct.

Test case 8:

Input: 1110

To sort: 0111

Option 1:

Shift [1,4]: 1110 -> 0111 (cost 4)

Total cost:4

Alternative:

Shift [1,2]: 1110 -> 1110 (no change)

Shift [3,4]: 1110 -> 1101 (cost 2)

Shift [2,4]: 1101 -> 1011 (cost 3)

Shift [1,3]: 1011 -> 0111 (cost 3)

Total cost:2+3+3=8, which is higher than the first option.

According to the code:

s = [1,1,1,0]

i=0:1, n=1

i=1:1, n=2

i=2:1, n=3

i=3:0, n=3!=0, ans +=3+1=4, ans=4

Which matches the minimal cost of 4.

Seems correct.

Test case 9:

Input: 0101

To sort: 0011

Option 1:

Shift [2,3]: 0101 -> 0101 (no change)

Shift [1,2]: 0101 -> 1001 (cost 2)

Shift [3,4]: 1001 -> 1010 (cost 2)

Shift [2,3]: 1010 -> 1010 (no change)

Not leading to the sorted string.

Alternative:

Shift [2,4]: 0101 -> 0110 (cost 3)

Shift [1,3]: 0110 -> 1100 (cost 3)

Total cost:6

Is there a cheaper way?

Another approach:

Shift [1,4]: 0101 -> 1010 (cost 4)

Shift [1,4]: 1010 -> 0101 (cost 4)

Not helpful.

Shift [2,3]: 0101 -> 0101 (no change)

Seems like the minimal cost is 6.

According to the code:

s = [0,1,0,1]

i=0:0, n=0

i=1:1, n=1

i=2:0, n=1!=0, ans +=1+1=2, ans=2

i=3:1, n=2

ans=2

Wait, but the minimal cost should be 6 according to my earlier steps. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, according to the code, ans=2, but according to my steps, minimal cost is 6. This is a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps my steps are incorrect.

Let me think again.

Input: 0101

Desired: 0011

Possible steps:

1. Shift [2,4]: 0101 -> 0110 (cost 3)

2. Shift [2,3]: 0110 -> 0110 (no change)

3. Shift [1,2]: 0110 -> 1010 (cost 2)

4. Shift [3,4]: 1010 -> 1001 (cost 2)

5. Shift [2,3]: 1001 -> 1001 (no change)

Not leading to the desired string.

Alternative approach:

1. Shift [1,4]: 0101 -> 1010 (cost 4)

2. Shift [1,4]: 1010 -> 0101 (cost 4)

Again, not helpful.

Another idea:

1. Shift [2,3]: 0101 -> 0101 (no change)

No progress.

It seems challenging to get to 0011 with shifts, and my earlier steps didn't achieve it. Maybe the minimal cost is higher than I thought.

Given that, perhaps the code is incorrect because for input "0101", it outputs 2, but the minimal cost seems higher based on my attempts.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a more efficient sequence of shifts.

Alternative:

1. Shift [1,3]: 0101 -> 1001 (cost 3)

2. Shift [2,4]: 1001 -> 1010 (cost 3)

Total cost:6

Still higher than the code's output of 2.

Is there a way to achieve the sorted string with a cost of 2?

Let me try:

1. Shift [1,2]: 0101 -> 1001 (cost 2)

2. Shift [3,4]: 1001 -> 1010 (cost 2)

Total cost:4

Still higher than 2.

I can't think of a way to achieve the sorted string with a cost of 2. Maybe the code is incorrect.

Let me check another test case.

Test case 10:

Input: 1001

Desired: 0011

Possible steps:

1. Shift [1,3]: 1001 -> 0011 (cost 3)

Achieved with cost 3.

According to the code:

s = [1,0,0,1]

i=0:1, n=1

i=1:0, n=1!=0, ans +=1+1=2, ans=2

i=2:0, n=1!=0, ans +=1+1=2, ans=4

i=3:1, n=2

ans=4

But minimal cost is 3, which is less than the code's output of 4. So, another discrepancy.

This suggests that the code is not correctly calculating the minimal cost.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

I have found test cases where the code's output does not match the minimal possible cost.

Hence, the Correctness is **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum total cost to make a given binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. Each cyclic shift operation on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) costs that length.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Cyclic Shifts**: A cyclic shift on a substring moves the last character of the substring to the front, shifting other characters to the right.
2. **Problem Analysis**: We need to transform the binary string into a sorted string (all '0's followed by all '1's) with minimal cost.
3. **Insight**: Instead of simulating shifts, calculate the cost based on the positions where '1's appear before '0's, as these inversions need to be corrected.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - Read the binary string as a list of integers.
    - Initialize counters `n` and `ans` to zero.
    - Traverse the string:
        - Increment `n` for each '1' encountered.
        - If a '0' is encountered and `n` is not zero, add `n + 1` to `ans`.
3. **Output the Result**: For each test case, print the accumulated cost `ans`.

This approach incorrectly calculates the minimal cost for certain test cases, as demonstrated in the analysis. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
