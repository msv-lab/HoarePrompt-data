Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The goal is to determine whether the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If it does, I need to print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partial correctness isn't acceptable; the program must handle every potential case correctly to be considered correct.

To approach this, I need to thoroughly understand both the problem description and the provided program. I'll need to think step-by-step, considering various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the program behaves as expected in all situations.

First, let's understand the problem:

**Problem Description:**

Alice and Bob are playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice starts with an empty array `c`. They take turns, with Alice going first. On Alice's turn, she picks one element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`. On Bob's turn, he picks one element from `a`, and deletes it from `a`. The game ends when `a` is empty. The score is defined as the MEX of `c` (the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`). Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it. We need to find the game's final score if both play optimally.

**Input:**

- The first line contains `t` (number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4).

- Each test case starts with `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), followed by a line containing `n` integers a1 to an (0 ≤ ai < n).

- It's guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases doesn't exceed 2·10^5.

**Output:**

For each test case, output the game's score if both players play optimally.

**Example:**

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

Now, let's look at the provided program:

```python

big = 1000000007

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

func_1(arr)

def func_1(arr):

freq = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in arr:

freq[i] += 1

cou = 0

for i in range(n + 1):

if freq[i] >= 2:

continue

if freq[i] == 1:

cou += 1

if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:

print(i)

break

```

Hmm, there are a few things to note here. First, the function `func_1` is defined after it's called, which might cause a runtime error because Python evaluates the code sequentially. Functions need to be defined before they are called. So, this is a potential issue.

But let's assume that's just a typo in the representation, and the function is actually defined before it's called in the actual code. I'll proceed under that assumption.

Next, I need to understand what the program is trying to do.

It seems to be calculating the frequency of each number in the array and then iterating through the range 0 to n inclusive to find the MEX based on some conditions.

But is this the correct approach for the problem?

Let's think about the problem more deeply.

The game involves Alice and Bob making moves alternately, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`, and Bob trying to minimize it. Both play optimally.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example:

- MEX of [0, 1, 2] is 3

- MEX of [1, 2, 3] is 0

- MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2

Given that, the goal is to find the final MEX of array `c` after both players have played optimally.

Now, let's think about how the game progresses.

- Alice picks an element to append to `c` and deletes it from `a`.

- Bob picks an element to delete from `a`.

This continues until `a` is empty.

Given that Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, their strategies will be different.

Alice will try to include numbers in `c` that help achieve a higher MEX, while Bob will try to hinder that by removing elements that could prevent Alice from achieving her goal.

This seems like a game theory problem where both players are playing optimally.

To solve this, I need to model the game and determine the optimal strategy for both players.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this without simulating the entire game.

Let's consider the frequency of each number in the initial array `a`.

Suppose a number `x` appears `freq[x]` times in `a`.

Alice can choose to include `x` in `c`, and Bob can choose to remove `x` from `a`.

Since Alice and Bob are playing optimally, I need to consider how their choices affect the final composition of `c`.

Let's think about the possible scenarios:

1. If a number `x` appears at least twice, Alice can ensure that at least one instance of `x` makes it into `c`, because even if Bob removes one, Alice can pick another one.

2. If a number `x` appears only once, Alice can pick it and add it to `c`, but Bob cannot remove it anymore since it's already in `c`.

3. If a number `x` doesn't appear in `a`, it can't be added to `c`.

Given this, perhaps the MEX can be determined based on which numbers can be ensured to be in `c` by Alice.

Wait, but Bob can also influence which numbers are available for Alice to pick.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we consider that Alice can choose to include any number that appears an odd number of times, and Bob can prevent numbers that appear an even number of times from being included in `c`.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let's think in terms of the number of times each number appears.

- If a number `x` appears an even number of times, Bob can pair the picks such that Alice cannot include `x` in `c`.

- If a number `x` appears an odd number of times, Alice can ensure that at least one instance of `x` is included in `c`.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to consider the parity of the frequency.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s consider that each number `x` has a certain number of copies in `a`, say `freq[x]`.

Since Alice and Bob alternate turns, and Alice picks first, the total number of picks related to `x` depends on the parity of `freq[x]`.

- If `freq[x]` is odd, Alice can ensure that at least one `x` is included in `c`.

- If `freq[x]` is even, Bob can ensure that no `x` is included in `c`.

Wait, is that accurate?

Let’s take an example.

Suppose `x` appears once:

- Alice picks `x` and adds it to `c`.

- Bob cannot do anything about it.

So, `x` is in `c`.

If `x` appears twice:

- Alice picks `x` and adds it to `c`.

- Bob picks the other `x` and removes it from `a`.

- So, `x` is effectively removed from `a`, but Alice has already added one `x` to `c`.

Wait, but in this case, Alice has included one `x` in `c`.

Wait, no, Bob can remove the remaining `x`, but the one Alice added is already in `c`.

So, in this case, `x` is in `c`.

Wait, but according to the previous thought, if `freq[x]` is even, Bob can prevent `x` from being in `c`, but in this example, `x` is still in `c`.

So perhaps the earlier thought is incorrect.

Let me think again.

If `freq[x]` is odd:

- Alice can ensure that at least one `x` is in `c`.

If `freq[x]` is even:

- Bob can ensure that no `x` is in `c`.

Wait, but in the frequency 2 case, Alice adds one `x` to `c`, and Bob removes the other `x` from `a`. So `x` is still in `c`.

So, in this case, even when `freq[x]` is even, Alice can still get one `x` into `c`.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, for each number `x`, if `freq[x]` is odd, Alice can force at least one `x` into `c`. If `freq[x]` is even, Alice can still get one `x` into `c`.

Wait, but in the even frequency case, Bob can pair the elements and remove them, preventing Alice from adding any to `c`.

Wait, no.

Let’s consider `freq[x] = 2`.

- Alice picks `x` and adds it to `c`.

- Bob picks the other `x` and removes it from `a`.

- So, `x` is in `c`.

Alternatively, Bob could have picked `x` first, but since Alice picks first, she can choose to pick `x` and add it to `c`.

Wait, but in this scenario, `x` ends up in `c`.

So, perhaps for even frequencies, Alice can still get at least one `x` into `c`.

Wait, but what if Bob also wants to prevent `x` from being in `c`?

Wait, but once Alice adds `x` to `c`, it's in `c`, even if Bob removes the other `x` from `a`.

So, in this case, `x` is in `c`.

Therefore, for any `freq[x] >= 1`, Alice can ensure that at least one `x` is in `c`.

Wait, is that true?

Wait, no.

If `freq[x]` is even, Bob can interfere with Alice's ability to add `x` to `c`.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the sequence of moves.

Let’s model the game more carefully.

Let’s consider that the game consists of `n` moves, since `a` has `n` elements.

Alice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice starting first.

Alice's move: pick an element from `a`, add it to `c`, and delete it from `a`.

Bob's move: pick an element from `a`, delete it from `a`.

The game ends when `a` is empty.

At the end, the MEX of `c` is calculated.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

So, Alice wants `c` to have as many small numbers as possible, to make the MEX as large as possible.

Bob wants to prevent Alice from achieving that, by removing elements that could help Alice.

Given that, how can we determine the final MEX?

This seems complex, but perhaps there's a smarter way to look at it.

Let’s consider that Alice can choose to include certain numbers in `c`, and Bob can choose to remove certain numbers from `a`, affecting what Alice can include.

Given that, perhaps we can model this as a game where Alice can control whether certain numbers are in `c`, and Bob can try to limit Alice's choices.

An alternative approach is to consider the number of times each number appears and how many turns Alice and Bob get.

Since Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first, and Alice gets to choose which element to add to `c`, while Bob just removes an element.

Wait, but Bob can choose which element to remove, which could affect Alice's choices.

This seems tricky.

Let’s consider the frequency of each number.

Suppose a number `x` appears `freq[x]` times.

Each time Alice picks `x`, she adds it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

Each time Bob picks `x`, he just deletes it from `a`.

So, for a number `x`, the number of times it can be added to `c` is the number of times Alice picks it.

Given that, for each `x`, the maximum number of times Alice can add `x` to `c` is ceil(freq[x]/2).

Because for each pair of `x`, Bob can cancel one of Alice's additions by removing the other one.

But if freq[x] is odd, Alice can add one more `x` to `c`.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(freq[x]/2) + 1 if freq[x] is odd.

Wait, no, it's ceil(freq[x]/2).

For example:

- freq[x] = 1: ceil(1/2) = 1, Alice can add 1 `x` to `c`.

- freq[x] = 2: ceil(2/2) = 1, Alice can add 1 `x` to `c`.

- freq[x] = 3: ceil(3/2) = 2, Alice can add 2 `x` to `c`.

Wait, but in freq[x] = 3, Alice can add 2 `x` to `c`, but actually, Bob can only remove one `x`, so Alice can add two `x` to `c`.

Wait, no.

Let’s simulate:

- freq[x] = 3

- Turn 1: Alice picks `x`, adds to `c`, a now has two `x`.

- Turn 2: Bob picks `x`, removes one `x`, a now has one `x`.

- Turn 3: Alice picks `x`, adds to `c`, a now has zero `x`.

So, `c` has two `x`.

So, ceil(freq[x]/2) seems correct.

Similarly, for freq[x] = 4:

- Turn 1: Alice picks `x`, adds to `c`, a has three `x`.

- Turn 2: Bob picks `x`, removes one `x`, a has two `x`.

- Turn 3: Alice picks `x`, adds to `c`, a has one `x`.

- Turn 4: Bob picks `x`, removes it, a has zero `x`.

So, `c` has two `x`.

Which is ceil(4/2) = 2.

So, in general, Alice can add ceil(freq[x]/2) instances of `x` to `c`.

Given that, the final frequency of `x` in `c` is ceil(freq[x]/2).

Then, the MEX is the smallest `k` such that ceil(freq[k]/2) = 0.

Wait, no.

Wait, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

So, we need to find the smallest `k` such that `k` is not in `c`.

Given that Alice can add ceil(freq[k]/2) instances of `k` to `c`, if ceil(freq[k]/2) >=1, then `k` is in `c`.

Otherwise, `k` is not in `c`.

Therefore, MEX is the smallest `k` where ceil(freq[k]/2) == 0.

Which means freq[k] == 0.

Wait, but ceil(freq[k]/2) == 0 only when freq[k] == 0.

Wait, no, ceil(0/2) = 0.

But if freq[k] >=1, then ceil(freq[k]/2) >= 1/2 >=1.

Wait, ceil(1/2) = 1.

So, for freq[k] >=1, ceil(freq[k]/2) >=1.

Hence, k is in `c`.

Therefore, MEX is the smallest k where freq[k] == 0.

Wait, but that can't be right.

Consider the first test case:

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

freq[0]=2, ceil(2/2)=1, so 0 is in c.

freq[1]=2, ceil(2/2)=1, so 1 is in c.

freq[2]=0, ceil(0/2)=0, so 2 is not in c.

Hence, MEX=2.

Which matches the first output.

Second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

freq[0]=1, ceil(1/2)=1, so 0 in c.

freq[1]=1, ceil(1/2)=1, so 1 in c.

freq[2]=1, ceil(1/2)=1, so 2 in c.

freq[3]=1, ceil(1/2)=1, so 3 in c.

freq[4]=0, ceil(0/2)=0, so 4 not in c.

Hence, MEX=4, but the output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the output for the second test case is 1, but according to my earlier logic, MEX should be 4.

But according to the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps the example output is incorrect, or perhaps my logic is flawed.

Wait, let's check the second test case more carefully.

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible game:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Wait, so MEX=1.

But according to my earlier logic, ceil(freq[0]/2)=1, so 0 in c.

ceil(freq[1]/2)=1, so 1 in c.

But in this game, 1 is not in c.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Alice cannot ensure that ceil(freq[k]/2) instances of k are in c.

In this case, freq[1]=1, ceil(1/2)=1, but in the game, 1 is not in c because Bob removed it.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Hence, the approach needs to be revised.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider the number of times Alice can pick a number before Bob can remove all its occurrences.

This seems more involved.

An alternative approach is to realize that Alice can choose to include any subset of numbers in `c`, but Bob can interfere by removing numbers.

Given that, perhaps I need to find the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve despite Bob's attempts to minimize it.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider the problem in terms of available moves.

Each number `x` has `freq[x]` copies.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting.

Each turn:

- Alice picks one element, adds it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- Bob picks one element and deletes it from `a`.

The game ends when `a` is empty.

The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.

Alice wants to maximize MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

Wait, actually, Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which means making the MEX as large as possible, meaning making sure that as many small numbers as possible are included in `c`.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, meaning he wants to ensure that some small numbers are not in `c`.

So, Alice will try to include the smallest numbers possible, while Bob will try to prevent her from doing so.

Given that, perhaps the MEX is determined by the numbers that Alice can successfully include in `c`.

But I need a better way to model this.

Let’s consider that for each number `x`, Alice needs to include it in `c` if possible.

To include `x` in `c`, Alice needs to pick it and add it to `c` before Bob can remove all instances of it.

Given that, for each `x`, the number of times Alice can pick `x` is ceil(freq[x]/2).

Wait, perhaps this is still applicable.

If ceil(freq[x]/2) >=1, then Alice can include `x` in `c`.

Otherwise, she cannot.

Hence, for MEX purposes, if ceil(freq[x]/2) >=1, then `x` is in `c`.

Else, `x` is not in `c`.

In the second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

freq[0]=1, ceil(1/2)=1 → 0 in c

freq[1]=1, ceil(1/2)=1 → 1 in c

freq[2]=1, ceil(1/2)=1 → 2 in c

freq[3]=1, ceil(1/2)=1 → 3 in c

freq[4]=0, ceil(0/2)=0 → 4 not in c

Hence, MEX=4, but according to the example, it's 1.

So, this contradicts the example.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can remove elements in a way that prevents Alice from including certain elements.

In the second test case, it's possible that Bob can remove elements such that Alice cannot include all the numbers she wants.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Suppose that for each number `x`, if freq[x] is odd, Alice can include `x` in `c`.

If freq[x] is even, Bob can prevent Alice from including `x` in `c`.

Wait, but in the first test case, freq[0]=2 (even), freq[1]=2 (even).

According to this, Bob can prevent Alice from including 0 and 1.

But in the first test case, MEX=2, meaning that 0 and 1 are included in `c`.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include `x` in `c` if freq[x] >=1, because she can pick it first and add it to `c`, and Bob can only remove one, but it's already in `c`.

Wait, but in the second test case, freq[1]=1, so Alice can include 1 in `c`, but in the example, MEX=1, meaning 1 is not in `c`.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

I need to think differently.

Let’s consider the total number of elements Alice can include in `c`.

Since Alice picks first, and they alternate turns, Alice can pick ceil(n/2) elements, and Bob can pick floor(n/2) elements.

But Bob can choose to remove any element, not necessarily the ones Alice wants.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal set of numbers that Alice can include in `c`.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me look at the provided program again.

The program counts the frequency of each number and then iterates from 0 to n+1 to find the first number with freq[i] < 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2, so it should print 2, which matches the first output.

In the second test case, freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1, so cou starts at 0.

For i=0: freq[0]=1, cou=1

For i=1: freq[1]=1, cou=2, since cou==2, print 1

Which matches the second output.

In the third test case, n=2, a=[1,1], freq[0]=0, freq[1]=2.

Iterate:

i=0: freq[0]=0, print 0

Which matches the third output.

So, in all the example cases, the program seems to be working correctly.

But is this logic correct in general?

According to the program, it seems that if freq[i] >=2, skip.

If freq[i]==1, increment cou.

If cou==2 or freq[i]==0, print i.

Is this the correct way to determine the MEX?

Wait, perhaps the logic is that Alice can include at least one of each number that appears at least once, and if a number appears at least twice, she can include one, and the other can be removed by Bob.

Wait, but in the second test case, all numbers appear once, so Alice can include one of each in `c`.

But according to the example, MEX=1, which suggests that 1 is not in `c`.

But according to this logic, Alice can include all of them.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Let me think about the second test case again.

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Possible game:

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1

Alternatively, another possible game:

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[1,2], MEX=0

Wait, but according to the example, MEX=1.

So, in different games, different MEX can be achieved.

But the problem asks for the score when both play optimally.

So, Alice wants to maximize MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

Given that, I need to find the MEX when both play optimally.

In this case, it seems that MEX=1 is achievable, but MEX=0 is also possible.

So, what should be the correct output?

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of who has the last move.

Given that Alice starts first, and they alternate, with Alice making the first move.

Total number of moves is n, which is the length of the array.

Alice makes ceil(n/2) moves, Bob makes floor(n/2) moves.

In the second test case, n=4, Alice makes 2 moves, Bob makes 2 moves.

Alice can include 2 elements in `c`.

So, she can choose any 2 distinct elements to include in `c`.

Bob can remove 2 elements.

But since Bob can't influence what Alice adds to `c`, as once Alice adds it, it's in `c` regardless of Bob's actions.

So, in the second test case, Alice can choose to include, say, 0 and 1 in `c`, making `c`=[0,1], MEX=2.

But according to the example, MEX=1.

So, perhaps my understanding is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps Bob can remove elements that Alice wants to include.

Wait, but once Alice adds an element to `c`, it stays, regardless of Bob's actions.

So, in the second test case, Alice can include any two distinct numbers in `c`, making MEX=2.

But the example output is 1, which suggests that MEX=1.

So, perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the MEX is determined by the numbers present in `c`, regardless of their frequency.

So, if `c` contains [0,2], MEX=1.

If `c` contains [0,1], MEX=2.

If `c` contains [1,2], MEX=0.

Wait, in the example, it's 1.

So, perhaps the minimal MEX that Bob can force is 1.

Wait, perhaps Bob can prevent Alice from including 1 in `c`.

Wait, how?

In the second test case, a=[0,1,2,3]

- Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3]

- Bob picks 1, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[0,2], MEX=1

Alternatively,

- Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3]

- Bob picks 0, a=[2,3]

- Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3]

- Bob picks 3, a=[]

Final c=[1,2], MEX=0

So, depending on the choices, MEX can be 1 or 0.

Bob, who wants to minimize MEX, can force MEX=1 by removing 1 when Alice hasn't included it.

Wait, in the first sequence, Bob removes 1, preventing it from being in `c`, resulting in MEX=1.

In the second sequence, Bob removes 0 and 3, allowing MEX=0.

So, Bob can choose to remove 1 to force MEX=1.

Hence, the minimal MEX that Bob can force is 1, which is the output.

So, in this case, Bob can choose to remove 1, ensuring that MEX is 1.

Hence, the output is 1.

So, perhaps the logic is to find the smallest `k` such that Bob can ensure that `k` is not in `c`.

Given that, perhaps the program is trying to find the smallest `k` where freq[k] < 2.

Because if freq[k] >=2, Alice can ensure that `k` is in `c`, as she can pick it at least once, even if Bob removes one.

If freq[k] ==1, Bob can remove it before Alice picks it, thus ensuring it's not in `c`.

Wait, but in the first test case, freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2, so Alice can ensure 0 and 1 are in `c`, hence MEX=2.

In the second test case, freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1, so Bob can choose to remove one of them, ensuring that one number is missing in `c`.

Hence, the smallest `k` that Bob can ensure is not in `c` is 1.

Wait, but freq[0]=1, so Bob can choose to remove 0, making MEX=0.

But in the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose to include the smallest numbers possible.

In the second test case, Alice can choose to include 0 and 1, making MEX=2.

Bob can try to prevent this by removing one of them.

But if Bob removes 0, Alice can include 1 and 2, making MEX=0.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each number `k`, Alice can include it in `c` if freq[k] >=1, because she can pick it and add it to `c` before Bob can remove it.

But in the second test case, freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1.

So, Alice can include any two of them in `c`.

Bob can remove two others.

But depending on Bob's choices, he can force a certain MEX.

In the example, MEX=1 is the minimal MEX Bob can force.

Hence, perhaps the program is trying to find the smallest `k` where freq[k] <2, meaning Bob can ensure it's not in `c`.

In the second test case, freq[0]=1 <2, so MEX=0.

But in the example, it's 1.

So, perhaps this logic is incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's the smallest `k` where freq[k] <=1.

In the third test case, n=2, a=[1,1], freq[0]=0, freq[1]=2.

So, freq[0]=0 <2, hence MEX=0.

In the first test case, freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2, so no k with freq[k]<2, hence MEX=2.

In the second test case, freq[0]=1 <2, so MEX=0, but the example output is 1.

So, there's inconsistency.

Hence, the program's logic seems flawed.

Wait, perhaps the program is trying to find the smallest `k` where freq[k] <=1.

In the first test case, freq[0]=2, freq[1]=2, so no k with freq[k]<=1, hence MEX=2.

In the second test case, freq[0]=1, freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1, so smallest k with freq[k]<=1 is 0, but output is 1.

Wait, contradiction.

Wait, perhaps it's the smallest k where freq[k] <2 and k is not forced into c by Alice.

But this is getting too convoluted.

I think the program's logic is incorrect.

Hence, the Correctness is **False**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
