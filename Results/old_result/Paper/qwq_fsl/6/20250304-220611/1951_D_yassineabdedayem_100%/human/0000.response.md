Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to help Bob set up stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins. The program needs to output "YES" if it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with integer prices between 1 and 10^18 to make Alice buy exactly k jewels, and "NO" otherwise. If "YES", it should also provide the number of stalls and their prices.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins. So, for each stall, she buys floor(remaining_coins / price) jewels.

The program needs to determine if there's a way to set up at most 60 stalls with appropriate prices so that the total jewels bought by Alice is exactly k.

Looking at the provided program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif n + 2 > k * 2:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
            print(1)
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This program seems to handle the cases where n equals k or when n + 2 > k * 2 by setting up 1 or 2 stalls respectively. Otherwise, it outputs "NO". But I need to verify if this logic is sufficient for all possible cases.

Let me think about the problem more generally. For any n and k, I need to find a sequence of stall prices p1, p2, ..., ps (where s <= 60) such that the total jewels Alice buys is exactly k.

One straightforward way is to set up stalls with decreasing prices, starting from the highest possible price down to 1, to minimize the number of stalls. However, the given program seems to handle only up to 2 stalls for certain conditions and outputs "NO" otherwise.

Let me consider some examples to test the program.

**Example 1:**

Input:

3

7 3

6 4

255 8

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

NO

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

In this example, for the first test case (7,3), the program sets up 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, and Alice buys 3 jewels in total. For the second test case (6,4), it outputs "NO", and for the third test case (255,8), it sets up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and Alice buys 8 jewels.

Now, looking back at the provided program, it seems that it doesn't match the output of the example. In the example, for (7,3), it outputs "YES" with 10 stalls, but according to the program, for n + 2 > k * 2 (7 + 2 > 3 * 2 => 9 > 6), it should output "YES" with 2 stalls: prices n - k + 1 and 1, which would be 7 - 3 + 1 = 5 and 1. So, stalls with prices 5 and 1.

Let's simulate that:

- Stall 1: price = 5. Alice has 7 coins. She buys floor(7/5) = 1 jewel, spends 5 coins, remaining 2 coins.

- Stall 2: price = 1. Alice has 2 coins. She buys floor(2/1) = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins, remaining 0 coins.

Total jewels bought: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3.

So, in this case, the program's output is correct.

For the second test case (6,4):

n + 2 > k * 2 => 6 + 2 > 4 * 2 => 8 > 8, which is false, so it outputs "NO".

But in the example, it's supposed to output "NO", which matches.

For the third test case (255,8):

The program would check n + 2 > k * 2 => 255 + 2 > 8 * 2 => 257 > 16, which is true, so it would output "YES" with 2 stalls: prices 255 - 8 + 1 = 248 and 1.

Let's simulate that:

- Stall 1: price = 248. Alice has 255 coins. She buys floor(255/248) = 1 jewel, spends 248 coins, remaining 7 coins.

- Stall 2: price = 1. Alice has 7 coins. She buys floor(7/1) = 7 jewels, spends 7 coins, remaining 0 coins.

Total jewels bought: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k=8.

So, in this case, the program's output is correct.

Wait, but in the example, it sets up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, which also correctly results in Alice buying 8 jewels. So, multiple solutions are possible.

Now, I need to verify if the program's logic is sufficient for all possible cases.

Looking at the program:

- If n == k, set up 1 stall with price 1. Alice will buy n jewels, which equals k.

- If n + 2 > k * 2, set up 2 stalls: one with price n - k + 1 and one with price 1.

- Else, output "NO".

I need to check if these conditions cover all possible cases where it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

First, let's consider the condition n == k.

- If n == k, setting up one stall with price 1 allows Alice to buy n jewels, which is correct.

Next, the condition n + 2 > k * 2.

- This seems arbitrary. I need to understand why this condition is used.

Let me rearrange the inequality: n + 2 > 2k â‡’ n - 2k + 2 > 0.

This seems like a specific condition, but I'm not sure about its general applicability.

Let me think about the general case.

Suppose I have n coins and want Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

I need to find a sequence of stall prices p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n / p1) + floor((n - floor(n / p1) * p1) / p2) + ... = k.

This is a bit complex to handle directly.

An alternative approach is to consider the minimal number of stalls required to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

One way is to use the greedy approach: set the first stall's price as high as possible so that Alice buys as few jewels as possible at that stall, then repeat for the remaining coins and stalls.

But the program seems to use a different approach.

Let me consider some edge cases.

**Case 1: n = 1, k = 1**

- According to the program, n == k, so output "YES", 1 stall with price 1.

- Correct.

**Case 2: n = 1, k = 2**

- n != k, and n + 2 = 3 > 2 * 2 = 4? 3 > 4 is false, so output "NO".

- Correct, since with n=1, Alice can buy at most one jewel.

**Case 3: n = 3, k = 2**

- n + 2 = 5 > 2 * 2 = 4, so output "YES" with 2 stalls: prices 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 and 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 2, buys 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, remaining 1 coin.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 2, which is correct.

**Case 4: n = 4, k = 3**

- n + 2 = 6 > 3 * 2 = 6? 6 > 6 is false, so output "NO".

- But let's see if it's possible with more than 2 stalls.

- For example, 3 stalls with prices 2, 2, 1.

- Stall 1: price 2, buys 2 jewels, spends 4 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: price 2, but no coins left, so 0 jewels.

- Stall 3: price 1, no coins left, so 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than k=3.

- Another attempt: stalls with prices 2, 1, 1.

- Stall 1: price 2, buys 2 jewels, spends 4 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, no coins left.

- Stall 3: price 1, no coins left.

- Total jewels: 2, still less than k=3.

- Another attempt: stalls with prices 1, 1, 1.

- Stall 1: price 1, buys 4 jewels, spends 4 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, no coins left.

- Stall 3: price 1, no coins left.

- Total jewels: 4, which is more than k=3.

- So, it seems impossible to get exactly k=3 jewels with n=4 coins.

- Hence, "NO" is correct.

**Case 5: n = 5, k = 4**

- n + 2 = 7 > 4 * 2 = 8? 7 > 8 is false, so output "NO".

- Let's see if it's possible.

- stalls with prices 2, 2, 1.

- Stall 1: price 2, buys 2 jewels, spends 4 coins, remaining 1 coin.

- Stall 2: price 2, buys 0 jewels.

- Stall 3: price 1, buys 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 3, which is less than k=4.

- stalls with prices 2, 1, 1.

- Stall 1: price 2, buys 2 jewels, spends 4 coins, remaining 1 coin.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 3: price 1, no coins left.

- Total jewels: 3, still less than k=4.

- stalls with prices 1, 1, 1.

- Stall 1: price 1, buys 5 jewels, spends 5 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, no coins left.

- Stall 3: price 1, no coins left.

- Total jewels: 5, more than k=4.

- So, seems impossible to get exactly k=4 jewels with n=5 coins.

- Hence, "NO" is correct.

**Case 6: n = 10, k=5**

- n + 2 = 12 > 5 * 2 = 10? 12 > 10 is true, so output "YES" with 2 stalls: prices 10 - 5 + 1 = 6 and 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 6, buys 1 jewel, spends 6 coins, remaining 4 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 4 jewels, spends 4 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 5, which is correct.

**Case 7: n = 1, k = 1**

- Already covered, but another way: stalls with prices 1.

- Output "YES" with 1 stall: price 1.

- Correct.

**Case 8: n = 2, k = 1**

- n + 2 = 4 > 1 * 2 = 2? 4 > 2 is true.

- Set up 2 stalls: prices 2 - 1 + 1 = 2 and 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 2, buys 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, no coins left.

- Total jewels: 1, which is correct.

**Case 9: n = 2, k = 2**

- n == k, so output "YES" with 1 stall: price 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 1, buys 2 jewels, spends 2 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 2, which is correct.

**Case 10: n = 3, k = 1**

- n + 2 = 5 > 1 * 2 = 2? 5 > 2 is true.

- Set up 2 stalls: prices 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 and 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 3, buys 1 jewel, spends 3 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, no coins left.

- Total jewels: 1, which is correct.

**Case 11: n = 3, k = 3**

- n == k, so output "YES" with 1 stall: price 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 1, buys 3 jewels, spends 3 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 3, which is correct.

**Case 12: n = 4, k = 1**

- n + 2 = 6 > 1 * 2 = 2? 6 > 2 is true.

- Set up 2 stalls: prices 4 - 1 + 1 = 4 and 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 4, buys 1 jewel, spends 4 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, no coins left.

- Total jewels: 1, which is correct.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 2, which is correct.

**Case 14: n = 6, k = 3**

- n + 2 = 8 > 3 * 2 = 6? 8 > 6 is true.

- Set up 2 stalls: prices 6 - 3 + 1 = 4 and 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 4, buys 1 jewel, spends 4 coins, remaining 2 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 2 jewels, spends 2 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 3, which is correct.

- Set up 2 stalls: prices 8 - 4 + 1 = 5 and 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 5, buys 1 jewel, spends 5 coins, remaining 3 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 3 jewels, spends 3 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 4, which is correct.

**Case 17: n = 9, k = 5**

**Case 18: n = 10, k = 5**

- Already covered in Case 6.

**Case 19: n = 11, k = 6**

- n + 2 = 13 > 6 * 2 = 12? 13 > 12 is true.

- Set up 2 stalls: prices 11 - 6 + 1 = 6 and 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 6, buys 1 jewel, spends 6 coins, remaining 5 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 5 jewels, spends 5 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 6, which is correct.

**Case 20: n = 12, k = 6**

- n + 2 = 14 > 6 * 2 = 12? 14 > 12 is true.

- Set up 2 stalls: prices 12 - 6 + 1 = 7 and 1.

- Stall 1: price 7, buys 1 jewel, spends 7 coins, remaining 5 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 5 jewels, spends 5 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 6, which is correct.

From these cases, it seems that the program's logic works for various values of n and k where n + 2 > k * 2.

Now, let's consider cases where n + 2 <= k * 2, and see if the program correctly outputs "NO".

**Case 21: n = 6, k = 4**

- n + 2 = 8 > 4 * 2 = 8? 8 > 8 is false.

- Program outputs "NO".

- Let's see if it's possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly k=4 jewels.

- Try with 2 stalls: prices p1 and p2.

- Option 1: p1 = 3, p2 = 2.

- Stall 1: floor(6/3) = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: no coins left.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than k=4.

- Option 2: p1 = 2, p2 = 1.

- Stall 1: floor(6/2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: no coins left.

- Total jewels: 3, which is less than k=4.

- Option 3: p1 = 1, p2 = 1.

- Stall 1: floor(6/1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: no coins left.

- Total jewels: 6, which is more than k=4.

- So, seems impossible to get exactly k=4 jewels with n=6 coins.

- Hence, "NO" is correct.

**Case 22: n = 5, k = 3**

- n + 2 = 7 > 3 * 2 = 6? 7 > 6 is true.

- Program outputs "YES" with 2 stalls: prices 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 and 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 3, buys 1 jewel, spends 3 coins, remaining 2 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 2 jewels, spends 2 coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 3, which is correct.

**Case 23: n = 4, k = 3**

- Already covered in Case 4.

**Case 24: n = 3, k = 2**

- Already covered in Case 3.

**Case 25: n = 2, k = 2**

- Already covered in Case 9.

**Case 26: n = 1, k = 1**

- Already covered in Case 1 and Case 7.

Now, let's consider some other cases where n + 2 > k * 2, but see if the program's approach of setting up only 2 stalls is always sufficient.

**Case 27: n = 10^{18}, k = 1**

- n == k, so output "YES" with 1 stall: price 1.

- Alice buys 10^{18} jewels, which is not equal to k=1.

- Wait, this is incorrect.

- So, when n == k, setting up one stall with price 1 allows Alice to buy n jewels, which is equal to k only if n = k.

- But in this case, n = 10^{18} and k=1, so n != k, but according to the program, it would output "YES" with 1 stall: price 1.

- But this is incorrect because Alice would buy 10^{18} jewels, not 1.

- So, the program is flawed here.

- Wait, but in the program, it checks if n == k, then outputs "YES" with 1 stall: price 1.

- But in this case, n = 10^{18} and k=1, n != k, so this condition doesn't apply.

- Wait, no, if n == k, even if n = 10^{18} and k = 10^{18}, it should output "YES" with 1 stall: price 1.

- But in the case where n = 10^{18} and k =1, n != k, so it goes to the next condition.

- n + 2 > k * 2 => 10^{18} + 2 > 2, which is true.

- So, it outputs "YES" with 2 stalls: prices n - k +1 = 10^{18} -1 +1 = 10^{18} and 1.

- Simulation:

- Stall 1: price 10^{18}, buys 1 jewel, spends 10^{18} coins, remaining 0 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, no coins left.

-
