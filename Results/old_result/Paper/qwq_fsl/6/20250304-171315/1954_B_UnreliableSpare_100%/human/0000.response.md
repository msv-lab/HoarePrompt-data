Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each involving an array that's described as "beautiful." The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array is no longer beautiful, or output -1 if it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what makes an array "beautiful" according to the description. An array is beautiful if, through a series of specific operations, you can make all its elements the same. The operation allowed is: choose an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a[i - 1] equals a[i + 1], and replace a[i] with a[i - 1]. This can be done any number of times, even zero.

So, the task is to make the array non-beautiful by removing the least number of elements possible. If it's impossible to make it non-beautiful, output -1.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the array and tries to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.

Let me walk through the program step by step.

1. The main function reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, calls `func_1()`.

2. In `func_1()`:

- It reads the integer n, which is the length of the array.

- It reads the array arr of n integers.

- It sets a flag to True and checks if all elements in the array are the same by comparing each element to the previous one. If any element differs, it sets flag to False.

- If the flag is still True after the loop, meaning all elements are the same, it prints -1, as per the problem statement: "An array consisting of identical numbers will remain beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it."

- If the flag is False, meaning there are differing elements in the array, it proceeds to calculate the minimum number of elements to remove.

3. It initializes `ans` to positive infinity (`Decimal('Infinity')`), which is a good way to ensure any valid count will be smaller.

4. It sets `val` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0.

5. It iterates through the array:

- If the current element equals `val`, it increments `cnt`.

- If it doesn't, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, resets `cnt` to 0, and sets `val` to the new element.

- After the loop, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and the last `cnt`.

6. Finally, it prints `ans` if it's less than n, otherwise, it prints -1.

Wait, actually, in the provided code, it just prints `ans` after calculating it, assuming `ans` is finite. But according to the logic, if `ans` is less than n, it should print `ans`; otherwise, print -1. But in the code, it seems to always print `ans`, which could be less than n or equal to some finite value.

Hmm, perhaps I need to check if `ans` is equal to some specific value to decide -1.

Wait, in the code, after calculating `ans`, it checks if `flag` is True and prints -1, else prints `ans`. But in the explanation, it should print -1 if it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.

So, I need to understand when it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.

From the problem statement, if the array is already non-beautiful, or if removing some elements makes it non-beautiful, but in the code, it seems to assume that if all elements are the same, it's impossible, which aligns with the example.

But I need to ensure that the logic for calculating `ans` is correct when the array is not entirely identical.

Looking back at the second example in the problem description:

Input:

5

1 2 1 2 1

Output:

1

Explanation:

Remove the element at index 5, resulting in [1,2,1,2], which is not beautiful.

In the code, for this array:

- n = 5

- arr = [1,2,1,2,1]

- flag = False, because elements differ.

- val = 1, cnt = 0

- i=0: arr[0]==1, cnt=1

- i=1: arr[1]!=1, ans=min(ans,0)=0, cnt=0, val=2

- i=2: arr[2]==1!=val=2, ans=min(0,0)=0, cnt=0, val=1

- i=3: arr[3]==2!=val=1, ans=min(0,0)=0, cnt=0, val=2

- i=4: arr[4]==1!=val=2, ans=min(0,0)=0, cnt=0

- Finally, ans=0

- Since flag=False, it prints 0, but the expected output is 1.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here. According to the example, it should print 1, but according to the code, it would print 0. That suggests the code is incorrect.

But perhaps I misread the code.

Wait, the code prints `ans` when `flag` is False, and in this case, `ans` is 0.

But in the example, the expected output is 1.

So, this is a problem. The code is not matching the expected output for this test case.

Let me check the third test case:

Input:

1

1

Output:

-1

In the code:

- n=1

- arr=[1]

- flag=True, because only one element.

- So, it prints -1, which matches the expected output.

Fourth test case:

Input:

7

3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output:

3

In the code:

- n=7

- arr=[3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

- flag=False, because 5 is different.

- val=3, cnt=0

- i=0: arr[0]==3, cnt=1

- i=1: arr[1]==3, cnt=2

- i=2: arr[2]==3, cnt=3

- i=3: arr[3]==5!=val=3, ans=min(inf,3)=3, cnt=0, val=5

- i=4: arr[4]==3!=val=5, ans=min(3,0)=0, cnt=0, val=3

- i=5: arr[5]==3, cnt=1

- i=6: arr[6]==3, cnt=2

- Finally, ans=min(0,2)=0

- flag=False, so prints 0, but expected output is 3.

Wait, again, the code's output doesn't match the expected output.

So, it seems there's a fundamental flaw in the logic used in the program.

Let me try to understand what the program is trying to do.

It seems the program is trying to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same, across all groups of the same values in the array. It does this by iterating through the array, grouping consecutive identical elements, and keeping track of the smallest group size.

Then, it seems to assume that removing that smallest group will break the beautiful property.

But, from the problem statement and examples, this doesn't seem to be the correct approach.

Looking back at the second example:

Original array: [1,2,1,2,1]

Expected output: 1

According to the program's logic, it would find groups:

- [1], [2], [1], [2], [1]

- The smallest group size is 1

- So, it should print 1, which matches the expected output.

Wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought it would print 0, but actually, in the code, it initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`, and then updates it with the minimum group size.

In this case, the group sizes are all 1, so `ans` would be 1, which matches the expected output.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Let me re-examine.

In the second test case:

arr = [1,2,1,2,1]

Group sizes:

- 1: size 1

- 2: size 1

- 1: size 1

- 2: size 1

- 1: size 1

So, the smallest group size is 1, which matches the expected output.

But in the fourth test case:

arr = [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

Group sizes:

- 3: size 3

- 5: size 1

- 3: size 3

So, the smallest group size is 1, but the expected output is 3.

This suggests that simply taking the smallest group size isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand the problem better.

The problem is to make the array not beautiful by removing the fewest elements possible.

An array is beautiful if you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing a[i] with a[i-1] where a[i-1] == a[i+1], for 2 <= i <= n-1.

So, to make it not beautiful, we need to ensure that after removal, it's impossible to make all elements the same using these operations.

Looking at the fourth test case:

Original array: [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

If we remove 3 elements, for example, the first three 3's, we get [5,3,3,3].

Is this array not beautiful?

Let's see:

- Initial array: [5,3,3,3]

- Can we perform any operations?

- Check i=2: a[1]=5, a[3]=3; since 5 != 3, cannot replace a[2].

- Check i=3: a[2]=3, a[4]=3; since a[2]=a[4], can replace a[3] with a[2], resulting in [5,3,3,3] -> [5,3,3,3] (no change).

- Or, replace a[3] with a[2], which is 3, so still [5,3,3,3].

- No further operations can be performed, and the elements are not all the same.

Hence, it's not beautiful.

But according to the program, it would choose to remove the group of size 1 (the 5), which is only 1 removal.

Let's see what happens if we remove only one element, specifically the 5:

New array: [3,3,3,3,3]

Is this not beautiful?

No, because all elements are already the same, so it's still beautiful.

Wait, but according to the problem, if all elements are the same, it's still beautiful.

So, removing only one element (the 5) results in [3,3,3,3,3], which is still beautiful.

Hence, removing one element isn't enough to make it not beautiful.

We need to remove at least three elements to break the beauty.

So, the program's approach of removing the smallest group isn't sufficient.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Another way to look at it is that removing the smallest group might not be enough to break the beauty if other larger groups can still be made equal through operations.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimum number of removals such that no single value dominates in a way that allows all elements to be made equal through the operations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about breaking the sequence so that no operation can be performed, meaning no a[i-1] == a[i+1] for any i.

But that seems too simplistic.

Looking back at the problem, it's about making it impossible to make all elements equal through the specified operations.

So, perhaps, if there are multiple groups of the same value, removing elements from the smallest group might not be sufficient if other groups can still be made equal.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that no value appears in all connected components after removal.

But I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have an array where all elements are the same; we can never make it not beautiful by removals because removing any elements still leaves all elements equal.

But according to the problem, in such cases, we should output -1.

Wait, but in the first test case, [2,2,2], n=3, output is -1, which matches.

In the second test case, [1,2,1,2,1], n=5, output is 1.

In the third test case, [1], n=1, output is -1.

In the fourth test case, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], n=7, output is 3.

From the fourth test case, removing one element isn't enough to break the beauty, as shown earlier.

So, the program's approach of removing the smallest group isn't sufficient.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

I need to find a correct approach.

Perhaps, the correct approach is to find the minimum number of removals such that no value can be spread across the array through the operations.

Wait, perhaps it's about finding the minimum number of removals to break the array into parts where no operation can make all elements equal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about finding the minimal number of removals such that the remaining array cannot be made uniform through the specified operations.

Considering that the operations allow changing a[i] to a[i-1] if a[i-1] == a[i+1], it seems like the array can be made uniform if there's a value that appears in every segment where such operations can be performed.

This seems quite involved.

An alternative approach might be to find the minimal number of removals to ensure that no value can be propagated to cover the entire array through the allowed operations.

But this is still unclear.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should consider that the program's approach is flawed, as evidenced by the fourth test case, and thus the correctness is False.

But to be thorough, I should try to think of another test case where the program fails.

Consider this test case:

Input:

6

1 2 1 2 1 2

According to the problem, this should require removing at least two elements to break the beauty.

But according to the program, it would find groups of size 1 for each 1 and 2 alternately, so ans=1, which is incorrect.

Hence, another failure.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{False}} \]
