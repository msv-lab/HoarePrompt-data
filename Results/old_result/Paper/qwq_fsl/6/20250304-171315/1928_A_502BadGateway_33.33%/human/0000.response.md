Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". The key here is to ensure that the program handles all possible cases correctly, and if it fails even in one scenario, it's considered incorrect.

Let's first understand the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Description

Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \). He tries to cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then, Bob tries to form some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90° rotation, they are considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6×4 and 4×6 are considered the same.

The task is to help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just wasting his time.

### Input

- Each test consists of multiple test cases.
- The first line contains a single integer \( t \) (\( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)) — the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers \( a \) and \( b \) (\( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9 \)) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

### Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the \( a \times b \) rectangle; otherwise, output "No".

### Example

Input:

```

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

```

Output:

```

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

```

### Program to Verify

```python

for _ in range(int(input())):

    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())

    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):

    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'

```

### Approach to Verification

1. **Understand the Logic**:
    - The program defines a function `func_1(a, b)` that returns 'yes' if \( b \) is even, otherwise 'no'.
    - It processes each test case by reading \( a \) and \( b \), and then prints the result from `func_1(a, b)`.

2. **Analyze the Problem**:
    - Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
    - From these two smaller rectangles, he tries to form a new rectangle.
    - The new rectangle should be different from the original one, considering that rotations don't create a different rectangle.

3. **Determine Correctness**:
    - We need to check if the program correctly identifies whether Bob can form a new rectangle different from the original one.
    - The program's logic is based solely on whether \( b \) is even. This seems simplistic and might not cover all scenarios.

### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
    - **Case 1**: \( 1 \times 1 \)
        - Cannot be cut into two rectangles.
        - Output: 'No' (as per example)
    - **Case 2**: \( 2 \times 1 \)
        - Cutting parallel to the longer side: \( 1 \times 1 \) and \( 1 \times 1 \)
        - Forming a new rectangle: Only \( 1 \times 2 \) or \( 2 \times 1 \), which is the same as original.
        - Output: 'No' (as per example)
    - **Case 3**: \( 2 \times 6 \)
        - Cutting parallel to the longer side: \( 2 \times 3 \) and \( 2 \times 3 \)
        - Forming a new rectangle: \( 4 \times 3 \), which is different from \( 2 \times 6 \)
        - Output: 'Yes' (as per example)
    - **Case 4**: \( 3 \times 2 \)
        - Cutting parallel to the longer side: \( 1 \times 2 \) and \( 2 \times 2 \)
        - Forming a new rectangle: \( 1 \times 4 \), which is different from \( 3 \times 2 \)
        - Output: 'Yes' (as per example)
    - **Case 5**: \( 2 \times 2 \)
        - Cutting parallel to any side: \( 1 \times 2 \) and \( 1 \times 2 \)
        - Forming a new rectangle: \( 1 \times 4 \), which is different from \( 2 \times 2 \)
        - Output: 'Yes' (as per example)
    - **Case 6**: \( 2 \times 4 \)
        - Cutting parallel to the longer side: \( 2 \times 2 \) and \( 2 \times 2 \)
        - Forming a new rectangle: \( 4 \times 2 \), which is the same as original.
        - But according to example, output is 'Yes', which suggests there might be another way to cut and form a different rectangle.
    - **Case 7**: \( 6 \times 3 \)
        - Cutting parallel to the longer side: \( 3 \times 3 \) and \( 3 \times 3 \)
        - Forming a new rectangle: \( 6 \times 3 \), which is the same as original.
        - Output: 'No' (as per example)

2. **Program's Logic**:
    - The program checks if \( b \) is even.
    - If \( b \) is even, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, 'no'.

3. **Potential Issues**:
    - The program only considers \( b \) being even, ignoring \( a \).
    - In the example, for \( 2 \times 4 \), \( b = 4 \) is even, so it returns 'yes', which matches the example.
    - For \( 6 \times 3 \), \( b = 3 \) is odd, so it returns 'no', matching the example.
    - However, this might not cover all scenarios. For instance, what if \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd?

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - **Case 1**: \( 1 \times 1 \)
        - Program: \( b = 1 \) (odd) → 'no' (correct)
    - **Case 2**: \( 2 \times 1 \)
        - Program: \( b = 1 \) (odd) → 'no' (correct)
    - **Case 3**: \( 2 \times 6 \)
        - Program: \( b = 6 \) (even) → 'yes' (correct)
    - **Case 4**: \( 3 \times 2 \)
        - Program: \( b = 2 \) (even) → 'yes' (correct)
    - **Case 5**: \( 2 \times 2 \)
        - Program: \( b = 2 \) (even) → 'yes' (correct)
    - **Case 6**: \( 2 \times 4 \)
        - Program: \( b = 4 \) (even) → 'yes' (correct)
    - **Case 7**: \( 6 \times 3 \)
        - Program: \( b = 3 \) (odd) → 'no' (correct)

5. **General Case Analysis**:
    - Suppose \( a = 4 \), \( b = 3 \)
        - Cutting parallel to \( a \): \( 2 \times 3 \) and \( 2 \times 3 \)
            - Forming a new rectangle: \( 4 \times 3 \) (same as original)
        - Cutting parallel to \( b \): \( 4 \times 1 \) and \( 4 \times 2 \)
            - Forming a new rectangle: \( 4 \times 3 \) (same as original)
        - Program: \( b = 3 \) (odd) → 'no'
        - Seems correct because no new rectangle can be formed.
    - Suppose \( a = 4 \), \( b = 4 \)
        - Cutting parallel to \( a \): \( 2 \times 4 \) and \( 2 \times 4 \)
            - Forming a new rectangle: \( 4 \times 4 \) (same as original)
        - Cutting parallel to \( b \): \( 4 \times 2 \) and \( 4 \times 2 \)
            - Forming a new rectangle: \( 8 \times 2 \), which is different from original.
        - Program: \( b = 4 \) (even) → 'yes'
        - Correct because a new rectangle can be formed.
    - Suppose \( a = 3 \), \( b = 3 \)
        - Cutting parallel to \( a \): \( 1 \times 3 \) and \( 2 \times 3 \)
            - Forming a new rectangle: \( 3 \times 3 \) (same as original)
        - Cutting parallel to \( b \): \( 3 \times 1 \) and \( 3 \times 2 \)
            - Forming a new rectangle: \( 3 \times 3 \) (same as original)
        - Program: \( b = 3 \) (odd) → 'no'
        - Correct because no new rectangle can be formed.

6. **Potential Flaw**:
    - Consider \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \)
        - Cutting parallel to \( a \): \( 1 \times 3 \) and \( 1 \times 3 \)
            - Forming a new rectangle: \( 1 \times 6 \), which is different from original.
        - Cutting parallel to \( b \): \( 2 \times 1 \) and \( 2 \times 2 \)
            - Forming a new rectangle: \( 2 \times 3 \) (same as original)
        - Possible to form a new rectangle.
        - Program: \( b = 3 \) (odd) → 'no'
        - This seems incorrect because a new rectangle can be formed.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not account for scenarios where \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd. In such cases, it's possible to form a new rectangle by cutting parallel to the side with even length, but the program would return 'no' since \( b \) is odd.

**Correctness: False**

**Explanation**:

- The program only checks if \( b \) is even to decide whether a new rectangle can be formed.
- However, there are cases where \( b \) is odd, but by cutting parallel to \( a \) (if \( a \) is even), a new rectangle can be formed.
- For example, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \):
    - Cutting parallel to \( a \): \( 1 \times 3 \) and \( 1 \times 3 \)
    - Forming a new rectangle: \( 1 \times 6 \), which is different from the original \( 2 \times 3 \)
    - Program returns 'no' because \( b = 3 \) is odd, which is incorrect.
