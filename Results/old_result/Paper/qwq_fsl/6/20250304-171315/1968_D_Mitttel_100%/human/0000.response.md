Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements as specified in the description. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partially correct programs are considered incorrect. I have to be thorough and consider all potential cases to ensure the program works as expected.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the provided program.

## Final Solution
To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to ensure it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement for all possible test cases. The program is designed to simulate a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, make moves based on a permutation and an array of values, and the winner is determined based on their scores after a specified number of turns.

### Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` and an array `a`.
   - Two players, Bodya and Sasha, start from positions `P_B` and `P_S` respectively.
   - The game consists of `k` turns.
   - In each turn, each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation `p`.
   - The player's score increases by the value `a[x]` of their current position in each turn.
   - The player with the higher score after `k` turns wins. If scores are equal, it's a draw.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - Since both players make decisions simultaneously and optimally, we need to maximize each player's score independently.
   - The problem reduces to finding the maximum possible score each player can achieve given their starting positions and the permutation.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Each player can choose to stay or move to the permuted position in each turn.
   - To maximize the score, a player should choose the action (stay or move) that leads to the highest cumulative score over `k` turns.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We need to simulate the game for both players using the function `func_1`, which calculates the maximum score achievable from a given starting position over `k` turns.
   - The function should explore both choices (stay or move) and select the one that maximizes the score.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - We need to ensure that `func_1` correctly computes the maximum score for a player given their starting position and the number of turns.
   - The main function should correctly compare the scores of both players and determine the winner or a draw.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    stay = a[s] + func_1(a, p, s, k - 1)
    move = a[p[s]] + func_1(a, p, p[s], k - 1)
    return max(stay, move)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    # Adjusting indices to be 0-based
    p = [x - 1 for x in p]
    a = [x for x in a]  # No need to adjust a[i], as per problem
    pb -= 1
    ps -= 1
    A = func_1(a, p, pb, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')
```

### Explanation

1. **func_1 Function**:
   - This recursive function calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` with `k` turns left.
   - In each turn, the player has two choices:
     - Stay at the current position and add `a[s]` to the score.
     - Move to position `p[s]` and add `a[p[s]]` to the score.
   - The function recursively computes the score for both choices and selects the maximum.

2. **Main Function**:
   - Reads the input for the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - Adjusts indices to be 0-based for easier manipulation.
   - Computes the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`.
   - Compares the scores and prints the result accordingly.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally, and their scores are maximized based on their choices at each turn. The recursive function explores all possible sequences of choices, making sure that the program is correct for all potential cases.
