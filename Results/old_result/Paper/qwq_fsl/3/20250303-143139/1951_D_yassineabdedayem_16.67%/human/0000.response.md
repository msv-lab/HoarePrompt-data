Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to help Bob set up stalls with specific pricing so that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins. The program needs to output "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices if it's possible, or "NO" if it's not.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's stalls. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall.

The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels, using at most 60 stalls.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to attempt to solve this problem. I need to verify if this program correctly achieves this goal for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

Let me analyze the program step by step.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases, t. Then, for each test case, it reads n and k, which are the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

The program then enters a loop where it tries to set up stalls with specific prices. It uses variables rep, number, and tab. Rep seems to count the number of stalls set up, number seems to represent the price of the current stall, and tab is a list to store the prices of the stalls.

Inside the loop, it calculates Min and Max based on n // k and n / k, but there's a confusion here because n // k is the floor division, which is the integer part of n divided by k, and n / k is floating point division.

Then, it has an if condition that checks if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k. If true, it sets number to Min and reduces k by Max. Otherwise, it sets number to Max and reduces k by Min. It also reduces n by Min * Max and increments rep by 1.

Finally, if k equals 0, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the stall prices. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This logic seems a bit convoluted, and I'm not entirely sure it's correct. Let me think about a better approach to solve this problem.

One straightforward way to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels is to set up stalls with prices that allow her to buy a specific number of jewels at each stall, summing up to exactly k jewels.

Given that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, one possible strategy is to set up stalls with decreasing prices, starting from the highest possible price down to the lowest, ensuring that Alice buys the required number of jewels.

For example, in the first test case:

n = 7, k = 3

One possible setup is to have a single stall with price 2. Alice can buy 3 jewels (since 3*2=6, leaving her with 1 coin), which matches k=3.

Another example:

n = 255, k = 8

The solution provided in the problem note is to have 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. Alice buys 1 jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

But in the second test case:

n = 6, k = 4

The program outputs "NO", meaning it's impossible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels.

I need to verify if the given program can handle these cases correctly.

Let me consider some test cases to validate the program.

Test case 1:

Input:

1

7 3

Expected Output:

YES

1

2

Explanation:

With n=7 coins and k=3 jewels, setting up one stall with price 2 allows Alice to buy 3 jewels (since 3*2=6, leaving 1 coin).

Does the program output this correctly? According to Example Answer 1, it does.

Test case 2:

Input:

1

6 4

Expected Output:

NO

Explanation:

It's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Let's see why.

If we set up one stall with price 1, Alice buys 6 jewels (more than 4).

With price 2, she buys 3 jewels.

With price 3, she buys 2 jewels.

No combination seems to allow exactly 4 jewels.

Hence, "NO" is the correct output.

Test case 3:

Input:

1

255 8

Expected Output:

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Explanation:

As per the problem note, this setup makes Alice buy exactly 8 jewels.

Now, let's consider some edge cases.

Edge case 1:

Input:

1

1 1

Expected Output:

YES

1

1

Explanation:

With n=1 coin and k=1 jewel, setting up one stall with price 1 allows Alice to buy exactly 1 jewel.

Edge case 2:

Input:

1

1 2

Expected Output:

NO

Explanation:

With n=1 coin, it's impossible to buy 2 jewels, even if we set up stalls with price 1. Alice would buy 1 jewel from the first stall and wouldn't have any coins left for the next stall.

Edge case 3:

Input:

1

1000000000000000000 1

Expected Output:

YES

1

1000000000000000000

Explanation:

With n=10^18 coins and k=1 jewel, setting up one stall with price 10^18 allows Alice to buy exactly 1 jewel.

Edge case 4:

Input:

1

1 100

Expected Output:

NO

Explanation:

With only 1 coin, it's impossible to buy 100 jewels, no matter how the stalls are set up.

Another test case:

Input:

1

10 5

Expected Output:

YES

2

2 2

Explanation:

With n=10 coins, setting up two stalls with price 2 each. Alice buys 5 jewels from the first stall (5*2=10), and doesn't go to the second stall because she has no coins left.

Wait, but according to the problem, Alice buys as many jewels as possible at each stall, then moves to the next stall. So in this case, she buys 5 jewels from the first stall and stops because she has no coins left.

Hence, "YES" with 2 stalls, both with price 2.

But the program might not output this correctly, depending on its logic.

Let me look into the program's logic more carefully.

In the program, there is this calculation:

(Min, Max) = (min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k))

This seems confusing. n // k is the floor division, which is the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy if all stalls have price 1. But int(n / k) is the same as n // k for integer division.

Then, it checks if Max == k and n * Min <= k. This condition seems off. If Max == k, and n * Min <= k, then set number = Min and reduce k by Max. Else, set number = Max and reduce k by Min.

This doesn't seem to align with the expected behavior.

Perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.

An alternative approach is to use the greedy algorithm in reverse. Start by setting up stalls with the highest possible prices that allow Alice to buy as few jewels as possible, while still reaching the total of k jewels.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the minimum number of stalls required to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so we have some flexibility.

Another idea is to use binary representation. For example, in the third test case, with k=8, they set up 8 stalls with prices that are powers of 2, from 128 down to 1. This way, Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling k jewels.

But this might not be the most efficient way, and it uses more stalls than necessary in some cases.

Wait, in the first example, they use 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, and Alice buys 3 jewels in total.

But in reality, one stall with price 2 would suffice, as shown in the problem's first example.

So, the program's approach seems flawed.

Let me try to think of a correct approach.

One correct approach is to set up stalls with decreasing prices, starting from the highest possible price that Alice can afford, and ensure that the total number of jewels bought is exactly k.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. If k > n, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than the number of coins she has.

2. If k == 0, it's trivially possible by setting up no stalls, but the problem states that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, and setting up zero stalls might be allowed, but according to the problem, Bob can set up at least one stall.

3. Start with the highest possible price, which is n // k. This is the maximum price per jewel that Alice can pay on average.

4. For each stall, set the price as high as possible, and let Alice buy as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins.

5. Repeat this process until Alice has bought exactly k jewels or it's impossible.

But this seems similar to the program's approach, but perhaps not exactly.

Let me consider the first test case again:

n = 7, k = 3

Set up one stall with price 2.

Alice buys 3 jewels (since 3*2=6 <=7), leaving her with 1 coin.

Total jewels bought: 3, which matches k.

Hence, "YES" with 1 stall.

Second test case:

n = 6, k = 4

Attempt to set up stalls:

- Stall 1: price p1.

If p1 = 1, Alice buys 6 jewels, which is more than k=4. So, not acceptable.

- p1 = 2, Alice buys 3 jewels, leaving n=6 - 3*2=0.

Then, she can't buy any more jewels from additional stalls.

Total jewels: 3, which is less than k=4.

- p1 = 3, Alice buys 2 jewels, leaving n=6 - 2*3=0.

Again, total jewels: 2, which is less than k=4.

- p1 = 4, Alice buys 1 jewel, leaving n=6 - 1*4=2.

Then, set up p2 = 2, Alice buys 1 jewel, total jewels: 2, which is still less than k=4.

- p1 = 5, Alice buys 1 jewel, leaving n=6 - 1*5=1.

p2 =1, Alice buys 1 jewel, total jewels: 2.

- p1 =6, Alice buys 1 jewel, leaving n=6 -1*6=0.

No more jewels can be bought.

In all scenarios, Alice can't buy exactly 4 jewels, so "NO" is the correct output.

Third test case:

n=255, k=8

Set up 8 stalls with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.

Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

Hence, "YES" with 8 stalls.

Now, considering the program's logic, it seems to try to find a combination of stalls that sum up to k jewels, but the logic inside the loop is not clear, and it might not handle all cases correctly.

I need to find a case where the program gives an incorrect output.

Let's consider n=10, k=5.

According to my earlier reasoning, setting up two stalls with price 2 each would make Alice buy 5 jewels from the first stall and stop, which should be acceptable.

But according to the program's logic, it might do something different.

Let me simulate the program's behavior for this input.

Initialize:

n=10, k=5, rep=0, number=0, tab=[]

Loop:

rep <60 and n !=0 and k >0 and n >=k

Calculate Min and Max:

Min = min(10//5,5) = min(2,5)=2

Max = max(int(10/5),5) = max(2,5)=5

Check if Max ==k (5==5) and n*Min <=k (10*2=20 <=5)? No, because 20 >5.

So, else clause: number = Max=5, k = k - Min=5-2=3

tab.append('5')

n -= Min*Max=10-2*5=0

rep +=1

Now, n=0, k=3, rep=1

Since n=0 and k=3 >0, it will not enter the loop again.

Since k !=0, it will print "NO"

But according to my earlier thought, setting up two stalls with price 2 each should allow Alice to buy 5 jewels and stop, which should be acceptable.

Hence, the program outputs "NO" for this case, which seems incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe my understanding is wrong.

Wait, if n=10, k=5

Set up one stall with price 2, Alice buys 5 jewels (since 5*2=10), total jewels=5, which matches k=5.

Hence, "YES" with 1 stall, price 2.

But according to the program, it outputs "NO".

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

I have found a case where the program does not work correctly.

Input:

1

10 5

Expected Output:

YES

1

2

But the program outputs "NO"

Hence, the program is incorrect.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins by setting up at most 60 stalls with appropriate pricing per jewel. The provided program attempts to solve this problem but contains logical errors that lead to incorrect outputs in certain cases.

### Approach

1. **Initial Check**: If `k` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to buy more jewels than the number of coins available, so output "NO".
2. **Single Stall Solution**: Check if a single stall can satisfy the condition by setting the price such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
3. **Multiple Stalls Solution**: If a single stall does not suffice, set up multiple stalls with decreasing prices to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels in total across all stalls.

### Solution Code

```python
def can_make_purchase(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return "NO"
    # Try to set up a single stall
    price = n // k
    if price * k == n:
        jewels = n // price
        if jewels == k:
            return "YES\n1\n" + str(price)
    # Try to set up multiple stalls
    stalls = []
    remaining_k = k
    remaining_n = n
    while remaining_k > 0 and len(stalls) < 60:
        # Choose the maximum possible price that allows buying at least one jewel
        price = remaining_n // remaining_k
        if price == 0:
            break
        # Calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy at this price
        jewels = remaining_n // price
        # If jewels exceed remaining_k, adjust the price to buy exactly remaining_k jewels
        if jewels > remaining_k:
            price = (remaining_n + remaining_k - 1) // remaining_k
            jewels = remaining_n // price
        # Update remaining coins and jewels
        remaining_n -= jewels * price
        remaining_k -= jewels
        # Append the price to the stalls list
        stalls.append(str(price))
    if remaining_k == 0:
        return "YES\n" + str(len(stalls)) + "\n" + " ".join(stalls)
    else:
        return "NO"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        print(can_make_purchase(n, k))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Check**: If `k > n`, output "NO" because it's impossible to buy more jewels than the number of coins.
2. **Single Stall Solution**: Check if a single stall with price `price = n // k` allows Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. If `price * k == n` and `n // price == k`, then output "YES" with one stall.
3. **Multiple Stalls Solution**: Use a loop to set up multiple stalls:
   - Choose the maximum possible price that allows Alice to buy at least one jewel.
   - Calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy at this price.
   - If the number of jewels exceeds the remaining required jewels (`remaining_k`), adjust the price to buy exactly `remaining_k` jewels.
   - Update the remaining coins and required jewels.
   - Repeat until all jewels are bought or the maximum number of stalls (60) is reached.
4. **Output**: If exactly `k` jewels are bought, output "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices; otherwise, output "NO".

This approach ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by carefully setting up stall prices and handling edge cases appropriately.
