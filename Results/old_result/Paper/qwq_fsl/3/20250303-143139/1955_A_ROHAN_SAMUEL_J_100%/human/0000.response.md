Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets all the requirements correctly for every possible input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program doesn't fail in any scenario.

Let's start by understanding the problem description. Maxim wants to buy exactly n yogurts. The store sells yogurts at a regular price of a burles each and offers a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles. My task is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, choosing between buying at regular price or at the promotion price for pairs.

The program provided is:

```

def func():

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

        if n % 2:

            if 2 * a < b:

                print(a * n)

            else:

                print(n // 2 * b + a)

        elif 2 * a < b:

            print(a * n)

        else:

            print(n // 2 * b)

```

I need to verify if this program correctly calculates the minimum cost for any given n, a, and b within the specified constraints.

First, I should understand the logic behind the program. The program seems to handle two main cases based on whether n is even or odd.

1. **When n is odd:**

- It checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b).

- If 2 * a < b, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price, so it calculates the total cost as a * n.

- Otherwise, it buys as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price. So, it calculates the cost as (n // 2) * b + a.

2. **When n is even:**

- Again, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b).

- If 2 * a < b, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price, so it calculates the total cost as a * n.

- Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, calculating the cost as (n // 2) * b.

This seems logical at first glance, but I need to verify if this covers all possible scenarios and edge cases.

Let me consider some examples to test the program.

**Example 1:**

Input:

2 5 9

According to the example, output should be 9.

Let's see:

n = 2, a = 5, b = 9

Since n is even, it checks if 2 * a < b => 10 < 9, which is False.

So, it prints (n // 2) * b => 1 * 9 = 9.

Correct.

**Example 2:**

Input:

3 5 9

Output should be 14.

n = 3, a = 5, b = 9

n is odd.

Checks if 2 * a < b => 10 < 9, False.

So, prints (n // 2) * b + a => 1 * 9 + 5 = 14.

Correct.

**Example 3:**

Input:

3 5 11

Output should be 15.

n = 3, a = 5, b = 11

n is odd.

Checks if 2 * a < b => 10 < 11, True.

So, prints a * n => 15.

But according to the note, it's more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than buying two for 11 and one for 5 (which would be 11 + 5 = 16).

So, in this case, buying all three at regular price is cheaper than buying two at promotion and one at regular.

Hence, the program seems correct here.

**Example 4:**

Input:

4 5 11

Output should be 20.

n = 4, a = 5, b = 11

n is even.

Checks if 2 * a < b => 10 < 11, True.

So, prints a * n => 20.

But let's see if there's a better way.

Buying two pairs at promotion price: 2 * 11 = 22, which is more than 20.

Buying all four at regular price: 4 * 5 = 20.

So, indeed, 20 is the minimum.

Now, let's think about other possible cases.

**Case 1: n = 1**

Suppose n = 1, a = 5, b = 9

n is odd.

2 * a < b => 10 < 9, False.

So, (n // 2) * b + a => 0 * 9 + 5 = 5.

Which is correct, since buying one yogurt should cost a = 5.

**Case 2: n = 0**

Wait, n starts from 1 according to the constraints, so n=0 is not possible.

**Case 3: n is even, but promotion is not better.**

n = 4, a = 5, b = 9

2 * a = 10 < b = 9? 10 < 9 is False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 2 * 9 = 18.

But buying all four at regular price: 4 * 5 = 20.

So, 18 is better than 20.

Hence, the program should print 18.

But according to the fourth example, it prints 20.

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

In the fourth example, with n=4, a=5, b=11, it prints 20, which is correct because 2*11=22 is worse than 4*5=20.

But in this case, with n=4, a=5, b=9, the program would print (n // 2) * b = 2 * 9 = 18, which is better than 4 * 5 = 20.

So, the program seems correct.

**Wait, but according to the program:**

For even n:

if 2 * a < b:

print(a * n)

else:

print(n // 2 * b)

So, in this case, 2 * a = 10 < b = 9 is False, so print (n // 2) * b = 18.

Which is correct, as it's cheaper than 20.

But in the fourth example, with b=11, 2 * a = 10 < 11 is True, so print a * n = 20.

Which is correct, because buying two pairs at b=11 each would cost 22, which is more than 20.

So, the program handles this correctly.

**Another case: n=3, a=5, b=10**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 10, which is False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 1 * 10 + 5 = 15.

But let's see:

Option 1: Buy one pair at b=10 and one at a=5: total 15.

Option 2: Buy all three at a=5 each: total 15.

So, both options cost the same, 15.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Another case: n=3, a=5, b=8**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 8, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 1 * 8 + 5 = 13.

Alternative option: buy one pair at b=8 and one at a=5: total 13.

Buy all three at a=5 each: 15.

So, 13 is better.

Hence, correct.

**Another case: n=5, a=5, b=9**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 9, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 2 * 9 + 5 = 23.

Alternative option: buy two pairs at b=9 each and one at a=5: total 18 + 5 = 23.

Buy all five at a=5: 25.

So, 23 is better.

Correct.

**Wait, another option: buy one pair at b=9 and three individually at a=5: 9 + 15 = 24, which is worse than 23.**

So, the program is correct.

**Case where program might fail:**

Suppose n=4, a=3, b=6.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 6, which is False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 2 * 6 = 12.

Alternative option: buy all four individually at a=3 each: 12.

So, both options cost the same, 12.

Hence, correct.

Another case: n=4, a=3, b=5.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 5, which is False.

Wait, 6 < 5 is False, so print (n // 2) * b => 2 * 5 = 10.

But buying all four individually: 4 * 3 = 12.

So, 10 is better.

Hence, correct.

Wait, but according to the program, if 2 * a < b is False, then print (n // 2) * b.

But in this case, 2 * a = 6 < b=5 is False (since 6 is not less than 5), so print 10.

Which is correct, as buying two pairs at 5 each is better than buying individually at 12.

Wait, but 2 * a = 6 < b=5? Wait, 6 < 5 is False, which is correct.

Hence, program is correct.

**Wait, another case: n=5, a=3, b=5.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 5, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 2 * 5 + 3 = 13.

Alternative option: buy two pairs at b=5 each and one at a=3: total 10 + 3 = 13.

Buy all five at a=3: 15.

So, 13 is better.

Another option: buy one pair at b=5 and three individually at a=3 each: 5 + 9 = 14, which is worse than 13.

Hence, correct.

**Wait, what if n=5, a=3, b=7.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 7, True.

So, print a * n => 15.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=7 each and one at a=3: 14 + 3 = 17, which is worse than 15.

- Buy one pair at b=7 and three individually at a=3: 7 + 9 = 16, worse than 15.

- Buy all five at a=3: 15.

So, buying all individually is better, which matches the program's output of 15.

Hence, correct.

**Wait, what if n=6, a=3, b=7.**

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 7, True.

So, print a * n => 18.

Alternative options:

- Buy three pairs at b=7 each: 21.

- Buy two pairs at b=7 and two individually at a=3: 14 + 6 = 20.

- Buy one pair at b=7 and four individually at a=3: 7 + 12 = 19.

- Buy all six individually at a=3: 18.

So, buying all individually is better, which matches the program's output of 18.

Correct.

**Another case: n=6, a=4, b=7.**

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 8 < 7, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 3 * 7 = 21.

Alternative options:

- Buy three pairs at b=7 each: 21.

- Buy two pairs at b=7 and two individually at a=4: 14 + 8 = 22.

- Buy one pair at b=7 and four individually at a=4: 7 + 16 = 23.

- Buy all six individually at a=4: 24.

So, buying three pairs at 21 is better.

Hence, correct.

**Wait, what if n=5, a=4, b=7.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 8 < 7, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 2 * 7 + 4 = 18.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=7 each and one at a=4: 14 + 4 = 18.

- Buy one pair at b=7 and three individually at a=4: 7 + 12 = 19.

- Buy all five individually at a=4: 20.

So, 18 is the best option.

Hence, correct.

**Another case: n=7, a=4, b=7.**

n is odd.

So, 7 is better.

Correct.

n is even.

So, 8 is better.

Correct.

**Wait, what if n=3, a=4, b=7.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 8 < 7, False.

- Buy all three individually at a=4: 12.

So, 11 is better.

Correct.

**Another case: n=3, a=4, b=8.**

n is odd.

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 8 < 8, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 2 * 8 + 4 = 20.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=8 each and one at a=4: 16 + 4 = 20.

- Buy one pair at b=8 and three individually at a=4: 8 + 12 = 20.

- Buy all five individually at a=4: 20.

So, all options cost the same, 20.

Correct.

**Wait, what if n=1, a=4, b=8.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 8 < 8, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 0 * 8 + 4 = 4.

Which is correct, as buying one yogurt should cost a=4.

**Another case: n=0, but n starts from 1, so not necessary.**

**Wait, what if n=6, a=5, b=9.**

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 9, False.

Correct.

**Wait, but is there a scenario where the program might not work?**

Let me think about cases where n is small or where a and b have specific relationships.

**Case: n=1, a=5, b=9.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 9, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 0 * 9 + 5 = 5.

Which is correct.

**Case: n=1, a=1, b=2.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 2 < 2, False.

So, print 0 * 2 + 1 = 1.

Correct.

**Case: n=2, a=1, b=1.**

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 2 < 1, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 1 * 1 = 1.

Alternative option: buy two at a=1 each: 2.

So, 1 is better.

Correct.

**Wait, but in this case, buying two at promotion price b=1 is better than buying individually at a=1 each.

But according to the program, it prints 1, which is correct.

Hence, correct.

**Another case: n=3, a=1, b=1.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 2 < 1, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 1 * 1 + 1 = 2.

Alternative options:

- Buy one pair at b=1 and one at a=1: total 2.

- Buy all three at a=1 each: 3.

So, 2 is better.

Correct.

**Wait, what if n=4, a=1, b=1.**

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 2 < 1, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 2 * 1 = 2.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=1 each: 2.

- Buy one pair at b=1 and two at a=1 each: 1 + 2 = 3.

- Buy all four at a=1 each: 4.

So, 2 is the best option.

Correct.

**Another case: n=5, a=1, b=1.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 2 < 1, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 2 * 1 + 1 = 3.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=1 each and one at a=1: 2 + 1 = 3.

- Buy one pair at b=1 and three at a=1 each: 1 + 3 = 4.

- Buy all five at a=1 each: 5.

So, 3 is the best option.

Correct.

**Wait, what if n=6, a=1, b=1.**

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 2 < 1, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 3 * 1 = 3.

Alternative options:

- Buy three pairs at b=1 each: 3.

- Buy two pairs at b=1 and two at a=1 each: 2 + 2 = 4.

- Buy one pair at b=1 and four at a=1 each: 1 + 4 = 5.

- Buy all six at a=1 each: 6.

So, 3 is the best option.

Correct.

**Another case: n=0, but n starts from 1, so not necessary.

**Wait, what if n=100, a=30, b=50.**

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 60 < 50, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 50 * 50 = 2500.

Alternative option: buy all 100 at a=30 each: 3000.

So, 2500 is better.

Correct.

**Another case: n=99, a=30, b=50.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 60 < 50, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 49 * 50 + 30 = 2450 + 30 = 2480.

Alternative options:

- Buy 49 pairs at b=50 each and one at a=30: 2450 + 30 = 2480.

- Buy 48 pairs at b=50 and three at a=30: 48*50 + 90 = 2400 + 90 = 2490.

- Buy 47 pairs at b=50 and five at a=30: 47*50 + 150 = 2350 + 150 = 2500.

- Buy all 99 at a=30 each: 2970.

So, 2480 is the best option.

Correct.

**Wait, but in this case, buying 49 pairs at 50 and one at 30 gives 2480, which is better than buying all individually at 2970.

Hence, correct.

**Another case: n=1, a=1, b=2.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 2 < 2, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 0 * 2 + 1 = 1.

Which is correct.

**Another case: n=1, a=2, b=1.**

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 4 < 1, False.

Wait, but this seems incorrect.

Wait, 4 < 1 is False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 0 * 1 + 2 = 2.

But in reality, since b=1 and 2 * a = 4 > b=1, but the program is checking if 2 * a < b, which is False, so it's printing a=2.

But actually, perhaps there's a mistake here.

Wait, but in this case, buying one yogurt can only be done at a=2, as the promotion is for two yogurts.

So, even though b=1 is cheaper for two yogurts, Maxim can't buy half a pair.

So, for n=1, he has to buy at a=2.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Wait, but perhaps if b < 2 * a, it's better to buy two yogurts at b and discard one, but in this case, b=1 and a=2.

But n=1, so he can't buy two and discard one, as he only needs one.

So, he has to buy one at a=2.

But actually, in this scenario, it's not possible to utilize the promotion for just one yogurt.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Another case: n=3, a=2, b=3.

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 4 < 3, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 1 * 3 + 2 = 5.

Alternative options:

- Buy one pair at b=3 and one at a=2: total 5.

- Buy all three at a=2 each: 6.

So, 5 is better.

Correct.

**Wait, but what if b < 2 * a, for example, b=3 and a=2.

In this case, 2 * a = 4 > b=3, so it's better to buy pairs at b=3.

But since n is odd, he has to buy one pair at b=3 and one at a=2, totaling 5.

Which is still better than buying all three at a=2 (6).

Hence, correct.

**Another perspective: what if b is less than a, for example, b=3 and a=4.

n=3.

Check if 2 * a < b => 8 < 3, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 1 * 3 + 4 = 7.

Alternative options:

- Buy one pair at b=3 and one at a=4: 7.

- Buy all three at a=4: 12.

So, 7 is better.

Correct.

**Wait, but in this case, b=3 for two yogurts is better than a=4 for one.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Another case: n=4, a=3, b=5.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 5, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 2 * 5 = 10.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=5 each: 10.

- Buy one pair at b=5 and two at a=3 each: 5 + 6 = 11.

- Buy all four at a=3 each: 12.

So, 10 is the best option.

Correct.

**Wait, but what if b > 2 * a.

For example, n=4, a=3, b=7.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 7, True.

So, print a * n => 12.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=7 each: 14.

- Buy one pair at b=7 and two at a=3 each: 7 + 6 = 13.

- Buy all four at a=3 each: 12.

So, buying all individually is better.

Correct.

**Another case: n=5, a=3, b=7.

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 7, True.

So, print a * n => 15.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=7 each and one at a=3: 14 + 3 = 17.

- Buy one pair at b=7 and three at a=3 each: 7 + 9 = 16.

- Buy all five at a=3 each: 15.

So, buying all individually is better.

Correct.

**Wait, but in this case, buying two pairs at b=7 and one at a=3 costs 17, which is more than buying all five at a=3 (15).

Hence, the program is correct.

**Another case: n=6, a=3, b=7.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 7, True.

So, print a * n => 18.

Alternative options:

- Buy three pairs at b=7 each: 21.

- Buy two pairs at b=7 and two at a=3 each: 14 + 6 = 20.

- Buy one pair at b=7 and four at a=3 each: 7 + 12 = 19.

- Buy all six at a=3 each: 18.

So, buying all individually is better.

Correct.

**Wait, but what if n=6, a=3, b=6.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 6, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 3 * 6 = 18.

Alternative options:

- Buy three pairs at b=6 each: 18.

- Buy two pairs at b=6 and two at a=3 each: 12 + 6 = 18.

- Buy one pair at b=6 and four at a=3 each: 6 + 12 = 18.

- Buy all six at a=3 each: 18.

All options cost the same, 18.

Hence, correct.

**Another case: n=5, a=3, b=6.

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 6, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 2 * 6 + 3 = 15.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=6 each and one at a=3: 12 + 3 = 15.

- Buy one pair at b=6 and three at a=3 each: 6 + 9 = 15.

- Buy all five at a=3 each: 15.

All options cost the same, 15.

Correct.

**Wait, what if n=4, a=3, b=6.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 6, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 2 * 6 = 12.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=6 each: 12.

- Buy one pair at b=6 and two at a=3 each: 6 + 6 = 12.

- Buy all four at a=3 each: 12.

All options cost the same, 12.

Hence, correct.

**Another case: n=3, a=3, b=6.

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 6, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 1 * 6 + 3 = 9.

Alternative options:

- Buy one pair at b=6 and one at a=3: 9.

- Buy all three at a=3 each: 9.

All options cost the same, 9.

Correct.

**Wait, what if n=2, a=3, b=6.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 6, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 1 * 6 = 6.

Alternative option: buy two at a=3 each: 6.

Both options cost the same, 6.

Hence, correct.

**Another case: n=2, a=3, b=5.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 5, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 1 * 5 = 5.

Alternative option: buy two at a=3 each: 6.

So, 5 is better.

Correct.

**Wait, but what if n=2, a=3, b=7.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 7, True.

So, print a * n => 6.

Alternative option: buy two at b=7: 7.

So, 6 is better.

Correct.

**Another case: n=3, a=3, b=5.

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 6 < 5, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 1 * 5 + 3 = 8.

Alternative options:

- Buy one pair at b=5 and one at a=3: 8.

- Buy all three at a=3 each: 9.

So, 8 is better.

Correct.

**Wait, but is there any case where the program might fail?

Let me think about cases where n is small or when a and b are equal.

**Case: n=1, a=5, b=5.

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 5, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 0 * 5 + 5 = 5.

Which is correct.

**Case: n=2, a=5, b=5.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 5, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 1 * 5 = 5.

Alternative option: buy two at a=5 each: 10.

So, 5 is better.

Correct.

**Case: n=3, a=5, b=5.

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 5, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 1 * 5 + 5 = 10.

Alternative options:

- Buy one pair at b=5 and one at a=5: 10.

- Buy all three at a=5 each: 15.

So, 10 is better.

Correct.

**Another case: n=4, a=5, b=5.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 5, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 2 * 5 = 10.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=5 each: 10.

- Buy one pair at b=5 and two at a=5 each: 5 + 10 = 15.

- Buy all four at a=5 each: 20.

So, 10 is the best option.

Correct.

**Wait, what if n=5, a=5, b=5.

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 5, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 2 * 5 + 5 = 15.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs at b=5 each and one at a=5: 10 + 5 = 15.

- Buy one pair at b=5 and three at a=5 each: 5 + 15 = 20.

- Buy all five at a=5 each: 25.

So, 15 is the best option.

Correct.

**Another case: n=6, a=5, b=5.

n is even.

Check if 2 * a < b => 10 < 5, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b => 3 * 5 = 15.

Alternative options:

- Buy three pairs at b=5 each: 15.

- Buy two pairs at b=5 and two at a=5: 10 + 10 = 20.

- Buy one pair at b=5 and four at a=5: 5 + 20 = 25.

- Buy all six at a=5 each: 30.

So, 15 is the best option.

**Wait, but in all these cases, the program seems to be working correctly.

Is there any edge case where it might fail?

Let me consider the minimal values.

**Case: n=1, a=1, b=1.

n is odd.

Check if 2 * a < b => 2 < 1, False.

So, print (n // 2) * b + a => 0 * 1 + 1 = 1.

Which is correct.

**Case: n=1, a=
