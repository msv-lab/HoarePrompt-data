Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". The key here is to ensure that the program works for every potential case, and if it fails even for a single case, it should be considered incorrect.

First, I need to understand the problem description thoroughly. The problem is about determining whether it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube from the top of the tower. The tower starts with no cubes.

The program provided is a Python code that takes input for multiple test cases and for each test case, it reads two integers n and m and decides whether it's possible to end up with m cubes after n moves.

Looking at the program:

- It reads the number of test cases, kreker.

- For each test case, it calls func_1().

- In func_1(), it reads n and m.

- It checks if (n - m) is even and non-negative.

- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'.

Now, I need to verify if this logic correctly solves the problem.

Let's think about the problem.

Each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube. So, in n moves, we can have a combination of add and remove operations.

Let's denote:

- a = number of add operations

- r = number of remove operations

We have:

a + r = n  (total moves)

And the net cubes added are a - r, because each add operation increases the cube count by 1, and each remove operation decreases it by 1.

So, the final number of cubes is a - r.

We want a - r = m.

But we also have a + r = n.

So, we have two equations:

1. a + r = n

2. a - r = m

We can solve these equations for a and r.

Adding both equations: 2a = n + m => a = (n + m)/2

Subtracting the second equation from the first: 2r = n - m => r = (n - m)/2

For a and r to be valid, they must be non-negative integers because you can't have a fraction of a move.

So, the conditions are:

1. (n + m)/2 is an integer.

2. (n - m)/2 is an integer.

3. a >= 0 and r >= 0, which implies:

- a = (n + m)/2 >= 0

- r = (n - m)/2 >= 0

But since n and m are both at least 1 according to the problem, and n can be greater than, equal to, or less than m, but in the program, it only checks if (n - m) is even and non-negative.

Wait, in the program, it checks if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0.

But according to our derivation, we have:

a = (n + m)/2

r = (n - m)/2

Both a and r need to be integers and non-negative.

So, for a to be an integer, (n + m) must be even.

For r to be an integer, (n - m) must be even.

Also, r >= 0 implies n - m >= 0, which is already checked in the program.

But what about a >= 0? That would be (n + m)/2 >= 0, which is always true since n and m are at least 1.

So, the program checks if (n - m) is even and non-negative, which corresponds to r being an integer and non-negative.

But it doesn't check if a is an integer, which depends on (n + m) being even.

Wait, in the program, it only checks (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0.

But according to our derivation, both (n - m) and (n + m) need to be even for a and r to be integers.

Let's see if (n - m) is even, does that imply (n + m) is even?

Yes, because:

If n - m is even, then n and m are both even or both odd.

If n and m are both even, then n + m is even.

If n and m are both odd, n + m is even.

So, if (n - m) is even, then (n + m) is also even.

Therefore, checking only (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0 is sufficient because if (n - m) is even, then (n + m) is also even.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Let's verify with some examples.

Example 1:

Input:

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

Output:

Yes

No

Yes

Let's see:

First test case: n=3, m=3

(n - m) = 0, which is even and >=0. So, Yes.

Second test case: n=2, m=4

(n - m) = -2, which is even but <0, so No.

Third test case: n=5, m=3

(n - m) = 2, which is even and >=0, so Yes.

This matches the expected output.

Let me think of some edge cases.

Edge Case 1:

n=1, m=1

(n - m) = 0, which is even and >=0, so Yes.

But, can Nikita build a tower with 1 cube in 1 move?

Yes, by adding one cube.

Edge Case 2:

n=1, m=0

(n - m) = 1, which is odd, so No.

But, can Nikita build a tower with 0 cubes in 1 move?

Yes, by removing one cube, but only if there is a cube to remove. Initially, there are no cubes, so removing one is not possible.

Hence, it should be No, which matches the program.

Edge Case 3:

n=2, m=0

(n - m) = 2, which is even and >=0, so Yes.

Possible sequence: add, remove.

Final cubes: 0.

Edge Case 4:

n=2, m=2

(n - m) = 0, which is even and >=0, so Yes.

Possible sequence: add, add.

Final cubes: 2.

Edge Case 5:

n=3, m=1

(n - m) = 2, which is even and >=0, so Yes.

Possible sequence: add, add, remove.

Final cubes: 1.

Edge Case 6:

n=4, m=2

(n - m) = 2, which is even and >=0, so Yes.

Possible sequence: add, add, add, remove.

Final cubes: 2.

Edge Case 7:

n=0, m=0

But n >=1 as per problem, so not needed.

Edge Case 8:

n=0, m=1

Not possible, but n >=1.

Edge Case 9:

n=1, m=2

(n - m) = -1, which is odd, so No.

Also makes sense because n=1, m=2: can't have 2 cubes with only 1 move.

Seems consistent.

Another way to think about it:

The maximum number of cubes Nikita can have after n moves is n (by adding a cube every move).

The minimum is max(0, n - 2*k), but since he can't remove more cubes than he has, it's constrained.

But in the program, it's sufficient to check (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0.

Given that, I think the program is correct.

I can't find any case where this logic fails.

Hence, Correctness: **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after performing `n` moves, where each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube from the tower.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We start with 0 cubes.
   - Each move can either add or remove one cube.
   - We need to achieve exactly `m` cubes in `n` moves.

2. **Insight**:
   - Let `a` be the number of add operations.
   - Let `r` be the number of remove operations.
   - We have two equations:
     1. `a + r = n` (total moves)
     2. `a - r = m` (net addition of cubes)
   
3. **Solution Derivation**:
   - Solving the equations:
     - `a = (n + m)/2`
     - `r = (n - m)/2`
   - For `a` and `r` to be valid, they must be non-negative integers.
   - Hence, `(n + m)` must be even, and `(n - m)` must be non-negative and even.

4. **Simplification**:
   - Since `(n - m)` being even implies `(n + m)` is even, we only need to check:
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`
     - `n - m >= 0`

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

kreker = int(input())
for _ in range(kreker):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation
- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases, `kreker`.
  - For each test case, read `n` and `m`.

- **Logic**:
  - Check if `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
  - If both conditions are satisfied, print 'Yes'; otherwise, print 'No'.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(1) per test case, making it suitable for the input constraints.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine whether it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves by leveraging simple arithmetic checks.
