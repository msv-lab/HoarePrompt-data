Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to maximize the "beauty" of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Sasha has an array of numbers, and he can rearrange them in any order he wants. The beauty is calculated by taking each pair of consecutive elements and subtracting the previous one from the current one, then summing all those differences up.

So, for an array a1, a2, a3, ..., an, beauty = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1})

If I look closely, this sum simplifies because most terms cancel out:

Beauty = a2 - a1 + a3 - a2 + a4 - a3 + ... + an - a_{n-1}

All intermediate terms cancel, leaving beauty = an - a1, where an is the last element and a1 is the first element in the rearranged array.

Wait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Is the maximum beauty just the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array?

Let me check with the example given:

Input:

5

3

2 1 3

Output:

2

In this case, rearranging to [1, 2, 3], beauty = (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the output.

Another example:

Input:

3

69 69 69

Output:

0

Rearranging doesn't change anything; all differences are zero.

Third example:

Input:

5

100 54 80 43 90

Output:

57

If I rearrange to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100], beauty = (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

Yes, which is the output given.

Fourth example:

Input:

4

3 4 3 3

Output:

1

Rearranging to [3,3,3,4], beauty = (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.

Fifth example:

Input:

2

2 1

Output:

1

Rearranging to [1,2], beauty = (2-1) = 1.

So, in all these cases, the beauty seems to be equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Wait, in the first example, max - min = 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the output.

Second example, all are 69, so 69 - 69 = 0.

Third example, 100 - 43 = 57.

Fourth example, 4 - 3 = 1.

Fifth example, 2 - 1 = 1.

So, it seems like the maximum beauty is always max(a) - min(a).

Looking at the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for e in range(t):

l = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

x = 0

y = 100000000

for i in range(l):

if nums[i] > x:

x = nums[i]

if nums[i] < y:

y = nums[i]

print(x - y)

This program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself. It then finds the maximum (x) and the minimum (y) of the array and prints their difference.

So, if the maximum beauty is indeed max(a) - min(a), then this program is correct.

But wait, I need to make sure that this is always the case.

Let me think about another example.

Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

If I arrange it as [1,2,3,4,5], beauty = (2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) + (5-4) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, which is 5 - 1 = 4.

Another arrangement: [1,3,5,2,4].

Beauty = (3-1) + (5-3) + (2-5) + (4-2) = 2 + 2 + (-3) + 2 = 3.

Which is less than 4.

Another arrangement: [5,4,3,2,1].

Beauty = (4-5) + (3-4) + (2-3) + (1-2) = -1 + -1 + -1 + -1 = -4.

Which is even smaller.

So, the maximum beauty seems to be achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order, and it's equal to the difference between the last and first elements.

Wait, but in the first example, it's [1,2,3], beauty = 2, which is 3 - 1 = 2.

In the arrangement [1,3,2], beauty = (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 + (-1) = 1, which is less than 2.

So, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum beauty.

But is there any arrangement where the beauty is greater than max - min?

I can't think of any.

Because, as shown earlier, the sum telescopes to the last element minus the first element, regardless of the arrangement.

Wait, but in the arrangement [1,2,3], beauty = 2.

In the arrangement [1,3,2], beauty = 1.

In [2,1,3], beauty = (1-2) + (3-1) = -1 + 2 = 1.

In [3,1,2], beauty = (1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = -1.

In [3,2,1], beauty = (2-3) + (1-2) = -1 + -1 = -2.

So, indeed, the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order, and it's equal to max - min.

Therefore, the program is correct.

But to be thorough, let's check another example.

Suppose the array is [10, 20, 30].

Arranged as [10,20,30], beauty = (20-10) + (30-20) = 10 + 10 = 20, which is 30 - 10 = 20.

Arranged as [10,30,20], beauty = (30-10) + (20-30) = 20 + (-10) = 10.

Arranged as [20,10,30], beauty = (10-20) + (30-10) = -10 + 20 = 10.

Arranged as [20,30,10], beauty = (30-20) + (10-30) = 10 + (-20) = -10.

Arranged as [30,20,10], beauty = (20-30) + (10-20) = -10 + (-10) = -20.

So, again, the maximum beauty is 20, which is max - min.

Another example: [5,5,5], beauty is always 0, which is 5 - 5 = 0.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
