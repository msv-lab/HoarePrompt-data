Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine the outcome of a game between Alice and Bob on a checkered board, given certain initial conditions and movement rules. The possible outcomes are "Alice" wins, "Bob" wins, or "Draw". The program needs to be evaluated for correctness, and if it's correct, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". Also, I need to follow a specific format in my answer.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem description thoroughly. Let's break it down.

We have a board with h rows and w columns. Alice starts at (x_a, y_a), and Bob starts at (x_b, y_b). They take turns moving their chips according to specific rules. Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left, while Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left. They can't move off the board, and the game ends immediately if a player lands on the same cell as the other player, with that player winning. If a player can't make a move—Alice if she's in the last row, Bob if he's in the first row—the game ends in a draw.

The program needs to determine the winner or if it's a draw, assuming both play optimally.

Looking at the program, it seems to handle multiple test cases, reading input values for each case and deciding the outcome based on certain conditions.

I need to verify if this program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner or draw for all possible scenarios based on the game rules.

To do this, I should consider various scenarios and see if the program handles them correctly. I should think about edge cases and typical cases to ensure the program's logic is sound.

Let me consider some scenarios:

1. **Alice starts in the last row:** Since Alice can't move, it's a draw.

2. **Bob starts in the first row:** Bob can't move, so it's a draw.

3. **Alice and Bob are on the same cell initially:** Not possible, as per the guarantee that initial positions don't coincide.

4. **Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position.**

5. **Bob can reach Alice's position before Alice can reach Bob's position.**

6. **Neither can reach the other, leading to a draw.**

I need to see if the program correctly identifies these scenarios.

Looking at the program, it seems to categorize cases based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob, particularly their row positions and column positions.

One thing that stands out is the condition `if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:` which corresponds to `if x_a > x_b or h == 1:`. In this case, it appends 'Draw'. This seems plausible because if Alice is already below Bob, she can't move up to reach him, and if h == 1, neither can move.

Then, there are conditions based on whether both x_a and x_b are even or both are odd, or one is even and the other is odd.

I need to verify if these conditions correctly capture the essence of the game.

Another thing to consider is the calculation involving absolute differences in column positions and half the difference in row positions.

For example, `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1` checks if the column difference is more than 1.

Also, `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` seems to be checking if the column difference minus one is greater than or equal to half the row difference.

These seem like attempts to calculate if Alice or Bob can reach each other's positions before the other does, considering their movement capabilities.

However, I'm not entirely confident about the correctness of these conditions. It might be better to model the problem differently.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory, where both players play optimally.

Since Alice moves first, she wants to reach Bob's position as quickly as possible, and Bob wants to reach Alice's position before she does.

Given their movement constraints, Alice can only move down and diagonally down-left or down-right, while Bob moves up and diagonally up-left or up-right.

I need to calculate the minimum number of moves for Alice to reach Bob's position and for Bob to reach Alice's position, and see who can do it faster.

If Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach her position, Alice wins. If Bob can reach Alice's position before Alice can reach his, Bob wins. If neither can reach the other, it's a draw.

But calculating the exact number of moves might be inefficient for large h and w, given the constraints.

Alternatively, since the movements are constrained to specific directions, I can model the possible positions Alice and Bob can reach and see if their paths can intersect before one of them is stuck.

But the program seems to have a different approach, based on conditions involving the row and column differences.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me consider some specific examples to test the program.

**Example 1:**

Input:

6 5 2 2 5 3

According to the example output, Alice wins.

Let's see why.

Alice starts at (2,2), Bob at (5,3).

Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left.

Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.

Alice needs to move up towards Bob, but she can't move up; she can only move down.

Wait, but according to the problem, Alice moves down, and Bob moves up.

So in this case, Alice is moving down, away from Bob, and Bob is moving up, away from Alice.

Unless there's a way for their paths to cross.

Wait, but in this specific example, the output is Alice, meaning she wins.

This seems counterintuitive based on the movement directions.

Wait, maybe I misread the directions.

Wait, actually, re-reading the problem:

Alice can move one cell down, or one cell down-right, or down-left.

Bob can move one cell up, up-right, or up-left.

So Alice moves down or diagonally down-left or down-right.

Bob moves up or diagonally up-left or up-right.

So their movements are in opposite directions.

In this scenario, for Alice to win, she needs to reach Bob's position before Bob can reach her position.

But given that they are moving towards each other, depending on their starting positions, one might be able to reach the other's position faster.

In this specific case, with h=6, w=5, Alice at (2,2), Bob at (5,3), it's possible that Alice can reach Bob's row before Bob can reach Alice's row, and position herself such that she lands on Bob's position.

But I need to think carefully about the possible moves.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to model this.

Let me consider the relative positions and the number of moves required.

The difference in rows between Alice and Bob is x_b - x_a = 5 - 2 = 3.

Alice needs to cover this distance by moving down; each move brings her down by one row.

Bob needs to cover the same distance but moving up.

However, since Alice moves first, she can make the first move down, reducing the row difference to 2, then Bob moves up, reducing it to 1, and then Alice moves down to the same row as Bob.

Then, in the same row, they can try to align their columns.

Given that they are in the same row, the one who can reach the other's column first wins.

In this case, when Alice reaches row 5, she is at column 2 + (5 - 2) * direction, but since she moves down, her column can change left or right accordingly.

Wait, I need to think more carefully.

Actually, Alice's column can change by at most one column per move when moving diagonally.

Similarly for Bob.

This seems complex to model directly.

Looking back at the program, it seems to handle different cases based on parity of rows and column differences.

But I'm not sure if this is the most straightforward way.

Perhaps I should consider the game as a race where both players are trying to minimize the distance to the other's position.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the minimum number of moves for Alice to reach Bob's position and for Bob to reach Alice's position, and see who can do it first.

Given that Alice moves first, if the number of moves Alice needs is less than or equal to Bob's moves, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

But I need to account for the fact that they are moving towards each other.

Wait, but in this game, Alice moves down and Bob moves up, so they are moving towards each other if Alice is below Bob, and away if Alice is above Bob.

Wait, in the example, Alice is at row 2, Bob at row 5, so Alice is moving down, away from Bob, and Bob is moving up, away from Alice.

So in this case, they are moving away from each other.

Then, how can Alice win in this scenario?

Unless there is a way for their paths to cross.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the column movements as well.

If Alice moves down-right or down-left, she can change columns while moving down.

Similarly, Bob can move up-right or up-left to change columns while moving up.

So, they can try to adjust their columns to match the other's column while moving towards their direction.

In the example, Alice starts at (2,2), Bob at (5,3).

Alice can try to adjust her column to 3 while moving down to row 5.

Similarly, Bob can try to adjust his column to 2 while moving up to row 2.

But since Alice moves first, she can try to reach row 5 before Bob reaches row 2.

Let me calculate the number of moves.

Alice is at row 2, needs to reach row 5; that's 3 moves down.

Bob is at row 5, needs to reach row 2; that's 3 moves up.

Since Alice moves first, she can make the first move, going to row 3.

Then Bob moves, going to row 4.

Then Alice moves to row 4.

Then Bob moves to row 3.

Then Alice moves to row 5.

Then Bob moves to row 2.

So, Alice reaches row 5 in 3 moves, and Bob reaches row 2 in 3 moves.

Now, they need to align their columns in these moves.

Initially, column difference is |2 - 3| = 1.

Alice can change her column by at most 1 per move (when moving diagonally).

Similarly, Bob can change his column by at most 1 per move.

So, in 3 moves, Alice can change her column by up to 3 positions.

But wait, she moves down 3 times, and each time she can move left or right by at most 1 per move.

Similarly, Bob moves up 3 times, changing column by at most 1 per move.

Wait, but in this specific case, Alice needs to reach column 3 from column 2 in 3 moves.

She can do this by moving down-right once and down twice, for example.

Similarly, Bob needs to reach column 2 from column 3 in 3 moves.

He can move up-left once and up twice.

But since they are moving simultaneously, I need to see if Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob reaches Alice's position.

Given that they both take the same number of moves to reach each other's starting rows, it's about whether they can align their columns in time.

In this case, the column difference is 1, and they have 3 moves to reduce the column difference to 0.

Since they can change columns by up to 1 per move, it's possible.

But according to the example output, Alice wins.

So, perhaps in this scenario, Alice can position herself in such a way that she reaches Bob's position before Bob reaches her position.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a strategy where Alice can force Bob into a position where Bob can't avoid being captured.

This is getting complicated.

Looking back at the program, it seems to have conditions based on the parity of the rows and the column differences.

But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.

Perhaps I should look for a different way to model the game.

Let me consider the game as a race where both players are trying to minimize the distance to the other's position.

The distance can be measured in terms of row difference and column difference.

Since Alice moves down and Bob moves up, the row difference decreases by 2 per turn (Alice moves down 1, Bob moves up 1).

Similarly, the column difference can change by up to 2 per turn (Alice moves left or right by 1, Bob moves left or right by 1).

But I need to think carefully about this.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the number of moves required for Alice to reach Bob's row and align her column with Bob's column, and similarly for Bob.

Then, compare who can do it faster.

If Alice can reach Bob's row and align her column before Bob can reach Alice's row and align his column, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

In the example, Alice needs 3 moves to reach row 5, and Bob needs 3 moves to reach row 2.

In those 3 moves, Alice can adjust her column by up to 3 positions (since she can change column by 1 per move).

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column by up to 3 positions.

Initially, the column difference is 1, so Alice can easily adjust her column to match Bob's in 1 move, but since she has 3 moves, she can do it.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column to match Alice's.

But since Alice moves first, perhaps she has an advantage.

Wait, but in this case, both can reach the other's row at the same time and adjust their columns accordingly.

It's not clear who would win in this scenario.

Given that the example output is "Alice", perhaps there is a specific strategy where Alice can force a win.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is incorrect, and this is a case where it should be a draw or Bob wins.

But according to the example output, it's Alice.

This makes me doubt the correctness of the program.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can reach Bob's row faster than Bob can reach Alice's row.

But in this case, both take the same number of moves.

Wait, perhaps if Alice can align her column within the moves she takes to reach Bob's row, she wins.

Similarly for Bob.

So, in this case, since both can align their columns within their moves, perhaps it's a race condition.

Given that Alice moves first, maybe she has the advantage.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a draw.

But according to the example, it's Alice.

Given that, perhaps the program is correct for this case.

Let me look at another example.

**Example 2:**

Input:

4 1 2 1 4 1

Output:

Bob

Here, h=4, w=1, Alice at (2,1), Bob at (4,1).

Since w=1, there's only one column.

Alice needs to move down to row 4, and Bob needs to move up to row 2.

The row difference is 2.

Alice moves down one row per move, Bob moves up one row per move.

Alice starts at row 2, Bob at row 4.

Alice moves down to row 3, Bob moves up to row 3.

Then Alice moves down to row 4, Bob moves up to row 2.

Wait, but row 4 is Alice's final position, and row 2 is Bob's final position.

They don't land on the same cell at any point.

So, it's a draw.

But according to the example output, it's Bob.

This confuses me.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the moves.

Let me try again.

Turn 1: Alice moves from row 2 to row 3.

Turn 2: Bob moves from row 4 to row 3.

Now, both are in row 3.

Since they are in the same row and same column, Bob wins because he landed on Alice's position.

Wait, but according to the rules, the player who lands on the other's position wins.

In this case, Bob lands on Alice's position in row 3, column 1.

So, Bob wins.

Hence, the output is "Bob", which matches the example.

Okay, that makes sense.

So, in this scenario, Bob wins because he reaches the same position as Alice before she can reach his position.

This suggests that the program is correct for this case.

Let me consider another example.

**Example 3:**

Input:

1 4 1 3 1 1

Output:

Draw

Here, h=1, w=4, Alice at (1,3), Bob at (1,1).

Since h=1, neither can move, so it's a draw.

This matches the program's condition where h == 1, so it appends 'Draw'.

Correct.

**Example 4:**

Input:

5 5 1 4 5 2

Output:

Draw

Let's see why.

Alice starts at (1,4), Bob at (5,2).

Alice needs to move down to row 5, and Bob needs to move up to row 1.

The row difference is 4.

Alice needs 4 moves to reach row 5, Bob needs 4 moves to reach row 1.

In these 4 moves, Alice can adjust her column by up to 4 positions (starting from column 4).

Bob can adjust his column by up to 4 positions (starting from column 2).

So, Alice can go from column 4 to column 2 in 2 moves (since she can change column by 1 per move).

Similarly, Bob can go from column 2 to column 4 in 2 moves.

But since they are moving towards each other, and both can adjust their columns accordingly, it's possible for them to meet at the same position at the same time.

But according to the output, it's a draw.

Perhaps because when they reach the same row, their column positions don't match, or they can't reach each other's positions in time.

Alternatively, maybe they reach the same position at the same time, resulting in a draw.

I need to think carefully.

Given that Alice moves first, she moves down to row 2, column can be 3, 4, or 5.

Then Bob moves up to row 4, column can be 1, 2, or 3.

And so on.

It's getting complicated to track.

Given that the output is "Draw", perhaps in this scenario, they can't capture each other before getting stuck.

**Example 5:**

Input:

4 4 1 1 4 4

Output:

Draw

Alice starts at (1,1), Bob at (4,4).

Alice needs to move down to row 4, Bob moves up to row 1.

The row difference is 3.

Alice needs 3 moves to reach row 4, Bob needs 3 moves to reach row 1.

In these 3 moves, Alice can adjust her column by up to 3 positions.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column by up to 3 positions.

Alice starts at column 1, needs to reach column 4; difference is 3.

So, in 3 moves, Alice can reach column 4.

Similarly, Bob starts at column 4, needs to reach column 1; difference is 3.

In 3 moves, Bob can reach column 1.

So, when they reach the target rows, their columns also match, leading to a capture.

But according to the output, it's a draw.

This suggests that perhaps they can't capture each other in time, or there's a way to avoid capture.

Given that, perhaps it's a draw because they reach the capture position at the same time.

**Example 6:**

Input:

10 10 1 6 10 8

Output:

Alice

Here, h=10, w=10, Alice at (1,6), Bob at (10,8).

Alice needs to move down 9 rows to reach row 10.

Bob needs to move up 9 rows to reach row 1.

So, it'll take 9 moves for Alice to reach row 10, and 9 moves for Bob to reach row 1.

In these 9 moves, Alice can adjust her column by up to 9 positions.

Similarly, Bob can adjust his column by up to 9 positions.

Initially, column difference is |6 - 8| = 2.

Alice needs to adjust her column by 2 positions to reach column 8.

Similarly, Bob needs to adjust his column by 7 positions to reach column 6 (from 8 to 6, difference is 2, but since he can move up to 9 positions, it's feasible).

Given that Alice moves first, she can reach row 10 in 9 moves and adjust her column to 8.

Bob can also reach row 1 in 9 moves and adjust his column to 6.

But according to the output, Alice wins.

Perhaps because Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach her position.

But in this scenario, both take the same number of moves to reach each other's rows and columns.

It's unclear why Alice wins in this case.

This makes me doubt the correctness of the program.

**Example 7:**

Input:

10 10 2 6 10 7

Output:

Draw

Similar to previous examples, but with different starting positions.

Again, it's complicated to track without a clear strategy.

**Example 8:**

Input:

10 10 9 1 8 1

Output:

Draw

Alice starts at (9,1), Bob at (8,1).

Alice needs to move down to row 10, but she's already in row 9.

Bob needs to move up to row 1, but he's in row 8.

It seems like Alice can reach row 10 in one move, and Bob can reach row 1 in 7 moves.

But since Alice can't move further once she reaches row 10, and Bob can't reach row 10 in time, perhaps it's a draw.

**Example 9:**

Input:

10 10 8 1 10 2

Output:

Bob

Here, Alice starts at (8,1), Bob at (10,2).

Alice needs to move down 2 rows to reach row 10.

Bob needs to move up 9 rows to reach row 1.

In 2 moves, Alice can reach row 10, and adjust her column to 2.

Bob can reach row 8 in 2 moves, but Alice has already reached row 10.

So, perhaps Alice can capture Bob if he is in row 10, column 2.

But according to the output, it's Bob.

This is confusing.

**Example 10:**

Input:

10 10 1 1 2 1

Output:

Alice

Alice starts at (1,1), Bob at (2,1).

Alice needs to move down to row 2 to capture Bob.

In one move, she can move down to row 2, column 1, capturing Bob.

Hence, Alice wins.

This matches the output.

**Example 11:**

Input:

10 10 1 3 4 1

Output:

Alice

Alice starts at (1,3), Bob at (4,1).

Alice needs to move down to row 4.

Row difference is 3.

In 3 moves, Alice can reach row 4, adjusting her column from 3 to 1.

Column difference is 2; in 3 moves, she can adjust by 2 columns.

Similarly, Bob needs to move up 3 rows to reach row 1, adjusting his column from 1 to 3.

But Alice moves first, so she can reach row 4 and column 1 before Bob can reach row 1 and column 3.

Hence, Alice wins.

**Example 12:**

Input:

10 10 3 1 1 1

Output:

Draw

Alice starts at (3,1), Bob at (1,1).

Alice needs to move down to row 10, but Bob is already in row 1.

Alice can reach row 10 in 7 moves, and Bob can't move down.

So, it's a draw.

This matches the output.

Given these observations, it seems that the program is correct for some cases but perhaps not for all.

Specifically, in Example 1 and Example 10, where Alice wins, it makes sense.

In Example 2, where Bob wins, it also makes sense.

In Example 3 and Example 8, where it's a draw, it makes sense.

However, in Example 4 and Example 5, where it's a draw, I'm not entirely sure why Alice can't win.

Similarly, in Example 6, where Alice wins, but based on my earlier analysis, it's not clear why.

This suggests that there might be some incorrect logic in the program.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the game mechanics.

Let me try to think differently.

Maybe I can model the game as a turn-based movement where each player tries to minimize the distance to the other.

Given that, I can calculate the minimum number of moves for Alice to reach Bob's position and for Bob to reach Alice's position.

If Alice can reach Bob's position in m moves, and Bob needs more than m moves to reach Alice's position, then Alice wins.

Similarly, if Bob can reach Alice's position in n moves, and Alice needs more than n moves, then Bob wins.

If neither can reach the other before the other is stuck, it's a draw.

Given that, I need to calculate the number of moves required for each to reach the other's position.

Given that Alice moves down and can adjust her column by at most 1 per move, and Bob moves up and can adjust his column by at most 1 per move.

So, for Alice to reach Bob's row, she needs (x_b - x_a) moves.

In those moves, she can adjust her column by up to (x_b - x_a) positions.

Similarly, for Bob to reach Alice's row, he needs (x_a - x_b) moves and can adjust his column accordingly.

Then, to reach the same column, the column difference should be within the adjustable range.

So, for Alice to reach Bob's position, she needs (x_b - x_a) moves, and the column difference should be <= (x_b - x_a).

Similarly, for Bob to reach Alice's position, he needs (x_a - x_b) moves, and the column difference should be <= (x_a - x_b).

Wait, but x_a and x_b differences might not be the same since Alice moves down and Bob moves up.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total number of moves.

Let me define:

- Moves for Alice to reach Bob's row: moves_a = x_b - x_a

- Moves for Bob to reach Alice's row: moves_b = x_a - x_b

But since they are moving towards each other, the relative speed in row reduction is moves_a + moves_b per turn.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of turns to close the row gap.

Each turn, the row difference decreases by 1 (Alice moves down 1, Bob moves up 1, so total row difference decreases by 2).

So, the number of turns to close the row difference is ceil((x_b - x_a)/2).

Similarly, during these turns, the column difference should be reduced accordingly.

This seems more promising.

Let me formalize this.

Let the initial row difference be d_row = x_b - x_a.

Similarly, initial column difference is d_col = |y_b - y_a|.

Each turn consists of Alice's move and Bob's move.

In each turn, the row difference decreases by 2 (Alice moves down 1, Bob moves up 1).

Additionally, both can adjust their columns by up to 1 per move.

So, in each turn, the column difference can be reduced by up to 2 (both adjust columns towards each other).

Hence, after t turns, the row difference is d_row - 2*t, and the column difference can be reduced by up to 2*t.

If d_row - 2*t == 0 and d_col <= 2*t, then the player who moves last wins.

Since Alice moves first, after t turns, Alice moves first in the last move if t is even, or Bob moves last if t is odd.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the game ends when the row difference is 0 and the column difference is 0.

So, we need to find the minimal t such that d_row - 2*t <= 0 and d_col - 2*t <= 0.

If d_row - 2*t <= 0 and d_col - 2*t <= 0, then the player who moves last wins.

Given that Alice moves first, the player who moves last is determined by the parity of t.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of who makes the last move.

Let me try to compute the minimal number of turns for Alice to reach Bob's position and for Bob to reach Alice's position.

For Alice to reach Bob's position:

- She needs to make t_a moves down to reach row x_b.

- In t_a moves, she can adjust her column by up to t_a positions.

- So, t_a = x_b - x_a, and d_col <= t_a.

Hence, t_a >= d_col.

Similarly, for Bob to reach Alice's position:

- He needs to make t_b moves up to reach row x_a.

- In t_b moves, he can adjust his column by up to t_b positions.

- So, t_b = x_a - x_b, and d_col <= t_b.

Hence, t_b >= d_col.

Now, since Alice moves first, she can choose to minimize t_a, and Bob minimizes t_b.

If t_a < t_b, Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob reaches Alice's position, so Alice wins.

If t_b <= t_a, Bob can reach Alice's position first or at the same time, so Bob wins.

But wait, in the example where h=6, w=5, x_a=2, y_a=2, x_b=5, y_b=3:

t_a = x_b - x_a = 3, d_col = 1 <= 3, so t_a = 3.

t_b = x_a - x_b = -3 (invalid, since x_a < x_b), so Bob can't reach Alice's row.

Hence, Alice wins.

This matches the example output.

In Example 2: h=4, w=1, x_a=2, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=1.

t_a = 2, d_col = 0 <= 2, so t_a = 2.

t_b = -2 (invalid), so Bob can't reach Alice's row.

Hence, Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the example output, it's Bob.

This suggests that my logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob is trying to reach Alice's position before Alice reaches his.

But in this case, since Bob can't reach Alice's row, it should be Alice wins.

But according to the example, it's Bob.

This indicates that my logic is flawed.

Perhaps I need to consider that Alice is moving down and Bob is moving up, and they can only meet when their row difference is closed to 0 and column difference is 0.

Wait, in the second example, h=4, w=1, x_a=2, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=1.

Alice moves down to row 3, then to row 4.

Bob moves up to row 3, then to row 2.

At some point, they are both in row 3, column 1, so Bob wins.

Hence, Bob wins in this scenario.

So, my earlier logic is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the relative movement.

The row difference decreases by 2 per turn (Alice moves down 1, Bob moves up 1).

The column difference can decrease by up to 2 per turn (both move towards each other in columns).

Hence, the number of turns to close both row and column differences is ceil(d_row / 2) and ceil(d_col / 2).

The actual number of turns needed is the maximum of these two.

If the maximum is an integer, and the row difference is exactly closed, then the player who moves last wins.

Since Alice moves first, if the number of turns is even, Alice moves last; if odd, Bob moves last.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me formalize.

Let t = max(ceil(d_row / 2), ceil(d_col / 2))

If t is an integer such that after t turns, row difference is <=0 and column difference is <=0, then the player who moves last wins.

Given that Alice moves first, if t is even, Alice moves last; if t is odd, Bob moves last.

Hence:

- If t is even and row difference <=0 and column difference <=0 after t turns, Alice wins.

- If t is odd and row difference <=0 and column difference <=0 after t turns, Bob wins.

- If it's not possible to have row difference <=0 and column difference <=0 within t turns, it's a draw.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic.

Let me test this with Example 2.

Example 2: h=4, w=1, x_a=2, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=1.

d_row = 2, d_col = 0.

t = max(ceil(2/2), ceil(0/2)) = max(1, 0) = 1.

After 1 turn, row difference is 0, column difference is 0.

t=1 is odd, so Bob moves last, hence Bob wins.

This matches the example output.

In Example 1: h=6, w=5, x_a=2, y_a=2, x_b=5, y_b=3.

d_row = 3, d_col =1.

t = max(ceil(3/2), ceil(1/2)) = max(2,1) =2.

After 2 turns, row difference is 3 - 4 = -1 <=0, column difference is 1 - 4 = -3 <=0.

t=2 is even, so Alice moves last, hence Alice wins.

This matches the example output.

In Example 3: h=1, w=4, x_a=1, y_a=3, x_b=1, y_b=1.

d_row =0, d_col=2.

t = max(0, ceil(2/2)) = max(0,1) =1.

After 1 turn, row difference is 0, column difference is 0 (since they can adjust columns by 1 each turn).

t=1 is odd, so Bob moves last, hence Bob wins.

But according to the example output, it's a draw.

This suggests that my logic is still incorrect.

Wait, but in this scenario, h=1, so Alice can't move at all.

Hence, it's a draw.

So, my earlier logic doesn't account for the constraints where players can't move beyond their boundaries.

Hence, I need to adjust my logic to consider that Alice can't move if she's in the last row, and Bob can't move if he's in the first row.

Hence, in Example 3, Alice is in row 1, which is not the last row (h=1), but wait, h=1, so Alice can't move down from row 1.

Hence, she can't move, and Bob can't move up from row 1.

Hence, it's a draw.

So, my previous logic doesn't account for this.

I need to refine my approach.

Let me consider the following:

- If x_a == h, Alice can't move, so it's a draw.

- If x_b ==1, Bob can't move, so it's a draw.

- Otherwise, calculate the number of turns t needed to close both row and column differences.

- t = max(ceil((x_b - x_a)/2), ceil(d_col / 2))

- If t is an integer such that after t turns, row difference <=0 and column difference <=0, then:

- If t is even, Alice wins.

- If t is odd, Bob wins.

- Else, it's a draw.

But in Example 3, x_a=1, h=1, so Alice can't move, hence draw.

In Example 2, t=1, odd, Bob wins.

In Example 1, t=2, even, Alice wins.

Seems consistent.

Another example: h=4, w=1, x_a=2, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=1.

t = max(ceil(2/2), ceil(0/2)) = max(1,0)=1, odd, Bob wins.

Matches Example 2.

Example 3: h=1, w=4, x_a=1, y_a=3, x_b=1, y_b=1.

Alice can't move, Bob can't move, draw.

Matches the output.

Another example: h=5, w=5, x_a=1, y_a=4, x_b=5, y_b=2.

d_row =4, d_col=2.

t = max(ceil(4/2), ceil(2/2)) = max(2,1)=2.

After 2 turns, row difference is 4-4=0, column difference is 2-4= -2.

t=2 even, Alice moves last, Alice wins.

But according to the example output, it's a draw.

This suggests that my logic is still incomplete.

Hence, there must be something wrong with this approach.

Perhaps I need to consider that in each turn, the row difference decreases by 2, but the column difference can decrease by up to 2 only if both players move towards each other in columns.

But they might choose to move in different directions, increasing the column difference.

Hence, to minimize the column difference, both need to move towards each other.

Hence, the column difference can decrease by up to 2 per turn.

Hence, the minimal number of turns to close the column difference is ceil(d_col / 2).

Similarly, the row difference decreases by 2 per turn.

Hence, t = max(ceil(d_row / 2), ceil(d_col / 2)).

Then, if t is an integer such that:

- row difference after t turns is <=0.

- column difference after t turns is <=0.

- and the player who moves last is the one who can capture.

Given that Alice moves first, if t is even, Alice moves last; if odd, Bob moves last.

Hence, in the case where t is even, Alice wins; if odd, Bob wins.

But in Example 4, h=5, w=5, x_a=1, y_a=4, x_b=5, y_b=2.

d_row=4, d_col=2.

t=max(2,1)=2.

Alice moves last, should win, but according to the example output, it's a draw.

Hence, perhaps there's an additional constraint.

Perhaps, in addition to t being an integer and row and column differences being <=0, we need to ensure that the row positions don't go beyond the board boundaries.

Wait, in this case, Alice needs to move down 4 rows, but h=5, so from row 1 to row 5 in 4 moves.

Bob needs to move up 4 rows from row 5 to row 1 in 4 moves.

But according to t=2, which is based on ceil(d_row / 2) and ceil(d_col / 2).

This seems inconsistent.

I think my earlier approach is flawed.

Let me try another approach.

Let me consider the game as a race where both players are trying to minimize the distance to the other's position.

I can calculate the number of turns required for Alice to reach Bob's position and for Bob to reach Alice's position.

If Alice can reach Bob's position in fewer turns than Bob can reach Alice's position, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

But I need to account for the fact that they are moving simultaneously.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of meeting point.

They can meet when their row difference is closed to 0 and column difference is 0.

Given that, I can calculate the minimal number of turns required to close both differences.

Given that row difference decreases by 2 per turn, and column difference decreases by up to 2 per turn.

Hence, the number of turns required is ceil(d_row / 2) and ceil(d_col / 2), and we take the maximum of these two.

Then, if after t turns, row difference is <=0 and column difference is <=0, the player who moves last wins.

Given that Alice moves first, if t is even, Alice moves last; if odd, Bob moves last.

Hence, in the previous example, t=2, even, Alice wins.

But according to the example
