Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between chosen cells in an n x n grid. The problem provides some examples and notes to understand what's expected.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. We are given an integer n, which defines the size of the grid (n x n). We have to choose n cells in this grid and maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these chosen cells.

The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

The program provided seems to handle different cases based on the value of n. Let's look at the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

So, the function reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads n and then prints a specific set of cells.

Let's analyze this step by step.

For n=2:

- It prints (1,1), (1,2)

According to the example, this is correct, and it achieves the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances, which is 2: 0 and 1.

For n=3:

- It prints (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

From the example, this seems correct, achieving distinct distances of 0,1,2,3.

For n=4:

- It prints (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and then (4,4)

From the note, a possible arrangement is given, but I need to check if this arrangement also maximizes the number of distinct distances.

For n>=4:

- It prints (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and then for each j from 4 to n, it prints (j,j).

I need to verify if this always maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

First, let's think about the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances.

In an n x n grid, the possible Manhattan distances range from 0 up to 2(n-1). However, not all values in this range may be achievable depending on the cell selections.

Given that we have to choose n cells, we need to select them in such a way that the number of distinct distances between any two chosen cells is maximized.

Let me consider small values of n to see if the program's output matches the expected maximum.

For n=2:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2)

- Distances: |1-1| + |1-1| = 0, |1-1| + |2-1| = 1, |1-1| + |2-2| = 0

- Distinct distances: {0,1}

- Is this the maximum? For n=2, the maximum possible is 2, which seems correct.

For n=3:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- Calculate all pairwise distances:

- (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- (1,1) and (2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2) and (2,3): |1-2| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Distinct distances: {0,1,2,3}

- Wait, where does 0 come from? Only if a cell is compared to itself, but since we're choosing distinct cells, distances should be positive. But according to the problem, it includes distances between the same cells, which would be 0.

- So, including 0, the distinct set is {0,1,2,3}.

- Is this the maximum? For n=3, is it possible to get more than 4 distinct distances? Let's see.

- Total possible distinct distances in a 3x3 grid: from 0 to 4 (2*(3-1) = 4).

- So, {0,1,2,3,4} is possible?

- But in this selection, we don't have distance 4.

- Is there a way to select 3 cells to get distances 0,1,2,3,4?

- Let's try: select (1,1), (1,3), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,3): |1-1| + |1-3| = 2

- (1,1)-(3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,3)-(3,3): |1-3| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2

- Distances: {0,2,4}

- Not better than previous.

- Another try: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,2): |1-2| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- (1,1)-(3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4

- (2,2)-(3,3): |2-3| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Distances: {0,2,4}

- Another try: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- Distances: {0,1,2,3} as in the program's output.

- Seems 4 distinct distances is the maximum for n=3.

So, for n=3, the program's output is correct.

For n=4:

- Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

- Calculate distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): |1-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,2)-(2,4): |1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): |1-4| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5

- (2,4)-(4,4): |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2

- Distinct distances: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

- Possible maximum for n=4: 2*(4-1) = 6, plus 0, which is 7 distinct distances.

- Does this selection achieve that? Yes, {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} has 7 distinct distances.

- Is it possible to get more? The maximum possible is 7, so this is optimal.

For n=5:

- Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

- Calculate distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,2)-(2,4): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): 4 + 3 = 7

- (2,4)-(4,4): 2 + 0 = 2

- (2,4)-(5,5): 3 + 1 = 4

- (4,4)-(5,5): 1 + 1 = 2

- Distinct distances: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

- This gives 9 distinct distances.

- Possible maximum for n=5: 2*(5-1) = 8, plus 0, so 9 distinct distances.

- So, this selection achieves the maximum.

For n=6:

- Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

- Calculate distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,1)-(6,6): 5 + 5 = 10

- (1,2)-(2,4): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): 4 + 3 = 7

- (1,2)-(6,6): 5 + 4 = 9

- (2,4)-(4,4): 2 + 0 = 2

- (2,4)-(5,5): 3 + 1 = 4

- (2,4)-(6,6): 4 + 2 = 6

- (4,4)-(5,5): 1 + 1 = 2

- (4,4)-(6,6): 2 + 2 = 4

- (5,5)-(6,6): 1 + 1 = 2

- Distinct distances: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}

- This gives 11 distinct distances.

- Possible maximum for n=6: 2*(6-1) = 10, plus 0, so 11 distinct distances.

- Thus, this selection is optimal.

From these observations, it seems that the program's approach works for n from 2 to 6, which matches the examples provided.

Now, let's generalize this for any n.

The program's logic is:

- Always select (1,1) and (1,2).

- For n=3, select (2,3).

- For n>=4, select (2,4) and then for each j from 4 to n, select (j,j).

I need to verify if this selection always maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Let me consider n=7:

- Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,1)-(6,6): 5 + 5 = 10

- (1,1)-(7,7): 6 + 6 = 12

- (1,2)-(2,4): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): 4 + 3 = 7

- (1,2)-(6,6): 5 + 4 = 9

- (1,2)-(7,7): 6 + 5 = 11

- (2,4)-(4,4): 2 + 0 = 2

- (2,4)-(5,5): 3 + 1 = 4

- (2,4)-(6,6): 4 + 2 = 6

- (2,4)-(7,7): 5 + 3 = 8

- (4,4)-(5,5): 1 + 1 = 2

- (4,4)-(6,6): 2 + 2 = 4

- (4,4)-(7,7): 3 + 3 = 6

- (5,5)-(6,6): 1 + 1 = 2

- (5,5)-(7,7): 2 + 2 = 4

- (6,6)-(7,7): 1 + 1 = 2

- Distinct distances: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}

- This gives 13 distinct distances.

- Possible maximum for n=7: 2*(7-1) = 12, plus 0, so 13 distinct distances.

- Thus, this selection is optimal.

It seems consistent up to n=7.

Now, let's consider n=1000, as per the problem constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).

- Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and then (4,4), (5,5), ..., (1000,1000)

- This selection should also maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

- The distances would range from 0 up to |1-1000| + |1-1000| = 1998, with various steps in between.

- Given the pattern, it seems that this selection would cover all possible distances from 0 up to 2(n-1), which is the maximum possible.

Therefore, the program's approach seems to be correct for various values of n, including small and large ones.

Additionally, the program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading t and processing each test case individually.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases within the given constraints.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
