Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between chosen cells in an n x n grid. The program provided seems to have a function that, for each test case, prints n points in the grid.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Given an integer n, I need to choose n cells in an n x n grid such that the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these cells is maximized. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

Looking at the examples provided:

- For n=2, the output is (1,1) and (1,2), which gives Manhattan distances of 0 and 1.

- For n=3, the output is (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which gives distances of 0, 2, 1, and 3.

- For n=4, n=5, and n=6, similar sets of points are provided.

The program provided seems to follow a pattern: it always prints (1,1), (1,2), and then for each subsequent cell, it prints (i,i) for i from 3 to n.

So, for n=3, it would print:

1 1

1 2

3 3

But in the example, for n=3, it's:

2 1

2 3

3 1

Hmm, that's different from what the program is doing. So, there might be multiple correct ways to choose the cells, but the program seems to have a specific approach.

I need to verify if the program's approach always maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Let me think about the general case.

In an n x n grid, the possible Manhattan distances range from 0 up to 2(n-1). However, not all these distances may be achievable with only n points.

The program's strategy seems to be:

- Place the first two points on the same row, specifically (1,1) and (1,2).

- For each subsequent point, place it on the diagonal, i.e., (i,i) for i from 3 to n.

I need to check if this strategy maximizes the number of distinct distances for any n.

Let me consider n=2:

Points: (1,1) and (1,2)

Distances: |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 and |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

So, distances are 0 and 1, which matches the example.

For n=3:

Program's output: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Between (1,1) and (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4

- Between (1,2) and (3,3): |1-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3

So, distances are 1, 3, and 4.

But in the example, for n=3, the output is (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), which gives distances 0, 2, 1, and 3.

Wait, the example has distances 0,1,2,3, but the program's output for n=3 gives distances 1,3,4.

So, the program's output has distances 1,3,4, which are three distinct distances, while the example achieves four distinct distances.

Does that mean the program's approach is not optimal for n=3?

Wait, but maybe for n=3, both are acceptable since the task is to maximize the size of H, and if there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum, any can be outputted.

But in this case, the example achieves four distinct distances, while the program achieves three.

Is four the maximum possible for n=3?

Let me see: in a 3x3 grid, the possible distances are 0,1,2,3,4.

With three points, what's the maximum number of distinct distances?

If I choose points (1,1), (1,2), (1,3):

Distances: 0 (between identical points), 1 (between adjacent points), 2 (between corners).

So, distances are 0,1,2.

But in the example, they have 0,1,2,3.

Wait, how is that possible?

Let's calculate the distances for the example's n=3 output: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- Between (2,1) and (2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

- Between (2,1) and (3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1

- Between (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

So, distances are 1,2,3.

Wait, the note says it's {0,1,2,3}, but where does the 0 come from?

Probably, it's considering the distance of a point to itself, which is 0.

But in the problem statement, it says "between any pair of cells", which likely excludes the distance from a cell to itself.

But in the note, it includes 0.

Maybe the problem considers distances between any two cells, including the same cell.

In that case, for n=3, the example has distances {0,1,2,3}, while the program's output has {0,1,3,4}.

Wait, the program's output for n=3 would include 0 for each point to itself.

So, the program's H would be {0,1,3,4}, which is four distinct distances, same as the example.

But in the example, they have {0,1,2,3}, and the program has {0,1,3,4}.

So, both have four distinct distances.

Is four the maximum possible for n=3?

Let's see if we can get five distinct distances for n=3.

Is it possible to have five distinct distances with three points in a 3x3 grid?

The possible distances are 0,1,2,3,4.

If we choose points such that they yield distances 0,1,2,3,4.

Is that possible?

Let's try points (1,1), (1,2), and (3,3).

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Between (1,1) and (3,3): 4

- Between (1,2) and (3,3): 3

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0,1,3,4.

Missing distance 2.

Alternatively, points (1,1), (2,1), (3,2).

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (2,1): 1

- Between (1,1) and (3,2): |1-3| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3

- Between (2,1) and (3,2): |2-3| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0,1,2,3.

This gives four distinct distances, same as the example and the program's output.

Is there a way to get five distinct distances with three points?

Let's see:

Points (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Between (1,1) and (2,1): 1

- Between (1,2) and (2,1): 1

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0 and 1.

Only two distinct distances.

Alternatively, points (1,1), (1,3), (3,1)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,3): 2

- Between (1,1) and (3,1): 2

- Between (1,3) and (3,1): 4

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0,2,4.

Only three distinct distances.

So, it seems that with three points, the maximum number of distinct distances is four.

And both the example and the program's output achieve four distinct distances.

Hence, for n=3, the program's approach is correct.

Now, let's check for n=4.

Program's output for n=4:

(1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Between (1,1) and (3,3): 4

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): 7

- Between (1,2) and (3,3): 3

- Between (1,2) and (4,4): 6

- Between (3,3) and (4,4): 2

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0,1,2,3,4,6,7.

That's seven distinct distances.

In the example for n=4, the output is:

1 1

1 3

4 3

4 4

Let's compute the distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,3): 2

- Between (1,1) and (4,3): 5

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): 6

- Between (1,3) and (4,3): 3

- Between (1,3) and (4,4): 4

- Between (4,3) and (4,4): 1

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Also seven distinct distances.

So, both approaches achieve seven distinct distances for n=4.

Is seven the maximum possible for n=4?

Let me see: in a 4x4 grid, the maximum possible Manhattan distance is 6 (from (1,1) to (4,4)).

But with four points, can we get more than seven distinct distances?

Probably not, since there are only six pairwise distances plus the zeros.

Hence, seven distinct distances seem to be the maximum for n=4.

Thus, the program's approach works for n=4.

Now, let's check for n=5.

Program's output for n=5:

(1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Between (1,1) and (3,3): 4

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): 7

- Between (1,1) and (5,5): 10

- Between (1,2) and (3,3): 3

- Between (1,2) and (4,4): 6

- Between (1,2) and (5,5): 9

- Between (3,3) and (4,4): 2

- Between (3,3) and (5,5): 5

- Between (4,4) and (5,5): 2

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9,10.

That's nine distinct distances.

Looking at the example for n=5:

1 1

1 3

1 4

2 1

5 5

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,3): 2

- Between (1,1) and (1,4): 3

- Between (1,1) and (2,1): 1

- Between (1,1) and (5,5): 8

- Between (1,3) and (1,4): 1

- Between (1,3) and (2,1): 3

- Between (1,3) and (5,5): 6

- Between (1,4) and (2,1): 4

- Between (1,4) and (5,5): 5

- Between (2,1) and (5,5): 7

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Also nine distinct distances.

So, both approaches achieve nine distinct distances for n=5.

Is nine the maximum possible for n=5?

In a 5x5 grid, the maximum Manhattan distance is 8 (from (1,1) to (5,5)).

With five points, the number of pairwise distances is 10, plus the zeros.

But since distances are symmetric, some distances might repeat.

Hence, nine distinct distances seem achievable, and perhaps optimal.

Thus, the program's approach works for n=5.

Finally, for n=6.

Program's output for n=6:

(1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Between (1,1) and (3,3): 4

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): 7

- Between (1,1) and (5,5): 10

- Between (1,1) and (6,6): 13

- Between (1,2) and (3,3): 3

- Between (1,2) and (4,4): 6

- Between (1,2) and (5,5): 9

- Between (1,2) and (6,6): 12

- Between (3,3) and (4,4): 2

- Between (3,3) and (5,5): 5

- Between (3,3) and (6,6): 8

- Between (4,4) and (5,5): 2

- Between (4,4) and (6,6): 5

- Between (5,5) and (6,6): 2

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13.

That's twelve distinct distances.

Looking at the example for n=6:

1 4

1 5

1 6

5 2

6 1

Distances:

- Between (1,4) and (1,5): 1

- Between (1,4) and (1,6): 2

- Between (1,4) and (5,2): 5

- Between (1,4) and (6,1): 8

- Between (1,5) and (1,6): 1

- Between (1,5) and (5,2): 4

- Between (1,5) and (6,1): 7

- Between (1,6) and (5,2): 3

- Between (1,6) and (6,1): 6

- Between (5,2) and (6,1): 2

- Between (5,2) and (6,1): 2

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

That's nine distinct distances.

But the program's approach achieves twelve distinct distances.

Is twelve the maximum possible for n=6?

In a 6x6 grid, the maximum Manhattan distance is 10 (from (1,1) to (6,6)).

With six points, there are 15 pairwise distances, plus the zeros.

So, it's possible to have up to eleven distinct distances (0 through 10).

But the program achieves twelve distinct distances, which seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps some distances repeat.

Wait, in the program's output, distances are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13.

But in a 6x6 grid, the maximum distance is 10, so distances 12 and 13 are not possible.

Wait, is that right?

The grid is n=6, so coordinates from 1 to 6.

Maximum Manhattan distance is |1-6| + |1-6| = 5 + 5 = 10.

So, distances 12 and 13 cannot occur.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it's trying to include distances greater than the maximum possible.

Wait, but in the program's output for n=6, it's placing points on the diagonal: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6).

But wait, (1,2) is not on the diagonal; the diagonal is (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), etc.

Wait, the program prints (1,1), (1,2), then for i from 3 to n, it prints (i,i).

So, for n=6, it's (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6).

Now, let's compute the distance between (1,1) and (6,6): |1-6| + |1-6| = 5 + 5 = 10.

Distance between (1,2) and (6,6): |1-6| + |2-6| = 5 + 4 = 9.

Distance between (3,3) and (6,6): |3-6| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6.

And so on.

So, all distances are within 0 to 10.

So, no distance exceeds 10.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought distances could be up to 13, but that's not possible in a 6x6 grid.

Hence, the program's output for n=6 is correct in terms of distance values.

Moreover, it achieves twelve distinct distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Wait, earlier I listed 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13, but considering the grid size, distances 12 and 13 are impossible.

So, perhaps I miscalculated the distances.

Wait, in a 6x6 grid, the maximum distance is 10, as |1-6| + |1-6| = 10.

So, distances 12 and 13 cannot occur.

Therefore, the program's output for n=6 is correct.

Hence, for n=6, the program achieves the maximum possible distinct distances.

So, from n=2 to n=6, the program seems to work correctly.

Now, I need to consider if this approach works for all n between 2 and 10^3.

The program's approach is:

- Always place the first two points at (1,1) and (1,2).

- Then, for each subsequent point, place it on the diagonal at (i,i).

Is this approach optimal for any n?

From the above analysis for n=2 to n=6, it seems to work.

Is there any n where this approach fails to maximize the number of distinct distances?

Let me consider n=2:

Achieves 2 distinct distances: 0 and 1.

Seems optimal.

n=3:

Achieves 4 distinct distances: 0,1,3,4.

Is there a way to achieve more than 4?

From earlier analysis, no.

n=4:

Achieves 7 distinct distances: 0,1,2,3,4,6,7.

Is there a way to achieve more than 7?

Probably not.

n=5:

Achieves 9 distinct distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10.

Is there a way to achieve more than 9?

Maybe not.

n=6:

Achieves 11 distinct distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Which is the maximum possible.

So, for n=2 to n=6, the approach works.

What about larger n?

Let's consider n=7.

Program's output:

(1,1), (1,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- Between (1,1) and (3,3): 4

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): 7

- Between (1,1) and (5,5): 10

- Between (1,1) and (6,6): 13

- Between (1,1) and (7,7): 16

- Between (1,2) and (3,3): 3

- Between (1,2) and (4,4): 6

- Between (1,2) and (5,5): 9

- Between (1,2) and (6,6): 12

- Between (1,2) and (7,7): 15

- Between (3,3) and (4,4): 2

- Between (3,3) and (5,5): 5

- Between (3,3) and (6,6): 8

- Between (3,3) and (7,7): 11

- Between (4,4) and (5,5): 2

- Between (4,4) and (6,6): 5

- Between (4,4) and (7,7): 8

- Between (5,5) and (6,6): 2

- Between (5,5) and (7,7): 5

- Between (6,6) and (7,7): 2

- Each point to itself: 0

So, distances are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16.

That's fifteen distinct distances.

In a 7x7 grid, the maximum Manhattan distance is 12 (|1-7| + |1-7| = 12).

So, distances can be from 0 to 12.

But the program's approach achieves distances up to 16, which is impossible.

Wait, in a 7x7 grid, the maximum distance is 12, as |1-7| + |1-7| = 12.

So, distances 13,15,16 cannot occur.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distances.

Wait, between (1,1) and (7,7): |1-7| + |1-7| = 6 + 6 = 12.

Similarly, between (1,2) and (7,7): |1-7| + |2-7| = 6 + 5 = 11.

Between (1,1) and (6,6): |1-6| + |1-6| = 5 + 5 = 10.

Between (1,2) and (6,6): |1-6| + |2-6| = 5 + 4 = 9.

And so on.

So, the maximum distance is 12, and the program's approach achieves distances up to 12.

Earlier, I mistakenly calculated |1-7| as 6, but it's actually 6, since 7-1=6.

Hence, distances are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12.

That's twelve distinct distances.

Is twelve the maximum possible for n=7?

In a 7x7 grid, there are 28 pairwise distances (n choose 2 = 21, plus n zeros).

But considering the symmetry of distances, it's unlikely to get more than 13 distinct distances.

But in this case, the program achieves 12 distinct distances.

Is there a better arrangement that achieves more?

Probably not.

Hence, the program's approach seems optimal for n=7.

Similarly
