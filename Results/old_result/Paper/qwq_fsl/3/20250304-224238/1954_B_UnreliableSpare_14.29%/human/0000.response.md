Alright, I've been assigned this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The goal is to determine whether the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". It's important to note that partial correctness isn't acceptable; the program must handle every potential case correctly to be considered correct.

To approach this, I need to thoroughly understand both the problem description and the provided program. I'll start by carefully reading the problem description to grasp what is being asked.

### Problem Description

We are given an array that is described as "beautiful." A beautiful array is one where, through a series of specific operations, all its elements can be made the same. The operation allowed is:

- Choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \), and replace \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).

The task is to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from this beautiful array so that it no longer remains beautiful. If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, the output should be -1.

### Key Points from the Problem

1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if, by repeatedly applying the specified operation, all elements can be made equal.
2. **Operation Allowed**: Only elements at positions where their immediate neighbors are equal can be changed to match those neighbors.
3. **Goal**: Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful, or output -1 if it's impossible.

### Provided Program

The program provided is as follows:

```python
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            val = arr[i]
            cnt = 1
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)
```

### Analysis of the Program

First, I need to understand what the program is doing and whether it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Checking if all elements are already equal**:
    - The program sets a `flag` to `True` and checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, `flag` remains `True`.
    - If `flag` is `True`, it prints `-1`, which aligns with the requirement that if the array is already uniform, it's impossible to make it non-beautiful.

2. **Calculating the minimum number of removals**:
    - If the array has at least two different elements, it initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates through the array to find the minimum frequency of any element.
    - It seems to track the count of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element (`val`), and updates `ans` with the minimum count of such sequences.

However, this approach seems flawed because:

- The problem is not just about finding the least frequent element or the shortest sequence of a particular value.
- The beauty of an array is defined based on the ability to make all elements equal by replacing certain elements under specific conditions.
- Removing elements to break this property requires understanding the structure that allows the array to be made uniform.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand the condition under which an array can be made beautiful.

- **Observation**: For an array to be beautiful, it must be possible to make all elements equal by repeatedly replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) (or \( a_{i+1} \)) where \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

This operation allows us to fix elements that are different from their neighbors, provided their neighbors are equal.

- **Insight**: An array is beautiful if and only if all its elements are the same, or it alternates between two values in a specific pattern.

Wait, that might not be accurate. Let's think differently.

- Consider that if the array has sections where elements are already equal, and the differing elements are in positions where they can be changed according to the operation, then the array is beautiful.

- To make the array not beautiful, we need to disrupt this property.

### Correct Solution Idea

- **Uniform Array**: If all elements are the same, removing any single element still keeps the array beautiful because all remaining elements are equal.

- **Non-Uniform Array**: If the array has at least two different elements, we need to find the minimal disruption (removals) that prevents the array from being made uniform via the allowed operations.

- **Key Insight**: The array is beautiful if it's possible to make all elements equal by changing elements that are sandwiched between two equal elements.

- To break this property, we need to ensure that after removals, it's impossible to make all elements equal via these operations.

### Potential Missteps in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**:
    - The program seems to find the minimum frequency of any element in the array, which doesn't directly correlate with making the array non-beautiful.
    - This approach doesn't consider the specific operation allowed to make the array beautiful.

2. **Misunderstanding of Array Beauty**:
    - The beauty of an array isn't solely dependent on the frequency of elements but on the structure and the ability to perform the specified operations to uniformize it.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program doesn't correctly address the problem as per the description. It seems to have a misunderstanding of what makes an array beautiful and how to determine the minimal removals to disrupt that property.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
