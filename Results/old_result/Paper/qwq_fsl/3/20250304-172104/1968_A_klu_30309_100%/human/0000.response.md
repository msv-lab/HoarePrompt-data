Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to find an integer y (1 ≤ y < x) for a given integer x, such that the sum of y and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y is maximized. The program needs to do this for multiple test cases.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. We are given multiple values of x, and for each x, we need to find a y that is less than x, and the sum of y and GCD(x, y) is as large as possible. If there are multiple y's that satisfy this condition, we can choose any of them.

Looking at the example input and output:

Input:

7

10

7

21

100

2

1000

6

Output:

5

6

18

98

1

750

3

So for x=10, y=5 gives GCD(10,5)=5, so 5 + 5 = 10.

For x=7, y=6 gives GCD(7,6)=1, so 6 + 1 = 7.

For x=21, y=18 gives GCD(21,18)=3, so 18 + 3 = 21.

For x=100, y=98 gives GCD(100,98)=2, so 98 + 2 = 100.

For x=2, y=1 gives GCD(2,1)=1, so 1 + 1 = 2.

For x=1000, y=750 gives GCD(1000,750)=250, so 750 + 250 = 1000.

For x=6, y=3 gives GCD(6,3)=3, so 3 + 3 = 6.

In all these cases, the sum y + GCD(x, y) equals x. Is that always the case?

Well, let's think about it. The maximum possible sum would be y + GCD(x, y). Since y < x, and GCD(x, y) can be at most y if y divides x, but usually it's smaller.

Wait, no. GCD(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y. So, y + GCD(x, y) will be maximized when both y and GCD(x, y) are as large as possible.

Given that y < x, the largest y can be is x - 1. But GCD(x, x - 1) is usually 1, because consecutive integers are co-prime. So, y + GCD(x, y) would be (x - 1) + 1 = x.

But in some cases, y can be less than x - 1 but have a higher GCD, which might result in a higher sum.

Wait, for example, take x=10.

y=5: GCD(10,5)=5 → 5 + 5 = 10

y=9: GCD(10,9)=1 → 9 + 1 = 10

y=8: GCD(10,8)=2 → 8 + 2 = 10

y=7: GCD(10,7)=1 → 7 + 1 = 8

y=6: GCD(10,6)=2 → 6 + 2 = 8

y=5: GCD(10,5)=5 → 5 + 5 = 10

So, the maximum sum is 10, achieved by y=5, y=8, y=9.

Similarly, for x=7:

y=6: GCD(7,6)=1 → 6 + 1 = 7

y=5: GCD(7,5)=1 → 5 + 1 = 6

y=4: GCD(7,4)=1 → 4 + 1 = 5

y=3: GCD(7,3)=1 → 3 + 1 = 4

y=2: GCD(7,2)=1 → 2 + 1 = 3

y=1: GCD(7,1)=1 → 1 + 1 = 2

So, the maximum sum is 7, achieved by y=6.

Similarly, for x=21, y=18: GCD(21,18)=3 → 18 + 3 = 21

But y=20 would be GCD(21,20)=1 → 20 + 1 = 21

y=19: GCD(21,19)=1 → 19 + 1 = 20

So, y=18 is acceptable, but y=20 would also give the same sum.

Wait, but x=21, y=18 is chosen, which is not x-1, but still gives the sum of 21.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98: GCD(100,98)=2 → 98 + 2 = 100

y=99: GCD(100,99)=1 → 99 + 1 = 100

y=95: GCD(100,95)=5 → 95 + 5 = 100

So, multiple y's can achieve the maximum sum, which is x.

For x=2, y=1: GCD(2,1)=1 → 1 + 1 = 2

For x=1000, y=750: GCD(1000,750)=250 → 750 + 250 = 1000

For x=6, y=3: GCD(6,3)=3 → 3 + 3 = 6

Again, the sum is x.

So, it seems that the maximum sum y + GCD(x, y) is always x, and any y that achieves this sum is acceptable.

But is this always true?

Let's consider x=4.

Possible y's:

y=3: GCD(4,3)=1 → 3 + 1 = 4

y=2: GCD(4,2)=2 → 2 + 2 = 4

y=1: GCD(4,1)=1 → 1 + 1 = 2

So, y=3 and y=2 both achieve the sum of 4.

So, for x=4, any y that is a divisor of x or x-1 works.

Wait, y=3 is x-1, and y=2 is a divisor of x.

Similarly, for x=9:

y=8: GCD(9,8)=1 → 8 + 1 = 9

y=6: GCD(9,6)=3 → 6 + 3 = 9

y=3: GCD(9,3)=3 → 3 + 3 = 6

y=2: GCD(9,2)=1 → 2 + 1 = 3

y=1: GCD(9,1)=1 → 1 + 1 = 2

So, y=8 and y=6 both achieve the sum of 9.

So, it seems that y=x-1 or y=x - k where k is a divisor of x.

Wait, y=x-1 always gives GCD(x, x-1)=1, so y + GCD(x, y)=x-1 + 1 = x.

Similarly, y=x - d, where d is a divisor of x, would give GCD(x, y)=d, so y + d = x - d + d = x.

So, any y=x - d, where d is a divisor of x, will give y + GCD(x, y)=x.

And y=x-1 is a special case where d=1.

So, to maximize y + GCD(x, y), we can choose y=x - d, where d is a divisor of x, and among such y's, we can choose the largest y, which corresponds to the smallest d.

But d must be at least 1, so y=x-1 is always an option, giving y + GCD(x, y)=x.

But in some cases, choosing a smaller d (i.e., a larger y) might be better, but in practice, it seems that y + GCD(x, y)=x is achievable for multiple y's.

So, the problem allows us to choose any y that achieves this maximum sum.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```

import math

t = int(input())

test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]

results = func_1(t, test_cases)

for result in results:

print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):

results = []

for x in test_cases:

max_sum = 0

best_y = 1

for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):

gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)

current_sum = gcd_val + y

if current_sum > max_sum:

max_sum = current_sum

best_y = y

break

results.append(best_y)

return results

```

So, the program reads the number of test cases t, then reads t integers x, and then processes each x using the function func_1.

In func_1, for each x, it initializes max_sum to 0 and best_y to 1.

Then, it loops through y from x-1 down to 1, and for each y, calculates GCD(x, y), computes the sum y + GCD(x, y), and if this sum is greater than the current max_sum, it updates max_sum and sets best_y to this y.

Then, it breaks out of the loop immediately after finding the first y that increases max_sum.

Wait, the loop is:

for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):

gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)

current_sum = gcd_val + y

if current_sum > max_sum:

max_sum = current_sum

best_y = y

break

So, it starts from y=x-1 and goes down to y=1.

For each y, it calculates y + GCD(x, y), and if it's greater than the current max_sum, it updates max_sum and best_y, and then breaks out of the loop.

So, it only checks the first y that increases max_sum and then stops.

Is this correct?

Well, in the earlier examples, we saw that multiple y's can achieve the same maximum sum y + GCD(x, y)=x.

So, theoretically, any y=x - d where d is a divisor of x would achieve this sum.

So, the program starts from y=x-1 and checks y + GCD(x, y).

If y=x-1, GCD(x, y)=GCD(x, x-1), which is usually 1, unless x-1 divides x.

Wait, x-1 divides x only in specific cases, like when x=2, y=1, GCD(2,1)=1, sum=2.

But for x=3, y=2, GCD(3,2)=1, sum=3.

x=4, y=3, GCD(4,3)=1, sum=4.

x=5, y=4, GCD(5,4)=1, sum=5.

So, for prime x, y=x-1 gives sum=x.

For composite x, y=x-1 usually gives sum=x, but sometimes there are better y's.

Wait, in x=6, y=3 gives sum=6, y=4 gives GCD(6,4)=2, sum=6, y=5 gives GCD(6,5)=1, sum=6.

So, y=5 is acceptable, but y=3 and y=4 also give the same sum.

Similarly, in x=100, y=98 gives sum=100, y=99 gives sum=100, y=95 gives sum=100.

So, multiple y's achieve the sum of 100.

So, in the program, it starts from y=x-1 and goes down, and as soon as it finds a y that increases max_sum, it takes that y and breaks the loop.

Given that y=x-1 gives sum=x, which is the maximum possible, and any other y that gives sum=x is also acceptable, does it matter which one we choose?

The problem says: "find any y (1 ≤ y < x) such that GCD(x,y) + y is maximum possible. If there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are allowed to find any."

So, it's acceptable to choose any y that achieves the maximum sum.

Given that, choosing y=x-1 seems acceptable, as it achieves the sum x, which is the maximum possible.

But, in some cases, y=x-1 might not be the best choice, or there might be better y's.

Wait, in x=4, y=2 is also acceptable, since y=2 + GCD(4,2)=2 + 2=4, which is the same as y=3 + GCD(4,3)=3 +1=4.

So, both y=2 and y=3 are acceptable.

Similarly, in x=6, y=3 or y=4 or y=5 are all acceptable.

So, choosing y=x-1 is acceptable, but there might be other y's that also achieve the same sum.

But the program chooses the first y that increases max_sum and breaks the loop, which in this case is y=x-1.

So, in the example outputs:

x=10, y=5

x=7, y=6

x=21, y=18

x=100, y=98

x=2, y=1

x=1000, y=750

x=6, y=3

Wait, in x=10, y=5 is chosen, but according to the program, it should choose y=9, which is x-1=9.

But in the example, y=5 is chosen.

Wait, there might be a discrepancy here.

Looking back at the program:

for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):

gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)

current_sum = gcd_val + y

if current_sum > max_sum:

max_sum = current_sum

best_y = y

break

So, it should choose y=x-1, unless that doesn't maximize the sum.

But in x=10, y=9 gives sum=10, which is the maximum.

So, why is y=5 chosen in the example?

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the example output:

Input:

7

10

7

21

100

2

1000

6

Output:

5

6

18

98

1

750

3

But according to the program, for x=10, it should choose y=9, but in the example, y=5 is chosen.

Similarly, for x=21, y=18 is chosen, which is not x-1=20.

For x=100, y=98 is chosen, which is not x-1=99.

For x=1000, y=750 is chosen, not x-1=999.

So, the program's behavior doesn't match the example output.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back at the program:

for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):

gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)

current_sum = gcd_val + y

if current_sum > max_sum:

max_sum = current_sum

best_y = y

break

So, it starts from y=x-1 and goes down to y=1.

It sets max_sum to 0 initially and best_y to 1.

As soon as it finds a y where y + GCD(x,y) > max_sum, it updates max_sum and best_y, and breaks the loop.

So, for x=10, y=9 gives sum=10, which is greater than max_sum=0, so it sets max_sum=10 and best_y=9, then breaks the loop.

But in the example, y=5 is chosen, which also gives sum=10.

So, why is y=5 chosen in the example, when according to the program, y=9 should be chosen?

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the program.

Wait, no, looking back, the program chooses y=x-1, which for x=10 is y=9, but in the example, y=5 is chosen.

So, the program's behavior doesn't match the example output.

Is there a mistake in the program?

Wait, perhaps the program is not correctly implemented.

Wait, but according to the program, for x=10, y=9 should be chosen, but in the example, y=5 is chosen.

So, maybe the program is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum.

So, both y=9 and y=5 are acceptable for x=10.

But the program chooses y=9, which is acceptable.

So, why is y=5 chosen in the example?

Maybe the example output is just one of the possible correct answers.

So, as long as the program chooses any y that achieves the sum x, it's correct.

But according to the program, it chooses y=x-1, which achieves the sum x, so it should be correct.

But in the example, for x=1000, y=750 is chosen, which also achieves the sum x=1000.

So, y=750 is acceptable, as is y=999.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98 is chosen, which achieves the sum x=100.

So, y=98 is acceptable, as is y=99.

For x=21, y=18 is chosen, which achieves the sum x=21.

So, y=18 is acceptable, as is y=20.

For x=7, y=6 is chosen, which achieves the sum x=7.

For x=6, y=3 is chosen, which achieves the sum x=6.

For x=10, y=5 is chosen, which achieves the sum x=10.

For x=2, y=1 is chosen, which achieves the sum x=2.

So, in all cases, y is chosen such that y + GCD(x,y) = x.

So, the program, which chooses y=x-1, also achieves y + GCD(x,y)=x.

Hence, the program is correct.

But in the program, it breaks the loop as soon as it finds the first y that increases max_sum.

Given that y=x-1 gives sum=x, which is the maximum, and any y that gives sum=x is acceptable, the program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) for a given integer \( x \), such that the sum of \( y \) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is maximized.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We need to maximize \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \).
    - The sum \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \) reaches its maximum value when \( y \) is as large as possible, given that \( y < x \).

2. **Key Insight**:
    - Starting from \( y = x - 1 \) and iterating downwards, the first \( y \) that maximizes \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \) is selected.
    - Since multiple \( y \) values can achieve the same maximum sum, choosing the highest possible \( y \) (i.e., \( x - 1 \)) is sufficient in most cases.

3. **Algorithm**:
    - For each test case \( x \), iterate from \( y = x - 1 \) down to \( y = 1 \).
    - Calculate \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \) and check if it is greater than the current maximum sum.
    - If it is, update the maximum sum and record this \( y \), then break out of the loop.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = list(map(int, data[1:t+1]))
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Reading Input**:
    - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
    - Read the next \( t \) integers as the test cases.

- **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - For each \( x \), initialize `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
    - Iterate \( y \) from \( x - 1 \) down to 1.
    - Calculate \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \).
    - If this sum is greater than `max_sum`, update `max_sum` and set `best_y` to this \( y \), then break out of the loop.

- **Output**:
    - Print the selected \( y \) for each test case.

This approach ensures that we select a \( y \) which maximizes \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \), meeting the problem requirements efficiently.
