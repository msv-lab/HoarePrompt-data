Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, Bessie has a birthday cake in the shape of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n clockwise. Bessie has already chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y additional vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals that form triangular pieces of cake. The goal is to maximize the number of such triangular pieces.

In this specific version, y is always 0, which means I can't choose any additional vertices. So, I only have the vertices that Bessie has chosen, and I need to use those to cut diagonals that form triangles.

The output should be the maximum number of such triangular pieces for each test case.

Looking at the example:

Input:

3

8 4 0

1 6 2 5

8 8 0

1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8

4 2 0

1 3

Output:

2

6

2

So, for n=8, x=4, y=0 with vertices 1,6,2,5, the maximum number of triangular pieces is 2.

Similarly, for n=8, x=8, y=0 with all vertices chosen, it's 6, and for n=4, x=2, y=0 with vertices 1 and 3, it's 2.

I need to understand how to calculate this.

First, since the cake is a regular polygon, the properties of polygons and diagonals apply.

I recall that in a polygon, diagonals are non-adjacent connections between vertices. Triangular pieces would be formed by selecting sets of three vertices that form a triangle without any intersecting diagonals.

Given that y=0, I can only use the vertices chosen by Bessie, meaning I can't add any more vertices for diagonals.

I need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces by drawing diagonals between the chosen vertices.

Wait, but in the first example, with vertices 1,6,2,5 in an 8-sided polygon, how can I form 2 triangles without intersecting diagonals?

Let me try to visualize this.

Vertices: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, arranged in a circle.

Bessie chose 1,6,2,5.

If I connect 1-2-5-6, maybe there's a quadrilateral, and I can divide it into two triangles.

But I need to ensure that the diagonals don't intersect.

Hmm.

Another thought: maybe it's about choosing triples of vertices that form a triangle without any other chosen vertices inside them.

But that seems too vague.

Let me look at the code provided and see what approach it's taking.

The code reads t, the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, x, y, then reads the list of x chosen vertices.

It sorts the list of chosen vertices.

Then, it initializes ans = x - 2.

Then, it iterates from i=1 to x-1, and if arr[i-1] + 2 == arr[i], it increments ans by 1.

Then, it checks if arr[x-1] == n-1 and arr[0] == 1, or arr[x-1] == n and arr[0] == 2, and increments ans accordingly.

Finally, it prints ans.

So, the logic seems to be:

- Start with ans = x - 2.

- Check for consecutive vertices that are exactly 2 apart (like 1 and 3), and if so, increment ans.

- Check for wrap-around cases where the last chosen vertex and the first chosen vertex are also 2 apart.

Wait, but in the first example, arr = [1,2,5,6], sorted.

Wait, in the input, it's 1,6,2,5, sorted to 1,2,5,6.

Then, iterating from i=1 to 3:

- Check if arr[0] + 2 == arr[1]: 1 + 2 = 3, which is not equal to 2. So, no increment.

- arr[1] + 2 == arr[2]: 2 + 2 = 4 != 5. No increment.

- arr[2] + 2 == arr[3]: 5 + 2 = 7 != 6. No increment.

Then, check if arr[3] == n-1 (8-1=7) and arr[0] ==1: 6 !=7, so no.

Or arr[3] == n (8) and arr[0] ==2: 6 !=8, so no.

So, ans remains x - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2, which matches the first output.

In the second test case, n=8, x=8, y=0, vertices=1,3,2,5,4,6,7,8, sorted to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

ans = 8 - 2 = 6.

Then, iterating:

- arr[0]+2=1+2=3==arr[1]: yes, increment ans to 7.

- arr[1]+2=2+2=4==arr[2]: yes, increment ans to 8.

- arr[2]+2=3+2=5==arr[3]: yes, increment ans to 9.

- arr[3]+2=4+2=6==arr[4]: yes, increment ans to 10.

- arr[4]+2=5+2=7==arr[5]: yes, increment ans to 11.

- arr[5]+2=6+2=8==arr[6]: yes, increment ans to 12.

Then, check if arr[7]==n-1=7 and arr[0]==1: yes, increment ans to 13.

Check if arr[7]==n=8 and arr[0]==2: no.

But the output is 6, not 13. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back:

ans = x - 2

for i in range(1, x):

if arr[i-1] + 2 == arr[i]:

ans += 1

if arr[x-1] == n - 1 and arr[0] == 1:

ans += 1

if arr[x-1] == n and arr[0] == 2:

ans += 1

print(ans)

So, in the second test case:

arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

n=8

ans = 8 - 2 = 6

for i=1 to 7:

check if arr[i-1] + 2 == arr[i]:

1+2=3==arr[1]: no, arr[1]=2 !=3

2+2=4==arr[2]: no, arr[2]=3 !=4

3+2=5==arr[3]: no, arr[3]=4 !=5

4+2=6==arr[4]: no, arr[4]=5 !=6

5+2=7==arr[5]: no, arr[5]=6 !=7

6+2=8==arr[6]: no, arr[6]=7 !=8

7+2=9==arr[7]: 9 !=8

So, no increments in the loop.

Then, check if arr[7]==7 and arr[0]==1: arr[7]=8 !=7, so no.

Check if arr[7]==8 and arr[0]==2: arr[7]=8 and arr[0]=1 !=2, so no.

Thus, ans remains 6, which matches the output.

Wait, but in reality, if all vertices are chosen, shouldn't the number of triangular pieces be more?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

I need to think differently.

Maybe it's about the number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices as corners, with non-intersecting diagonals.

But I need to make sure that the diagonals don't intersect inside the polygon.

This seems related to triangulations of polygons.

In a convex polygon with x vertices, the number of triangles in a triangulation is x-2.

But here, the polygon has n vertices, and Bessie has chosen x of them.

So, perhaps it's about triangulating the subset of x vertices.

But in that case, if those x vertices form a convex polygon themselves, then the number of triangles would be x-2.

But in the first test case, x=4, so x-2=2, which matches the output.

In the second test case, x=8, so x-2=6, which matches the output.

In the third test case, x=2, but triangles require at least 3 vertices, so maybe it's 0, but the output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in the third test case, n=4, x=2, y=0, vertices=1,3.

According to the code, ans = 2-2=0.

Then, check if arr[i-1]+2==arr[i]:

arr=[1,3]

i=1: arr[0]+2=1+2=3==arr[1], so ans +=1 → ans=1

Then, check if arr[x-1]==n-1 and arr[0]==1: arr[1]=3==n-1=3 and arr[0]=1, so ans +=1 → ans=2

So, output is 2.

But how can 2 vertices form 2 triangles? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for choosing y=0 additional vertices, but the existing x vertices can be used to form triangles by connecting them with diagonals, and y=0 means no additional vertices can be chosen.

But in the third test case, with n=4, x=2, y=0, vertices 1 and 3, which are opposite vertices in a square.

By connecting them with a diagonal, you divide the square into two triangles.

Hence, the output is 2.

Ah, I see.

So, in this case, even with only two vertices, if they are connected by a diagonal, it divides the polygon into two triangular pieces.

Wait, but in a square, connecting vertices 1 and 3 divides it into two triangles: 1-2-3 and 3-4-1.

So, that makes sense why the output is 2.

Similarly, in the first test case, with vertices 1,6,2,5 in an octagon, perhaps connecting them in a way forms two triangles.

Wait, but I'm still not fully understanding the logic behind the code.

Let me try to think differently.

I recall that in a convex polygon with x vertices, the number of triangles in any triangulation is x-2.

But here, the polygon has n vertices, and Bessie has chosen x of them.

I need to triangulate the subset of x chosen vertices.

Wait, but in the third test case, x=2, which is less than 3, but the output is 2.

So, perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of triangles formed by adding diagonals between the chosen vertices, and the remaining parts of the polygon.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

I think the key is to consider the chosen vertices and see how they divide the polygon into regions, and count the triangular regions among them.

But I need a systematic way to calculate this.

Looking back at the code:

ans = x - 2

Then, for each pair of consecutive chosen vertices (in sorted order), if they are exactly 2 apart (meaning there is exactly one vertex between them in the polygon), then increment ans.

Also, check for wrap-around cases.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

In the third test case, x=2, arr=[1,3], n=4.

ans = 2-2=0

Then, check if arr[i-1]+2==arr[i]:

i=1: 1+2=3==arr[1], so ans=1

Then, check if arr[x-1]==n-1 and arr[0]==1: arr[1]=3==n-1=3, and arr[0]=1, so ans=2

Hence, output is 2, which matches the example.

Another way to think about it is that the number of triangles is equal to the number of "bends" or changes in direction when traversing the chosen vertices.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's counting the number of times a triangle is formed when connecting the chosen vertices in order.

But I need to confirm this with another test case.

Let me think of another test case.

Suppose n=5 (pentagon), x=3, y=0, chosen vertices=1,3,5.

SortedList: 1,3,5

ans = 3-2=1

Check if arr[i-1]+2==arr[i]:

i=1:1+2=3==arr[1], ans=2

i=2:3+2=5==arr[2], ans=3

Check if arr[x-1]==n-1=4 and arr[0]==1: arr[2]=5 !=4

Check if arr[x-1]==n=5 and arr[0]==2: arr[2]=5==5 and arr[0]=1 !=2, so no.

Hence, ans=3.

But in reality, in a pentagon with chosen vertices 1,3,5, connecting them forms one triangle in the center and three triangles around it, totaling four triangles.

But according to the code, ans=3, which doesn't match my expectation.

Wait, maybe my expectation is wrong.

Let me draw it.

Pentagon vertices: 1,2,3,4,5.

Chosen:1,3,5.

Connecting 1-3-5-1.

This forms one big triangle 1-3-5, and the regions are:

- Triangle 1-2-3

- Triangle 3-4-5

- Triangle 5-1-4

- Quadrilateral 2-3-4-5 (but this is not a triangle)

Wait, no. Actually, connecting 1-3 and 3-5 and 5-1 divides the pentagon into three triangles: 1-2-3, 3-4-5, and 1-5-4.

So, three triangles, which matches the code's output of 3.

Hence, in this case, the code seems correct.

Another test case: n=6, x=3, y=0, chosen vertices=1,3,5.

SortedList:1,3,5

ans=3-2=1

Check if arr[i-1]+2==arr[i]:

i=1:1+2=3==arr[1], ans=2

i=2:3+2=5==arr[2], ans=3

Check if arr[x-1]==n-1=5 and arr[0]==1: yes, ans=4

Check if arr[x-1]==n=6 and arr[0]==2: no.

So, ans=4.

But in reality, in a hexagon with chosen vertices 1,3,5, connecting them forms four triangles: 1-2-3, 3-4-5, 5-6-1, and 1-3-5.

Wait, but 1-3-5 is a triangle, and 1-2-3, 3-4-5, 5-6-1 are also triangles.

So, total of four triangles, which matches the code's output of 4.

Seems correct.

Another test case: n=5, x=4, y=0, chosen vertices=1,2,3,5.

SortedList:1,2,3,5

ans=4-2=2

Check if arr[i-1]+2==arr[i]:

i=1:1+2=3==arr[1]: no, arr[1]=2 !=3

i=2:2+2=4==arr[2]: no, arr[2]=3 !=4

i=3:3+2=5==arr[3]: yes, ans=3

Check if arr[x-1]==n-1=4 and arr[0]==1: arr[3]=5 !=4

Check if arr[x-1]==n=5 and arr[0]==2: arr[3]=5==5 and arr[0]=1 !=2, no.

Hence, ans=3.

But in reality, with chosen vertices 1,2,3,5 in a pentagon:

Connecting 1-2-3-5-1.

This forms two triangles: 1-2-3 and 3-5-1, and quadrilateral 3-4-5-2.

So, only two triangles, which doesn't match the code's output of 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, connecting 1-2-3-5-1, and also connecting 3-5.

This would form triangles 1-2-3, 3-4-5, and 1-5-4.

Wait, but vertex 4 is not chosen, so maybe I can't use it.

Wait, but in the problem, only the chosen vertices can be used to draw diagonals.

So, perhaps the triangles are only formed between chosen vertices.

In this case, with chosen vertices 1,2,3,5, connecting them forms triangles 1-2-3 and 1-3-5.

So, two triangles, which matches the actual count, but the code outputs 3.

Hmm, seems like the code is overcounting in this case.

Wait, perhaps the code is not correct.

Looking back at the code:

ans = x - 2

for i in range(1, x):

if arr[i-1] + 2 == arr[i]:

ans += 1

if arr[x-1] == n - 1 and arr[0] == 1:

ans += 1

if arr[x-1] == n and arr[0] == 2:

ans += 1

print(ans)

In the above test case, n=5, x=4, arr=[1,2,3,5]

ans = 4 - 2 = 2

for i=1 to 3:

i=1: arr[0]+2=1+2=3==arr[1]=2? no

i=2: arr[1]+2=2+2=4==arr[2]=3? no

i=3: arr[2]+2=3+2=5==arr[3]=5? yes, ans=3

then, check if arr[3]=5==n-1=4? no

check if arr[3]=5==n=5 and arr[0]=1==2? no

so, ans=3, but actual number of triangles is 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Perhaps the number of triangles is indeed 3 in this configuration.

Let me think again.

With chosen vertices 1,2,3,5 in a pentagon:

- Connect 1-2-3-5-1

- This forms triangle 1-2-3

- Then, triangle 1-3-5

- And, triangle 3-5-2

Wait, is 3-5-2 a valid triangle? Vertex 2 is chosen, and 3 and 5 are chosen, so yes.

So, perhaps there are three triangles: 1-2-3, 1-3-5, and 3-5-2.

Hence, the code is correct.

I must have miscounted earlier.

So, in this case, the code is correct.

Another test case: n=6, x=3, y=0, chosen vertices=1,3,5.

SortedList:1,3,5

ans=3-2=1

for i=1 to 2:

i=1: arr[0]+2=1+2=3==arr[1]=3, ans=2

i=2: arr[1]+2=3+2=5==arr[2]=5, ans=3

then, check if arr[2]=5==n-1=5 and arr[0]=1==1? yes, ans=4

check if arr[2]=5==n=6 and arr[0]=1==2? no

Hence, ans=4

But in reality, in a hexagon with chosen vertices 1,3,5, connecting them forms four triangles: 1-2-3, 3-4-5, 5-6-1, and 1-3-5.

So, the code is correct here as well.

Another test case: n=7, x=3, y=0, chosen vertices=1,3,6.

SortedList:1,3,6

ans=3-2=1

for i=1 to 2:

i=1: arr[0]+2=1+2=3==arr[1]=3, ans=2

i=2: arr[1]+2=3+2=5!=arr[2]=6, ans remains 2

then, check if arr[2]=6==n-1=6 and arr[0]=1==1, yes, ans=3

check if arr[2]=6==n=7 and arr[0]=1==2, no

Hence, ans=3

But in reality, in a heptagon with chosen vertices 1,3,6, connecting them forms three triangles: 1-2-3, 3-4-6, and 6-7-1.

So, the code seems correct.

Wait, but is 3-4-6 a triangle? Vertex 4 is not chosen, but in the problem, we can have other shapes, but only triangles are counted.

So, perhaps only triangles formed by the chosen vertices and the diagonals are counted.

Hence, the code seems to be working correctly in this case as well.

Another test case: n=5, x=5, y=0, chosen vertices=1,2,3,4,5.

SortedList:1,2,3,4,5

ans=5-2=3

for i=1 to 4:

i=1:1+2=3==2? no

i=2:2+2=4==3? no

i=3:3+2=5==4? no

i=4:4+2=6!=5? no

then, check if arr[4]=5==n-1=4? no

check if arr[4]=5==n=5 and arr[0]=1==2? no

Hence, ans=3

But in reality, with all vertices chosen in a pentagon, the number of triangles should be 3, as it's a pentagon and triangulation gives 3 triangles.

So, the code is correct here.

Wait, but in the second test case of the example, n=8, x=8, y=0, chosen vertices=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

According to the code, ans=8-2=6

for i=1 to 7:

i=1:1+2=3==2? no

i=2:2+2=4==3? no

i=3:3+2=5==4? no

i=4:4+2=6==5? no

i=5:5+2=7==6? no

i=6:6+2=8==7? no

i=7:7+2=9!=8? no

then, check if arr[7]=8==n-1=7? no

check if arr[7]=8==n=8 and arr[0]=1==2? no

Hence, ans=6, which matches the example output.

In reality, with all vertices chosen in an octagon, the number of triangles in the triangulation is 6, which matches.

So, the code seems correct in this case.

Another test case: n=4, x=3, y=0, chosen vertices=1,2,3.

SortedList:1,2,3

ans=3-2=1

for i=1 to 2:

i=1:1+2=3==2? no

i=2:2+2=4!=3? no

then, check if arr[2]=3==n-1=3 and arr[0]=1==1? yes, ans=2

Hence, output=2

In reality, with chosen vertices 1,2,3 in a square, connecting them forms two triangles: 1-2-3 and 1-3-4.

Wait, but vertex 4 is not chosen, so maybe
