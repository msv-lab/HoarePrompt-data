Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". The key here is to ensure that the program works for every potential case, and if it fails even once, it's considered incorrect.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Description

We have n containers of water lined up from left to right, each containing a certain amount of water (a_i). The sum of all a_i is divisible by n, meaning the total water can be evenly distributed among the containers. The goal is to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by performing a specific operation any number of times.

The operation allowed is to pour any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i < j. This means we can only pour water from a left container to a right container.

### Program to Verify

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program reads input using `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into tokens, and parses the first token as the number of containers `n`.
   - It then parses the remaining tokens as the list `a` representing the water in each container.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It calculates the total water and checks if it's divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. This aligns with the problem's guarantee that the sum is divisible by `n`, so this check might be redundant.
   - It computes the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - It then iterates through each container, keeping a running sum (`container`) of the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point this running sum becomes negative, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program seems to be checking if it's possible to distribute the water by only moving water from left to right.
   - The running sum (`container`) represents the excess or deficit of water up to the current container, considering the target.
   - If the running sum ever goes negative, it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to compensate for the deficit in the current container by only moving water from left to right.

4. **Correctness:**
   - The program assumes that if the running sum never goes negative, it's possible to distribute the water as required.
   - This seems correct because if the running sum is non-negative, it means that any deficit in the current container can be compensated by the excess in the previous containers by pouring water to the right.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single container: n=1. The program should return 'Yes' since there's only one container.
   - All containers already have the target amount: Should return 'Yes'.
   - Containers where the water can be redistributed by only moving water right: Should return 'Yes'.
   - Containers where moving water right isn't sufficient to balance the water: Should return 'No'.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The initial check for `total_water % n != 0` is redundant because the problem states that the sum is always divisible by n.
   - The program might have issues with large inputs due to time or space constraints, but given the constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5 and sum(a_i) ≤ 2·10^9), it should be manageable.

7. **Example Verification:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: 1 43
     - Output: 'Yes'
     - Explanation: Only one container, already meets the target.
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: 2 1 3
     - Output: 'No'
     - Explanation: To make both containers have 2 units, we need to move 1 unit from the second to the first, but the operation only allows moving from left to right, which isn't possible.
   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: 5 4 5 2 1 3
     - Output: 'Yes'
     - Explanation: The target is 3. By moving water from left to right as described in the note, it's possible to make all containers have 3 units.

Given these analyses and the examples provided, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by only moving water from left to right.

### Conclusion

After verifying the logic and testing it against the provided examples, I believe the program is correct and meets the problem's requirements for all potential cases.

**Correctness: **True**
