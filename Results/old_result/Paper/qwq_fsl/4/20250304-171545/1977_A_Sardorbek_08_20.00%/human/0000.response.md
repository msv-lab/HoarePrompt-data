Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". Partially correct programs are considered incorrect. I have to analyze the source code to see if there's any missing logic or edge cases that the code isn't handling.

I've been given three examples to understand how this works. Let's look at them one by one.

**Example 1:**

Problem Description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

Program:

```python

def is_not_prime(n):

    if n < 2:

        return True

    for i in range(2, n):

        if n % i == 0:

            return True

    return False

```

Example Answer: Correctness: **True**

So, in this case, the program is considered correct. I need to think about why this is the case. The function is supposed to identify non-prime numbers. Let's consider what a non-prime number is: it's any integer that is not a prime number, meaning it has divisors other than 1 and itself.

The function checks if n is less than 2, in which case it returns True, correctly identifying numbers less than 2 as non-prime. Then it loops from 2 to n-1, checking if n is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, it returns True, indicating a non-prime number. If no divisors are found, it returns False, indicating a prime number.

This seems logically sound. For example:

- n = 0: less than 2, return True (correct)

- n = 1: less than 2, return True (correct)

- n = 2: loops from 2 to 1 (nothing to check), return False (correct)

- n = 4: divisible by 2, return True (correct)

- n = 5: no divisors between 2 and 4, return False (correct)

I can't think of any cases where this would fail, so the correctness is True.

**Example 2:**

Problem Description: Write a Python function to count all substrings starting and ending with the same character.

Program:

```python

def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

    count = 0

    for i in range(len(s)-1):

        for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

            if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                count += 1

    return count

```

Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

Here, the program is considered incorrect. I need to think about why that might be.

The function is supposed to count all substrings where the first and last characters are the same. Let's consider an example:

Take s = "abc"

Possible substrings:

- a

- ab

- abc

- b

- bc

- c

Among these, substrings that start and end with the same character are:

- a

- b

- c

So, there should be 3 such substrings.

Now, let's see what the function does:

- i = 0:

- j = 0: check s[0] == s[1] → 'a' == 'b' → False

- j = 1: check s[0] == s[2] → 'a' == 'c' → False

- i = 1:

- j = 1: check s[1] == s[2] → 'b' == 'c' → False

- i = 2:

- No j since j ranges up to len(s)-2 which is 1, and i=2 > 1

So, count remains 0, but it should be 3. This is a clear mistake.

Another example: s = "aaa"

Possible substrings:

- a

- aa

- aaa

- a

- aa

- a

All substrings start and end with 'a', so count should be 6.

But according to the function:

- i = 0:

- j = 0: s[0] == s[1] → 'a' == 'a' → True, count=1

- j = 1: s[0] == s[2] → 'a' == 'a' → True, count=2

- i = 1:

- j = 1: s[1] == s[2] → 'a' == 'a' → True, count=3

- i = 2:

- No j

So, count=3, but it should be 6. This is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect, and the correctness is False.

**Example 3:**

Problem Description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

Program:

```python

def binary_search(arr, target):

    left = 0

    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:

        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:

            return mid

        elif arr[mid] < target:

            left = mid

        else:

            right = mid - 1

    if arr[left] == target:

        return left

    return -1

```

Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

This binary search function is marked as incorrect. Let's see why.

First, binary search requires the array to be sorted. Assuming that arr is sorted in ascending order, let's look at the implementation.

Issues I can spot:

1. When arr[mid] < target, setting left = mid might not be correct because mid could still be less than the target. Typically, we set left = mid + 1.

2. When arr[mid] > target, setting right = mid - 1 is correct.

3. The termination condition is while left < right, which is fine.

4. After the loop, it checks if arr[left] == target, which might not be correct because left could be equal to right, and we need to check that.

Let's test with an example:

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 3

- left = 0, right = 4

- mid = 2, arr[2] = 3 == target → return 2 (correct)

Another example:

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 6

- left = 0, right = 4

- mid = 2, arr[2] = 3 < 6 → left = 2

- now left = 2, right = 4

- mid = 3, arr[3] = 4 < 6 → left = 3

- now left = 3, right = 4

- mid = 3, arr[3] = 4 < 6 → left = 3

- now left = 3, right = 4

- mid = 3, arr[3] = 4 < 6 → left = 3

- this enters an infinite loop because left remains 3 and right is 4, and mid keeps being 3.

To fix this, we should have left = mid + 1 when arr[mid] < target.

Hence, this program has a flaw and is incorrect.

So, based on these examples, I need to carefully analyze the given program for the actual task to see if it meets the problem requirements for all possible cases.

Now, moving on to my actual task.

**Your Task:**

Problem Description:

The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly m cubes?

Input:

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

Output:

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.

Example:

Input:

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

Output:

Yes

No

Yes

Program:

```python

def func():

    a = int(input())

    for i in range(a):

        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())

        q = (b, c)

        if b == c:

            print('YES')

        elif b < c:

            print('NO')

        elif a % 2 == b % 2:

            print('Yes')

        else:

            print('No')

```

Alright, I need to verify if this program correctly solves the problem described.

First, I need to understand the problem:

- We have a tower starting with 0 cubes.

- In each move, Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.

- After n moves, we want to know if it's possible to have exactly m cubes in the tower.

- We need to answer t test cases, each with their own n and m.

Let's think about the possible scenarios:

1. If n < m: It's impossible to have m cubes if we have fewer moves than cubes, since each add operation only adds 1 cube.

   - Wait, no. If n > m, it's still possible if the difference (n - m) is even, because we can add and remove cubes in such a way that they cancel out.

   - For example, if n = 5 and m = 3, we can add 4 times and remove 1 time: +1, +1, +1, +1, -1, resulting in 3 cubes.

   - So, the condition is that n - m should be even, because each remove operation cancels out one add operation.

2. If n == m:

   - If n is even, we can just add n times.

   - If n is odd, we can add n times.

   - Wait, actually, if n == m, it's always possible by just adding n times.

3. If n < m:

   - This seems impossible because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves, unless we add and remove in a way that net addition is m.

   - Wait, no. If n < m, it's impossible because even if we add all n times, we only have n cubes, which is less than m.

So, summarizing:

- If n < m: Impossible.

- If n == m: Possible.

- If n > m: Possible only if (n - m) is even.

Wait, let's think again.

Actually, each move is either +1 or -1.

So, the total number of add operations (A) and remove operations (R) must satisfy:

A + R = n (total moves)

A - R = m (net addition)

Solving these two equations:

A = (n + m)/2

R = (n - m)/2

For A and R to be integers (since they represent counts of operations), (n + m) must be even, and (n - m) must be even.

Wait, actually, since A and R must be integers, (n + m) and (n - m) must both be even or both be odd, but since n and m are integers, (n + m) and (n - m) have the same parity.

So, the condition is that (n - m) must be even, and A = (n + m)/2 must be non-negative integers.

Also, A and R must be non-negative.

So, the conditions are:

1. n - m is even.

2. (n + m)/2 is an integer.

3. A = (n + m)/2 >= 0

4. R = (n - m)/2 >= 0

But since n and m are both positive integers, and n >= 1 and m >= 1, we need to ensure that A and R are integers and non-negative.

So, the main condition is that (n - m) is even and n >= m.

Now, looking back at the program:

```python

def func():

    a = int(input())

    for i in range(a):

        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())

        q = (b, c)

        if b == c:

            print('YES')

        elif b < c:

            print('NO')

        elif a % 2 == b % 2:

            print('Yes')

        else:

            print('No')

```

Let's analyze this:

- a = int(input()) # number of test cases

- For each test case:

- Read b and c (n and m)

- If b == c: print 'YES'

- Elif b < c: print 'NO'

- Elif a % 2 == b % 2: print 'Yes'

- Else: print 'No'

Wait, there's a problem here.

In the last elif condition, it's checking a % 2 == b % 2, where a is the number of test cases, not related to the current test case.

It should probably be checking if (b - c) % 2 == 0.

Also, the conditions are not correctly capturing the logic we derived earlier.

The correct conditions should be:

- If b < c: Impossible → 'No'

- Else if (b - c) % 2 == 0: Possible → 'Yes'

- Else: Impossible → 'No'

But in the code:

- If b == c: print 'YES'

- Elif b < c: print 'NO'

- Elif a % 2 == b % 2: print 'Yes'

- Else: print 'No'

This is incorrect because:

1. In the third condition, it's checking a % 2 == b % 2, which is unrelated to the current test case. It should be checking (b - c) % 2 == 0.

2. The first condition is b == c, which is correct, but it should also check if (b - c) % 2 == 0, but since b == c, (b - c) == 0, which is even, so it's correct to print 'Yes'.

3. However, in the example answer, it's printed as 'YES', but according to the problem, it's acceptable to print 'Yes' or 'No' in any case.

4. The second condition is b < c, print 'NO', which is correct.

5. The third condition is elif a % 2 == b % 2: print 'Yes'

   - This is incorrect because a is the number of test cases, which is unrelated to the current test case.

   - It should be checking if (b - c) % 2 == 0.

6. The else condition is print 'No', which would cover the case when b > c and (b - c) % 2 != 0.

So, to make this program correct, it should be:

- If b < c: 'No'

- Else if (b - c) % 2 == 0: 'Yes'

- Else: 'No'

In the given program, it's using a % 2 == b % 2, which is wrong because a is the number of test cases, not related to the current n and m.

Therefore, this program is incorrect.

But wait, let's see if this could still work correctly by some coincidence.

Consider the first example:

Input:

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

Output:

Yes

No

Yes

Now, let's see what the program does for these inputs.

First test case: b=3, c=3

- b == c: print 'YES' → correct

Second test case: b=2, c=4

- b < c: print 'NO' → correct

Third test case: b=5, c=3

- b > c, so check a % 2 == b % 2

- a = 3 (number of test cases), 3 % 2 = 1

- b = 5, 5 % 2 = 1

- So, 1 == 1, print 'Yes' → correct in this case

But does this always hold?

Let's consider another test case:

b=4, c=2

- b > c, so check a % 2 == b % 2

- a=3 % 2 =1, b=4 % 2=0

- 1 != 0, so print 'No'

But according to the correct logic:

- b - c = 4 - 2 = 2, which is even, so should print 'Yes'

So, for b=4, c=2, the program would print 'No', which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

I can provide an explanation for why it's incorrect by mentioning the test case where b=4, c=2 should print 'Yes' but the program prints 'No'.

Alternatively, I can think of another test case:

b=4, c=0

- b > c, check a % 2 == b % 2

- a=3 % 2=1, b=4 % 2=0

- 1 != 0, so print 'No'

But according to correct logic:

- b - c = 4 - 0 = 4, which is even, so should print 'Yes'

Hence, another incorrect output.

So, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \textbf{False}} \]
