Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from his original rectangle by cutting it and rearranging the pieces. The problem provides a description, some input constraints, and an example. My job is to check if the provided program correctly implements this logic.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Bob has a rectangle of size a x b. He can make one cut parallel to one of the sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles. Then, he can rearrange these two rectangles (by rotating or moving them) to form a new rectangle. The goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

The problem provides some examples:

- For a 1x1 rectangle, no cutting is possible, so the answer is "No."

- For a 2x1 rectangle, cutting results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as each other.

- For a 2x6 rectangle, cutting can result in two 2x3 rectangles, which can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

From these, it seems that the program needs to check if there's any way to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a different rectangle.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```python

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:

print('NO')

elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

```

I need to verify if this program correctly implements the logic described in the problem.

First, I'll analyze the conditions in the program:

1. If both a and b are odd, print 'NO'.

2. Else, if a is double of b or b is double of a, print 'NO'.

3. Otherwise, print 'YES'.

I need to see if these conditions correctly capture the logic of whether a new, different rectangle can be formed.

Let's consider the first condition: both a and b are odd.

- If both dimensions are odd, cutting parallel to any side will result in rectangles with at least one odd dimension.

- Since odd dimensions can't be combined to form a new rectangle that is different from the original (considering the constraints), it makes sense to return 'NO' in this case.

Next, the second condition: a is double of b or b is double of a.

- If a = 2 * b or b = 2 * a, let's see what happens.

- For example, a = 2, b = 1.

- Cutting the 2x1 rectangle: cutting parallel to the shorter side would result in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

- Similarly, for a = 4, b = 2: cutting parallel to the shorter side results in two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 2x4 or 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

- Hence, in these cases, it's not possible to form a different rectangle, so 'NO' is appropriate.

Finally, in all other cases, the program returns 'YES'.

I need to verify if in all other cases, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Let's consider some test cases:

1. a = 2, b = 6.

- As per the example, cutting into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

- Program should return 'YES', which it does.

2. a = 3, b = 2.

- Cutting into two 1.5x2 rectangles, but since dimensions must be integers, cutting parallel to the a side isn't possible.

- Cutting parallel to the b side: cutting into two 3x1 rectangles.

- These can be arranged to form a 1x6 or 6x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2.

- Wait, but according to the problem, rectangles that are rotations of each other are considered the same.

- So, 1x6 and 6x1 are considered the same, and compared to the original 3x2, which is different.

- Hence, 'YES' is correct.

3. a = 2, b = 2.

- Cutting into two 1x2 rectangles.

- Arranging them can form a 1x4 or 4x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

- So, 'YES' is correct.

4. a = 2, b = 4.

- Cutting into two 2x2 rectangles.

- Arranging them can form a 4x2 or 2x4 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x4.

- Wait, but according to the program, it should return 'YES'.

- Hold on, according to the program, if a = 2 and b = 4, a / 2 = 1, which is not equal to b, and b / 2 = 2, which is equal to a.

- So, b / 2 = a, which matches the second condition, so it should print 'NO'.

- But in the example output, it's 'YES'.

- Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

- In the example input, for 2 4, the output is 'YES', but according to the program, it should print 'NO'.

- This suggests that the program might be incorrect.

Wait a minute, in the problem's example output, for input 2 4, it's 'YES', but according to the program's logic, it should print 'NO'.

This indicates that the program is incorrect, because for a = 2, b = 4, it should be 'YES', but the program prints 'NO'.

Let me check the condition again.

The program prints 'NO' if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a.

In this case, a = 2, b = 4, b / 2 = 2 == a, so it prints 'NO'.

But according to the example, it should be 'YES'.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought that if a = 2 and b = 4, cutting into two 2x2 rectangles, which can only form a 4x2 or 2x4, which is the same as the original.

Hence, perhaps 'NO' is correct in this case.

But the example output says 'YES', so there must be something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, maybe there's another way to cut the rectangle.

Let's think differently.

If we cut the 2x4 rectangle parallel to the a side (length 2):

- Cutting into two 1x4 rectangles.

- These can be arranged to form a 1x8 or 8x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

Hence, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle, so 'YES' is correct.

But the program prints 'NO' for a = 2, b = 4.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

It seems that the program's logic is flawed.

Let me try to think of a correct approach.

First, Bob can make one cut parallel to one of the sides, resulting in two rectangles.

Then, he can arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

We need to check if this new rectangle is different from the original one, considering that rotations don't count as different.

Let's consider the possible ways to cut the rectangle:

1. Cut parallel to the a side:

- This would result in two rectangles of size (a/c) x b, where c is the position of the cut, and c < a.

- Since c must be an integer, and a/c must be integer, c must be a divisor of a.

- Wait, no, the cut can be at any integer position, not necessarily a divisor.

- But the resulting rectangles would have integer dimensions only if c is an integer.

- So, after cutting, we have two rectangles: c x b and (a - c) x b.

- Then, these two can be arranged side by side or stacked to form new rectangles.

2. Similarly, cut parallel to the b side:

- Resulting in two rectangles of size a x d and a x (b - d), where d is the cut position.

- These can be arranged similarly.

Now, to form a new rectangle that is different from the original, we need to check if there's any way to arrange these two smaller rectangles to form a rectangle with dimensions that are not equal to the original dimensions, considering rotations.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Looking back at the program, it seems to have a simple condition:

- If both a and b are odd, it's impossible to form a new rectangle.

- If a is double of b or vice versa, it's impossible.

- Otherwise, it's possible.

But as we saw, for a = 2, b = 4, which should be 'YES' according to the example, but the program outputs 'NO', it's incorrect.

Let me try to find a correct condition.

From the examples:

- 1x1: 'No'

- 2x1: 'No'

- 2x6: 'Yes'

- 3x2: 'Yes'

- 2x2: 'Yes'

- 2x4: 'Yes'

- 6x3: 'No'

I need to find a general condition that matches these outputs.

First, note that for a rectangle a x b, if a and b are both odd, it's 'No'.

If a is double of b or vice versa, it's 'No'.

Otherwise, it's 'Yes'.

But this doesn't match the example where a=2, b=4 should be 'Yes', but according to the program, it's 'No'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

I need to find a correct condition.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have a rectangle a x b.

After cutting, we have two rectangles, say p x q and r x s.

Then, we can arrange them to form a new rectangle.

The area remains the same, a*b.

The perimeter might change.

But since rotations don't matter, we only need to consider the set of possible rectangles that can be formed.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the possible ways to split the area a*b into two rectangular parts and then see if those two parts can be rearranged to form a rectangle with different dimensions from the original.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the example where a=2, b=4.

As I thought earlier, cutting parallel to a side:

- Cut parallel to a (length 2): cut at position c between 0 and 2.

- If c=1, we get two 1x4 rectangles.

- These can be arranged side by side to form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

- Hence, 'Yes'.

But according to the program, since a=2, b=4, and b/2=2=a, it prints 'NO', which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is wrong.

I need to find a correct condition.

Let me consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

If GCD(a, b) > 1, maybe it's possible.

But for a=2, b=4, GCD is 2, and it should be 'Yes'.

For a=3, b=2, GCD is 1, and it's 'Yes'.

Wait, but for a=1, b=1, GCD is 1, and it's 'No'.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps if both a and b are even, or if at least one is even, it's 'Yes', except for some cases.

But in the example, a=2, b=1 is 'No', a=2, b=6 is 'Yes'.

Wait, a=2, b=1: a is even, b is odd, 'No'.

a=2, b=2: both even, 'Yes'.

a=2, b=4: both even, 'Yes'.

a=3, b=2: one even, one odd, 'Yes'.

a=6, b=3: one even, one odd, 'No'.

Wait, this is confusing.

Let me look for another approach.

Perhaps, it's about whether a and b share any common factors besides 1.

But a=3, b=2 share no common factors, and it's 'Yes'.

a=6, b=3 share common factors, and it's 'No'.

This doesn't seem to hold.

Wait, maybe it's about whether a and b are both even, or at least one is even, and they are not in a 1:2 ratio.

Wait, in the program, it checks if both are odd, or if a is double of b or vice versa.

In the example, for a=2, b=4, which is a=2, b=4, b is double of a, so it prints 'NO', but it should be 'YES'.

Hence, the condition is incorrect.

I need to find a better condition.

Let me consider the aspect ratio.

If the original rectangle has an aspect ratio that can be divided in such a way that the new arrangement has a different aspect ratio, then 'Yes'.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the number of ways to split the rectangle and rearrange.

Suppose we have a rectangle a x b.

We can cut it into two smaller rectangles in several ways.

Then, we can arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

The new rectangle must have area a*b, and dimensions p x q, where p*q = a*b, and p != a or q != b (considering rotations).

Wait, but considering rotations, we need to consider p x q and q x p as the same.

Hence, we need to check if there exists a way to split a x b into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form p x q, where (p, q) is different from (a, b) and (b, a).

This seems complex.

Maybe I should look for a mathematical condition.

Let me consider the total area, a*b.

If we can split this area into two parts, say c*d and e*f, such that c*d + e*f = a*b, and then arrange them to form p*q = a*b, with p != a and q != b.

But this is too broad.

Let me think about the number of ways to factorize a*b.

The number of possible rectangles with area a*b is the number of pairs (p, q) such that p*q = a*b.

For each such pair, we need to check if it's possible to split a x b into two rectangles that can be rearranged into p x q.

This seems too involved.

Perhaps there's a simpler way.

Looking back at the examples:

- 1x1: 'No'

- 2x1: 'No'

- 2x6: 'Yes'

- 3x2: 'Yes'

- 2x2: 'Yes'

- 2x4: 'Yes'

- 6x3: 'No'

Looking for a pattern:

- When a and b are both even: 'Yes'

- When one is even and the other is odd: sometimes 'Yes', sometimes 'No'

- When both are odd: 'No'

Wait, in the examples:

- 2x6: both even, 'Yes'

- 3x2: one odd, one even, 'Yes'

- 6x3: one even, one odd, 'No'

- 2x1: one even, one odd, 'No'

- 2x2: both even, 'Yes'

- 2x4: one even, one even, 'Yes'

- 1x1: both odd, 'No'

From this, perhaps the condition should be:

- If both a and b are odd, 'No'

- Else, if one is even and one is odd, and a != 2*b and b != 2*a, then 'Yes'

- Else, 'Yes'

Wait, but in the example, for a=2, b=4, which is a=2, b=4, a != 2*b (2 != 8) and b != 2*a (4 != 4), wait, b == 2*a, so it should be 'No', but according to the example, it's 'Yes'.

Hence, this condition is still incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that after cutting, the two smaller rectangles must have dimensions that can be combined to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Suppose we have a rectangle a x b.

If we cut it parallel to side a, at position c (0 < c < a), we get two rectangles: c x b and (a - c) x b.

Similarly, cutting parallel to side b, at position d (0 < d < b), gives a x d and a x (b - d).

Then, to form a new rectangle, we can arrange these two smaller rectangles side by side or stacked.

For example, taking two rectangles p x q and r x s, we can arrange them to form (p + r) x q or p x (q + s), etc., provided that the dimensions match appropriately.

This seems too vague. Maybe I should look for a mathematical relationship.

Let me consider that after cutting, the two smaller rectangles must have dimensions that allow their combination to form a new rectangle with area a*b and different dimensions from the original.

Wait, but any combination will have area a*b.

So, the key is to have different dimensions.

Hence, we need to check if there exists a way to split a x b into two rectangles that can be rearranged into p x q, where p != a and q != b, considering that p and q are integer dimensions.

This is still too broad.

Let me consider that for the new rectangle to be different from the original, its dimensions must not be equal to the original dimensions or their rotation.

Hence, for a x b, the new rectangle should not be a x b or b x a.

So, we need to check if we can form any p x q such that p*q = a*b and (p, q) != (a, b) and (p, q) != (b, a).

But again, this doesn't directly help.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: a and b are both odd.

- As per the program, 'No'

- Which matches the first example.

Case 2: a is double of b or vice versa.

- As per the program, 'No'

- But in the example, for a=2, b=4, it should be 'Yes', so the program is wrong here.

Hence, perhaps the condition needs to be adjusted.

Alternative approach:

- If both a and b are odd, 'No'

- Else, if a is divisible by b or b is divisible by a, 'No'

- Else, 'Yes'

Wait, in the example, a=2, b=4: a divides b, so it should be 'No', but the example says 'Yes'.

Hence, this is still incorrect.

Wait, in the example input, for 2 4, the output is 'Yes', but according to this condition, it should be 'No'.

Hence, this is not correct.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that after cutting, the two smaller rectangles must have dimensions that allow them to be rearranged into a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Perhaps, the key is to check if a and b share any common factors other than 1, but this seems unclear.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both even, or at least one is even, and they are not in a specific ratio.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me consider that for the new rectangle to be different, the side lengths must not be proportional to the original.

But since we're dealing with integer dimensions, and the area is fixed, this is tricky.

I need to find a general condition that covers all the test cases correctly.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that the program is incorrect, as it doesn't match the example input and output for a=2, b=4.

Hence, the correctness is False.

But to be thorough, I should see if there's any other condition that can make the program correct.

Wait, perhaps the program should be:

- If both a and b are odd, 'No'

- Else, if a == 2*b or b == 2*a, 'No'

- Else, 'Yes'

But in the example, a=2, b=4 should be 'Yes', but according to this, it's 'No'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
