Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every potential case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". Partially correct programs are considered incorrect. I need to think step-by-step and try to find any edge cases or scenarios where the program might not work as expected.

First, let's understand the problem description. There are three friends playing chess games together. In each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. The scores of the three players are given as p1, p2, p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if the scores are inconsistent and can't be achieved through any valid set of games.

So, the task is to determine, based on the given scores, whether it's possible to have such a sequence of games that results in these scores, and if so, find the maximum number of draws possible.

Looking at the program provided:

```python
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
```

I need to verify if this function correctly computes the maximum number of draws for each test case or determines that the scores are invalid.

Let's break down the logic of the program.

1. **Read the number of test cases, t.**

2. **For each test case:**

   a. Read the three scores p1, p2, p3.

   b. Check if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, print -1 because the total points should always be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in total for a win or 2 points in total for a draw).

   c. If the sum is even, compute the maximum number of draws using the formula:

      \[
      \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
      \]

      And print this result.

I need to verify if this logic correctly handles all possible scenarios.

First, let's consider the condition where the sum of the scores is odd. The program correctly identifies that this is impossible because each game contributes an even number of points (either 2 for a win or 2 for a draw), so the total points should always be even. Therefore, if the sum is odd, it's impossible, and -1 is printed. This seems correct.

Now, for the case where the sum is even, the program computes the result using the given formula. I need to understand what this formula represents.

Let me try to derive the correct formula for the maximum number of draws.

Let's denote:

- Let \( d \) be the number of draws.

- Let \( w \) be the number of games with a winner.

Each draw contributes 2 points in total (1 point to each player), and each win contributes 2 points in total (2 to the winner and 0 to the loser).

So, the total number of points is \( 2d + 2w \), which is always even, matching the earlier check.

Now, to maximize the number of draws, we need to maximize \( d \), given the scores p1, p2, p3.

Let's think about the constraints:

1. The total points sum to \( 2d + 2w \), which is even.

2. The individual scores must be achievable through some combination of wins and draws.

I need to ensure that the scores can be achieved by some sequence of games, and then find the maximum possible \( d \).

Let me consider that in each draw, two players each get 1 point, and in each win, one player gets 2 points and the other gets 0.

Given that, the total points are \( 2d + 2w \), and the number of games played is \( d + w \).

But I need to make sure that the individual scores can be decomposed into the correct number of draws and wins.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me look at the formula used in the program:

\[
\text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
\]

I need to understand what \( \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) \) represents.

Let's denote p1 = v[0], p2 = v[1], p3 = v[2], with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

The term \( v[2] - v[0] - v[1} \) is p3 - p1 - p2.

Since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, p3 could be larger than p1 + p2.

But what does p3 - p1 - p2 represent?

Wait, perhaps it's related to the maximum possible points one player can have beyond what the others have.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try plugging in some values from the example to see if it works.

Looking back at the example inputs and outputs:

Input:

7

0 0 0

0 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 2

3 3 3

3 4 5

1 1 10

Output:

0

1

-1

2

-1

6

2

Let's verify the first test case:

0 0 0

- No games were played, so no draws, which matches the output 0.

Second test case:

0 1 1

- According to the note, one game was played between player 2 and 3, resulting in a draw, so 1 draw, matches the output 1.

Third test case:

1 1 1

- The note says it's impossible, so output -1.

Fourth test case:

1 1 2

- Output is 2.

Wait, is that correct? Let's see.

If p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 2.

Possible games:

- Suppose p3 plays against p1: if p3 wins, p3 gets 2, p1 gets 0.

- But p1 already has 1, which is odd, so must have some draws.

Wait, perhaps multiple games.

Let me think differently.

Total points: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is even, so that's okay.

The maximum number of draws is being calculated as (4 - max(0, 2 - 1 -1)) // 2 = (4 - 0) // 2 = 2.

So, output is 2.

Is that possible?

Let's see:

- p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1, p3=0.

- p3 and p1 draw once: p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

- p3 and p2 draw once: p1=2, p2=2, p3=2.

- Then, p3 and p2 play and p3 wins: p1=2, p2=2, p3=4.

Wait, that exceeds p3=2.

Alternatively:

- p3 and p1: p3=2, p1=1.

- p2 and p3: p3=2, p2=1.

- p1 and p2: draw, p1=2, p2=2.

Wait, that makes p1=2, p2=2, p3=2, but we wanted p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Hmm, seems like it's not possible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 with draws.

Wait, maybe fewer games.

- p3 and p1: draw, p3=1, p1=1.

- p3 and p2: draw, p3=2, p2=1.

Total points: p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

That seems to work with two draws.

So, output 2 is correct in this case.

Fifth test case:

3 3 3

Output: -1

Is that correct?

Total points: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which is odd. According to the program, it should print -1, which matches.

Wait, but 9 is odd, but in the program, it checks if the sum is odd, and if so, prints -1.

But in this case, sum is 9, which is odd, so -1 is correct.

Wait, but in the example output, it's -1, but in the note, it says "For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the third player and it ended in a draw, so the answer is 1."

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the fifth test case, p1=3, p2=3, p3=3.

Sum is 9, which is odd, so it's impossible, hence -1.

Sixth test case:

3 4 5

Sum is 12, which is even.

The program would compute result = (3+4+5 - max(0,5-3-4)) // 2 = (12 - max(0, -2)) = 12 - 0 = 12 // 2 = 6.

Output is 6.

Is that possible?

Let's see:

Total points: 12, which comes from 6 games (since each game contributes 2 points).

If all games are draws, then each draw would distribute 2 points (1 to each player).

But in this case, p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

If all games are draws, points would be equal, but here they are different.

So, some games must be wins.

Wait, but the task is to maximize the number of draws.

So, we need to maximize the number of draws while still achieving the given points.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a way to have 6 draws that result in p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, but that seems unlikely because draws increase both players' points by 1 each time.

Wait, if p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1, p3=0.

p1 and p3 draw once: p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

p2 and p3 draw once: p1=2, p2=2, p3=2.

p2 and p3 play and p2 wins: p1=2, p2=4, p3=2.

p1 and p3 play and p1 wins: p1=4, p2=4, p3=2.

p1 and p2 play and p2 wins: p1=4, p2=6, p3=2.

This doesn't match p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Alternatively:

p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1, p3=0.

p1 and p3 draw once: p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

p2 and p3 draw once: p1=2, p2=2, p3=2.

p2 and p3 play and p2 wins: p1=2, p2=4, p3=2.

p1 and p3 play and p3 wins: p1=2, p2=4, p3=4.

p1 and p2 play and p2 wins: p1=2, p2=6, p3=4.

Still not matching.

Another approach:

p1 and p2 draw twice: p1=2, p2=2, p3=0.

p1 and p3 draw once: p1=3, p2=2, p3=1.

p2 and p3 play and p3 wins once: p1=3, p2=2, p3=3.

p2 and p3 play and p3 wins again: p1=3, p2=2, p3=5.

p1 and p3 play and p3 wins: p1=3, p2=2, p3=7.

This exceeds p3=5.

Seems tricky to achieve exactly p1=3, p2=4, p3=5 with 6 draws.

Maybe the program is incorrect here.

Wait, according to the program, it outputs 6, but from my attempts, it seems difficult to achieve the scores with exactly 6 draws.

Perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Alternatively, maybe there is a way to achieve it with 6 draws that I'm missing.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that each draw contributes 1 point to two players, and each win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.

Let me denote:

- Let \( d \) be the total number of draws.

- Let \( w \) be the total number of wins.

Then, the total points are \( 2d + 2w \), which equals \( p1 + p2 + p3 \).

Also, the number of games played is \( d + w \).

Now, for individual players, their points come from the draws they participated in and the wins they had.

Let me denote for each player:

- \( d_i \): number of draws player i had.

- \( w_i \): number of wins player i had.

Then, player i's points are \( p_i = d_i + 2 w_i \).

Also, the total number of draws \( d \) is half the sum of all \( d_i \), because each draw involves two players.

Wait, more precisely, each draw involves two players, so the total number of draws \( d \) is equal to half the sum of all \( d_i \):

\( d = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^3 d_i \).

Similarly, the total number of wins \( w \) is equal to the sum of all \( w_i \):

\( w = \sum_{i=1}^3 w_i \).

And the points for each player are:

\( p_i = d_i + 2 w_i \).

Also, the total points sum is:

\( p1 + p2 + p3 = \sum_{i=1}^3 (d_i + 2 w_i) = \sum_{i=1}^3 d_i + 2 \sum_{i=1}^3 w_i = 2d + 2w \).

This checks out with the earlier equation.

Now, to maximize \( d \), the total number of draws.

Subject to the constraints:

- \( p_i = d_i + 2 w_i \) for each player i.

- \( d = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^3 d_i \).

- \( w = \sum_{i=1}^3 w_i \).

- \( d \) and \( w \) are non-negative integers.

- \( d_i \) and \( w_i \) are non-negative integers for each player.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the maximum possible draws.

In the best case, all games are draws, but that may not align with the given points.

Alternatively, to maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of draws while still achieving the given points.

Let me consider that draws affect two players at a time, increasing each by 1, while wins affect one player by +2 and the other by 0.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of draws such that the points are achieved.

This seems like a system of linear equations with constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of wins needed to achieve the points, and the rest can be draws.

Wait, that might be a better approach.

Let me try to minimize the number of wins, which would maximize the number of draws.

To minimize wins, I need to maximize draws.

But I need to ensure that the points are achievable.

Let me consider that each draw increases two players' points by 1 each, and each win increases one player's points by 2 and the other's by 0.

Given p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, I need to distribute the points accordingly.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look back at the program's formula:

\[
\text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
\]

I need to understand what \( \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1}) \) represents.

Let me denote s = v[0] + v[1] + v[2].

Then, result = (s - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2.

I need to see if this correctly computes the maximum number of draws.

Let me test it with the fourth test case: p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

s = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

max(0, 2 - 1 -1) = max(0, 0) = 0.

result = (4 - 0) // 2 = 2, which matches the output.

But earlier, I tried to see if it's possible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 with 2 draws, and it seems possible.

So, in this case, it works.

Now, let's look at the sixth test case: p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

s = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.

max(0, 5 - 3 - 4) = max(0, -2) = 0.

result = (12 - 0) // 2 = 6.

But earlier, I tried to achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5 with 6 draws, but it seems difficult.

Maybe the program is incorrect in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, and I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me see if there's a way to achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5 with a certain number of draws and wins.

Let me set up equations.

Let’s denote:

- Let \( d_{12} \) be the number of draws between player 1 and 2.

- \( d_{13} \) be the number of draws between player 1 and 3.

- \( d_{23} \) be the number of draws between player 2 and 3.

- \( w_{12}^1 \) be the number of wins player 1 has against player 2.

- \( w_{12}^2 \) be the number of wins player 2 has against player 1.

- Similarly for \( w_{13}^1 \), \( w_{13}^3 \), \( w_{23}^2 \), \( w_{23}^3 \).

Then, the points can be expressed as:

p1 = d_{12} + d_{13} + 2*(w_{12}^1 + w_{13}^1)

p2 = d_{12} + d_{23} + 2*(w_{12}^2 + w_{23}^2)

p3 = d_{13} + d_{23} + 2*(w_{13}^3 + w_{23}^3)

Our goal is to maximize the total number of draws, which is d_{12} + d_{13} + d_{23}.

Subject to the above equations and all variables being non-negative integers.

This seems like a system of linear equations with integer constraints.

This is getting too complicated for this context.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider the total number of points and the possible contributions from draws and wins.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total (1 for each player), and each win also contributes 2 points (2 for the winner and 0 for the loser).

So, the total points are always 2*(number of games), regardless of whether they are draws or wins.

Given that, the total number of games is (p1 + p2 + p3)/2.

Our goal is to maximize the number of draws, which means minimizing the number of wins.

However, we need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved with some combination of draws and wins.

The minimal number of wins occurs when as many games as possible are draws.

But, in reality, to maximize draws, we need to see how many draws can be made without exceeding the individual scores.

This is still confusing.

Let me look back at the formula in the program.

result = (s - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2

In the sixth test case, s = 12, max(0, 5 - 3 -4) = max(0, -2) = 0, so result = 6.

But is that the correct maximum number of draws?

Let me try to see.

If all 6 games are draws, then each draw gives 2 points total, so total points would be 12, which matches.

But in terms of individual scores, if all 6 games are draws, then points would be distributed equally among the players based on their participation in draws.

Wait, each draw involves two players, each getting 1 point.

So, if we have 6 draws, and distribute them among the players, we need to see if we can reach p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Let’s say:

- Player 1 participates in d1 draws.

- Player 2 participates in d2 draws.

- Player 3 participates in d3 draws.

Then, p1 = d1, p2 = d2, p3 = d3.

But wait, in reality, since each draw involves two players, the sum of d1, d2, d3 should be 2*number of draws, because each draw is counted for two players.

So, d1 + d2 + d3 = 2*d.

Given that d = 6, d1 + d2 + d3 = 12.

But we have p1 = d1 = 3, p2 = d2 = 4, p3 = d3 = 5.

So, d1 + d2 + d3 = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which matches 2*d = 12.

So, it seems possible.

But earlier, when I tried to simulate the games, I couldn't reach those points.

Maybe I was making a mistake.

Let me try again.

Suppose all 6 games are draws:

- Assign draws as needed to reach p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, player 1 draws 3 times, player 2 draws 4 times, player 3 draws 5 times.

But in this setup, each draw is between two players, so the sum should be even.

Wait, but 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which is even, so that's fine.

Now, can we pair them appropriately?

Possible pairings:

- Player 1 and Player 2 draw 2 times: p1 += 2, p2 += 2 → p1=2, p2=2.

- Player 1 and Player 3 draw 1 time: p1 +=1, p3 +=1 → p1=3, p3=1.

- Player 2 and Player 3 draw 3 times: p2 +=3, p3 +=3 → p2=5, p3=4.

But that gives p1=3, p2=5, p3=4, which is not matching p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Wait, maybe adjust the number of draws.

- Player 1 and Player 2 draw 1 time: p1=1, p2=1.

- Player 1 and Player 3 draw 2 times: p1=3, p3=2.

- Player 2 and Player 3 draw 4 times: p2=5, p3=6.

This gives p1=3, p2=5, p3=6, which is not matching.

Another attempt:

- Player 1 and Player 2 draw 0 times.

- Player 1 and Player 3 draw 3 times: p1=3, p3=3.

- Player 2 and Player 3 draw 2 times: p2=2, p3=5.

Total: p1=3, p2=2, p3=5.

Not matching p2=4.

Another attempt:

- Player 1 and Player 2 draw 1 time: p1=1, p2=1.

- Player 1 and Player 3 draw 2 times: p1=3, p3=2.

- Player 2 and Player 3 draw 3 times: p2=4, p3=5.

This gives exactly p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, with 6 draws, it's possible.

Therefore, the program's output of 6 is correct in this case.

Earlier, I was making mistakes in counting the draws.

So, perhaps the formula in the program is correct.

Let me check another test case.

Seventh test case:

1 1 10

Sum s = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12, which is even.

max(0, 10 - 1 -1) = max(0, 8) = 8.

result = (12 - 8) // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2.

Output is 2.

Is that correct?

Let's see if it's possible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10 with 2 draws.

If there are 2 draws, contributing 4 points in total, and the remaining points must come from wins.

Total points: 12.

Points from draws: 4.

Points from wins: 8, which would be from 4 wins (since each win contributes 2 points).

Now, let's see if we can achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10 with 2 draws and 4 wins.

From the draws:

- Suppose p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- p2 and p3 draw once: p2=2, p3=1.

But p2 cannot have more points than p2=1, which is already exceeded.

Wait, perhaps another pairing.

- p1 and p3 draw once: p1=1, p3=1.

- p2 and p3 draw once: p2=1, p3=2.

Now, need to reach p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

So, p3 needs 8 more points.

These must come from wins where p3 wins against p1 or p2.

Each win gives p3 2 points.

So, p3 needs 8 points from wins, which requires 4 wins for p3.

So, p3 wins 4 games, say all against p1 or p2.

But p1 and p2 already have their points from draws.

- p1 has p1=1 from one draw.

- p2 has p2=1 from one draw.

If p3 wins 4 games, say all against p1:

- p3 gains 8 points from wins: p3=1 (from draw) + 8 (from wins) = 9.

But we need p3=10.

Wait, maybe p3 wins 5 games:

- p3 gains 10 points from wins: p3=1 (from draw) + 10 (from wins) = 11, which is more than 10.

Wait, this suggests that it's not possible to reach p3=10 with only 2 draws.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps p3 has one draw and four wins:

- From one draw: +1 point.

- From four wins: +8 points.

- Total p3=9, which is less than 10.

To get p3=10, p3 needs to have five wins and one draw: +1 (draw) + 10 (wins) = 11, which exceeds 10.

Wait, but p3 cannot have half a win; wins are in whole numbers.

So, perhaps it's impossible to reach p3=10 with only 2 draws.

But according to the program, the maximum number of draws is 2.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrectly calculating the maximum draws in this case.

Wait, but in the example output, for input 1 1 10, the output is 2.

But from my reasoning, it seems impossible to reach p3=10 with only 2 draws.

Perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me try to see if there's a way to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10 with more than 2 draws.

Suppose we have 3 draws:

Then, total points from draws: 3*2 = 6.

Total points: 12.

Points from wins: 12 - 6 = 6, which would be 3 wins.

Now, distribute the draws:

- p1
