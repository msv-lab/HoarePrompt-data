Alright, I have this task here. I need to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program is correct, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partially correct programs are considered incorrect. I need to ensure that the program meets the requirements for every potential case as per the problem description.

To understand this better, let's look at the examples provided.

**Example 1:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:

  ```python

  def is_not_prime(n):

      if n < 2:

          return True

      for i in range(2, n):

          if n % i == 0:

              return True

      return False

  ```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **True**

This seems straightforward. The function checks if a number is not prime by returning True for numbers less than 2 and for numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves.

**Example 2:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with the same characters.

- Program:

  ```python

  def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

      count = 0

      for i in range(len(s)-1):

          for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

              if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                  count += 1

      return count

  ```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

I need to think about why this might be incorrect. The function iterates through the string and counts substrings where the first and last characters are the same. However, it might not be counting all possible substrings correctly, especially substrings of length 1 or certain overlapping cases.

**Example 3:**

- Problem Description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- Program:

  ```python

  def binary_search(arr, target):

      left = 0

      right = len(arr) - 1

      while left < right:

          mid = (left + right) // 2

          if arr[mid] == target:

              return mid

          elif arr[mid] < target:

              left = mid

          else:

              right = mid - 1

      if arr[left] == target:

          return left

      return -1

  ```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

This binary search implementation seems flawed. In the case where the target is not found, it might not handle the termination condition properly, potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results.

From these examples, it's clear that I need to thoroughly analyze the given program against the problem description, considering all possible edge cases and scenarios to ensure its correctness.

Now, let's move on to my actual task.

**Your task:**

- Problem Description: Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together. In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points while the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each. Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at all.

  You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p1, p2, and p3. Additionally, it is guaranteed that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 holds.

  Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If there isn't any way to obtain p1, p2, and p3 as a result of a non-negative number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

- Input:

  - Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). The description of the test cases follows.

  - The first line of each test case contains three integers p1, p2, and p3 (0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30) — the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.

- Output:

  - For each test case, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid set of games and results.

- Example:

  - Input:

    ```
    7

    0 0 0

    0 1 1

    1 1 1

    1 1 2

    3 3 3

    3 4 5

    1 1 10

    ```

  - Output:

    ```
    0

    1

    -1

    2

    -1

    6

    2

    ```

- Program:

  ```python

  def func():

      t = int(input())

      for _ in range(t):

          (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

          if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:

              print(-1)

              continue

          x = (a + b + c) // 2

          y = a + b

          print(min(x, y))

  ```

I need to determine if this program correctly solves the problem as described. If it does, I should conclude that it's correct; otherwise, I need to find a case where it fails.

First, let's understand the problem.

We have three players with scores p1, p2, p3, where p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given these scores, or determine that no valid set of games could lead to these scores.

In each game:

- If there is a winner and a loser, the winner gets 2 points, and the loser gets 0.

- If it's a draw, both players get 1 point.

We need to consider that any pair of players can play any number of games, including zero.

First, let's think about the total points distributed.

Each game contributes a total of 2 points to the total sum of points:

- If there is a winner and a loser: 2 (winner) + 0 (loser) = 2 points.

- If it's a draw: 1 (player A) + 1 (player B) = 2 points.

So, for t games, the total points should be exactly 2t.

Given the scores p1, p2, p3, the sum s = p1 + p2 + p3 should be even, since it must be equal to 2t for some integer t.

This is already checked in the program:

```python

if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:

    print(-1)

    continue

```

So, if the sum is odd, it's impossible, and we output -1.

Next, the program computes x = (a + b + c) // 2, which is the total number of games played, since each game contributes 2 points.

Then, it computes y = a + b, which is the sum of the scores of the first two players.

Finally, it prints the minimum of x and y.

I need to understand why it's taking the minimum of x and y.

Let me think about what y represents.

y = a + b is the total points of the first two players.

In the context of maximizing draws, perhaps y is being used to limit the number of draws involving the third player.

But I'm not sure about this logic.

Let me consider some examples to see if this program works correctly.

**Example 1:**

- Input: 0 0 0

- Output: 0

This makes sense. If no points are scored, no games were played, so the number of draws is 0.

**Example 2:**

- Input: 0 1 1

- Output: 1

Let's see:

Total points: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2, which is even.

Number of games: x = 2 // 2 = 1.

y = 0 + 1 = 1.

min(x, y) = 1.

Is this correct?

Possible scenario:

- Game 1: Player 2 vs Player 3, draw. So both get 1 point.

  - Scores: Player 1: 0, Player 2: 1, Player 3: 1.

This matches the input. So, one draw is possible, which matches the output.

**Example 3:**

- Input: 1 1 1

- Output: -1

According to the program:

Sum: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is odd.

So, output -1, which is correct.

**Example 4:**

- Input: 1 1 2

- Output: 2

Let's check:

Sum: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is even.

x = 4 // 2 = 2.

y = 1 + 1 = 2.

min(x, y) = 2.

Is this possible?

Possible scenario:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw. Both get 1 point.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, Player 3 wins. Player 3 gets 2 points, Player 2 gets 0.

  - Final scores: Player 1: 1, Player 2: 1, Player 3: 2.

This matches the input, and there are two draws, but wait, in this scenario, only one draw occurred.

Wait, in Game 2, it's a win for Player 3, so no draw.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a different set of games.

Alternative scenario:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 3, Player 3 wins. Player 1: 0, Player 3: 2.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, draw. Player 2: 1, Player 3: 3.

  - But this would make Player 3 have 3 points, which is not matching the input.

Wait, input is 1,1,2.

Another scenario:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw. Player 1:1, Player 2:1.

- Game 2: Player 1 vs Player 3, draw. Player 1:2, Player 3:1.

  - But this would make Player 1 have 2 points, Player 2 have 1 point, Player 3 have 1 point, which matches the input.

In this case, there are two draws.

So, it seems possible.

But according to the program, output is 2, which seems correct.

Wait, but in the note, it says output is 2 for this input.

Wait, in my earlier thought, I had a confusion about the scenarios.

So, perhaps the program is correct in this case.

**Example 5:**

- Input: 3 3 3

- Output: -1

Sum: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which is odd.

So, output -1, which is correct.

**Example 6:**

- Input: 3 4 5

- Output: 6

Sum: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which is even.

x = 12 // 2 = 6.

y = 3 + 4 = 7.

min(x, y) = 6.

Is this possible?

Let's see.

Total games: 6.

We need to distribute the points such that Player 1 has 3, Player 2 has 4, and Player 3 has 5.

Possible scenario:

- Player 1 vs Player 2:

  - Draw: both get 1 point.

- Player 1 vs Player 3:

  - Player 3 wins: Player 3 gets 2, Player 1 gets 0.

- Player 2 vs Player 3:

  - Player 2 wins: Player 2 gets 2, Player 3 gets 0.

But let's try to maximize draws.

Suppose all games are draws:

- Each draw contributes 2 points to the total.

- With 6 draws, total points: 12, which matches the sum.

- But we need to see if we can distribute the points as 3, 4, 5.

If all 6 games are draws, and points are distributed accordingly.

But how to distribute draws among the pairs to get exactly 3,4,5.

Let me try:

- Let’s say Player 1 and Player 2 draw k times.

- Player 1 and Player 3 draw m times.

- Player 2 and Player 3 draw n times.

Total draws: k + m + n.

Total points:

- Player 1: k + m

- Player 2: k + n

- Player 3: m + n

Given that:

k + m = 3

k + n = 4

m + n = 5

We can solve these equations.

From the first two equations:

k + m = 3

k + n = 4

Subtracting: n - m = 1 => n = m + 1

From m + n = 5:

m + (m + 1) = 5 => 2m + 1 = 5 => 2m = 4 => m = 2

Then, n = 3

And k + m = 3 => k + 2 = 3 => k = 1

So, k = 1, m = 2, n = 3.

Total draws: k + m + n = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which matches the output.

So, in this case, it's possible to have 6 draws, and the points add up correctly.

**Example 7:**

- Input: 1 1 10

- Output: 2

Sum: 1 + 1 + 10 = 12, which is even.

x = 12 // 2 = 6.

y = 1 + 1 = 2.

min(x, y) = 2.

Is this possible?

Wait, but the output is 2, but is that the maximum possible number of draws?

Let me think.

Total points: 12, so total games: 6.

We need to maximize the number of draws.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total.

Each win/loss contributes 2 points as well (2 for winner, 0 for loser).

But we need to maximize draws, which means as many games as possible should be draws.

However, we have to satisfy the individual scores.

Given the scores: 1, 1, 10.

Let’s see.

If we have maximum draws, let's see how many draws we can have.

Let’s denote:

- d12: number of draws between Player 1 and Player 2.

- d13: number of draws between Player 1 and Player 3.

- d23: number of draws between Player 2 and Player 3.

Then:

- Player 1 score: d12 + d13

- Player 2 score: d12 + d23

- Player 3 score: d13 + d23

Given:

d12 + d13 = 1

d12 + d23 = 1

d13 + d23 = 10

Wait, that doesn't add up.

From the first two equations:

d12 + d13 = 1

d12 + d23 = 1

Subtracting: d23 - d13 = 0 => d23 = d13

Then, d13 + d23 = 10 => d13 + d13 = 10 => 2 d13 = 10 => d13 = 5

Then d23 = 5

And d12 + d13 = 1 => d12 + 5 = 1 => d12 = -4

Which is impossible, since number of draws can't be negative.

Therefore, there is no valid set of draws and wins that can lead to scores 1,1,10.

But according to the program, it outputs 2, which is different from -1.

Wait, but in the example output, it's 2, which might be correct if there is a way to achieve it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the equations.

Wait, maybe there are wins involved as well.

Let’s denote:

- w12: number of times Player 1 beats Player 2.

- w13: number of times Player 1 beats Player 3.

- w23: number of times Player 2 beats Player 3.

- d12: number of draws between Player 1 and Player 2.

- d13: number of draws between Player 1 and Player 3.

- d23: number of draws between Player 2 and Player 3.

Then:

- Player 1 score: d12 + d13 + 2 w12 + 2 w13

- Player 2 score: d12 + d23 + 2 w23 + 2 w21

- Wait, need to define w21 as number of times Player 2 beats Player 1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to define wins in one direction only.

Let me redefine:

- wAB: number of times A beats B.

- dAB: number of draws between A and B.

Then:

- Player A's score: sum over all B where A plays B of (2 wAB + dAB)

Similarly for other players.

Given that, for Player 1: 2 w12 + 2 w13 + d12 + d13 = 1

Similarly:

Player 2: 2 w21 + 2 w23 + d12 + d23 = 1

Player 3: 2 w31 + 2 w32 + d13 + d23 = 10

This is a system of equations.

We also have that wAB and dAB are non-negative integers.

This seems complex to solve manually.

Given that the program outputs 2 for input 1 1 10, but according to the example output, it's 2.

So, perhaps there is a way to achieve this.

Wait, but intuitively, if Player 3 has 10 points, and the other two have only 1 each, it seems unlikely, but maybe it's possible with a certain distribution of wins and draws.

Perhaps I need to accept that the program is correct in this case, as the example output is 2.

So, moving on.

I need to see if there are any cases where this program fails.

Let me think about other test cases.

**Test Case 1:**

- Input: 0 0 0

- Output: 0

- Explanation: No games were played.

- Program Output: 0

- Correct.

**Test Case 2:**

- Input: 0 1 1

- Output: 1

- Explanation: One draw between Player 2 and Player 3.

- Program Output: 1

- Correct.

**Test Case 3:**

- Input: 1 1 1

- Output: -1

- Explanation: The sum is odd, which is invalid.

- Program Output: -1

- Correct.

**Test Case 4:**

- Input: 1 1 2

- Output: 2

- Explanation: Possible with one draw between Player 1 and Player 2, and one draw between Player 1 and Player 3.

- Program Output: 2

- Correct.

**Test Case 5:**

- Input: 3 3 3

- Output: -1

- Explanation: The sum is even, but it's impossible to have all players with the same score in this setup.

- Program Output: -1

- Correct.

**Test Case 6:**

- Input: 3 4 5

- Output: 6

- Explanation: As explained earlier, with k=1, m=2, n=3 draws.

- Program Output: 6

- Correct.

**Test Case 7:**

- Input: 1 1 10

- Output: 2

- Explanation: Not sure, but according to the program and example output, it's 2.

- Program Output: 2

- Correct.

Now, let's think about some additional test cases to verify the program.

**Additional Test Case 1:**

- Input: 2 2 2

- Sum: 6, which is even.

- x = 3

- y = 4

- min(x, y) = 3

Is this possible?

Let's see:

Possible scenario:

- Player 1 vs Player 2: draw (both get 1 point)

- Player 1 vs Player 3: draw (both get 1 point)

- Player 2 vs Player 3: draw (both get 1 point)

- Final scores: Player 1: 2, Player 2: 2, Player 3: 2

This matches the input, and there are 3 draws.

Alternatively, is there a way to have more draws? If we have 3 draws, which is the total number of games, it seems maximal.

So, output should be 3, which matches the program's output.

**Additional Test Case 2:**

- Input: 0 0 2

- Sum: 2, which is even.

- x = 1

- y = 0

- min(x, y) = 0

Is this possible?

Possible scenario:

- Player 2 vs Player 3: Player 3 wins (Player 3 gets 2, Player 2 gets 0)

- No draws, so draws = 0

This matches the program's output.

**Additional Test Case 3:**

- Input: 2 3 4

- Sum: 9, which is odd.

- Output: -1

- Program Output: -1

- Correct.

**Additional Test Case 4:**

- Input: 5 5 5

- Sum: 15, which is odd.

- Output: -1

- Program Output: -1

- Correct.

**Additional Test Case 5:**

- Input: 0 0 4

- Sum: 4, which is even.

- x = 2

- y = 0

- min(x, y) = 0

Possible scenario:

- Player 2 vs Player 3: Player 3 wins twice (Player 3 gets 4, Player 2 gets 0)

- No draws.

- Matches the output.

**Additional Test Case 6:**

- Input: 1 2 3

- Sum: 6, which is even.

- x = 3

- y = 3

- min(x, y) = 3

Possible scenario:

- Player 1 vs Player 2: draw (Player 1:1, Player 2:1)

- Player 1 vs Player 3: Player 3 wins (Player 1:1, Player 3:2)

- Player 2 vs Player 3: Player 3 wins (Player 2:2, Player 3:4)

- But this gives Player 3:4, which is more than 3.

Wait, incorrect.

Alternative scenario:

- Player 1 vs Player 2: Player 2 wins (Player 1:0, Player 2:2)

- Player 1 vs Player 3: draw (Player 1:1, Player 3:1)

- Player 2 vs Player 3: draw (Player 2:3, Player 3:2)

- Final scores: Player 1:1, Player 2:3, Player 3:2

This matches the input, with 2 draws.

But according to the program, it's min(x, y) = min(3, 3) = 3

But in this scenario, only 2 draws are possible.

Is there a way to have 3 draws?

- If we have 3 draws, total points would be 6 (each draw gives 2 points).

- Possible assignments:

  - Player 1 and Player 2 draw once: Player 1:1, Player 2:1

  - Player 1 and Player 3 draw once: Player 1:2, Player 3:1

  - Player 2 and Player 3 draw once: Player 2:2, Player 3:2

  - Total: Player 1:2, Player 2:2, Player 3:2

  - But the input is 1,2,3, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternative:

- Player 1 and Player 2 draw once: Player 1:1, Player 2:1

- Player 1 and Player 3 draw once: Player 1:2, Player 3:1

- Player 2 and Player 3 draw once: Player 2:2, Player 3:2

- Total: Player 1:2, Player 2:2, Player 3:2

- Doesn't match 1,2,3.

Wait, maybe another distribution.

- Player 1 and Player 2 draw once: Player 1:1, Player 2:1

- Player 1 and Player 3 draw once: Player 1:2, Player 3:1

- Player 2 and Player 3 draw once: Player 2:2, Player 3:2

- Total: Player 1:2, Player 2:2, Player 3:2

Still not matching.

Alternatively:

- Player 1 and Player 2 draw once: Player 1:1, Player 2:1

- Player 1 and Player 3 draw once: Player 1:2, Player 3:1

- Player 2 and Player 3 draw once: Player 2:2, Player 3:2

- Total: Player 1:2, Player 2:2, Player 3:2

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe it's impossible to have 3 draws and get scores 1,2,3.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case, as it outputs 3, but in reality, only 2 draws are possible.

Wait, but according to the problem, we need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

If with 3 draws, we can't achieve the required scores, then the program is incorrect.

Therefore, this seems to be a case where the program gives an incorrect answer.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for input 1 1 2, it outputs 2, which seems correct.

Wait, in my calculation for input 1 2 3, the program outputs min(x, y) = min(3, 3) = 3, but it might not be achievable.

Hence, the program might be incorrect because it doesn't check whether the proposed number of draws is actually achievable given the individual scores.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \textbf{False}} \]
