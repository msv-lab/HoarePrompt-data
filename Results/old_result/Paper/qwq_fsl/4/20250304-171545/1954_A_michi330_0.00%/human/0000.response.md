Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". Partially correct programs are considered incorrect. I have to analyze the source code to see if there's any missing logic or edge cases that the code isn't handling.

I've been given three examples to understand the task better, and then my actual task with the problem description and the program to verify.

Let's look at the examples first to get a sense of what's expected.

**Example 1:**

- Problem description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:

```python

def is_not_prime(n):

    if n < 2:

        return True

    for i in range(2, n):

        if n % i == 0:

            return True

    return False

```

- Example Answer 1: Correctness: **True**.

This seems straightforward. The function checks if a number is not prime by returning True if the number is less than 2 or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Example 2:**

- Problem description: Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with the same characters.

- Program:

```python

def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

    count = 0

    for i in range(len(s)-1):

        for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

            if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                count += 1

    return count

```

- Example Answer 2: Correctness: **False**.

I need to think about why this might be incorrect. The function seems to count substrings where the first character matches the last character. But perhaps there's an issue with the way it's iterating or counting.

**Example 3:**

- Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- Program:

```python

def binary_search(arr, target):

    left = 0

    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:

        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:

            return mid

        elif arr[mid] < target:

            left = mid

        else:

            right = mid - 1

    if arr[left] == target:

        return left

    return -1

```

- Example Answer 3: Correctness: **False**.

Again, I need to think about why this might be incorrect. Binary search requires the array to be sorted, but the problem description doesn't mention that. Also, the way the boundaries are updated might be problematic.

From these examples, I can see that I need to be thorough in checking whether the program satisfies the problem description in all possible cases.

Now, moving on to my actual task:

**Problem description:**

Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. They want to paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

**Input:**

- The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

- Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of parts, the number of colors, and the number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

**Output:**

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will all be recognized as a positive answer.

**Example:**

Input:

5

1 1 1

5 1 1

5 2 1

5 2 2

5 5 3

Output:

NO

NO

YES

NO

YES

**Note:**

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts have the same color.

**Program to verify:**

```python

import math

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for itest in range(0, t, 1):

        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:

            print('NO')

        else:

            print('Yes')

```

I need to determine if this program correctly solves the problem as described.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly.

**Problem Understanding:**

- There are n parts of the ribbon.

- Alice paints each part with one of m colors.

- Bob can repaint up to k parts to a single color of his choice.

- We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, regardless of Bob's choices.

Essentially, Alice wants to paint the ribbon in a way that even if Bob changes up to k parts, he cannot make all parts the same color.

**Approach to Verify the Program:**

1. **Understand the Program's Logic:**

   - The program reads the number of test cases t.

   - For each test case, it reads n, m, k.

   - It checks two conditions:

     a. If n <= k:

        - Print 'NO'

     b. Else if n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:

        - Print 'NO'

     c. Else:

        - Print 'Yes'

2. **Analyze the Conditions:**

   - **Condition 1: n <= k**

     - If the number of parts is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Hence, Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

   - **Condition 2: n - math.ceil(n / m) < k**

     - This seems more complex. Let's try to understand what math.ceil(n / m) represents.

     - math.ceil(n / m) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n / m.

     - n - math.ceil(n / m) represents something, but I need to interpret it in the context of the problem.

3. **Interpret the Logic:**

   - The program is saying that if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k, then it's impossible for Alice to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color (print 'NO').

   - Otherwise, it's possible (print 'Yes').

4. **Check if This Logic Aligns with the Problem:**

   - Let's consider the example cases provided.

   **Example Case 1:**

   - n=1, m=1, k=1

   - Output: NO

   - According to the program:

     - n <= k (1 <= 1), so print 'NO'

     - Correct as per the example.

   **Example Case 2:**

   - n=5, m=1, k=1

   - Output: NO

   - According to the program:

     - m=1, so math.ceil(5/1)=5

     - n - ceil(n/m) = 5 - 5 = 0 < k=1

     - So, print 'NO'

     - Correct as per the example.

   **Example Case 3:**

   - n=5, m=2, k=1

   - Output: YES

   - According to the program:

     - m=2, ceil(5/2)=3

     - n - ceil(n/m)=5-3=2 >= k=1

     - So, print 'Yes'

     - Correct as per the example.

   **Example Case 4:**

   - n=5, m=2, k=2

   - Output: NO

   - According to the program:

     - m=2, ceil(5/2)=3

     - n - ceil(n/m)=5-3=2 >= k=2 ?

     - Wait, 5 - 3 = 2 >= 2 is true, so it should print 'Yes'

     - But the example output is 'NO'

     - Hmm, this seems inconsistent.

   - Wait, perhaps I misread the condition.

   - The condition is: if n - ceil(n/m) < k, then 'NO'

   - For n=5, m=2, k=2:

     - ceil(5/2)=3

     - 5 - 3 = 2 >= 2, so it's not less than k, so print 'Yes'

     - But the example expects 'NO'

     - This is a discrepancy.

   - Therefore, the program seems incorrect for this case.

   - So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

   - But let's think deeper.

5. **Deeper Analysis:**

   - Maybe I'm misunderstanding the logic behind ceil(n/m).

   - Let's think about how Alice can paint the ribbon to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

   - Alice wants to maximize the diversity of colors in a way that even after Bob changes up to k parts, not all parts are the same.

   - One strategy is to distribute the colors as evenly as possible, making it harder for Bob to统一颜色。

   - The ceil(n/m) seems related to the minimum number of parts that will have the most frequent color.

   - In other words, if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, the maximum number of parts in any single color is ceil(n/m).

   - Therefore, to make it impossible for Bob to make all parts the same color, the difference between n and the largest group should be greater than k.

   - Wait, let's formalize this.

6. **Correct Approach:**

   - If Alice paints the ribbon such that no single color has more than ceil(n/m) parts, then the number of parts Bob needs to repaint to make all parts the same color is at least n - ceil(n/m).

   - So, if n - ceil(n/m) > k, then Bob cannot make all parts the same color, because he can only change k parts.

   - Conversely, if n - ceil(n/m) <= k, then Bob can make all parts the same color by changing at most k parts.

   - Therefore, Alice can prevent Bob if n - ceil(n/m) > k.

   - Otherwise, she cannot.

7. **Comparing with the Program:**

   - The program checks:

     - if n <= k: print 'NO'

     - elif n - ceil(n/m) < k: print 'NO'

     - else: print 'Yes'

   - According to the correct approach:

     - Alice can prevent Bob if n - ceil(n/m) > k.

     - Otherwise, not.

   - So, the program's condition seems slightly off.

   - Let's see:

     - If n - ceil(n/m) <= k, then 'NO'

     - Else, 'Yes'

   - But the program has:

     - if n <= k or n - ceil(n/m) < k: print 'NO'

     - else: print 'Yes'

   - This is almost correct, but it has an extra condition: n <= k.

   - Is this extra condition necessary?

8. **Analyzing the Extra Condition:**

   - If n <= k, Bob can change up to k parts, which may cover all parts.

   - However, in the correct approach, if n - ceil(n/m) <= k, then Bob can make all parts the same color.

   - But n <= k implies that k >= n, so Bob can change all parts, making it always possible for Bob to make all parts the same color.

   - Therefore, the extra condition is redundant because if n <= k, then n - ceil(n/m) <= k, since ceil(n/m) <= n.

   - So, n - ceil(n/m) <= k is always true when n <= k.

   - Hence, the program's condition is correct.

9. **Resolving the Discrepancy in Example Case 4:**

   - In example case 4: n=5, m=2, k=2

   - ceil(5/2)=3

   - n - ceil(n/m)=5-3=2

   - 2 <= 2, so 'NO'

   - But according to the program:

     - n - ceil(n/m)=2 < k=2? 2 < 2 is False, so it should print 'Yes'

     - Wait, but according to the correct approach, it should be 'NO'

     - So, there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

   - Wait, the program prints 'NO' if n <= k or n - ceil(n/m) < k

   - In this case, n - ceil(n/m)=2 >= k=2, so it prints 'Yes'

   - But according to the correct approach, it should be 'NO'

   - So, the program is incorrect in this case.

   - Therefore, the program is flawed.

10. **Correct Condition:**

    - Alice can prevent Bob if n - ceil(n/m) > k

    - Otherwise, not.

    - So, the program should print 'Yes' if n - ceil(n/m) > k

    - Else, 'NO'

    - But the program prints 'Yes' if n - ceil(n/m) >= k and n > k

    - Wait, no:

    - The program prints 'Yes' if n - ceil(n/m) >= k

    - Because n - ceil(n/m) < k is 'NO'

    - But according to the correct approach, it should be 'Yes' if n - ceil(n/m) > k

    - So, there's a difference in the equality case.

11. **Equality Case:**

    - If n - ceil(n/m) == k, then Bob can exactly make all parts the same color by changing k parts.

    - Therefore, Alice cannot prevent Bob in this case.

    - So, the correct condition is 'Yes' if n - ceil(n/m) > k, else 'NO'

    - The program is printing 'Yes' if n - ceil(n/m) >= k and n > k

    - Wait, no:

    - The program prints 'NO' if n <= k or n - ceil(n/m) < k

    - Else, 'Yes'

    - So, 'Yes' if n > k and n - ceil(n/m) >= k

    - But according to the correct approach, it should be 'Yes' if n - ceil(n/m) > k

    - So, in the case where n - ceil(n/m) == k, the program prints 'Yes' but should print 'NO'

    - Hence, the program is incorrect.

12. **Fixing the Program:**

    - The program should print 'Yes' only if n - ceil(n/m) > k

    - Else, 'NO'

    - So, the condition should be:

      if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:

          print('NO')

      else:

          print('Yes')

    - But currently, it's:

      if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:

          print('NO')

      else:

          print('Yes')

    - The difference is in the equality case for n - ceil(n/m) <= k

13. **Conclusion:**

    - The program is incorrect because it allows 'Yes' in cases where n - ceil(n/m) == k, which should be 'NO'

    - Therefore, the Correctness is **False**

14. **Final Answer:**

    Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program incorrectly allows for cases where n - ceil(n/m) == k to be considered as 'Yes', whereas according to the correct approach, it should be 'NO' in such cases. This discrepancy is evident in the fourth example case provided, where n=5, m=2, k=2, and the expected output is 'NO', but the program would output 'Yes' based on its current logic.

To fix the program, the condition should be adjusted to print 'Yes' only when n - ceil(n/m) > k, and 'NO' otherwise.
