Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to help Bob set up stalls with specific pricing so that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins. The program needs to output "YES" if it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and 10^18 coins such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, and "NO" otherwise. If "YES", it should also specify the number of stalls and their prices.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins. So, for each stall, she buys floor(remaining_coins / price_per_jewel) jewels and updates her remaining coins accordingly.

The program provided seems to handle this by checking if n (coins) equals k (desired jewels). If so, it sets up a single stall with price 1, which makes Alice buy n jewels, matching k since n == k.

If n < k, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than the coins she has if each jewel costs at least 1 coin. So, it prints "NO".

Otherwise, it sets up two stalls with prices [n - k + 1, 1]. It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from these two stalls and adjusts the remaining coins accordingly.

I need to verify if this approach always ensures that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Let me think about the example given in the problem:

First test case:

n = 7, k = 3

Program outputs:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to always set up either 1 or 2 stalls, but in the example, it sets up 10 stalls. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe the code is different from the example.

Looking back at the code:

def func_1(n, k):

if n == k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(1)

return

if n < k:

print('NO')

return

costs = [n - k + 1, 1]

h = 0

for i in costs:

curr = n // i

h += curr

n -= i * curr

if h < k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(*costs)

So, according to this code, it always sets up either 1 or 2 stalls, which contradicts the first example where it sets up 10 stalls. Maybe the code is incomplete or there's a different function.

Wait, in the provided program, it calls func_1(n, k), but perhaps there's another function or additional logic.

Looking back, the main part of the program is:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

func_1(n, k)

And func_1 is defined as above.

But in the problem description, the first example has multiple stalls, while the code only sets up 1 or 2 stalls. This might be a mistake in the code provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incomplete, and there's another function that handles the general case.

Wait, perhaps the function name is not func_1, or there are other functions defined elsewhere.

Looking back, the problem description mentions a video link and some text, but the actual problem is about helping Bob set up at most 60 stalls with specific pricing so that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Given that, I need to verify if the provided program correctly handles this problem.

Given the code only sets up 1 or 2 stalls, it might not cover all possible cases, especially since the example shows setting up 10 stalls.

I need to think about whether setting up only 2 stalls can cover all possible cases where n >= k.

Let me consider some examples.

Example 1:

n = 7, k = 3

According to the code:

costs = [7 - 3 + 1 = 5, 1]

So, stalls with prices 5 and 1.

Alice buys:

At stall 1: 7 // 5 = 1 jewel, remaining coins = 7 - 5*1 = 2

At stall 2: 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, remaining coins = 2 - 1*2 = 0

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

Good.

Another example:

n = 6, k = 4

costs = [6 - 4 + 1 = 3, 1]

Alice buys:

At stall 1: 6 // 3 = 2 jewels, remaining coins = 6 - 3*2 = 0

At stall 2: 0 // 1 = 0 jewels

Total jewels: 2 + 0 = 2 < 4

So, h = 2 < k = 4, so it prints "NO"

Which matches the second test case in the example.

Another example:

n = 255, k = 8

costs = [255 - 8 + 1 = 248, 1]

Alice buys:

At stall 1: 255 // 248 = 1 jewel, remaining coins = 255 - 248*1 = 7

At stall 2: 7 // 1 = 7 jewels, remaining coins = 7 - 1*7 = 0

Total jewels: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k.

But in the example, it sets up 8 stalls with prices [128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]

Which also results in Alice buying 1 jewel from each stall:

128: 255 // 128 = 1, remaining = 255 - 128 = 127

64: 127 // 64 = 1, remaining = 127 - 64 = 63

32: 63 // 32 = 1, remaining = 63 - 32 = 31

16: 31 // 16 = 1, remaining = 31 - 16 = 15

8: 15 // 8 = 1, remaining = 15 - 8 = 7

4: 7 // 4 = 1, remaining = 7 - 4 = 3

2: 3 // 2 = 1, remaining = 3 - 2 = 1

1: 1 // 1 = 1, remaining = 1 - 1 = 0

Total jewels: 8, which matches k.

So, both approaches work for this case.

But the code only sets up 2 stalls in this case, which also works.

But according to the problem, Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. So, setting up more than 2 stalls is allowed, but the code only sets up 1 or 2 stalls.

I need to check if setting up only 2 stalls is sufficient for all possible n and k where n >= k.

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n = 5, k = 2

costs = [5 - 2 + 1 = 4, 1]

Alice buys:

At stall 1: 5 // 4 = 1 jewel, remaining = 5 - 4 = 1

At stall 2: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, remaining = 1 - 1 = 0

Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k.

Another example:

n = 10, k = 4

costs = [10 - 4 + 1 = 7, 1]

Alice buys:

At stall 1: 10 // 7 = 1 jewel, remaining = 10 - 7 = 3

At stall 2: 3 // 1 = 3 jewels, remaining = 3 - 3 = 0

Total jewels: 1 + 3 = 4, which matches k.

Another example:

n = 10, k = 3

costs = [10 - 3 + 1 = 8, 1]

Alice buys:

At stall 1: 10 // 8 = 1 jewel, remaining = 10 - 8 = 2

At stall 2: 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, remaining = 2 - 2 = 0

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

Seems to work.

Wait, but in the second test case in the example, n=6, k=4, and according to the code, it would set up stalls with prices [3,1], and Alice would buy 2 jewels, which is less than k=4, so it prints "NO", which matches the second test case.

So, in cases where setting up 2 stalls doesn't allow Alice to buy exactly k jewels, it correctly identifies it as "NO".

But is there any case where setting up more than 2 stalls is necessary to reach exactly k jewels, and the code fails to recognize it because it only sets up 2 stalls?

Let me think about n=10, k=3 again. The code sets up stalls with [8,1], Alice buys 1 + 2 = 3 jewels, which matches k.

But could there be a case where with 2 stalls, h >= k, but actually, it's impossible to get exactly k jewels?

Wait, in the code, it checks if h < k, then "NO", else "YES". But h is the total jewels bought, so if h == k, it's fine, if h > k, it's still "YES", but according to the problem, we need exactly k jewels.

Wait, hold on, the problem requires exactly k jewels, not at least k.

So, if h > k, it's not acceptable, but the code still prints "YES" as long as h >= k.

This is a mistake.

For example:

n=10, k=3

Set up [8,1]

Alice buys 1 + 2 = 3 jewels, which is correct.

But what if n=10, k=4

Set up [10-4+1=7,1]

Alice buys 1 + 3 = 4 jewels, which is correct.

But what if n=10, k=5

Set up [10-5+1=6,1]

Alice buys 1 + 3 = 4 jewels, which is less than 5, so h=4 < 5, so it prints "NO"

But is there a way to set up more stalls to get exactly 5 jewels?

For n=10, k=5:

Set up stalls with prices [2,1]

Alice buys 5 + 5 = 10 jewels, which is more than 5.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, [3,1]

Alice buys 3 + 3 = 6 jewels, still more than 5.

[4,1]

Alice buys 2 + 3 = 5 jewels, which is exactly 5.

So, in this case, setting up two stalls with prices [4,1] allows Alice to buy exactly 5 jewels.

But according to the code, it would set up [6,1], where Alice buys 1 + 3 = 4 < 5, so it prints "NO", which is incorrect because there exists a setup with two stalls that allows exactly 5 jewels.

Wait, but in this case, with [4,1], Alice buys 2 + 3 = 5 jewels.

So, the code fails to find this setup because it only checks the specific prices [n - k +1, 1], which in this case is [6,1], leading to 1 + 3 = 4 < 5.

So, in this case, the code incorrectly prints "NO", even though there exists a setup with two stalls that allows exactly 5 jewels.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to ensure that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins by setting up at most 60 stalls with appropriate pricing. The initial approach in the provided program is to handle this by setting up either one or two stalls based on the values of n and k. However, this approach is insufficient for all cases, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Approach

1. **Initial Check**:
    - If n equals k, set up a single stall with price 1, so Alice buys n jewels.
    - If n is less than k, it's impossible since each jewel costs at least 1 coin.

2. **Two Stall Strategy**:
    - Set up two stalls with prices [n - k + 1, 1].
    - Calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy from these stalls.
    - If the total jewels bought equal k, output "YES" with these stall prices.
    - If the total jewels bought are less than k, output "NO".

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    # Set up two stalls with prices [n - k + 1, 1]
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    remaining_coins = n
    for p in costs:
        if p <= remaining_coins:
            curr = remaining_coins // p
            h += curr
            remaining_coins -= p * curr
        if h >= k:
            break
    if h == k:
        print('YES')
        print(len(costs))
        print(' '.join(map(str, costs)))
    else:
        print('NO')

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Explanation

- **Single Stall Case**: When n equals k, setting up a stall with price 1 allows Alice to buy exactly n (hence k) jewels.
- **Two Stall Strategy**: By setting up stalls with prices [n - k + 1, 1], we aim to make Alice buy exactly k jewels. The first stall is priced such that she buys as few jewels as possible from it,预留剩余的 coins to buy the remaining jewels from the second stall.
- **Insufficiency of Two Stalls**: There are cases where two stalls may not be sufficient to achieve exactly k jewels, necessitating a more flexible approach, such as setting up more stalls. Hence, the current implementation is incomplete and may incorrectly output "NO" in some scenarios where a solution exists with more than two stalls.

### Correctness

The provided program is incorrect because it only considers setting up one or two stalls, whereas the problem allows for up to 60 stalls. There are cases where two stalls are not sufficient to make Alice buy exactly k jewels, but additional stalls could achieve this. Therefore, the program may incorrectly report "NO" in such cases.

**Final Verdict:** Correctness: **False**
