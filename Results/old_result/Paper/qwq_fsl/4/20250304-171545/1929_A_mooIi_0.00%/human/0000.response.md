Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I have to be thorough and consider all possible cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, let's understand the problem description. Sasha wants to give his girlfriend an array of numbers, and she evaluates the "beauty" of the array based on the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. My task is to help Sasha rearrange the array in such a way that this beauty is maximized.

So, the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, starting from the second element to the last. The goal is to rearrange the array to maximize this sum.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

5

3

2 1 3

3

69 69 69

5

100 54 80 43 90

4

3 4 3 3

2

2 1

Output:

2

0

57

1

1

In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2,1,3]. After rearranging to [1,2,3], the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

In the second test case, n=3 and the array is [69,69,69]. No matter how you arrange them, all differences will be zero, so beauty is 0.

In the third test case, n=5 and the array is [100,54,80,43,90]. After rearranging, the maximum beauty is 57.

My task is to verify if the provided program correctly achieves this goal for any given input that satisfies the constraints.

Now, let's look at the provided program:

```

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))

print(' '.join(ar))

```

Hmm, this program seems to read the input, sort each array in ascending order, and print the sorted array. But is this what we need to maximize the beauty as defined?

Wait a minute, according to the problem, we need to rearrange the array to maximize the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n. Let's think about how to achieve that.

Suppose we have an array sorted in ascending order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Then, the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n would be (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

Wait, that's interesting. The sum collapses to just an - a1, because all intermediate terms cancel out.

So, regardless of how you arrange the array, as long as it's sorted in ascending order, the sum of differences between consecutive elements is simply the difference between the last and the first element.

But, is this the maximum possible beauty?

Wait, maybe I can arrange the array in a different order to get a larger sum.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case: [2,1,3]

If I arrange it as [1,2,3], sum is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

If I arrange it as [1,3,2], sum is (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 + (-1) = 1.

If I arrange it as [2,1,3], sum is (1-2) + (3-1) = (-1) + 2 = 1.

If I arrange it as [2,3,1], sum is (3-2) + (1-3) = 1 + (-2) = -1.

If I arrange it as [3,1,2], sum is (1-3) + (2-1) = (-2) + 1 = -1.

If I arrange it as [3,2,1], sum is (2-3) + (1-2) = (-1) + (-1) = -2.

So, the maximum sum is 2, which is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order.

Wait, but according to my earlier realization, the sum is always an - a1, regardless of the arrangement, as long as it's sorted in ascending order.

But in the above example, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum sum.

Let me check another example.

Take the third test case: [100,54,80,43,90]

If sorted in ascending order: [43,54,80,90,100]

Sum is (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

If I arrange it differently, say [43,100,54,80,90]

Sum would be (100-43) + (54-100) + (80-54) + (90-80) = 57 + (-46) + 26 + 10 = 57 -46 +26 +10 = 47.

Which is less than 57.

Another arrangement: [100,43,54,80,90]

Sum: (43-100) + (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) = (-57) + 11 + 26 + 10 = (-57) + 47 = -10.

Which is worse.

So, it seems that arranging the array in ascending order maximizes the sum.

But according to my earlier realization, the sum should be an - a1, which is 100 - 43 = 57, which matches.

Wait, but is this always the case?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose the array is [1,2,3,4,5].

Sorted ascending: [1,2,3,4,5], sum = (2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) + (5-4) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, which is 5 - 1 = 4.

Wait, 5 - 1 = 4? Actually, 5 - 1 = 4, yes.

Another example: [10, 20, 30], sum is (20-10) + (30-20) = 10 + 10 = 20, which is 30 - 10 = 20.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but is there any arrangement where the sum could be larger than an - a1?

Let me try.

Take [1,3,2], sum in ascending order is 2, in other arrangements, it's less or negative.

Seems not.

Hence, it appears that sorting the array in ascending order and calculating the sum as an - a1 gives the maximum beauty.

Therefore, the provided program, which sorts the array in ascending order and prints it, seems to be correct.

But wait, the problem asks to output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained, not the rearranged array.

Looking back at the program:

```

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))

print(' '.join(ar))

```

This program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the array, sorts it in ascending order, and prints the sorted array.

But according to the problem, we need to output a single integer for each test case — the maximum beauty, which is an - a1.

So, the provided program is printing the sorted array instead of the calculated beauty.

That means the program is incorrect because it doesn't follow the problem description to output the maximum beauty.

Wait, but in the examples provided earlier, when I ran this program, it seemed to produce the correct output.

Wait, no, in Example Answer 1, it says Correctness: **True**, but according to my analysis, it should be **False** because it's printing the sorted array, not the beauty.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the task.

Looking back at the examples:

In Example 1, the program is for identifying non-prime numbers, which is different from this task.

Similarly, Example 2 and Example 3 are about different problems.

So, I need to focus on the task given after "Your task:".

Given that, I need to verify the correctness of the provided program for the specific problem of maximizing the beauty of the array as defined.

According to the problem, the expected output is a single integer for each test case — the maximum beauty.

But the provided program prints the sorted array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it doesn't produce the required output.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the maximum beauty is an - a1, which is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order.

But even so, the program should output the calculated beauty, not the sorted array.

Hence, it's incorrect.

But in the first example, when I manually calculated, the sum was 2, which matches the expected output.

But according to the program, it would print the sorted array, not the sum.

Wait, maybe there's confusion.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array a that can be obtained."

But the program prints the sorted array.

Hence, it's incorrect.

But in the first example, if I input:

3

2 1 3

After sorting, it would print "1 2 3", but the expected output is "2".

Hence, it's incorrect.

Similarly, in the second test case, it would print "69 69 69", but the expected output is "0".

Hence, incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect because it doesn't produce the required output as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**.

But wait, perhaps I need to consider that after sorting, the beauty is calculated as an - a1, which is what the program indirectly achieves by sorting.

But it doesn't explicitly calculate and print the beauty; it just prints the sorted array.

Hence, it's still incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the program is just a part of the solution, and the beauty is calculated elsewhere.

But based on the given program, it's incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the beauty of an array as defined by the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty of an array is calculated as \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).
   - This simplifies to \(a_n - a_1\) because intermediate terms cancel out.

2. **Optimal Arrangement**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize \(a_n - a_1\).
   - This is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and taking the difference between the last and the first elements.

3. **Solution Code**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the length of the array \(n\).
     - Read the array elements.
     - Sort the array.
     - Calculate the beauty as the difference between the last and the first elements.
     - Print the result.

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        ar = list(map(int, data[idx].split()))
        idx += 1
        ar_sorted = sorted(ar)
        beauty = ar_sorted[-1] - ar_sorted[0]
        print(beauty)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read all input data at once and split it into lines.
   - The first line gives the number of test cases \(t\).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, read the length of the array \(n\).
   - Read the array elements and convert them to integers.
   - Sort the array to arrange elements in ascending order.

3. **Calculating Beauty**:
   - The beauty is calculated as the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array (\(a_n - a_1\)).

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the calculated beauty for each test case.

This approach ensures that we maximize the beauty of the array by correctly rearranging the elements and computing the required sum efficiently.
