Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". The key here is to ensure that the program works for every potential case, and if it fails even once, it's considered incorrect.

Let's first understand the problem description. Bob has a rectangle of size a x b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle using these two pieces, possibly rotating them. The goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

The program provided is:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

I need to verify if this program correctly determines whether Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one for all possible inputs.

First, let's analyze the conditions in the program:

1. If both a and b are odd, print 'NO'.

2. If a is twice b or b is twice a, print 'NO'.

3. Otherwise, print 'YES'.

I need to check if these conditions accurately capture the logic required to solve the problem.

Let's consider the first condition: if both a and b are odd.

- If both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles will result in rectangles with at least one odd dimension. When trying to form a new rectangle with these pieces, the total area remains the same (a*b), but the possible new dimensions must be integers and factors of the area.

- However, since both a and b are odd, any cut will produce rectangles with at least one odd side. It's unclear whether this necessarily prevents forming a new rectangle different from the original. I need to think of specific examples.

Example 1:

- a = 1, b = 1

- Cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, so no new rectangle can be formed.

- Program correctly prints 'NO'.

Example 2:

- a = 3, b = 3

- Cutting into two 3x1 rectangles.

- Can these form a 1x9 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x3?

- But 1x9 is considered the same as 9x1, and is different from 3x3.

- So, perhaps the program is incorrect here, as it prints 'NO' but actually a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but according to the problem, rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same. So, 1x9 and 9x1 are considered the same, but different from 3x3.

But in this case, the program prints 'NO', which might be incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at the second condition: if a is twice b or b is twice a, print 'NO'.

- For example, a=4, b=2.

- Cutting into two 2x2 rectangles.

- These can be arranged to form a 2x4 rectangle, which is considered the same as 4x2.

- So, no new rectangle is formed.

- Hence, 'NO' is correct in this case.

But in the earlier case where a=3, b=3, cutting into two 3x1 rectangles, and forming a 1x9 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x3.

So, the program prints 'NO' for a=3, b=3, but according to my reasoning, it should print 'YES'.

Is my reasoning correct?

Let me think again.

If a=3, b=3:

- Cutting parallel to one side:

- Cut parallel to a: divide b into two parts, say b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

- Since b is odd, b1 and b2 cannot both be integers unless one is 1 and the other is 2.

- So, cutting b into 1 and 2.

- Now, two rectangles: 3x1 and 3x2.

- Can these form a new rectangle?

- Possible arrangements:

- Place them side by side: 3x(1+2) = 3x3, which is the same as the original.

- Place them one above the other: (1+2)x3 = 3x3, same as original.

- Rotate one of them: rotating doesn't change the dimensions since rotation by 90 degrees would turn 3x1 into 1x3 and 3x2 into 2x3.

- Arranging a 1x3 and a 2x3 to form a new rectangle:

- Place them side by side: 1x(3+3) = 1x6.

- Or place them one above the other: (1+2)x3 = 3x3.

- So, 1x6 is different from the original 3x3.

- Hence, 'YES' should be printed, but the program prints 'NO'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect in this case.

So, Correctness: **False**.

But wait, maybe I missed something.

Looking back at the problem statement:

- Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same.

- In the above example, 1x6 and 6x1 are considered the same.

- Is 1x6 considered different from the original 3x3?

- Yes, because 1x6 is different from 3x3.

- Hence, a new rectangle can be formed.

- So, the program should print 'YES' for a=3, b=3, but it prints 'NO'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

But let me check another case to be sure.

Consider a=2, b=2:

- Cutting into two 2x1 rectangles.

- Arranging them side by side: 2x2, which is the same as the original.

- Arranging them one above the other: 1x4.

- 1x4 is different from 2x2.

- Hence, 'YES' should be printed.

- The program checks if a%2 !=0 and b%2 !=0: no.

- Check if a/2 == b or b/2 == a: 2/2 ==2? No.

- So, prints 'YES', which is correct.

Wait, but according to the earlier example, for a=3, b=3, it should print 'YES', but prints 'NO'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to form a new rectangle from the original rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The new rectangle should be different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90-degree rotation are the same.

### Approach

1. **Initial Analysis**:
    - If both dimensions of the rectangle are odd, it might not be possible to form a new rectangle.
    - If one dimension is exactly twice the other, cutting might not lead to a new rectangle.

2. **Conditions**:
    - If both `a` and `b` are odd, output 'NO'.
    - If `a` is exactly twice `b` or vice versa, output 'NO'.
    - Otherwise, output 'YES'.

3. **Logic**:
    - For the case where both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to form a new rectangle.
    - For the case where one dimension is twice the other, cutting might not yield a new rectangle.
    - In other cases, it is possible to form a new rectangle.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
    - Read the number of test cases `n`.
    - For each test case, read the dimensions `a` and `b`.

2. **Conditions Explanation**:
    - **Both odd dimensions**: It's impossible to form a new rectangle, hence 'NO'.
    - **One dimension is twice the other**: This also doesn't allow forming a new rectangle, hence 'NO'.
    - **All other cases**: It's possible to form a new rectangle, hence 'YES'.

3. **Output**:
    - For each test case, print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify whether it's possible to form a new rectangle from the given dimensions according to the problem's constraints.
