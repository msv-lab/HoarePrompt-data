Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements for every possible input case. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I have to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Description

Nikita has some cubes and wants to build a tower using them. Initially, there are no cubes in the tower. In each move, Nikita can either add one cube to the top of the tower or remove one cube from the top. The question is, after a given number of moves `n`, can the tower have exactly `m` cubes? The task is to determine for multiple test cases whether it's possible to achieve `m` cubes in `n` moves.

### Input

- The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

### Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, otherwise "No".

### Provided Program

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Analysis

I need to verify if this program correctly determines whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves for all possible values of `n` and `m` within the given constraints.

First, let's understand the logic behind building the tower:

1. **Adding a cube**: Increases the tower height by 1.
2. **Removing a cube**: Decreases the tower height by 1, but cannot remove more cubes than are present.

The key points to consider:

- The tower starts with 0 cubes.
- Each move is either adding or removing one cube.
- We need to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's think about the possible scenarios:

1. **If n == m**: This means Nikita only adds cubes in all `n` moves, resulting in `m` cubes. This seems correct.

2. **If n < m**: It's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves because you can't add more cubes than the moves available. So, in this case, it should be "No".

3. **If n > m**: This is more interesting. Nikita can add and remove cubes in a way that the final count is `m`. We need to see if it's possible to reach `m` after `n` moves.

Let's consider an example:

- **Test Case 1**: n=3, m=3

  - Add, Add, Add → 3 cubes

  - Possible, so "Yes"

- **Test Case 2**: n=2, m=4

  - It's impossible to have 4 cubes with only 2 moves.

  - So, "No"

- **Test Case 3**: n=5, m=3

  - One possible sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove, Add → 3 cubes

  - Another sequence: Add, Add, Add, Add, Remove → 3 cubes

  - So, "Yes"

Now, looking back at the provided program:

```python
if b == c:
    print('YES')
elif b < c:
    print('NO')
elif b % 2 == c % 2:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

Let's see if this logic holds:

1. **b == c**: Correctly outputs "YES" because adding in all moves gives exactly `m` cubes.

2. **b < c**: Correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.

3. **b > c and b % 2 == c % 2**: Outputs "Yes"

4. **b > c and b % 2 != c % 2**: Outputs "No"

I need to verify if the condition `b > c and b % 2 == c % 2` correctly determines the possibility of having `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's think about the parity (evenness or oddness) of `n` and `m`:

- Each add operation increases the cube count by 1.

- Each remove operation decreases the cube count by 1, but only if there is at least one cube to remove.

So, the net effect is determined by the number of add and remove operations.

Let’s denote:

- Let `add` be the number of add operations.

- Let `remove` be the number of remove operations.

Given that `add + remove = n` and `m = add - remove`.

We need to find non-negative integers `add` and `remove` such that:

1. `add + remove = n`

2. `m = add - remove`

From these equations:

- `add = (m + n) / 2`

- `remove = (n - m) / 2`

For `add` and `remove` to be integers, `(m + n)` must be even, and `(n - m)` must be even.

Additionally, `add` and `remove` must be non-negative.

So, the conditions are:

- `(m + n) % 2 == 0`

- `(n - m) % 2 == 0`

- `(m + n) / 2 >= 0`

- `(n - m) / 2 >= 0`

Given that `n` and `m` are both positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), we can simplify:

- Since `n >= m` (because `n >= (m + n)/2` and `n >= (n - m)/2`), we only need to check if `(m + n)` and `(n - m)` are even.

But wait, `(m + n)` and `(n - m)` being even is equivalent to `m` and `n` having the same parity (both even or both odd).

So, the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` seems relevant here.

Wait, but in the program, it's `b > c and b % 2 == c % 2`: outputs "Yes"

But according to the derivation, we need to check if `(m + n)` and `(n - m)` are even, which is equivalent to `m` and `n` having the same parity.

However, in the program, it's checking `b > c and b % 2 == c % 2`.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I derived that `add = (m + n)/2` and `remove = (n - m)/2`, and for these to be integers, `m + n` and `n - m` must be even, which means `m` and `n` must have the same parity.

So, the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is correct for `b > c`.

But in the program, it's `b > c and b % 2 == c % 2`: outputs "Yes"

And `b > c and b % 2 != c % 2`: outputs "No"

This seems aligned with the derivation.

But let's verify with some examples:

- **Test Case 4**: n=4, m=2

  - 4 and 2 are both even.

  - add = (2 + 4)/2 = 3

  - remove = (4 - 2)/2 = 1

  - Sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove → 3 - 1 = 2

  - Possible, so "Yes"

- **Test Case 5**: n=4, m=3

  - 4 and 3 have different parity.

  - add = (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5 (not integer)

  - remove = (4 - 3)/2 = 0.5 (not integer)

  - Not possible, so "No"

- **Test Case 6**: n=5, m=1

  - 5 and 1 are both odd.

  - add = (1 + 5)/2 = 3

  - remove = (5 - 1)/2 = 2

  - Sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove, Remove → 3 - 2 = 1

  - Possible, so "Yes"

- **Test Case 7**: n=5, m=2

  - 5 and 2 have different parity.

  - add = (2 + 5)/2 = 3.5

  - remove = (5 - 2)/2 = 1.5

  - Not possible, so "No"

So, the program's logic seems correct based on these examples.

But wait, in the problem description, it's mentioned that for n=5, m=3, the output is "Yes", but according to my earlier derivation, for n=5 and m=3:

- 5 and 3 are both odd.

- add = (3 + 5)/2 = 4

- remove = (5 - 3)/2 = 1

- Sequence: Add 4 times, Remove 1 time → 4 - 1 = 3

- Possible, so "Yes"

This matches the program's output.

Another consideration: Can we have negative cubes? No, because m >=1 as per constraints.

Also, m can be zero? No, m >=1.

Wait, in the problem statement, m >=1, but in the example, m=0 is not present, but according to constraints, m >=1.

So, no need to consider m=0.

Also, n can be greater than m, equal to m, or less than m, but as we saw, if n < m, it's impossible.

So, the program seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's think about more edge cases:

- **Test Case 8**: n=1, m=1

  - Add in the only move → "Yes"

- **Test Case 9**: n=1, m=0

  - Not possible since m >=1, but for completeness, removing from an empty tower is invalid.

- **Test Case 10**: n=2, m=0

  - Add, Remove → 0 cubes

  - But m >=1, so not considered.

- **Test Case 11**: n=3, m=1

  - Add, Add, Remove → 2 -1 =1

  - Or Add, Remove, Add → 1 -1 +1=1

  - Possible, so "Yes"

- **Test Case 12**: n=6, m=2

  - 6 and 2 are both even.

  - add = (2 + 6)/2 =4

  - remove = (6 - 2)/2 =2

  - Sequence: Add 4, Remove 2 → 4-2=2

  - Possible, so "Yes"

- **Test Case 13**: n=6, m=3

  - 6 and 3 have different parity.

  - Not possible, so "No"

All these test cases seem to align with the program's logic.

Moreover, the program handles the output in a case-insensitive manner, as specified in the problem ("yEs", "yes", "Yes", "YES" are all acceptable).

However, in the program, it prints 'YES', 'Yes', 'No', 'NO'. But since the problem allows any case, this should be acceptable.

Also, in the first test case, it prints 'YES', which matches the sample output.

Inconsistent casing in output might be acceptable as per the problem, but to be perfect, it's better to have uniform casing, but it's not a correctness issue.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases within the given constraints.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correctness: }\mathbf{True}}\]
