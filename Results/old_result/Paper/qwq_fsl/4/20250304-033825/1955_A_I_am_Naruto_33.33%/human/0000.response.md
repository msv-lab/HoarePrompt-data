Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum cost for buying exactly n yogurts, given the regular price per yogurt and a promotional price for two yogurts. The problem provides a series of test cases, and I need to ensure that the program handles all possible scenarios correctly.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Maxim wants to buy exactly n yogurts. Each yogurt normally costs a burles, but there's a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles. My task is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy exactly n yogurts, choosing between buying single yogurts at price a or pairs at price b.

The program provided is a function that processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads n, a, and b, and computes the minimum cost based on these values.

Let's look at the program step by step.

1. The function iterates over t test cases, where t is read from input.

2. For each test case, it reads n, a, and b.

3. If n is greater than 1:

a. It calculates ans1 as a * n, which is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.

b. It calculates ans2 as b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2), which is the cost if as many pairs as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.

c. It prints the minimum of ans1 and ans2.

4. If n is 1, it simply prints a, as there's no promotion for a single yogurt.

I need to verify if this logic is correct for all possible values of n, a, and b within the given constraints.

Let's consider some examples to test the program.

Example from the problem:

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Output:

9

14

15

20

Let's verify these:

1. n=2, a=5, b=9

- ans1 = 5*2 = 10

- ans2 = 9*1 + 5*0 = 9

- min(10,9) = 9

Correct.

2. n=3, a=5, b=9

- ans1 = 5*3 = 15

- ans2 = 9*1 + 5*1 = 14

- min(15,14) = 14

Correct.

3. n=3, a=5, b=11

- ans1 = 5*3 = 15

- ans2 = 11*1 + 5*1 = 16

- min(15,16) = 15

Correct.

4. n=4, a=5, b=11

- ans1 = 5*4 = 20

- ans2 = 11*2 + 5*0 = 22

- min(20,22) = 20

Correct.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Case 1: n=1, a=10, b=15

- Expected output: 10

- Program output: 10

Correct.

Case 2: n=2, a=10, b=15

- ans1 = 20

- ans2 = 15

- min(20,15) = 15

Correct.

Case 3: n=2, a=10, b=19

- ans1 = 20

- ans2 = 19

- min(20,19) = 19

Correct.

Case 4: n=0, a=5, b=9

- According to the problem, n >=1, so no need to handle n=0.

Case 5: n=5, a=5, b=9

- ans1 = 25

- ans2 = 9*2 + 5*1 = 23

- min(25,23) = 23

Correct.

Case 6: n=5, a=5, b=10

- ans1 = 25

- ans2 = 10*2 + 5*1 = 25

- min(25,25) = 25

Correct.

Case 7: n=5, a=5, b=8

- ans1 = 25

- ans2 = 8*2 + 5*1 = 21

- min(25,21) = 21

Correct.

Case 8: n=4, a=3, b=5

- ans1 = 12

- ans2 = 5*2 + 3*0 = 10

- min(12,10) = 10

Correct.

Case 9: n=3, a=4, b=6

- ans1 = 12

- ans2 = 6*1 + 4*1 = 10

- min(12,10) = 10

Correct.

Case 10: n=6, a=2, b=3

- ans1 = 12

- ans2 = 3*3 + 2*0 = 9

- min(12,9) = 9

Correct.

Case 11: n=7, a=2, b=3

- ans1 = 14

- ans2 = 3*3 + 2*1 = 11

- min(14,11) = 11

Correct.

Case 12: n=100, a=1, b=2

- ans1 = 100

- ans2 = 2*50 + 1*0 = 100

- min(100,100) = 100

Correct.

Case 13: n=1, a=1, b=1

- ans1 = 1

- ans2 = not applicable since n=1

- output:1

Correct.

Wait, in this case, n=1, so the program directly prints a, which is correct.

Another case: n=4, a=3, b=5

- ans1 = 12

- ans2 = 5*2 + 3*0 = 10

- min(12,10) = 10

Correct.

I can't seem to find any case where the program would fail. It seems to handle all possible scenarios correctly.

Wait, let me think about when b is less than 2*a, which is the condition when buying two yogurts together is cheaper than buying them separately.

For example, n=2, a=5, b=9

- ans1=10

- ans2=9

- min=9

Correct.

But if b >= 2*a, then buying single yogurts is cheaper.

For example, n=2, a=5, b=10

- ans1=10

- ans2=10

- min=10

Correct.

Similarly, n=3, a=5, b=11

- ans1=15

- ans2=11+5=16

- min=15

Correct.

The program seems to handle these cases correctly.

Also, for n=1, it directly prints a, which is correct since there's no promotion for a single yogurt.

I think the program is correct. I can't find any case where it would not produce the correct minimum cost.

Therefore, the correctness is True.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the normal price per yogurt and a promotional price for two yogurts.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Inputs:**
   - `n`: number of yogurts to buy.
   - `a`: price of one yogurt.
   - `b`: promotional price for two yogurts.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought at the normal price: `ans1 = a * n`.
   - Calculate the cost if as many pairs as possible are bought at the promotional price and any remaining yogurt is bought at the normal price:
     - Number of pairs: `n // 2`.
     - Remaining single yogurt: `n % 2`.
     - Cost: `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.

3. **Determine the Minimum Cost:**
   - The minimum cost is the lesser of `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is 1, the promotional price doesn't apply, so the cost is simply `a`.

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)

# To run the function, uncomment the following line
# func()
```

### Explanation
- **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
  - For each test case, read `n`, `a`, and `b`.
  - If `n` is greater than 1:
    - Compute `ans1` as the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the normal price.
    - Compute `ans2` as the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and any remaining single yogurt at the normal price.
    - Print the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
  - If `n` is 1, print the normal price `a` directly.

- **Why This Approach Works:**
  - This approach ensures that we always choose the cheaper option between buying yogurts individually or in pairs.
  - It handles edge cases appropriately, such as when `n` is odd or when buying in pairs is not beneficial.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(t), where t is the number of test cases, as it performs a constant amount of work for each test case.
