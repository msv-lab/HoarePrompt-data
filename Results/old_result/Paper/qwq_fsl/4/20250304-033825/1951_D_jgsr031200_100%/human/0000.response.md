Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to help Bob set up stalls with specific pricing so that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins. The program needs to output "YES" if it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and 10^18 coins such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, and "NO" otherwise. If "YES", it should also provide the number of stalls and their respective prices.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins. So, for each stall, she buys floor(remaining_coins / price_per_jewel) jewels and updates her remaining coins accordingly.

The program provided seems to handle this by checking if n (coins) equals k (desired jewels). If so, it sets up one stall with price 1, which makes Alice buy n jewels, matching k since n == k. If n < k, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than the coins she has if each jewel costs at least 1 coin. So, it prints "NO" in that case.

For other cases, it sets up two stalls with prices [n - k + 1, 1]. It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from these two stalls and adjusts the remaining coins accordingly. If the total jewels bought are less than k, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES" along with the number of stalls and their prices.

I need to verify if this approach always works for any n and k within the given constraints.

Let me consider some examples to test this logic.

Example 1:

Input:

3

7 3

6 4

255 8

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

NO

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

In the first test case, n=7 and k=3. The program sets up two stalls with prices [7 - 3 + 1 = 5, 1]. So, prices are [5, 1].

- At the first stall, Alice buys floor(7/5)=1 jewel, remaining coins=7-5=2.

- At the second stall, floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

Total jewels bought: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3.

In the third test case, n=255 and k=8. The program sets up two stalls with prices [255 - 8 + 1 = 248, 1].

- At the first stall, floor(255/248)=1 jewel, remaining coins=255-248=7.

- At the second stall, floor(7/1)=7 jewels.

Total jewels bought: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k=8.

Now, let's consider another example where n=5 and k=2.

- Prices: [5 - 2 + 1 = 4, 1]

- At first stall: floor(5/4)=1 jewel, remaining=5-4=1.

- At second stall: floor(1/1)=1 jewel.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2 jewels, which is correct.

Another example: n=10, k=4.

- Prices: [10 - 4 + 1 = 7, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/7)=1 jewel, remaining=10-7=3.

- Second stall: floor(3/1)=3 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 3 = 4 jewels, correct.

Seems like it works for these cases. But I need to think if there are any edge cases where this might fail.

Consider n=1, k=1.

- Prices: [1 - 1 + 1 = 1, 1]

- First stall: floor(1/1)=1 jewel, remaining=1-1=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1 jewel, correct.

Another case: n=1, k=2.

- Since n < k, it should print "NO", which the program does.

Wait, but according to the problem, each jewel costs at least 1 coin, so with n=1 and k=2, it's impossible because even if the price is 1, she can only buy 1 jewel.

Now, what if n=2, k=2.

- Prices: [2 - 2 + 1 = 1, 1]

- First stall: floor(2/1)=2 jewels, remaining=2-2=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 = 2 jewels, correct.

Another scenario: n=10, k=1.

- Prices: [10 - 1 + 1 = 10, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/10)=1 jewel, remaining=10-10=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1 jewel, correct.

Seems consistent. But let's think about a case where k is larger than n, but it's still possible because of the way prices are set.

Wait, according to the program, if n < k, it directly prints "NO", which makes sense because each jewel costs at least 1 coin.

But what if n >= k, but the program's approach doesn't work?

Let me try n=10, k=5.

- Prices: [10 - 5 + 1 = 6, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/6)=1 jewel, remaining=10-6=4.

- Second stall: floor(4/1)=4 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 4 = 5 jewels, correct.

Another case: n=100, k=10.

- Prices: [100 - 10 + 1 = 91, 1]

- First stall: floor(100/91)=1 jewel, remaining=100-91=9.

- Second stall: floor(9/1)=9 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 9 = 10 jewels, correct.

Wait, but what if n=10, k=3.

- Prices: [10 - 3 + 1 = 8, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/8)=1 jewel, remaining=10-8=2.

- Second stall: floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 2 = 3 jewels, correct.

Seems to work.

But let's consider n=5, k=1.

- Prices: [5 - 1 + 1 = 5, 1]

- First stall: floor(5/5)=1 jewel, remaining=5-5=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1 jewel, correct.

Another case: n=6, k=4.

- Prices: [6 - 4 + 1 = 3, 1]

- First stall: floor(6/3)=2 jewels, remaining=6-6=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 = 2 jewels, which is less than k=4.

According to the program, it would check h (total jewels bought) against k. Here, h=2 < 4, so it would print "NO".

But is it actually impossible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with n=6 coins?

Let's try to set up more stalls.

Suppose Bob sets up three stalls with prices [2, 2, 1].

- First stall: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, remaining=6-6=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/2)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 3 + 0 + 0 = 3 jewels, which is still less than 4.

Another setup: [3, 1, 1].

- First stall: floor(6/3)=2 jewels, remaining=6-6=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 jewels.

Another setup: [2, 1, 1].

- First stall: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, remaining=6-6=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 3 + 0 + 0 = 3 jewels.

Another setup: [1, 1, 1].

- First stall: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, remaining=6-6=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 6 + 0 + 0 = 6 jewels, which is more than 4.

So, in this case, it seems impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with n=6 coins, regardless of how many stalls and what prices Bob sets. Hence, "NO" is the correct answer, and the program correctly identifies it.

Another test case: n=10, k=3.

- Prices: [10 - 3 + 1 = 8, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/8)=1 jewel, remaining=10-8=2.

- Second stall: floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 2 = 3 jewels, correct.

But what if Bob sets up more stalls?

Suppose Bob sets up three stalls with prices [5, 3, 2].

- First stall: floor(10/5)=2 jewels, remaining=10-10=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/3)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0/2)=0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 jewels.

Not enough.

Another setup: [4, 3, 2].

- First stall: floor(10/4)=2 jewels, remaining=10-8=2.

- Second stall: floor(2/3)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(2/2)=1 jewel.

- Total: 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 jewels, which matches k=3.

So, in this case, with three stalls, it's possible. But the program only sets up two stalls and in this particular case, it happens to work with two stalls. But according to the problem, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls, so using more than two is allowed.

However, the program only sets up two stalls and checks if it's possible to get exactly k jewels with those two stalls. If not, it prints "NO". But in the case where two stalls aren't enough, but more stalls could make it possible, the program would incorrectly print "NO".

Wait, but in the earlier case with n=6 and k=4, it's impossible to get exactly 4 jewels, so "NO" is correct. In n=10 and k=3, the program's approach with two stalls works, but perhaps there are cases where two stalls aren't sufficient, but more stalls could make it possible.

Let me think of such a case.

Consider n=5, k=2.

- Prices: [5 - 2 + 1 = 4, 1]

- First stall: floor(5/4)=1 jewel, remaining=5-4=1.

- Second stall: floor(1/1)=1 jewel.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2 jewels, correct.

Another setup with three stalls: [3, 2, 1].

- First stall: floor(5/3)=1 jewel, remaining=5-3=2.

- Second stall: floor(2/2)=1 jewel, remaining=2-2=0.

- Third stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 jewels.

Same result.

Is there a case where with two stalls, h < k, but with more stalls, h == k?

Let me try n=10, k=4.

With two stalls: [10 - 4 + 1 = 7, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/7)=1 jewel, remaining=10-7=3.

- Second stall: floor(3/1)=3 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 3 = 4 jewels, which matches k=4.

So, in this case, two stalls are sufficient.

Another case: n=15, k=5.

- Prices: [15 - 5 + 1 = 11, 1]

- First stall: floor(15/11)=1 jewel, remaining=15-11=4.

- Second stall: floor(4/1)=4 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 4 = 5 jewels, correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, maybe with k > floor(n / 2).

Wait, n=10, k=7.

- Prices: [10 - 7 + 1 = 4, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/4)=2 jewels, remaining=10-8=2.

- Second stall: floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 2 = 4 jewels, which is less than 7.

But k=7 is greater than n=10, which is impossible because each jewel costs at least 1 coin. Wait, no, k can be less than or equal to n, but in this case, k=7 and n=10, which should be possible only if there are jewels costing less than 1 coin, which is not allowed. So, it's impossible, and the program would correctly identify h < k and print "NO".

Wait, but according to the program, for n=10 and k=7:

- Prices: [10 - 7 + 1 = 4, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/4)=2 jewels, remaining=10-8=2.

- Second stall: floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

- Total: 4 jewels, which is less than 7, so it would print "NO", which is correct.

Hence, seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider n=10, k=5.

- Prices: [10 - 5 + 1 = 6, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/6)=1 jewel, remaining=10-6=4.

- Second stall: floor(4/1)=4 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 4 = 5 jewels, correct.

Another case: n=10, k=6.

- Prices: [10 - 6 + 1 = 5, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/5)=2 jewels, remaining=10-10=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 = 2 jewels, which is less than 6.

Hence, h=2 < 6, so "NO".

But is it possible to set up more stalls to get exactly 6 jewels?

Let's try:

- Stalls with prices [2, 1, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/2)=5 jewels, remaining=10-10=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 5 + 0 + 0 = 5 jewels, still less than 6.

Another setup: [1, 1, 1]

- First stall: floor(10/1)=10 jewels, remaining=10-10=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 10 + 0 + 0 = 10 jewels, which is more than 6.

So, in this case, it's impossible to get exactly 6 jewels with any number of stalls, as the only possibilities are buying less than or equal to 5 jewels or more than 6 jewels. Hence, "NO" is correct.

So, the program seems to handle these cases correctly.

Let me consider another angle: what if k=1?

For any n >=1, it should be possible by setting up one stall with price n.

- For n=5, k=1:

- Prices: [5 -1 +1=5,1]

- First stall: floor(5/5)=1 jewel, remaining=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 =1, correct.

Alternatively, setting up one stall with price n=5 would also work.

But the program sets up two stalls in this case.

Is there a benefit to setting up only one stall?

In terms of minimality, perhaps, but the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so it's acceptable.

Another case: n=5, k=5.

- Prices: [5 -5 +1=1,1]

- First stall: floor(5/1)=5 jewels, remaining=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total:5 +0=5, correct.

But setting up one stall with price 1 would also work.

So, in this case, the program's approach works, even though a single stall could suffice.

Now, considering the constraints: t=1000, n and k up to 1e18.

The program's time complexity seems acceptable since it performs a constant amount of work per test case.

Also, the prices are within the allowed range [1,1e18], and the number of stalls is at most 2, which is less than 60.

Hence, it seems correct.

But to be absolutely sure, I need to think if there's any case where the program would say "YES" but it's actually impossible, or say "NO" when it's possible.

From the examples and test cases I've considered, it seems consistent.

Another test case: n=1, k=1.

- Prices: [1 -1 +1=1,1]

- First stall: floor(1/1)=1 jewel, remaining=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total:1 +0=1, correct.

n=2, k=1.

- Prices: [2 -1 +1=2,1]

- First stall: floor(2/2)=1 jewel, remaining=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total:1 +0=1, correct.

n=3, k=2.

- Prices: [3 -2 +1=2,1]

- First stall: floor(3/2)=1 jewel, remaining=1.

- Second stall: floor(1/1)=1 jewel.

- Total:1 +1=2, correct.

n=4, k=2.

- Prices: [4 -2 +1=3,1]

- First stall: floor(4/3)=1 jewel, remaining=1.

- Second stall: floor(1/1)=1 jewel.

- Total:1 +1=2, correct.

n=5, k=3.

- Prices: [5 -3 +1=3,1]

- First stall: floor(5/3)=1 jewel, remaining=2.

- Second stall: floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

- Total:1 +2=3, correct.

n=6, k=3.

- Prices: [6 -3 +1=4,1]

- First stall: floor(6/4)=1 jewel, remaining=2.

- Second stall: floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

- Total:1 +2=3, correct.

n=7, k=4.

- Prices: [7 -4 +1=4,1]

- First stall: floor(7/4)=1 jewel, remaining=3.

- Second stall: floor(3/1)=3 jewels.

- Total:1 +3=4, correct.

n=8, k=4.

- Prices: [8 -4 +1=5,1]

- First stall: floor(8/5)=1 jewel, remaining=3.

- Second stall: floor(3/1)=3 jewels.

- Total:1 +3=4, correct.

n=9, k=5.

- Prices: [9 -5 +1=5,1]

- First stall: floor(9/5)=1 jewel, remaining=4.

- Second stall: floor(4/1)=4 jewels.

- Total:1 +4=5, correct.

n=10, k=5.

- Prices: [10 -5 +1=6,1]

- First stall: floor(10/6)=1 jewel, remaining=4.

- Second stall: floor(4/1)=4 jewels.

- Total:1 +4=5, correct.

Seems consistent.

But let's consider a case where n is just enough to buy k jewels at price 1.

For example, n=100, k=100.

- Prices: [100 -100 +1=1,1]

- First stall: floor(100/1)=100 jewels, remaining=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total:100 +0=100, correct.

Another case: n=100, k=1.

- Prices: [100 -1 +1=100,1]

- First stall: floor(100/100)=1 jewel, remaining=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total:1 +0=1, correct.

Seems good.

Now, what if n=100, k=50.

- Prices: [100 -50 +1=51,1]

- First stall: floor(100/51)=1 jewel, remaining=49.

- Second stall: floor(49/1)=49 jewels.

- Total:1 +49=50, correct.

Another case: n=100, k=25.

- Prices: [100 -25 +1=76,1]

- First stall: floor(100/76)=1 jewel, remaining=24.

- Second stall: floor(24/1)=24 jewels.

- Total:1 +24=25, correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but what if n=100, k=75.

- Prices: [100 -75 +1=26,1]

- First stall: floor(100/26)=3 jewels, remaining=22.

- Second stall: floor(22/1)=22 jewels.

- Total:3 +22=25, which is less than 75.

Hence, h=25 <75, so "NO".

But is it possible to set up more stalls to get exactly 75 jewels?

Let's try setting up three stalls: [50, 25, 1].

- First stall: floor(100/50)=2 jewels, remaining=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/25)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total:2 +0 +0=2 <75.

Another setup: [10, 5, 1].

- First stall: floor(100/10)=10 jewels, remaining=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/5)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total:10 +0 +0=10 <75.

Another setup: [5, 3, 1].

- First stall: floor(100/5)=20 jewels, remaining=0.

- Second stall: floor(0/3)=0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0/1)=0 jewels.

- Total:20 +0 +0=20 <75.

Seems impossible to get exactly 75 jewels with n=100 coins, so "NO" is correct.

Hence, the program seems to handle this correctly.

Another consideration: what if k=0?

But k is a positive integer, as per the problem statement: "Today, although Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy exactly k jewels.", and "positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 1e18)", so k >=1.

Hence, no need to handle k=0.

Also, n >=1.

So, all edge cases are covered.

I can't find any case where the program's approach fails to correctly determine whether it's possible for Bob to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific pricing such that Alice buys exactly k jewels using her n coins. The solution involves a strategic approach to pricing the jewels at the stalls to control the number of jewels Alice can purchase.

## Approach

1. **Initial Check**: 
    - If `n == k`, Bob can set up a single stall with price 1. This way, Alice buys exactly `n` jewels, which matches `k`.
    - If `n < k`, it's impossible because each jewel costs at least 1 coin, so Alice cannot buy more jewels than the coins she has.

2. **General Case**:
    - Set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
    - The first stall is priced such that Alice can buy as many jewels as possible without exceeding `k`.
    - The second stall is priced at 1 coin per jewel, allowing Alice to buy additional jewels with any remaining coins.

3. **Verification**:
    - Calculate the total jewels Alice can buy from these stalls.
    - If the total jewels match `k`, output "YES" along with the stall setup.
    - If not, output "NO".

## Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        h += curr
        n -= i * curr
    if h < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(*costs)
```

## Explanation

- **Initial Check**:
  - When `n == k`, setting up a stall with price 1 allows Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
  - If `n < k`, it's impossible to buy `k` jewels since each jewel costs at least 1 coin.

- **General Case**:
  - By setting up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`, we ensure:
    - At the first stall, Alice buys as many jewels as possible without exceeding `k`.
    - At the second stall, she can buy the remaining jewels with the leftover coins.
  
- **Verification**:
  - Calculate the total jewels bought from both stalls.
  - If the total jewels equal `k`, print "YES" and the stall prices; otherwise, print "NO".

This approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by strategically setting stall prices.
