Alright, I've got this task here. I need to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. If the program meets the requirements perfectly, including handling all edge cases, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". Partial correctness isn't acceptable; it's all or nothing.

First, I need to understand the problem description thoroughly. Let's see what it's asking for.

**Problem Description:**

Anton has a permutation p of size n and a number x that needs to be found. A permutation is an array of distinct integers from 1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] and [1,3,4] are not.

I need to perform a binary search to find x in this permutation. However, binary search requires the array to be sorted, and the permutation may not be sorted. To make it work, I can perform at most two swap operations on the permutation before applying the binary search.

Each swap allows me to choose two indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) and swap the elements at these positions. After at most two such swaps, the binary search should correctly find x.

The goal is to output the number of swaps performed (0, 1, or 2) and the specific swaps done, such that when the binary search is applied, it correctly identifies x.

It's guaranteed that two swaps are always sufficient.

**Input:**

- The first line contains t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- The first line contains two integers n and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).

- The second line contains the permutation p of size n.

- It's guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases doesn't exceed 2·10^5.

**Output:**

- For each test case:

- First, output k (0 ≤ k ≤ 2), the number of swaps performed.

- Then, output k lines, each containing two integers i and j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n), the indices swapped.

**Note:**

- No need to minimize the number of operations.

- It's guaranteed that two operations are always sufficient.

**Example:**

Given in the problem statement.

**Program to Verify:**

Provided code that presumably attempts to solve the problem.

**My Task:**

Determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem as described, considering all possible test cases.

**Approach:**

1. **Understand the Program's Logic:**

   - Read and comprehend the given Python code.

   - Identify how it attempts to solve the problem.

2. **Check for Correctness:**

   - Ensure the program handles the binary search correctly after at most two swaps.

   - Verify if the swaps are necessary and correctly implemented.

   - Check edge cases and potential pitfalls.

3. **Analyze the Code Step-by-Step:**

   - Break down the code to understand each part.

   - See how it processes input and performs operations.

4. **Consider Potential Fail Cases:**

   - Think of scenarios where the program might fail.

   - Test these scenarios mentally or with sample inputs.

5. **Make a Decision:**

   - If the program handles all cases correctly, including edge cases, print "True".

   - If there's at least one case where it fails, print "False" and provide an example.

**Analyzing the Program:**

Let's look at the provided code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Reading Inputs:**

   - `func_1()` reads integers from input.

   - `func_2()` converts the input to a list.

   - `func_3()` is the main function handling each test case.

2. **Finding Position of x:**

   - `(n, k) = func_1()`: Read n and x.

   - `arr = func_2()`: Read the permutation.

   - Find the position `pos` of x in the permutation.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**

   - Initialize `low` and `high` for binary search.

   - Use a set `st` to track something (possibly mid indices).

   - Perform the binary search loop until `low + 1 < high`:

     - Calculate `mid`.

     - Add `mid` to the set `st`.

     - If `arr[mid] > k`, set `high = mid`.

     - Else, set `low = mid`.

4. **Check if x is Found:**

   - After the loop, check if `arr[low] == k`:

     - If yes, print 0 (no swaps needed).

     - If not, print 1 and swap `low + 1` with `pos + 1`.

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Assumption of Sorted Array:**

   - Binary search requires a sorted array. The permutation is not necessarily sorted.

   - The program attempts to perform binary search directly on the permutation, which may not work if the array isn't sorted.

2. **Swaps to Make Array Sorted:**

   - The problem allows up to two swaps to make the binary search work.

   - The current implementation only performs at most one swap, which might not be sufficient in some cases.

3. **Edge Cases:**

   - Consider permutations that are already sorted or nearly sorted.

   - Consider permutations where x is at the beginning or end.

   - Consider permutations where x is not present (though x is guaranteed to be in the permutation).

4. **Correctness of Swap Logic:**

   - The program swaps the position of x with the `low` index if x isn't found.

   - This might not always make the binary search find x correctly.

**Testing Mental Cases:**

Let's think of a test case where the program might fail.

**Test Case 1:**

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

- The array is already sorted.

- Binary search should find x without any swaps.

- Expected output: 0

- Program output: 0

- Correct.

**Test Case 2:**

- n = 6, x = 5

- p = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

- The array is not sorted.

- After one swap, can we make binary search find x?

- Let's see what the program does.

- Position of x (5) is index 3.

- Binary search process:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 5 == x, so it should find it.

- But in the code, the condition is `low + 1 < high`, which might not directly correspond to standard binary search.

- Need to verify the binary search implementation.

**Potential Failure Case:**

- Consider n = 4, x = 2

- p = [3, 1, 4, 2]

- The correct position for x is index 3.

- Binary search without swaps might not find it.

- The program might perform one swap, but perhaps two are needed in some cases.

- Wait, but the problem says that two swaps are always sufficient.

- The program only performs at most one swap, which might not be enough in some scenarios.

**Another Test Case:**

- n = 5, x = 1

- p = [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]

- Position of x is index 4.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 5

  - mid = 2

  - arr[2] = 4 > 1, so low = 2

  - mid = (2 + 5)//2 = 3

  - arr[3] = 2 > 1, so low = 3

  - mid = (3 + 5)//2 = 4

  - arr[4] = 1 == x, found.

- So, in this case, it finds x without swaps.

- Program output: 0

- Correct.

**Another Test Case:**

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]

- Position of x is index 1.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 5 > 3, so high = 3

  - Now low = 0, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 3 == x, found.

- So, it finds x without swaps.

- Program output: 0

- Correct.

**Potential Problematic Case:**

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

- Position of x is index 4.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 5 > 3, so high = 3

  - Now low = 0, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 4 > 3, so high = 1

  - Now low = 0, high = 1

  - arr[0] = 1 != 3

- So, it doesn't find x.

- The program will perform one swap: swap low (0) and pos (4)

- So, swap arr[0] and arr[4]: arr becomes [3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 6]

- Now, perform binary search again:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 5 > 3, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 4 > 3, high = 1

  - mid = 0

  - arr[0] = 3 == x, found.

- So, with one swap, it works.

- But is one swap always sufficient?

**Considering the Guarantee:**

The problem states that two swaps are always sufficient. The program sometimes uses one swap, which is within the limit.

But is one swap always sufficient? Or are there cases where two swaps are necessary?

If the program only performs one swap, but in some cases, two swaps are needed, then the program is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says that two swaps are always sufficient. So, in theory, one or two swaps should be enough.

But the program only performs one swap when necessary, and zero swaps when not necessary.

Is there any case where one swap is not enough, but two are needed?

Wait, according to the problem, two swaps are always sufficient, but it doesn't say that one swap is sometimes necessary.

So, perhaps one swap is sufficient in some cases, and zero in others.

But to be sure, I need to check if there's any case where one swap isn't enough.

**Another Test Case:**

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 6]

- Position of x is index 4.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 5 > 3, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 1 < 3, low = 1

  - mid = (1 + 3)//2 = 1

  - arr[1] = 1 < 3, low = 1

  - Since low + 1 < high is now 1 + 1 = 2 < 3, continue

  - mid = (1 + 3)//2 = 1

  - arr[1] = 1 < 3, low = 1

  - Loop continues indefinitely or until low + 1 < high is false.

  - Eventually, low = 1 and high = 2

  - arr[low] = 1 != 3

- So, it doesn't find x.

- The program will perform one swap: swap low (1) and pos (4)

- Swap arr[1] and arr[4]: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6]

- Now, perform binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 5 > 3, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 3 == x, found.

- So, with one swap, it works.

**Another Test Case:**

- n = 5, x = 1

- p = [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

- Position of x is 4.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 5

  - mid = 2

  - arr[2] = 4 > 1, high = 2

  - mid = 0

  - arr[0] = 2 > 1, high = 0

  - low + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 < high = 0? False, exit loop.

  - arr[low] = arr[0] = 2 != 1

- Doesn't find x.

- Program performs one swap: swap low (0) and pos (4)

- arr becomes [1, 3, 4, 5, 2]

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 5

  - mid = 2

  - arr[2] = 4 > 1, high = 2

  - mid = 0

  - arr[0] = 1 == x, found.

- Works with one swap.

**Seems Consistent:**

In all these cases, one swap is sufficient to make the binary search find x.

But is there any case where one swap isn't enough?

**Considering a Harsher Test Case:**

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [5, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3]

- Position of x is 5.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 1 < 3, low = 3

  - mid = (3 + 6)//2 = 4

  - arr[4] = 2 < 3, low = 4

  - mid = (4 + 6)//2 = 5

  - arr[5] = 3 == x, found.

- So, without any swaps, it finds x.

- Program output: 0

- Correct.

**Another Harsher Test Case:**

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]

- Position of x is 5.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 1 < 3, low = 3

  - mid = (3 + 6)//2 = 4

  - arr[4] = 2 < 3, low = 4

  - mid = (4 + 6)//2 = 5

  - arr[5] = 3 == x, found.

- Again, no swaps needed.

- Program output: 0

- Correct.

**Is One Swap Always Sufficient?**

According to the problem, two swaps are always sufficient, but it doesn't specify if one swap is sometimes necessary.

From the examples and test cases I've considered, one swap seems sufficient when needed.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

**Potential Case Where One Swap Isn't Enough:**

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [2, 4, 1, 5, 6, 3]

- Position of x is 5.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 5 > 3, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 4 > 3, high = 1

  - low + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 < high = 1? False, exit loop.

  - arr[low] = arr[0] = 2 != 3

- Doesn't find x.

- Program performs one swap: swap low (0) and pos (5)

- arr becomes [3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 2]

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 5 > 3, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 4 > 3, high = 1

  - low + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 < high = 1? False, exit loop.

  - arr[low] = arr[0] = 3 == x, found.

- Works with one swap.

**Still Works with One Swap.**

Even in this case, one swap is sufficient.

**Is There a Case Where Two Swaps Are Needed?**

Let's try to find such a case.

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [5, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3]

- Position of x is 5.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 1 < 3, low = 3

  - mid = (3 + 6)//2 = 4

  - arr[4] = 2 < 3, low = 4

  - mid = (4 + 6)//2 = 5

  - arr[5] = 3 == x, found.

- No swaps needed.

- Program output: 0

- Correct.

**Another Case:**

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [6, 5, 4, 1, 2, 3]

- Position of x is 5.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 1 < 3, low = 3

  - mid = (3 + 6)//2 = 4

  - arr[4] = 2 < 3, low = 4

  - mid = (4 + 6)//2 = 5

  - arr[5] = 3 == x, found.

- No swaps needed.

- Program output: 0

- Correct.

**Seems Consistent:**

In all these cases, either zero or one swap is sufficient.

But according to the problem, two swaps are always sufficient, but it doesn't say that one swap is always sufficient.

However, in all the cases I've considered, one swap is sufficient when needed.

Is there a specific case where one swap isn't enough?

**Considering a Permutation Where x is in the Wrong Position and Requires Two Swaps:**

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3]

- Position of x is 5.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 5 > 3, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 2 < 3, low = 1

  - mid = (1 + 3)//2 = 1

  - arr[1] = 2 < 3, low = 1

  - low + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 < high = 3? True

  - mid = (1 + 3)//2 = 1

  - arr[1] = 2 < 3, low = 1

  - Loop continues until low + 1 >= high

  - Finally, arr[low] = 2 != 3

- Doesn't find x.

- Program performs one swap: swap low (1) and pos (5)

- arr becomes [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2]

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 5 > 3, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 3 == x, found.

- Works with one swap.

**Still Works with One Swap.**

It seems that in this case as well, one swap is sufficient.

**Is There a Case Where One Swap Isn't Enough?**

Let's try a different approach.

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]

- Position of x is 5.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 1 < 3, low = 3

  - mid = (3 + 6)//2 = 4

  - arr[4] = 2 < 3, low = 4

  - mid = (4 + 6)//2 = 5

  - arr[5] = 3 == x, found.

- No swaps needed.

- Program output: 0

- Correct.

**Another Case:**

- n = 6, x = 3

- p = [5, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3]

- Position of x is 5.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 6

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 1 < 3, low = 3

  - mid = (3 + 6)//2 = 4

  - arr[4] = 2 < 3, low = 4

  - mid = (4 + 6)//2 = 5

  - arr[5] = 3 == x, found.

- No swaps needed.

- Program output: 0

- Correct.

**Seems Like One Swap is Sufficient:**

In all the cases I've thought of, one swap is sufficient when needed.

But to be thorough, I should consider more complex permutations.

**Complex Test Case:**

- n = 7, x = 3

- p = [6, 5, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3]

- Position of x is 6.

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 7

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 7 > 3, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 5 > 3, high = 1

  - low + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 < high = 1? False, exit loop.

  - arr[low] = arr[0] = 6 != 3

- Doesn't find x.

- Program performs one swap: swap low (0) and pos (6)

- arr becomes [3, 5, 4, 7, 1, 2, 6]

- Binary search:

  - low = 0, high = 7

  - mid = 3

  - arr[3] = 7 > 3, high = 3

  - mid = 1

  - arr[1] = 5 > 3, high = 1

  - low + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 < high = 1? False, exit loop.

  - arr[low] = arr[0] = 3 == x, found.

- Works with one swap.

**Still Works.**

**Is There a Case Where One Swap Isn't Enough?**

I'm starting to think that one swap is always sufficient, but the problem says two swaps are always sufficient, which doesn't preclude the possibility that one swap might not be enough in some cases.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

**Alternative Approach:**

Maybe there are cases where swapping x to the correct position isn't enough, and additional swaps are needed to make the array sorted enough for binary search to work.

But in the cases I've considered, swapping x to the position where the binary search expects it seems to be sufficient.

**Another Perspective:**

Maybe the issue is with the binary search implementation in the program.

Looking back at the code:

```python

while low + 1 < high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    st.add(mid)

    if arr[mid] > k:

        high = mid

    else:

        low = mid

```

This seems like a standard binary search, but the condition `low + 1 < high` is unusual.
