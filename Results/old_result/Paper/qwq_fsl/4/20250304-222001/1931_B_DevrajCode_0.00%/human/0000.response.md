Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a lower index to one with a higher index. The sum of the water in all containers is guaranteed to be divisible by the number of containers, which means there is a target amount each container should have.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. We have n containers, each containing a certain amount of water. We can only pour water from a container with a smaller index to one with a larger index. We need to check if it's possible to make the water in all containers equal by performing any number of such operations.

The key constraints are:
- We can only pour water from a container with a lower index to one with a higher index.
- The total sum of water is divisible by the number of containers, so there is a target amount each container should reach.

Given that, the program provided is:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

Wait a minute, the problem description mentions that the sum is guaranteed to be divisible by n, so the check `if total_water % n != 0` is redundant. But it doesn't hurt to have it there, especially if it's a safeguard.

The main logic seems to be in keeping a running sum (`container`) of the difference between each container's water and the target amount. If this running sum ever goes negative, it means that at some point, we don't have enough water in the earlier containers to make up for the deficit in the current container, given the pouring direction constraint.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let's consider the example provided:

Input:

6

1

43

2

1 3

5

4 5 2 1 3

3

1 2 3

7

4 5 5 0 6 4 4

7

6 5 5 1 3 4 4

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

NO

YES

For the third test case:

n = 5

a = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]

target = sum(a) // n = 15 // 5 = 3

Now, let's compute the running sum:

- Start with container = 0

- For a[0] = 4: container += 4 - 3 = 1

- For a[1] = 5: container += 5 - 3 = 2 (1 + 2 = 3)

- For a[2] = 2: container += 2 - 3 = -1 (3 + (-1) = 2)

- For a[3] = 1: container += 1 - 3 = -2 (2 + (-2) = 0)

- For a[4] = 3: container += 3 - 3 = 0 (0 + 0 = 0)

The running sum never goes negative, so it should return 'Yes', which matches the expected output.

But wait, in the explanation, they perform several pours to make all containers equal. So, the logic seems to be working for this case.

Now, let's think about why this logic works.

The idea is that for each container, if it has more water than the target, it can pour the excess to the containers with higher indices. If it has less, it needs to receive water from the containers with lower indices. However, since we can only pour from lower to higher indices, we need to ensure that at any point, the cumulative excess from the previous containers can cover the deficit in the current container.

So, the running sum represents the cumulative excess or deficit up to the current container. If it ever goes negative, it means there's a deficit that cannot be covered by the excess from the previous containers, given the pouring direction constraint.

Therefore, if the running sum never goes negative, it should be possible to make all containers equal.

Let me try to find a case where this logic fails.

Consider n=3 and a=[1, 2, 3]. Sum is 6, which is divisible by 3. Target is 2.

Compute running sum:

- container += 1 - 2 = -1 (negative, should return 'No')

Indeed, in the sample input, for n=3 and a=[1,2,3], the output is 'No', which matches.

Another sample input: n=1, a=[43]. Sum is 43, which is divisible by 1. Target is 43.

Running sum:

- container += 43 - 43 = 0

Never negative, should return 'Yes', which matches the sample output.

Another sample input: n=2, a=[1,3]. Sum is 4, divisible by 2. Target is 2.

Running sum:

- container += 1 - 2 = -1 (negative, should return 'No')

Which matches the sample output.

Now, let's think about another case: n=4, a=[4,0,0,4]. Sum is 8, divisible by 4. Target is 2.

Running sum:

- container += 4 - 2 = 2

- container += 0 - 2 = 2 + (-2) = 0

- container += 0 - 2 = 0 + (-2) = -2 (negative, should return 'No')

But, is it actually possible to make all containers equal in this case?

Let's see:

- Start with [4,0,0,4]

- Pour from container 1 to container 2: [3,1,0,4]

- Pour from container 1 to container 3: [2,1,1,4]

- Pour from container 4 to container 2: [2,2,1,3]

- Pour from container 4 to container 3: [2,2,2,2]

Wait, in this sequence, I poured from container 4 to container 2, which is pouring from a higher index to a lower one, which is not allowed.

Given the constraint that we can only pour from a lower index to a higher one, is it possible to achieve the equal distribution?

Let's try:

- Start with [4,0,0,4]

- Pour 2 units from container 1 to container 2: [2,2,0,4]

- Pour 2 units from container 1 to container 3: [2,2,2,4]

- Pour 2 units from container 4 to container 3: [2,2,4,2]

Wait, pouring from container 4 to container 3 is allowed since 4 > 3.

But in the previous step, after pouring from container 1 to container 3, we have [2,2,2,4], which is already equal. So, 'Yes' should be the answer.

But according to the program's logic, the running sum would be:

- container += 4 - 2 = 2

- container += 0 - 2 = 2 + (-2) = 0

- container += 0 - 2 = 0 + (-2) = -2 (negative, should return 'No')

But in reality, it's possible to make all containers equal by pouring from higher to lower indices, but the program only allows pouring from lower to higher indices.

Wait, but according to the problem, we can only pour from lower to higher indices.

In the sequence I tried above, pouring from container 4 to container 3 is not allowed because 4 > 3, which violates the constraint.

So, in reality, it's not possible to make all containers equal in this case, given the pouring constraint.

Therefore, the program correctly returns 'No' for this case.

Wait, but in my earlier attempt, I thought it was possible, but that involved invalid pours.

So, the program's logic seems correct.

Let me think of another case.

Consider n=4, a=[3,3,3,3]. Sum is 12, divisible by 4. Target is 3.

Running sum:

- container += 3 - 3 = 0

- container += 3 - 3 = 0

- container += 3 - 3 = 0

- container += 3 - 3 = 0

Never negative, should return 'Yes', which is correct.

Another case: n=3, a=[0,0,0]. Sum is 0, divisible by 3. Target is 0.

Running sum:

- container += 0 - 0 = 0

- container += 0 - 0 = 0

- container += 0 - 0 = 0

Should return 'Yes', which is correct.

Let's try a case where the running sum doesn't go negative, but it's still impossible.

Is that possible? I need to find such a case.

Wait, if the running sum never goes negative, according to the program's logic, it should be possible to make all containers equal.

So, if I can find a case where the running sum never goes negative, but it's still impossible to make all containers equal, then the program is incorrect.

Let me try n=3, a=[2,2,2]. Sum is 6, divisible by 3. Target is 2.

Running sum:

- container += 2 - 2 = 0

- container += 2 - 2 = 0

- container += 2 - 2 = 0

Should return 'Yes', which is correct.

Another case: n=4, a=[1,3,1,3]. Sum is 8, divisible by 4. Target is 2.

Running sum:

- container += 1 - 2 = -1 (negative, return 'No')

But is it possible to make all containers equal?

- Start with [1,3,1,3]

- Pour from container 2 to container 3: [1,2,2,3]

- Pour from container 4 to container 3: [1,2,3,2]

Wait, again, pouring from higher to lower indices is not allowed.

Given the constraint, can we make all containers equal?

- Pour from container 2 to container 1: [2,2,1,3]

- Pour from container 3 to container 4: [2,2,2,2]

But pouring from container 3 to container 4 is allowed since 3 < 4.

Wait, in this sequence, we first pour from container 2 to container 1, which is allowed (2 > 1), and then pour from container 3 to container 4, which is allowed (3 < 4).

But in the first step, pouring from container 2 to container 1 violates the constraint because 2 > 1, meaning we're pouring from a higher index to a lower one, which is not allowed.

So, actually, this sequence is invalid.

Therefore, in reality, it's not possible to make all containers equal in this case, given the pouring constraint.

Hence, the program correctly returns 'No'.

So, the program's logic seems sound.

Let me consider another case: n=5, a=[3,3,3,3,3]. Sum is 15, divisible by 5. Target is 3.

Running sum:

- container += 3 - 3 = 0

- container += 3 - 3 = 0

- container += 3 - 3 = 0

- container += 3 - 3 = 0

- container += 3 - 3 = 0

Should return 'Yes', which is correct.

Another case: n=2, a=[0,4]. Sum is 4, divisible by 2. Target is 2.

Running sum:

- container += 0 - 2 = -2 (negative, return 'No')

Is it possible to make both containers equal?

- We can only pour from container 1 to container 2, but container 1 has 0, so no water can be poured.

- Hence, it's impossible to make both containers equal, so 'No' is correct.

Another case: n=3, a=[1,2,3]. Sum is 6, divisible by 3. Target is 2.

Running sum:

- container += 1 - 2 = -1 (negative, return 'No')

As before, it's impossible given the pouring constraints.

Seems like the program is correct.

Wait, but in the earlier case I thought about n=4, a=[4,0,0,4], which according to the program should return 'No', and indeed, it's not possible given the constraints.

So, I can't find any case where the program returns an incorrect answer.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
