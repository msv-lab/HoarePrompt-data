Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to handle constraints on an integer k and count how many integers k satisfy all these constraints. The constraints are of three types: k must be greater than or equal to x, k must be less than or equal to x, or k must be not equal to x. The problem guarantees that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, ensuring a finite number of possible k values.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. There are multiple test cases, each with a number of constraints. For each test case, I have to find the number of integers k that satisfy all the given constraints.

Looking at the program provided, it seems to follow the logic I would expect:

1. It reads the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case, it reads n, the number of constraints.

3. It then reads n pairs of a and x, where a indicates the type of constraint and x is the value involved.

4. It keeps track of the maximum lower bound (bx) for constraints of type 1 (k >= x), and the minimum upper bound (ax) for constraints of type 2 (k <= x). For constraints of type 3 (k != x), it collects these x values in a set cx.

5. After processing all constraints for a test case, it checks if the lower bound bx is greater than the upper bound ax. If bx > ax, it's impossible for any k to satisfy these constraints, so the result is 0.

6. Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers between bx and ax inclusive, which is ax - bx + 1, and subtracts the number of constraints of type 3 that fall within this range.

The program seems straightforward, but I need to verify if it handles all edge cases correctly.

Let me think about potential edge cases:

- All constraints are of type 1 and 2, with no type 3 constraints. In this case, the program should simply calculate ax - bx + 1, provided bx <= ax.

- Only one type 1 and one type 2 constraint, with no type 3 constraints.

- Multiple type 1 constraints, where bx is the maximum of all x in type 1.

- Multiple type 2 constraints, where ax is the minimum of all x in type 2.

- Type 3 constraints that fall within the range [bx, ax], which should be excluded from the count.

- Type 3 constraints that are outside the range [bx, ax], which should not affect the count.

- Cases where bx > ax after considering all type 1 and type 2 constraints, meaning no possible k satisfies the constraints.

- Cases where bx == ax and there is a type 3 constraint with x == bx, which should result in 0 if bx == x, since k cannot be equal to x.

Let me consider a specific example to see if the program handles it correctly.

Example 1 from the problem:

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

Output:

7

90

0

800000000

Let's take the first test case:

n = 4

Constraints:

1 3 → k >= 3

2 10 → k <= 10

3 1 → k != 1

3 5 → k != 5

So, bx = max(3, ) = 3

ax = min(10, ) = 10

cx = {1, 5}

Now, check if bx > ax: 3 <= 10, so proceed.

Calculate the number of integers from 3 to 10 inclusive: 8.

Subtract the number of type 3 constraints within this range: 1 (since k != 5, but k != 1 is outside the range).

So, 8 - 1 = 7, which matches the expected output.

Another test case:

n = 2

Constraints:

1 5 → k >= 5

2 4 → k <= 4

Here, bx = 5 and ax = 4.

Since bx > ax (5 > 4), output 0, which matches the expected output.

Now, let's think about a case where multiple type 1 constraints are present.

Suppose n = 3

Constraints:

1 2

1 3

2 5

Here, bx = max(2, 3) = 3

ax = 5

cx = empty

So, number of k from 3 to 5 inclusive: 3.

No type 3 constraints within this range, so answer is 3.

Seems correct.

Another case:

n = 3

Constraints:

1 1

2 10

3 1

Here, bx = 1, ax = 10

cx = {1}

So, number of k from 1 to 10: 10

Subtract 1 for k != 1

Answer: 9

Seems correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed that no two constraints are the same, so having two type 1 constraints with different x values is allowed, as long as no two constraints are exactly the same (same a and same x).

Now, let's consider a case where bx > ax after considering all constraints.

n = 3

Constraints:

1 5

2 4

3 6

Here, bx = 5, ax =4

bx > ax, so output 0.

Correct.

Another case:

n = 1

But according to the problem, n >=2, so no need to consider n=1.

Wait, the problem says n >=2, so all test cases will have at least 2 constraints.

Let me consider a case where ax - bx +1 is large, and there are many type 3 constraints within the range.

n=5

Constraints:

1 1

2 100

3 10

3 20

3 30

Here, bx=1, ax=100

cx={10,20,30}

Number of k from 1 to 100: 100

Subtract 3 for k !=10,20,30

Answer: 97

Seems correct.

Wait, but according to the program, it's cx = set(), and then adding x for a=3.

But in the program, it's cx.add(x) for a=3.

Then, it calculates tmp as the number of x in cx that are within [bx, ax].

Then, the answer is ax - bx +1 - tmp.

Seems correct.

Another potential edge case:

n=2

Constraints:

1 1

2 1

Here, bx=1, ax=1

cx=empty

Answer:1 - 0 =1

But if there is a type 3 constraint:

n=3

Constraints:

1 1

2 1

3 1

Then, bx=1, ax=1

cx={1}

Answer:1 -1=0

Correct.

Another case:

n=4

Constraints:

1 1

2 10

3 5

3 5

Wait, but the problem says no two constraints are the exact same, so having two a=3 with the same x is not allowed.

So, in this case, it's guaranteed that all (a,x) pairs are distinct.

Hence, no duplicates.

So, in the above case, having two a=3 with x=5 is invalid according to the problem.

Hence, no need to consider such cases.

Now, considering the program, it uses a set for cx, which automatically handles duplicates, but according to the problem, duplicates won't occur.

Looking back at the program:

It reads t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Reads n

- Initializes cx as a set()

- Initializes bx as -1 (but later set to the maximum x from a=1 constraints)

- Initializes ax as a large number (1000000000.0 +7, which is unnecessary, but it works)

- For each of n constraints:

- Read a and x

- If a==1, bx = max(bx, x)

- If a==2, ax = min(ax, x)

- If a==3, add x to cx

- After processing all constraints:

- If bx > ax, append 0 to results

- Else:

- Initialize tmp=0

- For each i in cx:

- If i >= bx and i <= ax:

- tmp +=1

- Append ax - bx +1 - tmp to results

Finally, print all results separated by newline.

Seems correct.

But I need to think if there are any potential issues.

Potential issues could be:

- Integer overflow: but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no issue.

- Incorrect handling of constraints: but seems to handle max of type 1 and min of type 2 correctly.

- Type 3 constraints: only subtract those x that are within the final [bx, ax] range.

Wait, but in the problem, k must satisfy all constraints, so any k that equals x for a=3 is invalid, even if it's outside the [bx, ax] range. But in the program, it only subtracts type 3 constraints that are within [bx, ax].

Is this correct?

Wait, no. Because if k is outside [bx, ax], it doesn't satisfy the type 1 and type 2 constraints, so only k within [bx, ax] need to be considered. Hence, only type 3 constraints within this range need to be subtracted.

So, the program is correct in only considering type 3 constraints within [bx, ax].

Another potential issue: what if cx contains duplicates? But since cx is a set, duplicates are automatically handled.

But according to the problem, all (a,x) pairs are distinct, so no duplicates in cx.

Hence, no issue.

Another potential issue: what if bx == ax and there is a type 3 constraint with x == bx?

Then, tmp=1, and ax - bx +1 =1 -1=0, which is correct.

Another case: bx == ax and no type 3 constraints.

Then, answer is 1.

Seems correct.

Another case: bx == ax and multiple type 3 constraints, but only one with x == bx.

Then, tmp=1, and answer is 0.

Correct.

Seems like the program handles all these cases correctly.

I can't think of any input where the program would give an incorrect answer based on the problem description.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
