Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, I need to understand the problem description fully. The task is to find a permutation of length n (where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and up to 10^5) such that there don't exist two distinct indices i and j (with 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. The program needs to output such a permutation for each test case.

The program provided is:

```

for _ in range(int(input())):

    func_1()

def func_1():

    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))

    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

    print(*a)

```

Let me try to understand what this code is doing. It seems to read the number of test cases from input, then for each test case, it calls func_1(). Func_1() reads the value of n for that test case, creates a list a from 1 to n inclusive, then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based), and prints the list.

So, for example, if n=4:

Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4]

After reversing every second element: [4, 2, 3, 1]

Similarly, for n=3:

Original list: [1, 2, 3]

After reversing every second element: [3, 2, 1]

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, for n=4, the output is [4,1,2,3], but according to this code, it should be [4,2,3,1]. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe I need to check the code again.

Wait, in Python, list slicing a[::2] gets elements at even indices (0,2,4,...). So a[::2] = a[::2][::-1] reverses these elements.

For n=4:

a = [1,2,3,4]

a[::2] = [1,3]

Reversing [1,3] gives [3,1]

So a becomes [3,2,1,4]

Wait, but in the example, for n=4, the output is [4,1,2,3], which is different from [3,2,1,4]. So perhaps this code is not matching the example provided. Maybe I misread the code.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-execute this step.

a = list(range(1, n+1)) # for n=4, a=[1,2,3,4]

a[::2] = a[::2][::-1] # a[::2] is [1,3], reversed to [3,1]

So a becomes [3,2,1,4]

But in the example, for n=4, the output is [4,1,2,3]. So there's a mismatch. Maybe this code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there are multiple correct permutations, and the code is generating a different one. But according to the problem, any permutation that satisfies the condition is acceptable. So if the code generates a permutation that satisfies the condition, it's fine.

I need to check if the permutation generated by this code satisfies the condition for all n.

Let me try to understand the condition:

There should not exist two distinct indices i and j (with 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

In other words, for all pairs (i,j) where i ≠ j, it should not be the case that p_j is divisible by p_i and p_{j+1} is divisible by p_{i+1}.

Alternatively, for no two distinct pairs (i,i+1) and (j,j+1) should both p_j be divisible by p_i and p_{j+1} be divisible by p_{i+1}.

Wait, I need to be careful with the indices.

Given that i and j are between 1 and n-1, inclusive, and i ≠ j.

So, for each pair (i,j), check if p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

If there exists even one such pair, the permutation is invalid.

The code generates a permutation by reversing every second element of the list from 1 to n.

Let me test this code with n=4.

a = [1,2,3,4]

a[::2] = [1,3][::-1] = [3,1]

So a becomes [3,2,1,4]

Now, check for all possible i and j:

Possible pairs (i,j):

(1,2): check if p_1=3 divides p_2=2 and p_2=2 divides p_3=1

3 does not divide 2, so condition not satisfied.

(1,3): check if p_1=3 divides p_3=1 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4

3 does not divide 1, condition not satisfied.

(2,3): check if p_2=2 divides p_3=1 and p_3=1 divides p_4=4

2 does not divide 1, condition not satisfied.

So, for n=4, this permutation seems valid.

But according to the example, [4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation, but the code generates [3,2,1,4]. Both seem valid.

Let me check for n=3.

a = [1,2,3]

a[::2] = [1,3][::-1] = [3,1]

So a becomes [3,2,1]

According to the problem, all 6 permutations are valid for n=3, so [3,2,1] is acceptable.

Now, let's check for n=5.

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

a[::2] = [1,3,5][::-1] = [5,3,1]

So a becomes [5,2,3,4,1]

Check for all possible (i,j):

(1,2): p_1=5 divides p_2=2? No

(1,3): p_1=5 divides p_3=3? No

(1,4): p_1=5 divides p_4=4? No

(2,3): p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No

(2,4): p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, but check p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No

(3,4): p_3=3 divides p_4=4? No

So, no pair satisfies both conditions.

Seems valid.

Another test case: n=6

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = [1,3,5][::-1] = [5,3,1]

So a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Check pairs:

(1,2): p_1=5 divides p_2=2? No

(1,3): p_1=5 divides p_3=3? No

(1,4): p_1=5 divides p_4=4? No

(1,5): p_1=5 divides p_5=1? Yes, and p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes

Wait, p_1=5 divides p_5=1? 5 does not divide 1.

Wait, 5 does not divide 1, so condition not satisfied.

Similarly, check other pairs.

(2,3): p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No

(2,4): p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No

(2,5): p_2=2 divides p_5=1? No

(3,4): p_3=3 divides p_4=4? No

(3,5): p_3=3 divides p_5=1? No

(4,5): p_4=4 divides p_5=1? No

So, no pair satisfies both conditions.

Still valid.

Another test case: n=7

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7][::-1] = [7,5,3,1]

So a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Check pairs:

(1,2): p_1=7 divides p_2=2? No

(1,3): p_1=7 divides p_3=5? No

(1,4): p_1=7 divides p_4=4? No

(1,5): p_1=7 divides p_5=3? No

(1,6): p_1=7 divides p_6=6? No

(2,3): p_2=2 divides p_3=5? No

(2,4): p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No

(2,5): p_2=2 divides p_5=3? No

(2,6): p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_7=1? No

(3,4): p_3=5 divides p_4=4? No

(3,5): p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No

(3,6): p_3=5 divides p_6=6? No

(4,5): p_4=4 divides p_5=3? No

(4,6): p_4=4 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_5=3 divides p_7=1? Yes

Wait, p_4=4 divides p_6=6? Yes (6/4=1.5, but 4*1.5=6, so yes)

Wait, but p_5=3 divides p_7=1? 3 does not divide 1.

So, condition not satisfied because both conditions need to be true simultaneously.

So, still valid.

Wait, but 4 divides 6 is true only if 6 is a multiple of 4, which 6/4=1.5, which is not an integer, so 4 does not divide 6. Wait, I think I made a mistake.

4 divides 6 means 6 is a multiple of 4, which it is not, since 4*1=4 and 4*2=8, which are not 6. So, 4 does not divide 6.

Therefore, the condition for (i=4,j=6) is not satisfied because p_4 does not divide p_6.

So, no pair satisfies both conditions.

Still valid.

Hmm, seems like this code is generating a permutation that satisfies the condition for these test cases.

Is there a general pattern here?

The code reverses every second element of the list from 1 to n.

So, for even positions, the elements remain the same, and for odd positions, they are reversed.

Wait, no.

Wait, a[::2] are the elements at indices 0,2,4,..., which are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc., positions in 1-based indexing.

So, it reverses these elements.

For example, for n=4:

Original: [1,2,3,4]

After reversing [1,3] to [3,1], so [3,2,1,4]

For n=5:

[1,2,3,4,5] -> [5,2,3,4,1]

For n=6:

[1,2,3,4,5,6] -> [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Wait, for n=6, a[::2] = [1,3,5] -> reversed to [5,3,1], so a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

I need to see if this pattern guarantees that no such i and j exist.

Is there a mathematical justification for this approach?

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to construct such a permutation.

Looking back at the problem, it says that for at least one p, it exists, so we need to find any such p.

I need to verify if the code's approach always generates a valid permutation.

Another way to look at it is to see if there's any pair (i,j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

To make sure this doesn't happen, perhaps we can arrange the permutation such that for any i and j, either p_i does not divide p_j or p_{i+1} does not divide p_{j+1}.

One strategy could be to arrange the numbers in a way that avoids such divisibility relationships.

The code seems to be reversing every second element, but I'm not sure if this guarantees the condition.

Maybe I should look for a counterexample where the code's permutation fails the condition.

Let's try n=8.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7][::-1] = [7,5,3,1]

So a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

Check pairs:

(1,2): p_1=7 divides p_2=2? No

(1,3): p_1=7 divides p_3=5? No

(1,4): p_1=7 divides p_4=4? No

(1,5): p_1=7 divides p_5=3? No

(1,6): p_1=7 divides p_6=6? No

(1,7): p_1=7 divides p_7=1? No

(2,3): p_2=2 divides p_3=5? No

(2,4): p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No

(2,5): p_2=2 divides p_5=3? No

(2,6): p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_3=5 divides p_7=1? No

(2,7): p_2=2 divides p_7=1? No

(3,4): p_3=5 divides p_4=4? No

(3,5): p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No

(3,6): p_3=5 divides p_6=6? No

(3,7): p_3=5 divides p_7=1? No

(4,5): p_4=4 divides p_5=3? No

(4,6): p_4=4 divides p_6=6? 4 does not divide 6

(4,7): p_4=4 divides p_7=1? No

(5,6): p_5=3 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_6=6 divides p_7=1? No

(5,7): p_5=3 divides p_7=1? No

(6,7): p_6=6 divides p_7=1? No

So, no pair satisfies both conditions.

Still valid.

Wait, but what if n=9?

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7,9][::-1] = [9,7,5,3,1]

So a becomes [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1]

Check pairs:

(1,2): p_1=9 divides p_2=2? No

(1,3): p_1=9 divides p_3=7? No

(1,4): p_1=9 divides p_4=4? No

(1,5): p_1=9 divides p_5=5? No

(1,6): p_1=9 divides p_6=6? No

(1,7): p_1=9 divides p_7=3? Yes, and p_2=2 divides p_8=8? Yes

Wait, p_1=9 divides p_7=3? 9 does not divide 3 because 3/9=0.333... which is not an integer. So, 9 does not divide 3.

Wait, but 3 is divisible by 9 only if 9 divides 3, which it doesn't. Wait, no, 3 is not divisible by 9.

Wait, divisibility goes like this: a divides b if b is a multiple of a, i.e., b % a == 0.

So, 9 divides 3? 3 % 9 == 3, which is not 0, so 9 does not divide 3.

Therefore, the condition is not satisfied.

So, in this case, it's still valid.

Wait, but I think I need to double-check the divisibility.

Wait, in programming terms, a divides b if b % a == 0.

So, for p_i to divide p_j, p_j % p_i == 0.

Similarly, p_{i+1} to divide p_{j+1}, p_{j+1} % p_{i+1} == 0.

In the above case:

i=1, j=7:

p_1=9, p_j=3

3 % 9 != 0, so condition not satisfied.

Similarly, for other pairs, it seems to hold.

Is there a general pattern or a mathematical proof that this method works for all n?

Alternatively, maybe I should look for a specific n where this method fails.

Let's try n=10.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7,9][::-1] = [9,7,5,3,1]

So a becomes [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1,10]

Check pairs:

(1,2): p_1=9 divides p_2=2? No

(1,3): p_1=9 divides p_3=7? No

(1,4): p_1=9 divides p_4=4? No

(1,5): p_1=9 divides p_5=5? No

(1,6): p_1=9 divides p_6=6? No

(1,7): p_1=9 divides p_7=3? 3 % 9 != 0

(1,8): p_1=9 divides p_8=8? No

(1,9): p_1=9 divides p_9=1? No

(2,3): p_2=2 divides p_3=7? No

(2,4): p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_5=5? No

(2,5): p_2=2 divides p_5=5? No

(2,6): p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No

(2,7): p_2=2 divides p_7=3? No

(2,8): p_2=2 divides p_8=8? Yes, and p_3=7 divides p_9=1? No

(2,9): p_2=2 divides p_9=1? No

(3,4): p_3=7 divides p_4=4? No

(3,5): p_3=7 divides p_5=5? No

(3,6): p_3=7 divides p_6=6? No

(3,7): p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No

(3,8): p_3=7 divides p_8=8? No

(3,9): p_3=7 divides p_9=1? No

(4,5): p_4=4 divides p_5=5? No

(4,6): p_4=4 divides p_6=6? 4 does not divide 6

(4,7): p_4=4 divides p_7=3? No

(4,8): p_4=4 divides p_8=8? Yes, and p_5=5 divides p_9=1? No

(5,6): p_5=5 divides p_6=6? No

(5,7): p_5=5 divides p_7=3? No

(5,8): p_5=5 divides p_8=8? No

(5,9): p_5=5 divides p_9=1? No

(6,7): p_6=6 divides p_7=3? 6 does not divide 3

(6,8): p_6=6 divides p_8=8? No

(6,9): p_6=6 divides p_9=1? No

(7,8): p_7=3 divides p_8=8? No

(7,9): p_7=3 divides p_9=1? No

(8,9): p_8=8 divides p_9=1? No

So, again, no pair satisfies both conditions.

Seems valid.

Wait, maybe I need to look for larger n or specific values where the code's approach might fail.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the properties of the permutation generated by this code.

The code reverses every second element of the list from 1 to n.

So, for odd positions (1-based), it places the largest available numbers in descending order, while even positions remain with smaller numbers in ascending order.

For example, for n=4: [3,2,1,4]

For n=5: [5,2,3,4,1]

For n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Wait, n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

It seems like the odd positions have numbers in descending order from the highest available, and even positions have numbers in ascending order starting from 2.

Wait, n=4: [3,2,1,4]

n=5: [5,2,3,4,1]

n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Wait, in n=6, a[::2] = [1,3,5] -> [5,3,1]

So a becomes [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Similarly, for n=7: [5,2,3,4,1,6,7]

Wait, no, for n=7: a[::2] = [1,3,5,7] -> [7,5,3,1]

So a becomes [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Seems like for odd n, the first element is n, then every second element decreases by 2, and even positions are filled with remaining numbers in ascending order.

Wait, but for n=5: [5,2,3,4,1]

For n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

For n=7: [7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

It's not entirely consistent.

I need to see if there's a pattern in how the numbers are arranged.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that this code is trying to maximize or minimize certain divisions, but I'm not sure.

Maybe I should consider specific cases where divisibility is likely, such as when numbers are multiples of each other.

For example, n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Check pairs where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

For instance, i=2, j=6:

p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes, 6 % 2 == 0

p_3=3 divides p_7=1? 1 % 3 != 0

So, both conditions are not satisfied simultaneously.

Another pair: i=4, j=6:

p_4=4 divides p_6=6? 6 % 4 != 0

So, condition not satisfied.

Seems fine.

Wait, maybe try n=10: [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1,10]

Check i=2, j=6:

p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes

p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No

Another pair: i=4, j=8:

p_4=4 divides p_8=8? Yes

p_5=5 divides p_9=1? No

Seems okay.

Wait, maybe try n=12.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7,9,11][::-1] = [11,9,7,5,3,1]

So a becomes [11,2,9,4,7,6,5,8,3,10,1,12]

Check pairs:

This is getting time-consuming to check manually.

Maybe I should look for a general proof or find a specific counterexample where the code's permutation fails the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the properties of the permutation generated by this code.

The code reverses every second element, which are the odd indices in 1-based indexing.

So, in 0-based indexing, it reverses elements at even indices.

This effectively places the largest available numbers at the beginning of the permutation at odd positions, while even positions have smaller numbers.

Perhaps this arrangement minimizes the chances of having p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} for any i and j.

But I need to confirm if this is always true.

Let me consider n=15.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15][::-1] = [15,13,11,9,7,5,3,1]

So a becomes [15,2,13,4,11,6,9,8,7,10,5,12,3,14,1]

Now, check for pairs where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

This is getting too big to check manually.

Maybe I can think of a specific case where the code's permutation fails.

Suppose n=8: [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

Check i=3, j=6:

p_3=5 divides p_6=6? 6 % 5 != 0

p_4=4 divides p_7=1? 1 % 4 != 0

No issue.

Another pair: i=2, j=4:

p_2=2 divides p_4=4? Yes

p_3=5 divides p_5=3? No

No issue.

Wait, maybe try n=9: [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1]

Check i=1, j=7:

p_1=9 divides p_7=3? 3 % 9 != 0

No issue.

Another pair: i=4, j=6:

p_4=4 divides p_6=6? 6 % 4 != 0

No issue.

Seems fine.

Wait, maybe try n=12: [11,2,9,4,7,6,5,8,3,10,1,12]

Check i=2, j=6:

p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes

p_3=9 divides p_7=5? No

No issue.

Another pair: i=4, j=8:

p_4=4 divides p_8=8? Yes

p_5=7 divides p_9=3? No

No issue.

Seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that in this permutation, the odd positions have larger numbers decreasing, and even positions have smaller numbers increasing, which might minimize the chances of divisibility in both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

But I still don't have a definitive proof that this approach always works.

Maybe I should look for a specific n where this method fails.

Let's try n=14.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7,9,11,13][::-1] = [13,11,9,7,5,3,1]

So a becomes [13,2,11,4,9,6,7,8,5,10,3,12,1,14]

Now, check for pairs where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

This is getting too time-consuming.

Maybe I should consider writing a small script to check for a larger n, but since I don't have the capability to run code, I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the properties of divisibility in this arrangement.

In this permutation, odd positions have larger numbers decreasing, and even positions have smaller numbers increasing.

So, for p_i to divide p_j, where p_i is larger than p_j, it's less likely, especially since p_i is larger and p_j is smaller.

Wait, but divisibility can happen if p_j is a multiple of p_i.

But in this arrangement, p_i is larger, and p_j could be smaller, so p_j cannot be a multiple of p_i unless p_i=1, which is not the case here.

Wait, no, 6 is divisible by 3, even though 6 > 3.

Wait, but in this arrangement, p_i is from the odd positions, which have larger numbers, and p_j is from other positions.

Wait, in the code's permutation, odd positions have larger numbers, and even positions have smaller numbers.

So, for p_i divides p_j, it would require p_j to be a multiple of p_i, but since p_i is larger, this is only possible if p_i=1 or p_j is larger than p_i and a multiple of it.

But in this arrangement, p_i is large, and p_j could be smaller, so it's less likely.

Similarly, p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} would require p_{j+1} to be a multiple of p_{i+1}.

Given that p_{i+1} is from an even position, which has smaller numbers, and p_{j+1} could be larger or smaller.

It seems that the code's approach minimizes the chances of both conditions being true simultaneously.

But without a general proof, I need to look for a specific counterexample.

Let's try n=15 again: [15,2,13,4,11,6,9,8,7,10,5,12,3,14,1]

Check pairs where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

For example, i=2, j=6:

p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes

p_3=13 divides p_7=9? 9 % 13 != 0

No issue.

Another pair: i=4, j=8:

p_4=4 divides p_8=8? Yes

p_5=11 divides p_9=7? No

No issue.

Another pair: i=6, j=10:

p_6=6 divides p_10=10? 10 % 6 != 0

No issue.

Seems fine.

Wait, maybe try i=3, j=9:

p_3=13 divides p_9=7? No

No issue.

Another pair: i=5, j=11:

p_5=11 divides p_11=5? No

No issue.

Seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that in this permutation, the odd positions have numbers that are likely to be prime or large, reducing the chances of divisibility.

But again, without a general proof, I need to find a specific case where the code's permutation fails.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that for certain n, where n is even and large, there might be pairs where both conditions are satisfied.

But after checking several cases, I haven't found such a pair yet.

Maybe the code's approach is correct, and I'm just not able to find a counterexample.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect, but I need to think harder to find a counterexample.

Wait, maybe try n=10 again: [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1,10]

Check i=2, j=6:

p_2=2 divides p_6=6? Yes

p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No

No issue.

Another pair: i=4, j=8:

p_4=4 divides p_8=8? Yes

p_5=5 divides p_9=1? No

No issue.

Another pair: i=6, j=10:

p_6=6 divides p_10=10? 10 % 6 != 0

No issue.

Seems fine.

Wait, maybe try i=3, j=7:

p_3=7 divides p_7=3? No

No issue.

Another pair: i=5, j=9:

p_5=5 divides p_9=1? No

No issue.

Seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe consider n=16.

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]

a[::2] = [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15][::-1] = [15,13,11,9,7,5,3,1]

So a becomes [15,2,13,4,11,6,9,8,7,10,5,12,3,14,1,16]

Check pairs:

This is getting too time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the properties of the permutation.

In the code's permutation, the odd positions have numbers in descending order from the highest available, and even positions have numbers in ascending order starting from 2.

Given that, perhaps the odd positions have larger numbers, reducing the likelihood that p_i divides p_j, since p_i is larger than p_j in many cases.

Similarly, p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} would require p_{j+1} to be a multiple of p_{i+1}, which is from even positions, having smaller numbers.

Given that, it's less likely for both conditions to be true simultaneously.

But again, without a general proof, I need to look for a specific counterexample.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that for certain n, where n is a multiple of some number, there might be pairs where both conditions hold.

But after checking several cases, I haven't found such a pair yet.

Perhaps the code's approach is correct, and I should conclude that the program is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something, and there exists some n where the code's permutation fails the condition.

But since I can't find such an n, perhaps the program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to generate a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to create a permutation of numbers from 1 to n and ensure that no two pairs (p_i, p_j) and (p_{i+1}, p_{j+1}) satisfy the divisibility conditions simultaneously.
2. **Insight**: By arranging the permutation in a way that larger numbers are placed in positions where they are less likely to divide smaller numbers, we can minimize the chances of satisfying the divisibility conditions.
3. **Permutation Generation**: The code generates a permutation by reversing the elements at odd indices (0-based). This places the larger numbers at the beginning of the permutation, reducing the likelihood of divisibility issues.

### Solution Code
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The number of test cases is read from the input.
2. **Generating Permutation**:
   - For each test case, read the value of n.
   - Create a list `a` containing numbers from 1 to n.
   - Reverse the elements at odd indices (0-based) to generate the
