Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from his original rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them. The output should be "Yes" if he can get a different rectangle and "No" otherwise.

First, I need to make sure I fully understand the problem. Bob has a rectangle of size a x b. He can make one cut parallel to one of its sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles. Then, he can rearrange these two rectangles (by rotating or moving them) to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle should be different from the original one, considering that rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 (since 4x3 is not the same as 2x6 or 6x2).

On the other hand, a 2x1 rectangle can be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only be arranged back into a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

So, the task is to determine, for given a and b, whether there exists at least one way to cut and rearrange the rectangles to form a different rectangle.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:

print('NO')

elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

This function reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads a and b, and based on certain conditions, prints "NO" or "YES".

Let's analyze the conditions in the code:

1. If both a and b are odd, print 'NO'.

2. Else, if a is double of b or b is double of a, print 'NO'.

3. Otherwise, print 'YES'.

I need to verify if these conditions correctly capture the logic required by the problem description.

First, consider the case where both a and b are odd. The program says "NO". Is this correct?

If both a and b are odd, then:

- Cutting parallel to the shorter side:

- If a < b, cut parallel to a, resulting in two rectangles of size (a/2) x b. But a is odd, so a/2 is not integer, which is impossible.

- Similarly, cutting parallel to b would result in two rectangles of size a x (b/2), which again is not integer since b is odd.

- Hence, no valid cut is possible, so another rectangle cannot be formed. So, "NO" is correct in this case.

Next, consider the case where a is double of b or b is double of a.

Let's say a = 2 * b.

Then, cutting parallel to the shorter side (which is b), we can cut the rectangle into two parts of size a x b/2, which is 2b x (b/2). But b/2 may not be integer if b is odd, but earlier condition already covered both being odd, so assuming b is even here.

Then, we have two rectangles of size 2b x (b/2).

Now, can we form a different rectangle from these two?

One way is to place them side by side, forming a rectangle of size 2b x b, which is the same as the original.

Another way is to stack them, forming a rectangle of size b x b.

But, is b x b different from 2b x b?

Yes, unless b = 0, which is not possible since a and b are at least 1.

So, in this case, we can form a different rectangle, which would be b x b.

But the program says "NO" in this case. So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, if a = 2 * b, then cutting parallel to the b side, we get two rectangles of size a x (b/2), which is 2b x (b/2).

Then, arranging them differently, we can place them side by side to get a rectangle of size (2b) x b, which is the same as the original.

Or, we can stack them to get a rectangle of size b x b.

Is b x b considered different from 2b x b?

Well, unless b = 0, which is invalid, they are different rectangles.

Hence, in this case, we can form a different rectangle, so it should be "YES", but the program says "NO".

This seems like an error in the program.

Wait, maybe I misread the condition.

The condition is: elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:

print('NO')

So, if a is twice b or b is twice a, print 'NO'.

But, as per my earlier reasoning, in this case, we can form a different rectangle, so it should be 'YES'.

Hence, this seems incorrect.

Similarly, if b is double of a, say b = 2 * a.

Cutting parallel to a, we get two rectangles of size a x (b/2) = a x a.

Then, arranging them, we can form a rectangle of size a x 2a, which is the same as the original, or 2a x a, which is the same.

Alternatively, we can form a square of size a x a.

But, a x a is different from a x 2a, unless a = 0, which is invalid.

Hence, again, we can form a different rectangle, so it should be 'YES', but the program says 'NO'.

Therefore, this seems to be an error in the program.

Perhaps the condition should be reversed.

Wait, maybe the program is correct in some other aspect, but this seems wrong.

Let me think differently.

Suppose a = 2 and b = 1.

Then, a = 2, b = 1, a is twice b.

According to the program, it should print 'NO'.

But, as per the problem description, from a 2x1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed, because cutting it results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Hence, in this case, "NO" is correct.

Wait, but according to the program, if a is double b or b is double a, print 'NO'.

But in this case, a = 2 and b = 1, a is double b, so it prints 'NO', which is correct.

But earlier, I thought that if a = 2 * b, we can form a different rectangle, but that seems not to be the case, at least for a=2 and b=1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let's consider a=2 and b=1.

Cutting parallel to the a side, we get two rectangles of size (a/2) x b = 1 x 1.

Cutting parallel to the b side, we get two rectangles of size a x (b/2) = 2 x 0.5, but b=1 is odd, so b/2 is not integer, invalid.

Hence, only valid cut is into two 1x1 rectangles.

From two 1x1 rectangles, we can only form a 1x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x1 if considered up to rotation.

Hence, "NO" is correct in this case.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in this case, we can form a different rectangle, but actually, we can't because 1x1 is considered the same as 1x1, which is essentially the same rectangle up to rotation.

Wait, no, 1x1 and 2x1 are different rectangles.

But according to the problem, rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

But 1x1 rotated is still 1x1, so it's the same.

Similarly, 2x1 and 1x2 are considered the same.

Hence, in this case, from 2x1, we can only form 1x1, which is different from 2x1, so should it be "Yes"?

Wait, but the program says "No".

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me re-express it.

From a 2x1 rectangle, after cutting, we can only form a 1x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x1 rectangle.

Hence, we can obtain another rectangle, so it should be "Yes".

But the program says "No" in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example output, for input 2 1, the output is "No".

But according to my reasoning, it should be "Yes".

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just wasting his time."

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

"From the two resulting rectangles, Bob tries to form some other rectangle, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes."

In the case of a=2, b=1:

- Cutting parallel to a: two 1x1 rectangles.

- From two 1x1 rectangles, we can form a 1x1 rectangle (by placing them side by side or stacked).

- But 1x1 is different from 2x1, so it should be "Yes".

Wait, but in the example, for input 2 1, output is "No".

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking back at the note:

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

"From the two resulting rectangles, Bob tries to form some other rectangle, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes."

So, in the case of a=2, b=1:

- Cutting into two 1x1 rectangles.

- From two 1x1 rectangles, you can form a 1x1 rectangle or a 2x1 rectangle.

- But 2x1 is the same as the original.

- 1x1 is different from 2x1.

Hence, "Yes", he can obtain another rectangle.

But the program prints "No".

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the example, for input 2 1, output is "No".

But according to the problem, it should be "Yes".

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the new rectangle must be different from the original one and all its rotations.

But in this case, 1x1 is different from 2x1, so it should be "Yes".

I'm confused.

Let me consider another example.

Take a=2, b=2.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 1x2 rectangles.

- From two 1x2 rectangles, we can form a 2x2 rectangle or a 1x4 rectangle.

- 2x2 is different from the original 2x2 (since 2x2 rotated is still 2x2).

- 1x4 is different from 2x2.

Hence, "Yes", but in the example, for input 2 2, output is "Yes".

But according to the program, for a=2, b=2:

- a and b are both even.

- a/2 = 1 != 2, and b/2 =1 !=2.

- Hence, it would print 'YES', which matches the example.

Wait, but earlier for a=2, b=1, the program prints 'NO', which contradicts my reasoning that it should be 'YES'.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when a is double b or b is double a, you cannot form a different rectangle.

But in the case a=2, b=1, you can form a 1x1 rectangle, which is different from 2x1.

Hence, it should be 'Yes'.

But the program says 'No'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting the number of rectangles that can be formed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that you can only form rectangles that have area equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller rectangles.

In the case of a=2, b=1:

- Original area is 2*1=2.

- Cutting into two 1x1 rectangles, each of area 1.

- Combining them can only form a rectangle of area 2.

- Possible rectangles are 1x2 or 2x1, which are the same as the original.

- Hence, no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but I thought of forming a 1x1 rectangle, but that would require arranging both rectangles together, which wouldn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong.

From two 1x1 rectangles, you can arrange them side by side to form a 2x1 rectangle or stacked to form a 1x2 rectangle, both of which are the same as the original.

Hence, no new rectangle can be formed.

Hence, "No" is correct.

I must have misremembered.

So, in this case, the program is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that from two 1x1 rectangles, I could form a 1x1 rectangle, but that's not possible because I have two rectangles.

Wait, no, from two 1x1 rectangles, I can place them side by side to form a 2x1 rectangle or stacked to form a 1x2 rectangle, both of which are the same as the original.

Hence, no new rectangle can be formed.

Hence, "No" is correct.

I must have made a mistake earlier.

So, the program is correct in this case.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought that 1x1 is different from 2x1, but actually, from two 1x1 rectangles, I cannot form a 1x1 rectangle; I have to arrange both rectangles together to form either 2x1 or 1x2, which are the same as the original.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program is correct.

Wait, but in the problem description, it says:

"However, from the 2×1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed, because it can only be cut into two 1×1 rectangles, and from these, only the 1×2 and 2×1 rectangles can be formed, which are considered the same."

Hence, "No" is correct.

I must have misremembered this earlier.

So, the program is correct in this case.

Let me check another case.

Take a=3, b=2.

- Cutting parallel to a: two rectangles of size (a/2) x b.

- a=3, a/2=1.5, which is not integer, invalid.

- Cutting parallel to b: two rectangles of size a x (b/2).

- b=2, b/2=1, which is integer.

- So, two rectangles of size 3x1.

- From two 3x1 rectangles, we can form a 6x1 rectangle or a 3x2 rectangle.

- 6x1 is different from the original 3x2, so "Yes".

- The program would check:

- a=3, b=2.

- a%2=1, b%2=0.

- So, not both odd.

- a/2=1.5 !=2, and b/2=1 !=3.

- Hence, print 'YES', which is correct.

Another case: a=1, b=1.

- Cannot be cut into smaller rectangles with integer sides.

- Hence, "No".

- Program:

- a=1, b=1.

- Both odd.

- Hence, print 'NO', which is correct.

Another case: a=2, b=6.

- Can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles.

- From two 2x3 rectangles, can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

- Hence, "Yes".

- Program:

- a=2, b=6.

- a%2=0, b%2=0.

- a/2=1 !=6, b/2=3 !=2.

- Hence, print 'YES', which is correct.

Another case: a=6, b=3.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 3x3 rectangles.

- From two 3x3 rectangles, can form a 6x3 rectangle or a 3x6 rectangle, both same as original.

- Hence, "No".

- Program:

- a=6, b=3.

- a%2=0, b%2=1.

- a/2=3 == b.

- Hence, print 'NO', which is correct.

Wait, but according to earlier examples, a=6, b=3 should be "No", which matches the program.

Wait, but earlier I thought that a=6, b=3, cutting into two 3x3, which can only form the same rectangle, so "No", which matches the program.

Hence, program is correct in this case.

Another case: a=4, b=2.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 2x2 rectangles.

- From two 2x2 rectangles, can form a 4x2 rectangle or a 2x4 rectangle, both same as original.

- Hence, "No".

- Program:

- a=4, b=2.

- a%2=0, b%2=0.

- a/2=2 == b.

- Hence, print 'NO', which is correct.

Another case: a=4, b=4.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 2x4 rectangles.

- From two 2x4 rectangles, can form a 4x4 rectangle or a 2x8 rectangle.

- 4x4 is different from original 4x4.

- Hence, "Yes".

- Program:

- a=4, b=4.

- a%2=0, b%2=0.

- a/2=2 !=4, b/2=2 !=4.

- Hence, print 'YES', which is correct.

Another case: a=5, b=3.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 2.5x3 rectangles, invalid.

- Cutting parallel to b: two 5x1.5 rectangles, invalid.

- Hence, cannot form any new rectangle.

- Hence, "No".

- Program:

- a=5, b=3.

- a%2=1, b%2=1.

- Both odd.

- Hence, print 'NO', which is correct.

Wait, but a=5, b=3 are both odd, but in the program, if both are odd, print 'NO', which matches the expected output.

Wait, but earlier I thought that a=3, b=2 should be 'YES', and the program correctly prints 'YES'.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I thought that a=6, b=3 should be 'No', and the program prints 'No'.

Wait, but in the example, for a=6, b=3, output is 'No'.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for a=2, b=1, it should be 'Yes', but according to the problem and the example, it should be 'No'.

Hence, perhaps I was wrong in my initial reasoning.

Hence, the program seems correct.

But let me check more cases.

Take a=8, b=2.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 4x2 rectangles.

- From two 4x2 rectangles, can form an 8x2 rectangle or a 4x4 rectangle.

- 4x4 is different from 8x2.

- Hence, "Yes".

- Program:

- a=8, b=2.

- a%2=0, b%2=0.

- a/2=4 !=2, b/2=1 !=8.

- Hence, print 'YES', which is correct.

Another case: a=10, b=5.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 5x5 rectangles.

- From two 5x5 rectangles, can form a 10x5 or 5x10 rectangle, both same as original.

- Hence, "No".

- Program:

- a=10, b=5.

- a%2=0, b%2=1.

- a/2=5 == b.

- Hence, print 'NO', which is correct.

Another case: a=7, b=7.

- Cannot be cut into smaller rectangles with integer sides.

- Hence, "No".

- Program:

- a=7, b=7.

- a%2=1, b%2=1.

- Both odd.

- Hence, print 'NO', which is correct.

Wait, but a=7, b=7 can be cut into two 3.5x7 rectangles, which is invalid, so no new rectangle can be formed.

Hence, "No" is correct.

Another case: a=4, b=3.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 2x3 rectangles.

- From two 2x3 rectangles, can form a 4x3 or 3x4 rectangle, both same as original.

- Hence, "No".

- Program:

- a=4, b=3.

- a%2=0, b%2=1.

- a/2=2 !=3, b/2=1.5 !=4.

- Hence, print 'YES'.

- But according to my reasoning, it should be 'No'.

Wait, this seems incorrect.

Wait, if a=4, b=3:

- Cutting parallel to a: two 2x3 rectangles.

- From two 2x3 rectangles, can form a 4x3 (same as original) or a 3x4 (same as original).

- Hence, no new rectangle can be formed.

- Hence, it should be 'No', but the program prints 'YES'.

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the program, for a=4, b=3:

- a%2=0 and b%2=1.

- a/2=2 !=3 and b/2=1.5 !=4.

- Hence, it prints 'YES'.

But according to my reasoning, it should be 'No'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, for a=2, b=4, output is 'Yes', which matches the program.

Wait, but for a=4, b=3, program prints 'YES', but it should be 'No'.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me think again.

For a=4, b=3:

- Cutting parallel to a: two 2x3 rectangles.

- From two 2x3 rectangles, can form a 4x3 or 3x4 rectangle, both same as original.

- Is there any other way to form a different rectangle?

- For example, placing them in a different configuration.

- Maybe forming a 6x2 rectangle.

- Is that possible?

- Two 2x3 rectangles can be arranged to form a 6x2 rectangle.

- Is 6x2 different from 4x3?

- Yes, they are different rectangles.

- Hence, "Yes".

- So, the program is correct in this case.

Wait, but earlier I thought that only 4x3 and 3x4 are possible, but actually, by arranging them differently, a 6x2 rectangle can be formed, which is different from 4x3.

Hence, "Yes" is correct.

Hence, the program is correct.

I must have misremembered earlier.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Let me check another case.

Take a=9, b=3.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 4.5x3 rectangles, invalid.

- Cutting parallel to b: two 9x1.5 rectangles, invalid.

- Hence, cannot form any new rectangle.

- Hence, "No".

- Program:

- a=9, b=3.

- a%2=1, b%2=1.

- Both odd.

- Hence, print
