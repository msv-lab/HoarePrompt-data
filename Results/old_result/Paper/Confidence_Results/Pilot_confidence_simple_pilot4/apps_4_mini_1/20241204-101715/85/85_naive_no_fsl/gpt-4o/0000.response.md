To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether it accurately calculates the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Understanding Input and Output**:
   - Input: A single integer `n` representing the number of shovels.
   - Output: The number of pairs whose total cost ends with the maximum number of nines.

2. **Logic Breakdown**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of trailing nines possible from the sum of two shovels.
   - It does this by checking how many times `(n + 1)` is divisible by 10 to count the maximum nines (`max_9s`).
   - The final number of pairs is computed as `(n + 1) * max_9s`.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - Consider `n = 2`: The total cost of shovels 1 and 2 is 3, which has 0 trailing nines. The output should be 0 pairs, not 1 as the program would compute.
   - For larger values of `n`, especially values like `n = 10`, where the maximum trailing nines (1) can be achieved with pairs such as (1, 9), (2, 8)..., but the program does not logically derive the pairs correctly. 

### Testing Input Cases:
- For `n = 7`, the pairs that yield a total cost ending with 9 are: (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5). The program correctly identifies that there are 3 pairs.
- For `n = 14`, the program identifies the pairs but does so based on incorrect counting. There are actually 9 valid pairs, but the computation in the program may not reflect this appropriately in every case.
  
### Conclusion:
The program does not work correctly for certain inputs, such as `n = 2`, where it would not correctly compute the number of valid pairs leading to an output of “0”. The calculation logic fails for smaller `n` values and does not generalize well to other values either.

Correctness: **False** 

This is because the program does not handle the basic requirement of counting pairs properly for all potential inputs.
