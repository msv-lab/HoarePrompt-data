Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic necessary to determine the number of prefixes of the infinite string \( t \) with a specified balance \( x \). It adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Here's a brief breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input for multiple test cases at once, which is efficient given the constraints.

2. **Balance Calculation**: For each string \( s \), it calculates the total balance of the string by counting the occurrences of '0' and '1'. This is done using `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`.

3. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: It calculates the prefix balances of \( s \) and stores them in an array. This allows it to evaluate each prefix's balance efficiently.

4. **Infinite Balances Handling**: In case the overall balance of \( s \) is zero, it checks if the desired balance \( x \) is found among the prefix balances. If it is, it indicates that there are infinite prefixes satisfying the condition.

5. **Count Valid Prefixes**: If the balance is non-zero, it checks how many prefixes can achieve the desired balance \( x \) by ensuring that the adjustments to the prefix balance are valid according to the formula derived from the problem statement.

6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The program handles all edge cases appropriately, including when the balance is zero, and evaluates the prefix balances correctly. All potential test cases that I could conceive, including extreme cases, would yield correct results as per the description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
