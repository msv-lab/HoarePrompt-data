Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails for strings that are palindromes but have non-palindromic substrings. 

For example, consider the string "abba". The entire string is a palindrome, so the function would return 0. However, the substring "ab" and "ba" (both of length 2) are not palindromes. The correct output should be 2 since that is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring.

Thus, there are cases where the program does not return the expected output as described in the problem, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
