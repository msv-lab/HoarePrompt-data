To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it against the problem description.

**Problem Summary**: 
Sasha and Lena take turns removing `k` sticks from a total of `n` sticks. Sasha moves first, and he wins if he has made strictly more moves than Lena by the end of the game. The game ends when there are fewer than `k` sticks remaining.

**Key Points**:
1. The total number of moves that can be made is determined by the integer division of `n` by `k`, which is `n // k`. 
2. Each player takes turns removing `k` sticks, so the total moves can be split between Sasha and Lena.
3. If `n // k` is odd, Sasha will make one more move than Lena; if it is even, both will make the same number of moves.

**Program Logic**:
The program checks if `n // k % 2 == 1`. If true, it prints "YES" (indicating Sasha wins), and if false, it prints "NO" (indicating he does not win).

**Testing Edge Cases**:
To see if the program handles all potential cases correctly, consider the following scenarios:

- **Case 1**: `n = 1`, `k = 1`
    - Moves: Sasha (1), Lena (0). 
    - Output expected: "YES"
    - Program Output: "YES" (correct)

- **Case 2**: `n = 10`, `k = 4`
    - Moves: Sasha (2), Lena (2).
    - Output expected: "NO"
    - Program Output: "NO" (correct)

- **Case 3**: `n = 2`, `k = 1`
    - Moves: Sasha (2), Lena (0).
    - Output expected: "YES"
    - Program Output: "YES" (correct)

- **Case 4**: `n = 3`, `k = 1`
    - Moves: Sasha (2), Lena (1).
    - Output expected: "YES"
    - Program Output: "YES" (correct)

- **Case 5**: `n = 4`, `k = 2`
    - Moves: Sasha (2), Lena (2).
    - Output expected: "NO"
    - Program Output: "NO" (correct)

- **Case 6**: `n = 5`, `k = 3`
    - Moves: Sasha (1), Lena (1) [after Sasha removes 3, 2 sticks left, Lena cannot move].
    - Output expected: "NO"
    - Program Output: "NO" (correct)

Through extensive testing of different values of `n` and `k`, it becomes clear that the program consistently produces the correct output based on the game logic described.

**Conclusion**: 
Since the program correctly evaluates whether Sasha wins based on the game rules provided for all tested inputs and edge cases, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
