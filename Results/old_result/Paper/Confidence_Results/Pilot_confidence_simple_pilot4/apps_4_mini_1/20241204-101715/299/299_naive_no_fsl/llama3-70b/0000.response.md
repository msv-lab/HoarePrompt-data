To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the implementation step by step.

**Problem Overview:**
Sasha and Lena take turns crossing out exactly `k` sticks from a total of `n` sticks. Sasha starts first, and he wins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. The game ends when there are less than `k` sticks left.

**Key Points:**
1. Each player removes `k` sticks per turn.
2. If `n` is the total number of sticks, the maximum number of complete turns each player can take is `n // k`.
3. The total number of turns taken by both players combined would be `n // k`, which means Sasha (the first player) always gets one more move if `n // k` is odd.

**Program Explanation:**
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if (n - 1) // k > n // k:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

**Analysis of the Condition:**
- The condition `(n - 1) // k > n // k` checks if the number of moves Sasha can make is greater than the number of moves Lena can make.
- `n // k` gives the total number of complete turns possible, and `(n - 1) // k` checks if, by reducing the total sticks by one, Sasha could have made an additional turn.

**Testing Cases:**
1. **Case 1:** `n = 1, k = 1`
   - Moves: Sasha (1), Lena (0). 
   - Output: YES (correct)

2. **Case 2:** `n = 10, k = 4`
   - Moves: Sasha (2), Lena (2). 
   - Output: NO (correct)

3. **Case 3:** `n = 2, k = 1`
   - Moves: Sasha (2), Lena (0). 
   - Output: YES (correct)

4. **Case 4:** `n = 3, k = 1`
   - Moves: Sasha (2), Lena (1). 
   - Output: YES (correct)

5. **Case 5:** `n = 4, k = 2`
   - Moves: Sasha (2), Lena (2). 
   - Output: NO (correct)

Through these examples, we can confirm that the program returns the expected output. However, we need to verify the logic behind the condition. 

**Critical Insight:**
The expression `(n - 1) // k > n // k` is indeed not the right comparison to establish if Sasha has made more moves than Lena. Sasha wins when he has one more move than Lena. 

To accurately get the number of total moves:
- Total moves possible: `n // k`
- If `n // k` is odd, Sasha wins; if even, they are equal.

Thus, a correct condition would check if `(n // k) % 2 == 1`, which isn't reflected in the current implementation.

**Counterexample:**
For `n = 8` and `k = 2`:
- Expected behavior: Sasha (4), Lena (4) → Output should be "NO"
- Actual behavior with the current condition: `(8 - 1) // 2 = 3` and `8 // 2 = 4` → Output would be "YES" (incorrect).

Given that the program does not provide correct output for this case, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
