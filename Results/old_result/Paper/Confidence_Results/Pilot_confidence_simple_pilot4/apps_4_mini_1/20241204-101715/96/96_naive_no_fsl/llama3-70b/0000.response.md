To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze how it handles the definition of a unimodal array given in the problem description.

A unimodal array is defined as one that:
1. Is strictly increasing at first.
2. May have a constant block.
3. Is strictly decreasing at the end.

The sequence can also have absent strictly increasing or decreasing sections. 

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The program starts by reading an integer `n` (the size of the array) and then the array itself.
2. It initializes three boolean flags: `increasing`, `constant`, and `decreasing`.
3. The program iterates through the array starting from the second element and checks:
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, it sets `increasing` to `True`.
   - If it finds equal elements after an increasing sequence, it switches to `constant`.
   - If it encounters a smaller element after a constant or increasing sequence, it switches to `decreasing`.
4. It prints `NO` if it detects that the sequence is trying to increase after it has already started decreasing.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Only Constant Values**: An array like `[4, 4, 4, 4]` should return "YES", indicating it is unimodal.
2. **Single Element**: An array like `[1]` should return "YES".
3. **Two Elements**: For example, `[5, 5]` should return "YES" and `[5, 3]` should return "YES", while `[3, 5]` should return "NO".
4. **Transitioning Incorrectly**: An array such as `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3]` should return "NO" because it goes back to increasing after decreasing.

### Testing the Program:
Let's take the edge case of an array `[5, 5, 5, 5]`:
- The program will read the array and start processing.
- It will find all elements equal, ultimately setting it to constant.
- It will end with `print('YES')`, which is correct.

Now for the case `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3]`:
- It will correctly identify the initial increasing sequence then will go to decreasing.
- However, it will encounter the third element being greater than the last seen decreasing value, which results in `print('NO')`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
After checking various potential edge cases and analyzing the transitions, I find that the program correctly implements the unimodal check as specified in the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**
