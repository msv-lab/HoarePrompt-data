To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze how the program works step by step.

1. The program first reads an integer `k` which represents the position in the infinite sequence of concatenated positive integers.
2. It initializes variables:
   - `length` to keep track of the number of digits of the current numbers being processed (starting from 1 digit, i.e., numbers 1-9).
   - `count` to keep track of how many numbers have that number of digits (starting with 9 for the 1-digit numbers).
   - `start` is initialized to 1 which represents the first number in the current range of numbers being looked at.

3. The while loop (`while k > length * count:`) continues until `k` is less than or equal to the total number of digits contributed by the current range of numbers (1-digit, 2-digit, etc.). Inside this loop:
   - It reduces `k` by the total number of digits contributed by that range (`length * count`).
   - It increments `length` to move to the next range of numbers (from 1-digit to 2-digit, etc.).
   - It changes `count` to represent how many numbers have that new number of digits (9, 90, 900, ...).
   - It changes `start` to the first number in the new range of digits (1, 10, 100, ...).

4. Once the while loop exits, it calculates which specific number in the current range holds the k-th digit:
   - It increments `start` by the integer division of the remaining `k` by the number of digits (length).
   - It converts `start` to a string and finds the specific digit by indexing into it using the modulus of `k`.

5. Finally, it prints the digit at the appropriate index.

### Checking Edge Cases
The program appears to handle various scenarios correctly, including:
- Small values of `k` (like 1 to 9) which directly corresponds to digits of single-digit numbers.
- Values such as 10 to 189 which corresponds to the sequence of two-digit numbers.
- Larger values up to the maximum of 10000.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program and considering edge cases, it seems correct. For every valid value of `k` within the specified range (1 to 10000), the program correctly computes the k-th digit in the concatenated sequence of positive integers.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
