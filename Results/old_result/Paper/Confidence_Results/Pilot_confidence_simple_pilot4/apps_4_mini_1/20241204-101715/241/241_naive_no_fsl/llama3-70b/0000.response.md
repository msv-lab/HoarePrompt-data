To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

The program is supposed to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from the shuffled string `s` and the remembered substring `t`. 

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two strings: `s` (the shuffled digits) and `t` (the remembered substring).

2. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` initializes `n` as an empty string.
   - It creates a set `t_set` consisting of the characters from `t`.
   - It then iterates through each character in `s`. If the character is present in `t_set`, it appends the character to the string `n`.
   - After iterating through `s`, it appends `t` to `n`.
   - Finally, it converts `n` to an integer (which removes any leading zeros) and returns this integer.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The program first collects digits from `s` that are also in `t` and appends the entire substring `t` at the end.
   - The integer conversion at the end (`int(n)`) ensures that if there are leading zeros in `n`, they are removed.

### Potential Issue:
To find a case where the program might not work as expected, consider the following points:
- The program does not check whether the digits it collects from `s` can actually form a valid number `n` that, when combined with `t`, yields the smallest possible `n`.
- There might be cases where the digits of `s` collected do not represent the smallest arrangement when considering the necessary count of digits in `n`. 

### Test Case:
Let's take a test case to see if we can find an issue:
- Input:
```
s = "003512"
t = "021"
```
Expected output should be the smallest arrangement of the digits that includes `021`. 

Following the logic of the code:
- From `s`, it collects `0`, `0`, `2`, `1` (the digits in `t`).
- The program then appends `t` to this, forming `n = "00021"`, which, when converted to an integer, gives `21`.

However, the smallest number `n` considering `t` and digits of `s` should have been `30021` (using digits `3`, `0`, `2`, `1` in that order). 

### Conclusion:
The program fails to produce the smallest integer `n` in this scenario because it simply aggregates available digits without considering their arrangement that would yield the smallest possible number when combined with `t`. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
