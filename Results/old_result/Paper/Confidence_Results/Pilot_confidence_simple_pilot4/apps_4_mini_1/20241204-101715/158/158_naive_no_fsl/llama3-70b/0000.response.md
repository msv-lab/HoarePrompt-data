Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that Nikolay can use to make the compote while adhering to the required ratio of 1 lemon: 2 apples: 4 pears. 

Here's how it works:
1. The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon`) based on the available fruits and their required proportions:
   - It checks how many full sets of fruits can be made:
     - `a` gives the maximum lemons available.
     - `b // 2` gives how many lemons can be paired with apples (since each lemon requires 2 apples).
     - `c // 4` gives how many lemons can be paired with pears (since each lemon requires 4 pears).
   - The minimum of these values determines the maximum number of full sets of fruits that can be made.
3. The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`
   - This equates to `min_lemon` lemons, `2 * min_lemon` apples, and `4 * min_lemon` pears.

The output is accurate, as validated by the provided examples, and handles all edge cases, such as when there are not enough fruits to make even a single compote (resulting in a total of 0). Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
