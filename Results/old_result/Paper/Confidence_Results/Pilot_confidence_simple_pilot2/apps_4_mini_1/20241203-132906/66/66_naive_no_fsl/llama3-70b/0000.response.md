Correctness: **False**

The Python program is intended to find the minimum distance between the indices of the smallest value in an input list. However, it does not handle the case where there is only one occurrence of the minimum value in the list. In this case, the variable `min_distance` remains set to `float('inf')`, and the program would print this infinity value rather than providing a meaningful result.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
3 1 4 2 5
```

Here, the minimum value is `1`, which occurs at index `1`. Since there are no other occurrences of `1`, the program would incorrectly output `inf` instead of indicating that there is no valid distance to compute.

Thus, for this case (and similar cases), the program does not work as expected, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
