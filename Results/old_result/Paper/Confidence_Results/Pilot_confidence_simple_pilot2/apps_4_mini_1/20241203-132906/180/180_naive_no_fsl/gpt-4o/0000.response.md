Correctness: **False**

The program appears to have a logical flaw in the computation of the number of valid permutations based on the given parameters `n`, `x`, and `pos`. Specifically, it does not handle cases where the values of `pos`, `x`, and `n` create situations that violate constraints on the number of elements less than and greater than `x`.

For example, consider the input where `n = 5`, `x = 1`, and `pos = 0`. In this case:

- `less_than_x = 1 - 1 = 0`
- `greater_than_x = 5 - 1 = 4`
- `left_size = pos = 0`
- `right_size = 5 - pos - 1 = 4`

Here, `left_size` does not exceed `less_than_x`, but `right_size` (4) exceeds `greater_than_x` (4), which leads to an inconsistency. The function should return 0 because it is impossible to place 4 numbers greater than `x` to the right of `pos` when there are no valid numbers less than `x`.

Thus, the program fails to correctly handle such edge cases and as a result, does not meet the correctness criteria for all potential cases.
