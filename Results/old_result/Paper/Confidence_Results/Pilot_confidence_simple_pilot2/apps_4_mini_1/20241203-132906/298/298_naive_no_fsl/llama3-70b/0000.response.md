Correctness: **False**

The program seems to be attempting to solve a problem involving modular arithmetic or conditions related to the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), but there is no clear problem description provided to determine its correctness fully.

One potential case that illustrates the issue is when `n`, `m`, and `k` are such that `n * m` is divisible by `k`, but the conditions under which the program prints 'YES' may not cover all necessary cases. 

For example, if we take:
- `n = 1`
- `m = 1`
- `k = 1`

Here, we have:
- `1 * 1 % 1` equals `0`, so the program will not print 'NO' and proceed to calculate GCD and coefficients.
- The `func_3` will return `(1, 0, 1)` because `gcd(1, 1) = 1`. Thus, the condition `abs(n1 * m) >= g` becomes `abs(1 * 1) >= 1`, which is `True`, leading to the output of 'YES' and points `(0, 1)` and `(1, 0)`.

However, if we take:
- `n = 2`
- `m = 3`
- `k = 6`

Then `2 * 3 % 6` equals `0` and the program will check further conditions. Despite working for these values, if we consider scenarios of larger integers or when `k` is not a divisor of `n * m`, the logic behind the outputs may not hold valid without a clear specification of what the output needs to fulfill. This ambiguity and lack of comprehensive checks on edge cases can lead to an incorrect output.

Since we can derive conditions where the output 'YES' or 'NO' may not match expected results due to the lack of a clear problem description, the program cannot be deemed correct in all cases, hence the output is False for correctness.
