Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not have a clear problem description, making it difficult to ascertain its correctness regarding a specific requirement. While the logic within the `func_1` function appears to compute a value based on the input strings `s1` and `s2`, which are presumably binary strings (based on the presence of '1'), the lack of a defined problem statement leaves significant ambiguity.

Here are some potential issues with the program:

1. **Input Assumptions**: The program assumes that the input strings consist solely of '0's and '1's. If any other character is present, it would not be handled, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or errors.

2. **Output Meaning**: Without knowing what the intended output signifies or how the values derived from `func_1` should be interpreted, it's impossible to validate the correctness of the comparisons and the output ('>', '<', '=') conditionally based on those values.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not consider edge cases such as empty strings or strings containing only '0's. For instance, if both strings are empty, the program would treat them as equal, but without a clear definition, it remains uncertain if this is the expected behavior.

Due to these ambiguities and potential shortcomings, the program cannot be considered correct.
