Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine the minimum number of digits that need to be removed from a number \( n \) so that the remaining digits form a perfect square. However, it has a critical flaw in how it handles subsequences and the check for perfect squares.

### Issues:

1. **Subsequence Generation**: The code generates all possible subsequences of the number. However, it does not account for leading zeros in the subsequences. For example, if \( n = 100 \), the subsequence '00' should not be considered a valid integer, but the code would incorrectly treat it as a valid subsequence.

2. **Perfect Square Check**: The function `func_1` checks if a number is a perfect square. However, if leading zeros are not removed, it can lead to incorrect checks. For example, the subsequence '04' would be treated as a valid integer and passed to `func_1`, but '04' is not a perfect square (as '4' is, but leading zeros should be ignored).

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases effectively, such as when \( n \) is a single digit or when the input number is 0 or negative. The current implementation assumes that the input will always yield valid non-empty subsequences.

### Example Case:
Consider the input \( n = 100 \):
- The subsequences generated would include '1', '0', '0', '10', '00', '100', etc.
- The subsequence '00' leads to an integer representation of 0, which will fail the perfect square check as the code does not skip empty or invalid integer representations.

These issues indicate that the program does not correctly implement the logic as described, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
