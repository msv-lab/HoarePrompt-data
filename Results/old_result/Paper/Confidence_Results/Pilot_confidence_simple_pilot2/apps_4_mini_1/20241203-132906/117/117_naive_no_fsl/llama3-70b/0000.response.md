Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to calculate the number of minutes two intervals overlap, taking into account a specific point `k`. However, it does not handle the case when `k` is exactly equal to the start or end of the overlapping interval correctly.

Consider the following case:
- Input: `1 5 4 6 4`
- Expected Output: `2` (The overlap interval is [4, 5])
- Actual Output: `1` (The program decrements `end` by `1` because `k` is within the interval)

Thus, for this input, the program produces an incorrect output, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
