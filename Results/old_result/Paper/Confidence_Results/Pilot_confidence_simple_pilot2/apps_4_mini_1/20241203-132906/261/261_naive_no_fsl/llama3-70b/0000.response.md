Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

1. **`func_1(n)`**: This function counts the number of 1-bits (Hamming weight) in the binary representation of the integer `n`. It uses a bitwise operation to achieve this.

2. **`func_2(m, k)`**: This function seeks the smallest integer `n` such that the count of integers `i` in the range `(n + 1, 2 * n]` (exclusive of `n + 1` and inclusive of `2n`) having exactly `k` 1-bits in their binary representation is equal to `m`.

The program correctly implements the logic to find `n` based on the input parameters `m` and `k`. The use of the `while True` loop ensures that it continues searching for suitable `n` until the condition is met, and it correctly increments `n` after each iteration.

After carefully analyzing the logic and potential edge cases:
- Cases where `m` or `k` are zero are correctly handled.
- The program will stop and return as soon as it finds the correct `n`, meaning it efficiently explores all needed values.

Since I cannot find any instance where the program fails to meet the requirements based on the logic described, I conclude that the program works correctly for all input cases that fall within the expected constraints. 

Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
