Correctness: **False**

The provided program has two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. However, the problem description is missing, meaning we don't know the expected behavior of the program.

1. **func_1**:
   - This function implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, `a` and `b`. The implementation looks correct for this purpose.

2. **func_2**:
   - This function is supposed to compute the sum of modular inverses of integers from 1 to `m` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The use of `pow(i, MOD - 2, MOD)` is based on Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p\) for a prime \(p\), giving the modular inverse as \(a^{p-2} \mod p\). 

### Issues:
- The potential issue arises from the behavior of `func_2` when `m` is 0 or negative. The range for the loop `for i in range(1, m + 1)` implies that if `m` is 0, it will not iterate at all. If `m` is negative, the loop will also not execute, and `res` will remain 0. This behavior is not specified and might not meet a requirement that sums should be calculated only for positive integers.
  
- Furthermore, there is no error handling or validation for the input. If `m` is a negative number, the function essentially returns 0, which may not be the intended behavior.

Since the program doesn't handle cases of non-positive integers for `m` correctly, it can lead to incorrect results based on the unspecified problem requirements.

In conclusion, due to the handling of edge cases where `m` is 0 or negative, the program is not universally correct. Thus, the correctness of the program is labeled as **False**.
