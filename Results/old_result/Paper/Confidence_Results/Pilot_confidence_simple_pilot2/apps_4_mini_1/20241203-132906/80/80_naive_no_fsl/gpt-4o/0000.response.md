Correctness: **False**

The program appears to compute a result based on the input integer `m`, but it does not handle cases where `m` is less than 1. Specifically, if `m` is `0` or a negative number, the program would not return a valid output, as the loop in `func_2` would not execute. 

For example:
- If the input `m` is `0`, the function `func_2` will skip the loop and directly return `0`, which might not be a valid output based on typical expectations for such problems.
- If the input `m` is negative, the loop will also not run, leading to potentially undefined behavior as `length_sum` would remain `0`.

The program lacks checks for valid input ranges, resulting in incorrect behavior for edge cases. Therefore, it does not satisfy the problem description for all potential inputs.
