Correctness: **False**

The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but does not have a clear problem description to understand the intended functionality. However, upon analyzing the code, we can identify potential issues based on common usages and expectations from such functions.

1. The `func_1` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `x` and `y`. This part seems correct.

2. The `func_2` function has more complex logic involving the parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. The function attempts to reduce `m`, `a`, and `b` by their GCD, which might be correct under certain mathematical contexts, but we need to analyze it further for edge cases.

3. If `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, the function returns a triangular number based on `m`, which may not align with the expected output in all cases.

4. The key issue arises in the line:
   ```python
   sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
   ```
   Here, if `k` is greater than `m`, it could lead to a negative value for `sum_m`. This would lead to an unexpected result in the total sum being returned.

5. Additionally, since there is no problem description, we cannot ascertain if the function is expected to handle negative values, zero, or specific ranges for `m`, `a`, and `b`. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to ensure that the function works as intended across all potential input scenarios.

Due to these identified issues and the lack of a clear problem description to confirm the correctness of the logic, we conclude that the program does not work as required in all cases.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the program does not meet the correctness criteria defined by the problem description (which is absent), thus:

Correctness: **False**
