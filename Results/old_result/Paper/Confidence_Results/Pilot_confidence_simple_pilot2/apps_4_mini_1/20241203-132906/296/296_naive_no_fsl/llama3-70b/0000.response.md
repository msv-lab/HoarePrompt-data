Correctness: **False**

The program does not have a clear problem description, but we can derive that it is likely trying to check if a given integer \( n \) is equal to 2. If \( n \) is 2, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES', a constant value of 2, and two pairs of values.

The issues arise when considering other potential inputs:

1. For \( n = 1 \): The program will output 'YES', print '2', '1 0', and '1 1'. However, it does not handle this case according to typical behavior for prime checking or similar logic, as 1 is neither prime nor composite.

2. For all other values of \( n \) greater than 2: The output seems to imply some form of output related to prime or composite numbers, but it is not clear what the intended behavior is. Without a problem description, we canâ€™t definitively state what should happen.

Thus, since the program's logic isn't robust and lacks handling for crucial edge cases like \( n = 1 \), it is incorrect for at least one input.
