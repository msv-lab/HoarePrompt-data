Correctness: **False**

The program appears to be determining whether a number \( n \) has divisors (excluding 1 and itself) and is structured to return "NO" if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2 or if no divisors are found. However, there are several issues with the implementation that fail to meet the logical requirements for a typical problem related to finding divisors. 

1. **Missing Import Statement**: The program uses `math.sqrt(n)` but does not import the `math` module. This will raise a `NameError` when the function is executed.
   
2. **Incorrect Handling of Prime Numbers**: For any prime number \( n \) greater than 2, the function will return "NO" even though prime numbers do not have any divisors other than 1 and themselves. The expected behavior for inputs like 3, 5, or 7, based on typical divisor problems, is to return "NO" but the way it's coded suggests it's incorrectly structured for what seems like a problem of listing divisors.

3. **Output Format**: The function returns "YES" if divisors are found, but it does not adequately distinguish between different cases. For instance, if \( n = 4 \), the output would be "YES\n2\n1 2\n1 4", which is inconsistent with a clear understanding of what the output should represent.

4. **General Output for Divisors**: The program should ideally return divisors greater than 1 but less than \( n \). The current logic could potentially return divisors that do not comply with this requirement.

Since the code fails to handle edge cases, mismanages expected outputs for prime numbers, and lacks necessary imports, it does not satisfy the correctness criteria established by the problem description.
