Correctness: **False**

The provided program seems to attempt to find the smallest integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime, where `n` is taken from user input. However, there are several potential cases where the program may not function as intended:

1. **Negative Input**: If `n` is negative, `n * m + 1` will eventually produce negative or zero values as `m` increases. The function `func_1` is designed to return `False` for any number less than 2, including negative numbers. This means the loop will break immediately for any `m` if `n` is negative, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

2. **Zero Input**: If `n` is zero, then `n * m + 1` will always equal 1, which is not prime. The `func_1` function will return `False` immediately for this case, and the program will print `m = 1`. This behavior may not be what's expected based on a typical understanding of such problems, as the first non-prime would be trivially found.

3. **Input Range**: The loop only runs for `m` from 1 to 1000. If, for some `n`, `n * m + 1` is always prime for `m` in this range, the function will not output anything, which might not be the intended behavior.

Given these considerations, the program does not correctly handle all input cases as specified in the implied problem description that it seems to be trying to solve.
