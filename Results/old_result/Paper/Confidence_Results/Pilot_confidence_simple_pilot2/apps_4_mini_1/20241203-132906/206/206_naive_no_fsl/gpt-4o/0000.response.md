Correctness: **False**

The program is designed to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!. However, it has a critical flaw related to the handling of the base `b`. 

Consider the scenario when `b` is a prime number. The function `func_1` assumes that it can factor `b` into its prime factors, which will be just `(b, 1)` for any prime. However, if `b` is not a prime (for instance, if `b = 6`), `func_1` will return multiple prime factors (like `2` and `3` for `6`), which affects the calculation in `func_3`. 

Also, the program does not handle edge cases such as when `n = 0`. In typical mathematics, `0!` is defined to be `1`, and thus for `b` values greater than `1`, the number of trailing zeroes should be zero. But, the logic in `func_3` does not account for cases where `n` might be `0` or `b` equal to `1`, which should not be valid for a base in a numeral system.

These issues could lead to incorrect results in various scenarios, indicating that the program does not fulfill the requirements correctly for every potential case.
