Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to calculate the maximum score based on the provided logic, which appears to be summing elements to the left and right of each index. However, it does not correctly represent the problem as described because it fails to include the value at index `i` itself in the calculation of `current_score`. 

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 3
a = [1, 2, 3]
```
For `i = 1`, the left sum is `1` (sum of `[1]`), the right sum is `3` (sum of `[3]`), but it misses the value at index `1`, leading to a `current_score` of `1 + 3 = 4` instead of `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. The maximum score would be incorrectly computed as `4` instead of `6`, demonstrating that the program does not handle this case correctly.
