Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to the brackets '()', '{}', and '[]'. 

Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Stack Usage**: The program uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. This is the correct approach for checking balanced parentheses.

2. **Matching Logic**: When a closing bracket is encountered, the program checks if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If they do not match, it returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced.

3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters in the expression, the program checks if the stack is empty. An empty stack means that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, thus the expression is balanced.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles various edge cases, such as:
   - An empty string (returns `True`).
   - Strings with no brackets (returns `True`).
   - Unmatched brackets (returns `False`).
   - Nested brackets (correctly identifies them as balanced).

Given these points, the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description.
