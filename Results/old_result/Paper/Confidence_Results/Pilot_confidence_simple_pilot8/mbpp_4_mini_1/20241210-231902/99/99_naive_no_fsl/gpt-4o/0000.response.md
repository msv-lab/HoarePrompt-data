Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to remove characters from a string that have odd index values. The function `func_1` constructs a new string by including only those characters from the input string `s` whose indices are even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`). 

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases:
- For the input `'abcdef'`, the output is `'ace'`, which correctly includes characters at indices 0, 2, and 4.
- For the input `'python'`, the output is `'pto'`, which includes characters at indices 0, 2, and 4.
- For the input `'data'`, the output is `'dt'`, which includes characters at indices 0 and 2.
- For the input `'lambs'`, the output is `'lms'`, which includes characters at indices 0, 2, and 4.

Since the function correctly handles all the provided test cases and adheres to the problem description, I cannot find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
