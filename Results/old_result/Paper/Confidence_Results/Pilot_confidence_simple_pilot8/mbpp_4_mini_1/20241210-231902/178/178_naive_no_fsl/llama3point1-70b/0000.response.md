Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It rounds each number in the provided list using the built-in `round()` function, sums the rounded numbers, and then multiplies that sum by the length of the list. 

To verify, consider the following:

1. **Rounding**: The `round()` function in Python rounds a number to the nearest integer. If the number is exactly halfway between two integers, it rounds to the nearest even integer (also known as "bankers' rounding"). This behavior is consistent with typical rounding rules.

2. **Summation**: The program uses the `sum()` function to calculate the total of the rounded numbers, which is correct.

3. **Multiplication by Length**: The program multiplies the total sum by `len(numbers)`, which is the correct approach as per the problem description.

Testing with various lists:
- For an empty list `[]`, the output will be `0 * 0 = 0`, which is correct.
- For a list like `[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]`, it will round to `[2, 2, 4]`, sum to `8`, and multiply by `3` (length of the list) to give `24`.
- For a list with negative numbers, such as `[-1.5, -2.5, -3.5]`, it will round to `[-2, -2, -4]`, sum to `-8`, and multiply by `3` to give `-24`.

In all tested cases, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
