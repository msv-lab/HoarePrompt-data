Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. However, the assertion tests provided are not sufficient to verify the correctness of the implementation. 

For example, consider the case where the input sorted list is empty, like `func_1([], 3)`. The expected output should be `0` since the insertion point for any value in an empty list is `0`. However, this case is not handled in the assertions, and if such a case is tested, it would lead to an error or unexpected behavior.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
