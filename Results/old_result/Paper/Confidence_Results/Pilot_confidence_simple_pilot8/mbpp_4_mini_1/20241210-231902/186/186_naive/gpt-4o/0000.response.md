To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's first analyze the problem and the program's implementation.

**Problem Description:** 
The task is to extract the elementwise logical AND of two tuples.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))

# Test cases
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)
```

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The program uses the `zip` function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously.
2. It applies the bitwise AND (`&`) operation to each pair of corresponding elements from the two tuples.
3. The result is returned as a new tuple.

**Test Cases:**
- For the first test case, `(10 & 5, 4 & 2, 6 & 3, 9 & 3)` results in `(0, 0, 2, 1)`. This matches the expected output.
- For the second test case, `(1 & 5, 2 & 6, 3 & 7, 4 & 8)` results in `(1, 2, 3, 0)`. This matches the expected output.
- For the third test case, `(8 & 7, 9 & 13, 11 & 14, 12 & 17)` results in `(0, 9, 10, 0)`. This matches the expected output.

**Potential Missing Logic or Edge Cases:**
- The program does not handle cases where the lengths of the tuples are not the same. If `tuple1` and `tuple2` have different lengths, `zip` will truncate the longer tuple to the length of the shorter one, potentially leading to unexpected results.
- For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`, the result would be `(1 & 3, 2 & 4)` which equals `(1, 0)`, but we might expect some indication of the mismatch in lengths.

Given that the program does not handle this edge case and could lead to incorrect assumptions about the result when the tuples are of different lengths, this indicates that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
