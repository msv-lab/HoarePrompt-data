Correctness: **False**.

The problem description states that the function should extract elementwise tuples from the given two tuples. However, the program uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to combine the elements of the tuples, which is not appropriate for all types of elements that might be present in the tuples. 

For example, if the tuples contain integers, the program would work as expected. However, if the tuples contain non-integer types (like strings or lists), the program would raise a `TypeError` because the `&` operator is not defined for those types. 

Here's a specific case where the program fails:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = ('a', 'b', 'c')
func_1(tup1, tup2)
```
This would result in a `TypeError` because the program attempts to apply the bitwise AND operator to a string and an integer. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
