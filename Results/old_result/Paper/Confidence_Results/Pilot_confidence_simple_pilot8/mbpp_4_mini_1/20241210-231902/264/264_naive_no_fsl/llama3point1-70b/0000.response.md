Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`. 

The logic is sound because:
1. It uses the correct mathematical constant `math.pi` for π.
2. The multiplication and division operations are correctly applied to convert degrees to radians.

Testing the function with various inputs (e.g., `0`, `90`, `180`, `360`, and negative angles like `-90` or `-180`) would yield the expected results:
- `func_1(0)` returns `0.0`
- `func_1(90)` returns `1.5707963267948966` (which is π/2)
- `func_1(180)` returns `3.141592653589793` (which is π)
- `func_1(360)` returns `6.283185307179586` (which is 2π)
- `func_1(-90)` returns `-1.5707963267948966` (which is -π/2)

Since the function handles both positive and negative angles correctly, and all potential edge cases for degree values are accounted for, the program is correct.
