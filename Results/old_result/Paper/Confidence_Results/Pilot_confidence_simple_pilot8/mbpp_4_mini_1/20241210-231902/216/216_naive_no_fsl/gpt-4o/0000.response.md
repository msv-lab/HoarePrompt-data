Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the list contains negative numbers. For example, if we test the function with the input `[-2, -1, 0, 1]`, the expected output should be `True` because the numbers are consecutive when considering negative values. However, the program will sort the list as `[-2, -1, 0, 1]` and will return `True`, which is correct. 

But if we test the function with the input `[-2, -1, 1]`, the expected output should be `False` because the numbers are not consecutive. The program will sort the list as `[-2, -1, 1]` and will return `False`, which is correct.

However, the issue arises when we test with the input `[-1, 0, 1, 2]`, where the expected output is `True` as they are consecutive. The program will return `True`, which is correct.

The primary concern is with lists that contain duplicates or non-consecutive numbers. For example, the input `[1, 2, 2, 3]` should return `False` because the numbers are not all unique and consecutive. The program will return `False`, which is correct.

However, if we consider the input `[]`, which is an empty list, the function returns `False`, which is also correct.

In conclusion, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly and is thus deemed incorrect.
