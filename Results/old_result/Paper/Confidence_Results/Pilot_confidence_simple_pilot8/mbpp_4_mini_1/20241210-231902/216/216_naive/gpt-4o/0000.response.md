To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it based on the problem description, which is to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Empty List**: The program returns `False` for an empty list, which is reasonable because an empty list does not contain consecutive numbers.
  
2. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list first, which is necessary for checking consecutive numbers.

3. **Consecutive Check**: The loop checks if the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list is exactly `1`. If any difference is not `1`, it returns `False`. If all differences are `1`, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases:

- **Negative Numbers**: The program does not handle lists that include negative numbers. For example, `func_1([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1])` would return `False`, but if we consider consecutive numbers in the context of integers, these are indeed consecutive.

- **Non-consecutive Lists with Duplicates**: The program correctly identifies that `[1, 2, 1]` is not consecutive due to the duplicate.

- **Single Element List**: The program will return `True` for a single element list, which is incorrect as a single number cannot be considered consecutive.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle cases with negative numbers and single element lists. Therefore, it does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
