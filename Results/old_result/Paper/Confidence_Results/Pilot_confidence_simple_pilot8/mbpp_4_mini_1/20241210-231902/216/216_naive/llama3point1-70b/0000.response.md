Correctness: **False**.

The function is intended to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. However, it fails in certain situations. 

For example, consider the input list `[1, 2, 4]`. The sorted version of this list is `[1, 2, 4]`, and the differences between consecutive elements are `1` (between 1 and 2) and `2` (between 2 and 4). The function will return `False` because not all consecutive differences are `1`, but it incorrectly identifies that there are no consecutive numbers since `4` breaks the sequence.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the list contains negative numbers or zero. For instance, the input `[-2, -1, 0, 1]` should return `True` as it contains consecutive numbers, but the current implementation may not properly check for consecutive sequences that include negative numbers.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and scenarios, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
