Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. It iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` immediately if it finds any item that does not match the `element`. If it completes the loop without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`. 

The provided assertions also cover various cases:
1. A list with different strings compared to the element 'blue' returns `False`.
2. A list of integers compared to the element `7` also returns `False`.
3. A list where all elements are the same as the element 'green' returns `True`.

Since the function behaves correctly for all tested cases and logically adheres to the problem description, I conclude that it is correct for all potential inputs.
