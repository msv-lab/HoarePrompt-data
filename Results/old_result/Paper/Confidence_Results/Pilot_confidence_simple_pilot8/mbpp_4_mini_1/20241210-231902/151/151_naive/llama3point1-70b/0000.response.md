Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure. It correctly checks each element in the input list. If an element is itself a list, it recursively calls `func_1` to flatten it further, and then extends the `flat_list` with the results. If an element is not a list, it appends that element directly to `flat_list`. 

This implementation will handle all cases of nested lists, including:
- Empty lists
- Lists containing other lists of varying depths
- Lists containing non-list elements (e.g., integers, strings, etc.)

Since the function correctly processes all potential cases of nested lists and produces the expected flat list, I conclude that the program is correct.
