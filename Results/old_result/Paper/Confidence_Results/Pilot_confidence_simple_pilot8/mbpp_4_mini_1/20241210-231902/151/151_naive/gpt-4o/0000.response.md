Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It uses recursion to handle lists within lists, and the provided assertions confirm that it works for various cases of nested lists. The function checks if each item is a list; if so, it recursively flattens it, and if not, it appends the item to the flat list. The code handles all provided test cases correctly and should work for any nested list structure, including empty lists or lists with varying depths of nesting.
