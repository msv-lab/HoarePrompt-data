Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate through the list and checks if each element is an instance of `int`. The assertions provided in the program also cover various cases, including lists with mixed types, and they all return the expected results. 

1. For the input `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`, it correctly identifies `1` and `2` as integers, returning `2`.
2. For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, it counts all three elements as integers, returning `3`.
3. For the input `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]`, it identifies `1` and `4` as integers, returning `2`.

The function handles all potential edge cases correctly, including lists with no integers, lists with only non-integer types, and lists with mixed types. Thus, the program is correct.
