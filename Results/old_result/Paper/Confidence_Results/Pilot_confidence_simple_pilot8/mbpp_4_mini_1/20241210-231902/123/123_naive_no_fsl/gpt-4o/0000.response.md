To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and consider various potential cases.

The problem description states that the function should take a list and an integer `L`, and split the list into two parts: the first part should have length `L`, and the second part should contain the remainder of the list.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. The function uses slicing to create two parts:
   - The first part is `lst[:L]`, which takes the first `L` elements from the list.
   - The second part is `lst[L:]`, which takes the elements from index `L` to the end of the list.

### Consideration of Edge Cases:
1. **Case when `L` is greater than the length of the list**: 
   - For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the expected output would be `([1, 2, 3], [])` because there are not enough elements to fulfill the length `L`.
   - The actual output will be `([1, 2, 3], [])`, which is correct.

2. **Case when `L` is negative**: 
   - If we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], -1)`, the expected behavior is not defined in the problem description. However, Python will return `([], [1, 2, 3])` because slicing with a negative index starts from the end of the list.
   - This behavior might be unexpected based on the problem description.

3. **Case when `L` is zero**: 
   - If we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)`, we expect the output to be `([], [1, 2, 3])`, which is correct.

4. **Empty list case**: 
   - If we call `func_1([], 0)`, we expect the output to be `([], [])`, which is correct.
   - If we call `func_1([], 1)`, we expect `([], [])` as well, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The function behaves correctly for the specified cases and returns expected results for edge cases. However, the behavior when `L` is negative is not explicitly defined in the problem description, and it could lead to unexpected results depending on the user's expectations.

Since there is at least one case (`L` being negative) where the output may not align with typical expectations based on the problem description, we conclude that the program does not meet the requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
