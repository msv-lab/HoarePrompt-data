To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and return a tuple of length N where the i-th element is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Type**: The function accepts a tuple of numbers. This is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Output Type**: The function returns a tuple of products. The expected output length is N, which is the length of the input tuple minus one (since we are multiplying pairs).
3. **Logic**:
   - The `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` pairs each element with its next neighbor.
   - The generator expression `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` computes the product for each of these pairs.
   - The result is converted into a tuple.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Tuple**: If the input is an empty tuple `()`, the output should also be an empty tuple `()`. The function handles this correctly by returning an empty tuple.
- **Single Element Tuple**: If the input is a tuple with a single element `(5,)`, the output should also be an empty tuple `()`, which is also handled correctly.
- **Two Elements**: For input `(2, 3)`, the output should be `(6,)`, which the function correctly computes.
- **Negative and Zero Values**: The function should work correctly with negative and zero values as well. For input `(0, 5, -3)`, the output should be `(0, -15)`.

### Conclusion:
The implementation correctly follows the problem description for all potential edge cases. The function handles empty tuples, single-element tuples, and tuples with various numerical values correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
