To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to assess whether it fulfills the requirements stated in the problem description, which is to compute the average of each position across a tuple of tuples.

The program defines the function `func_1`, which appears to iterate through each index of the tuples and computes the average of the elements at that index. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The function assumes that all tuples within the input tuple have the same length. If they do not, it will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that does not exist in one of the tuples.

2. **Average Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the average for each position by summing the elements at that position and dividing by the number of tuples.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as:
   - What if the input is an empty tuple of tuples? This would lead to an `IndexError` when trying to access `tuples[0]`.
   - What if there are tuples of different lengths? This would also lead to an `IndexError`.

Given these considerations, the program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails when the input is empty or when the tuples are of different lengths.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not work correctly for cases such as `func_1(())` (an empty tuple) or `func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))` (tuples of different lengths).
