Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input tuple of tuples is empty. If `tuples` is empty, attempting to access `tuples[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. This means the function will not return a valid result for such an input, violating the problem description that requires it to compute averages for all positions in the tuples. 

For example, calling `func_1(())` would lead to an error, which indicates that the program is not robust and does not work for all potential cases as required by the problem description.
