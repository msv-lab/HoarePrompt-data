Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(nums)` correctly uses Python's built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in a list of numbers. It handles various cases, including:

1. **Empty List**: The `min()` function will raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty. However, since the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, this behavior can be considered acceptable given the lack of requirements regarding this edge case.

2. **Single Element List**: The function will correctly return that single element as the smallest number.

3. **Multiple Elements**: The function will accurately return the smallest number from a list containing multiple numbers.

Since the function behaves correctly for the specified task of finding the smallest number in a list, it can be considered correct as per the problem description.
