To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1` and the requirements for a number to be considered undulating.

### Problem Description
A number is undulating if:
1. It has at least 3 digits.
2. The first and second digits must be different.
3. The digits at even indices (0-based) must match the first digit.
4. The digits at odd indices must match the second digit.

### Program Analysis
The function `func_1` checks these conditions as follows:
1. It converts the number `n` into a string `s`.
2. It checks if the length of `s` is less than 3, returning `False` if it is.
3. It checks if the first digit is the same as the second digit, returning `False` if they are equal.
4. It iterates through the string starting from the third character (index 2) and checks:
   - If the index is even, it should match the first digit.
   - If the index is odd, it should match the second digit.
5. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns `True`.

### Test Cases Provided
1. `func_1(1212121)` should return `True` (correct).
2. `func_1(1991)` should return `False` (correct).
3. `func_1(121)` should return `True` (correct).

### Edge Cases
Now let's consider potential edge cases that may not be handled correctly:
- A number with less than 3 digits should return `False`. This is handled correctly.
- A number with repeating digits such as `111`, which should return `False` since the first and second digits are the same.
- A number like `123` should return `True`, as it alternates correctly.
- A number like `121` should return `True`, as it alternates correctly.
- A number like `1212` should return `False` because the last digit does not alternate correctly with the second digit.

### Additional Test Case
Let's test a case that could potentially fail:
- For the input `1221`, it should return `False` because the first and second digits are the same (1 and 2).

### Conclusion
The function appears to handle the stated conditions properly, but it fails for the case of `1221`, which is not explicitly tested in the assertions provided. 

Thus, since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.
