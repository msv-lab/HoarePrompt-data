To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it correctly identifies undulating numbers according to the problem description.

An undulating number is defined as one where the digits alternate between two different digits. The function checks the following:

1. If the length of the number (converted to string) is less than 3, it returns `False`.
2. It checks if the first two digits are the same; if they are, it returns `False`.
3. It then iterates through the digits starting from the third digit, verifying that even-indexed digits match the first digit and odd-indexed digits match the second digit.

Let's analyze some potential edge cases and validate the logic:

- For the input `1212121`, the output is `True`. This is correct as it alternates between `1` and `2`.
- For the input `1991`, the output is `False`. This is correct as it does not alternate properly.
- For the input `121`, the output is `True`. This is correct as it alternates between `1` and `2`.

Now let's consider additional test cases:

1. Input: `111` - The expected output is `False` because all digits are the same.
2. Input: `123` - The expected output is `False` because it does not alternate between two digits.
3. Input: `12121` - The expected output is `True` because it alternates between `1` and `2`.
4. Input: `12321` - The expected output is `False` because it does not alternate between only two different digits.
5. Input: `12121212` - The expected output is `True` because it alternates between `1` and `2`.

Considering the edge case of three identical digits, such as `111`, the function would return `False`, which is correct. However, the function does not account for numbers that have more than two different digits, such as `1234`, which should also return `False`.

Given this analysis, I found that the program does not correctly handle cases where there are more than two different digits. The function should explicitly check for this scenario to ensure it only identifies numbers that strictly alternate between two different digits.

Correctness: **False**
