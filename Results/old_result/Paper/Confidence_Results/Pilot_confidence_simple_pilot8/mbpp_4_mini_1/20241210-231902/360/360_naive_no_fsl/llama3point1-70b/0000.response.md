Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly identifies and returns the sublist from a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The use of the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument ensures that the function evaluates each sublist based on the sum of its elements.

Consider the following scenarios:

1. **Single List**: If the input is `[[1, 2, 3]]`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.
2. **Multiple Lists with Different Sums**: For input `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`, the output will be `[3, 4]`, which has the highest sum (7).
3. **Lists with Equal Sums**: If the input is `[[1, 2], [2, 1]]`, both sublists have the same sum (3). The `max` function will return the first one it encounters, which is acceptable behavior as the problem does not specify which to choose in case of ties.
4. **Empty Lists**: For the input `[[], [1, 2, 3]]`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct as it has the highest sum (6).

The program handles all these cases appropriately, and no edge cases are overlooked. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct as it meets the problem requirements for all potential inputs.
