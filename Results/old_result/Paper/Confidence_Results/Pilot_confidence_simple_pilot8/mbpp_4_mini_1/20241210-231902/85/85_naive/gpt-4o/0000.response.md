Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It does this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and calculating their difference. 

The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function works for the given test cases:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

The function handles various cases, including when there are only two elements, and it will always return a non-negative difference since it calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description.
