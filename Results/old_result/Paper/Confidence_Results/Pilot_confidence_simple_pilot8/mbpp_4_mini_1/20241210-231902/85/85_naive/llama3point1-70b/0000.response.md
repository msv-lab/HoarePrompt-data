Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(arr)` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value of the array. This approach works for all potential cases:

1. If the array is empty, the program will raise a `ValueError` when calling `max()` or `min()`, which is an edge case that should be handled.
2. If the array contains only one element, the difference will be zero, which is correct since the maximum and minimum will be the same.
3. For arrays with multiple elements, it correctly identifies the maximum and minimum values and calculates their difference.

However, the function does not handle the case of an empty array, which could lead to an unhandled exception. Therefore, while the logic is correct for non-empty arrays, the function is not robust and does not meet the problem description requirements for all potential cases. 

Thus, the correct answer is:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case of an empty array, which would cause it to fail.
