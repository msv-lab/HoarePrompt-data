Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi). 

1. **Calculation of r**: The variable `r` is calculated using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which computes the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y). This is the correct formula for the radius in polar coordinates.

2. **Calculation of phi**: The variable `phi` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). This function correctly handles all quadrants and edge cases, such as when x is zero.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple (r, phi), which is the expected output format for polar coordinates.

The function handles all potential cases, including points located on the axes, the origin, and in all quadrants of the Cartesian plane. Thus, there are no cases where the program fails to meet the problem description.
