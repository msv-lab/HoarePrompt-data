Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. 

For example, consider the input string `func_1('helloWORLD')`. The expected output should be `WORLD`, as all lowercase characters should be removed. However, the program will return `WORL` because it does not handle the case of lowercase letters correctly; it only returns uppercase letters.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem description for this input case, demonstrating that it is incorrect.
