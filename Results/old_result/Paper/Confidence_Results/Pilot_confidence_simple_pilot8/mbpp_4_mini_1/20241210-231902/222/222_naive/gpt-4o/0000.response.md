Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` is designed to remove all lowercase substrings from a given string by filtering out characters that are not uppercase. The provided assertions test this functionality with various strings, and all of them return the expected results:

1. `func_1('PYTHon')` returns `'PYTH'`, which correctly removes the lowercase substring `'on'`.
2. `func_1('FInD')` returns `'FID'`, which correctly removes the lowercase substring `'n'`.
3. `func_1('STRinG')` returns `'STRG'`, which correctly removes the lowercase substring `'in'`.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description. The function accurately meets the requirements outlined, which is to remove all lowercase letters from the input string. Thus, the program is correct.
