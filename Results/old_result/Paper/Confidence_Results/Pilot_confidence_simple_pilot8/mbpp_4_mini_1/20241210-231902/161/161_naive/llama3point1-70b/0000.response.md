Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly computes the n-th Lucas number according to the problem description. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The program handles the base cases for n = 0 and n = 1 correctly. For n greater than 1, it uses an iterative approach to calculate the subsequent Lucas numbers, ensuring that all cases are covered. 

No edge cases or potential inputs have been identified where the program would fail to produce the correct output based on the definition of Lucas numbers. Thus, the implementation is correct for all valid inputs.
