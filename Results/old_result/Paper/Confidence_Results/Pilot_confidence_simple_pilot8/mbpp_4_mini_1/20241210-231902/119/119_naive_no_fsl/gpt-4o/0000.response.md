Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number (`b`) first and the first number (`a`) second. 

The assertions provided in the program verify that the function behaves as expected for a few test cases:
- For inputs `(10, 20)`, it correctly returns `(20, 10)`.
- For inputs `(15, 17)`, it correctly returns `(17, 15)`.
- For inputs `(100, 200)`, it correctly returns `(200, 100)`.

Since the function has been tested with multiple cases and consistently produces the correct output as per the problem description, there are no potential edge cases or missing logic identified that would cause it to fail. Thus, the program is correct.
