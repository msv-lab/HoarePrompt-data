Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two input numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number first and the first number second, i.e., `(b, a)`. 

This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem statement, which specifies that the output should be a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. 

To verify correctness, we can consider various input cases:

1. For inputs `1` and `2`, the function returns `(2, 1)`, which is correct.
2. For inputs `-1` and `-2`, the function returns `(-2, -1)`, which is also correct.
3. For inputs `0` and `5`, the function returns `(5, 0)`, which is correct as well.

Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and adheres to the problem description, we conclude that the function is correct for all potential inputs.
