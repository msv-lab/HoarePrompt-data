Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list by following these steps:

1. It converts the list `nums` into a set to remove duplicates, ensuring that only unique numbers are considered.
2. It checks if there are at least two unique numbers; if not, it returns `None`.
3. It sorts the unique numbers and returns the second element, which corresponds to the second smallest number.

The program handles edge cases such as:
- If the input list has fewer than two unique numbers, it correctly returns `None`.
- It correctly identifies the second smallest number when there are at least two unique numbers in the list.

Overall, the logic is sound and all potential cases seem to be covered.
