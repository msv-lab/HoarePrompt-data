Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list of numbers. Here's the breakdown of how it works:

1. It converts the input list `nums` into a set to remove any duplicate values, ensuring that only unique numbers are considered.
2. If the number of unique elements is less than 2, it returns `None`, which is appropriate since there can't be a second smallest number in such cases.
3. It sorts the unique numbers and returns the second element (index 1), which is the second smallest number.

The program handles several cases correctly:
- If the input list has fewer than two unique numbers, it returns `None`, which aligns with the requirement.
- For a list with two or more unique numbers, it correctly identifies the second smallest.

For example:
- Input: `[3, 1, 2, 1]` → Unique numbers are `[1, 2, 3]` → Second smallest is `2`.
- Input: `[5, 5, 5]` → Unique numbers are `[5]` → Returns `None`, which is correct.

Since I cannot find any case where the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
