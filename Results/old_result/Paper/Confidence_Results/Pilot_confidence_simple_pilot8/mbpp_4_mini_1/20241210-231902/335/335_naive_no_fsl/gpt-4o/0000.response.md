To verify the correctness of the program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and the provided test cases.

### Problem Description:
The function should find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string and return `None` if there is no match.

### Analyzing the Program:
The function `func_1` uses the `find` method of strings to locate the starting position of the substring. If the substring is found, it calculates the end position and returns a tuple containing the substring, the start position, and the end position. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

### Test Cases:
1. `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python')` returns `('python', 0, 6)`. This is correct as 'python' starts at index 0 and ends at index 6.
2. `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming')` returns `('programming', 7, 18)`. This is correct as 'programming' starts at index 7 and ends at index 18.
3. `func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language')` returns `('language', 31, 39)`. This is correct as 'language' starts at index 31 and ends at index 39.
4. `func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python')` returns `None`. This is correct as 'python' is not present in the string.

### Edge Cases:
Now, we need to consider edge cases that might not be covered by the given test cases:

- What if the substring is an empty string? The current implementation does not handle this case. According to Python's string behavior, an empty string is found at every position in the main string, which could lead to unexpected results.
- What if the main string is empty? The function should return `None` for any non-empty substring since there can be no matches.

### Conclusion:
The function does not cover the case of an empty substring or an empty main string, which leads to potential incorrect behavior. Therefore, the function is not correct as it does not meet the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
