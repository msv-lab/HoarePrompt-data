To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its functionality against the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the occurrence and position of substrings within a string. The function should return `None` if there is no match.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)
```

1. **Finding the Substring**: The program uses `string.find(substring)` to locate the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. If the substring is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the program correctly returns `None`.
   
2. **Calculating Positions**: If the substring is found, the program calculates the start and end positions correctly. It returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting index, and its ending index.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty String and Substring**: If both `string` and `substring` are empty, the function will return `('', 0, -1)`, which is not `None`, but could be considered an unexpected behavior since it does not indicate a "no match" scenario clearly.
- **Substring Not Present**: If `substring` is not present in `string`, the function returns `None`, which is correct.
- **Multiple Occurrences**: The function only finds the first occurrence of the substring. If the requirement is to find all occurrences and their positions, this implementation would be incorrect.
- **Case Sensitivity**: The function is case-sensitive. If the substring is in a different case than the string, it will not find a match.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where both the string and substring are empty correctly, as it returns a tuple instead of `None`. Additionally, it does not find multiple occurrences, which may be a requirement depending on the interpretation of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
