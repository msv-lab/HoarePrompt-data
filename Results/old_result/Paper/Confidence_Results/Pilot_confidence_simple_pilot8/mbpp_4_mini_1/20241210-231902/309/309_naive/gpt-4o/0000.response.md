Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same. 

1. If the input string is empty (`not s`), it returns `True`, which aligns with the interpretation that an empty string can be considered as having all the same characters (since there are no characters to compare).
2. It stores the first character of the string and iterates through all characters in the string. If it finds any character that does not match the first character, it returns `False`.
3. If it completes the loop without finding any differing characters, it returns `True`.

The assertions provided also demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for the given test cases. 

- For 'python', it returns `False` (not all characters are the same).
- For 'aaa', it returns `True` (all characters are the same).
- For 'data', it returns `False` (not all characters are the same).

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly as per the problem description, it is correct.
