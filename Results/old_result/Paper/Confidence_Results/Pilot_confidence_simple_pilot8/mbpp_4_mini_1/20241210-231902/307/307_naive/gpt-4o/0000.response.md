To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and ensure it meets the requirement of finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Understanding Triangular Numbers**:
   - The `k`-th triangular number is given by the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).
   - The program is supposed to find the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function initializes `k` to 1 and enters an infinite loop.
   - It calculates the triangular number using the formula and checks if the number of digits (using `len(str(triangular_number))`) equals `n`.
   - If it finds such a triangular number, it returns the index `k`.

3. **Testing the Given Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided are:
     - `func_1(2) == 4`: The 4th triangular number is 10, which has 2 digits.
     - `func_1(3) == 14`: The 14th triangular number is 105, which has 3 digits.
     - `func_1(4) == 45`: The 45th triangular number is 1035, which has 4 digits.

### Potential Edge Cases

Now, we need to check if there are any potential cases where the program might fail to meet the requirements:

- **Case for n = 1**: 
   - The smallest triangular number is 1 (which is the 1st triangular number).
   - The function should return 1 for `func_1(1)` but does not have an assertion for this case.

- **Case for n = 5**: 
   - The smallest triangular number with 5 digits is 10010, which is the 141st triangular number.
   - The function should return 141 for `func_1(5)` but does not have an assertion for this case.

### Conclusion

The program does not handle the case for `n = 1` correctly, as there is no assertion or test for it. Also, it does not have assertions for larger values of `n` to verify the correctness across all potential cases.

Therefore, because the program does not correctly address the problem description for at least one input, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
