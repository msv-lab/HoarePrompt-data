To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

The function is meant to check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that contains 30 days. The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

The implementation of the function is as follows:

```python
def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
```

The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` to check if the input `month` is one of the months with 30 days. 

Now, let's analyze the assertions provided:

1. `assert func_1(6) == True` - June has 30 days, so this is correct.
2. `assert func_1(2) == False` - February typically has 28 or 29 days, so this is also correct.
3. `assert func_1(12) == False` - December has 31 days, so this is also correct.

Next, we need to consider other months (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11) to ensure that the function behaves correctly for all months from 1 to 12:

- For January (1), the function should return `False` (it has 31 days).
- For March (3), the function should return `False` (it has 31 days).
- For May (5), the function should return `False` (it has 31 days).
- For July (7), the function should return `False` (it has 31 days).
- For August (8), the function should return `False` (it has 31 days).
- For October (10), the function should return `False` (it has 31 days).
- For November (11), the function should return `True` (it has 30 days).

The function does not explicitly handle the months that are not in the set, but since it checks if the month is in the set, it will return `False` for all months that are not in `{4, 6, 9, 11}`. 

However, the function does not handle invalid month numbers (e.g., 0 or 13) that are outside the range of 1 to 12. For these cases, the function would still return `False`, which is not necessarily correct according to the problem description since it doesn't specify behavior for invalid inputs.

Thus, the function fails to meet the problem description because it does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly invalid month inputs.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not handle invalid month numbers (like 0 or 13), which could lead to incorrect results.
