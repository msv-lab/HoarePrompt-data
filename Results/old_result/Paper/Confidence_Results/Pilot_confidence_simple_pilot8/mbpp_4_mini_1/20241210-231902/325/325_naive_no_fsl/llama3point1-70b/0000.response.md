Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input is a month number that does not exist (e.g., 0 or 13). According to the problem description, the months are to be given as numbers from 1 to 12. The function should return a clear indication (e.g., `False`) for any input outside this range. 

For example:
- If the input is `0`, the function will return `False`, but `0` is not a valid month number.
- If the input is `13`, the function will also return `False`, but again, `13` is not a valid month number.

The function should ideally handle invalid inputs and not just check for the months with 30 days. Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not account for all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
