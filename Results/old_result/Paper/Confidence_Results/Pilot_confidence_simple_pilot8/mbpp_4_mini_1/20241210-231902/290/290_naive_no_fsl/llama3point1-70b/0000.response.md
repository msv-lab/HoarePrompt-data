Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement of checking if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. 

Consider the following test case: 

- Input: `"zebra"`
- Expected Output: `False` (since 'z' is at the start)
- Actual Output: `True` (the function incorrectly identifies 'z' in the word)

Another test case:

- Input: `"az"`
- Expected Output: `False` (since 'z' is at the end)
- Actual Output: `False` (this one works, but it shows inconsistency)

The program fails to handle cases where 'z' is at the start or end of a word correctly, thus it does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
