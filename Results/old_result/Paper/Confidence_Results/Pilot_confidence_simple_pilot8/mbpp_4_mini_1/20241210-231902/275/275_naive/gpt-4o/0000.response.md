To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1` and see if it correctly identifies the size of the largest subset of numbers such that every pair is divisible.

### Problem description:
The function should find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list first, which is beneficial because if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` and `i > j`, then `nums[i]` must be greater than or equal to `nums[j]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array is initialized to 1, assuming each number is a subset of itself. The nested loops iterate through each combination of pairs to check divisibility.

3. **Divisibility Check**: The condition `if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` checks if the current number can be included in the subset formed by previous numbers.

4. **Returning the Result**: Finally, it returns the maximum value found in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Now, let's consider edge cases and potential failures:
- **Single Element**: For a single element list, e.g., `[5]`, the expected output should be `1` since the only number is a subset of itself. The function handles this correctly.
- **All Elements Divisible by Each Other**: For an input like `[2, 4, 8, 16]`, the largest subset should include all elements, and thus the output should be `4`, which the function correctly calculates.
- **No Elements Divisible**: For an input like `[3, 5, 7]`, the largest subset should be `1`, and the function also handles this correctly.
- **Empty List**: The function returns `0` for an empty list, which is correct.

### Potential Failure Case:
However, if we take an input like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`, the expected largest subset would be `[1, 2, 4]` (size `3`) because:
- `1` is divisible by all,
- `2` is divisible by `4`, 
- `4` is not divisible by `3` or `6`.

The function would incorrectly include `3` and `6` in the calculations which do not belong to the same subset. The function does not account for the fact that the largest subset should only include numbers that can form a pairwise divisible relationship.

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when there are mixed numbers that cannot all be included in the same divisible subset, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**.
