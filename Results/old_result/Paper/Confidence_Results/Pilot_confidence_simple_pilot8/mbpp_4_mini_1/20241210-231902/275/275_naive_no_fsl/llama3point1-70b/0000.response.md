Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible by each other. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Check**: It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns `0`, which is correct since there are no numbers to form a subset.

2. **Sorting**: The list is sorted. This is important because it allows the program to check divisibility in a structured manner, ensuring that when checking `nums[i] % nums[j]`, `nums[j]` is always less than or equal to `nums[i]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The program uses a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`. It initializes each element of `dp` to `1` because each number can at least form a subset of size `1` by itself.

4. **Nested Loop**: The nested loops iterate over the sorted list. For each number `nums[i]`, it checks all previous numbers `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) to see if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`.

5. **Final Result**: Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset found.

The program correctly handles various cases, including:
- An empty list (returns `0`).
- Lists with all numbers being `1` (returns the length of the list).
- Lists with prime numbers (returns `1` since no two distinct primes are divisible by each other).
- Lists with multiples (correctly calculates the size of the largest subset).

Since I could not find any example where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Thus, the final output is:
Correctness: **True**
