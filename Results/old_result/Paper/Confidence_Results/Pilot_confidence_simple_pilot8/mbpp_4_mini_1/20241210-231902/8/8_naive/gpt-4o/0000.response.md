To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem description:
The task is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]

# Test cases
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'
```

### Analysis:
1. **Finding Indices**:
   - The program uses `s.find(ch)` to find the first occurrence of the character `ch`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(ch)` to find the last occurrence of the character `ch`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `first_index` or `last_index` is `-1`, it indicates that the character `ch` is not found in the string. In this case, the function returns the original string.
   - If `first_index` equals `last_index`, it means there is only one occurrence of the character in the string. The function also returns the original string in this case.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - If there are at least two occurrences of `ch`, the function constructs a new string by excluding the first and last occurrences of `ch`.

### Potential Case:
Let's consider a test case that is not covered by the provided assertions:
- Input: `func_1('a', 'a')` should return `''` (an empty string) because both the first and last occurrences of 'a' should be removed.
- Input: `func_1('aa', 'a')` should return `''` as well, since both occurrences should be removed.
- Input: `func_1('abc', 'd')` should return `'abc'` since 'd' does not exist in the string.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle cases where the string consists of the character `ch` entirely (like `'a'` or `'aa'`). It should return an empty string in such cases, but it currently returns the original string. Therefore, the function is incorrect for these scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
