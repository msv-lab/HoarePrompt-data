Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array and an element as inputs and checks if the element is present in the array. 

Here's how it works:

1. It uses the `index()` method of the list, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`.
2. If the element is not found, a `ValueError` is raised, which is caught by the `except` block, returning the tuple `(False, -1)`.

This implementation correctly handles all potential cases:
- If the element is present in the array, it returns `True` and the correct index.
- If the element is not present, it returns `False` and `-1`.

There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail to meet the problem requirements. Thus, the function behaves as expected for all scenarios described in the problem statement.
