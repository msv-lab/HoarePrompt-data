Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array, along with the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element.
2. If the current value matches the element being searched for, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`.
3. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works correctly for those specific cases. Additionally, the function handles the following scenarios correctly:
- If the element is the first element in the array, it will return `(True, 0)`.
- If the element is the last element in the array, it will return `(True, index of last element)`.
- If the element is not present in the array, it will return `(False, -1)`.

Since I cannot think of any potential cases where the function would not work as described, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
