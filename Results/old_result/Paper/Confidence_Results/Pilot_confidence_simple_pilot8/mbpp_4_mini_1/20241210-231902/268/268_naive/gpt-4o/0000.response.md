To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

**Problem Description**: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n-th column.

**Program**:
```python
assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11

def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
```

**Analysis**:
1. The function `func_1` takes a matrix (list of lists) and an integer `n` representing the column index.
2. It constructs a list `nth_column` containing the elements of the n-th column from each row of the matrix.
3. It returns the maximum value from this list.

**Potential Cases**:
- If `n` is out of bounds (i.e., greater than or equal to the number of columns in any of the rows), the code will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access `row[n]`. This situation is not handled in the code.
- If the matrix is empty or contains empty rows, the program will also fail when trying to access elements.

**Example of Failure**:
- Consider the input `func_1([], 0)` (an empty matrix). This will raise an `IndexError` because there are no rows to access.
- If we have a matrix `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and we call `func_1(matrix, 2)`, it will also raise an `IndexError` because there is no third column.

Since the program does not handle these potential edge cases, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
