To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1(matrix, n)`.

### Problem Description:
The function should return the maximum value from the `n`-th column of a matrix represented as a list of lists.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Indexing**: The function assumes that `n` is 1-based (as indicated by `n - 1`), meaning that if `n` is 1, it accesses the first column. However, if `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in any row, it will raise an `IndexError`.

2. **Empty Matrix**: If the input `matrix` is empty, `max()` will raise a `ValueError` because there are no values to evaluate.

3. **Inconsistent Row Lengths**: If the rows of the matrix have different lengths, accessing `row[n - 1]` could also lead to an `IndexError` if a particular row has fewer columns than `n`.

### Example Cases:
1. **Empty Matrix**:
   ```python
   print(func_1([], 1))  # Should raise an error, but the function does not handle this case.
   ```

2. **Invalid Column Index**:
   ```python
   matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
   print(func_1(matrix, 3))  # Should raise an error, but the function does not handle this case.
   ```

3. **Inconsistent Row Lengths**:
   ```python
   matrix = [[1, 2], [3]]
   print(func_1(matrix, 2))  # Should raise an error, but the function does not handle this case.
   ```

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle edge cases such as an empty matrix, invalid column indices, or inconsistent row lengths, which can lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
