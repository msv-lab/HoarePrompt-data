Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and subtracts the elements of `tup2` from `tup1` at the same indices using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor. 

The use of `zip(tup1, tup2)` ensures that the elements are paired correctly based on their indices, and the subtraction operation is applied element-wise. The program will handle tuples of equal lengths correctly and will raise a `ValueError` if the tuples are of different lengths, which is a reasonable behavior given the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases.

Overall, the implementation meets the requirements for all valid inputs, and since I cannot find any case where it fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
