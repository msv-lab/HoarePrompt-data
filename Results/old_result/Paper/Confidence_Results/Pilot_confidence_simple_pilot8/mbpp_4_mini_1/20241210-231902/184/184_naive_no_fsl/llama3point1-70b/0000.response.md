Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly filter odd numbers as per the problem description. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is intended to return odd numbers, but it incorrectly uses the condition `num % 2 != 0` to check for odd numbers. 

For example, if the input list is `[2, 4, 6]`, the expected output should be an empty list `[]` since there are no odd numbers. However, if the input list is `[1, 3, 5]`, the output will be `[1, 3, 5]`, which is correct. 

However, if we consider the input list `[]` (an empty list), the output would also be `[]`, which is correct. 

The issue arises with the interpretation of "filtering odd numbers." If we consider edge cases such as negative odd numbers or non-integer types in the list (e.g., strings or floats), the function does not handle these cases. 

Therefore, since the program does not guarantee correctness for all potential cases, the overall correctness is deemed false.
