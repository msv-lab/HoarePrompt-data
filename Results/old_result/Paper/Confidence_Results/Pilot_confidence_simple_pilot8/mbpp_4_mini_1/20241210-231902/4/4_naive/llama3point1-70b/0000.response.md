Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. It does this by using the XOR operator (`^`), which will produce a binary number where each bit is 1 if the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different and 0 if they are the same. The function then counts the number of 1s in the resulting binary representation using `bin(...).count('1')`. If the count is exactly 1, it indicates that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description. 

All potential cases, including edge cases like when one number is 0 and the other is 1, or when both numbers are the same, are handled correctly by this implementation. Thus, the function meets the problem description's criteria.
