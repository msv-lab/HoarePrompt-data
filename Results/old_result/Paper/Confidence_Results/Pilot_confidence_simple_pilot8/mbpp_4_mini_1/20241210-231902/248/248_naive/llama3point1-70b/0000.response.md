Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. It handles all potential cases, including empty lists, lists of varying data types, and nested lists. For example:

- An empty list `[]` will correctly convert to an empty tuple `()`.
- A list with integers `[1, 2, 3]` will convert to the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`.
- A list with mixed types `[1, 'a', 3.14]` will convert to the tuple `(1, 'a', 3.14)`.

Since the function works as intended for all possible inputs, the correctness is confirmed.
