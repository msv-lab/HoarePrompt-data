Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes an input list and returns a tuple created from that list using the built-in `tuple()` function.

I have considered various potential cases, including:
- An empty list (`[]`), which should return an empty tuple (`()`).
- A list with different data types (`[1, 'a', 3.14]`), which should return a tuple with the same elements (`(1, 'a', 3.14)`).
- A list with nested lists (`[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`), which should return a tuple of lists (`([1, 2], [3, 4])`).

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected and returns the correct tuple representation of the input list. Thus, I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
