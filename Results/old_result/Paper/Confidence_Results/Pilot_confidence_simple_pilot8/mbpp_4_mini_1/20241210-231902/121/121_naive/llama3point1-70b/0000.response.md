Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but it has a flaw in the logic of the `func_2` function. Specifically, the condition `if num % 6 in [1, 5]:` is not sufficient to ensure that all Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are identified, as there may be valid primes that do not satisfy this condition.

For example, the 5th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is 31, which is prime and satisfies the condition, but there could be other primes that are incorrectly skipped due to the modulo condition. Moreover, the logic does not handle cases where the input `n` is less than 1, which should ideally return an error or a specific value, as there is no 0th or negative nth prime.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
