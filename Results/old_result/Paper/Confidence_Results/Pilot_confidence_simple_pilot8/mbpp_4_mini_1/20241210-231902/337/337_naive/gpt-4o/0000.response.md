To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirement and the implementation.

Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

Program:
```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the sum of non-repeated elements. However, the use of `set(lst)` will only return unique elements from the list, which means it will include elements that are repeated in the original list, but only once in the sum. This does not satisfy the requirement of summing only the non-repeated elements.

Let's consider a specific case to illustrate the issue:

1. Input: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`
   - The non-repeated elements should be `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`.
   - Their sum is `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`.
   - However, `func_1` will return `21` because it sums all unique elements, which includes `1` only once.

Since the program does not meet the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements and fails for the test case provided, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
