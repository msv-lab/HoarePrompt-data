Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly identifies and sums the non-repeated elements in the given list. The use of a generator expression within the `sum` function iterates through each element in the list and checks if its count in the list is equal to 1. If it is, that element is included in the sum. 

This implementation will work correctly for various cases, including:
1. An empty list, which will return 0.
2. A list with all repeated elements, which will also return 0.
3. A list with some unique elements, where only those elements will contribute to the final sum.

Since I cannot find any potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
