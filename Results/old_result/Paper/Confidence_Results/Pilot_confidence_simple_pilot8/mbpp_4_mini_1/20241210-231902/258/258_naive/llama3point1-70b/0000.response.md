To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem description:** Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program converts the input number `num` into a string to iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the number of digits in the number (`num_len`).
3. It then computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Finally, it checks if this sum is equal to the original number `num`.

**Armstrong Number Definition:** An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits `n` is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of `n`.

**Potential Cases:**
- For single-digit numbers (0-9), each number is an Armstrong number because any digit raised to the power of 1 is itself.
- For two-digit numbers, none are Armstrong numbers because the maximum sum (9^2 + 9^2 = 162) exceeds any two-digit number.
- For three-digit numbers, we can check a few:
  - 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.
  - 370 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 370.
  - 371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371.
  - 947 is not an Armstrong number because 9^3 + 4^3 + 7^3 = 729 + 64 + 343 = 1136, which is not equal to 947.

The program correctly identifies Armstrong numbers based on the definition. 

However, it does not handle negative numbers correctly. For example:
- If we input `-153`, the program will still compute `(-153) == (-1)^3 + 5^3 + 3^3`, which is logically incorrect since Armstrong numbers are defined for non-negative integers.

**Conclusion:**
Since the program fails to correctly handle negative numbers, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
