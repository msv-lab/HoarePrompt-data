Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given positive integer `n`. The function uses `math.comb(n, i)` to compute the binomial coefficient for each index `i` from `0` to `n`, and it only adds those coefficients where `i` is even. 

For example:
- If `n = 4`, the even indices are `0`, `2`, and `4`, and the corresponding binomial coefficients are `C(4, 0)`, `C(4, 2)`, and `C(4, 4)`, which sum to `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`.
- If `n = 5`, the even indices are `0`, `2`, and `4`, and the corresponding binomial coefficients are `C(5, 0)`, `C(5, 2)`, and `C(5, 4)`, which sum to `1 + 10 + 5 = 16`.

The program handles all valid inputs correctly according to the problem description.
