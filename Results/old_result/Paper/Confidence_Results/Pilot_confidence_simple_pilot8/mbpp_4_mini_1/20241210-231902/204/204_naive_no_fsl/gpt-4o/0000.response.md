Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case for the month number 4 (April) and the month number 9 (September), both of which have 30 days. The function `func_1` is supposed to check if a given month number has 31 days, but it does not account for the fact that there are months with fewer than 31 days that are not included in the assertions. 

For example:
- `func_1(4)` should return `False` (April has 30 days), but it is not tested in the assertions.
- `func_1(9)` should return `False` (September has 30 days), but it is also not tested in the assertions.

Since there are potential cases (like the months 4 and 9) that are not handled correctly, the program is incorrect.
