To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate the function `func_1` that is supposed to return the angle of a complex number. 

The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function then constructs a complex number using these parts and returns its phase (angle) using the `cmath.phase` function.

Let's analyze the provided test cases:

1. `func_1(0, 1j)` should return the angle of the complex number `0 + 1j`, which is `π/2` or approximately `1.5707963267948966`. This is correct.
2. `func_1(2, 1j)` should return the angle of the complex number `2 + 1j`, which is approximately `0.4636476090008061`. This is also correct.
3. `func_1(0, 2j)` should return the angle of the complex number `0 + 2j`, which again is `π/2` or approximately `1.5707963267948966`. This is correct as well.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases or other inputs:

- If we input `func_1(0, 0)`, the function will return `0`, which is mathematically ambiguous because the angle of the origin (0,0) is undefined. The function does not handle this case, and it should ideally raise an exception or return a special value indicating that the angle cannot be determined.
- If we input `func_1(-1, 0)`, the function should return `π` (or `3.141592653589793`), which is correct.
- If we input `func_1(1, -1)`, the function should return `-π/4` (or approximately `-0.7853981633974483`), which is also correct.

However, the critical issue arises with the input `(0, 0)`, as the function does not define the angle for this case, which is a potential input that the program fails to handle correctly.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly handle the case when both the real and imaginary parts are zero, which means it does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case.
