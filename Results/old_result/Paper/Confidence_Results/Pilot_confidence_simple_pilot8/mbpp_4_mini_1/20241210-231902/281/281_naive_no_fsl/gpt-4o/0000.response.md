Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1` to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` accurately filters out even numbers by checking if each number is divisible by 2 without a remainder. 

The provided assertions test various cases, and they all pass as expected:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output is `[2, 4]`, which is correct.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, the output is `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, which is also correct.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, the output is `[8, 12]`, which is correct as well.

No edge cases or potential input scenarios have been overlooked, such as negative even numbers, large numbers, or an empty list, as the function handles all integers and will return an empty list if there are no even numbers. Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.
