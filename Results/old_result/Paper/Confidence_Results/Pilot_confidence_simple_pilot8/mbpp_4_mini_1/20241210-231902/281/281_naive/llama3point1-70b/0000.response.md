Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers by using a list comprehension that checks if each number is divisible by 2. It handles all potential cases, including negative even numbers, zero, and an empty list. For any input list of integers, it will return a list containing only the even numbers, which aligns with the problem description.
