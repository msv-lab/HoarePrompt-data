Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and accesses the last character using the index `-1`. This works for all possible inputs, including:

1. Non-empty strings: It will return the last character as expected.
2. Empty strings: If an empty string is present in the tuple, it will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `s[-1]`.

However, since the problem description does not specify how to handle empty strings, the program may not be considered fully correct in a strict sense. Therefore, the program does not handle the potential case of empty strings correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
