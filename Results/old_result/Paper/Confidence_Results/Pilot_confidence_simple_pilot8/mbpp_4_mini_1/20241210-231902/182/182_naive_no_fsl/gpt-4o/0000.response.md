Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where any string in the tuple is empty. For example, if the input is `('', 'for', 'Vers')`, the function will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the last element of an empty string. This means that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
