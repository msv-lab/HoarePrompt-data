Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the specified list `nums` is sorted or not by comparing it to the result of `sorted(nums)`, which returns a new list that is sorted in ascending order. If `nums` is equal to the sorted version of itself, it means that `nums` is sorted. This logic holds for all potential cases, including:

1. An empty list `[]`, which is considered sorted.
2. A list with one element, e.g., `[5]`, which is also sorted.
3. A list with multiple elements in ascending order, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.
4. A list with multiple elements in descending order, e.g., `[3, 2, 1]`, which would return `False`.
5. A list with duplicate elements, e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`, which is sorted.

Since the function correctly identifies whether any given list is sorted for all these cases, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
