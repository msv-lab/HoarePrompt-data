Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements a function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array in reverse order, checking each element against the target. If it finds a match, it returns the index of that match. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns -1. 

The function handles various cases correctly:
1. If the target is present multiple times, it correctly returns the last occurrence.
2. If the target is not present, it returns -1 as expected.
3. It works for edge cases such as an empty array or a target that is less than the smallest or greater than the largest element in the array.

Thus, the code meets the problem's requirements for all potential cases.
