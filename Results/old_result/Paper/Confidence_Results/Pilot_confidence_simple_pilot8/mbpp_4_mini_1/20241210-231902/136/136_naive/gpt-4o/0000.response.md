Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly filters the dictionary to include only those entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The logic used in the dictionary comprehension is sound, and it has been validated with multiple test cases. 

For example:
- When `n` is 170, it returns the expected entries: `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`.
- When `n` is 180, it returns `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is correct.
- When `n` is 190, it returns `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is also correct.

The program handles various cases correctly, including edge cases where all values are below `n`, and it returns an empty dictionary in such scenarios. Thus, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
