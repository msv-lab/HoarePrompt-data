Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list and a tuple as input and returns a new list that is the result of adding the elements of the tuple to the end of the list.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Types**: The function accepts a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`). It does not impose any constraints on the types of elements within the list or tuple, which aligns with standard behavior in Python.

2. **Tuple to List Conversion**: The function converts the tuple to a list using `list(input_tuple)`, which is a standard way to convert a tuple into a list.

3. **List Concatenation**: The function concatenates the original list with the newly created list from the tuple using the `+` operator. This operation is valid in Python and produces a new list that contains all elements from the original list followed by all elements from the tuple.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the newly created list, which is the expected behavior as per the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles various edge cases, such as:
   - An empty list and a non-empty tuple (e.g., `func_1([], (1, 2))` returns `[1, 2]`).
   - A non-empty list and an empty tuple (e.g., `func_1([1, 2], ())` returns `[1, 2]`).
   - Both the list and tuple being empty (e.g., `func_1([], ())` returns `[]`).

Since I cannot find any input case where the function fails to meet the requirements described, I conclude that the implementation is correct.

Thus, the final assessment is:
Correctness: **True**
