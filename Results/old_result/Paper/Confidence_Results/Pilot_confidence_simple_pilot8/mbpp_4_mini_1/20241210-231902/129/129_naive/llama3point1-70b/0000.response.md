Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a single character using the `ord()` function. It adheres to the problem description by taking a string input that is expected to be a single character and returning its ASCII value as an integer. 

Since the `ord()` function is designed to handle any valid single character input (including letters, digits, punctuation, etc.), there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail. The function will raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a string or a `ValueError` if the string length is not equal to one, which is appropriate given the problem description specifies a single character.

Thus, the implementation is complete and correct for all valid inputs as per the problem description.
