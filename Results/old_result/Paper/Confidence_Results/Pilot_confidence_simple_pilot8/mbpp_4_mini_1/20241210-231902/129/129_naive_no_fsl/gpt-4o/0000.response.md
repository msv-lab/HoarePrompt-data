Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a character using the `ord()` function. The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function returns the expected ASCII values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. 

The `ord()` function works for all single-character strings, including special characters, digits, and letters from various alphabets. Since there are no restrictions mentioned in the problem description regarding the input (such as only uppercase letters), the function will correctly handle any single character provided to it.

Therefore, I cannot think of any potential cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description. Hence, the code is correct for all valid inputs.
