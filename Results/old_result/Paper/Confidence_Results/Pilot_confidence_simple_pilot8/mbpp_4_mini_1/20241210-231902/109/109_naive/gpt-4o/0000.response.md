Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list as required by the problem description. Instead, it removes the last element of the first list and concatenates the second list to it.

For example:
- If we call `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])`, the expected output according to the problem description would be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which is what the assertion checks. However, in reality, the function would return `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which matches the assertion but does not fulfill the requirement of replacing the last element.
- If we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4])`, we would expect `[1, 2, 4]` (replacing `3` with `4`), but the function would return `[1, 2] + [4]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 4]`, which is still correct but does not fulfill the requirement of replacing the last element.

However, if the first list is empty, the function will produce an incorrect result:
- For example, `func_1([], [1, 2])` would return `[1, 2]`, but according to the problem description, this case is not defined (there's no last element to replace).

Thus, the function does not handle the case where the first list is empty, leading to incorrect behavior in that scenario.
