To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The function should take two lists and replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

### Program Analysis:
The provided function `func_1` is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        list1 = list2
    return list1
```

### Key Points of the Implementation:
1. **Non-empty `list1`:** If `list1` is not empty, the last element of `list1` is replaced with the elements of `list2`. This is done using slicing (`list1[-1:] = list2`), which effectively replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements from `list2`.
   
2. **Empty `list1`:** If `list1` is empty, the code attempts to assign `list2` to `list1`. However, this does not modify the original `list1` outside the function because assignment to `list1` creates a new local reference and does not affect the original list passed in.

### Potential Issues:
- **If `list1` is empty:** The function does not actually modify the original `list1` to contain the elements of `list2`. Instead, it creates a new local reference to `list2`, which is discarded when the function exits. Therefore, the original `list1` remains empty.

### Example Case:
- Input: `list1 = []`, `list2 = [1, 2, 3]`
  - Expected output: `[1, 2, 3]` (since `list1` is empty, it should take the elements of `list2`)
  - Actual output: `[]` (since `list1` remains unchanged)

### Conclusion:
The function does not behave correctly according to the problem description for the case when `list1` is empty. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
