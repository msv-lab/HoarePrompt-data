Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. According to the description, the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. However, the implementation instead removes the last element of the first list and appends the second list to the end.

For example, consider the following case:
```python
func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
```
The expected output should be:
```python
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
```
But the actual output from the function would be:
```python
[1, 2] + [4, 5, 6] => [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
```
This is incorrect because it does not replace the last element of the first list (which is `3`) with the elements of the second list.

Thus, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
