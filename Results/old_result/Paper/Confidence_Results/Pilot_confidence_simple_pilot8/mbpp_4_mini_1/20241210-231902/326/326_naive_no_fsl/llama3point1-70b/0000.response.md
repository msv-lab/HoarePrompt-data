Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input array has fewer than two elements. In such cases, it is not possible to find a minimum difference between two elements, as there aren't enough elements in the array. For example:

- If the input array is `[]` (empty), the program will return `inf`, which is not a valid output for the problem description.
- If the input array is `[5]`, the program will also return `inf`, as there is only one element.

Since the program does not account for these edge cases, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
