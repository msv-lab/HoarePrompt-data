Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input array has fewer than two elements. If the input array has one or zero elements, the function will attempt to access `arr[i + 1]` when `i` is the last index, which will result in an "index out of range" error. Additionally, the problem description specifies finding the minimum difference between any two elements, but the program does not account for the scenario when there are not enough elements to compare. 

For example, if the input is `arr = [5]`, the function will fail because it tries to compare the only element with a non-existent second element.
