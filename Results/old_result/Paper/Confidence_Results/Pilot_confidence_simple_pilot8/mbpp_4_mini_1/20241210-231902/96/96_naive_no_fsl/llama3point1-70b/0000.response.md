Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It does this by creating a set of the types of each element in the tuple and checking if the length of that set is 1. If all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one unique type, resulting in a length of 1.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the correctness:

1. `func_1((1, 2, 3))` returns `True` (all are integers).
2. `func_1((1, 2.0, 3))` returns `False` (int and float are different types).
3. `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'))` returns `True` (all are strings).
4. `func_1((1, '2', 3.0))` returns `False` (int, str, and float are different types).
5. `func_1(())` returns `True` (an empty tuple is trivially of the same type).

Since the program works for all potential cases, it is correct.
