Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It uses a set comprehension to create a set of types from the elements of the tuple. If all elements have the same type, the set will have a length of 1, and the function will return `True`. If there are different types, the set will have a length greater than 1, and the function will return `False`. 

I can't think of any edge cases or inputs where this function would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description. For example:
- For the input `(1, 2, 3)`, all elements are integers, so it returns `True`.
- For the input `(1, '2', 3)`, there are mixed types (int and str), so it returns `False`.
- For the input `()`, an empty tuple, it returns `True` since there are no elements to contradict the condition.

Thus, the function handles all potential cases correctly.
