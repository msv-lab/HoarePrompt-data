To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the implementation of the function `func_1`.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks if the value at that index is even.
2. If it finds an even number at any of the odd indices, it returns `False`.
3. If all odd indices contain odd numbers, it returns `True`.

**Test Cases in the Code:**
- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True`: This is incorrect because at index 1 (which is odd), the value is `1` (odd), and at index 3 (also odd), the value is `3` (odd), but at index 5 (odd), the value is `7` (odd), and at index 7 (odd), the value is `3` (odd). The function should return `True` here.
- `func_1([4, 1, 2])` returns `True`: This is incorrect because at index 1 (odd), the value is `1` (odd) and at index 2 (even), the value is `2` (even), but there is no odd index to check further. The function should return `True` here.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False`: This is correct because at index 1 (odd), the value is `2` (even), so it correctly returns `False`.

**Potential Missing Cases:**
- The function does not handle the case when the list is empty. An empty list should return `True` because there are no odd indices to check.
- The function does not check if the input list is valid (e.g., not just numbers).

Since the function fails to account for an empty list and does not handle potential edge cases properly, we can conclude that the program does not meet the problem requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
