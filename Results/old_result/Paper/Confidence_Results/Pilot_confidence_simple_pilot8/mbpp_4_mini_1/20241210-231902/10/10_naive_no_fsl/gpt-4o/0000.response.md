Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the calculation of the volume of a triangular prism based on the formula for the volume, which is given by the area of the triangular base multiplied by the length of the prism. 

The function `func_1(base, height, length)` computes the area of the triangular base using the formula `0.5 * base * height`, and then multiplies this area by the `length` to get the volume. 

The assertions provided in the program are also correct:
- For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`, the base area is `0.5 * 10 * 8 = 40`, and the volume is `40 * 6 = 240`.
- For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`, the base area is `0.5 * 3 * 2 = 3`, and the volume is `3 * 2 = 6`.
- For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`, the base area is `0.5 * 1 * 2 = 1`, and the volume is `1 * 1 = 1`.

Since all potential cases and the logic of the code align with the problem description, the program is correct.
