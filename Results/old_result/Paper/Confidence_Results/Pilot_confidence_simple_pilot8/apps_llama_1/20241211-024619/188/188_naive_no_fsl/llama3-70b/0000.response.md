Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It first reads the number of cards `n` and then reads the numbers written on each card.
2. It creates a dictionary `d` to store the frequency of each number written on the cards.
3. It then iterates over the dictionary to find two numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times. If such numbers are found, it prints "YES" and the two numbers. If not, it prints "NO".
4. The program correctly handles the case where there are less than two numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, in which case it prints "NO".
5. The program also correctly handles the case where there are more than two numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, in which case it prints the first two such numbers it finds.

The program passes all the example test cases provided, and it is not possible to find a counterexample where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct. 

Note that the program does not need to check all possible pairs of numbers, it only needs to find two numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, which makes it efficient. Also, the program does not need to handle the case where `n` is an odd number, because the problem statement guarantees that `n` is an even number.
