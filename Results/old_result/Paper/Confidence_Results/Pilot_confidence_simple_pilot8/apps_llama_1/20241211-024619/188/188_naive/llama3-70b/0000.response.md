Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. It does this by counting the occurrences of each number on the cards and checking if there are two numbers that each occur exactly n/2 times. If such numbers are found, it prints "YES" and the numbers; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- If there are two numbers that each occur exactly n/2 times, it correctly identifies them and prints "YES".
- If there is only one number that occurs exactly n/2 times, it correctly prints "NO" because Petya and Vasya must choose distinct numbers.
- If no number occurs exactly n/2 times, it correctly prints "NO" because the game cannot be fair.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when there are only two cards or when all cards have the same number.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, its correctness is **True**.
