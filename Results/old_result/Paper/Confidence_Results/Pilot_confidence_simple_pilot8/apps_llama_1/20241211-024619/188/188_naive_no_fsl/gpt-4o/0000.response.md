Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it seems to work correctly:

1. It first reads the number of cards (`n`) and then reads the values of each card.
2. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each unique number on the cards.
3. It then sorts the unique numbers based on their counts in ascending order.
4. If there are less than two unique numbers, it immediately prints "NO" because the game cannot be fair if there's only one unique number (as Petya and Vasya need to choose distinct numbers).
5. If there are at least two unique numbers, it checks if the counts of the two most frequent numbers are equal to `n // 2`. If this condition is met, it prints "YES" along with the two numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose to make the game fair.
6. If the condition in step 5 is not met, it prints "NO", indicating that the game cannot be fair.

The program seems to cover all possible cases:

- If there's only one unique number, it correctly prints "NO".
- If there are multiple unique numbers but none of them have a count of `n // 2`, it correctly prints "NO".
- If there are at least two unique numbers with counts of `n // 2`, it correctly prints "YES" along with the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, it seems that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
