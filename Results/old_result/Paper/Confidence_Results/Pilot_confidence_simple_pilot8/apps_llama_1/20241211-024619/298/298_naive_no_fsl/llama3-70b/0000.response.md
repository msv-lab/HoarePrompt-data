Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all cases correctly. One potential issue is that the program uses the `func_3` function to calculate the coordinates of the points, but this function does not guarantee that the points will be within the bounds specified by `n` and `m`.

For example, consider the input `n = 5`, `m = 3`, and `k = 2`. The program will calculate `n1` and `m1` using the `func_3` function, but it does not check if the resulting points are within the bounds of `n` and `m`.

Another issue is that the program only checks if `abs(n1 * m) >= g`, but it does not consider other possible combinations of points that could satisfy the condition.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to ensure that the calculated points are within the bounds of `n` and `m`, and that all possible combinations of points are considered.

Here is an example of an input where the program does not work correctly:
```
5 3 2
```
The program will output:
```
YES
0 0
0 3
3 0
```
However, the point `(3, 0)` is outside the bounds of `n = 5` and `m = 3`, so this is not a valid solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and needs to be modified to handle all cases correctly.
