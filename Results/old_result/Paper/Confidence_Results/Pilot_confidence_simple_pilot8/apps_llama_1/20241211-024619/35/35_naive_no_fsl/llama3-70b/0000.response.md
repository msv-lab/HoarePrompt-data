Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The condition `(a - x + (b - x) >= x)` in the while loop is not sufficient to ensure that the cakes can be distributed according to the problem description.

A counterexample can be found with the input `6 4 5`. The program will output `1`, but the optimal solution is to put 2 pieces of the first cake on 2 plates and 2 pieces of the second cake on 2 plates, and then put 2 pieces of the first cake on 1 plate and 3 pieces of the second cake on 1 plate, resulting in a minimum of 2 pieces per plate.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if there are enough pieces of cake to distribute `x` pieces to each plate, but it does not consider the actual distribution of the cakes. A correct solution would need to consider all possible ways to distribute the cakes and find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the maximum `x` such that we can distribute the cakes into two groups, one with `x` pieces of the first cake and the other with `x` pieces of the second cake, and the total number of plates used is less than or equal to `n`. We can use a binary search approach to find the maximum `x`.

Here is a correct Python solution:
```python
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    low, high = 1, min(a, b)
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if (a // mid) + (b // mid) <= n:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    print(high)

func()
```
This solution uses a binary search approach to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions. It starts with a range of possible values for `x` and repeatedly checks if the current `x` is valid. If it is, it increases the range to search for a larger `x`. If it is not, it decreases the range to search for a smaller `x`. The process continues until the range is empty, at which point the maximum `x` is found.
