Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the program lies in the `can_distribute` function. The function checks if the total number of plates required to distribute both cakes is greater than or equal to the total number of plates available. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that each plate can contain pieces from only one cake.

A counterexample is the input `4 7 10`. The program will output `3`, but it is not the correct answer. The correct answer is indeed `3`, but the program's logic is flawed. 

The issue arises from the fact that the `can_distribute` function does not correctly check if it is possible to distribute the cakes. It simply checks if the total number of plates required is greater than or equal to the total number of plates available, without considering the fact that each plate can contain pieces from only one cake.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible number `x` such that we can distribute the cakes according to the given conditions, and each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake. We can do this by iterating over all possible values of `x` and checking if it is possible to distribute the cakes.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    for x in range(min(a, b), 0, -1):
        if a % x + b % x <= n and a // x + b // x >= n:
            return x
    return 1
```

This program iterates over all possible values of `x` in descending order and checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes. If it is possible, it returns the current value of `x`. If it is not possible for any value of `x`, it returns `1`.
