Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The condition `(a - x + (b - x) >= x)` in the while loop is incorrect. This condition does not guarantee that the minimum number of pieces on each plate is maximized.

A correct approach would be to try all possible values of `x` from the maximum possible value down to 1, and check if it's possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces.

Here is a counterexample: 

Input: 
```
6 4 8
```
The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `2`. 

In this case, we can distribute the cakes as follows: 

- Two plates with 2 pieces of the first cake each
- Two plates with 4 pieces of the second cake each
- Two plates with 0 pieces of the first cake and 0 pieces of the second cake is not allowed, so the last two plates will have 2 and 2 pieces of the second cake or 1 and 3 pieces of the second cake, but 1 piece is not allowed as x = 2.

So, the minimum number of pieces on each plate is `2`, not `1`. 

This example shows that the given program does not work correctly for all inputs.
