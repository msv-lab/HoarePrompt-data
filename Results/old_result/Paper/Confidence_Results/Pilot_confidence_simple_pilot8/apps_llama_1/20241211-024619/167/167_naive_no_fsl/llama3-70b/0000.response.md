Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

The issue with the program is that it only checks for possible values of x and y up to 1,000,000, whereas the problem statement allows x and y to be up to 10^9. 

For example, if the input is:

2
1 1000001

The program will print 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' with x = 1 and y = 1000001. 

This is because the program only checks for x and y up to 1,000,000, and does not consider the possibility of x = 1 and y = 1000001, which is a valid solution according to the problem description. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect. 

To fix this issue, the program should check for all possible values of x and y up to 10^9, or use a more efficient algorithm to find the possible values of x and y. 

However, it's worth noting that the program does work correctly for the examples provided in the problem description, but it does not work correctly for all possible inputs. 

Another issue is that the program does not handle the case when the input list a contains duplicate values. The program should check if the duplicate values are adjacent in the list and if they correspond to the same cell in the matrix. 

Also, the program does not handle the case when the input list a is empty. The program should print 'NO' in this case. 

Overall, the program has several issues that need to be addressed to make it correct.
