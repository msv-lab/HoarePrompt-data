Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is equal to `t`. This is because the first `k` spectators stand one by one, so at time `t`, `t` spectators are standing.

2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators is equal to `k`. This is because after the first `k` spectators have stood, the `k`-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits, and this pattern continues. So, the number of standing spectators remains `k` until `t` is greater than `n`.

3. If `t` is greater than `n`, the number of standing spectators starts to decrease. The program correctly calculates this by subtracting `t` from `n + k`. This is because at time `n + k`, all spectators are sitting, and the number of standing spectators decreases by 1 for each time unit after `n`.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including when `t` is equal to `k`, `n`, or `n + k`. 

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. 

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
