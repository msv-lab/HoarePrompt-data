Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct because it handles all the possible cases as described in the problem statement. 

- If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is `t`, because the spectators stand one by one until `k` spectators are standing.
- If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators is `k`, because the first `k` spectators are standing.
- If `t` is greater than `n`, the number of standing spectators is `n + k - t`, because the spectators start sitting down from the first one, and `n + k - t` gives the number of spectators still standing.

The program correctly implements these conditions, and there are no obvious edge cases that it does not handle. The examples provided also support the correctness of the program. 

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct for all possible cases.
