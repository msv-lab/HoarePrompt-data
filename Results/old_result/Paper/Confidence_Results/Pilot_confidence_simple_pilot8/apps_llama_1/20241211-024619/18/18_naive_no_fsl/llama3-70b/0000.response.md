Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

Here's why:

- For `t <= n`, the program prints `min(t, k)`, which is correct because the number of standing spectators increases by 1 at each time step until `k` spectators are standing. If `t` is less than `k`, then `t` spectators are standing. If `t` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` spectators are standing.

- For `t > n`, the program prints `k - (t - n) % k`, which is also correct. After `n` time steps, all spectators have stood up and the wave starts to sit down. The number of standing spectators decreases by 1 at each time step, repeating the cycle every `k` time steps. The expression `(t - n) % k` calculates the number of time steps since the last full cycle, and subtracting this from `k` gives the correct number of standing spectators.

The program handles all edge cases, including when `t` is equal to `n` or `n + k`, and when `k` is equal to `n`. The use of the `min` function and the modulo operator ensures that the program produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

I have not been able to find any case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
