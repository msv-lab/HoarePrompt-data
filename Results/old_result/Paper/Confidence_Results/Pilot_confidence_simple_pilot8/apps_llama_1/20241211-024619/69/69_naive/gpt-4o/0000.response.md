Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not handle all possible cases correctly. The issue lies in the way it calculates the minimum length of the subsegment to be changed. 

The program only checks if the target position is in the position map, but it does not consider the case where the target position is not in the map but can be reached by changing some operations. 

For example, if the input is:
```
5
RURUU
-2 3
```
The program will return 3, which is correct. However, if the input is:
```
6
RRRRRR
-3 0
```
The program will return -1, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 3, because we can change the first three operations to LLL to reach the target position.

Another issue with the program is that it does not handle the case where the target position is not reachable by changing some operations. In such cases, the program should return -1.

To fix these issues, we need to modify the program to correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment to be changed. We can do this by using a different approach, such as using dynamic programming to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position.

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            new_x = 0
            new_y = 0
            for k in range(i):
                if operations[k] == 'U':
                    new_y += 1
                elif operations[k] == 'D':
                    new_y -= 1
                elif operations[k] == 'L':
                    new_x -= 1
                elif operations[k] == 'R':
                    new_x += 1
            for k in range(i, j+1):
                if operations[k] == 'U':
                    new_y -= 1
                elif operations[k] == 'D':
                    new_y += 1
                elif operations[k] == 'L':
                    new_x += 1
                elif operations[k] == 'R':
                    new_x -= 1
            for k in range(j+1, n):
                if operations[k] == 'U':
                    new_y += 1
                elif operations[k] == 'D':
                    new_y -= 1
                elif operations[k] == 'L':
                    new_x -= 1
                elif operations[k] == 'R':
                    new_x += 1
            if new_x == x and new_y == y:
                min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1)
    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else -1
```
This corrected code uses a brute force approach to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position. It checks all possible subsegments and returns the minimum length of the subsegment that results in the target position. If no such subsegment is found, it returns -1.
