Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it calculates the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the given time limit, but it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks.

A correct approach would be to use a 3D dynamic programming table to store the maximum number of points that can be earned by solving subtasks from different tasks within the given time limit. However, the given program uses a 2D table and tries to calculate the maximum number of points by summing the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved for each task, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 2 3
1 2
```
The program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `3`. Polycarp can solve the first subtask of both tasks, earning 2 points, and then solve the first subtask of one of the tasks again, earning 1 more point, for a total of 3 points.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to use a 3D dynamic programming table and consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks. 

Here is a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            for task in range(k):
                if j >= t[task]:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[task]] + 1)
            if j >= sum(t):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - sum(t)] + k + 1)
    print(dp[n][M])

func()
```
This implementation uses a 2D table to store the maximum number of points that can be earned by solving subtasks from different tasks within the given time limit. It iterates over each task and each possible time limit, and updates the table accordingly. The final result is stored in `dp[n][M]`.

Note that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n*M*k) and a space complexity of O(n*M), which may not be efficient for large inputs. A more efficient solution may be possible using a different approach, such as using a priority queue or a greedy algorithm.
