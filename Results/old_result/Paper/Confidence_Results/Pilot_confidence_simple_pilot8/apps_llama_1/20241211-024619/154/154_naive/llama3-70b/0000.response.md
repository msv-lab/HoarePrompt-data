Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem statement asks to find the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn by solving subtasks in any order, where each task consists of k subtasks, and the time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index.

The program attempts to solve this problem using dynamic programming, but it has a logical flaw. The current implementation only considers solving subtasks in a specific order (i.e., from the first subtask to the k-th subtask) and does not account for the possibility of solving subtasks from different tasks in any order.

For example, consider the input: 
```
3 4 11
1 2 3 4
```
The correct output should be 6, which can be achieved by completing the first task (1+2+3+4 = 10 minutes) and solving one subtask of the second task (1 minute). However, the program may not produce this output because it does not consider solving subtasks from different tasks in any order.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible combinations of solving subtasks from different tasks and choose the combination that maximizes the total points earned. This can be achieved using a more complex dynamic programming approach or other optimization techniques.

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [0] * (M + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(M, -1, -1):
            for l in range(1, k + 1):
                time = sum(t[:l])
                if j >= time:
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - time] + l + (1 if l == k else 0))
    print(dp[M])
```
This implementation uses a dynamic programming approach to consider all possible combinations of solving subtasks from different tasks and chooses the combination that maximizes the total points earned.
