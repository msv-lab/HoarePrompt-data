Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the length of the genome `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and returns, as it's impossible to decode the genome with equal counts of each nucleotide.

2. It then initializes a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the counts of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the genome.

3. The program iterates over the genome string `s` and updates the counts of each nucleotide in the `counts` dictionary.

4. It checks if any nucleotide has a count greater than the target count (`n // 4`). If so, it prints "===" and returns, as it's impossible to decode the genome with equal counts of each nucleotide.

5. The program then iterates over the genome string `s` again. For each unrecognized nucleotide ('?'), it tries to replace it with a nucleotide that has a count less than the target count. This ensures that the counts of each nucleotide become equal.

6. Finally, the program prints the decoded genome string.

The program handles all the examples provided in the problem description correctly. It also checks for edge cases where the length of the genome is not divisible by 4 or where a nucleotide has a count greater than the target count.

After analyzing the program, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
