Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly implements the task of decoding the genome by replacing each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') so that the number of nucleotides of each type becomes equal. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each nucleotide type in the input string `s`. It uses a dictionary `count` to store these counts.

2. It then calculates the average count of each nucleotide type by dividing the length of the genome `n` by 4. This average count represents the desired count of each nucleotide type in the decoded genome.

3. The program adjusts the `count` dictionary to store the number of missing occurrences of each nucleotide type. This is done by subtracting the current count of each nucleotide type from the average count.

4. It then iterates over the input string `s` again. For each unrecognized nucleotide '?', it replaces it with the first nucleotide type that has a positive count in the `count` dictionary. This ensures that the number of occurrences of each nucleotide type is increased to the desired average count.

5. Finally, the program checks if all counts in the `count` dictionary are zero. If any count is non-zero, it means that there are still some missing occurrences of a nucleotide type, and the program prints '===' to indicate that it's impossible to decode the genome. Otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- When the input string `s` already has an equal number of occurrences of each nucleotide type.
- When the input string `s` has some unrecognized nucleotides that can be replaced to achieve an equal number of occurrences of each nucleotide type.
- When it's impossible to decode the genome because the number of unrecognized nucleotides is not sufficient to achieve an equal number of occurrences of each nucleotide type.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
