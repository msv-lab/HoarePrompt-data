Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the sofa based on the given conditions. The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which only checks the position of the first cell of each sofa. However, the problem statement defines the position of a sofa based on the existence of two cells `a` and `b` such that `x_a < x_b` (or `y_a < y_b`), where `a` is covered by sofa A and `b` is covered by sofa B.

The current implementation does not consider all possible pairs of cells between two sofas, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if two sofas have cells `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` respectively, and `x1 < x2` but `y1 > y2`, the current implementation would incorrectly count this as a sofa to the left, even if the actual positions of the sofas do not satisfy the condition.

To fix this, the program should be modified to check all possible pairs of cells between two sofas and count the number of sofas that satisfy the conditions based on these pairs. 

Here's an example of how the `func_1` function could be modified to correctly implement the logic:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            left_sofa = False
            right_sofa = False
            top_sofa = False
            bottom_sofa = False
            for cell1 in sofa:
                for cell2 in s:
                    if cell1[0] < cell2[0]:
                        left_sofa = True
                    if cell1[0] > cell2[0]:
                        right_sofa = True
                    if cell1[1] < cell2[1]:
                        top_sofa = True
                    if cell1[1] > cell2[1]:
                        bottom_sofa = True
            if left_sofa:
                left += 1
            if right_sofa:
                right += 1
            if top_sofa:
                top += 1
            if bottom_sofa:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```

This modified function checks all possible pairs of cells between two sofas and counts the number of sofas that satisfy the conditions based on these pairs.
