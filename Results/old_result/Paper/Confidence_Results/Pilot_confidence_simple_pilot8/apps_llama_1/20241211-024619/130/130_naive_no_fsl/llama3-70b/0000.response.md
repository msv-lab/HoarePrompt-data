Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all cases. It only checks if the number of friends is greater than or equal to the number of new coins that need to be gifted (N - K + 1) and the minimum number of new coins required (L). However, it does not consider the case where the number of friends is less than the number of new coins that need to be gifted.

For example, if N = 10, M = 5, K = 5, and L = 5, the program will print 1, but it should print -1 because it is impossible for each friend to gift a different coin.

The correct program should also check if the number of friends is less than the number of new coins that need to be gifted. If it is, then it should print -1.

Another issue with the program is that it does not consider the case where the number of friends is greater than the total number of coins. In this case, it is impossible for each friend to gift a different coin, so the program should print -1.

For example, if N = 10, M = 11, K = 0, and L = 1, the program will print 1, but it should print -1 because it is impossible for each friend to gift a different coin.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to check all these conditions and handle them correctly. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M > N:
        print(-1)
    elif M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```
This corrected version of the program checks if the number of friends is greater than the total number of coins and handles this case correctly. It also checks if the number of friends is greater than or equal to the number of new coins that need to be gifted and the minimum number of new coins required, and handles these cases correctly.
