Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all cases correctly. One potential case that the program does not handle is when the total sum of the array is not zero, but it is not possible to split the array into two non-zero sum subarrays. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The total sum of the array is 15, which is not zero. However, the program will print:
```
YES
1
1 5
```
Which is correct, but it does not handle the case when the array cannot be split into two non-zero sum subarrays.

Another example is when the array has more than two elements with non-zero sum, but the program only checks for the first non-zero element. 

Consider the input:
```
4
1 2 -3 4
```
The program will print:
```
YES
2
1 3
4 4
```
However, this is not the only possible solution. The correct output could also be:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 4
```
Or:
```
YES
3
1 1
2 2
3 4
```
The program does not consider all possible solutions.

However, the main issue with the program is that it does not correctly implement the logic to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sum. It only checks for the first non-zero element and splits the array at that point, which is not sufficient to handle all cases.

A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible subarrays and checking if their sum is non-zero. If a subarray with non-zero sum is found, it should be added to the result and the remaining elements should be processed recursively. 

The program does not handle the case when the array has all zeros, it will go into an infinite loop. 

The program does not handle the case when the array cannot be split into subarrays with non-zero sum. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
0 0 0
```
The program will print:
```
NO
```
But it does not provide any explanation for why it is not possible to split the array.

A correct implementation would involve providing a clear explanation for why it is not possible to split the array, or providing an alternative solution if one exists.

In conclusion, the given program does not correctly implement the logic to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sum, and it does not handle all possible cases. Therefore, its correctness is **False**.
