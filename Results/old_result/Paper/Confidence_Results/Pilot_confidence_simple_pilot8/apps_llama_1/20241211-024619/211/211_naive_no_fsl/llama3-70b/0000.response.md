Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the program prints the number of new arrays and their indices in a single line, whereas the problem description requires printing the number of new arrays on a separate line, followed by the indices of each new array on separate lines.

For example, given the input:
```
3
1 2 -3
```
The program outputs:
```
YES
1 1 2
2 3 3
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
YES
2
1 2
3 3
```
This discrepancy occurs because the program does not follow the specified output format. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the sum of elements in the entire array is zero correctly. In such cases, it should print "NO" as per the problem description, but the program's logic for this case is incorrect. 

To fix this, the program should be modified to correctly handle the output format and the case where the sum of elements in the entire array is zero. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 0
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                k += 1
        print(k)
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                print(l, r)
                l = r + 1

func()
```
