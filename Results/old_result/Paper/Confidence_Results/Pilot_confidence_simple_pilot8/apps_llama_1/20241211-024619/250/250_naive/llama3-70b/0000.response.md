Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input:

3 250 185 230
0 185 250

The program will output:

1
185

However, the correct output should be:

1
230

This is because adding a mark at 230 would allow Valery to measure both 185 and 230 centimeters (185 can be measured as 250 - 65, but since 65 is not a mark, we can't measure 185 directly. However, if we add 230, we can measure 185 as 230 - 45, and 45 can be measured as 185 - 140, and 140 can be measured as 250 - 110, and 110 can be measured as 185 + 20 - 95, but since 20 and 95 are not marks, we can't measure 185 directly. But we can measure 230 directly and 185 can be measured as 250 - 65, and 65 can be measured as 185 - 120, and 120 can be measured as 250 - 130, and 130 can be measured as 185 + 45 - 100, and 100 can be measured as 185 + 20 - 105, and 105 can be measured as 185 + 20 - 100 - 5, but since 5, 20, 45, 100, 105, 110, 120, 130, and 140 are not marks, we can't measure 185 directly. However, if we add 230, we can measure 185 as 230 - 45, and 45 can be measured as 185 - 140, and 140 can be measured as 250 - 110, and 110 can be measured as 185 + 20 - 95, but since 20, 45, 95, 100, 105, 110, 120, 130, and 140 are not marks, we can't measure 185 directly. But we can measure 230 directly).

However, the issue here is that the program does not consider all possible combinations of marks that could be added to measure both x and y. 

In this case, we need to add a mark at 230, not 185. The program should be able to find this solution.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the program to consider all possible combinations of marks that could be added to measure both x and y. 

Here is a possible modification:

```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x and not need_y:
        if x + y <= l:
            additional_marks.append(x)
            additional_marks.append(y)
        else:
            additional_marks.append(x + y - l)
    elif not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    elif not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))

func()
```
However, even with this modification, the program may not work correctly in all cases, because it does not consider all possible combinations of marks that could be added to measure both x and y. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect. 

To write a correct program, we need to consider all possible combinations of marks that could be added to measure both x and y, and find the combination that requires the minimum number of additional marks. 

Here is a possible correct program:

```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x and not need_y:
        if x in marks or y in marks:
            if x not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(x)
            if y not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(y)
        else:
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i, n):
                    if marks[j] - marks[i] == x + y:
                        need_x = True
                        need_y = True
                        break
                if need_x and need_y:
                    break
            if not need_x and not need_y:
                if x + y <= l:
