Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the conversion of numbers from the golden system to decimal and compares them. The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value of a given number in the golden system by iterating over each digit from right to left (using `reversed(s)`) and adding the corresponding power of `q` multiplied by the digit value to the total decimal value.

The comparison of the two decimal values is done correctly using simple conditional statements, and the program prints the correct output based on the comparison result.

The program handles all potential cases, including numbers of different lengths and numbers with leading zeros. The use of `enumerate(reversed(s))` ensures that the digits are processed in the correct order, from right to left, and the power of `q` is calculated correctly for each digit.

The program also handles the case where the two input numbers are equal, in which case it prints "=".

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
