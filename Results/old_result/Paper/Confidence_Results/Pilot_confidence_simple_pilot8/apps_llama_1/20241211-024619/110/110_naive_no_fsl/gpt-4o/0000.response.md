Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct. It uses a priority queue to select the cells with the highest coverage, which is the number of possible positions of the scoop-net that cover the cell. The coverage of each cell is calculated by counting the number of possible positions of the scoop-net that cover the cell.

The program correctly calculates the expected number of caught fishes by dividing the total coverage of the selected cells by the total number of possible positions of the scoop-net.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the scoop-net is larger than the pond or when there are more fishes than cells in the pond.

The program also handles the case when the scoop-net is placed at the edge of the pond, where the coverage of the cells is reduced.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program, as the output matches the expected output.

The time complexity of the program is O(n*m*log(n*m)), which is reasonable for the given constraints.

The space complexity of the program is O(n*m), which is also reasonable for the given constraints.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and efficient, and it handles all possible cases correctly. 

However, without the ability to test the program with a wide range of inputs, it's impossible to be 100% certain that the program is correct in every case. But based on the provided information and the analysis of the code, it seems that the program is correct. 

One potential issue could be the use of floating point arithmetic, which can sometimes lead to precision errors. However, in this case, the problem statement explicitly allows for a relative error of up to 10^-9, which should be sufficient to handle any precision issues. 

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the code and the provided information, the program appears to be correct.
