Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not properly check if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. The function `func_1` swaps the positions of the 'X' in the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted strings are equal. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the actual moves that can be made in the puzzle.

A counterexample to the program is the following input:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```
The program will output "NO", but it should output "NO" because the puzzles can never be in the same configuration. The issue with the program is that it only checks if the sorted strings are equal after swapping the 'X' positions, but it does not consider the actual moves that can be made in the puzzle.

The correct approach to solve this problem would be to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to generate all possible moves from the initial configuration of both puzzles and check if they can reach the same configuration. 

In this case, the given code does not implement a correct algorithm to solve the problem, so it is incorrect.
