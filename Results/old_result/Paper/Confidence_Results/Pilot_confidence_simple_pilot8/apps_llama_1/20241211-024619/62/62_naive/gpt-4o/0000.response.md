Correctness: **True**

The program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. It first converts each number to decimal using the `func_1` function, which calculates the decimal value of a number given its digits and base. The function uses the standard method of converting a number from any base to decimal, which is to multiply the current decimal value by the base and add the current digit.

The program then compares the decimal values of the two numbers and prints the correct comparison result.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles different bases and digits correctly, and it also handles the case where the two numbers have different numbers of digits. The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the correctness of the program.

The `func_1` function is also correct, as it correctly calculates the decimal value of a number given its digits and base. The function iterates over the digits of the number from left to right, multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the current digit.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
