Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the input correctly: It reads the number of digits and the base of the first number, followed by the digits of the first number. Then, it reads the number of digits and the base of the second number, followed by the digits of the second number.

2. The program converts the numbers to decimal correctly: The `func_1` function correctly converts a number from any base to decimal. It does this by iterating over the digits of the number from left to right, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit.

3. The program compares the numbers correctly: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them and prints the correct result.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Numbers with different bases
- Numbers with different numbers of digits
- Numbers with leading zeroes (although the problem statement guarantees that there will be no leading zeroes)
- Numbers that are equal, less than, or greater than each other

The program also passes all the provided example test cases.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
