Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases. It checks if the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of k, and if the cells in the path from 'G' to 'T' are not obstacles. However, it does not consider the case when 'G' and 'T' are on the same side of an obstacle and the grasshopper cannot jump over the obstacle.

For example, if the input is:
```
6 2
G.#T..
```
The program will print 'NO' because the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is not a multiple of k. However, the grasshopper can jump over the obstacle to reach 'T'. 

The correct approach would be to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from 'G' to 'T'. This would allow the program to correctly handle cases where the grasshopper needs to jump over obstacles to reach 'T'.

Here's an example of how the program could be modified to use BFS:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        queue = deque([g])
        visited = {g}
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            if current == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            for jump in [k, -k]:
                next_position = current + jump
                if 0 <= next_position < n and next_position not in visited and s[next_position]!= '#':
                    queue.append(next_position)
                    visited.add(next_position)
        print('NO')
```
This modified program uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible paths from 'G' to 'T', and correctly handles cases where the grasshopper needs to jump over obstacles to reach 'T'.
