Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in the case when the input screen contains a single white pixel. According to the problem description, the frame's width is 1 pixel, and the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen. However, the program checks if the frame height and width are less than 2 and returns -1 in such cases. This is incorrect because a frame with a size of 1 is a valid frame.

For example, if the input is:
```
2 4
....
.w..
```
The program should output:
```
....
+w..
```
But it outputs:
```
....
.w..
```
This is because the program does not correctly handle the case when the frame size is 1. 

Another issue with the program is that it does not check if all white pixels are located on the frame. It simply draws a frame around the bounding box of the white pixels, which may not be the smallest possible frame that contains all white pixels.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when the frame size is 1 and to check if all white pixels are located on the frame. 

Additionally, the program should try all possible frame sizes and positions to find the smallest frame that contains all white pixels. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to correctly handle these cases:
```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if screen[i][j] == 'w']

    min_size = float('inf')
    min_frame = None

    for size in range(1, max(n, m) + 1):
        for i in range(n - size + 1):
            for j in range(m - size + 1):
                frame = [(x, y) for x in range(i, i + size) for y in range(j, j + size) if x == i or x == i + size - 1 or y == j or y == j + size - 1]
                if all(pixel in frame for pixel in white_pixels):
                    if size < min_size:
                        min_size = size
                        min_frame = (i, j, size)

    if min_frame is None:
        return -1

    i, j, size = min_frame
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for x in range(i, i + size):
        for y in range(j, j + size):
            if x == i or x == i + size - 1 or y == j or y == j + size - 1:
                if result[x][y] == '.':
                    result[x][y] = '+'
    return result
```
This modified program tries all possible frame sizes and positions to find the smallest frame that contains all white pixels. If no such frame is found, it returns -1.
