Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the required functionality. It first identifies the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, then calculates the frame size based on these coordinates. If the frame size exceeds the maximum of the screen's width and height, it prints -1, indicating that the required frame does not exist. Otherwise, it constructs the frame by replacing the corresponding black pixels with '+' and leaving the white pixels unchanged.

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the smallest possible square frame that contains all white pixels and does not exceed the screen's boundaries. The examples provided in the problem statement are also correctly handled by the program.

The program's logic is sound, and it does not contain any obvious errors or omissions. It correctly implements the required functionality and handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
