Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations where $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. 

The main issue lies in the `func_2(n)` function, which calculates $f_{max}(n)$. The function is supposed to calculate the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$. However, the current implementation simply calculates the GCD of all numbers from $1$ to $n$, which is not the correct way to calculate $f_{max}(n)$.

For example, when $n = 3$, the function `func_2(n)` returns $1$, which is incorrect. The correct value of $f_{max}(3)$ is $2$, as shown in the problem description.

Another issue lies in the `func_3(n, f_max_n)` function, which calculates the number of permutations where $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. The function uses a dynamic programming approach, but it does not correctly consider all possible permutations of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a more sophisticated approach that considers all possible permutations of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$ and calculates the value of $f(p)$ for each permutation. We can then count the number of permutations where $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$.

Here is an example of a correct implementation in Python:
```python
import math
import itertools

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def f(p):
    g = [p[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(p)):
        g.append(gcd(g[-1], p[i]))
    return len(set(g))

def f_max(n):
    max_f = 0
    for p in itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)):
        max_f = max(max_f, f(p))
    return max_f

def count_permutations(n, f_max_n):
    count = 0
    for p in itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)):
        if f(p) == f_max_n:
            count += 1
    return count % (10**9 + 7)

n = int(input())
f_max_n = f_max(n)
print(count_permutations(n, f_max_n))
```
This implementation correctly calculates the value of $f(p)$ for each permutation and counts the number of permutations where $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. However, please note that this implementation has a time complexity of $O(n!)$, which may not be efficient for large values of $n$. A more efficient implementation would require a more sophisticated approach.
