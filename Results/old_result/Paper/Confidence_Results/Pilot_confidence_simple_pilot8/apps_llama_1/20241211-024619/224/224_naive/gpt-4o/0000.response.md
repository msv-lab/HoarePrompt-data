Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks for the number of permutations of integers 1 to n, such that f(p) is equal to f_max(n), where f(p) is the number of distinct elements among the GCDs of the prefixes of p, and f_max(n) is the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations of integers 1 to n.

However, the provided program simply calculates the factorial of n-1, which is not the correct solution to the problem. The program does not take into account the GCDs of the prefixes of the permutations, and it does not calculate f_max(n) or count the number of permutations where f(p) equals f_max(n).

For example, when n = 3, the program outputs 2, which is the factorial of 2. However, the correct output should be 4, which is the number of permutations [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1] where f(p) equals f_max(3) = 2.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate f_max(n) and then count the number of permutations where f(p) equals f_max(n). This requires a more complex algorithm that takes into account the GCDs of the prefixes of the permutations. 

Here is an example of how the correct solution might look like:

```python
import math
import itertools

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def f(p):
    g = []
    for i in range(1, len(p) + 1):
        g_i = p[0]
        for j in range(1, i):
            g_i = gcd(g_i, p[j])
        g.append(g_i)
    return len(set(g))

def f_max(n):
    max_f = 0
    for p in itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)):
        max_f = max(max_f, f(p))
    return max_f

def count_permutations(n):
    count = 0
    f_max_n = f_max(n)
    for p in itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)):
        if f(p) == f_max_n:
            count += 1
    return count % MOD

n = int(input())
result = count_permutations(n)
print(result)
```

This solution calculates f_max(n) by generating all permutations of integers 1 to n and calculating f(p) for each permutation. It then counts the number of permutations where f(p) equals f_max(n). The result is printed modulo 10^9 + 7. 

However, this solution has a high time complexity due to the generation of all permutations, and it may not be efficient for large values of n. A more efficient solution would require a deeper understanding of the properties of f(p) and f_max(n).
