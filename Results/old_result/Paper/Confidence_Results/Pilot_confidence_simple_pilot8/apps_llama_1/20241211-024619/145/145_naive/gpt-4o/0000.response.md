Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for segments of a fixed length, which is not sufficient to cover all possible cases.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:
```
5
35017
```
In this case, the ticket can be divided into three segments: 3, 50, and 17, where 3 + 5 + 0 = 8 and 1 + 7 = 8. However, the program will not be able to find this division because it only checks for segments of length 1, 2, 3, and 4, but not for segments of length 2 and 3, which are required to divide the ticket into segments with equal sums.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check for all possible segment lengths and positions, not just fixed lengths. This can be achieved by using a more dynamic approach, such as using a sliding window or recursive function calls, to explore all possible segment divisions. 

For example, a correct implementation could involve iterating over all possible segment lengths and positions, and checking if the sum of each segment is equal to the target sum. If a valid division is found, the program should return 'YES', otherwise it should return 'NO'. 

Here is a simple example of how this could be implemented:

```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for target_sum in range(1, sum(int(digit) for digit in ticket) + 1):
        segment_count = 0
        current_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

This implementation checks for all possible target sums, and for each target sum, it checks if the ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums. If a valid division is found, it returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'.
