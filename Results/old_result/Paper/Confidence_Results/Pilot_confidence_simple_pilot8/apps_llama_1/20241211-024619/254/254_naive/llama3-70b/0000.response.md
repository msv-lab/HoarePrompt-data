Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not accurately solve the problem described. It attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garland intervals and checks if the LCM is divisible by each interval. However, this approach does not correctly determine whether it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that at least one garland is lit during each second after switching them on.

A counterexample can be found with the input `2 2 3`. According to the problem description, the output should be `YES`, as Mishka can choose `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 2`, and `x3 = 1` to achieve the desired outcome. However, the provided program may not always produce the correct result for this input or other similar inputs.

To correctly solve this problem, a different approach is needed, such as checking all possible combinations of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` to determine if there exists a combination that satisfies the condition. Alternatively, a more efficient algorithm can be developed to find a valid combination, if one exists.

Here is a simple example of how the program can be incorrect:
Let's consider the input `2 3 4`. The LCM of these numbers is `12`, which is divisible by `2`, `3`, and `4`. However, if we switch on the garlands at seconds `1`, `2`, and `3`, respectively, we can see that there are seconds where no garland is lit. Therefore, the program's output of `YES` for this input is incorrect.

A correct solution to this problem would involve checking all possible combinations of switching on the garlands and verifying that at least one garland is lit during each second after switching them on. The provided program does not perform this check and therefore may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.
