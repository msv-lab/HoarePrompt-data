Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue with the program is that it only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals is 1. However, this is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland during each second after switching the garlands on.

A counterexample is the input (2, 4, 6). In this case, the GCD of the three time intervals is 2, which is not 1. However, the program will print 'NO', which is incorrect. The correct answer is 'YES' because Mishka can choose x1 = 1, x2 = 2, and x3 = 3, which will result in the first garland being lit during seconds 1, 3, 5,..., the second garland being lit during seconds 2, 6, 10,..., and the third garland being lit during seconds 3, 9, 15,.... This will ensure that there is at least one lit garland during each second after switching the garlands on.

The program does not consider all possible combinations of time intervals and switch-on times, which is why it does not work correctly for all potential cases. A correct solution would need to consider all possible combinations and check if there is at least one lit garland during each second after switching the garlands on.
