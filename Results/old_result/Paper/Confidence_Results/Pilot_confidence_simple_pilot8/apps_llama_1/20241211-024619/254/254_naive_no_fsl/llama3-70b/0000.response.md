Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue with the program is that it only checks if the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garlands is divisible by each of the garland's time intervals. However, this is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit during each second after switching them on.

A counterexample is when the input is 2 3 4. The LCM of 2, 3, and 4 is 12, which is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. However, if we switch on the garlands at seconds 1, 2, and 3, respectively, we can see that there will be no garland lit during the 5th second.

The program does not consider the actual switching times of the garlands, which is crucial in determining whether at least one garland will be lit during each second. A correct solution would need to consider all possible switching times and check if there is a combination that satisfies the condition.

The provided code only checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the time intervals, which is not enough to guarantee the correct behavior. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
