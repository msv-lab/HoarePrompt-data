Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply counts the total number of lowercase letters in the string, which does not guarantee that the conditions for a "pretty set" are met. 

For example, consider the input string "aAa". The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1 because there is an uppercase letter 'A' between the two lowercase letters 'a'. 

The program does not check for the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the positions of the lowercase letters in the pretty set. It also does not check for the condition that all the letters in the pretty set should be distinct.

A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible subsets of the lowercase letters in the string and checking if each subset meets the conditions for a pretty set. The maximum size of such a subset would be the answer. 

Here's a simple example of how the program can fail:

Input:
```
3
aAa
```
Expected output:
```
1
```
Actual output:
```
2
```
