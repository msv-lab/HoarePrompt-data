Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct. It correctly generates all 12 possible expressions, calculates their values, and finds the maximum value and its corresponding expression. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem, including cases where there are multiple maximums (in which case it prints the first one in the list).

The use of the `max` function with a `key` argument is a concise and efficient way to find the maximum value and its corresponding expression. The program also correctly handles the formatting of the output expressions, including the use of parentheses to indicate the order of operations.

I was unable to find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem description, and it appears to be robust and able to handle any valid input.

The code is well-structured and easy to follow, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
