Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly implements the required functionality. It calculates all 12 possible expressions, stores them in a list, and then finds the maximum value. The corresponding expression is then printed based on the index of the maximum value in the list.

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the expressions with and without parentheses, which is essential for the correct output. The use of the `index` method to find the index of the maximum value in the list `a` and then using this index to print the corresponding expression from the list `b` is also correct.

The program does not contain any syntax errors, and it should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). The examples provided in the problem statement are also correctly handled by the program.

In summary, the program is correct, and it should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
