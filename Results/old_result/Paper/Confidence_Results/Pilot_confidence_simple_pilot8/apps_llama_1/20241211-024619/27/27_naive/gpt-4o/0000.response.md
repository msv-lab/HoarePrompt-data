Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. It calculates all 12 possible expressions, finds the maximum value, and prints the corresponding expression. 

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. The program correctly reads the input values `x`, `y`, and `z` from the standard input.
2. It defines all 12 possible expressions as specified in the problem description and stores them in the `expressions` list along with their corresponding string representations.
3. The `max` function is used with a `lambda` function as the `key` argument to find the maximum value and its corresponding expression. This ensures that the expression with the maximum value is found correctly.
4. The program prints the expression with the maximum value, which is the desired output.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program handles all possible inputs and edge cases correctly, and the examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
