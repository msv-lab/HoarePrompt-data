Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. 

For example, consider the input `1 2`. The program will output `No`, but the correct output should be `Yes` followed by `-1 -1`. This is because `2^(-1) + 2^(-1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1`, which satisfies the condition.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle cases where `n` is a power of 2. In such cases, the program will output `No`, but the correct output should be `Yes` followed by the power of 2 repeated `k` times.

The program also does not correctly handle cases where `n` is less than `k` but can still be represented as a sum of powers of 2. For example, consider the input `3 2`. The program will output `No`, but the correct output should be `Yes` followed by `1 1`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n/k`, and then try to represent `n` as a sum of powers of 2 using this power as the maximum. If we cannot represent `n` as a sum of powers of 2, we should output `No`. Otherwise, we should output `Yes` followed by the powers of 2 in descending order.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        if n == 1 and k == 2:
            print('Yes')
            print('-1 -1')
            return
        else:
            print('No')
            return
    a = []
    i = 0
    while n > 0:
        x = n.bit_length() - 1
        if x <= i:
            break
        a.append(x)
        n -= 2 ** x
        i += 1
    if len(a) < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = a[:k]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        print('Yes')
        print(' '.join(map(str, a)))

func()
```
However, the above solution still does not handle all the cases correctly. For example, it does not handle the case where `n` is a sum of different powers of 2.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a more complex algorithm that tries all possible combinations of powers of 2 and finds the one that represents `n` with the smallest maximum power.

Here is a more complex solution in Python:
```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    max_power = n.bit_length() - 1
    for max_y in range(max_power, -100, -1):
        powers = [i for i in range(max_y + 1)]
        for combination in combinations_with_replacement(powers, k):
            if sum(2 ** i for i in combination) == n:
                print('Yes')
                print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(combination, reverse=True))))
                return
    print('No')

func()
```
This solution tries all possible combinations of powers of 2 with a maximum power of `max_y`, and checks if the sum of the powers in the combination is equal to `n`. If it finds a combination that represents `n` with the smallest maximum power, it prints `Yes` followed by the powers in the combination in descending order. If it does not find any such combination, it prints `No`.
