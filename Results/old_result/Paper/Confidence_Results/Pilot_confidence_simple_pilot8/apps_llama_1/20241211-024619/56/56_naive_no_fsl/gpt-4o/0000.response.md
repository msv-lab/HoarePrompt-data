Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It first checks if it's possible to form a sequence of length `k` with the given number `n`. If `k` is greater than `n`, it immediately returns 'No' because it's impossible to form a sequence with more numbers than the sum of the sequence.

The program then uses bitwise operations to find the bits that are set in the binary representation of `n`. If the number of set bits is greater than `k`, it returns 'No' because it's impossible to form a sequence with the given number of integers.

If the number of set bits is less than `k`, it repeatedly splits the smallest bit into two smaller bits until it has `k` bits. This ensures that the maximum value in the sequence is as small as possible.

Finally, it sorts the bits in descending order and returns the sequence. This ensures that the sequence is lexicographically largest.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when `n` is 0, when `k` is 1, and when `n` is a power of 2. It also handles cases where `n` is negative or `k` is negative, although these cases are not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
