Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem. One potential case that the program does not handle is when the input `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is greater than 1. In this case, the program will output "No" because it tries to subtract the largest power of 2 from `n` until `n` becomes 0. However, this approach does not consider the case where `n` can be represented as the sum of multiple smaller powers of 2.

For example, if the input is `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the program will output "No" because it tries to subtract 2^2 from `n` and then `n` becomes 0, but it does not consider the case where `n` can be represented as 2^1 + 2^1.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `k`. In this case, the program should output "No" because it is not possible to find `k` integers such that the sum of 2 to the power of each number equals `n`. However, the program does not check if `n` is less than `k` correctly.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where `n` can be represented as the sum of multiple negative powers of 2. The program does not consider the case where `n` can be represented as 2^(-1) + 2^(-1) +... + 2^(-1), which is a valid solution.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should use a different approach that considers all possible cases, including the cases where `n` is a power of 2, `n` is less than `k`, and `n` can be represented as the sum of multiple negative powers of 2.
