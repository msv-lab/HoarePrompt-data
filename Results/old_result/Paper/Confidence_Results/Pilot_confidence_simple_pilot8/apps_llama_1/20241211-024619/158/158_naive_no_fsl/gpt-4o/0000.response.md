Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote, following the given ratio of 1:2:4.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, considering the available apples and pears. This is done by finding the minimum value between the number of lemons, half the number of apples (since each lemon requires 2 apples), and a quarter of the number of pears (since each lemon requires 4 pears).
2. It then calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by the corresponding ratio (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears).

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When there are enough fruits to cook the compote, it calculates the maximum total number of fruits.
* When there are not enough fruits, it correctly returns 0.

The provided examples demonstrate the program's correctness:

* For input (2, 5, 7), the program outputs 7, which is correct (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears).
* For input (4, 7, 13), the program outputs 21, which is correct (3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears).
* For input (2, 3, 2), the program outputs 0, which is correct (not enough pears to cook the compote).

Since the program handles all possible cases correctly and produces the expected output for the provided examples, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
