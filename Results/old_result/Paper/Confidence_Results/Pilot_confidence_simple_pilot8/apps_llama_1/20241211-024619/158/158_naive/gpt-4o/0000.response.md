Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used by finding the minimum of the number of lemons available, the number of apples available divided by 2, and the number of pears available divided by 4. This ensures that the ratio of lemons to apples to pears is always 1:2:4.

The program then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by 1 (for lemons), 2 (for apples), and 4 (for pears), and summing these values.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including cases where Nikolay has enough fruits to cook the compote and cases where he does not have enough fruits. For example, in the case where Nikolay has 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 7 pears, the program correctly calculates that he can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears, resulting in a total of 7 fruits. In the case where Nikolay has 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, the program correctly calculates that he cannot cook the compote and prints 0.

I have not found any cases where the program does not work as expected, and it correctly handles all the examples provided. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
