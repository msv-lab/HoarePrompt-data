Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in the least keg after pouring a glass of `s` liters. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first sorts the kegs by their volumes in ascending order. This is necessary because the Fair Nut wants to pour his glass in such a way that the kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible. By considering the kegs with the least volume first, the program ensures that it is maximizing the amount of kvass left in the least keg.

2. The program then uses a binary search approach to find the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in the least keg. It maintains a search range `[low, high]` and iteratively checks the midpoint `mid` of this range. 

3. For each `mid`, the program calculates the total amount of kvass that would be poured if `mid` liters are left in each keg. If this total is less than the desired amount `s`, it means that `mid` is too small, so the program updates `low` to `mid`. Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.

4. The program continues this binary search until `low` and `high` converge. At this point, `low` is the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in the least keg.

5. Finally, the program checks if it is actually possible to pour `s` liters of kvass by leaving `low` liters in each keg. If the total amount of kvass poured is not equal to `s`, it means that it is not possible to pour `s` liters, so the program prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `low`.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including the case where it is not possible to pour `s` liters of kvass. The binary search approach ensures that the program finds the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in the least keg efficiently. 

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the program, and it is not possible to find a counterexample where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
