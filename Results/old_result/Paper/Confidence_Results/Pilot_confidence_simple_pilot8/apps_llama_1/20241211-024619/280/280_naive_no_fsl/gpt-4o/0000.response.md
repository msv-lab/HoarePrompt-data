Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the path section in meters. 

One potential issue with the program is that it does not handle the case where the speed should decrease from `v1` to `v2`. In the given code, the line `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` always tries to increase the speed, but it should also consider the case where the speed should decrease.

For example, consider the input `10 5` and `4 2`. The program will calculate the speeds as `[10, 12, 14, 7]`, but the correct sequence of speeds should be `[10, 8, 6, 5]` to maximize the distance.

To fix this issue, the program should consider both the cases where the speed increases and decreases, and choose the one that maximizes the distance. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to handle this case:

```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t-1):
        speeds[i] = max(min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d), min(speeds[i - 1] - d, v2 - (t - i - 1) * d))
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
```
However, even this modified program may not always produce the correct result, because it does not consider all possible sequences of speeds. 

A correct program would need to use dynamic programming to consider all possible sequences of speeds and choose the one that maximizes the distance. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to use dynamic programming:

```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [[0] * (v1 + v2 + (t-1)*d + 1) for _ in range(t)]
    dp[0][v1] = v1
    for i in range(1, t):
        for j in range(v1 + v2 + (t-1)*d + 1):
            if dp[i-1][j] > 0:
                for k in range(max(1, j-d), min(v1 + v2 + (t-1)*d, j+d) + 1):
                    dp[i][k] = max(dp[i][k], dp[i-1][j] + k)
    total_distance = dp[-1][v2]
    print(total_distance)
```
This program uses a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum distance that can be achieved at each time step and each possible speed. It then uses dynamic programming to fill in the `dp` array and finally prints the maximum distance that can be achieved at the last time step and the final speed `v2`. 

This program should produce the correct result for all possible inputs.
