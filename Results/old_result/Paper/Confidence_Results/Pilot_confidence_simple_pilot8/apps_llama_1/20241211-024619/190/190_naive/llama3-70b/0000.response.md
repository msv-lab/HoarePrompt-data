Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the minimum cost of changing the lengths of sticks so that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer t.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program first sorts the list of stick lengths in ascending order. This is necessary to find the median of the list, which is used as the initial value of t.

2. The program then calculates the initial cost of changing the lengths of sticks to the median value. This is done by summing up the absolute differences between each stick length and the median value.

3. The program then iterates over all possible values of t, starting from the median value minus 1 and going down to 1, and from the median value plus 1 and going up to 100. For each value of t, it calculates the cost of changing the lengths of sticks to t or t + 1 (or t - 1), whichever is closer.

4. If the calculated cost is less than the current minimum cost, the program updates the minimum cost and the corresponding value of t.

5. Finally, the program prints the value of t and the minimum cost.

The program correctly handles all possible cases because it checks all possible values of t and calculates the cost of changing the lengths of sticks to each value of t. It also correctly handles the case where the initial median value is the optimal value of t.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
