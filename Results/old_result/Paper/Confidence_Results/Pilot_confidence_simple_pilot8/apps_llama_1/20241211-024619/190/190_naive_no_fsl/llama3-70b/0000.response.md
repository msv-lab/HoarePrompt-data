Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. 

One potential issue with the program is that it only checks for the optimal `t` value in the range from `mid - 1` to `0` and from `mid + 1` to `100`. However, the optimal `t` value could be `mid - 1` or `mid + 1`, which are not checked.

Another issue is that the program uses the median of the stick lengths as the initial `t` value. However, the optimal `t` value may not be the median, especially when the stick lengths are not uniformly distributed.

A correct program should check all possible `t` values, not just the ones around the median. It should also consider the case where the optimal `t` value is `mid - 1` or `mid + 1`.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will output `3 6`, but the correct output should be `3 2` or `4 2`. 

To fix the program, we need to check all possible `t` values and calculate the minimum cost for each `t` value. We can do this by iterating over all possible `t` values and calculating the cost for each `t` value.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    min_t = None
    for t in range(1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - t), abs(x - (t + 1)), abs(x - (t - 1))) for x in sticks)
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = t
    print(min_t, min_cost)
```
This corrected program checks all possible `t` values and calculates the minimum cost for each `t` value, ensuring that it finds the optimal solution for every potential case.
