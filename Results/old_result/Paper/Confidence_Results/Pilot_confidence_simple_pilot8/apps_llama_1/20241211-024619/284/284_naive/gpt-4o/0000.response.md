Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is designed to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis, which states that there exists a positive integer n such that for each positive integer m, the number n*m + 1 is a prime number. The program takes an input n and iterates over possible values of m from 1 to 1000. For each m, it checks if n*m + 1 is a prime number using the function func_1. If it finds an m for which n*m + 1 is not prime, it prints that m and breaks the loop.

The function func_1 checks if a number x is prime by first handling the special cases where x is less than or equal to 1 (not prime) or less than or equal to 3 (prime). It then checks if x is divisible by 2 or 3, in which case it's not prime. For larger numbers, it checks divisibility by numbers of the form 6k Â± 1 (since all primes are of this form), starting from 5 and incrementing by 6 each time, up to the square root of x. If x is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime.

The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis. It checks all possible values of m up to 1000 and uses a correct primality test. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. 

For example, when n = 3, the program outputs m = 1 because 3*1 + 1 = 4, which is not prime. When n = 4, the program outputs m = 2 because 4*1 + 1 = 5 is prime, but 4*2 + 1 = 9 is not prime.

Since the program correctly handles all the provided examples and implements the correct logic to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis, it is considered correct.
