Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses a function `func_1` before it is defined. In Python, the code is executed line by line, so when the `for` loop tries to call `func_1`, it hasn't been defined yet, resulting in a `NameError`. 

To fix this, the function `func_1` should be defined before the `for` loop. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break
```

This corrected code should work as expected and find a counterexample for any given `n`. It checks each `m` from 1 to 1000 and prints the first `m` for which `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.
