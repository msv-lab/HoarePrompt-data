Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for divisors of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` as potential candidates for `k`. However, the problem statement does not restrict `k` to be a divisor of `|a - b|`. 

A counterexample can be found when `a = 4` and `b = 9`. The program will return `k = 1`, but the optimal solution is `k = 2`, which results in a smaller LCM.

The program should check all possible values of `k` to find the smallest one that results in the smallest LCM of `a + k` and `b + k`. However, due to the large range of `a` and `b` (up to `10^9`), checking all possible values of `k` is not feasible. 

A correct approach would be to find the smallest `k` such that `a + k` and `b + k` have the same remainder when divided by their GCD. This can be achieved by calculating the GCD of `a` and `b` and then finding the smallest `k` that makes `a + k` and `b + k` multiples of their GCD. 

The given program does not implement this approach and therefore does not work correctly for all potential cases.
