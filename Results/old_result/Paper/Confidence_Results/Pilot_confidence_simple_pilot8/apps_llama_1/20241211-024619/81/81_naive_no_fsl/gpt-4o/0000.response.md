Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly calculates the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r, where GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y. 

Here's why:

1. The program first checks if y is a multiple of x. If not, it returns 0, as there can't be any good pairs.

2. It then calculates z = y // x, which represents the number that a and b must multiply to, after dividing by their GCD.

3. The program then iterates over all possible factors of z, which correspond to the possible values of a and b (after dividing by x).

4. For each factor i of z, it calculates the corresponding values of a and b as i * x and z // i * x, respectively.

5. If both a and b are within the given range [l, r], and their GCD is x and LCM is y, it increments the count. If a and b are different, it increments the count by 2, as both (a, b) and (b, a) are considered good pairs.

6. Finally, the program returns the total count of good pairs.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

- When y is not a multiple of x.
- When there are no good pairs within the given range.
- When there are good pairs, but they are not within the given range.
- When a and b are the same.
- When a and b are different.

The code also correctly handles the examples provided, and it should work correctly for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
