Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks pairs of integers (a, b) where a ≤ b, due to the line `for b in range(a, r + 1):`. However, the problem description states that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b, which means the program should also check pairs where a > b.

For example, if the input is `1 2 1 2`, the program will only check the pair (1, 2) and not (2, 1), even though both pairs are considered good pairs according to the problem description. As a result, the program will output `1` instead of the correct answer `2`.

To fix this issue, the program should check all possible pairs of integers (a, b) in the range [l, r], regardless of whether a ≤ b or a > b. This can be achieved by changing the line `for b in range(a, r + 1):` to `for b in range(l, r + 1):`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
```
