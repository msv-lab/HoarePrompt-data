Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies in the `func_2` and `func_3` functions. 

In `func_2`, the function is supposed to calculate the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready at a given position `(X, Y)`. However, the function is currently calculating the time for the meat at position `(x, y)` (which is the position of the heat source in the loop of `func_3`) instead of using the positions of all meats. 

In `func_3`, the function is trying to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. However, the function is currently iterating over all integer positions in the range `[-1000, 1000]` for both `x` and `y` coordinates, which is not sufficient to find the optimal position. The problem statement allows `X` and `Y` to be real numbers, but the function is only considering integer values.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the time for each piece of meat at the given position `(X, Y)` and then finding the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. This could be achieved by using a more sophisticated optimization algorithm that can handle real numbers, such as a gradient descent algorithm or a grid search algorithm with a finer grid.

For example, if we have two pieces of meat at positions `(0, 0)` and `(1, 0)` with hardness `1` and `2` respectively, and we want to have both pieces ready, the optimal position for the heat source would be at `(0.5, 0)`, which is not an integer position. The current implementation would not be able to find this optimal position.
