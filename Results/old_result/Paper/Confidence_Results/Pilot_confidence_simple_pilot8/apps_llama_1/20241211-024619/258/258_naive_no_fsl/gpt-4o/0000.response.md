Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It uses a binary search approach to find the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1.  The `func_1` function checks if it's possible to have K or more pieces of meat ready within a given time `T`. It iterates over all pairs of meat pieces and calculates the midpoint and the point on the line segment between the two pieces that is closest to the heat source. It then checks if the number of pieces that can be cooked within time `T` is greater than or equal to K.
2.  The `func_2` function performs a binary search over the possible range of times to find the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready.
3.  The `func_3` function reads the input data, calls `func_2` to calculate the minimum time, and prints the result.

The program handles all the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the range of input values and the condition that no two pieces of meat have the same coordinates.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The binary search approach ensures that the program finds the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready, and the `func_1` function correctly checks if it's possible to cook the required number of pieces within a given time.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
