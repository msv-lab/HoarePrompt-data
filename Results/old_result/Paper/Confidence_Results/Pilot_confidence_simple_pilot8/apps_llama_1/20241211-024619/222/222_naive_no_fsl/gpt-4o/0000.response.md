Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. The logic behind the program is to turn over every `(2 * k + 1)`th skewer, starting from the first one. This approach ensures that all skewers are turned over, as the range of skewers affected by each turn overlaps with the next turn.

The program uses a while loop to generate the positions of the skewers that need to be turned over, and it prints the number of actions needed and the positions of the skewers to be turned over.

The program handles the problem description correctly for every potential case. It takes into account the number of skewers `n` and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step `k`. The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` is less than or equal to `2 * k + 1`, in which case it will turn over all skewers in a single action.

The provided examples in the problem description are also handled correctly by the program. For instance, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `2` and `1 6`, which is a correct solution. Similarly, when `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the program outputs `2` and `1 4`, which is also a correct solution.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem.
