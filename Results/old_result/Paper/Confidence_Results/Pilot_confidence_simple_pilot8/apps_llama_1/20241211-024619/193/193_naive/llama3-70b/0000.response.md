Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting and ending side lengths of the equilateral triangle, which is not the correct approach to find the minimum number of seconds required to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y.

The problem statement allows for the modification of a single side of the triangle in each second, and the length of each side should be an integer. The program does not take into account the fact that the triangle must remain non-degenerate (i.e., have a positive area) after each modification.

For example, if the input is 6 and 3, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 4, as shown in the example in the problem statement: (6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3).

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible states of the triangle and find the shortest path to the target state. However, the given program does not implement this approach and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.
