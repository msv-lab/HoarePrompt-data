Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that it simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting and ending side lengths, which is not the minimum number of seconds required to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y.

For example, if the input is 22 4, the program will output 18, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 6, as shown in the example in the problem description. The correct steps are: (22,22,22) → (7,22,22) → (7,22,16) → (7,10,16) → (7,10,4) → (7,4,4) → (4,4,4).

This shows that the program does not handle the case where the optimal solution involves changing the length of a side to a value that is not the target length, but rather an intermediate value that allows for further changes to reach the target length. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
