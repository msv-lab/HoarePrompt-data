Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks the conditions specified in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works as expected:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by initializing `curr_lat` to 90, representing the North Pole.

2. **Direction Updates**: The program then iterates over each instruction, updating `curr_lat` based on the direction and distance traveled. The conversion factor `111.195` is used to convert kilometers to degrees of latitude.

3. **Boundary Checks**: After each update, the program checks if `curr_lat` is within the valid range of -90 to 90. If it exceeds this range, the program prints 'NO' and exits.

4. **Pole Checks**: The program also checks if Limak is at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`) or the South Pole (`curr_lat == -90`) and if the direction is valid at these poles. If the direction is invalid, the program prints 'NO' and exits.

5. **Final Check**: After all instructions have been processed, the program checks if Limak has returned to the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`). If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program handles all the examples provided in the problem description correctly and does not contain any obvious errors. It also correctly checks for all the conditions specified in the problem description, including the direction constraints at the poles and the requirement to end at the North Pole. 

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
