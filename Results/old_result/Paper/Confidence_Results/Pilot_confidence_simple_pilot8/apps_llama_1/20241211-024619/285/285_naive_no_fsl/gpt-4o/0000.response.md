Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers that do not exceed the initial game-coin score `n`. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program starts by iterating over all possible numbers of houses that can be bought, from 0 to `n // house_cost`. This ensures that all possible combinations of houses are considered.

2. For each number of houses, it calculates the remaining game-coins after buying the houses.

3. Then, it iterates over all possible numbers of cars that can be bought with the remaining game-coins, from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. This ensures that all possible combinations of houses and cars are considered.

4. For each combination of houses and cars, it calculates the remaining game-coins after buying the cars.

5. Finally, it checks if the remaining game-coins can be spent on computers by checking if `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`. If it is, the program returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to spend all the initial game-coins on houses, cars, and computers.

The program correctly handles all possible cases by checking all combinations of houses, cars, and computers that do not exceed the initial game-coin score `n`. It also correctly handles the case where `n` is not divisible by any of the costs, in which case it returns 'NO'.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For the input `1359257`, the program correctly returns 'YES' because one possible solution is to buy one house, one car, and one computer, spending `1234567 + 123456 + 1234 = 1359257` game-coins in total. For the input `17851817`, the program correctly returns 'NO' because there is no combination of houses, cars, and computers that sums up to `17851817`. 

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
