Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine whether Kolya could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. It iterates over all possible combinations of houses and cars that can be bought, and for each combination, it checks if the remaining amount can be spent on computers.

The program uses the following logic:

1. It calculates the maximum number of houses that can be bought with the initial amount `n`.
2. For each possible number of houses, it calculates the remaining amount after buying those houses.
3. It then calculates the maximum number of cars that can be bought with the remaining amount.
4. For each possible number of cars, it calculates the remaining amount after buying those cars.
5. If the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer, it returns 'YES', indicating that Kolya could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.

The program covers all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers, and it correctly checks if the remaining amount can be spent on computers. Therefore, it should work correctly for all possible inputs.

The time complexity of the program is O(n^2), where n is the initial amount. This is because it uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of houses and cars. However, this is acceptable given the constraints of the problem, where n is at most 10^9.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
