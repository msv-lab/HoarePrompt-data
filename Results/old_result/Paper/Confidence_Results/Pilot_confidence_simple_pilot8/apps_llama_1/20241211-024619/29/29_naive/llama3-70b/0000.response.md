Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the required functionality. It simply sorts the files based on their types and then tries to move each file to its corresponding position. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that some files may already be at their correct positions, and moving them would be unnecessary. Moreover, the program does not handle the case where a file is being moved to a position that is already occupied by another file.

A correct implementation would need to consider the following:

1. Identify the files that are already at their correct positions and do not need to be moved.
2. For files that need to be moved, check if the target position is already occupied by another file. If it is, then the program would need to move the file at the target position to a temporary position before moving the original file to the target position.

Here is an example of an input where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
3
1 1
2 0
3 1
```
The program will output:
```
3
move 1 1
move 3 2
move 2 3
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
1
move 2 3
```
Because the files "1" and "3" are already at their correct positions, and only the file "2" needs to be moved.
