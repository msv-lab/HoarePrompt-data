Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply counts the number of positions in the permutation `p` that are not equal to their index plus one, and the number of zeros in the sequence `b`. However, this approach does not take into account the actual cycles in the permutation and the effect of the sequence `b` on these cycles.

A correct approach would involve finding the cycles in the permutation `p` and checking if each cycle can be traversed in both directions by changing some elements in `p` and `b`. The program should also consider the minimum number of changes required to achieve this.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0
```
The program will output `8`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1`, because we can change one element in `b` to `1` to make the skewers visit each position in both directions.

The program does not handle this case correctly, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
