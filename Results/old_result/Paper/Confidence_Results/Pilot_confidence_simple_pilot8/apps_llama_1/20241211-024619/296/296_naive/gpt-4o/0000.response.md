Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`. The program simply generates all divisors of `n` and creates fractions with numerator 1 and these divisors as denominators. However, the sum of these fractions is not necessarily equal to `1 - 1/n`.

For example, when `n = 6`, the program correctly outputs `YES` and the sequence `1/2, 1/3`, which sums up to `1 - 1/6`. However, when `n = 5`, the program outputs `YES` and the sequence `1/5`, which does not sum up to `1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. The correct output for `n = 5` should be `NO`, because there is no sequence of fractions with denominators dividing `5` that sums up to `4/5`.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to find a sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n`, which requires a more complex algorithm than simply generating all divisors of `n`. The program should check all possible combinations of fractions with denominators dividing `n` and numerators less than the denominators, and find a combination that sums up to `1 - 1/n`. If no such combination is found, the program should output `NO`.
