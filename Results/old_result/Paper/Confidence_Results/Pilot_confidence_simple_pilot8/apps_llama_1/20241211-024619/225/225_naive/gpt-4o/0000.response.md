Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels. 

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. It initializes a set of vowels and a variable `max_jump` to 1, which will store the maximum jump length required.
2. It iterates over the string, and whenever it encounters a vowel, it updates `max_jump` with the maximum of its current value and the distance between the current vowel and the previous one.
3. After the loop, it updates `max_jump` one more time with the maximum of its current value and the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string.
4. Finally, it returns `max_jump`, which is the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string.

The program handles all edge cases correctly:

- If the string starts with a vowel, `prev_pos` is updated correctly in the first iteration.
- If the string ends with a vowel, the last update of `max_jump` after the loop ensures that the distance to the end of the string is considered.
- If the string contains no vowels, `max_jump` will still be updated correctly to the length of the string, because `prev_pos` will remain -1 throughout the loop, and the final update will set `max_jump` to the length of the string.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
