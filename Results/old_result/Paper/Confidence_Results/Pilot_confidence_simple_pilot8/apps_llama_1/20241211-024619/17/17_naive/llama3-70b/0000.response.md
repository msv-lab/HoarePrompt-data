Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The condition `if cnt3 > cnt1` is not sufficient to determine whether a regular bracket sequence can be formed. 

A correct approach would be to check if the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets, and if the number of closing brackets at any point does not exceed the number of opening brackets. 

For example, if `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 0`, and `cnt4 = 1`, the program will print `1`, but it should print `0` because the resulting bracket sequence `(( ))` is not regular.

A correct solution would be:

```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3 + cnt4 == 0:
        print(1)
    elif cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4:
        if cnt3 <= cnt1 + cnt2:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(0)
    else:
        print(0)
```
