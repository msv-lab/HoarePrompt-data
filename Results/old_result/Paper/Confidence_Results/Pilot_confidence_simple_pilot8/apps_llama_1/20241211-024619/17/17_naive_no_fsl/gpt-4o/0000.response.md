Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately checks the conditions required to form a regular bracket sequence from the given strings.

To form a regular bracket sequence, we need to ensure that the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets. This is achieved when `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4`, as `cnt1` and `cnt3` represent the number of strings with an extra opening bracket, and `cnt2` and `cnt4` represent the number of strings with an extra closing bracket.

Additionally, to ensure that the sequence is regular, we need to make sure that we can insert the strings in such a way that the brackets are balanced at every step. This is possible if `cnt2 >= cnt3`, because we can insert the `cnt2` strings with a balanced bracket pair before inserting the `cnt3` strings with an unbalanced bracket pair.

The program checks both conditions and prints 1 if they are met, indicating that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence. Otherwise, it prints 0.

The examples provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program:

* In the first example, `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` and `cnt2 >= cnt3`, so the program correctly prints 1.
* In the second example, `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` and `cnt2 >= cnt3` (since all counts are 0), so the program correctly prints 1.
* In the third example, `cnt1 + cnt2!= cnt3 + cnt4`, so the program correctly prints 0.

After analyzing the program and the problem description, I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
