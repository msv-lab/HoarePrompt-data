Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program seems to correctly calculate the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- `max_asked` is calculated as `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`, which represents the maximum number of times a pupil can be asked. This is because the teacher asks pupils in a zigzag pattern, and the maximum number of questions a pupil can receive is when the teacher has asked `k` questions and the pupil is in the row that is asked the most.

- `min_asked` is calculated as `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`, which represents the minimum number of times a pupil can be asked. This is because the minimum number of questions a pupil can receive is when the teacher has asked `k` questions and the pupil is in the row that is asked the least.

- `sergei_asked` is calculated as `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`, which represents the number of times Sergei is asked. This is because Sergei's row is asked every `2 * n` questions, and the teacher asks Sergei when his row is asked and his position in the row is reached.

The program's logic seems to correctly handle all possible cases, including edge cases such as when there is only one row or when Sergei is in the first or last row. The program also correctly handles large inputs, as demonstrated by the example with `n = 100`, `m = 100`, and `k = 1000000000000000000`. 

Therefore, based on the provided program and the problem description, it appears that the program is correct and handles all possible cases.
