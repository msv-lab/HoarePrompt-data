Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It accurately calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

The program first calculates the number of full cycles and remaining questions. It then determines the minimum and maximum number of questions based on the number of full cycles and the position of the pupil. The program also correctly handles the case when there is only one row in the class.

The program then simulates the remaining questions and updates the maximum number of questions and the number of times Sergei is asked accordingly.

I have analyzed the program and could not find any potential case where it does not follow the problem description. The program correctly handles different inputs and edge cases, such as when there is only one row in the class or when Sergei is in the first or last row.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For instance, in the first example, the program correctly outputs 3, 2, and 3, which matches the expected output. Similarly, in the second example, the program correctly outputs 2, 1, and 1, which matches the expected output.

Overall, based on my analysis, I believe that the program is correct and accurately implements the problem description.
