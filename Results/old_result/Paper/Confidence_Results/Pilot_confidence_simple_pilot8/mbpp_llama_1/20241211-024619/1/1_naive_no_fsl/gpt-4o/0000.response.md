Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately finds the shared elements from two given lists. The function `func_1` converts the input lists to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements, and then uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives the common elements. The result is then converted back to a tuple and sorted.

The use of sets to find the common elements is efficient and effective, and the conversion to a tuple and sorting ensures that the output is in a consistent and predictable format.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including cases where there are multiple common elements and cases where the common elements are not in the same order in the two input lists.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists with no common elements correctly, as these cases will result in an empty tuple being returned. 

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))`, the function will correctly return `()`, which is an empty tuple, indicating that there are no common elements between the two lists. 

Overall, the program is well-designed and correctly implements the desired functionality.
