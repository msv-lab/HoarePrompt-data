Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list. The function uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which sorts the elements of the list in ascending order. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the three input lists into a single list, which is then passed to the `sorted` function.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: If any of the input lists are empty, the function will still work correctly and return a sorted list of the non-empty lists.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function will sort the lists correctly even if there are duplicate elements in the lists.
- Lists with negative numbers: The function will sort the lists correctly even if the lists contain negative numbers.
- Lists with strings: If the lists contain strings, the function will sort them lexicographically.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [0, 7, 8])`, the function will return `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, which is the correct sorted list.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
