Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The `math.hypot(x, y)` function calculates the Euclidean distance from the origin, which is the radial distance `r` in polar coordinates. The `math.atan2(y, x)` function calculates the angle `phi` in radians, taking into account the quadrant of the point `(x, y)`. 

The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error. It also correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are both zero, returning `0` for `r` and `0` for `phi`.

The function correctly handles all possible input cases, including points in all four quadrants, points on the axes, and the origin. It does not have any obvious edge cases that are not handled correctly. 

For example, if we call `func_1(3, 4)`, the function correctly returns the polar coordinates of the point `(3, 4)`, which is approximately `(5.0, 0.9272952180016122)`. 

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible input cases.
