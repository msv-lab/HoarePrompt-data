Correctness: **True**.

The given program is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and applies the built-in `sorted` function with a `key` argument set to `str.lower`. This ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program iterates over each sublist in the list of lists, which covers all potential sublists.
2. The `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` sorts the strings in each sublist in a case-insensitive manner, which meets the problem description.
3. The program returns a new list of lists with the sorted sublists, leaving the original list unchanged.

To verify the correctness, consider the following examples:

* Input: `[["hello", "World"], ["apple", "Banana"]]`
Output: `[["hello", "World"], ["apple", "Banana"]]` (correctly sorted in a case-insensitive manner)
* Input: `[["Zebra", "cat"], ["dog", "Elephant"]]`
Output: `[["cat", "Zebra"], ["dog", "Elephant"]]` (correctly sorted in a case-insensitive manner)
* Input: `[["", "a"], ["b", ""]]`
Output: `[["", "a"], ["", "b"]]` (correctly sorted in a case-insensitive manner)

After analyzing the program and considering various examples, it appears that the program works correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
