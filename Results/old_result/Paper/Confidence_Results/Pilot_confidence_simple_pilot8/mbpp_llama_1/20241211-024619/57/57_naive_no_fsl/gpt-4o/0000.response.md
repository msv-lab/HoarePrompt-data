Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order.

The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and applies the built-in `sorted` function to sort the strings in each sublist. The sorted sublists are then collected into a new list, which is returned as the result.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program for various inputs, including lists with different lengths and containing different strings. The program handles these cases correctly and produces the expected output.

After analyzing the program and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles:

* Sublists with different lengths
* Sublists containing different strings
* Sublists with duplicate strings
* Empty sublists (although not explicitly tested, the program would correctly return an empty sublist in such cases)

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
