Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(nums)` checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted or not by comparing the original list with its sorted version. This approach is correct because the `sorted()` function in Python returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. If the original list is already sorted, then it will be equal to its sorted version, and the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
- Lists with a single element: A list with a single element is considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
- Lists that are already sorted: The function will return `True` for lists that are already sorted in ascending order.
- Lists that are not sorted: The function will return `False` for lists that are not sorted in ascending order.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function will work correctly even if the list contains duplicate elements.
- Lists with negative numbers or zero: The function will work correctly for lists that contain negative numbers or zero.

Overall, the function is correct and will work as expected for all potential cases.
