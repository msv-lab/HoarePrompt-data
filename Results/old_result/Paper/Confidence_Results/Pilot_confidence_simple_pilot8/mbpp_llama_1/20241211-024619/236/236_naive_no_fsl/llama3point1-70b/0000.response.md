Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns `True` if the list is sorted, and `False` otherwise.

Here's why the program is correct:

- The `sorted()` function in Python returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. 
- The `==` operator checks if the two lists are equal.
- If the input list `nums` is already sorted, then `sorted(nums)` will return the same list, and `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True`.
- If the input list `nums` is not sorted, then `sorted(nums)` will return a different list, and `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `False`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the program correctly returns `True`.
- Lists with one element: A list with one element is considered sorted, and the program correctly returns `True`.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The program correctly handles lists with duplicate elements.
- Lists with negative numbers: The program correctly handles lists with negative numbers.

Since the program works correctly for all potential cases, its correctness is **True**.
