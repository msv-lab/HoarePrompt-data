Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. The function `func_1` iterates over the list, comparing each element with its next element. If it finds any pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the iteration without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Lists with duplicate elements
* Lists with negative numbers
* Lists with floating-point numbers
* Empty lists (although this case is not explicitly tested, the function will return `True` for an empty list, which is correct since an empty list is considered sorted)
* Lists with a single element (although this case is not explicitly tested, the function will return `True` for a list with a single element, which is correct since a list with a single element is considered sorted)

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program, as they cover different scenarios, including sorted and unsorted lists. Since we cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected, the program is correct.
