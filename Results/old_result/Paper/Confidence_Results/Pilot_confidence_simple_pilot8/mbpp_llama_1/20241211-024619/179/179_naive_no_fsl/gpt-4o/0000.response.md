Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function works as follows:

1. It generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
2. It calculates the cube of each number in the list using a generator expression: `(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
3. It sums up the cubes of these numbers using the built-in `sum` function.

The function correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, and `assert func_1(4) == 800`, demonstrate the function's correctness for specific inputs.

Upon analyzing the code, it is evident that the function will work correctly for any positive integer `n`, as it correctly generates the first `n` even natural numbers and calculates the sum of their cubes. The use of list comprehension and generator expression ensures efficient computation.

Since the function correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, it is considered correct.
