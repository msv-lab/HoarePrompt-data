Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. The `zip(*tuples)` expression unpacks the input tuple of tuples and transposes it, so that the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input tuples.
2. The `sum(val)` expression calculates the sum of the values in each transposed tuple.
3. The `len(tuples)` expression returns the number of input tuples, which is used as the divisor to calculate the average.
4. The list comprehension `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` combines the above steps to calculate the average of the corresponding values from each tuple and returns the result as a list.

This program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty input tuples: The program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to calculate the average of an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
* Tuples with different lengths: The program will raise a `ValueError` when trying to unpack tuples with different lengths, which is the expected behavior.
* Tuples with non-numeric values: The program will raise a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the sum of non-numeric values, which is the expected behavior.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
