Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly splits a list for every nth element and returns a list of the resulting lists. The function utilizes list slicing (`lst[i::n]`) to create new lists, starting from each index `i` in the range of `n`, and stepping by `n`. This approach ensures that the original list is split into `n` sublists, each containing every nth element.

The function handles various edge cases correctly:

1.  When `n` is 1, it returns a list containing the original list, as expected.
2.  When `n` is equal to the length of the list, it returns a list containing `n` sublists, each with one element.
3.  When `n` is greater than the length of the list, it returns a list containing sublists with fewer elements, as expected.
4.  When the list is empty, it returns an empty list.

Here are some example use cases:

```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2))  # Output: [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3))  # Output: [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 1))  # Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]
print(func_1([], 2))  # Output: [[], []]
print(func_1([1, 2, 3], 5))  # Output: [[1], [2], [3], [], []]
```

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected, and no incorrect results are produced. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
