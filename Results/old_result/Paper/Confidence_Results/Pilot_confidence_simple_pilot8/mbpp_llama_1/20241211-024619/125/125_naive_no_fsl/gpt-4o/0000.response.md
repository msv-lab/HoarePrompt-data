Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly splits a list into sublists for every nth element. It utilizes list comprehension to initialize a list of empty lists (`result`) with a length of `n`, where `n` is the specified interval. Then, it iterates over the input list (`lst`) using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `element` of each item. 

For each element, it calculates the index of the sublist where the element should be appended using the modulo operator (`i % n`). This ensures that elements at indices 0, `n`, 2`n`, etc., are appended to the first sublist; elements at indices 1, `n+1`, 2`n+1`, etc., are appended to the second sublist; and so on.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

- Lists of different lengths and types (e.g., strings, integers)
- Different values of `n`, including cases where `n` is greater than the length of the list
- Edge cases, such as an empty list or `n` equal to 1

Since the function's logic is sound and it handles various scenarios correctly, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
