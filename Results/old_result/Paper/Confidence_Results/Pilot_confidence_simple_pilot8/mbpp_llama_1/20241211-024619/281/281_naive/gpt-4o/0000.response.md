Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. For each number, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). If the condition is true, the number is included in the output list.

This approach correctly identifies even numbers because, by definition, an even number is an integer that is exactly divisible by 2, which is precisely what the condition `num % 2 == 0` checks.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only even numbers, and lists with a mix of positive and zero numbers. The function correctly returns all even numbers from these lists.

Given the logic and the unit tests, there is no apparent case where the function would fail to correctly identify even numbers from a list of numbers. Therefore, the function is considered correct based on the provided problem description and examples.
