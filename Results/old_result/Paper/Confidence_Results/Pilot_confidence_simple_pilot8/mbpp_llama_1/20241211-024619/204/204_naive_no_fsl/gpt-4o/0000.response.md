Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1` uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. This set includes the months January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are the months that have 31 days in the Gregorian calendar.

The function then checks if the input month is in this set, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise. This approach correctly handles all possible month numbers from 1 to 12.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program, as they cover various cases, including months with 31 days (e.g., May, January, December) and months without 31 days (e.g., February, June, November). The program passes all these tests, indicating that it works as expected.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and there are no apparent edge cases that it does not handle, the correctness of the program is **True**.
