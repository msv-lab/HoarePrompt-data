Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(s)` checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. It splits the input string into words and then iterates over each word. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the middle of the word (i.e., `word[1:-1]`). If it finds such a word, it immediately returns `True`. If it doesn't find any such word after checking all words, it returns `False`.

This function correctly handles all potential cases:

- It correctly handles single-word strings and multi-word strings.
- It correctly handles words with 'z' at the start, end, or in the middle.
- It correctly handles words without 'z'.
- It correctly handles empty strings and strings with only one character.
- It correctly handles strings with multiple spaces between words.

The function's logic is sound, and it should work as expected for all possible inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
