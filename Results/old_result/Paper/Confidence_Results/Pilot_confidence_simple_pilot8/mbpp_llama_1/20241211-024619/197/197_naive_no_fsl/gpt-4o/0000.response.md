Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list, counting its occurrences in the tuple using the `count` method. The `sum` function then adds up these counts to give the total number of occurrences.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

- Counting occurrences of multiple elements: The function correctly counts the occurrences of all elements in the list, not just the first one.
- Handling duplicate elements in the list: The function counts the occurrences of each element in the list separately, even if the list contains duplicates.
- Handling elements not present in the tuple: The `count` method returns 0 for elements not present in the tuple, so these do not affect the total count.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs. 

Overall, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
