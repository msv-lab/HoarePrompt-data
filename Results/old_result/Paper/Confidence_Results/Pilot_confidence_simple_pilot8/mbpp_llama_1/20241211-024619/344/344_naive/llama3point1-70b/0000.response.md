Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. It iterates through the sorted list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element is found, it returns the length of the sorted list, indicating that the value should be inserted at the end.

This function handles all potential cases correctly:

- If the value is less than all elements in the sorted list, it returns the length of the sorted list.
- If the value is equal to an element in the sorted list, it returns the index of that element.
- If the value is greater than all elements in the sorted list, it returns the length of the sorted list.
- If the value is between two elements in the sorted list, it returns the index of the first element that is greater than the value.

For example, if the sorted list is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` and the value is `6`, the function returns `3`, which is the correct insertion point to maintain the sorted order. 

The function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the sorted list, because it potentially checks every element in the list. However, this does not affect its correctness, only its efficiency. 

Overall, the function works as expected and correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
