Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function iterates over the indices of the list using a for loop.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is odd by using the condition `i % 2!= 0`.
3. If `i` is odd, it then checks if the element at index `i` is even by using the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0`.
4. If an odd index is found to contain an even number, the function immediately returns `False`.
5. If the function iterates over all indices without finding any odd index containing an even number, it returns `True`.

This logic correctly implements the problem description. The function handles all possible cases, including:

* Lists with only one element (which has an even index of 0)
* Lists with multiple elements, where some or all odd indices contain odd numbers
* Lists with multiple elements, where some or all odd indices contain even numbers

The function does not have any obvious edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the function appears to be correct.
