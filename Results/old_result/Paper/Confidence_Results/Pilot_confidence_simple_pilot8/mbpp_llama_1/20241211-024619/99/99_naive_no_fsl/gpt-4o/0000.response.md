Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly removes the characters at odd index values from a given string. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the string, selecting only the characters at even index values (i.e., where `i % 2 == 0`). The resulting list of characters is then joined back into a string using `''.join()`.

The function works correctly for all potential cases because it properly handles the indexing of the string. In Python, string indices start at 0, which is considered an even index. Therefore, the function will always select the first character of the string, as well as every other character at even indices.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input strings. Additionally, the function's logic is straightforward and easy to understand, making it unlikely to contain any hidden bugs or edge cases that would cause it to fail.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible input strings.
