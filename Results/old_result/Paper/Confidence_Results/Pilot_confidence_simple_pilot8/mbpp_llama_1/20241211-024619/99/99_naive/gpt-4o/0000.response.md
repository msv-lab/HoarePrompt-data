Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to remove characters at odd index values from a given string. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the string and includes characters at even index values (i.e., where `i % 2 == 0`) in the resulting string.

The function works correctly for all potential cases because it accurately implements the described behavior. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'`, `assert func_1('python') == 'pto'`, `assert func_1('data') == 'dt'`, and `assert func_1('lambs') == 'lms'`, demonstrate the function's correctness for various input strings.

In Python, string indices start at 0, which is considered an even index. Therefore, the function correctly includes characters at indices 0, 2, 4, and so on, in the resulting string, effectively removing characters at odd index values.

Since the function behaves as expected for all provided test cases and its logic is sound, it is correct. There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to deviate from its intended behavior.
