Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The code iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and value of each element. If it finds a match between the current element and the target element, it immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If it iterates through the entire array without finding a match, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1.

This solution handles all potential cases, including:

* The element is in the array: The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the correct index.
* The element is not in the array: The function returns a tuple containing `False` and -1.
* The array is empty: The function returns a tuple containing `False` and -1, which is the expected behavior.
* The element appears multiple times in the array: The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the first occurrence, which meets the problem requirements.

Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
