Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It iterates through the input array using `enumerate` to access both the index and value of each element. If the target element is found, the function immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the loop completes without finding the target element, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`, indicating that the element is not present in the array.

This implementation correctly handles all potential cases, including:

1. The target element is present in the array: The function returns `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array.
2. The target element is not present in the array: The function returns `(False, -1)`.
3. The input array is empty: Although not explicitly tested in the provided assertions, the function will correctly return `(False, -1)` for an empty array, as the loop will not find the target element and will return the default value.

Since the function correctly handles all possible cases and the provided assertions pass, the program is considered correct.
