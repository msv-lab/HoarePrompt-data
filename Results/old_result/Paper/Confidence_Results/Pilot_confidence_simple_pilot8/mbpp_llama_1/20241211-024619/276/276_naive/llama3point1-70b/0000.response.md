Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The issue lies in the calculation of the `middle_index`. The `middle_index` should be the index of the middle element in the merged list, which is `size * 2 // 2` or simply `size`, not `size - 1`. 

However, there's another issue. The problem description states that the two lists are of the same size, but the code doesn't check if the lists are sorted. If the lists are not sorted, the code will still work but the problem description implies that the lists are already sorted.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input lists are `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`. The program will return the median as `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`, which is correct. However, if we consider the lists `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]`, the program will return the median as `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which is correct. But if we consider the lists `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` and the size is `2`, the program will return the median as `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`, which is correct.

But the main issue is with the calculation of the `middle_index`. If we consider the lists `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, the merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The `middle_index` should be `2`, not `1`. 

Here is the correct code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size
    if size * 2 % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

Or more simply:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    n = len(merged_list)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[n // 2 - 1] + merged_list[n // 2]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[n // 2]
    return median
```
