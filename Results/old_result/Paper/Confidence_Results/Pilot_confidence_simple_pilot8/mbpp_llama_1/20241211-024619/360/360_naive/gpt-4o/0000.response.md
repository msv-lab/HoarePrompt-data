Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly implements the logic to find the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. It iterates over each sublist, calculates the sum of its elements, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum found so far.

Here's why the code works as expected:

1. **Initialization**: It starts with `max_sum` set to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) and `max_list` as an empty list. This ensures that the first sublist's sum will be greater than `max_sum`, allowing the function to correctly identify the first sublist as the current maximum.

2. **Iteration and Comparison**: For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements (`current_sum = sum(sublist)`). If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` with the new sum and sets `max_list` to the current sublist. This process continues until all sublists have been evaluated.

3. **Return**: Finally, it returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum of elements.

The function handles various scenarios correctly, including:

- **Single sublist**: If there's only one sublist, it correctly returns that sublist, as its sum is trivially the highest.
- **Multiple sublists with different sums**: It correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum among multiple sublists.
- **Sublists with negative numbers or zero**: The function works correctly even if the sublists contain negative numbers or zeros, as the sum calculation (`sum(sublist)`) handles these cases correctly.

Given the provided unit tests and the logic implemented in the function, there's no apparent case where the function would not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is considered correct for all potential cases.
