Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The function uses the built-in `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which calculates the sum of each sublist and returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

This program is correct because it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It works correctly for:

- Lists with positive numbers
- Lists with negative numbers
- Lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers
- Lists with duplicate maximum sums (in which case it returns one of the sublists with the maximum sum, as the `max` function returns the first maximum element it encounters)
- Empty lists (although this case is not explicitly handled, the function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list is empty, which is a reasonable behavior)

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly implements the problem description and returns the expected result for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
