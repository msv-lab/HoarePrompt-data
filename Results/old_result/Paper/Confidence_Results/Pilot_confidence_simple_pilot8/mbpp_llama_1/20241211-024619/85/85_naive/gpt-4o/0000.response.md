Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function works by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions. It then calculates the difference between these two values and returns the result.

This approach is correct because the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This is because the maximum value is the largest possible value, and the minimum value is the smallest possible value, so the difference between them will always be the largest possible difference.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. For example, in the array `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum value is `5` and the minimum value is `1`, so the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`, which is the expected result.

In general, the function will work correctly for any array of numbers, regardless of the size or the values of the elements. It will always return the maximum difference between any two elements, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Therefore, the function is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
