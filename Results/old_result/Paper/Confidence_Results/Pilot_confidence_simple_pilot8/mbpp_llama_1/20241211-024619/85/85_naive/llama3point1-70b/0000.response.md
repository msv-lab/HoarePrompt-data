Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(arr)` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by simply subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach is correct because it covers all possible pairs of elements in the array.

Here's why it works:

- The `max(arr)` function returns the largest element in the array.
- The `min(arr)` function returns the smallest element in the array.
- Subtracting the smallest element from the largest element gives the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array.

This function handles all edge cases correctly, including:

- Empty arrays: If the input array is empty, `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` will both raise a `ValueError`, indicating that the function cannot operate on an empty array. However, the problem description does not specify what to do in this case, so it's up to the programmer to decide how to handle this edge case.
- Arrays with a single element: If the input array contains only one element, `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` will both return that element, resulting in a difference of 0, which is correct.
- Arrays with duplicate elements: The function will still return the correct maximum difference, as `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` will return the maximum and minimum unique elements in the array, respectively.

Overall, the function is correct and will work as expected for all valid input arrays.
