Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if a given array of integers contains any duplicate element by iterating through the array and adding each element to a set. If an element is already present in the set, it means that the element is a duplicate, and the function returns `True`. If the function iterates through the entire array without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

The use of a set to keep track of seen elements is efficient because it allows for constant time complexity lookups, making the overall time complexity of the function O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates, arrays with duplicates, and arrays with multiple duplicates.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and the code seems to handle all possible edge cases, including empty arrays (although this is not explicitly tested in the provided unit tests). Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
