Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The function uses the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients in the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is equal to `2^(n-1)`.

The function `func_1(n)` simply returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is a direct implementation of this property. The provided unit tests `assert func_1(4) == 8`, `assert func_1(6) == 32`, and `assert func_1(2) == 2` validate the correctness of the function for specific inputs.

After analyzing the function and its mathematical basis, it appears that the function correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for any positive integer `n`. The function does not contain any conditional statements or loops that could potentially introduce errors for specific inputs. The mathematical property used in the function is well-established and applies to all positive integers `n`.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, it is concluded that the function `func_1(n)` is correct and works as expected for all positive integer inputs.
