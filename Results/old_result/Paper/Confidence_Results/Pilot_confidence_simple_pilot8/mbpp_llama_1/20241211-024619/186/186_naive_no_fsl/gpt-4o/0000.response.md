Correctness: **False**

The given function `func_1` does not meet the problem description. It performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two input tuples, which is not equivalent to extracting the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

A correct implementation of the function should compare each element of the two tuples and return a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding element in the first tuple is greater than the corresponding element in the second tuple, and 0 otherwise.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:
```python
print(func_1((3, 2, 5), (2, 3, 4)))  # Expected output: (1, 0, 1), Actual output: (2, 2, 4)
```
In this case, the function performs a bitwise AND operation instead of comparing the elements and returning the expected result.

A correct implementation of the function would be:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(int(a > b) for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
