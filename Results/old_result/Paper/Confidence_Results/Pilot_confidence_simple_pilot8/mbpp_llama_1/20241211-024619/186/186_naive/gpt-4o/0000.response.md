Correctness: **False**.

The given function `func_1` is supposed to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, it seems to be performing a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples, which is not the same as extracting the elementwise and tuples.

A correct implementation of the function would involve comparing corresponding elements of the two tuples and returning a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding elements in the input tuples are equal, and 0 otherwise. However, the provided function does not achieve this.

For example, if we call `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (10, 4, 6, 9))`, the function should return `(10, 4, 6, 9)`, but it actually returns `(10, 4, 6, 9)` which is correct for this case but the function is not correct in general because it performs a bitwise AND operation, not an "and" operation. 

However, the unit test `assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)` suggests that the function should return a tuple where each element is the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements in the input tuples. In this case, the function is correct, but only because the bitwise AND operation happens to produce the correct result for the given inputs.

But if we consider the problem description "Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples" then the function is not correct because it does not "extract the elementwise and tuples" but performs a bitwise AND operation.

So, the function is not correct in general because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

To fix this issue, we need to clarify the problem description to match the actual behavior of the function, or modify the function to match the problem description. 

For example, if we want the function to return a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding elements in the input tuples are equal, and 0 otherwise, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(int(a == b) for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the corresponding elements of the two tuples, compares each pair of elements, and returns a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding elements are equal, and 0 otherwise.
