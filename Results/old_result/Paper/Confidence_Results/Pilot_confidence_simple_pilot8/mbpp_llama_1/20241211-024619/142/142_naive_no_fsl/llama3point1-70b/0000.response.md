Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an `element` as input, and it checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

The `all` function in Python returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, a generator expression) are true. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding item in the list is equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* An empty list: `all` returns `True` for an empty iterable, which is the correct result because there are no items in the list that are not equal to the given element.
* A list with a single element: `all` returns `True` if the single element is equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.
* A list with multiple elements: `all` returns `True` if all elements are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the correctness of the program:
```python
print(func_1([1, 1, 1], 1))  # True
print(func_1([1, 2, 1], 1))  # False
print(func_1([], 1))  # True
print(func_1([1], 1))  # True
print(func_1([1], 2))  # False
```
Since the program correctly handles all potential cases, its correctness is **True**.
