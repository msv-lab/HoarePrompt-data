Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with `b` followed by `a`. This function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including positive and negative numbers, integers and floats, and even when the input numbers are the same. For example, `func_1(1, 2)` returns `(2, 1)`, `func_1(-3, 4)` returns `(4, -3)`, and `func_1(5.5, 6.6)` returns `(6.6, 5.5)`.

Since the program behaves as expected for all possible inputs and edge cases, it is correct. The function's simplicity and straightforward implementation make it easy to verify its correctness. There are no apparent missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling, and the function's behavior aligns with the problem description.
