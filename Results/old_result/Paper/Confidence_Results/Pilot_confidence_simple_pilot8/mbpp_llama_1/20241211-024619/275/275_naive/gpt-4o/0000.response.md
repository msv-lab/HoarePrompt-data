Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the size of the largest subset of the list such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible. The function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, which is the correct size of the largest subset in this case.

2. The function then sorts the input list in ascending order. This is done to ensure that when checking for divisibility, the smaller number is always divided into the larger number.

3. The function initializes a list `dp` of size equal to the length of the input list, where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset that ends with the `i-th` number in the sorted list. The `dp` list is initialized with all elements set to 1, which means that the largest subset ending with any number is at least of size 1 (the number itself).

4. The function then iterates over the sorted list and for each number, it checks all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by any of them. If it is, the function updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j]` (where `j` is the index of the previous number) plus 1. This is because if the current number is divisible by the previous number, we can extend the subset ending with the previous number by adding the current number to it.

5. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest subset of the input list such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the function works correctly for different inputs. After analyzing the code and the unit tests, I couldn't find any case where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.
