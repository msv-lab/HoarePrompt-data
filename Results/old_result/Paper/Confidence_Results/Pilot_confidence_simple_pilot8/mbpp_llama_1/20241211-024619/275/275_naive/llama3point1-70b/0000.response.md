Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It sorts the input list `nums` and then uses dynamic programming to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible.

The function initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `i`. It then iterates over the list, updating `dp[i]` if it finds a previous number `nums[j]` such that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. The maximum value in `dp` is then returned as the size of the largest subset.

This approach ensures that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible, as required by the problem description. The function also handles edge cases correctly, such as an empty input list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 4, 8]`, the function will return `4`, which is the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible. If the input list is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, the function will return `1`, which is the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible (in this case, each number is only divisible by itself).

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
