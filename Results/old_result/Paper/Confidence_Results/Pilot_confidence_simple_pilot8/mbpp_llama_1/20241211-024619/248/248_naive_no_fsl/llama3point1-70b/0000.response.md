Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately converts a list to a tuple for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes an input list and returns a tuple version of that list using the built-in `tuple()` function in Python. This function works correctly for lists of any size, including empty lists, and for lists containing any type of elements, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists or tuples.

Here are some examples of how the function works correctly:
- For an empty list: `func_1([])` returns `()`
- For a list of integers: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 3)`
- For a list of strings: `func_1(["a", "b", "c"])` returns `('a', 'b', 'c')`
- For a list containing mixed types: `func_1([1, "a", 3.5])` returns `(1, 'a', 3.5)`
- For a list containing nested lists: `func_1([1, [2, 3], 4])` returns `(1, [2, 3], 4)`

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Since no case can be found where the program does not work as expected, the program is considered correct.
