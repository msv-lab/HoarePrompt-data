Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases. It handles dictionaries with any number of key-value pairs, and it correctly filters out the pairs where the value is less than `n`. It also handles cases where `n` is greater than, less than, or equal to all the values in the dictionary.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, when `n` is 170, the function correctly returns a dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to 170. Similarly, when `n` is 180 or 190, the function correctly filters out the pairs where the value is less than `n`.

Overall, the function `func_1` is correct and works as expected. It correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`, and it handles all potential cases.
