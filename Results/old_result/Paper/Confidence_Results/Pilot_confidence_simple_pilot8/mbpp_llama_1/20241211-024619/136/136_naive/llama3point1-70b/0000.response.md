Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly filters the input dictionary `d` to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. This is achieved through a dictionary comprehension that iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary and only includes the pair in the resulting dictionary if the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty dictionaries: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with no values greater than or equal to `n`: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with all values greater than or equal to `n`: The function will return the original dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with a mix of values greater than or equal to `n` and values less than `n`: The function will return a dictionary containing only the key-value pairs with values greater than or equal to `n`, which is the expected result.

The function also handles edge cases, such as when `n` is a very large or very small number, correctly.

Overall, the function correctly implements the described behavior and handles all potential cases, making it a correct solution.
