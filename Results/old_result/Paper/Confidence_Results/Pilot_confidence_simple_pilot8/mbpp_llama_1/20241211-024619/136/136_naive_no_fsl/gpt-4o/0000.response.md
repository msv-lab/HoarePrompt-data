Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The function `func_1` uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary `d`. It checks if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`, and if so, includes the key-value pair in the resulting dictionary.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program for various inputs and values of `n`. The function correctly handles cases where `n` is less than, equal to, or greater than the values in the dictionary.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code is concise and effectively implements the required functionality, making it correct for all possible inputs.
