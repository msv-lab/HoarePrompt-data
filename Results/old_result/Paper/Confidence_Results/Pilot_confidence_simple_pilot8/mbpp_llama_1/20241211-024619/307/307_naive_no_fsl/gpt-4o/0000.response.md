Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` appears to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function uses a simple iterative approach, generating triangular numbers and checking their length until it finds one with `n` digits.

Here's why I believe the code is correct:

1. The function starts with `k = 1` and increments `k` by 1 in each iteration, ensuring that it checks all possible triangular numbers in ascending order.
2. The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is used to calculate the `k`-th triangular number, which is correct.
3. The `len(str(triangular_number)) == n` condition checks whether the current triangular number has `n` digits, which is the desired property.
4. Once the function finds a triangular number with `n` digits, it returns the corresponding `k` value, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work as expected. The function seems to handle all possible inputs correctly, and the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also pass.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
