Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's a breakdown of why the function works as expected:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts with `idx = 1`, which is the index of the first triangular number (1). This is a correct starting point.

2. **Looping and Calculation**: The function enters a loop where it calculates the `triangular_num` using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. This formula is correct for calculating the `idx`-th triangular number.

3. **Digit Check**: The function checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`. This is the correct condition to check for the number of digits in `triangular_num`.

4. **Return Condition**: Once the function finds a triangular number with `n` or more digits, it returns the current `idx`. This is correct because the function is supposed to return the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

5. **Increment**: If the current triangular number does not have `n` digits, the function increments `idx` by 1 and repeats the loop. This ensures that the function checks every triangular number in ascending order.

Given these points, the function appears to be correct for all positive integer inputs `n`. It correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits by checking each triangular number in sequence.

To verify the correctness, consider the following examples:

- For `n = 1`, the smallest triangular number with 1 digit is 1 (index 1), which the function correctly returns.
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10 (index 4), which the function correctly returns.
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 100 (index 13), which the function correctly returns.

Since the function works as expected for these examples and its logic is sound for all positive integer inputs, it is considered correct.
