Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function works by generating triangular numbers in ascending order and checking the number of digits in each number.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. Initialize `k` to 1, which represents the index of the triangular number.
2. Enter an infinite loop where the function generates the `k`-th triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
3. Check if the number of digits in the generated triangular number is equal to `n` by converting the number to a string and checking its length.
4. If the number of digits matches `n`, return the index `k`.
5. Otherwise, increment `k` by 1 and repeat the loop.

The function is correct because it:

* Generates triangular numbers in ascending order, ensuring that it finds the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
* Correctly checks the number of digits in each triangular number.
* Returns the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function:

* `func_1(2)` returns 4, which corresponds to the triangular number 10 (4th triangular number).
* `func_1(3)` returns 14, which corresponds to the triangular number 105 (14th triangular number).
* `func_1(4)` returns 45, which corresponds to the triangular number 1035 (45th triangular number).

After analyzing the function and the provided unit tests, I couldn't find any potential cases where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
