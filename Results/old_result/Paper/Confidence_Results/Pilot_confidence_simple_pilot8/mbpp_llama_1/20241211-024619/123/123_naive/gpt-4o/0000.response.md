Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts, where the length of the first part is `L`. The function uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this. The expression `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing all elements of `lst` starting from the `L`-th index to the end.

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* When `L` is less than the length of the list
* When `L` is equal to the length of the list
* When `L` is greater than the length of the list (in this case, the first part will be the entire list and the second part will be an empty list)

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)`, the function will return `([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`, which is the expected result.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the function. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
