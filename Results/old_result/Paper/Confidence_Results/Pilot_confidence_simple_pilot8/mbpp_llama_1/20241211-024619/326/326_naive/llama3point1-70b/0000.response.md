Correctness: **False**.

The given Python function `func_1(arr, target)` is supposed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the function takes two parameters: `arr` and `target`. The `target` parameter is not used in the function, which suggests that the function might be incorrectly defined.

Moreover, the function does not handle the case where the input array has less than two elements. In such cases, the function will not return the correct result because it tries to access `arr[i + 1]` in the loop, which will result in an `IndexError` when `i` is the last index in the array.

Another issue is that the function does not handle the case where the input array is empty. In this case, the function will also result in an error because it tries to access `arr[0]` in the line `diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`.

A correct function should handle these edge cases and only take one parameter, which is the input array. 

Here is an example of a correct function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return None  # or any other value to indicate that the array has less than two elements
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the length of the array is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it proceeds with the rest of the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.
