Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2. If so, it returns 0, as there are not enough elements to calculate a difference.

The function then sorts the array in ascending order. It initializes `min_diff` to infinity, which will be used to store the minimum difference found. The function then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. If the calculated difference is less than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff` with the new value.

This approach ensures that the function will find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. The use of sorting allows the function to efficiently compare adjacent elements, which is necessary for finding the minimum difference.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. For example, the test `assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1` checks that the function correctly returns 1, which is the minimum difference between 18 and 19 (or 3 and 4, if the array was not sorted). The test `assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1` checks that the function correctly returns 1, which is the minimum difference between 2 and 3 (or 3 and 4, after sorting).

In general, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs. It handles edge cases, such as when `n` is less than 2, and it correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.
