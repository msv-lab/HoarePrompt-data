Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2. If it is, the function returns 0, which is correct because there are not enough elements to find a difference.

2. The function then sorts the array in ascending order. This is necessary to find the minimum difference between any two elements, because the minimum difference will always be between two adjacent elements in the sorted array.

3. The function initializes `min_diff` to infinity, which ensures that any difference found will be less than `min_diff`.

4. The function then iterates over the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. If the difference is less than `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff`.

5. Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, in the array `(1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25)`, the minimum difference is indeed 1 (between 18 and 19), and the function correctly returns 1.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
