Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The function simply returns the product of the length and width, which is the correct formula for the area of a rectangle.

The program includes three assertions to test the function with different inputs, and all of them pass. Additionally, the function does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results.

In general, the area of a rectangle is calculated as length times width, and the function implements this formula correctly. It handles positive integer inputs as shown in the assertions, and it should also work correctly for positive floating-point numbers and zero.

There are no known cases where the function would not work as expected, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct. 

Note: This function does not include any error checking to handle negative lengths or widths, or non-numeric inputs. Depending on the specific requirements of the problem, such error checking might be necessary. However, based on the provided problem description and assertions, the function appears to be correct.
