Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(num1, num2)` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. Here's why:

- The function uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to compare the two input numbers `num1` and `num2`. The XOR operation returns a binary number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits in `num1` and `num2` are different.

- The `bin()` function is used to convert the result of the XOR operation into a binary string. This binary string is then checked for the number of occurrences of the character '1' using the `count('1')` method.

- If the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the XOR operation will result in a binary number with exactly one '1' bit. Therefore, `bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1')` will return 1, indicating that the numbers differ at one bit position only.

- The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:
  - When `num1` and `num2` are equal, the XOR operation will result in 0, and `bin(0).count('1')` will return 0, correctly indicating that the numbers do not differ at one bit position.
  - When `num1` and `num2` differ at more than one bit position, the XOR operation will result in a binary number with more than one '1' bit, and `bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1')` will return a value greater than 1, correctly indicating that the numbers do not differ at one bit position only.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases and produces the expected output for every possible input, it is considered correct.
