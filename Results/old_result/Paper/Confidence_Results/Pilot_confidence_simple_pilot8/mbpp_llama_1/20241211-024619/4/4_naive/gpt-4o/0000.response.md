Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(a, b)` checks whether two numbers `a` and `b` differ at one bit position only. It uses the XOR operator (`^`) to find the bits that are different between `a` and `b`. The XOR operator returns 1 for each bit position where the bits of `a` and `b` are different.

The function then checks if the result of the XOR operation is not zero (`xor_result!= 0`) and if it is a power of 2 (`xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`). A number is a power of 2 if and only if it has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. Therefore, if the XOR result is a power of 2, it means that `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position.

The function correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- When `a` and `b` are equal, the XOR result is zero, and the function returns `False`.
- When `a` and `b` differ at one bit position, the XOR result is a power of 2, and the function returns `True`.
- When `a` and `b` differ at more than one bit position, the XOR result is not a power of 2, and the function returns `False`.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various inputs. Therefore, the function is correct, and the answer is `True`.
