Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It only removes lowercase characters from the string, but it does not consider substrings. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW", but if the input string is "Hello world", the program will return "Hw", which is not the expected output because it does not remove the entire lowercase substring "world". 

A correct implementation would involve checking for lowercase substrings and removing them entirely, not just individual lowercase characters. 

For instance, the input "aBc" should return "B" because "a" and "c" are lowercase substrings, but the current program will return "B" which is correct but for the wrong reason, it only works for single character substrings, not for longer substrings like "abc" in "aBabc". 

So, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, therefore, it is incorrect.
