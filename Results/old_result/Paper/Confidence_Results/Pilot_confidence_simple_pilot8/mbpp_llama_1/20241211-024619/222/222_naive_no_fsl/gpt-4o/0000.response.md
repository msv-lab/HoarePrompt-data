Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The program simply removes all lowercase characters, not substrings. 

For example, if the input is 'aBc', the program will return 'B', but the correct output should be 'Bc' because 'a' is a lowercase character, not a substring, and 'Bc' is the string with the lowercase substring 'a' removed.

However, the unit tests provided in the problem description do not cover this case. But if we consider the case where the input string is 'abc', the program will return an empty string, but the correct output should be an empty string because there are no uppercase characters or non-lowercase-substrings in the string.

A correct implementation would involve checking for sequences of lowercase characters and removing them. The provided program does not meet this requirement.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: 
If the input string is 'aBCd', the program will return 'BC', but the correct output should be 'BC' because 'a' and 'd' are lowercase characters and are removed. However, if the input string is 'abCd', the program will return 'Cd', but the correct output should be 'Cd' because 'ab' is a lowercase substring and is removed. 

However, the issue arises when the string is something like 'aBCde'. The correct output should be 'BC', but the program will return 'BC' which is correct. But if the string was 'ABCde', the correct output should still be 'ABC', but the program will return 'ABC' which is correct. 

So the program seems to work correctly for the cases 'aBCd', 'abCd', 'aBCde', 'ABCde'. But the issue arises when we consider what a substring is. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The program does not handle this correctly because it removes individual characters, not substrings.

To correctly implement this function, we need to check for sequences of lowercase characters and remove them. Here is an example of how we can do this:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    result = ''
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i].islower():
            while i < len(s) and s[i].islower():
                i += 1
        else:
            result += s[i]
            i += 1
    return result
```

This function correctly removes lowercase substrings from the input string. It does this by iterating over the string and checking if the current character is lowercase. If it is, it skips over the rest of the lowercase substring. If it's not, it adds the character to the result string. 

This corrected function will correctly handle cases like 'aBCd', 'abCd', 'aBCde', 'ABCde', and will return the expected results.
