Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from a given string. It simply iterates over each character in the string and checks if it is uppercase. If it is, the character is added to the result string. However, this approach does not consider the case where a lowercase substring is embedded within a string containing uppercase characters.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW", which is correct. However, if the input string is "Hello world", the program will return "Hw", which is incorrect because it does not remove the lowercase substring "world" completely.

A correct approach would be to identify all lowercase substrings in the string and remove them. The given program does not achieve this. 

A correct implementation would involve checking for sequences of lowercase characters and skipping them when building the result string. The current implementation only checks individual characters, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described. 

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: 

Input: "Hello world"
Expected output: "H"
Actual output: "Hw" 

This example illustrates that the program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the input string.
