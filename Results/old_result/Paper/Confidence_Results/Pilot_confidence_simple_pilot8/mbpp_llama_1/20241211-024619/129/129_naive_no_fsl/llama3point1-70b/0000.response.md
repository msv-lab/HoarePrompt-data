Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the function to find the ASCII value of a given character. The `ord()` function in Python returns the Unicode code point for a one-character string, which is equivalent to the ASCII value for characters in the ASCII range.

The function `func_1` takes a string `char` as input and returns the ASCII value of that character using the `ord()` function. This implementation meets the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly handles any single character input and returns its corresponding ASCII value.

For example, `func_1('A')` would return `65`, which is the ASCII value of the character 'A'. Similarly, `func_1('a')` would return `97`, which is the ASCII value of the character 'a'.

The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle, as it simply returns the ASCII value of any given character. Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
