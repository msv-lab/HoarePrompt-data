Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a given character. The built-in `ord` function in Python returns the Unicode code point for a one-character string, which for ASCII characters corresponds to their ASCII value.

The function takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value. The unit tests provided also validate this functionality, checking that the function correctly returns the ASCII values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to behave incorrectly. It will work correctly for all single-character strings, including both uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

For example, `func_1('a')` would return `97`, `func_1('0')` would return `48`, and `func_1('@')` would return `64`, which are all the correct ASCII values for these characters.

Therefore, the function is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
