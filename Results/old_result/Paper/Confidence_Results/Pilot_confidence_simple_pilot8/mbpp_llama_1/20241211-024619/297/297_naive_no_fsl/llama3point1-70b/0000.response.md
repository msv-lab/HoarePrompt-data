Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the described functionality. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two adjacent elements in the input tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` expression pairs each element in the input tuple with its next adjacent element. This is done by creating an iterator that yields tuples, where the first element of each tuple comes from the original `numbers` tuple, and the second element comes from a slice of `numbers` that starts from the second element (`numbers[1:]`).

2. The `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` expression is a generator that multiplies each pair of adjacent elements together.

3. The `tuple(...)` function converts the generator into a tuple, which is then returned by the function.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Input tuples of any length greater than 1.
- Input tuples containing any type of numbers (integers, floats, etc.).

For example, if you call `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4))`, the function will return `(2, 6, 12)`, which is the expected output according to the problem description.

Without any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to behave incorrectly, the code can be considered correct.
