Correctness: **True**.

The given program is designed to flatten a nested list structure. It uses a recursive approach to achieve this. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.
- It iterates over each element `i` in the input `nested_list`.
- If `i` is a list itself, it calls the function `func_1` recursively on `i` and extends `flat_list` with the returned flattened list.
- If `i` is not a list, it simply appends `i` to `flat_list`.
- Finally, it returns the `flat_list`, which contains all elements from the original nested list, but in a flat structure.

This approach correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and structure. For example, given the input `[[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]], 6]`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the expected flattened list.

The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty list `[]`, which returns an empty list `[]`, and a list containing only non-list elements, such as `[1, 2, 3]`, which returns itself `[1, 2, 3]`.

Since the function works as expected for all potential cases, including nested lists of varying depths and structures, as well as edge cases, it is considered correct.
