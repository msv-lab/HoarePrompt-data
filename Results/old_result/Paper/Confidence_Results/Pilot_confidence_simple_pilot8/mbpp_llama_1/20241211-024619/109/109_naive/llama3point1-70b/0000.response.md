Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(list1, list2)` correctly replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. If `list1` is not empty, it uses Python's list slicing feature to replace the last element (`list1[-1:]`) with `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it simply assigns `list2` to `list1`.

This function handles all potential cases correctly:

- If `list1` is not empty, the last element is replaced with `list2`.
- If `list1` is empty, it is replaced with `list2`.
- If `list2` is empty, the last element of `list1` is replaced with an empty list, effectively removing the last element from `list1`.

There are no edge cases where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct and should return the expected results for all possible inputs.
