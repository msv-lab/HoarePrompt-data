Correctness: **True**

The given Python program checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The provided code correctly implements this logic. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It converts the integer into a string `num_str` to easily calculate the number of digits `num_len`.
3. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits using a generator expression: `sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))`.
4. Finally, it checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number `n` and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the function for different inputs.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly handles numbers of varying lengths and returns the correct result for both Armstrong and non-Armstrong numbers. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
