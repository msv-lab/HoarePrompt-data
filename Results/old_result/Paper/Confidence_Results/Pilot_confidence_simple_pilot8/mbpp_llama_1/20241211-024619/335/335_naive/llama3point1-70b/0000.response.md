Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for every potential case because it only finds the first occurrence of the substring within the string. If the substring appears multiple times in the string, the function will only return the position of the first occurrence. 

For example, if we call `func_1("hellohello", "hello")`, the function will return `('hello', 0, 4)`, but it will not report the second occurrence of "hello" at position 5.

To fix this, the function should be modified to find all occurrences of the substring, not just the first one. 

Here is an example of how the function could be modified to achieve this:

```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    occurrences = []
    start = string.find(substring)
    while start!= -1:
        end = start + len(substring) - 1
        occurrences.append((substring, start, end))
        start = string.find(substring, start + 1)
    if not occurrences:
        return None
    return occurrences
```

This modified function will return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the substring and its start and end positions in the string. If the substring is not found, the function will return `None`.
