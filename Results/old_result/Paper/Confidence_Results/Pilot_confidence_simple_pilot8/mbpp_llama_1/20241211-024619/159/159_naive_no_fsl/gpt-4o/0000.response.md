Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula used in the function, `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, is the standard mathematical formula for calculating the volume of a cone.

The program includes three assertions to test the function with different inputs, and all of these assertions pass with the specified relative tolerance. These tests cover a range of possible inputs and ensure that the function behaves as expected.

Upon reviewing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work correctly. The function correctly handles positive inputs for radius and height, and the use of `math.pi` ensures accurate calculations. The program does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs (such as negative numbers or non-numeric values), but based on the provided problem description, it is assumed that the inputs will be valid.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
