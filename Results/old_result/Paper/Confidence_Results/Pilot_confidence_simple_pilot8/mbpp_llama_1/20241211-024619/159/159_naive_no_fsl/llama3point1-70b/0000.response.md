Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is a function named `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The program correctly implements this formula using the `math.pi` constant for π and the given `radius` and `height` parameters.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including positive values for radius and height, which are the expected inputs for calculating the volume of a cone. It also correctly returns a floating-point number, which is suitable for representing the volume.

Since the program follows the problem description and correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone for all potential cases, it is considered correct. There are no apparent edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to produce incorrect results. 

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, such as negative values or non-numeric inputs. But based on the problem description, which only asks for the correctness of the given program in calculating the volume of a cone, the program meets the requirements. 

Therefore, without any additional requirements or constraints, the program is correct as it stands.
