Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. It correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) by using a list `thirty_days_months` that contains the corresponding month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11). 

The function uses the `in` operator to check if the input `month` is present in the `thirty_days_months` list, which returns `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all possible inputs (month numbers from 1 to 12).

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description, it is considered correct. The code does not contain any missing logic or edge cases that it fails to handle, making it a valid solution to the problem.
