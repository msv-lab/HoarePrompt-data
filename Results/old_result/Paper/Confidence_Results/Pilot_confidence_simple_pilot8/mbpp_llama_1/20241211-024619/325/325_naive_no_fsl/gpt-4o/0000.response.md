Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` to store the month numbers that have 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

The function takes an integer `month` as input and returns `True` if the month is in the `months_with_30_days` set and `False` otherwise.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the months with 30 days and handles all possible inputs from 1 to 12. The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of the function for different inputs.

The function works as expected for all possible inputs:

- For months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), the function returns `True`.
- For months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), the function returns `False`.
- For February (2), the function returns `False`, which is correct because February has 28 or 29 days, not 30.

Since the function handles all possible cases correctly, the program is correct.
