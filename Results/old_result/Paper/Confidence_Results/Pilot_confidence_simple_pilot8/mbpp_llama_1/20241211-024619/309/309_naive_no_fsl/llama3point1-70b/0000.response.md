Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same. It uses the `set(s)` function to create a set of unique characters in the string. If all characters are the same, the set will contain only one character, and `len(set(s))` will return 1. Therefore, the function correctly returns `True` if all characters are the same and `False` otherwise.

This function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty strings: `func_1("")` returns `True` because an empty set has a length of 0, but since there are no characters, it can be considered that all characters (none) are the same. However, it's worth noting that the problem description does not explicitly address the case of an empty string. Depending on the interpretation, one might argue that an empty string should return `True` or `False`. The current implementation returns `False` for an empty string because `len(set(""))` equals 0, not 1.
- Strings with a single character: `func_1("a")` returns `True`.
- Strings with multiple characters: `func_1("aaa")` returns `True`, and `func_1("ab")` returns `False`.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, assuming that an empty string should return `False` because it does not contain any characters that are the same. If the intention is for an empty string to return `True`, the function would need a special case to handle this. However, based on the standard interpretation of the problem and the given code, the function is correct.
