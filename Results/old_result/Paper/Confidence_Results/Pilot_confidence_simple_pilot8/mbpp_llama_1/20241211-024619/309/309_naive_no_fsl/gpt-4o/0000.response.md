Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a given string are the same or not. It correctly handles the edge case where the input string is empty, returning `True` as per the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the function's logic:

1. It first checks if the input string `s` is empty. If it is, the function returns `True`, assuming that an empty string has all characters the same (since there are no characters).
2. It then stores the first character of the string in the variable `first_char`.
3. The function iterates over each character `char` in the string `s`. If it finds a character that is different from `first_char`, it immediately returns `False`.
4. If the function completes the iteration without finding any different characters, it returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including strings with all characters the same (`'aaa'`) and strings with different characters (`'python'` and `'data'`).

After analyzing the function's logic and testing it with the provided unit tests, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
