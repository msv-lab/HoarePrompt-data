Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function works as follows:

1. It converts the integer `n` to a string `str_n`.
2. It then iterates over each character (digit) in the string.
3. For each digit, it counts the number of occurrences of that digit in the string using the `count` method.
4. If the count of any digit is greater than the digit itself (converted back to an integer), it immediately returns `False`.
5. If it checks all digits without returning `False`, it means that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself, so it returns `True`.

This function correctly implements the problem description. It checks every potential case by iterating over each digit in the input integer and comparing its frequency to its value. There are no obvious edge cases that the function does not handle. For example:

- Single-digit numbers: The function works correctly because it simply checks if the digit is less than or equal to itself, which is always true.
- Multi-digit numbers: The function correctly counts the occurrences of each digit and compares them to the digit's value.
- Numbers with repeated digits: The function correctly counts the occurrences of each digit, including repeated ones.
- Zero: The function works correctly with zeros because the count of zeros will always be greater than zero itself, causing it to return `False` as expected according to the problem description.

Given the logic of the function and considering various potential cases, the program seems to correctly implement the problem description. Without being able to find a specific case where the program does not work as expected, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
