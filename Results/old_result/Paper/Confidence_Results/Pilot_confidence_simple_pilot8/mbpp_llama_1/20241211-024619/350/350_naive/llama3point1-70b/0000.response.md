Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates over the array in reverse order and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element it encounters, which is the last position of the target element in the array.

This function works correctly for several reasons:

1. **Sorted Array**: The function assumes the input array is sorted, which means that all occurrences of the target element will be adjacent to each other. By iterating in reverse, it ensures that it finds the last occurrence of the target element.

2. **Reverse Iteration**: The function iterates over the array from the end to the start. This approach guarantees that the first occurrence of the target element it finds will be the last one in the array, given that the array is sorted.

3. **Handling Non-Existent Target**: If the target element does not exist in the array, the function correctly returns -1, indicating that the target element was not found.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as an empty array or an array with a single element correctly. If the target element is present, it returns the correct index; otherwise, it returns -1.

Given the sorted nature of the input array and the reverse iteration approach, the function correctly identifies the last position of the target element. Without any specific counterexamples where this function fails to meet the problem description, it can be concluded that the function is correct.
