Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases because it does not take advantage of the fact that the input array is sorted. This means that the function will still work correctly for unsorted arrays, but it will not be as efficient as it could be for sorted arrays. 

A more efficient solution would use a binary search algorithm, which would allow the function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array in O(log n) time, rather than the O(n) time complexity of the given function.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the target number is `3`, the function will still work correctly, but it will check each element in the array until it finds the target number. A binary search algorithm would be able to find the target number in just a few steps.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work as efficiently as it could: if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and the target number is `10`, the function will check each element in the array until it finds the target number, resulting in 10 comparisons. A binary search algorithm would be able to find the target number in just 4 comparisons. 

However, the main reason the program is incorrect is that it does not handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the target number correctly. The problem description asks for the index of the first occurrence of the target number, but the given function will return the index of the first occurrence it finds, which may not be the first occurrence in the array if the array is not sorted. But since the array is sorted, the function will actually return the index of the first occurrence. 

But there is another case where the program does not work as expected: if the input array is empty, the function will not throw an error or return a special value to indicate that the array is empty. It will simply return -1, which could be a valid index if the target number is not found in a non-empty array. 

So, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
