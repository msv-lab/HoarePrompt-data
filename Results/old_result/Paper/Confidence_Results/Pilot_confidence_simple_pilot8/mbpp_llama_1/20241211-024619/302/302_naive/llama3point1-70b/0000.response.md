Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which returns both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element. As soon as it finds a match (`x == num`), it returns the index `i`. If it iterates through the entire array without finding a match, it returns `-1`.

This function works correctly for several reasons:

1. **Sorted Array Requirement**: Although the function does not explicitly check if the array is sorted, its algorithm does not rely on the array being sorted to find the first occurrence of a number. It simply iterates through the array from start to end, which means it will find the first occurrence of the number regardless of the array's order.

2. **First Occurrence**: The function returns the index as soon as it finds the first match, which meets the requirement of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number.

3. **Handling Non-Existent Numbers**: If the number is not found in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`, indicating that the number does not exist in the array.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as an empty array or an array with a single element correctly. For an empty array, it will return `-1` because it does not find any matches. For an array with a single element, it will return `0` if the element matches the target number and `-1` otherwise.

Therefore, the function works as expected according to the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
