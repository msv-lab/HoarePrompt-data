Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number where each digit is either greater than or less than its adjacent digits, but not equal.

The function works by converting the number to a string and then iterating over each character in the string (except the first and last characters). For each character, it checks if the current digit is either greater than or less than both its adjacent digits. If it finds a digit that does not meet this condition, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. If it iterates over all digits without finding any that do not meet the condition, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating.

The function handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly identifies undulating numbers, such as 121 or 212, and non-undulating numbers, such as 123 or 111. It also handles edge cases, such as single-digit numbers or numbers with only two digits, correctly.

For example, if we call `func_1(121)`, the function will return `True`, because 121 is an undulating number. If we call `func_1(123)`, the function will return `False`, because 123 is not an undulating number.

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
