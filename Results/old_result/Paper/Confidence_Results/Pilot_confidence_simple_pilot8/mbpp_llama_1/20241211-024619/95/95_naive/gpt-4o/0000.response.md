Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in `s`. The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases, including strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', strings with no occurrences of 'std', and an empty string. 

Upon examining the code, it appears that the function correctly handles all potential cases. The `count` method is a standard and reliable way to count the occurrences of a substring in a string, and it does not have any known edge cases that would cause it to fail.

Therefore, based on the provided code and unit tests, it can be concluded that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
