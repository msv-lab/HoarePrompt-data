Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it accurately counts the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. The function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified string. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', strings with a single occurrence, and an empty string. The function handles these cases as expected, returning the correct count of 'std' occurrences.

Since the `count` method is a standard Python function that is well-tested and widely used, it is reasonable to assume that it works correctly for all possible inputs. Therefore, unless there is a bug in the Python interpreter itself, the given program should work correctly for all potential cases. 

No potential case was found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function is simple and directly addresses the problem statement, making it unlikely to have any edge cases that are not handled correctly.
