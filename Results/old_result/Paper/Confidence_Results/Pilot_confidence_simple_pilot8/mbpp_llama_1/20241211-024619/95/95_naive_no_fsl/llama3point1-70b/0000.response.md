Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in `s`. The `count` method of the string class in Python is used to achieve this.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty strings: `func_1("")` returns `0`, which is correct because there are no occurrences of 'std' in an empty string.
- Strings without 'std': `func_1("hello")` returns `0`, which is correct because 'std' does not appear in the string.
- Strings with one occurrence of 'std': `func_1("stdtest")` returns `1`, which is correct.
- Strings with multiple occurrences of 'std': `func_1("stdteststd")` returns `2`, which is correct.
- Strings containing 'std' as a substring of another word: `func_1("stdout")` returns `1`, which is correct because 'std' is counted as a substring.

The function handles all these cases correctly and does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
