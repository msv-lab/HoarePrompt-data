Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` as input, and returns the maximum value in the `n`-th column of the matrix. 

The function uses list comprehension to extract the `n`-th column from the matrix and then applies the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in this column.

This solution correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. It does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it is not handling. The function will work correctly for any valid input, i.e., a non-empty list of lists where each inner list has at least `n+1` elements (since list indices in Python are 0-based).

For example, if the input matrix is `[[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]]` and `n` is `2`, the function will correctly return `19`, which is the maximum value in the 3rd column (at index 2).

The function will also handle cases where the input matrix has different numbers of rows or where the `n`-th column contains duplicate maximum values.

The only potential edge cases that could be considered are:

- An empty input matrix: In this case, the function will raise an exception when trying to access the `n`-th column. However, this is not a valid input according to the problem description, so it is not a correctness issue.
- A matrix with rows of different lengths: If the `n`-th column does not exist in all rows (i.e., some rows have fewer than `n+1` elements), the function will raise an exception when trying to access the `n`-th column. Again, this is not a valid input according to the problem description.
- A non-integer or negative value of `n`: In this case, the function may not behave as expected. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in this case, so it is not a correctness issue.

Overall, the provided program is correct and will work as expected for all valid inputs.
