Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The function uses list comprehension to extract the n'th column from the matrix and then uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in that column.

The function handles the problem description correctly in all potential cases. It does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it is not handling. The function assumes that the input matrix is a list of lists where each inner list has the same length, and that the column index `n` is a valid index for the matrix. If these assumptions are met, the function will work correctly.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and the function passes all of them.

In general, the function is correct because it:

* Correctly extracts the n'th column from the matrix using list comprehension.
* Uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the extracted column.
* Does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it is not handling.

Therefore, the function is correct and will work as expected for all valid inputs.
