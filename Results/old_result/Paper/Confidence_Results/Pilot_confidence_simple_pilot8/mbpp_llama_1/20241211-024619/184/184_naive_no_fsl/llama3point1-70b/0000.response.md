Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. This is achieved using a list comprehension that filters out numbers for which `num % 2 == 0`, i.e., even numbers.

The program correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. It handles:

- Lists containing only odd numbers: It returns the original list.
- Lists containing only even numbers: It returns an empty list.
- Lists containing a mix of odd and even numbers: It returns a list of the odd numbers.
- Empty lists: It returns an empty list.
- Lists with negative numbers: It correctly identifies odd and even negative numbers based on their remainder when divided by 2.
- Lists with zero: It correctly identifies zero as an even number.

Since the program works as expected for all these cases and there are no edge cases that it fails to handle according to the given problem description, it is considered correct.
