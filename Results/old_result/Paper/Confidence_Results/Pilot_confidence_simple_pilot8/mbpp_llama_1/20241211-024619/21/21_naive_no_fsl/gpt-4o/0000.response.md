Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This approach is straightforward and correct for all potential cases.

The `min` function in Python returns the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments. It can handle lists of any size, including empty lists (which would raise a `ValueError`), and lists containing duplicate or negative numbers.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios:

- `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1`: The smallest number in the list is correctly identified as 1.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1`: The smallest number in an already sorted list is correctly identified as 1.
- `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45`: The smallest number in a list where the smallest number is the first element is correctly identified as 45.

To further verify the correctness of `func_1`, consider the following edge cases:

- **Empty list**: `func_1([])` would raise a `ValueError` because the `min` function cannot find the smallest item in an empty sequence. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle empty lists. If the requirement is to handle empty lists, the function could be modified to return a specific value (like `None`) or to raise a custom error with a more informative message.
- **List with duplicate smallest numbers**: `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3]) == 1`: The function correctly returns 1, which is the smallest number in the list, even when it appears more than once.
- **List with negative numbers**: `func_1([-1, 0, 1]) == -1`: The function correctly identifies -1 as the smallest number, demonstrating its ability to handle negative numbers.

Given the provided code and the problem description, the function behaves as expected for all the scenarios and edge cases considered. Therefore, the program is correct based on the information provided.
