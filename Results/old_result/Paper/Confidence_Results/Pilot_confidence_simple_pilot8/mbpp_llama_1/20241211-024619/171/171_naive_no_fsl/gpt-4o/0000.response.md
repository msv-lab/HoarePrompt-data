Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will not be equal to 0, and the function will return `True`. If `n` is even, `n % 2` will be equal to 0, and the function will return `False`.

This function works correctly for all integer inputs, both positive and negative, as well as for zero. The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for a few specific cases.

The key to the function's correctness is the property that `n % 2!= 0` is true if and only if `n` is odd. This property holds for all integers, so the function is correct for all potential inputs.

In particular, the function handles the following edge cases correctly:

- Zero: `func_1(0)` returns `False`, which is correct because 0 is even.
- Negative numbers: `func_1(-3)` returns `True`, which is correct because -3 is odd.
- Positive numbers: `func_1(4)` returns `False`, which is correct because 4 is even.

Since the function works correctly for all potential inputs and edge cases, its correctness is confirmed.
