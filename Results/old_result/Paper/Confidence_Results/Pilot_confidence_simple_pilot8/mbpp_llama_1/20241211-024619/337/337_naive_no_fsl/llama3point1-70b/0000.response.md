Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`. It checks if the count of `i` in `lst` is equal to 1 using the `count` method, and if so, includes it in the sum.

This approach works for all possible cases, including:

- Empty lists: The function will return 0 because there are no elements to sum.
- Lists with all unique elements: The function will return the sum of all elements.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function will only sum the elements that appear once.
- Lists with negative numbers or zero: The function will correctly handle these cases because the `count` method and the `sum` function work with all numeric types.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])`, the function will return `3` because only `3` appears once in the list. If we call `func_1([4, 5, 6])`, the function will return `15` because all elements are unique. If we call `func_1([])`, the function will return `0` because the list is empty.

Overall, the program correctly implements the described functionality and handles all potential cases.
