Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly convert a snake case string to camel case string. The issue is that the program capitalizes the first character of every word, but in camel case, only the first character of each word except the first word should be capitalized. 

For example, if the input is 'hello_world', the program will return 'HelloWorld', but the correct camel case string should be 'helloWorld'. 

To fix this, the program should only capitalize the first character of each word except the first word. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```
