Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly convert a snake case string to camel case. In camel case, the first word is typically in lowercase, while the rest of the words are capitalized. However, the provided function capitalizes all words, including the first one.

For example, if the input is "hello_world", the function will return "HelloWorld", whereas the correct camel case conversion would be "helloWorld". 

To fix this, the function should only capitalize the words after the first one. Here's an example of a corrected function:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
