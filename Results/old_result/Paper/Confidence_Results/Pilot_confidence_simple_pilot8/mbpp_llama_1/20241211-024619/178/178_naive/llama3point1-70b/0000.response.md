Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly implement the problem description. It rounds every number in the given list using a list comprehension, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.

Here's a breakdown of why the code seems correct:

1. **Rounding numbers**: The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` correctly rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer.
2. **Calculating sum**: The `sum(rounded_numbers)` function correctly calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.
3. **Multiplying by length**: The `total_sum * len(numbers)` expression correctly multiplies the sum by the length of the input list.

Since the code handles the rounding, summing, and multiplication correctly, and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail (e.g., handling empty lists, non-numeric inputs, etc.), it seems to be a correct implementation of the problem description.

To further verify, you can test the function with various inputs, such as:

* `func_1([1.2, 2.3, 3.4])`
* `func_1([-1.2, -2.3, -3.4])`
* `func_1([0.5, 1.5, 2.5])`
* `func_1([])`

All of these cases should produce the expected results, confirming that the program is correct.
