Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer using a list comprehension, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns the total sum multiplied by the length of the input list.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Rounding numbers**: The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` correctly rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer.
2. **Calculating sum**: The `sum` function correctly calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.
3. **Multiplying by length**: The program correctly multiplies the total sum by the length of the input list using `len(numbers)`.

The program handles various edge cases, such as:

* Empty list: If the input list is empty, the program will return `0` (since the sum of an empty list is `0` and the length is `0`).
* Single-element list: If the input list contains only one element, the program will correctly round the number, calculate the sum (which is the rounded number itself), and multiply it by the length (`1`).
* List with multiple elements: The program correctly rounds each number, calculates the sum, and multiplies it by the length of the list.

Since the program correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
