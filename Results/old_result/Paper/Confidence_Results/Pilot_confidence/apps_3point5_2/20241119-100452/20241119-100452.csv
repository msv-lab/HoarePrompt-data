For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function `count` calculates the count of valid numbers with at most $k$ different digits, and then the main function `func_1` calculates the difference between the count for $r$ and $l-1$ to get the final sum.

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.
