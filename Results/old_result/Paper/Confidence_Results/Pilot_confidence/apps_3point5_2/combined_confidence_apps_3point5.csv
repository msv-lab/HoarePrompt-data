232,apps,llama3-70b,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,"There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.

Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be ""+""; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be ""-""; otherwise the result will be ""0"".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to find characters that are present in `t`, and finally appends `t` to the end of the constructed string `n`. The logic of the program seems to be correct as it correctly reconstructs the smallest possible integer `n` based on the provided substring `t`. The program handles the case where there may be more than one way to restore the number `n` by constructing the smallest possible integer.

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. It then checks if this minimum sum is greater than the given number n. If it is, it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
3. It then calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It calculates the remainder and distributes it among the sequence to make sure the sum is equal to n.
5. The program then constructs the sequence by multiplying each element by d and adding the remainder appropriately.
6. Finally, it prints the resulting sequence or -1 if no sequence is possible.

31,apps,llama3-70b,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,"ZS the Coder has recently found an interesting concept called the Birthday Paradox. It states that given a random set of 23 people, there is around 50% chance that some two of them share the same birthday. ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.

In Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. 

ZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$. He wants to find the values of A and B (he does not like to deal with floating point numbers). Can you help him?


-----Input-----

The first and only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), meaning that there are 2^{n} days in a year and that ZS the Coder wants to interview exactly k people.


-----Output-----

If the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^{n} days long year equals $\frac{A}{B}$ (A ≥ 0, B ≥ 1, $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) = 1$), print the A and B in a single line.

Since these numbers may be too large, print them modulo 10^6 + 3. Note that A and B must be coprime before their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 are taken.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a given scenario as described in the problem statement. It uses the formula for permutations to calculate the numerator and denominator, then simplifies the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor. Finally, it takes the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 as required. The logic seems sound and the program should work for all possible inputs.",True,,pilot_apps3.json

31,apps,gpt-4o,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,"ZS the Coder has recently found an interesting concept called the Birthday Paradox. It states that given a random set of 23 people, there is around 50% chance that some two of them share the same birthday. ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.

In Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. 

ZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$. He wants to find the values of A and B (he does not like to deal with floating point numbers). Can you help him?


-----Input-----

The first and only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), meaning that there are 2^{n} days in a year and that ZS the Coder wants to interview exactly k people.


-----Output-----

If the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^{n} days long year equals $\frac{A}{B}$ (A ≥ 0, B ≥ 1, $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) = 1$), print the A and B in a single line.

Since these numbers may be too large, print them modulo 10^6 + 3. Note that A and B must be coprime before their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 are taken.

-----Note-----

In the first sample case, there are 2^3 = 8 days in Udayland. The probability that 2 people have the same birthday among 2 people is clearly $\frac{1}{8}$, so A = 1, B = 8.

In the second sample case, there are only 2^1 = 2 days in Udayland, but there are 3 people, so it is guaranteed that two of them have the same birthday. Thus, the probability is 1 and A = B = 1.","import math

Explanation: The program iterates through all numbers starting from 1 and checks if Masha can form that number using the given cubes. It correctly handles the case where Masha can't form a number due to the absence of a specific digit on any cube. The logic of checking if a number can be formed is implemented correctly by iterating through the digits of the number and checking if each digit can be found on any of the cubes. The program terminates when Masha can't form the next number, which is the correct approach to finding the maximum number she can form. The program also considers the constraint that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the balance is 0 correctly. The program checks if the desired balance, $x$, is in the list of prefix balances, but it should be checking if there are any repeated values in the prefix balances list. This is because having repeated values in the prefix balances list means there are infinite prefixes with that balance. 

For example, if $n = 1$, $x = 0$, and $s = 0$, the program would output 0, but the correct output should be -1 since there are infinite prefixes with balance 0.",False,,pilot_apps5.json

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given problem description. It considers the time needed for Edward to exit his apartment, the time needed to walk around the building in both directions, and the time needed to reach Natasha's floor. The logic for calculating these times seems to be correct and follows the rules provided in the problem description. Additionally, the code handles the apartment numbering system accurately.

В первом тестовом примере Эдвард находится в 4 подъезде на 10 этаже, а Наташа находится в 1 подъезде на 2 этаже. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно сначала спуститься на лифте на первый этаж (на это он потратит 19 секунд, из которых 10 — на ожидание и 9 — на поездку на лифте), затем обойти дом против часовой стрелки до подъезда номер 1 (на это он потратит 15 секунд), и наконец подняться по лестнице на этаж номер 2 (на это он потратит 5 секунд). Таким образом, ответ равен 19 + 15 + 5 = 39.

It iterates through each bus route, calculates the time difference between the arrival time of the bus and Serval's arrival time, and selects the bus route with the minimum time difference. This logic ensures that Serval will choose the bus route that aligns with the problem requirements. Additionally, the program accounts for the possibility of multiple buses arriving at the same time and randomly selects one of them. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.",True,,pilot_apps4.json

Unfortunately, he lives far from kindergarten, and his father is too busy to drive him there. The only choice for this poor little boy is to wait for a bus on this rainy day. Under such circumstances, the poor boy will use the first bus he sees no matter where it goes. If several buses come at the same time, he will choose one randomly.

Serval will go to the bus station at time $t$, and there are $n$ bus routes which stop at this station. For the $i$-th bus route, the first bus arrives at time $s_i$ minutes, and each bus of this route comes $d_i$ minutes later than the previous one.

As Serval's best friend, you wonder which bus route will he get on. If several buses arrive at the same time, you can print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $t$ ($1\leq n\leq 100$, $1\leq t\leq 10^5$) — the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. 

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two space-separated integers $s_i$ and $d_i$ ($1\leq s_i,d_i\leq 10^5$) — the time when the first bus of this route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route.


-----Output-----

Print one number — what bus route Serval will use. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.
