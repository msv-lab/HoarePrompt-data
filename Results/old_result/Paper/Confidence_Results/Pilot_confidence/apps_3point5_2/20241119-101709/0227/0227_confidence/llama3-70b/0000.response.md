Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It sorts the input sequence `a`, then iterates through it to check if each element is double the previous element. If not, it increments the variable `m`. Finally, it prints the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations. The program covers all potential cases and works correctly for all given examples. Therefore, I am 100% confident in the correctness of this program.
