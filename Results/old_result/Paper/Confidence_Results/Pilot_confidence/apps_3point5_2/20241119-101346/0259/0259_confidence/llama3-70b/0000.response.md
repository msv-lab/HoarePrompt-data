Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through each bus route, calculates the time difference between the arrival time of the bus and Serval's arrival time, and selects the bus route with the minimum time difference. This logic ensures that Serval will choose the bus route that aligns with the problem requirements. Additionally, the program accounts for the possibility of multiple buses arriving at the same time and randomly selects one of them. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
