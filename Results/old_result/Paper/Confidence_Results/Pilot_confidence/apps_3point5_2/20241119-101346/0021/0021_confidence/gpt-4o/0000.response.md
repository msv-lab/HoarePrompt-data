Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by finding the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array. It then calculates the distance from these elements to the beginning and end of the array and takes the maximum of these distances. This logic covers all possible scenarios and ensures that the maximum distance is achieved by performing exactly one swap.
