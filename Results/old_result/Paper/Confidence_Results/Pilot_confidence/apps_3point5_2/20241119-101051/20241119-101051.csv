The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m, r$ ($1 \leq n \leq 30$, $1 \leq m \leq 30$, $1 \leq r \leq 1000$) — the number of ways to buy the shares on the market, the number of ways to sell the shares on the market, and the number of bourles you hold now.

The next line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \leq s_i \leq 1000$); $s_i$ indicates the opportunity to buy shares at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

The following line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 1000$); $b_i$ indicates the opportunity to sell shares at the price of $b_i$ bourles.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening.

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m, r$ ($1 \leq n \leq 30$, $1 \leq m \leq 30$, $1 \leq r \leq 1000$) — the number of ways to buy the shares on the market, the number of ways to sell the shares on the market, and the number of bourles you hold now.

The next line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \leq s_i \leq 1000$); $s_i$ indicates the opportunity to buy shares at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

The following line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 1000$); $b_i$ indicates the opportunity to sell shares at the price of $b_i$ bourles.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening.

4 2

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first example test, you have $11$ bourles in the morning. It's optimal to buy $5$ shares of a stock at the price of $2$ bourles in the morning, and then to sell all of them at the price of $5$ bourles in the evening. It's easy to verify that you'll have $26$ bourles after the evening.

In the second example test, it's optimal not to take any action.","# Reading input
n, m, r = map(int, input().split())

# Finding the minimum buy price and maximum sell price
min_buy_price = min(s)
max_sell_price = max(b)

# If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, no profit can be made
if max_sell_price <= min_buy_price:
    print(r)
else:
    # Calculate the maximum number of shares that can be bought with current bourles
    max_shares = r // min_buy_price
    # Calculate remaining bourles after buying shares
    remaining_bourles = r % min_buy_price
    # Calculate total bourles after selling all shares at maximum sell price
    total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles
    print(total_bourles)

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening by determining the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. It then calculates the maximum number of shares you can buy and the remaining bourles. Finally, it calculates the total bourles you can have after selling the shares. The logic seems to cover all potential cases and edge cases as per the problem description.",True,,pilot_apps3.json
