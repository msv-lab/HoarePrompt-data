Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **90**

The provided program attempts to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates by using the `abs()` function to get the magnitude and `cmath.phase()` to get the phase angle. However, there is a crucial issue: the program does not import the `cmath` module, which is necessary for the `cmath.phase()` function to work. 

A potential case that demonstrates the program's failure is when the function is called with a complex number, for example, `func_1(1 + 2j)`. Without importing `cmath`, this will raise a `NameError` because `cmath` is not defined.

Thus, the program does not handle the case of missing the necessary import, leading to incorrect behavior.
