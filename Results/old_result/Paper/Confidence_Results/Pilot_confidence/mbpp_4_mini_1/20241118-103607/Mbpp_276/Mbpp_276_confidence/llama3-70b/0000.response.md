Correctness: **False** , Confidence: **90**

The program does not include an import statement for the `math` module, which is necessary to use `math.pi`. Without this import, if the function is called, it will raise a `NameError` because `math` is not defined. 

For example, if you call `func_1(3, 5)`, it will result in an error:

```python
func_1(3, 5)  # This will raise NameError: name 'math' is not defined
```

This indicates that the program does not handle the case where the `math` module is not imported, thus failing to meet the problem description requirements.
