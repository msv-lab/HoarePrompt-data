Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **90**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the last digit of the factorial of a given number. 

For example, consider the input `n = 5`. The factorial of 5 is `5! = 120`, and the last digit is `0`. However, the program will return `0` for any input greater than `4`, which is not accurate for `n = 5`. 

Similarly, for `n = 6`, `7`, and beyond, the factorial will also end with `0`, but the program is hardcoded to return `0` for all `n >= 5` without properly calculating the last digit based on the factorial's actual value.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for several inputs, which confirms that it is incorrect.
