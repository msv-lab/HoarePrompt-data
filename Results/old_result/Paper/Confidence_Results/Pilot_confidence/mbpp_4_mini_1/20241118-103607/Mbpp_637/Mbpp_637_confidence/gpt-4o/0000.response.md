Correctness: **True**  
Confidence: **100**  

The program correctly implements the logic to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by comparing the cost price and selling price. If both are equal, it returns `True`, indicating no profit and no loss; otherwise, it returns `False`. The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Since I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, I am confident in stating that the program is correct.
