Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **95**

The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n`. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2. In these cases, it correctly returns 0, as there are no prime numbers less than 2.
2. It initializes a list `is_prime` of boolean values, where each index represents whether the number at that index is prime. The indices 0 and 1 are set to `False` since 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
3. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers in the list. For each prime number found, it marks all of its multiples (starting from its square) as `False`.
4. Finally, the function returns the sum of the `is_prime` list, which counts the `True` values, representing the prime numbers less than `n`.

I am confident in my assessment because the function has been tested with assertions for common cases (5, 10, 100), and it correctly identifies the number of primes less than those values. Additionally, it handles edge cases like 0, 1, and 2 correctly. 

The only reason I did not give a 100% confidence is the possibility of unexpected edge cases that may not have been explicitly tested, but based on the logic and tested cases, the function appears to be robust.
