Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **90**  

The program incorrectly handles the case when the character `c` appears only once in the string `s`. According to the problem description, the function should remove both the first and last occurrences of the character. If `c` appears only once, the program should return the string without that character. However, the current implementation will return the original string unchanged because it finds the first and last occurrence to be the same and does not remove it.

For example, if we call `func_1("hello", "e")`, the expected output is `"hllo"` (removing the single occurrence of "e"), but the function will return `"hello"` instead.

This indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
