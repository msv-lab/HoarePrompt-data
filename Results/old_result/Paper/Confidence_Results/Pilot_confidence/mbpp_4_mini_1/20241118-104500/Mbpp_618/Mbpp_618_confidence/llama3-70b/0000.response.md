Correctness: **False** , Confidence: **80**

The program does not handle the case where the second list (`list2`) contains a zero. Dividing by zero will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is not addressed in the code. For example, if `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [1, 0, 3]`, the code will attempt to perform the division `2 / 0`, leading to an error.

This shows that there is a potential case where the program does not function as expected, thus making it incorrect.
