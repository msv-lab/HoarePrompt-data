To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1` and see if it correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding XOR and Evenness**:
   - The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or both are odd. 
   - Therefore, we need to count pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function counts the number of even integers (`even_count`) and odd integers (`odd_count`) in the list.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs of even integers using the combination formula `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the number of pairs of odd integers using the same formula.
   - Finally, it returns the sum of these two counts.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The assertions provided in the code test specific cases. We need to validate these cases and consider edge cases as well.

### Edge Cases:
- An empty list `[]` should return `0` since there are no pairs.
- A list with one element `[1]` or `[2]` should also return `0` since there are no pairs.
- A list with all even numbers (e.g., `[2, 4, 6]`) should return the correct count of pairs.
- A list with all odd numbers (e.g., `[1, 3, 5]`) should also return the correct count of pairs.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- For an empty list:
  ```python
  assert func_1([]) == 0  # Should return 0
  ```
- For a single element:
  ```python
  assert func_1([1]) == 0  # Should return 0
  assert func_1([2]) == 0  # Should return 0
  ```
- For all even:
  ```python
  assert func_1([2, 4, 6]) == 3  # (2,4), (2,6), (4,6) => 3 pairs
  ```
- For all odd:
  ```python
  assert func_1([1, 3, 5]) == 3  # (1,3), (1,5), (3,5) => 3 pairs
  ```

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and testing multiple cases, including edge cases, the program works as intended and correctly counts the pairs of integers that XOR to an even number.

Correctness: **True**  
Confidence: **95** 

(Note: The confidence is slightly less than 100 due to the possibility of edge cases that were not explicitly tested in the original assertions, but overall the logic appears sound.)
