Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **90**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element to the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the next, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If it completes the loop without finding any such pair, it returns `True`.

The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the tested cases:
- The first assertion checks a sorted list and returns `True`.
- The second and third assertions check lists that are not sorted and return `False`.

While I am quite confident in the correctness of the program, I assigned a confidence level of 90 instead of 100 because there could be edge cases (like an empty list or a list with a single element) that were not explicitly tested in the assertions. However, according to the logic of the function, both an empty list and a single-element list would return `True`, as they are considered sorted by definition.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for the common cases.
