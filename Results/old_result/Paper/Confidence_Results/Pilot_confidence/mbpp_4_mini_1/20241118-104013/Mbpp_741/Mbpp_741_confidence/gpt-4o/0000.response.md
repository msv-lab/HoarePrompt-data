Correctness: **False** , Confidence: **90**

The program incorrectly asserts that `func_1('python')` returns `False`, which is correct, but it also does not handle the case of an empty string properly. According to the problem description, if the string is empty, it should return `True`, which the function does correctly. However, the given assertions do not cover all potential edge cases, such as strings with mixed characters or special characters.

The primary issue here is that the program does not include assertions for edge cases like a single character string (e.g., `func_1('a')` should return `True`). This oversight indicates that the program may not be thoroughly tested against all possible inputs, leading to potential incorrect outcomes.

Therefore, while the function itself seems to work correctly for the provided cases, the lack of comprehensive testing and the potential for unhandled edge cases leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
