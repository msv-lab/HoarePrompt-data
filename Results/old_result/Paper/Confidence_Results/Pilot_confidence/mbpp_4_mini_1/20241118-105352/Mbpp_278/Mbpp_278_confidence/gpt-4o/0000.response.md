Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **80**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the tuple does not contain any elements before the first tuple element. For example, consider the input `func_1(((4, 6), 10))`. In this case, there are no elements before the tuple `(4, 6)`, but the program will return `0` since it counts the elements before the first tuple, which is correct. However, if we provide an empty tuple `func_1(())`, it will return `0`, which is misleading since there are no elements at all.

Additionally, the program does not consider the case where the first element of the tuple is already a tuple. For instance, `func_1(((4, 6), 10))` should return `0`, but the program would break immediately without counting any elements, which may not be aligned with the expected behavior described.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
