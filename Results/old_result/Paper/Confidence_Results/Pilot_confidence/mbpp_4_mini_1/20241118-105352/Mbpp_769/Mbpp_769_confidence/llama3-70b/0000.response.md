Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **90**

The provided program correctly computes the difference between two lists by using the symmetric difference operation (`^`) on sets created from the input lists. This operation effectively identifies elements that are in either of the two lists but not in both, which aligns with the problem description of getting the difference between two lists. Additionally, the result is sorted before being returned, which is a reasonable output format.

I am confident in this assessment, though I acknowledge that there could be edge cases related to the types of elements in the lists (e.g., if they contain non-hashable types). However, since the problem description does not specify any constraints on the types of elements, I consider the function to be correct for the general case of list inputs.
