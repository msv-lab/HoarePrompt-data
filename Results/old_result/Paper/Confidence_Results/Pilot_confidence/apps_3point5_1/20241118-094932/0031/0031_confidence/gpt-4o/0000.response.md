Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in a group of k people in a year with 2^n days.
2. It handles the case when k > 2^n by printing 1 1, which is the guaranteed probability of two people sharing the same birthday.
3. The program calculates the probability using the given formula and prints the irreducible fraction modulo 10^6 + 3.
4. The program uses the gcd function to find the greatest common divisor of A and B to ensure they are coprime before taking the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3.
5. The program correctly handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the expected output.
