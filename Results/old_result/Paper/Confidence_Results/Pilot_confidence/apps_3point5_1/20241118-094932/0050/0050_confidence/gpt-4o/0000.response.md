Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening by considering the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. It checks if it's profitable to buy and sell shares or not, and then calculates the total bourles accordingly. The logic seems sound and covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. No edge cases or potential cases were identified where the program would fail to provide the correct output.
