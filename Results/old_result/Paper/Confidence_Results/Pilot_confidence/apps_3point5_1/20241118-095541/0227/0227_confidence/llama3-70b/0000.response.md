Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem. It sorts the input sequence and then iterates through it to check if each element is double the previous element. If not, it increments the variable count. The condition `if a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2` ensures that the sequence of operations can be performed with the minimum number of variables. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output as per the problem description.
