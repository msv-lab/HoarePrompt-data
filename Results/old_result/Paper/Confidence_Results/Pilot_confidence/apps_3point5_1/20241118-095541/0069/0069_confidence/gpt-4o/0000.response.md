Correctness: False, Confidence: 100

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$. The program has a logical error in the condition `if x in prefix_balances`, which is checking if the desired balance $x$ is in the list of prefix balances. This condition is incorrect because the prefix balances are not necessarily distinct, and hence checking for equality will not give the correct result.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case of an infinite number of prefixes correctly. It should output -1 if there is an infinite number of prefixes, but the program does not do this.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
