Correctness: **True**, Confidence: **100**

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the input string `s` and the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to check if the characters match. If all characters in the target string are found in the input string in order, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The program follows the problem description accurately and handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the target string. I am confident in my response because the logic of the program aligns with the requirements of the problem description.
