Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through each bus route, calculates the wait time for Serval, and chooses the route with the minimum wait time. The implementation covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including when Serval arrives before the first bus, when the wait time is zero, and when multiple buses arrive at the same time. The program also handles the case where there are multiple possible answers and allows for any of them to be printed. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases, it is correct.
