Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if the input number is already ending with 0, in which case it prints the number as is. If the last digit of the number is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10. The logic covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
