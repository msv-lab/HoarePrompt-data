Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The given Python program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in a list of lists. It iterates through each sublist and compares the length of the sublist with the current maximum length, updating the maximum length if a longer sublist is found. The provided test cases cover different scenarios of varying sublist lengths, and the program produces the expected output for each case. Since the program works as described for all the given test cases, it can be considered correct.
