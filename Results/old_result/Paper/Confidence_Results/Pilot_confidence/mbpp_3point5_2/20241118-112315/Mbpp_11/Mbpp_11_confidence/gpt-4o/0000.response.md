Correctness: False, Confidence: 100

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the character to be removed is at the beginning or end of the string. For example, if we call `func_1('llo', 'l')`, the expected output should be `'lo'`, but the program will return `'o'` because it only removes the first and last occurrence of the character.
