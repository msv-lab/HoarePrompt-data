Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array using `enumerate` to check if the element is present. If found, it returns a tuple with True and the index of the element, otherwise it returns False and -1. The provided test cases all return the expected output, indicating that the function is working correctly for the given problem description. Since all test cases pass and there are no potential cases identified where the program would fail, the correctness is deemed to be True with high confidence.
