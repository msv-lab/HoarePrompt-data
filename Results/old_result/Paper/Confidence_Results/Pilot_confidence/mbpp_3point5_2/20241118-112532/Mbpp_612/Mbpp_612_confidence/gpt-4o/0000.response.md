Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly extracts the first and second elements of each sublist in the input list of lists. The program then returns a list containing two lists, one with all the first elements and the other with all the second elements. The provided test cases cover different types of input lists and the program produces the expected output for all of them. Therefore, I am confident that the program is correct for all potential cases.
