Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **90**

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to maximize the distance between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements after performing exactly one swap. 

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
4
1 3 4 2
```

In this case:
- The minimum element (1) is at index 0.
- The maximum element (4) is at index 2.
- The current distance is `abs(0 - 2) = 2`.

The program calculates the maximum distance as follows:
- It finds the maximum distance using the expression `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, which evaluates to `max(2 - 1, 4 - 2) = max(1, 2) = 2`.
- Then it calculates the minimum distance using `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, which evaluates to `min(2 - 1, 4 - 2) = min(1, 2) = 1`.
- Finally, it prints `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`, which evaluates to `max(2, 4 - 1) = max(2, 3) = 3`.

However, the maximum distance that can be achieved by swapping 1 and 2 is `abs(2 - 1) = 1`. Thus, the program's output of `3` is incorrect for this input. 

This example illustrates that the program does not correctly compute the maximum possible distance after performing exactly one swap, leading to a conclusion that it is indeed incorrect.
