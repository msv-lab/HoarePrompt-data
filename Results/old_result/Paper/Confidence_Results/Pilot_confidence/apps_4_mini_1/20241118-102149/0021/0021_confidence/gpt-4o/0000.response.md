Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **90**

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum distance between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the array after performing one swap. However, it does not correctly handle all potential cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
1 3 2 5 4
```
In this case, the minimum element (1) is at index 0 and the maximum element (5) is at index 3. The program calculates the potential distances to the ends of the array but does not consider the possibility of swapping elements to maximize the distance. The correct maximum distance after a swap could be achieved by swapping 1 with 4, resulting in the array `[4, 3, 2, 5, 1]`, where the distance between 1 and 5 becomes 4 (indices 4 and 3). 

The program only checks distances based on the original positions of the min and max values, which is insufficient to guarantee the maximum possible distance after a swap. 

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements in all cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
