Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **80**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the bourles after trading. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that after buying shares, the program should be able to sell them at the best possible price, and it only sells shares at the first available selling price without considering whether it could have sold them at a higher price later.

For example, consider the following case:

Input:
```
3 3 10
2 3 5
4 5 6
```

- In the morning, you can buy shares at prices 2, 3, and 5 bourles. 
- You have 10 bourles, and the optimal strategy would be to buy 5 shares at 2 bourles each (costing 10 bourles).
- In the evening, you can sell these shares at prices 4, 5, and 6 bourles. 
- The program will sell all shares at the first selling price of 4 bourles, resulting in 5 * 4 = 20 bourles. 
- However, it should ideally sell them at the highest price of 6 bourles, resulting in 5 * 6 = 30 bourles.

Thus, the program fails to maximize the bourles by not considering the best selling price after buying shares, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
