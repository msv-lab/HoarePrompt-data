Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **90**  

The program has a flaw in handling the comparison when both numbers are equal after stripping leading zeros. The logic for determining equality is correct, but the way it handles the case where both `a` and `b` become empty after stripping leading zeros is potentially problematic. For instance, if both inputs are "0000", they will both be stripped to an empty string, and the program will set them to '0'. However, if the inputs were "0000" and "0000", it would print '=', which is correct. 

The main issue arises with the comparison logic after stripping zeros. The program correctly handles the length comparison and then compares the stripped strings. However, if the inputs are such that they are equal before stripping (like "000123" and "000123"), the program will work correctly. The issue might arise with inputs that are equal but have different leading zeros, such as "000123" and "000123". 

However, after thorough consideration, I believe the program handles all edge cases correctly, including leading zeros and equality checks. Therefore, I am confident that the program is correct for all described scenarios, even though the logic could be simplified.

Thus, I will revise my confidence down to 90, as I see no clear failure case but acknowledge the complexity in reasoning about the leading zeros. 

In conclusion, since I cannot find a case where the program fails, I will adjust my answer:

Correctness: **True**  
Confidence: **90**  

The program correctly handles inputs with leading zeros, compares the lengths of the stripped strings, and then compares the values accurately. The output is generated as specified in the problem description.
