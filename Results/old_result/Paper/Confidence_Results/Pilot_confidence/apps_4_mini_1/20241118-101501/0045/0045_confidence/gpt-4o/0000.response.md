To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description and potential edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input Requirements**: The program accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where both are positive integers.
2. **Output Requirements**: The program must either return a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and have the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD), or return `-1` if no such sequence exists.
3. **Strictly Increasing Sequence**: The sequence must be strictly increasing, meaning each element must be greater than the previous one.

### Code Analysis
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The program calculates `min_sum` as the sum of the first `k` positive integers: `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is correct since the smallest strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers is `1, 2, ..., k`.
2. **Feasibility Check**: If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program correctly returns `-1`, as it's impossible to create a valid sequence.
3. **GCD Calculation**: The program calculates `d`, which is the maximum GCD that can be applied to each element of the sequence.
4. **Sequence Generation**: The program generates the sequence by multiplying each integer from `1` to `k` by `d`, resulting in `[d, 2d, ..., kd]`. 
5. **Remainder Handling**: It attempts to distribute any remaining sum (from `n - d * min_sum`) across the sequence while ensuring it remains strictly increasing.

### Edge Cases
- **Case with `n < min_sum`**: This is correctly handled by returning `-1`.
- **Case with `k = 1`**: If `k` is `1`, the output should simply be `n` if `n` is positive. The code handles this correctly since `min_sum` will equal `n` if `n` is `1`.
- **Case with large `n` and small `k`**: For example, `n = 100` and `k = 2`. The sequence `[1, 99]` or `[2, 98]` should work. The program should handle this correctly by calculating appropriate values of `d` and distributing the remainder.
- **Case with `k` being very large**: If `n` is small compared to `k`, such as `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the program will return `-1` correctly.

### Potential Issue
One potential issue arises in the sequence generation and remainder distribution:
- The program does not ensure that after adding to the elements of the sequence, they remain strictly increasing. For instance, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the generated sequence could be `[3, 4, 5]` with `d = 1` and `remainder = 2`. If the code incorrectly distributes the remainder, it could produce a sequence like `[3, 5, 5]`, which is not strictly increasing.

### Conclusion
The program logic is mostly correct, but it does not guarantee that the final sequence remains strictly increasing after handling the remainder. Thus, it can fail to meet the problem's requirements in certain edge cases.
