Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **90**  

The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the situation where the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal, and the unknown votes could tip the result either way.

For example, consider the input `0 0 1`. According to the problem description, this should output `?` because with one unknown vote, the result could either be `+` (if the unknown vote is an upvote) or `-` (if the unknown vote is a downvote). 

However, the program would incorrectly classify this as uncertain due to the conditionals:

1. `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` is false (0 < 0 is false).
2. `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` is false (0 < 0 is false).
3. It defaults to printing `?`, which is correct in this case.

But let's consider another case, `1 1 1`. The possible outcomes are:
- If the unknown votes upvote, the result is `+`.
- If the unknown votes downvote, the result is `-`.
- If the unknown votes split evenly, the result is `0`.

In this case, the output should also be `?` since there are multiple possible results. The program's logic does not explicitly handle the case when upvotes and downvotes are equal but have unknown votes that can shift the result.

In summary, the program does not correctly identify all scenarios where the result is uncertain when there are equal upvotes and downvotes with unknown votes. Thus, it is deemed incorrect.
