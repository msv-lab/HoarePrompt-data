Correctness: **True**  
Confidence: **95**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the difference `c`. 

Here's the reasoning for each case:

1. **When `b` equals `a`**: The program checks if `b == a` and prints "YES". This is correct since `b` is the first element of the sequence.

2. **When `c` equals `0`**: The program checks if `c == 0` and prints "NO". This is also correct because if `c` is `0`, the sequence is constant (all elements equal `a`), and `b` can only be equal to `a` to return "YES".

3. **When `c` is not `0`**: The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`. 
   - The first condition checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by taking steps of size `c`, which is correct.
   - The second condition ensures that the number of steps taken from `a` to reach `b` is non-negative, which means `b` must be greater than or equal to `a` when `c` is positive, or less than or equal to `a` when `c` is negative.

Given these checks, the program accurately covers all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, I am confident in my assessment that the program is correct.
