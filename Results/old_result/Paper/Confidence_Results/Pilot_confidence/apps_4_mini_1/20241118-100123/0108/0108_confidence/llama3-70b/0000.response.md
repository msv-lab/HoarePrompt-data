Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **90**

The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where it is impossible to form the subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" from the input string. 

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input string `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy"`. 
- The expected output should be `-1` because there is no `z` in the string, which is necessary to complete the alphabet sequence.
- However, the program would incorrectly output `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` because it processes each character in the `alphabet` string and replaces them, failing to check if the full sequence can be formed.

This shows that the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, as it does not account for the need to have all letters from `a` to `z` present in the string. 

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case, leading to the conclusion that it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
