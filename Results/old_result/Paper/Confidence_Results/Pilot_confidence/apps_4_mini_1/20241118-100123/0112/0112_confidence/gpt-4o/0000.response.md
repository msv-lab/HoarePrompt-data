Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **90**

The program does not correctly handle the case when a digit can be formed using multiple cubes. Specifically, it does not allow for the reuse of cubes for different digits in the same number. For example, if Masha needs to form the number 12, and she has two cubes with the digits 1 and 2, the program might incorrectly assume that she can only use one cube for each digit due to the way it tracks used cubes. 

Hereâ€™s a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

Input:
```
2
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 0 1 2
```

In this case, Masha can form the numbers 1 through 12, but if she attempts to form 11, the program will incorrectly conclude that it cannot be formed because it would need to use the same cube for both digits '1', which is not allowed according to the logic in the code. The program only allows one cube to be used for each digit, which is a flaw in its logic.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
