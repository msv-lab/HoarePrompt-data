To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func_1` function and check if it adheres to the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Location Calculation**:
   - The function `get_location` calculates the block (entrance) and the floor for a given apartment number. This seems to be correctly implemented based on the apartment numbering scheme described.

2. **Time to Exit**:
   - The time to exit is calculated based on whether Edward is already on the first floor or needs to take the elevator down. The elevator time includes a 10-second wait plus the time taken to descend, which is correctly accounted for.

3. **Walking Time**:
   - The program calculates both direct and reverse walking times between blocks using the formula `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15` and `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. This appears to correctly handle the circular nature of the building.

4. **Time to Target Floor**:
   - The time taken to reach the target floor is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, which correctly accounts for the time taken to walk up or down floors.

5. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - The total time is the sum of the time to exit, the minimum walking time, and the time to reach the target floor, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Potential Edge Cases:

Despite the logic appearing correct, we need to consider edge cases:

1. **Same Entrance**: If Edward and Natasha live in the same entrance but on different floors, the walking time should be zero, and only the elevator time and time to reach the target floor should be counted. This scenario seems to be handled correctly.

2. **First Floor Scenario**: If Edward is on the first floor (e.g., apartment 1) and Natasha is on the second floor of the same entrance, the time to exit should be zero, and the only time counted should be the time to walk to Natashaâ€™s apartment, which is also handled correctly.

3. **Maximum Values**: We should consider the maximum constraints (n, m, k = 1000). The calculations involve simple arithmetic operations and should not cause any overflow or performance issues given Python's handling of integers.

4. **Edge Cases with Apartments**: If Edward lives in the last apartment (e.g., apartment `n * m * k`) and Natasha lives in the first apartment (1), the calculations should still yield the correct minimal time, which the code appears to handle.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and considering potential edge cases, I find that the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Since I cannot identify any specific cases where the program fails to meet the requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**, Confidence: **95**

I am confident but note that without exhaustive testing, I cannot guarantee absolute correctness. The logic appears sound based on the provided problem description and example cases.
