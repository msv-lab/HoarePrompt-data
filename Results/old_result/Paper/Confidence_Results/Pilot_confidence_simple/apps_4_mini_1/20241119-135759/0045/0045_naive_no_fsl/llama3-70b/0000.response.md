To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we will analyze the logic implemented in the code.

1. **Understanding the requirements**:
   - We need to find a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers such that:
     - The sum of the sequence equals `n`.
     - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized.
   - If no such sequence exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The program starts by checking if `n < k`. If this is true, it outputs `-1` because it is impossible to have `k` positive integers that sum to `n` if `n` is smaller than `k`.
   - The program then attempts to create a sequence of integers from `1` to `k`. This is done in a loop where it appends numbers to `seq` as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the current number `i` (ranging from `1` to `k`).
   - It then checks if the length of `seq` is equal to `k`. If not, it prints `-1`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing `-1`.
   - However, it only constructs the sequence `1, 2, ..., k`. This does not guarantee that the GCD of the sequence is maximized.
   - For example, consider `n = 10` and `k = 3`. The program constructs the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`, which sums to `6`, and outputs `-1` correctly.
   - However, it does not check for alternative sequences that might maximize the GCD, such as `[2, 3, 5]`, which is a valid sequence summing to `10` with a GCD of `1`, or `[2, 4, 4]` (which is not strictly increasing), or `[2, 3, 5]` (valid).
   - The GCD maximization is not addressed in the construction of the sequence, leading to the potential failure in cases where a valid sequence exists, but is not represented by the simple incrementing integers.

4. **Example Cases**:
   - For `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program may output `-1`, while it could have generated a valid output like `[1, 2, 7]` or `[2, 3, 5]` that sums to `10` or simply multiples of any number ensuring the GCD is maximized.

Given these considerations, the program does not correctly fulfill the problem requirements for all input cases.

**Correctness: False**
