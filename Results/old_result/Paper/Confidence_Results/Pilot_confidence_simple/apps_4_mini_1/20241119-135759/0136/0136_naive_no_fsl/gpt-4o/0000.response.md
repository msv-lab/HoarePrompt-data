To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze how the program works and whether it meets all the requirements.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.read` to read the entire input at once, which is acceptable for handling large inputs. It then splits the input into two strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Leading Zeroes Removal**:
   - It strips leading zeroes from both `a` and `b` using `lstrip('0')`. If the strings become empty after stripping, it assigns them the value '0'. This is correct, as it handles cases where the input might be just zeroes.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The program first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. This is a valid approach because:
     - A longer string representing a number will always be greater than a shorter string (if both are valid non-negative integers).
   - If the lengths are equal, it then compares the strings lexicographically.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparisons.

### Potential Edge Cases

- The program seems to handle edge cases correctly, including:
  - Both numbers being zero: `0` and `0` will output `=`.
  - One number having leading zeroes, e.g., `0001` compared to `1`, will output `=`.
  - A larger number with leading zeroes, e.g., `000123` compared to `123`, will output `=`.
  - Cases where one number is significantly larger than another.

### Conclusion

After careful consideration, it appears that the program handles the requirements of the problem description correctly for all tested cases. 

### Final Verdict

Correctness: **True**

The logic for handling leading zeroes, comparing lengths, and performing lexicographic comparison is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. No counterexamples can be identified that would cause the program to fail under the described constraints.
