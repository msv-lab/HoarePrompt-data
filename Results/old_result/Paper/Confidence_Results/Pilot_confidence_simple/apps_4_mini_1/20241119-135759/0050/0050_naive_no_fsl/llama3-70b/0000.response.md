Correctness: **False**

The program has a flaw in the selling logic. The second loop iterates through the selling prices, but it incorrectly resets `shares` to `0` after the first sale. This means that if there are multiple selling opportunities, the program only utilizes the first one and ignores any subsequent selling opportunities, which could maximize the final amount of bourles.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3 10
2 5 3
4 6 5
```

In this case:

1. In the morning, the program can buy shares at prices 2, 3, or 5 bourles.
2. The best option is to buy 5 shares at 2 bourles each (using 10 bourles), resulting in 0 bourles left and 5 shares owned.
3. In the evening, when trying to sell, the program will sell all 5 shares at 4 bourles each (the highest price).
4. The program will incorrectly reset `shares` to `0` after this sale, meaning it won't consider selling at the next prices (6 and 5).

Thus the final output will be 20 bourles instead of the correct result, which is 30 (if the program correctly sold 5 shares at 6 bourles each first).

Due to this incorrect handling of multiple selling opportunities, the program does not satisfy the problem description completely and therefore is deemed incorrect.
