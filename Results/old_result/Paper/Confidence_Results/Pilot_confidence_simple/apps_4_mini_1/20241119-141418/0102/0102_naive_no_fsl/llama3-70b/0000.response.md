Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately converts an integer score between 0 and 99 into its corresponding English word representation, following the problem description. 

Here's the breakdown of how the program handles various cases:

1. **For numbers 0-9**: The program correctly maps single digits to their corresponding words using the `ones` list.
   - Example: Input `6` outputs `six`, which is correct.

2. **For numbers 10-19**: It correctly maps these numbers using the `teens` list.
   - Example: Input `13` outputs `thirteen`, which is correct.

3. **For multiples of ten from 20 to 90**: The program uses the `tens` list to handle these cases correctly.
   - Example: Input `20` outputs `twenty`, and input `40` outputs `forty`, both of which are correct.

4. **For numbers from 21 to 99 that are not multiples of ten**: The program constructs the output by combining the appropriate entries from the `tens` and `ones` lists, separated by a hyphen when needed.
   - Example: Input `25` outputs `twenty-five`, which is correct.

The program correctly covers all edge cases, including the boundaries of the input range (0 and 99).

Since there are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the problem requirements, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
