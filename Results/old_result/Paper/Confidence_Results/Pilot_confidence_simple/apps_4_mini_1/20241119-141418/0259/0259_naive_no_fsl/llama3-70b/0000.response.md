To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic in relation to the problem description.

The program is supposed to find out which bus Serval will take based on the time he arrives at the bus station and the schedules of the buses. 

### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads `n` (the number of bus routes) and `t` (the time Serval arrives at the station). It then collects the bus schedules (first arrival time `s_i` and interval `d_i`) into a list called `buses`.

2. **Finding the Next Bus Time**:
    - The line `time = (t - s) % d` is meant to calculate the time Serval would have to wait for the bus for each route.
    - This calculation, however, is not correct for determining whether a bus is available when he arrives. 
    - If `t < s`, the bus hasn't arrived yet, and Serval will wait for the first bus at time `s`.
    - If `t >= s`, we need to check if he can catch a bus that arrives at or after his arrival time. The correct calculation should be checking the next bus time after or exactly at `t`.

### Identifying a Failing Case:

Let's consider a case where `t` is less than the first bus arrival time:

- **Example Input**:
    ```
    1 2
    5 3
    ```
    Here, Serval arrives at `2`, the first bus arrives at `5`, and the interval is `3`. According to the logic in the program, it would calculate `time = (2 - 5) % 3`, which results in `1`, but it should recognize that the bus hasn't arrived yet and should return `1` (the only bus route), as there are no other buses available before `5`.

In this specific case, the program would incorrectly provide the result as `-1`, whereas it should determine that the first bus route (1) is the only one Serval can wait for.

### Conclusion:

Since the program fails for the above case where `t < s`, it does not handle all potential cases correctly as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is not upheld across all conditions.

Correctness: **False**
