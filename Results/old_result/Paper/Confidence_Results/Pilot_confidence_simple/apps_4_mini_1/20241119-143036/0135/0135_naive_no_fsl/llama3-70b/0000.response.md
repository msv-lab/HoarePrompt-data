Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. 

For example, consider the case where \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 10 \). The program will calculate the remainders as follows:

- \( 10 \mod 1 = 0 \)
- \( 10 \mod 2 = 0 \)
- \( 10 \mod 3 = 1 \)
- \( 10 \mod 4 = 2 \)
- \( 10 \mod 5 = 0 \)
- \( 10 \mod 6 = 4 \)
- \( 10 \mod 7 = 3 \)
- \( 10 \mod 8 = 2 \)
- \( 10 \mod 9 = 1 \)
- \( 10 \mod 10 = 0 \)

As we can see, in this case, the remainders \( 0 \), \( 1 \), and \( 2 \) repeat for different values of \( i \). Specifically, \( 10 \mod 1 \), \( 10 \mod 2 \), and \( 10 \mod 5 \) all yield the same result \( 0 \).

Therefore, the program will output "No" for this case, which is correct, but it fails to check an edge case where both \( n \) and \( k \) are equal and large. Moreover, when \( k \) is greater than \( n \), the modulo operation behavior must be carefully analyzed.

Thus, there are potential inputs where the program does not meet the requirements. Hence, the program is incorrect.
