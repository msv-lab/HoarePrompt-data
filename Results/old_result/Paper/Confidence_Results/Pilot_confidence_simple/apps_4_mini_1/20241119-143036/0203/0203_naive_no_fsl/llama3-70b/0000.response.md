Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It simply counts the number of employees from each faction (depublicans and remocrats) and determines the winner based on which faction has more members. 

However, the problem description specifies that the voting process is dynamic: employees can deny other employees the right to vote, and this can change the outcome based on the sequence of actions taken by the employees. The program fails to account for this dynamic nature. For example, in a situation where there is a strategic denial of votes, the faction with fewer members could still win if they deny enough members from the opposing faction.

Consider the input:
```
5
DDRRR
```
In this case, the depublicans could deny the remocrats strategically, leading to the victory of the depublicans despite there being three remocrats.

The program does not simulate the voting and denying process, which is essential to correctly predict the outcome of the vote according to the provided problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.
