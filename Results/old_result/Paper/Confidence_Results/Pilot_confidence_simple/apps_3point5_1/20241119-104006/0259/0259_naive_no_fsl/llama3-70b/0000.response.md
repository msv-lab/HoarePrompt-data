Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station.
2. It then reads the input values for the arrival time of the first bus and the interval between two buses for each bus route.
3. It calculates the time difference between Serval's arrival time and the arrival time of the first bus for each route, taking into account the interval between buses.
4. It keeps track of the minimum time difference and the corresponding bus route number.
5. Finally, it prints the bus route that Serval will use, which is the one with the minimum time difference.

The program follows the problem description for every potential case and works correctly for all the provided examples.
