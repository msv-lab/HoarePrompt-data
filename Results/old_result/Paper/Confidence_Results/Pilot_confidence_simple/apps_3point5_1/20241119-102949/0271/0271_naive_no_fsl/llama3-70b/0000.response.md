Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly rounds the given number to the nearest integer that ends with zero. It handles all cases as described in the problem statement by checking the remainder of n divided by 10. If the remainder is 0, it means n is already rounded, so it prints n. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from n. Otherwise, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to n. This logic covers all possible scenarios and produces the correct output for each case.
