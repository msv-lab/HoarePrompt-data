Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly defines a function `func_1` that checks if the number `n` has at most `k` different digits by converting it to a string, converting the string to a set to get unique digits, and then checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to `k`.
2. The program correctly defines a function `func_2` that iterates through the range from `l` to `r`, checks if each number in the range satisfies the condition of having at most `k` different digits using `func_1`, and then calculates the total sum modulo `998244353`.
3. The program correctly reads the input values for `l`, `r`, and `k`, calls `func_2` with these values, and prints the result.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and logic provided, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
