Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by first sorting the buy and sell prices, then iterating through the buy prices to buy as many shares as possible, and finally iterating through the sell prices to sell all bought shares. The logic of buying and selling shares based on the prices and the available funds is correctly implemented. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all inputs.
