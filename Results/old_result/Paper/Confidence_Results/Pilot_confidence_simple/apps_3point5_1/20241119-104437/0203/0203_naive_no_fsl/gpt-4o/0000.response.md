Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly simulates the voting process according to the problem description. It maintains two queues, one for depublicans and one for remocrats, and then iterates through the queues based on the order of employees. The program correctly handles the case where an employee is denied the right to vote and skips their turn. The outcome of the vote is determined based on which queue still has members left at the end. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
