Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if the given number `n` ends with 0, if yes then it is already rounded. If not, it determines the nearest multiple of 10 by either subtracting the remainder when divided by 10 or adding the complement to the nearest multiple of 10. The program covers all possible cases where rounding needs to be done and provides the correct output. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
