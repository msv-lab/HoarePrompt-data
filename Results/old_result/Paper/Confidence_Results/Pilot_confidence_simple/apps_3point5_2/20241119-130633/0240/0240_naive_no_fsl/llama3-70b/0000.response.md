Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to extract the characters that are present in `t`. Finally, it concatenates `t` to the end of the extracted characters to form the smallest integer `n` and returns it.

The program correctly handles the problem description as it extracts the characters that are present in the substring `t` from the string `s`, ensuring that `n` contains all the required digits. The logic of the program is sound and the output for the given examples align with the problem requirements.
