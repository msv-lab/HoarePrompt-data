Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of cubes and the faces of each cube.
2. The function `can_form_number()` correctly checks if a number can be formed using the given cubes by iterating through the digits of the number and checking if there is a cube with the required digit.
3. The main function `func_1()` iteratively finds the maximum number x that can be formed using the given cubes by calling `can_form_number()` for each number and incrementing x until the condition is not met.
4. The program uses a brute-force approach to find the maximum number x that can be formed using the cubes, which is a valid approach for this problem.
5. The program handles all possible cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement.
6. The program logic matches the problem description, and it provides the correct output for the given examples provided in the problem description.
