Correctness: True

Explanation: The code provided correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function `func_1` implements the logic to count such numbers efficiently using dynamic programming. The input is parsed correctly, the function is called with the input values, and the result is printed modulo $998244353$. The code follows the problem description and works as expected for all possible cases.
