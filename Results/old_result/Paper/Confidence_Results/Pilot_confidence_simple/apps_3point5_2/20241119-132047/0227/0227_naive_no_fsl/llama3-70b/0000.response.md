Correctness: True

I have carefully reviewed the code and the problem description, and I believe the code is correct for all potential cases. The code calculates the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations correctly. The logic of sorting the input list and checking if each element is equal to the previous element times 2 is valid and ensures that the operations can be performed as described in the problem. The code also handles the case where the number of variables exceeds 23 by returning -1. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.
