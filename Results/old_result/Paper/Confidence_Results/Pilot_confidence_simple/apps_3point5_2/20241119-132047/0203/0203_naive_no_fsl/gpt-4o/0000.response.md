Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the described voting procedure where employees take turns making statements and denying others the right to vote until only one employee is left. The program keeps track of the indices of employees belonging to depublicans and remocrats in separate queues and simulates the voting process. It handles the scenario where an employee denies another employee the right to vote and ensures that the process continues until only one faction remains. The program outputs the correct faction based on the remaining queue at the end of the process. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and produces the expected outcome for all potential cases.
