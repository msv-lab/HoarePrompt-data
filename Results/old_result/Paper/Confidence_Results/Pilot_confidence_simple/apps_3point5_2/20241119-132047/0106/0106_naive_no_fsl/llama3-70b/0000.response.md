Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code correctly calculates the floor and block numbers for both Edward's and Natasha's apartments.
2. It correctly calculates the minimum time to move between blocks and between floors within a block.
3. The final output is the sum of the minimum block time and the minimum floor time, which is the correct approach to find the minimal time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
4. The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, including moving between blocks, moving between floors, and considering the circular nature of the building.
