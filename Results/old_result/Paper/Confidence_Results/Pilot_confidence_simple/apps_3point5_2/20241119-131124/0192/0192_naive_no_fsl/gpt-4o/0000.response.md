Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program takes the input of two integers x and y, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the triangle of side length x and prints the result. The logic used in the program correctly follows the problem description by calculating the difference between x and y divided by 2, and adding the modulo 2 of the difference. This correctly determines the minimum number of seconds required. The program handles all potential cases and edge cases as specified in the problem description, making it correct.
