Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads two non-negative integers as input, removes any leading zeroes, and then compares the two numbers. It correctly prints "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b. The program handles the cases where a and b have leading zeroes and where a and b are equal. It also considers the case when a < b and when a > b. The logic in the program aligns with the problem description for all possible cases.
