Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

The program correctly follows the problem description by first taking the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the initial number of bourles. It then calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. 

The program then checks if the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price. If it is, it prints the initial number of bourles as there is no profit to be made. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial bourles, the remaining bourles after buying the maximum number of shares, and then calculates the total bourles after selling all the shares at the maximum sell price.

This logic covers all potential cases and ensures that the maximum profit is calculated correctly. The program is correct for all possible inputs and scenarios.
