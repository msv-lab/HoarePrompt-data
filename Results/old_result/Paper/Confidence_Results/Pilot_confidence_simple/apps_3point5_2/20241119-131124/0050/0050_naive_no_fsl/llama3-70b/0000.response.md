Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by first sorting the buy and sell prices, then iterating through the buy prices to buy as many shares as possible, and finally iterating through the sell prices to sell all the bought shares. The program ensures that the number of shares bought does not exceed the available money and that the number of shares sold does not exceed the number of shares bought. Overall, the logic of the program is sound and it covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
