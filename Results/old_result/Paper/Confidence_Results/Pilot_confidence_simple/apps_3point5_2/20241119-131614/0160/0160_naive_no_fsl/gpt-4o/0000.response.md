Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program takes the input values correctly.
2. It calculates the sum of all elements in the array A.
3. The program defines two functions, func_1 which calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of numbers, and func_2 which finds all the divisors of a given number.
4. The program then calculates the gcd of the array A and finds all the divisors of the sum of the array elements.
5. It iterates through the divisors and checks if the divisor can divide every element of A after performing the operations described in the problem.
6. If a divisor is found that satisfies the condition, it prints the divisor and breaks out of the loop.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly identifies the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
