Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the size of the permutation and the elements in the array.
2. It correctly identifies the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array.
3. It calculates the distances between the minimum and maximum elements at the ends of the array as described in the problem.
4. It then calculates the maximum possible distance by considering all possible swaps and outputs the correct result.
