Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the details of each bus route.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the input time value 't' and the intervals between buses.
3. The function then determines the bus route with the minimum wait time and returns the chosen route number.
4. The program prints the chosen bus route number as the output.

Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for the given inputs.
