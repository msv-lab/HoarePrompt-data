To determine if the given Python program is correct based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and see if it aligns with the requirement of counting the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Understanding the Requirement:
1. **XOR Characteristics**:
   - The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or both are odd.
   - Therefore, we need to count pairs of integers that are both even or both odd.

### Analyzing the Given Code:
1. The function `func_1` counts the number of even and odd integers in the list:
   - `even_count` counts how many numbers are even in the list.
   - `odd_count` is derived from the total length of the list minus `even_count`.

2. It calculates the number of pairs of even integers:
   - `even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`, which counts the number of ways to choose 2 from `even_count`.

3. Similarly, it calculates the number of pairs of odd integers:
   - `odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`, which counts the number of ways to choose 2 from `odd_count`.

4. Finally, it returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`.

### Checking the Provided Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: `func_1([5, 4, 7, 2, 1])`
   - Even numbers: 4, 2 → Pairs: (4,2) → 1 pair
   - Odd numbers: 5, 7, 1 → Pairs: (5,7), (5,1), (7,1) → 3 pairs
   - Total pairs: 1 + 3 = 4 (matches expected).

2. **Test Case 2**: `func_1([7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11])`
   - Even numbers: 2, 8, 0 → Pairs: (2,8), (2,0), (8,0) → 3 pairs
   - Odd numbers: 7, 1, 5, 11 → Pairs: (7,1), (7,5), (7,11), (1,5), (1,11), (5,11) → 6 pairs
   - Total pairs: 3 + 6 = 9 (matches expected).

3. **Test Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3])`
   - Even numbers: 2 → 0 pairs
   - Odd numbers: 1, 3 → Pairs: (1,3) → 1 pair
   - Total pairs: 0 + 1 = 1 (matches expected).

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List**: `func_1([])` should return `0`, as there are no pairs.
- **Single Element List**: `func_1([1])` or `func_1([2])` should return `0`, as there are no pairs.
- **All Even Numbers**: `func_1([2, 4, 6, 8])` should return `6` (3 pairs).
- **All Odd Numbers**: `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7])` should return `6` (3 pairs).

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the function with various test cases and edge cases, it correctly counts the number of pairs that XOR to an even number. Since I could not find any failing cases based on the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
