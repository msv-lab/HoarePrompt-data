Correctness: **False**

The program claims to check whether all characters in a string are the same. However, the assertions provided include a mistake. The first assertion `assert func_1('python') == False` is incorrect because the expected result should be `False`, which is correct in terms of functionality, but the program logic returns `True` for an empty string, which can be argued to be a potential case that is not clearly defined in the problem statement.

Moreover, if we consider the input of an empty string `''`, the program returns `True`, implying that all characters (none in this case) are the same, which is debatable. While the function works correctly for non-empty strings where not all characters are the same and for strings with the same character, the handling of the empty string scenario introduces ambiguity, which can be seen as a flaw.

Thus, because the program does not account for or clarify the case of an empty string appropriately as per the problem description, the correctness is deemed **False**.
