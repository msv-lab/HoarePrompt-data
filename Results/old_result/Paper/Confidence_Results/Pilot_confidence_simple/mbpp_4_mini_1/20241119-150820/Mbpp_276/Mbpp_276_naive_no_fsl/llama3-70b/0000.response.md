To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and the specification given.

### Problem Description
The function is supposed to take in the radius and height of a cylinder and return the volume. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi \times r^2 \times h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
```

### Analysis
1. **Module Import**: The code uses `math.pi`, but there's no import statement for the `math` module. This will cause a `NameError` when the function is called because `math` is not defined.

2. **Input Validation**: The function does not handle cases where the inputs are negative numbers or zero. According to the geometric context, the radius and height of a cylinder cannot be negative or zero (a radius of 0 would result in a volume of 0, which may or may not be desired based on the problem description).

3. **Type Checking**: The function does not check if the inputs are of the correct type (e.g., ensuring that `radius` and `height` are numbers).

### Conclusion
Since the program can fail due to the missing import statement and improperly handles edge cases (like negative and zero values), it does not meet the correctness requirement for every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

### Reasoning
Specifically, if we try to run `func_1(3, 5)` without importing the `math` module, it will raise a `NameError`. Additionally, if we call `func_1(-3, 5)`, it will produce an incorrect result, since negative radii do not make sense in the context of a cylinder's geometry. Hence, the function is incorrect based on these considerations.
