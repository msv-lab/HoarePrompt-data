Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the addition of a tuple to a list. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`. It converts the tuple to a list using `list(tup)` and then concatenates this list to the original list `lst` using the `+` operator. 

This operation correctly handles the addition of the elements in the tuple to the list, regardless of the types of elements within the tuple or the list. The use of `list(tup)` ensures that the elements of the tuple are expanded and added individually to the list.

Examples of how the function works:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3], (4, 5))` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
2. `func_1([], (1, 2, 3))` returns `[1, 2, 3]`
3. `func_1([1, 2], ())` returns `[1, 2]`

All potential edge cases, such as empty lists and tuples, are handled correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program meets the problem's requirements in all cases.
