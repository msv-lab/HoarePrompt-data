To determine the correctness of the provided program, we must analyze whether it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The task is to return the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function correctly checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If so, it returns 0, which is correct because there are no prime numbers less than 2.

2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - The program implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes. It initializes a list `is_prime` where each index represents whether the number is considered prime.
   - It marks 0 and 1 as not prime (`False`).
   - It correctly iterates through potential prime candidates up to the square root of `n` and marks their multiples as not prime.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the sum of the `is_prime` list, which gives the count of numbers marked as prime.

### Edge Cases to Consider

- The function should return the correct number of primes for various inputs, including edge cases. 
- Since the function is designed to return the number of primes less than `n`, we should check specific values:
  - For `n = 0`: The function returns 0 (correct).
  - For `n = 1`: The function again returns 0 (correct).
  - For `n = 2`: The function returns 0 (correct).
  - For `n = 3`: There is 1 prime number (which is 2), so the function should return 1.
  - For `n = 4`: There are 2 prime numbers (2 and 3), so the function should return 2.

### Testing the Edge Cases

Let's test the edge cases:

```python
assert func_1(0) == 0  # Correct: No primes < 0
assert func_1(1) == 0  # Correct: No primes < 1
assert func_1(2) == 0  # Correct: No primes < 2
assert func_1(3) == 1  # Correct: Only 2 is prime < 3
assert func_1(4) == 2  # Correct: 2, 3 are primes < 4
```

### Conclusion

Since the function behaves correctly for all tested edge cases and adheres to the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number for all tested cases.
