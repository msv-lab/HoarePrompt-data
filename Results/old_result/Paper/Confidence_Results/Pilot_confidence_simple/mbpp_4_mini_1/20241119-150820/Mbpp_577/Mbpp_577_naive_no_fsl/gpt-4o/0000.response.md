Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where `n` is 0 or 1 correctly. According to the definition of factorial, both `0!` and `1!` equal 1. Therefore, the last digit of the factorial for these inputs should be 1, but the program does not explicitly handle these cases. 

For example:
- `func_1(0)` should return `1`, but it is not covered in the program.
- `func_1(1)` should also return `1`, but it too is not handled correctly.

Since the program fails for the inputs `n = 0` and `n = 1`, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
