Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. This directly correlates with the requirement to determine if there is no profit and no loss. The given assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected:

1. `func_1(1500, 1200)` returns `False`, indicating a loss (correct).
2. `func_1(100, 100)` returns `True`, indicating no profit and no loss (correct).
3. `func_1(2000, 5000)` returns `False`, indicating a profit (correct).

The function correctly identifies the cases for profit, loss, and breakeven scenarios. Since it handles the relevant cases and meets the problem description without any edge cases failing, the program is correct.
