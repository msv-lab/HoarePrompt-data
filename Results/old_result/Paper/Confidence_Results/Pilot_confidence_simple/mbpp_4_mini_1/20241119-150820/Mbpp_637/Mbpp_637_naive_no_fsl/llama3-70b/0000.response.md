Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`, which is the condition for having no profit and no loss. 

In every potential case:
- If `cost_price` and `selling_price` are equal (e.g., both are 100), the function returns `True`.
- If `cost_price` is less than `selling_price` (e.g., cost_price = 100, selling_price = 150), it returns `False`, indicating a profit.
- If `cost_price` is greater than `selling_price` (e.g., cost_price = 150, selling_price = 100), it returns `False`, indicating a loss.

Since the function behaves correctly for all possible input scenarios and adheres to the problem description, it is deemed correct.
