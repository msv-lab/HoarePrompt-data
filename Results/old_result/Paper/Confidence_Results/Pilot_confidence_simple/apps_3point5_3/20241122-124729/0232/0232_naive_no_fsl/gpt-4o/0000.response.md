Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes the input as described in the problem statement, calculates the desired and current counts of lightsabers, and then iterates through the Jedi Knights to find the contiguous interval with the prescribed color counts. The logic used in the program seems to follow the problem description accurately. The program checks if the current counts match the desired counts for all colors and returns "YES" if they do. Otherwise, it continues to update the counts until it finds the interval or reaches the end. Overall, the program logic appears to be correct for all potential cases.
