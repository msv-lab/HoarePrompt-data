Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values, calculates the color counts of the Jedi Knights, and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals to check if there is an interval that matches the desired color counts. The program outputs "YES" if such an interval is found, and "NO" otherwise. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
