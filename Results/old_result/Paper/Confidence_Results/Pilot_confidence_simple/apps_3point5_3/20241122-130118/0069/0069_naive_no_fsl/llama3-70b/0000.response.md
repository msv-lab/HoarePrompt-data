Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the balance of the given string $s$, checks if the balance matches the desired balance $x$, and then calculates the number of prefixes accordingly. The logic used in the program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, and the output is as expected for the provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
