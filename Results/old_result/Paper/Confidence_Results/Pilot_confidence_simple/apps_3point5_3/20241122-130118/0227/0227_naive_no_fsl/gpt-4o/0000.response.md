Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the sorted input sequence and keeps track of the values that can be formed using the assigned variables. If a value cannot be formed using the existing assigned values, it increments the count of variables needed. The program then returns the minimum number of variables required.

The program handles all potential cases by considering all possible combinations of values that can be formed with the assigned variables. Since the logic is sound and there are no clear edge cases where the program would fail to produce the correct output, we can conclude that the program is correct.
