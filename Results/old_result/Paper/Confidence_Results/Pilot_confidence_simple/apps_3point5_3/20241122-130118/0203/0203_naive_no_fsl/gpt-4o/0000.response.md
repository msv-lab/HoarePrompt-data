Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It simulates the voting process by maintaining two queues for depublicans and remocrats, and repeatedly popping the front of each queue and adding the index back to the end of the queue based on the comparison of indices. The program correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on the final state of the queues. The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description for every input scenario.
