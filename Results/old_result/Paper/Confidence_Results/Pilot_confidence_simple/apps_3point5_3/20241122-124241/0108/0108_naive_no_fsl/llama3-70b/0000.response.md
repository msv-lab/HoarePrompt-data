Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program takes the input string and iterates through the characters of the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
2. For each character, it repeatedly replaces the character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet until that character is no longer present in the input string.
3. If the resulting string has a length of 26 (indicating that all characters from 'a' to 'z' are present in order), it prints the resulting string. Otherwise, it prints -1.
4. The program correctly handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the target 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' string, in which case it prints -1.
5. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, ensuring that the program will always output the correct result based on the given input.
