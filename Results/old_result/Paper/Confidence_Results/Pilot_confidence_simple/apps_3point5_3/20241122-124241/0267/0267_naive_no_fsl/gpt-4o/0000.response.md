Correctness: True

Explanation: The program defines two functions, func_1 and func_2, where func_1 checks if a number contains at most k different digits, and func_2 calculates the sum of numbers from l to r that satisfy the condition in func_1. The program then reads input, calls func_2, and prints the result. The program iterates through all numbers from l to r and checks if each number satisfies the condition using func_1. It then correctly calculates the sum of valid numbers and returns the result modulo 998244353. The program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
