Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program takes two integers x and y as input, then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The formula used in the program to calculate the minimum number of seconds is correct based on the problem description. The program correctly handles the integer division and modulo operations to determine the number of operations needed. Additionally, the program logic considers all possible cases and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct for all inputs.
