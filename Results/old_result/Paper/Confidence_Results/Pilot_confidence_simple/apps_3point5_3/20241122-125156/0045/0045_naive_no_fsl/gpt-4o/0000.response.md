Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the minimum possible sum of k numbers in a strictly increasing sequence, which is k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. If the minimum sum is greater than n, then it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
3. It then calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It calculates the remainder by subtracting d * minimum sum from n.
5. It then constructs the sequence by creating k numbers in a strictly increasing manner by multiplying d with (i + 1) for each element.
6. It then distributes the remainder among the sequence elements by incrementing each element starting from the last one until the remainder becomes 0.
7. Finally, it prints the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise -1.

The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides a valid solution for finding a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers with the maximum common divisor when given a positive integer n.
