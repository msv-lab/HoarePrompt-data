Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly determines whether there exists a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers that sum up to n and have the maximal greatest common divisor. It handles cases where n < k, outputs -1 if such a sequence does not exist, and prints the resulting sequence if it does exist. It iterates through the numbers from 1 to k to construct the sequence, ensuring that each number is less than or equal to n, and then outputs the sequence as space-separated values. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output for all potential cases.
