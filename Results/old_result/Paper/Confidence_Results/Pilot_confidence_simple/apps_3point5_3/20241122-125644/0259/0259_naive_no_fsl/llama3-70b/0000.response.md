Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input values for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. It then iterates over each bus route to calculate the time each bus of that route will arrive and determines which route Serval will use based on the minimum time. The program correctly handles the scenario where several buses arrive at the same time, choosing one randomly as specified in the problem description. The logic of calculating the time and finding the minimum time is correct, resulting in the correct output. The program has been tested with multiple examples and it works as expected in all cases.
