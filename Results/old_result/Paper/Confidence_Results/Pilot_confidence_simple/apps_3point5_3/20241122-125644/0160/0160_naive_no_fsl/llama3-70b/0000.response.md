Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements of A and then iterates through all the divisors of the gcd to find the maximum divisor that divides every element of A. This logic covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
