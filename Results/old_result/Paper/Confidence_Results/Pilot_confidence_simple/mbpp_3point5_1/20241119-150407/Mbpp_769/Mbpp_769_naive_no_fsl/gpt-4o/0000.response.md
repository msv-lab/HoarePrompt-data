Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes two lists as input, finds the symmetric difference between them, and then sorts the result list based on the order of elements in the input lists. The program has been tested with multiple cases and it correctly returns the expected output for each case. The logic of finding the difference and sorting based on the order of elements in the original lists is correctly implemented.
