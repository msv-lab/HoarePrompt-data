Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program defines a function that takes a string as input and replaces all spaces with '%20' using the `replace` method. This implementation correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases as it handles all spaces in the input string and replaces them with '%20'. Since the program works as expected for all inputs, the correctness is True.
