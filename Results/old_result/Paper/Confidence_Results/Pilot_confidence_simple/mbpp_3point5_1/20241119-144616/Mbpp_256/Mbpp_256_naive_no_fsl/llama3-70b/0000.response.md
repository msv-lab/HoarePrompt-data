Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `is_prime(num: int) -> bool` to check if a given number is prime. It then loops through numbers from 2 to n (exclusive) and counts the prime numbers. The logic of checking for prime numbers and counting them seems correct. The code handles the case when the input number is less than 2 and returns 0 prime numbers as expected. It also correctly counts the prime numbers less than the given number. The code covers all potential cases, and there are no apparent scenarios where it would fail to return the correct count of prime numbers less than the input number.
