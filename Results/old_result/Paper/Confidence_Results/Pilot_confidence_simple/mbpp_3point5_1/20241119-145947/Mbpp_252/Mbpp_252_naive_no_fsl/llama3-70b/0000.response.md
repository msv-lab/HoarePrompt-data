Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it is missing the import statement for the `cmath` module. The `cmath` module is required to access the `phase()` function which calculates the phase angle of a complex number. 

To fix this issue, the program should be updated as follows:
```
import cmath

def func_1(c):
    return (abs(c), cmath.phase(c))
```
