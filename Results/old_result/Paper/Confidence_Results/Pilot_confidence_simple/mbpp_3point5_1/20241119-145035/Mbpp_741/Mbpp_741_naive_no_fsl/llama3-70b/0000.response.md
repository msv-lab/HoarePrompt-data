Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and then checks if all the characters in the string are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is equal to 1. This logic correctly determines if all characters in the string are the same. This will work for all input strings, including empty strings, single-character strings, and strings with multiple repeating characters.
