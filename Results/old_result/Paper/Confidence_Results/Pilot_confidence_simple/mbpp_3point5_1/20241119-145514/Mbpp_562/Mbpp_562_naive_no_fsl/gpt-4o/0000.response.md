Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. It iterates through each sublist, compares the length of the current sublist with the maximum length found so far, and updates the `max_length` variable accordingly. Finally, it returns the `max_length`.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios such as:
1. A list of sublists with different lengths.
2. A list containing sublists with the same length.
3. A list with sublists of increasing lengths.

In each of these cases, the program correctly identifies the length of the longest sublist and returns the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
