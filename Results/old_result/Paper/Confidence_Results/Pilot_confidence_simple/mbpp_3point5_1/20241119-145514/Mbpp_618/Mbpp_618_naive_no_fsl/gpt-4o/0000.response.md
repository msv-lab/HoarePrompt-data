Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes two lists as input and divides the elements of the lists element-wise. The function then uses list comprehension along with the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both lists simultaneously and perform the division operation.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios including lists of different lengths and floating-point division. All the test cases pass successfully and the output matches the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
