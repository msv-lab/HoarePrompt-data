Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program first checks if the two input lists have the same length, as required by the problem description. If they are not of the same length, a ValueError is raised. Then, the program divides the elements of the two lists element-wise using a list comprehension with zip(). This implementation correctly handles the division of two lists element-wise and ensures that the lists must be of the same length, as described in the problem statement.
