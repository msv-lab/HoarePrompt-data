Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, then uses the built-in `count` method of the tuple to count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

The program handles various scenarios correctly, including:
- Counting occurrences of elements that are present multiple times in the tuple.
- Returning zero when the element is not present in the tuple.
- Working with different data types (e.g., integers, strings, tuples, lists) as elements in the tuple.

Since the `count` method is designed to work with all hashable types and the function adheres to the requirements of the problem statement without any missing logic or edge cases, I cannot identify any potential cases where the function would not work as expected. Thus, the program is correct.
