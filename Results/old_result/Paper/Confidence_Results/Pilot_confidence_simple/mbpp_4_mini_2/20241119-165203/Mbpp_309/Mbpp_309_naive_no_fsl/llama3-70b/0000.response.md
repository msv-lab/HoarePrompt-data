Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to find the maximum of two numbers using the built-in `max()` function, which handles various types of inputs, including integers, floats, and even compatible types, returning the larger one. There are no edge cases or potential cases where this implementation would fail to meet the problem description, as the `max()` function is designed to handle diverse scenarios effectively. Therefore, the implementation is correct for all potential cases.
