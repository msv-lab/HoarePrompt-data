To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and check whether it fulfills the requirement of transforming a list of lists into two separate lists.

### Problem Description Recap:
The function should take a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and return a list of two lists:
- The first list should contain the first element of each sublist.
- The second list should contain the second element of each sublist.

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list((element[0] for element in list_of_lists)), list((element[1] for element in list_of_lists))]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Expectations**: The input is expected to be a list of lists, and each sublist must have exactly two elements. If the input does not meet this requirement, the function could throw an error (e.g., IndexError) when attempting to access `element[0]` or `element[1]`.

2. **Output Structure**: The output is structured as a list containing two lists. The first should contain all the first elements, and the second should contain all the second elements of the sublists.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Input**: If the input is an empty list (`[]`), the function will return `[[], []]`, which is correct.
- **Single Sublist**: For an input like `[[1, 2]]`, the output will correctly be `[[1], [2]]`.
- **Missing Elements**: If a sublist is missing elements (e.g., `[[1]]`), the program will throw an IndexError when trying to access the second element.
- **Non-List Elements**: If any element of `list_of_lists` is not a list or does not have exactly two elements, it will also lead to errors.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle cases where the sublists do not contain exactly two elements. Therefore, it is not robust against all potential cases and does not adhere strictly to the problem description's requirements.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails when it encounters a sublist that does not have exactly two elements, leading to an IndexError. For example, `func_1([[1]])` would result in an error.
