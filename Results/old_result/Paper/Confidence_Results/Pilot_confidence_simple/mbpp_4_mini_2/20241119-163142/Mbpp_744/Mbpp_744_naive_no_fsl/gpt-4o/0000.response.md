Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if the given tuple contains any `None` value. It iterates through each item in the tuple, and if it finds an item that is `None`, it returns `True`. If it finishes checking all items without finding `None`, it returns `False`. 

The assertions provided demonstrate the expected behavior:
- `func_1((10, 4, 5, 6, None))` returns `True` because there is a `None` value.
- `func_1((7, 8, 9, 11, 14))` returns `False` because there are no `None` values.
- `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, None))` returns `True` because there is a `None` value.

No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential inputs.
