To determine the correctness of the provided program, we first need to analyze how it addresses the problem of counting pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Understanding XOR and Even Numbers
1. The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or both are odd.
    - Even XOR Even = Even
    - Odd XOR Odd = Even
    - Even XOR Odd = Odd

### Program Analysis
The program calculates:
- The count of even integers (`even_count`).
- The count of odd integers (`odd_count`).
- The number of valid pairs formed by even integers and odd integers:
  - The number of even pairs is calculated using the formula `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`.
  - The number of odd pairs is calculated using the formula `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.

Finally, it returns the sum of these two counts.

### Checking the Assertions
The assertions in the program are:
1. `func_1([5, 4, 7, 2, 1]) == 4`
2. `func_1([7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]) == 9`
3. `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1`

Let's evaluate these assertions:
- **First case**: `[5, 4, 7, 2, 1]`
  - Even numbers: `[4, 2]` → 2 even numbers, which can form `1` pair.
  - Odd numbers: `[5, 7, 1]` → 3 odd numbers, which can form `3` pairs.
  - Total pairs = `1 + 3 = 4` (Correct).

- **Second case**: `[7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]`
  - Even numbers: `[2, 8, 0]` → 3 even numbers, which can form `3` pairs.
  - Odd numbers: `[7, 1, 5, 11]` → 4 odd numbers, which can form `6` pairs.
  - Total pairs = `3 + 6 = 9` (Correct).

- **Third case**: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Even numbers: `[2]` → 1 even number, which can form `0` pairs.
  - Odd numbers: `[1, 3]` → 2 odd numbers, which can form `1` pair.
  - Total pairs = `0 + 1 = 1` (Correct).

### Testing Edge Cases
To ensure the correctness of the program, let's consider some additional edge cases:
1. **Empty list**: `func_1([])` should return `0` because there are no pairs.
2. **Single element list**: `func_1([1])` should return `0` because one element cannot form any pairs.
3. **List with all even numbers**: `func_1([2, 4, 6])` should return `3` because we can form pairs from all even numbers (3 choose 2).
4. **List with all odd numbers**: `func_1([1, 3, 5])` should return `3` for the same reason as above.

### Conclusion
The program appears to handle the cases correctly as per the problem description and has been verified with both the provided assertions and additional edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
