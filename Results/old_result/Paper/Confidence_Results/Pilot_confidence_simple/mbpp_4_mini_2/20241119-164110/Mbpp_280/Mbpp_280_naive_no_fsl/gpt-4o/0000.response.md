Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input. It then iterates through the array using `enumerate`, checking if each value matches the specified element. 

If a match is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`, indicating that the element is not present in the array.

All potential edge cases appear to be handled:

1. If the element is not present, the function correctly returns `(False, -1)`.
2. If the element is the first item in the array, it correctly returns `(True, 0)`.
3. If the element is the last item in the array, it returns the correct index.

I could not find any cases where this function does not work as described. Therefore, the function behaves as intended for all scenarios based on the problem requirements.
