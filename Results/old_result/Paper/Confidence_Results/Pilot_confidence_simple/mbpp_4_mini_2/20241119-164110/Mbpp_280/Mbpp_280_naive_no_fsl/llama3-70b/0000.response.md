Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element as inputs and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is present in the array, along with the index of the element if it is found, or -1 if the element is not found.

Here's a breakdown of how the code meets the requirements:

1. **Element Found**: If the element is present in the array, the program iterates through the array and returns `(True, i)`, where `i` is the index of the found element. This satisfies the requirement to indicate both presence and position.

2. **Element Not Found**: If the element is not found after checking all elements, the program returns `(False, -1)`, which meets the requirement to indicate absence.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as an empty array, where it will correctly return `(False, -1)` since there are no elements to find. 

I cannot identify any input or potential case where the program would not work as expected based on the provided description. Therefore, the program is correct.
