Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts a given string to uppercase using the built-in `upper()` method. It has been tested with various input strings, and all assertions pass as expected, producing the correct uppercase versions of the strings. 

Additionally, the `upper()` method handles different cases, including:
- Lowercase letters
- Mixed-case letters
- Empty strings (which would return an empty string)
- Strings that are already in uppercase (which would return the same string)

Since I could not find any input case where the function does not behave as described in the problem statement, the program is correct.
