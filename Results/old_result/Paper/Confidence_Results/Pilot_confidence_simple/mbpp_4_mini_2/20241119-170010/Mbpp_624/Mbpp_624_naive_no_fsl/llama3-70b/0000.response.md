Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(s: str) -> str` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to convert a given string to uppercase. It utilizes the built-in string method `.upper()`, which accurately transforms all lowercase letters in the string to uppercase letters while leaving any non-letter characters unchanged.

I have considered various potential cases, including:
- An empty string (`""`), which remains `""` when converted to uppercase.
- A string with all lowercase letters (`"hello"`), which correctly converts to `"HELLO"`.
- A string that contains a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters (`"HeLLo"`), which converts to `"HELLO"`.
- A string with non-letter characters (`"hello123!"`), which correctly converts to `"HELLO123!"`.

In all potential cases I examined, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct for all inputs.
