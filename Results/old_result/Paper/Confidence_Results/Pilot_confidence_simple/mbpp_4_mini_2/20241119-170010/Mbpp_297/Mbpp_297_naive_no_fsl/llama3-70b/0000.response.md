Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively checking each element of the input list. If an element is a list, it calls itself to flatten that sublist, and if it's not a list, it appends the element directly to the `flat_list`. This approach will work for any level of nesting and for various types of elements within the lists.

Examples:
1. For input `[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]]`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the correct flattened structure.
2. For input `[[], [1, 2], [3, [4]]]`, the output is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, correctly handling empty lists.

I cannot find an example of the code not working as expected, meaning it meets the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
