Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20'. The `str.replace` method is appropriate for this task, and it handles all cases of spaces in the string, including leading, trailing, and multiple consecutive spaces. 

For example:
- Input: "Hello World" would yield "Hello%20World".
- Input: "  Leading and trailing  " would yield "%20Leading%20and%20trailing%20".

Since no edge cases or inputs are found that would cause the program to misbehave according to the problem description, the implementation is verified to be correct in all scenarios.
