To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(tup):
    for elem in tup:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            return tup.index(elem)
    return len(tup)
```

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the number of elements that occur before a tuple element in the given tuple.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function iterates over each element in the input tuple (`tup`).
2. It checks if the current element (`elem`) is a tuple using `isinstance(elem, tuple)`.
3. If a tuple is found, it returns the index of that tuple in the original tuple using `tup.index(elem)`.
4. If no tuple is found during iteration, it returns the length of the tuple.

### Key Points of Consideration:
1. **Multiple Tuple Elements**: If the tuple contains multiple tuple elements, the function will only return the index of the first tuple it encounters, which may not meet the requirement if we are looking for all tuple elements.
2. **Empty Tuple**: If the input tuple is empty, the function will return `0`, which might not be the expected behavior since there is no tuple element to check against.
3. **No Tuple Elements**: If the tuple contains no tuple elements (e.g., all integers), it will return the length of the tuple, which does not correspond to finding a tuple element before anything.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1**: An input of `(1, 2, (3, 4), 5)` should return `2` because there are two elements before the first tuple `(3, 4)`.
- **Case 2**: An input of `(1, 2, 3, 4)` should return `4` but the function does not find any tuple, leading to a return of the length of the tuple instead of indicating no tuple was found.
- **Case 3**: An input of `()` (empty tuple) returns `0`, but this should ideally indicate that there are no tuple elements.

Given these considerations, the implementation does not correctly handle cases where no tuple is present or multiple tuples are found.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly with the handling of non-tuple elements and multiple tuple elements.

Correctness: **False**
