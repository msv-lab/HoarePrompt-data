Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1(lst, tpl)` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converting the tuple into a list and concatenating it with the original list. The assertions provided test the function with different inputs, and in each case, the function returns the expected output.

The logic of adding a tuple to a list is correctly implemented, and no edge cases are missed. The function handles any tuple correctly by converting it to a list first, ensuring that the concatenation works as intended.

Since I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description, the program is considered correct.
