Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the input number `n` is negative. According to the problem description, we are supposed to find the last digit of the factorial of a given number. However, the factorial is not defined for negative numbers. 

For example, if we call `func_1(-1)`, the code does not have a condition to handle this input, and it will proceed to compute the factorial inappropriately, leading to incorrect behavior. The function should ideally raise an error or return a specific value indicating that the input is not valid.

Since there is at least one input case (negative numbers) where the program does not behave as required by the problem description, the correctness of the program is false.
