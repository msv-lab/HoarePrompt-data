To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

**Problem Description**: Write a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the volume.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
```

### Analysis:

1. **Volume of a Cylinder Formula**: The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
   \[
   V = \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The program implements this formula correctly.

2. **Use of `math.pi`**: The program uses `math.pi`, which is the correct mathematical constant for \(\pi\). However, the `math` module is not imported in the provided code. This will raise a `NameError` when the function is called because `math` will be undefined.

3. **Input Types**: The function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` might be negative or non-numeric. For instance:
   - If `radius` is negative, it should likely return an error or a specific value, as a physical cylinder cannot have a negative radius.
   - Similarly, if `height` is negative, it should also return an error.

### Example of Failure:
- If you call the function with negative values:
  ```python
  func_1(-2, 5)  # This should raise an error or handle the case explicitly.
  ```

### Conclusion:
Due to the missing import statement and the lack of handling for negative or non-numeric inputs, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. 

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to account for basic error handling and correctness in terms of physical representations (i.e., negative dimensions).
