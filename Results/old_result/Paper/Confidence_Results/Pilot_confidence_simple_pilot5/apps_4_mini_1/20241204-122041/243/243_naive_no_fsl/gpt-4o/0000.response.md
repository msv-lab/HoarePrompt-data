To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze how it functions and whether it meets the requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find all positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. The number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) is determined by the number of pairs of factors of 5 and 2, with the limiting factor generally being the number of 5s since they are less frequent.

### Code Breakdown
1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by counting how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \( n \). It performs this by repeatedly dividing \( n \) by powers of 5.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to locate all integers \( n \) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) is exactly \( m \).
   - It sets a search range from 0 to \( 5 \times (m + 1) \) and checks the number of trailing zeroes for midpoints.
   - If \( zeroes \) equals \( m \), it attempts to find the range of integers that produce exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.

### Consider Possible Edge Cases
- **Case when \( m = 1 \)**: The output should be `5` and then `5 6 7 8 9`, which is correctly handled.
- **Case when \( m = 5 \)**: The output should be `0`, which is also correctly handled.
- **Case when \( m = 0 \)**: The minimum trailing zeroes is \( 0 \) which corresponds to \( n = 0 \), but since \( n \) must be positive, the program does not have a case for returning results for \( m = 0 \). 

### Important Observations
- The program does not handle the case where \( m = 0 \) correctly because it only operates for \( 1 \leq m \leq 100,000 \). However, according to the problem description, \( m = 0 \) should be considered (even though the given constraints state \( m \geq 1 \)).
- The function `func_2` is designed to return results for positive integers, yet it will not return anything meaningful when \( m \) exceeds the maximum possible trailing zeroes for large \( n \).

### Conclusion
Given the nature of the task, even though the program handles the prescribed cases in the examples correctly, the lack of handling for the edge case \( m = 0 \) and potential edge cases for larger values of \( m \) result in the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
