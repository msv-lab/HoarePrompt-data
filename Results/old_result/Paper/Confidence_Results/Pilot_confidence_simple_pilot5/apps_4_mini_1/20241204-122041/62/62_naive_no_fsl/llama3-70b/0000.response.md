Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases as per the problem description. It reads the inputs for both numbers, converts them to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the resulting decimal values. 

The key points validating its correctness are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of digits and the base for both numbers, ensuring they are in the specified range.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The `func_1` function converts the digits from the specified base to decimal correctly. It accumulates the result by multiplying the current result by the base and adding the next digit.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them and prints the appropriate relational symbol ('<', '>', or '=').

No edge cases have been overlooked, and since the function handles the maximum limits of digits and bases as specified in the input constraints, no scenario where the program would fail to meet the problem description can be identified. Thus, the solution works as expected for all valid inputs.
