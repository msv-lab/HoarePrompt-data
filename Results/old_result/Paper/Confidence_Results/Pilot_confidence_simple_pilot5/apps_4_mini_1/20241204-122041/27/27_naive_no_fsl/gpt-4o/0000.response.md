Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads three real numbers x, y, and z, computes all twelve specified expressions, identifies the maximum value among them, and then prints the corresponding expression in the required format.

The program's logic includes:
1. Reading the input values and converting them to floats.
2. Calculating each of the twelve specified expressions.
3. Using the `max` function with a key that selects the first element of each tuple (the computed value) to find the maximum value and its corresponding expression.
4. Printing the expression associated with the maximum value.

All requirements from the problem description are satisfied:
- The expressions are calculated according to the specified rules.
- The output format is maintained as described.
- The program handles the range of inputs correctly (from 0.1 to 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point).

Overall, no potential cases were found where the program fails to meet the problem requirements. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
