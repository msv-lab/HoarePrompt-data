Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to properly account for the situation where there are more `-` operations than `+` operations, in which case the program should allow for a certain number of stones to be present initially to avoid taking a stone from an empty pile.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
---
```
In this case, the program will output `0`, which is correct because if Vasya started with 3 stones, he can end with 0 stones after taking all 3. However, if the input were:
```
3
--+
```
According to the logic provided, the program will still output `0` because it simply counts the number of pluses and minuses. However, Vasya could not start with fewer than 2 stones because he would not be able to take a stone for the first two operations.

Thus, the program does not accurately calculate the minimum number of stones that must be present initially to allow for all operations to be valid. Therefore, it is incorrect.
