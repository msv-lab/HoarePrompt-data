Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly count the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts such that it is possible to form a rectangle but impossible to form a square. 

One potential case where the program fails is when `n = 8`. According to the problem description, one valid way to split the stick would be `2, 2, 2, 2`, which can form a square, thus making it invalid. However, the program does not handle the condition correctly where it should exclude any case that can form a square. The program's logic allows for combinations that include squares, failing to meet the requirement of the problem.

Moreover, for `n = 10`, valid combinations like `1, 1, 4, 4` or `2, 2, 3, 3` exist, which can form rectangles but not squares, and the program's counting logic may not account for all valid combinations correctly.

These inconsistencies indicate that the program does not accurately implement the requirements outlined in the problem statement.
