To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and consider various edge cases.

### Problem Understanding:
Polycarp can work on n tasks, each with k subtasks, and he has M minutes to maximize his points. For each completed task (all k subtasks), he earns k + 1 points. He can also earn points for solving subtasks from remaining tasks based on the time he has left.

### Code Functionality:
1. The program calculates the total time needed to solve all subtasks for a single task (`total_time_per_task`).
2. It iterates through the number of complete tasks (`complete_tasks`) from 0 to n, checking if the time used does not exceed M.
3. For each complete task, it calculates the points earned and attempts to solve as many remaining subtasks from the remaining time.
4. The program uses a greedy approach to maximize the number of subtasks solved with the remaining time.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Incomplete Handling of Remaining Tasks**: The logic for calculating `subtasks_solved` based on the remaining time may not correctly reflect the maximum points achievable if it does not properly account for the distribution of the subtasks across the remaining tasks.
2. **Missing Lower Bound Check for Points**: The program doesn't handle cases where certain configurations of time and tasks lead to no points being earned because the subtasks cannot be completed within the remaining time.

### Test Cases for Validation:
1. **Case with No Time**: If M = 0, the program should return 0 points since no tasks or subtasks can be completed.
2. **Case with Large M and Small Task Times**: If M is large enough to complete multiple tasks, we need to ensure that the program accurately counts all possible combinations of completing tasks and subtasks.
3. **Edge Cases with High Values of k**: If k is at its maximum value (45), we need to ensure that the program can evaluate the maximum points correctly without missing combinations.

### Example Failing Case:
Consider the following scenario:
```plaintext
Input:
1 3 5
5 1 1
```
In this case:
- Polycarp has 1 task with 3 subtasks taking 5, 1, and 1 minutes respectively. 
- With 5 minutes, he can complete the first subtask of the task (1 point) and still have 4 minutes left. He can solve the other two subtasks (1 minute each) and earn 3 additional points.
- Expected output: 4 points.
- The program may count only 1 point for completing the first task if it does not consider the completion of subtasks properly.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, there are cases where the program may not yield the correct maximum points due to how it calculates the subtasks solved and does not properly utilize the time remaining.

Correctness: **False**
