To verify the correctness of the given program, I need to analyze its logic and check if it adheres to the problem description thoroughly.

### Problem Understanding:
Neko is looking for the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. If multiple \( k \) values yield the same minimum LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be returned.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. The program starts by reading inputs \( a \) and \( b \).
2. It initializes \( k \) to 0 and computes the initial LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) using `func_2`.
3. The program enters a while loop, incrementing \( k \) until it finds a situation where the LCM does not decrease further.
4. The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD), while `func_2` calculates the LCM using the relationship:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)}
   \]

### Potential Issues:
- The loop continues to increment \( k \) until it finds an LCM that is not smaller than the previous one, but this method does not guarantee that it will always find the minimum LCM accurately.
- Specifically, there may be situations where a smaller \( k \) after \( k-1 \) leads to a LCM that could have been smaller than previously calculated LCM values.
- The solution could potentially skip the optimal \( k \) values if the increments lead to a local minimum without checking all necessary combinations.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider the example where \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \):
- For \( k = 0 \): \( \text{LCM}(1, 2) = 2 \)
- For \( k = 1 \): \( \text{LCM}(2, 3) = 6 \)
- For \( k = 2 \): \( \text{LCM}(3, 4) = 12 \)
- For \( k = 3 \): \( \text{LCM}(4, 5) = 20 \)
- The loop would stop after \( k = 0 \) because \( k = 1 \) results in a higher LCM. Hence the output would be 0, which is correct. 

Now consider \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 15 \):
- For \( k = 0 \): \( \text{LCM}(10, 15) = 30 \)
- For \( k = 1 \): \( \text{LCM}(11, 16) = 176 \)
- For \( k = 2 \): \( \text{LCM}(12, 17) = 204 \)
- For \( k = 3 \): \( \text{LCM}(13, 18) = 234 \)
- For \( k = 4 \): \( \text{LCM}(14, 19) = 266 \)
- For \( k = 5 \): \( \text{LCM}(15, 20) = 60 \)
- For \( k = 6 \): \( \text{LCM}(16, 21) = 336 \)
- The loop would miss the optimal \( k = 5 \) because it didn't consider all potential values of \( k \) after an increase.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program could potentially skip over optimal \( k \) values by stopping the search prematurely, it does not guarantee finding the minimal LCM for all possible cases.

Correctness: **False** 

**Reason**: The program can miss the optimal \( k \) because it breaks out of the loop when it finds an LCM that is not less than the previous minimum, potentially skipping better options.
