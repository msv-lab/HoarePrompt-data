Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases. While it checks a couple of conditions, it fails to consider the total number of coins that can be gifted by each friend and whether it is possible for all friends to give different coins.

For example, letâ€™s consider the input: 

```
N = 5
M = 5
K = 2
L = 4
```

In this case:
- Ivan has 2 coins already (out of 5).
- There are 5 friends, so they want to gift coins.
- At least 4 coins must be new.

According to the program:
- It checks `M >= N - K + 1`, which translates to `5 >= 5 - 2 + 1`, or `5 >= 4`, which is true.
- It also checks `M >= L`, which translates to `5 >= 4`, which is also true.

Since both conditions are satisfied, the program outputs `1`. However, if each friend gifts 1 coin, they can only give a maximum of `5 - 2 = 3` new coins (since Ivan already has 2). Therefore, it is actually impossible to satisfy the requirement of at least `4` new coins.

Thus, the correct output should be `-1`, but the program incorrectly outputs `1`. This demonstrates that the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine whether the gifting conditions can be met.
