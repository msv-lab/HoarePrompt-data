Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem of determining the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make the compote in the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. It reads inputs for the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used while ensuring that there are enough apples and pears to maintain the required ratios. This is done using:
   - `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which calculates:
     - `a` is the total lemons available.
     - `b // 2` checks if there are at least twice as many apples as lemons.
     - `c // 4` checks if there are at least four times as many pears as lemons.
3. The total is then computed as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which correctly adds the total number of fruits used in the compote.

To further validate correctness:
- The function correctly handles cases where there are not enough pears or apples by ensuring that `min_lemon` cannot exceed any of these calculated minimums.
- For the special case when there are insufficient fruits to make any compote (i.e., when `min_lemon` is 0), it properly outputs 0.

The provided example cases work correctly:
- For inputs of (2, 5, 7), the output is 7, which is correct.
- For (4, 7, 13), the output is 21, which is correct.
- For (2, 3, 2), the output is 0, which is also correct.

Since no edge cases lead to incorrect outputs based on the problem description, the program is verified to be correct in all scenarios.
