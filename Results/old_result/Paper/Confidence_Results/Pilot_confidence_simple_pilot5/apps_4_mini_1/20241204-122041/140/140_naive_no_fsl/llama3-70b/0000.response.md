Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

The program checks if the graph contains a cycle and prints "NO" if it does, indicating that it's impossible to remove just one edge to make it acyclic. However, this logic is flawed. There are cases where a graph may contain cycles, but it is still possible to remove one edge to eliminate the cycle and make the graph acyclic.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 5
1 2
2 3
3 1
3 4
4 2
```

In this graph:
- There is a cycle formed by the edges `1 -> 2`, `2 -> 3`, and `3 -> 1`.
- However, if we remove the edge `3 -> 1`, the graph becomes acyclic.

The program would incorrectly output "NO" for this input, even though it is possible to make the graph acyclic with one edge removal. 

Thus, there are potential cases where the program does not work as expected, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
