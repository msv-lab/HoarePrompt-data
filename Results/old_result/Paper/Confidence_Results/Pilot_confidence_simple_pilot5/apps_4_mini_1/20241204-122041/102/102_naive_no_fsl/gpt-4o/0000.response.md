Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles on bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. 

1. It reads the inputs correctly.
2. It iterates over possible numbers of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`), calculating the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles.
3. It checks if the remaining money can be exactly divided by the cost of Bars bars (`b`), which would yield a non-negative integer `y`. 
4. If it finds such a pair (`x`, `y`), it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`.
5. If no valid pairs are found after exhausting the loop, it prints "NO".

The program accounts for all edge cases, including:
- When Vasya can buy only Bars bars or only Ber-Cola.
- When `n` is less than both `a` and `b`, in which case it correctly determines that it's impossible to spend exactly `n` burles.

I could not identify any cases where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements. Hence, I conclude that the program behaves as expected for all inputs within the specified constraints.
