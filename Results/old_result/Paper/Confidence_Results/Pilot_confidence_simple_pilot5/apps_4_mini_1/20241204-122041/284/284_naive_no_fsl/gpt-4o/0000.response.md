To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to find a positive integer \( m \) such that the expression \( n \cdot m + 1 \) results in a non-prime number, for a given positive integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)). 

### Analyzing the Program
1. **Input Handling:** The program reads a single integer \( n \).
2. **Looping Through Values:** It iterates \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
3. **Prime Checking Function:** The `func_1` function checks if a number \( x \) is prime.
   - It handles numbers less than or equal to 1 correctly by returning `False`.
   - It checks for prime numbers using trial division up to the square root of \( x \).
4. **Finding a Counterexample:** Inside the loop, if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime (using `func_1`), it prints \( m \) and exits the loop.

### Potential Issues
- The program is based on the assumption that there will always be a suitable \( m \) within the range that leads to a non-prime \( n \cdot m + 1 \).
- If the function `func_1` incorrectly identifies a prime number or fails for any specific case, it could potentially output the wrong \( m \) or fail to output any \( m \) at all.

### Testing Edge Cases
Let's consider specific small values of \( n \) to see if they lead the program to a non-prime output:
- For \( n = 1 \):
  - \( m = 1 \) gives \( 1 \cdot 1 + 1 = 2 \) (prime)
  - \( m = 2 \) gives \( 1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3 \) (prime)
  - \( m = 3 \) gives \( 1 \cdot 3 + 1 = 4 \) (not prime)
- For \( n = 2 \):
  - \( m = 1 \) gives \( 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3 \) (prime)
  - \( m = 2 \) gives \( 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5 \) (prime)
  - \( m = 3 \) gives \( 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7 \) (prime)
  - \( m = 4 \) gives \( 2 \cdot 4 + 1 = 9 \) (not prime)
  
This continues for other values of \( n \).

### Conclusion
Considering the algorithm and the described logic, the program appears to effectively find a suitable \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for all potential inputs from 1 to 1000. The check for primality is well-defined and should accurately identify non-prime numbers.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
