To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program carefully.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find a positive integer `m` such that for a given positive integer `n`, the expression `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. The constraints specify that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000`. The program must output at least one such `m`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly takes an integer input `n`.
2. **Loop for `m`**: It iterates `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. **Prime Checking Function**: The function `func_1` checks whether a number is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2, which is correct, and it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.
4. **Finding a Non-Prime**: The program checks if `n * m + 1` is not prime using `if not func_1(n * m + 1)`. If it finds such an `m`, it prints `m` and breaks the loop.

### Counterexample Analysis
Now, let's consider if there might be a case where the program fails to meet the requirements:

- For `n = 1`, the expression becomes `1 * m + 1`, which results in `m + 1`. Starting from `m=1`, we get:
  - For `m=1`, `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime).
  - For `m=2`, `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (prime).
  - For `m=3`, `1 * 3 + 1 = 4` (not prime).
  
  The output would be `3`, which is valid.

- For other values of `n` (like `2`, `3`, `4`, ..., `1000`), we can also find that there are non-prime outputs, as not all `n * m + 1` will be prime.

### Concerns About the Program
However, let's focus on the efficiency and completeness of the prime-checking logic:
- The program does not account for the case when `n * m + 1` can yield a prime number for all `m` from 1 to 1000. 
- The logic is designed to find a single `m` where `n * m + 1` is not prime, but there is no guarantee that it will find one before exhausting all options, especially if `n` is such that it can generate primes for many values of `m`.

Thus, the problem specifically states, "It is guaranteed the answer exists," meaning the program should find at least one valid `m`. However, there are certain combinations of `n` and `m` that could potentially lead to the program failing to output anything if the loop runs from 1 to 1000 and does not encounter a non-prime.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program, it is evident that:

- There are no explicit checks ensuring that a valid `m` is found for all inputs, as the loop can potentially run without finding a valid `m` under certain conditions.

Therefore, the program does not meet the correctness requirement for every potential input case.

Correctness: **False**
