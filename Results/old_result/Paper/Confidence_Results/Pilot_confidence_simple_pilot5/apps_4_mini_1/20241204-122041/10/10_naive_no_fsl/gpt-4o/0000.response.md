Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the counting of sofas in all cases. Specifically, it incorrectly counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa. 

To illustrate the failure, consider the following case:

Input:
```
3
3 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 2 2
2 1 2 2
1 1 1 1
```

Here, we have three sofas positioned as follows:
1. Sofa 1: covers cells (1, 1) and (1, 2)
2. Sofa 2: covers cells (1, 2) and (2, 2)
3. Sofa 3: covers cells (2, 1) and (2, 2)

With the counts:
- `cnt_l = 1` (1 sofa to the left of the target sofa)
- `cnt_r = 1` (1 sofa to the right of the target sofa)
- `cnt_t = 1` (1 sofa above the target sofa)
- `cnt_b = 1` (1 sofa below the target sofa)

In this case, if we analyze the sofas:
- Sofa 1 has 0 sofas to the left, 1 to the right, 0 above, and 1 below (incorrect count).
- Sofa 2 has 1 sofa to the left, 0 to the right, 1 above, and 0 below (incorrect count).
- Sofa 3 has 1 sofa to the left, 0 to the right, 0 above, and 1 below (incorrect count).

None of the sofas satisfy the criteria based on the conditions provided in the last line. However, the logic in the program may fail to determine that correctly due to incorrect counting logic, hence causing it to potentially output a sofa number instead of -1 when no correct sofa satisfies all conditions.

This demonstrates that the program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description for all possible cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
