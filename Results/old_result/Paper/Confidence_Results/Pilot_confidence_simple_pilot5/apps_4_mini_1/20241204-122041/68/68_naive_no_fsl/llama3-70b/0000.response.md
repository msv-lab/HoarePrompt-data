To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we will analyze the logic implemented in the code and compare it with the requirements outlined in the description. 

The problem requires us to determine the outcome based on the number of upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and uncertain votes (`z`). The possible outcomes can be:
1. "+" - if there are definitely more upvotes than downvotes.
2. "-" - if there are definitely more downvotes than upvotes.
3. "0" - if the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal with no uncertain votes.
4. "?" - if the outcome is uncertain due to the presence of uncertain votes (`z`).

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. The first condition checks if `x > y + z`. This means that even if all uncertain votes (`z`) went to the downvotes, there would still be more upvotes than downvotes. This condition correctly outputs "+".

2. The second condition checks if `x < y`. This means that there are more downvotes than upvotes, hence it correctly outputs "-".

3. The third condition checks if `x == y`. Here, it further checks if `z == 0`. If `z` is zero, then the counts of upvotes and downvotes are equal, thus it outputs "0". If `z` is not zero, it outputs "?" because uncertain votes could lead to different outcomes.

4. The final `else` outputs "?" in cases not covered by the previous checks, which would be scenarios where there is ambiguity due to the uncertain votes.

Now let's identify edge cases:

- For inputs like `3 7 1`: 
  - `x (3) < y (7)` which leads to a clear minus result.
- For `2 0 1`: 
  - `x (2) > y (0)` and even with `z (1)` being unknown these will result in more upvotes.
- For `1 1 0`: 
  - `x == y (1)`, and with `z (0)`, it correctly outputs "0".
- For `0 0 1`: 
  - Both upvotes and downvotes are zero, but with `z (1)` being uncertain, it correctly outputs "?".

After testing these and considering all possible scenarios, I can't identify any situation where the program does not match the criteria provided in the problem description.

Thus, the program covers all cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
