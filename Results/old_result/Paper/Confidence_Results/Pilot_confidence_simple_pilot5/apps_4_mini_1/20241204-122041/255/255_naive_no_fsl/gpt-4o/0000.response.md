Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. 

To illustrate the issue, let's consider the input case:

Input:
```
6
aaabbb
```

According to the problem description, the minimal number of operations to delete the string "aaabbb" would be 2:
1. Delete "aaa" in the first operation, resulting in "bbb".
2. In the second operation, delete "bbb", resulting in an empty string.

However, the implemented program counts the number of segments of contiguous different characters. In this case, the program would incorrectly output `3` because it counts the transition from 'a' to 'b' as an operation. 

Therefore, the logic of the program is flawed because it does not account for the fact that contiguous blocks of the same character can be deleted in one operation, regardless of the transitions between different characters. Thus, the current program does not meet the requirements of the problem for all potential cases.
