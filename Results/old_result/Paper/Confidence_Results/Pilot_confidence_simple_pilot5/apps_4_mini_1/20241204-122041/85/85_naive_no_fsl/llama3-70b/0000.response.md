Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

Upon examining the logic, the program checks if the sum of a shovel at index `i` and the shovel at index `n - i` ends with a certain number of nines using the following condition:
```python
if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
```
However, this condition is not correctly designed to count the number of nines at the end of the total cost. 

For example, if `n = 50`, the pairs should be (49, 50), which sums to 99, which indeed has two nines at the end. However, the current implementation would not correctly identify all valid pairs and may miss valid cases or count invalid ones.

A specific case that illustrates the program's failure is:
- For `n = 10`, the pairs (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), and (5, 5) all yield sums that do not end in nines, yet the expected output based on the problem description should be 0 pairs.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect conclusion.
