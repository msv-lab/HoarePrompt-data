To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze it based on the problem description and the requirements for replacing the question marks in the genome string.

### Problem Analysis:
1. The length of the genome `n` must be divisible by 4. If not, it is impossible to achieve an equal number of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and the output should be "===".
2. If the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' exceed `n / 4`, the output should also be "===".
3. The program should replace any '?' in the string with the appropriate nucleotide such that at the end, the number of each nucleotide is equal.

### Code Analysis:
- The function `func_1()` reads input data, parses `n` and `s`, and performs initial checks related to `n` (check for divisibility by 4).
- It counts the occurrences of nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
- If any nucleotide count exceeds the target (which is `n / 4`), it prints "===".
- It then replaces '?' with nucleotides based on the counts until all '?' are replaced or all nucleotides reach the target count.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. When `n` is 4 and `s` contains all '?': The output should be "ACGT".
2. When `n` is 8 and `s` is "??A?C??T": The program should be able to replace the '?' correctly to still meet the criteria.
3. When `n` is 4 and `s` is "AA??": The output should be "===" since there are already too many 'A's.
4. When `n` is 8 and `s` contains more than two of any nucleotide and multiple '?': The program should handle the excess correctly.

### Testing the Program:
1. **Input:** 
   ```
   4
   AAAA
   ```
   **Expected Output:** "===" (because there are too many 'A's)
   
2. **Input:** 
   ```
   4
   A?C?
   ```
   **Expected Output:** "ACGT" (valid replacements)

3. **Input:** 
   ```
   8
   ACGT????
   ```
   **Expected Output:** "ACGTACGT" (valid replacements)

4. **Input:** 
   ```
   8
   ??G??CCT
   ```
   **Expected Output:** "ACGTACCT" (valid replacements)

5. **Input:**
   ```
   8
   ??G??CCG
   ```
   **Expected Output**: "===" (more than allowed nucleotides, specifically 'C')

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it has the logic to handle the replacements correctly and check for invalid input conditions. However, it does not handle the case where it doesn't reach a valid output due to the presence of excess nucleotides properly. 

**Thus, there exists cases where the program may not return the expected output based on the conditions described. For example, if there are already too many of any nucleotide present in the input string, it should output "===" instead of attempting to replace '?' with those nucleotides.**

Correctness: **False**
