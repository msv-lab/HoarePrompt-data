Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the maximum possible value of the mex of the array after applying the allowed operations. 

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding mex**: The mex (minimum excluded value) of an array is the smallest positive integer that is not present in that array. 

2. **Sorting**: The program starts by sorting the input array. Sorting allows us to efficiently determine the smallest missing integer by iterating through the sorted values.

3. **Iterating through the array**: 
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to 1 since the smallest positive integer starts from 1.
   - The program then iterates through each number in the sorted array. If the current number is greater than or equal to `mex`, it means we can account for `mex` and increment it, as we can adjust the numbers to fill in that gap.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `mex`, which represents the maximum possible mex of the transformed array.

### Edge Cases:
- When `n = 1`, the program correctly handles the single element case.
- When all elements are equal, the program correctly computes the necessary adjustments to achieve the maximum mex.
- Large values are also handled due to the constraints of the problem.

The logic follows all required operations as described in the problem statement, and the output provided by the program matches expected results for given examples and any potential edge cases that can be envisioned. Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
