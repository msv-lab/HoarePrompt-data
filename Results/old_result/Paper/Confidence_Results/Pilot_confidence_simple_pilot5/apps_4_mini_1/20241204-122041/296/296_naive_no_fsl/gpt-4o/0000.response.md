Correctness: **False**

The program has a flaw in its logic. It checks for divisors of the integer \( n \) that satisfy the condition \( 1 < b_i < n \), but does not ensure that the sum of the fractions \( \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

For example, if \( n = 4 \), the divisors found would be \( 2 \) (since \( 1 < 2 < 4 \)). The program would generate the fraction \( \frac{1}{2} \). However, the required sum \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) cannot be achieved with just \( \frac{1}{2} \). The program would incorrectly return 'YES' with only one fraction, failing to meet the total sum requirement.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
