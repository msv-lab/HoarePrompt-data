Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the minimization of the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready. The approach used in the `func_3()` function iterates through integer coordinates for the heat source (from -1000 to 1000 for both x and y), which is not sufficient to find the optimal point since the heat source can be placed at any real number coordinates.

This means that the solution is only checking a limited number of points and might miss the optimal location, which could very well be between two integers. For example, if the optimal coordinates for minimizing time were at (0.5, 0.5) but the program only checks integer coordinates, it would not find this optimal point.

Therefore, since it does not cover all possible placements of the heat source, there exists cases where the program will not produce the correct minimal grilling time. 

For example, consider the inputs:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```
The optimal point is indeed (approximately -0.2, 0) which the program may be able to find, but if the meat positions were such that the optimal point was (0.5, 0.5), it would not be able to find it as it only considers integer values. Thus, the code is incomplete and potentially incorrect for many configurations of meat positions.

Hence, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described for every potential case.
