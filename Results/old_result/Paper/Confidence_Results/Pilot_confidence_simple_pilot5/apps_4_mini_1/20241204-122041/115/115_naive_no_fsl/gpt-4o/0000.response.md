Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where it is impossible to form the matrix \( A \) from matrix \( B \) correctly. Specifically, the program only considers forming the submatrices of \( 1s \) in \( A \) but does not check for cases where isolated \( 1s \) exist in \( A \) that cannot be covered by a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

In this matrix \( A \), there are isolated \( 1s \) at positions (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3). The program would not be able to form \( B \) to match \( A \) since there are no valid \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices that can cover these isolated \( 1s \).

The program would output `-1`, which is correct in this context, but it does not consider that the isolated \( 1s \) make it impossible to transform \( B \) into \( A \) using the allowed operations.

Thus, the program can incorrectly assess the situation in certain configurations of \( A \), leading to incorrect results.
