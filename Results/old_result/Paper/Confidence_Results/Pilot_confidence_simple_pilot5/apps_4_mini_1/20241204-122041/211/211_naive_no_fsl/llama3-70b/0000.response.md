Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 -1 0
```
The expected output should be:
```
NO
```
since it is impossible to split the array into parts where each part has a non-zero sum. However, the given program will incorrectly output:
```
YES
1
1 3
```
This output suggests that the entire array is one part, but the sum of the entire array is zero, violating the requirement that each new array must have a non-zero sum.

Additionally, the program has a logic flaw in how it determines when to print each subarray. It checks the prefix sums but does not correctly ensure that the individual segments meet the non-zero sum requirement consistently throughout the entire array.

Thus, the program fails to handle this case and potentially others, leading to its incorrectness.
