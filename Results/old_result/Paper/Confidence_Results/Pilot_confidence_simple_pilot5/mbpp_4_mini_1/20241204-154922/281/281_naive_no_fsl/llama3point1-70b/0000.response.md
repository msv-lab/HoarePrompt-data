Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find even numbers from a list of numbers. 

The code uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `numbers`, and it checks if each number is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. If the condition is true, the number is included in the resulting list. 

This approach handles all potential cases, including:
- An empty list, which will return an empty list.
- A list with all even numbers, which will return the same list.
- A list with all odd numbers, which will return an empty list.
- A mix of even and odd numbers, which will return a list containing only the even numbers.
- Negative even numbers and zero, which are also correctly identified as even.

Since no edge cases or examples can be found where the program does not perform as expected, the implementation is deemed correct.
