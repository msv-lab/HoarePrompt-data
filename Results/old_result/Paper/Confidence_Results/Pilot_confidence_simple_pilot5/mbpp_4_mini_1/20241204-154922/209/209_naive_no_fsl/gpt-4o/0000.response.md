Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when sublists are empty. For example, if `func_1` is called with an input like `func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4]])`, it will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access `sublist[0]` for the first empty sublist. This situation demonstrates that the function does not work as expected for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
