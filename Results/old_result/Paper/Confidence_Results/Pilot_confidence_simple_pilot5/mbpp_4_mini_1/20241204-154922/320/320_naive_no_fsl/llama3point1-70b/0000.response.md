To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we'll analyze the function `func_1(nums)`.

Here's the breakdown of the function:

1. **Unique Numbers**: The function first converts the input list `nums` into a set to remove duplicates, then converts it back to a list called `unique_nums`.
2. **Check Length**: It checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `None`, indicating that there isn't a second smallest number.
3. **Sorting**: If there are at least two unique numbers, it sorts `unique_nums` and returns the second element (the second smallest number).

### Edge Cases and Analysis
- **Case with less than 2 unique numbers**: If the input is a list with all identical elements (e.g., `[5, 5, 5]`), it correctly returns `None`. This aligns with the requirement that a second smallest does not exist.
- **Case with exactly 2 unique numbers**: For input like `[3, 1, 2, 2]`, the unique set would be `{1, 2, 3}`, and sorting would yield `[1, 2, 3]`, returning `2`, which is correct.
- **Case with more than 2 unique numbers**: The function will sort the unique numbers correctly and return the second smallest as expected.
- **Case with negative numbers or zero**: The function handles negative numbers and zero properly as it does not impose any restrictions on the range of numbers.

### Potential Problematic Case
However, one potential case that the function does not handle correctly is the situation where the input list contains only one unique number. The requirement is to return the second smallest number, but the function returns `None`, which, while logically correct, technically does not fulfill the requirement of returning the second smallest number. 

For instance:
- Input: `[4, 4, 4]` â†’ Expected behavior: should indicate that there is no second smallest number, which it does by returning `None`. This situation might be interpreted differently depending on how strictly one interprets "finding" the second smallest.

### Conclusion
The function fails to properly provide a second smallest number when it is not present, as it returns `None` instead of communicating that no valid second smallest exists. 

Thus, the function does not meet the problem description's requirements in an absolute sense.

Correctness: **False**
