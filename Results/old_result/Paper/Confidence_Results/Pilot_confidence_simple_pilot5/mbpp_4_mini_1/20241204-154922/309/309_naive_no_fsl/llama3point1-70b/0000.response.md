Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set, which inherently removes duplicate characters. If the length of this set is 1, it means that all characters in the string were the same, hence it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function will work correctly for the following cases:
1. For an empty string `""`, it returns `True` because there are no differing characters.
2. For a string with identical characters, such as `"aaaa"`, it returns `True`.
3. For a string with different characters, such as `"abc"`, it returns `False`.
4. For a string with mixed cases, such as `"AaA"`, it returns `False` since 'A' and 'a' are considered different characters.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that the function does not handle correctly according to the problem description. Hence, it meets the requirements as stated.

In summary, since the function handles all possible cases according to the problem description, the correctness is confirmed as **True**.
