Correctness: **True**

The provided program checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The logic used in the function is correct: it returns `True` if the number is odd (i.e., if `n % 2` is not equal to 0) and `False` if the number is even.

To verify the correctness, consider the following cases:
1. For an odd number, such as `3`, the function will return `True` because `3 % 2` equals `1` (not equal to `0`).
2. For an even number, such as `4`, the function will return `False` because `4 % 2` equals `0`.
3. For negative odd numbers, such as `-5`, the function will also return `True` because `-5 % 2` equals `-1` (not equal to `0`).
4. For negative even numbers, such as `-2`, the function will return `False` because `-2 % 2` equals `0`.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and meets the problem description requirements, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
