Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(lst, tpl)` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and concatenates them, returning a new list that includes all elements from both the original list and the tuple. 

The assertions provided in the code confirm this behavior for specific cases:

1. `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`
2. `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`
3. `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`

The function handles the conversion of the tuple to a list correctly, and there are no edge cases that would lead to incorrect behavior for the expected inputs. Therefore, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description.
