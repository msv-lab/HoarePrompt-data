Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, it has a flaw in the handling of edge cases, specifically when the input array contains fewer than two elements.

For example, if we provide an input like `arr = [5]` or `arr = []`, the current implementation will return `float('inf')` because there are not enough elements to compute a difference. This behavior does not meet the problem description's requirement to find the minimum difference between any two elements.

Thus, since the program does not handle the case where the array has fewer than two elements, it cannot be considered correct.
