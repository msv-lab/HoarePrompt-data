To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, I will analyze the function `func_1` alongside the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]

# Test Cases
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Finding Indices**: The function correctly finds the first and last occurrences of the character `ch` using `find` and `rfind`.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The condition `if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:` is meant to handle cases where:
   - The character does not exist in the string (both first and last indices will be -1).
   - The character only occurs once in the string (first and last indices will be the same).
3. **Return Value**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the function constructs a new string that omits the first and last occurrences of the character.

### Potential Cases Not Handled:
- **Case with Multiple Consecutive Characters**: For example, if the input is `func_1('aaa', 'a')`, the function is expected to return an empty string `''`, as both the first and last `a` should be removed. However, currently, it would return `'a'` because the first and last indices are the same, and thus it hits the return with the original string.

### Verdict:
Since the function does not handle the case of multiple identical characters properly and does not return the expected result in that scenario, we can conclude that the implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The function fails to remove the first and last occurrences of the specified character in cases where it appears multiple times consecutively. For example, `func_1('aaa', 'a')` should return `''`, but it currently would return `'a'`.
