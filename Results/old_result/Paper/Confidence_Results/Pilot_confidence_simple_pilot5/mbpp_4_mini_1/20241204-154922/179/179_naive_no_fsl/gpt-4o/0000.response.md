To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the implementation of the function.

**Problem description:** The task is to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

**Understanding the program:**
1. The function `func_1(n)` generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This generates even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., up to `2*n`.
2. The function then calculates the cube sum of these even numbers using a generator expression in the `sum()` function: `cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`.
3. The function returns the total `cube_sum`.

**Verification of the provided assertions:**
- For `n = 2`, the first 2 even numbers are 2 and 4. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\) and \(4^3 = 64\). The sum is \(8 + 64 = 72\). The assertion is correct.
- For `n = 3`, the first 3 even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\), \(4^3 = 64\), and \(6^3 = 216\). The sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 = 288\). The assertion is correct.
- For `n = 4`, the first 4 even numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\), \(4^3 = 64\), \(6^3 = 216\), and \(8^3 = 512\). The sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\). The assertion is correct.

**Testing edge cases:**
- If `n = 0`, we need to consider what should happen. The first 0 even natural numbers would result in a cube sum of 0. The function currently doesn't handle `n = 0`, and it would return 0, which is arguably correct for that edge case.
- If `n = 1`, the first even number is 2, and the cube sum would be \(2^3 = 8\), which is correctly handled by the function.

Since we have tested various cases, including edge cases, and no potential cases where the program fails to meet the description arise, the program appears to function correctly in all tested scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
