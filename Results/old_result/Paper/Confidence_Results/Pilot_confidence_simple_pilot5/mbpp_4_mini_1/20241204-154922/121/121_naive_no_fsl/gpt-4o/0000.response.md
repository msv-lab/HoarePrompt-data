To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem description and the implementation.

### Problem Description
The task is to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers derived from a recurrence relation. The first few Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are known to be: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73.

### Program Analysis
The provided implementation consists of an assertion check for specific values and a function `func_1(n)` that computes a sequence based on a recurrence relation. 

1. The function handles cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1`, returning `1` for both.
2. For any other value of `n`, it seems to be generating values in a manner analogous to the Fibonacci sequence but specifically using `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Return Values**: The return values for `n == 0` and `n == 1` are `1`, which are not prime numbers. The first prime is `2` and the second is `3`. The sequence should start from the first Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.
  
2. **Missing Logic**: The function does not appear to handle cases correctly for `n` values greater than `4`, as it generates a sequence that is not aligned with the known Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions given (3, 4, and 5) relate to the prime numbers, but the calculations in `func_1` do not align with the generation of those primes. The actual generation of primes should be based on a method that recognizes and returns only prime numbers from the sequence defined by the Newman–Shanks–Williams relation.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly compute or return the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, especially for the base cases and higher values. 

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to represent the correct sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes and returns incorrect values for the specified cases.
