Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, it does not correctly implement the logic to identify these specific primes. The first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are 7, 11, 17, 23, 29, and 41. 

The logic in `func_2` checks if a number is prime and if it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, which is not sufficient to determine whether a number is a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. For example, the number 11 is indeed a prime and satisfies the condition `11 % 6 in [1, 5]`, but the program may miss this number if it increments inappropriately or if it doesn't maintain the correct count of the Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

Additionally, the prime-checking logic in `func_1` is correct, but the filtering for Newman-Shanks-Williams primes is incomplete. This can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program fails to correctly identify all Newman-Shanks-Williams primes based on the definition, which includes specific conditions that are not fully implemented.

For example, if `n=2`, the program should return 11, but it may not do so because it doesn't correctly track which primes are classified as Newman-Shanks-Williams. Hence, the program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description.
