To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, I will analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

### Understanding Binomial Coefficients:
Binomial coefficients are defined as `C(n, k)` where `n` is the total number of items, and `k` is the number of items to choose. The even index binomial coefficients would refer to the coefficients where `k` is even.

For any given `n`, the binomial coefficients can be found as follows:
- `C(n, 0), C(n, 2), C(n, 4), ...` up to the largest even integer less than or equal to `n`.

The sum of the even index binomial coefficients can be computed mathematically as:
- **Sum of even indexed coefficients** = \( \frac{1}{2} \left( 2^n + C(n, 0) \right) \)

The above sum can be simplified to \( 2^{n-1} \) for `n > 0` because `C(n, 0)` is always `1`.

### Analyzing the Provided Code:
```python
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

The function `func_1(n)` returns \( 2^{n-1} \). 

#### Checking the Assertions:
1. For `n = 4`: 
   - Expected: \( 2^{4-1} = 2^3 = 8 \) (Correct)
   
2. For `n = 6`: 
   - Expected: \( 2^{6-1} = 2^5 = 32 \) (Correct)

3. For `n = 2`: 
   - Expected: \( 2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2 \) (Correct)

#### Validating Additional Cases:
- For `n = 1`:
   - Expected: \( 2^{1-1} = 2^0 = 1 \) (Should return 1, but it’s not tested in assertions)
   
- For `n = 3`:
   - Expected: \( 2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4 \) (Should return 4, but it’s not tested in assertions)

- For `n = 5`:
   - Expected: \( 2^{5-1} = 2^4 = 16 \) (Should return 16, but it’s not tested in assertions)

### Conclusion:
The function is returning \( 2^{n-1} \) which aligns with the expected result for all tested cases. 

However, the function does not have any logic to handle invalid inputs (like `n <= 0`) and does not check for inputs that are not positive integers, which could lead to incorrect behavior if such inputs are provided. 

For example:
- If `n = 0`, the function would return \( 2^{-1} = 0.5 \), which is not acceptable as `n` should be a positive integer.

Thus, since the function does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to handle the case when `n = 0` or when `n` is not a positive integer.
