To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the functionality of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to convert a snake case string (e.g., "this_is_snake_case") to a camel case string (e.g., "ThisIsSnakeCase").

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str
```

### Analysis:
1. The function splits the input string `snake_case_str` at underscores (`_`) using the `split` method, which correctly separates the words of the snake case string.
2. It then capitalizes each word using `capitalize()`, which converts the first character to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.
3. Finally, it concatenates these words together with `join()`.

### Potential Edge Case:
- If the input string is empty (`""`), the split operation will result in a list containing one empty string: `[""]`. The `capitalize()` method will return an empty string for this case, resulting in an output of `""`.

- If the input string has leading or trailing underscores (e.g., `"_this_is_snake_case_"`), the split operation will produce extra empty strings. For example:
  - Input: `"_example_case"`
    - After split: `["", "example", "case"]`
    - After capitalize: `["", "Example", "Case"]`
    - Final output: `"ExampleCase"` (which is incorrect as the output should not include extra capitalization for the empty string).

- Another case to consider is when there are multiple underscores together (e.g., `"this__is__snake__case"`). In this case, the split will produce:
  - Input: `"this__is__snake__case"`
    - After split: `["this", "", "is", "", "snake", "", "case"]`
    - After capitalize: `["This", "", "Is", "", "Snake", "", "Case"]`
    - Final output: `"ThisIsSnakeCase"` (again it incorrectly handles the empty strings).

### Conclusion:
Given these edge cases where the function does not handle empty strings correctly (from leading, trailing, or consecutive underscores), the function does not work as expected for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
