Correctness: **False**

The program only removes spaces (' ') from the input string, but it does not handle other types of whitespace characters, such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or multiple spaces. For example, if the input string is `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, the function will return `"HelloWorld\n"` instead of `"HelloWorld"`, which does not meet the requirement of removing all whitespaces. Therefore, the program is not correct as it fails for inputs with different types of whitespace.
