To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the description, I need to analyze both the problem statement and the implementation of the function `func_1`.

The problem description requires the function to extract element-wise tuples from two given tuples. The current implementation of `func_1` uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to combine corresponding elements of the two tuples. This means for each pair `(a, b)`, it computes `a & b`.

Let's evaluate the assertions given:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`
   - Element-wise operations:
     - `10 & 5 = 0`
     - `4 & 2 = 0`
     - `6 & 3 = 2`
     - `9 & 3 = 1`
   - Result: `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which matches the assertion.

2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`
   - Element-wise operations:
     - `1 & 5 = 1`
     - `2 & 6 = 2`
     - `3 & 7 = 3`
     - `4 & 8 = 0`
   - Result: `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which matches the assertion.

3. `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`
   - Element-wise operations:
     - `8 & 7 = 0`
     - `9 & 13 = 9`
     - `11 & 14 = 10`
     - `12 & 17 = 0`
   - Result: `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, but the assertion expects `(0, 9, 10, 0)` which also matches.

Now, we'll consider potential edge cases or scenarios where the function may not behave as expected:

1. What if one of the tuples is empty? For example:
   - `func_1((), (1, 2, 3))` should theoretically return `()`, but the function would simply return `()` since there are no elements to process.

2. What if the tuples have mismatched lengths? For example:
   - `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`. The current implementation using `zip` would truncate the longer tuple, resulting in `(1 & 3, 2 & 4)` which equals `(1, 0)`. This behavior is not explicitly described in the problem statement, which implies that both tuples should be of the same length for an element-wise operation.

Since the function does not handle cases where the tuples have different lengths or where one of the tuples might be empty according to the problem description, it is not correct in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
