Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. In such a situation, the line `result = product / len(numbers)` will attempt to divide by zero (`len(numbers)` would be 0), which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. 

Additionally, the program does not specify how to handle non-numeric inputs, which could also lead to erroneous behavior.

For example, the following cases would fail:
- If `numbers` is an empty list `()`, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- If `numbers` contains any non-numeric elements, such as `("a", "b", "c")`, it will raise a `TypeError` when trying to multiply.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
