Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to filter odd numbers, but it incorrectly returns odd numbers instead of filtering them out. The provided function `func_1` is supposed to meet the problem's requirement of filtering odd numbers from a list. However, the condition `num % 2 != 0` selects odd numbers rather than excluding them. 

For example:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Expected output (filtering odd numbers): `[2, 4]`
- Actual output from the program: `[1, 3, 5]` 

This demonstrates that the function does not fulfill the requirement stated in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is false.
