Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string. 

Examining the logic:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input `strings`.
2. For each string, it accesses the last character using `s[-1]`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the input tuple contains empty strings, the program would raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the last character of an empty string.
- If the input tuple itself is empty, the program would return an empty list, which is the expected behavior.

However, the critical issue is that if any string in the input tuple is empty, the program will fail. 

For example:
```python
func_1(("", "hello", "world"))  # This will raise an IndexError
```

Hence, the program does not handle the case of empty strings properly, leading to a runtime error.

Therefore, based on this analysis:

Correctness: **False**
