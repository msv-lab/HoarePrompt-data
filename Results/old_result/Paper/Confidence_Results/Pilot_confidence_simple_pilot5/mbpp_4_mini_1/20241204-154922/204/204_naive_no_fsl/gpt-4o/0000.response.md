Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input is not a valid month number, such as 0 or 13. According to the problem description, the function should only check for valid month numbers (1 to 12). If the function receives an invalid month number, it will incorrectly return `False` when it should ideally handle those inputs appropriately (e.g., by raising an error, returning `None`, or a specific message).

For example:
- `func_1(0)` does not produce an error but returns `False`, which is incorrect as 0 is not a valid month.
- `func_1(13)` also returns `False`, which is also incorrect.

This indicates that the program is not functioning correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is False.
