To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let’s analyze the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes in a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list for every `n`th element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Understanding the slicing**:
   - `lst[i::n]` creates a slice of the list starting at index `i` and takes every `n`th element.
   - The list comprehension iterates `i` from `0` to `n-1`, resulting in `n` different slices.

2. **Expected Output**:
   - For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n` is `2`, we expect:
     - `lst[0::2]` → `[1, 3, 5]`
     - `lst[1::2]` → `[2, 4, 6]`
   - Thus, the output should be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is greater than the length of the list, the function will still return `n` empty lists, which may not align with common expectations of splitting the list.
   - If `n` is `0`, it will raise an error since the step in slicing cannot be `0`.
   - If the list is empty, the function will return a list of `n` empty lists.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- For an empty list `[]` and `n = 3`: 
  - The function returns `[[], [], []]`, which is technically correct but may not be intuitive based on the problem description.
  
- For `n = 0`:
  - This will raise a `ValueError` since you cannot slice with a step of `0`.

### Conclusion:
While the program works correctly for many typical cases, it has issues with:
- Returning multiple empty lists when `n` is greater than the length of the list or when the list is empty. This may not meet the intent behind "splitting the list".
- Raising an error when `n` is `0`, which is not handled.

Thus, since the program does not behave correctly for all potential cases described in the problem, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The function does not handle the case where `n` is `0` and may not handle the expectations for cases with empty lists or `n` greater than the list length properly.
