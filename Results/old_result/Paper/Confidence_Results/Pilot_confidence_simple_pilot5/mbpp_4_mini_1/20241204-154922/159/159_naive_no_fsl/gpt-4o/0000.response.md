Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(radius, height)` is correctly implementing the formula for the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]

The program has test cases that check the function against known correct values for different radius and height pairs:

1. For a radius of 5 and height of 12, it accurately produces approximately 314.15926535897927.
2. For a radius of 10 and height of 15, it produces approximately 1570.7963267948965.
3. For a radius of 19 and height of 17, it produces approximately 6426.651371693521.

The code also correctly accounts for the mathematical constants and operations involved in calculating the volume of a cone. 

Furthermore, it handles typical input values (positive integers) which are valid for the geometric dimensions of a cone. 

Since there are no edge cases presented in the problem description that the function fails to handle, such as negative values or zero radius/height, and all tested cases yield the expected results, the program can be deemed correct.
