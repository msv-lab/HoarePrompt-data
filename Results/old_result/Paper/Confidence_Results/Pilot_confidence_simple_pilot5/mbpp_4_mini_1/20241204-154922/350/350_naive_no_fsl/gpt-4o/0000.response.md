Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. 

- The function iterates through the array in reverse order, which allows it to find the last occurrence of the element efficiently.
- If the element `x` is found, it returns the index immediately, ensuring that the last position is returned.
- If the element is not found after checking all indices, it correctly returns `-1`.

The provided assertions confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Additionally, it handles edge cases effectively, such as when the array is empty or when the element does not exist in the array. Since all potential cases I can think of where the function might fail have been accounted for, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
