Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the edge case when the input list is empty. According to the problem description, if all items in the list should match the given element, then in the case of an empty list, it should return `True` (since there are no items that contradict this condition). However, the current implementation will return `True` only if the list contains at least one element that matches `element`, and will return `True` at the end if all match. 

Here's what happens:
- If you call `func_1([], 'blue')`, the function will return `True`, as no elements are there to contradict.

Therefore, the program fails to account for the case when the list is empty, which contradicts the problem's requirements.
