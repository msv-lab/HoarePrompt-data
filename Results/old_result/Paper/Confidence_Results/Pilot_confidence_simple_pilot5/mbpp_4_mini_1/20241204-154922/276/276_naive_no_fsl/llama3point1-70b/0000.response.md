To determine the correctness of the provided program, we analyze the problem description and the implementation. 

The problem is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

The program merges the two lists into one sorted list and calculates the median based on the size provided. 

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Merging and Sorting**: The program combines `list1` and `list2` and sorts them. This is correct as it ensures the merged list is in order.
2. **Determining the Median**:
   - The code calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1`, which is incorrect. For finding the median, you should find the middle index based on the total count of elements, which is `2 * size - 1` for the merged list. 
   - If the size is even, the median is calculated using the two middle values, which is handled incorrectly since `middle_index` is off by one for the correct indices.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the two lists:
- `list1 = [1, 3]`
- `list2 = [2, 4]`
- `size = 2`

With these inputs, the merged list should be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. 
- The correct median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Using the provided code:
- The calculated `middle_index` would be `1` (since `size - 1 = 1`), and it would try to access `merged_list[1]` and `merged_list[2]`, leading to `(2 + 3) / 2` which is correct, but not defined correctly in terms of the logic for median calculation based on size.

For odd sizes, the logic would also be flawed due to incorrect index calculations.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly compute the median based on the size of the input lists due to incorrect indexing. 

Correctness: **False**.
