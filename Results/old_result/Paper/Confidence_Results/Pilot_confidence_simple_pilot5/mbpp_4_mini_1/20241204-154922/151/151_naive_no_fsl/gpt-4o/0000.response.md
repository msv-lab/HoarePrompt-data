Correctness: **False**

The provided program `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure. However, it lacks handling for certain edge cases. One notable case is when the input contains non-list elements (e.g., strings or dictionaries). For example:

```python
func_1([1, 2, [3, 'four'], 5]) 
```

In this case, the expected output should be `[1, 2, 3, 'four', 5]`, which the program would handle correctly. However, if we try:

```python
func_1([1, [2, [3, [4, 5]], 6], 7, {'a': 8}])
```

The expected output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, {'a': 8}]`, but the program will throw a type error when it tries to process the dictionary, as it only checks if an item is a list. 

Since the program does not handle input that includes non-list elements properly, it does not meet the problem requirements for all possible cases, thus making it incorrect.
