Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst)` checks whether every odd index in the input list `lst` contains odd numbers. The logic implemented in the function is as follows:

1. It iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and increments by 2 to check all odd indices.
2. For each odd index, it checks if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
3. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`.
4. If all odd indexed numbers are odd, it returns `True`.

The test cases provided cover multiple scenarios:
- In the first test case, the function correctly identifies that the odd indexed elements (1 and 3) are both odd, returning `True`.
- In the second test case, it checks the elements at odd indices (1) which is odd, returning `True`.
- In the third test case, the function finds an even number at the odd index (2), returning `False`.

Since I cannot find any edge cases or potential issues with the function, it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
