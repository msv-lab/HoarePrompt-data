To determine the correctness of the provided program, we first analyze the problem description and then examine the code implementation.

**Problem description:** The task is to check whether every odd index in the given list contains odd numbers.

**Program implementation:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis of the Program

1. The program iterates over each index `i` of the list `lst`.
2. It checks if the index `i` is odd (using `i % 2 != 0`).
3. If the index is odd and the value at that index `lst[i]` is even (using `lst[i] % 2 == 0`), it returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases

Let's consider potential edge cases to see if the program covers all scenarios as described:

- **Case with an empty list:** For `lst = []`, there are no indices, so it should return `True` as there are no odd indices to check.
- **Case with a list of odd length:** For `lst = [1, 2, 3]`, the odd index is `1`, and it contains `2`, which is even. The expected result is `False`.
- **Case with a list of even length:** For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, again the odd index is `1`, which contains `2`, leading to `False`.
- **Case with all odd numbers at odd indices:** For `lst = [1, 1, 1, 1]`, odd indices `1` and `3` contain `1`, which is odd, so the expected result is `True`.
- **Case with even numbers at all odd positions:** For `lst = [0, 2, 4, 6]`, odd indices `1` and `3` contain `2` and `6`, both of which are even; thus, it should return `False`.

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the program, I find that it correctly checks the condition described: it identifies whether every odd index contains odd numbers based on the criteria set forth in the problem description. 

I also considered potential edge cases, and the code handles them appropriately.

Thus, the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **True**
