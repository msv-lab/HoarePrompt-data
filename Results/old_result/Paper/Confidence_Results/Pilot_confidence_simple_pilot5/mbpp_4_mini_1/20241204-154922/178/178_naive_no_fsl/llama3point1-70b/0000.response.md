Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The program uses the `round()` function to round each number in the input list. This meets the requirement of rounding every number.

2. **Calculating Total Sum**: It then calculates the sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum()` function.

3. **Multiplying by Length**: Finally, the program multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list of numbers, which is the last requirement of the problem.

The program handles the following potential cases correctly:
- If the input list is empty, the length will be 0, and multiplying by 0 will correctly return 0.
- It correctly rounds both positive and negative numbers as well as floating-point numbers.
- It will handle large lists and negative lengths appropriately.

Since I could not identify any edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
