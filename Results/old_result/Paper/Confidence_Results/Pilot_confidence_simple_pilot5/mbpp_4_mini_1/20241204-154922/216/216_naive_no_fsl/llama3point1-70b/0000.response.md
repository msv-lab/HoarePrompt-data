To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the code implementation.

**Problem Description:** The task is to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

**How the Program Works:**
1. The list `lst` is sorted.
2. The program checks if every adjacent pair of numbers in the sorted list differs by exactly 1 using `all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))))`.
3. It also checks if there are any duplicate numbers in the list by comparing the length of the list with the length of the set created from the list (which removes duplicates).

**Potential Cases to Test:**
1. **Empty List:** `[]` - Should return `False` because there are no numbers.
2. **Single Element List:** `[5]` - Should return `False` because a single number cannot be considered consecutive.
3. **Consecutive Numbers:** `[3, 4, 5, 6]` - Should return `True`.
4. **Non-Consecutive Numbers:** `[1, 3, 2, 5]` - Should return `True` as they are consecutive when sorted.
5. **List with Duplicates:** `[1, 2, 2, 3]` - Should return `False` because of the duplicate.
6. **Negative and Positive Mix:** `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]` - Should return `True`.

**Issue Found:**
The program should return `False` for an empty list and a single element list based on the problem description, but the way the program is structured, it does not explicitly handle these edge cases correctly. The program will return `True` for an empty list since the `all()` function will return `True` for an empty iterator.

Thus, the function fails to correctly determine the status of lists that do not contain any numbers or contain only one number.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not handle empty lists and single-element lists correctly according to the problem description. For those cases, the expected output should be `False`, but it would incorrectly return `True`.
