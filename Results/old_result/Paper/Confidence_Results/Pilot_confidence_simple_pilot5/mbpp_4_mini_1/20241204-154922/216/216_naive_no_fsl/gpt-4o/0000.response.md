Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. Hereâ€™s why it works for all potential cases:

1. **Non-empty list with consecutive numbers**: The sorted version of the list will have adjacent elements differing by 1. For example, the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` will return `True`.

2. **Non-empty list without consecutive numbers**: The program returns `False` for inputs like `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`, where the numbers are not consecutive.

3. **Lists with duplicates**: The input `[1, 2, 1]` is handled correctly as it contains duplicates, and the sorted version would still show gaps in the consecutive sequence, returning `False`.

4. **Empty list**: The function returns `False` for an empty list, which aligns with the expectation that there are no consecutive numbers.

The implementation handles edge cases such as duplicates, empty lists, and varying sequences appropriately. Therefore, I found no potential cases where the code does not adhere to the problem description.
