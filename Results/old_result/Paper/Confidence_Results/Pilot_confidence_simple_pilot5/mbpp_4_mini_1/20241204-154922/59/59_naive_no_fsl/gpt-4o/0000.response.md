Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It works as follows:

1. It combines the three input lists into one using the `+` operator.
2. It then sorts the combined list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which sorts the elements in ascending order.
3. Finally, it returns the sorted list.

The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. 

Additionally, considering edge cases:
- It handles empty lists correctly, as combining an empty list with any other lists will still result in a sorted list. For example, `func_1([], [1, 2], [3])` would return `[1, 2, 3]`.
- It manages duplicate values appropriately, as shown in the test cases, ensuring they appear in the output.
- The function also correctly sorts negative numbers if they were part of the input lists.

Since I cannot find any potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program meets the requirements for all potential cases presented.
