Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The approach it uses is to concatenate the three lists using the `+` operator and then apply the `sorted()` function to the resulting list. 

The logic works as follows:
1. The three input lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) are combined into one list.
2. The `sorted()` function sorts this combined list in ascending order.

There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle, as it correctly processes empty lists, lists with negative or positive integers, and lists with duplicate values. 

For example:
- If all three lists are empty, the result is an empty list, which is sorted correctly.
- If one list is empty and the other two contain integers, the output will still be correctly sorted.
- If the lists contain varying data types (assuming they are all comparable), it will throw an error, but the problem description does not specify that this must be handled.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases that can be reasonably envisioned based on the information given.
