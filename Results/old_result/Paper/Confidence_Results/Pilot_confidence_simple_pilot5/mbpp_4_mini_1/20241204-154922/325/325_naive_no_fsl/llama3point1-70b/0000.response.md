Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle certain edge cases as outlined in the problem description. Specifically:

1. The function only checks if the month number is in the list of months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November).
2. It does not correctly address the requirement of checking for all months, including those with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and February, which has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it is a leap year.

For example, if the input is `2` (February), the function will return `False`, which is incorrect since February does not have 30 days. 

Thus, since the program does not correctly determine whether the given month number contains 30 days in every potential case, it is incorrect.
