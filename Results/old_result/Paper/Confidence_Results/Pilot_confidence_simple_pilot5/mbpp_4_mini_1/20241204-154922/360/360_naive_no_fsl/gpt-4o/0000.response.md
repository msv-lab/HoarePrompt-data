Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to return the list from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` iterates through each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`.
2. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of the elements.
3. It keeps track of the maximum sum encountered and the corresponding sublist that produced that sum.
4. After evaluating all sublists, it returns the sublist with the highest sum.

The assertions provided confirm that the function works for various cases:
- In the first case, it correctly identifies `[10, 11, 12]` as having the highest sum of 33.
- In the second case, it correctly identifies `[12, 11, 10]` with a sum of 33.
- In the third case, with only one sublist, it correctly returns that single sublist.

The function handles various scenarios, including:
- Multiple lists with the same maximum sum (it will return the first one in such cases).
- A single list.

Since no edge cases or potential failures were found, the program satisfactorily meets the problem description.
