Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two numbers as input parameters `a` and `b`, and it returns a tuple with the second number `b` as the first element and the first number `a` as the second element.

To verify the correctness, we can consider various input scenarios:

1. If we call `func_1(1, 2)`, the output will be `(2, 1)`, which is correct.
2. For `func_1(5, 10)`, the output is `(10, 5)`, which is also correct.
3. If we use negative numbers, e.g., `func_1(-1, -2)`, the output will be `(-2, -1)`, maintaining correctness.
4. For zero inputs, `func_1(0, 0)` will yield `(0, 0)`, which is correct according to the statement.

Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and adheres to the problem description, the program is correct in all potential cases.
