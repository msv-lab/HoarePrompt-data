Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function behaves as expected for various input cases. 

For example:
- `func_1(10, 20)` correctly returns `(20, 10)`.
- `func_1(15, 17)` correctly returns `(17, 15)`.
- `func_1(100, 200)` correctly returns `(200, 100)`.

Since the function consistently adheres to the stated requirements for all test cases, and I cannot identify any input that would cause it to fail, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
