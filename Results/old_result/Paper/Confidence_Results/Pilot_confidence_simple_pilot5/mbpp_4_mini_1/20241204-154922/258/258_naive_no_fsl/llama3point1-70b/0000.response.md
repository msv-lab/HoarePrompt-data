Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number. 

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function `func_1` follows these steps:

1. Converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. Determines the number of digits in the number.
3. Initializes a sum variable to zero.
4. Iterates through each digit, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and adds this value to the sum.
5. Finally, it checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number.

This implementation accounts for all potential cases, including single-digit Armstrong numbers (like 0 through 9), where each is trivially equal to itself when raised to the power of one. The code will also work for multi-digit numbers, handling any edge cases as it dynamically computes the length of the number.

No counterexamples can be identified where the code would fail to meet the Armstrong number criteria. Thus, the program is correct.
