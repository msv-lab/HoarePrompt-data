Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Conversion to String**: The number is converted to a string to facilitate easy access to each digit.
2. **Count Digits**: The length of the string representation (the number of digits) is calculated.
3. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits using a generator expression.
4. **Comparison**: Finally, it checks if the computed sum equals the original number.

The assertions provided are valid test cases:
- For `func_1(153)`, it returns `True` since \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 \).
- For `func_1(259)`, it correctly returns `False` since \( 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259 \).
- For `func_1(4458)`, it returns `False` since \( 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458 \).

These cases cover typical checks for Armstrong numbers. Additionally, edge cases such as single-digit numbers (all are Armstrong numbers) or zero would also pass with this logic.

Since no potential case can be found where the program does not function correctly according to the problem description, the implementation is deemed correct.
