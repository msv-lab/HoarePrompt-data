To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` in relation to the task of finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The function correctly calculates triangular numbers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

2. **Digit Count Check**: The function checks if the number of digits in the triangular number is equal to `n` using `len(str(triangular_number)) == n`.

3. **Return Value**: If the condition is met, the function returns the index `k`.

4. **Looping**: The function uses an infinite loop, which is acceptable since it will terminate when the correct condition is met.

### Edge Cases Consideration

- **Minimum Values**: The function will start calculating from `k = 1`. For `n = 1`, the smallest triangular number is `1`, and since its index `k` is `1`, the function should return `1`.
  
- **Higher Values**: For values of `n` greater than `1`, the program works as per the assertions provided: 
  - For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is `10` which corresponds to `k = 4` (triangular number is `10`).
  - For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is `105` which corresponds to `k = 14` (triangular number is `105`).
  - For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is `220` which corresponds to `k = 20` (triangular number is `210`).

### Testing the Function

Now, let's check if there is any case where the function might fail:

- For `n = 1`, the function should return `1`. However, there are no assertions provided for this case in the test. Therefore, we can test this value manually:

```python
print(func_1(1))  # Should return 1
```

- The function will indeed return `1`, which is correct.

### Conclusion

Since the function seems to handle the provided test cases and the edge cases appropriately, and there are no missing logical paths or incorrect outputs for any reasonable input, I conclude that the program correctly implements the task as described.

Correctness: **True** 

Explanation: The function correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits by correctly calculating triangular numbers and checking their digit counts. It passes the provided assertions and handles edge cases properly.
