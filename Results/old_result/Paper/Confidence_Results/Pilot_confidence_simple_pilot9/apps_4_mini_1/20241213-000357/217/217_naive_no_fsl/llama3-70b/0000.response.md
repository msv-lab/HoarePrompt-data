Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum possible value of \( B - C \). 

The issue arises from the way the program partitions the sorted list into sequences \( b \) and \( c \). The algorithm currently adds alternate elements to \( b \) and \( c \) based on the index, which does not guarantee the optimal partition. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 -1 1 -1
```
The correct approach would yield:
- If we pick \( b = {1, 1} \) and \( c = {-1, -1} \): 
  - \( B = 2 \)
  - \( C = -2 \)
  - Result: \( B - C = 4 \)

However, with the current implementation:
```
b = 1 (first element)
c = -1 (second element)
b = 1 (third element)
c = -2 (fourth element)
```
The output will yield \( B - C = 1 - (-1) = 2 - 0 = 2 \), which is not the maximum possible value.

Therefore, the output of the program does not align with the given problem description in every potential case.
