To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and analyze the implementation step by step.

### Problem Summary
1. We need to split an array into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero.
2. The output should include "YES" if the split is possible and additionally provide the indices for these subarrays.
3. If it is not possible to achieve such a split, we should output "NO".

### Program Analysis
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Code Breakdown
1. **Line 1-3**: Inputs the size of the array and the array itself.
2. **Line 4**: Computes the total sum of the array.
3. **Line 5-7**: If the total sum is not zero, it outputs "YES", indicating that the entire array can be one subarray.
4. **Line 8-14**: If the total sum is zero, it looks for any non-zero element. If found, it splits the array into two subarrays where one includes the non-zero part, and the other includes the rest.
5. **Line 11**: If A[i] is not zero, it prints the valid split and exits the loop.
6. **Line 13**: If no non-zero element is found, it outputs "NO".

### Edge Cases
Now, let's examine edge cases not covered:
- If the input array consists entirely of zeros, the program will output "NO" as expected.
- If the input array consists of exactly two non-zero elements with one being the negative of the other (for example, `1, -1`), the total sum will be zero. The program won't split the array correctly since both elements canâ€™t be treated as valid non-zero subarrays.
- The program does not handle cases correctly when all elements of the array are zero or when only one element is present which is zero.
- It does not explicitly ensure that if the total sum is zero, it finds valid splits.

### Counterexample
1. Input: `2`  
   Array: `1 -1`
   - Expected output: `NO` (since every partition would sum to zero).
   - Actual output with this program would incorrectly output `YES`, `2`, `1 1`, `2 2`.

### Conclusion
The program has logic flaws and does not adequately handle cases where the total sum is zero but contains elements that lead to zero-sum partitions. Based on the logical flaws present in the handling of edge cases and the potential for incorrect outputs, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
