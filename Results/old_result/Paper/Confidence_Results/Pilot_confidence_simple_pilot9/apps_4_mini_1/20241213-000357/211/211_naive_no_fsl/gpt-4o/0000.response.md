Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to handle certain edge cases appropriately in accordance with the problem description.

For instance, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
0 0 0
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the program will produce the output:
```
NO
```

which is correct in this case. But now consider another test case:

Input:
```
5
1 1 1 -3 0
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
2
1 3
4 5
```

However, the program outputs:
```
YES
1
1 5
```

This is incorrect as the output should provide the two partitions where each subarray should have a non-zero sum.

Therefore, the program does not cover all potential edge cases and provides incorrect outputs in some scenarios. Thus, it is not correct to say that the program meets the problem description's requirements for every case.
