To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic behind the program step-by-step:

### Problem Analysis
1. There are three types of voters: 
   - Upvoters (`x`)
   - Downvoters (`y`)
   - Unknown voters (`z`)

2. The result can be:
   - `"+"` if upvotes are definitively greater than downvotes.
   - `"-"` if downvotes are definitively greater than upvotes.
   - `"0"` if upvotes equal downvotes and there are no unknown voters to change the outcome.
   - `"?"` if there is ambiguity due to unknown voters (`z`).

### Cases to Check:
1. If `x > y + z`, this means that even if all unknowns downvote, `x` is still larger. The output should be `"+"`.
2. If `x < y`, it guarantees that downvotes are higher and the output should be `"-"`.
3. If `x == y`, we check:
   - If `z == 0`, the result is `"0"` because there is no ambiguity.
   - If `z > 0`, the result is uncertain and should be `"?"`.
4. If `y` is higher than `x`, then the output should also evaluate the role of `z`.

### Examining the Program:
The logic in the provided function seems to cover the necessary conditions, but let's break down its implementation in detail:

```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')
```

### Potential Problematic Cases:
1. If `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 5`, the expected output should be `"?"` since both upvotes and downvotes are equal and there is uncertainty due to the unknown voters. 
   - According to the function, this would print `"?"`. This is correct.

2. If `x = 5`, `y = 5`, and `z = 0`, the output expected is `"0"` because there are equal votes, and there are no unknown voters. 
   - According to the function, this correctly prints `"0"`.

3. If `x = 3`, `y = 5`, and `z = 0`, the expected output should be `"-"` because downvotes exceed upvotes and there are no unknowns. 
   - The function will print `"-"` correctly.

4. If `x = 2`, `y = 3`, and `z = 1`, the output should still be `"-"` since downvotes still outnumber upvotes, despite one unknown. 
   - The function prints `"-"` correctly.

5. If `x = 10`, `y = 2`, and `z = 0`, the output should be `"+"` because upvotes are much higher than downvotes. 
   - The function prints `"+"` correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program covers all edge cases described in the problem statement. It provides the correct output for all potential scenarios regarding the interplay between upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes.

Thus, there are no scenarios where the function would output incorrectly given the rules laid out in the prompt.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly implements the logic to determine the possible outcomes based on the input parameters.
