To assess the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to evaluate if the program correctly identifies the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all the skewers based on the specified rules.

The function `func_1(n, k)` implements the logic to determine which skewers to turn by using the formula `i += 2 * k + 1`, which attempts to calculate the next skewer to turn after covering `k` skewers on either side. The issue arises from the fact that the program might not adequately handle edge cases, particularly when `k` is greater than or equal to `n/2` or when `n` is small.

Consider the special case where `n = 1` and `k = 0`:
- Expected behavior: Turning skewer 1 would suffice because there are no adjacent skewers to consider.
- The program outputs `1` for both the minimum actions and the skewer turned, which is correct.

Now, let’s analyze when `n = 6` and `k = 3`:
- The expected result is that a single turn of skewer 3 would cover all skewers since it would affect skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- However, by the logic in the function, it turns `1` and `5`, which does not cover skewers `2`, `3`, `4`, as asserted by the problem statement.

To illustrate - if `n = 6` and `k = 3`:
- The turning operations would suggest just turning skewer 4, which would not happen under the current implementation as it jumps by `2k + 1`.

Thus, the given program does not generate the correct outputs for certain inputs, particularly when skewers are grouped in a way that can allow fewer turnings than obtained from the current algorithm.

Therefore, the program exhibits an inconsistency when checking all operational paths, violating the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly account for scenarios where turning one specific skewer would turn others—this shows that the approach is flawed on handling edge cases of `k` against `n`.
