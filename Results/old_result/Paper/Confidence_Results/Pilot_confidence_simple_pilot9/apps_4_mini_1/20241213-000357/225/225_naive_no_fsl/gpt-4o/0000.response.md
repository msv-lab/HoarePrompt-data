Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when there are no vowels in the input string at all. In such a scenario, the Grasshopper would be unable to complete his objective of jumping only on vowels. For example, if the input string is `BCDFGH`, the expected output should indicate that it is impossible to reach the end (there are no vowels to jump on). However, the existing implementation will output `6`, which is derived from the total length of the string instead of recognizing that there are no reachable points (vowels).

This means that the logic fails to consider edge cases where no vowels exist in the string, directly violating the problem's requirements.
