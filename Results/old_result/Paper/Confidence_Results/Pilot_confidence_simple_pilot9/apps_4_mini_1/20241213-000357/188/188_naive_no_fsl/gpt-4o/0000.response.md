Correctness: **False**

The provided program logic does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. 

### Reasoning for Incorrectness:
1. **Case with More Than Two Distinct Cards**: 
   - The program expects exactly two distinct numbers with each occurring n/2 times for the game to be fair. However, there are cases when there are multiple distinct numbers not evenly distributed but still can lead to a fair game. For instance:
     - If the input is:
       ```
       6
       1
       1
       2
       2
       3
       3
       ```
       The program outputs "NO", but it is still possible to generate a fair game if Petya chooses 1 and Vasya chooses 2 or 1 and 3.
   
2. **Even Distribution Check**: 
   - The program only checks for two specific numbers being present (`count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2` and `count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2`). This overlooks situations where a different combination could yield an equal fair distribution, such as:
     - If the input is:
       ```
       4
       1
       1
       2
       2
       ```
       The output should be "YES" with integers 1 and 2 because they each would take two cards.

Thus, the program does not account for all valid scenarios outlined in the problem description and fails for certain valid input cases, leading to an overall incorrect implementation.
