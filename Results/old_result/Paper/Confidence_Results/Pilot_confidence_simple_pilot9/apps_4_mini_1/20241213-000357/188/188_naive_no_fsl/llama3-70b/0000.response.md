Correctness: **False**

The program has a few logic issues that prevent it from fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. 

1. **Counting of Card Occurrences**: The program captures the frequency of each number on the cards but only checks for two numbers that both occur exactly `n // 2` times. However, this does not account for cases where there are multiple distinct integers where one integer occurs `k` times (where k can vary) and another distinct integer occurs `(n - k)` times, as long as both are different and sum up to `n`.

2. **Example that Fails**:
   - Consider the input:
   ```
   4
   1
   1
   2
   2
   ```
   - Here, Petya can choose `1` (takes two cards) and Vasya can choose `2` (also takes two cards). Thus the game is fair, and the output should be:
   ```
   YES
   1 2
   ```
   - The current program would output `NO` since it looks for exactly two numbers that occur `n // 2` times each, thus failing to recognize valid distributions that lead to a fair game.

3. **Additional considerations**: The program lacks checks for other combinations and distributions of card values. For example, it should be able to yield valid pairs from combinations where sums equal to `n`, but the distribution of occurrences varies.

Overall, because there are distinct cases where the program does not achieve correctness according to the problem statement, the conclusion is that it is incorrect.
