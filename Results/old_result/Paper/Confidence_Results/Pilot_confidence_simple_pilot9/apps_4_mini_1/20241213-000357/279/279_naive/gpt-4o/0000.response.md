To verify the correctness of the provided code against the given problem description, we can analyze the logic in the provided Python program.

1. The function `func_1` reads the input data, which includes the number of skewers `n`, a permutation `p`, and a sequence `b` that dictates the reversal behavior of each skewer.
2. The program then identifies cycles in the permutation `p`. Each cycle indicates how skewers are mapped to each other during their movement.
3. For each cycle, the program checks if all elements in the cycle are part of `b` that are zeros (indicating no reversals). The variable `no_reverse_components` counts how many such cycles exist.
4. Depending on the number of cycles, it prints either `0` (if there's only one cycle) or the number of cycles that have no reversals in `b`. It defaults to printing `1` if no cycles have reversals.

Let's analyze the correctness based on several input examples:

- For the input:
  ```
  4
  4 3 2 1
  0 1 1 1
  ```
  The cycles would be `(1)`, `(2)`, `(3)`, `(4)` where each skewer can move to exactly one other skewer. The result should reflect the two zero reversals in the cycles, which seems correct with the output as `2`.

- For the input:
  ```
  3
  2 3 1
  0 0 0
  ```
  The cycles are once again `(1, 2, 3)`. Since all values in `b` are zeros, we have one cycle without any reversals, so the program correctly outputs `1`.

However, there is a crucial issue we need to consider regarding the logic of the output based on cycle counts:

- The program does not handle the scenario correctly when there are multiple cycles but all are reversed. It should also allow for changes to the permutation not just based on the count of cycles but also on their characteristics (e.g., needing a reversal).

Consequently, there exists the scenario where the functioning of changing elements of the permutation `p` and the sequence `b` based on the requirements of them visiting all 2n placements isn't adequately described or accounted for by the logic. 

Thus, we can conclude the program has flaws in handling certain configurations of cycles and reversals, thereby not satisfying the problem requirements correctly for various inputs. 

Therefore, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to produce a correct output in cases where multiple cycles exist even when all elements in `b` are zeros, and it doesn't properly account for the necessary permutation changes needed to meet the 2n conditions.
