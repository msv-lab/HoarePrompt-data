Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the number of trailing zeroes requested (m) is larger than the number of trailing zeroes that can be produced by any factorial. For example, if we input `m = 6`, the program will return that the factorial of no integers produces exactly 6 trailing zeroes. However, for `m = 5`, `5!`, `6!`, `7!`, `8!`, and `9!` all have exactly 5 trailing zeroes, and should return those numbers.

A specific case where the program fails is when `m` is set to `5` because the output should be `5` and `5 6 7 8 9`. However, the code currently outputs `0`, indicating that there are no integers `n` such that `n!` has exactly `5` trailing zeroes, which is incorrect. It seems that the logic in `func_2` is incorrectly identifying viable values for `n`. 

Therefore, since the program fails on this case, it does not meet the correctness criteria stated in the problem description.
