Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the requirement that the grasshopper must only jump to empty cells ('.') and not land on obstacles ('#'). 

For example, consider the following input case:

```
5 2
G###T
```

In this case, the grasshopper (`G`) starts at index 0, and the insect (`T`) is at index 4. The grasshopper can jump in steps of 2. Although the absolute difference between `G` and `T` modulo `k` is zero (i.e., `abs(4 - 0) % 2 == 0`), there are obstacles (`#`) located at indices 1, 2, and 3. Hence, the grasshopper cannot reach the insect, as there are no valid landing positions.

However, the output of the program for this input would incorrectly be "YES," as the `all(...)` condition would erroneously evaluate that jumping to those indices is permissible. Thus, there is a clear example where the code fails to meet the problem's requirements. This indicates that the program is not correctly implemented to solve the problem for all potential edge cases.
