To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the relevant code segment:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Key Points in the Code:
1. The program reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of cells and `k` is the jump length.
2. It locates the positions of the grasshopper (`G`) and the insect (`T`) in the string `s`.
3. It checks if both `G` and `T` are found; if either is missing, it outputs "NO".
4. It then checks if the absolute distance between `G` and `T` is divisible by `k` and ensures that all cells that would be landed on during the jumps are not obstacles (`#`).

### Potential Issues:
To ensure correctness, let's check if there are any edge cases that may not be handled properly:

1. **Obstacles Scenario**: The program is supposed to check if the path is clear of obstacles. However, the current logic uses a modulo operation (`% n`) on the index calculation. This is unnecessary and incorrect in this context.
   - **Example Case**: For example, if `n=7`, `k=3`, and the string is `".G#T#..."`, the grasshopper is at index 1 and the insect at index 3. The jump calculation would be `g + i * k`, yielding indices that should never wrap around as per the problem statement, hence `g + 3` is index 4 which is an obstacle. 
   
   The calculation incorrectly allows for jumping over the length of the list due to the use of modulo.

2. **Final Check**: The loop checks for both the conditions, but misses checking the path correctly since the modulo wrap-around allows the grasshopper to jump into indexes that are either out of bounds or back into previously identified obstacles.

### Conclusion
Because of the mentioned issues, particularly the handling of obstacles via incorrect index calculations, the program does not correctly account for all potential cases for the grasshopper's path. 

Correctness: **False**. 

An example case that demonstrates this incorrectness: 
- Input: 
```
7 3
G#....T
```
- Expected output: "NO"
- Actual logic due to flawed indexing would allow checking wrapping indices making it flawed.
