To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we must consider the problem description and the expected behavior of the function. The program is supposed to calculate the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        n //= 10
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)
```

### Key Considerations:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from input, where `n` represents the number of shovels.
2. **Finding Maximum Nines**: The while loop checks how many times `(n + 1)` can be divided by 10 while maintaining its divisibility. The number of divisions determines `max_9s`, which signifies how many trailing nines the total cost can have.
3. **Calculating Pair Count**: It then calculates the number of pairs as `(n + 1) * max_9s`.

### Potential Issues:
1. The purpose of the counter `max_9s` is correct, but there could be a misunderstanding in how the calculation of pairs is being done. Specifically, multiplying `(n + 1)` with `max_9s` does not seem to accurately reflect the logic for finding pairs of shovels that meet the specified criteria.
  
### Test Cases:
1. For `n = 7`, following the logic:
   - `max_9s` becomes `1` since `8 % 10 == 0` (since 8 has 1 trailing 0).
   - Pairs calculated = `(7 + 1) * 1 = 8` instead of the expected output of `3`.
2. For `n = 14`:
   - `max_9s` becomes `1`.
   - Pairs calculated = `(14 + 1) * 1 = 15` instead of the expected output `9`.
3. For `n = 50`:
   - `max_9s` becomes `2`.
   - Pairs calculated = `(50 + 1) * 2 = 102` instead of the expected output `1`.

Given the expected outputs and the results produced by the code, we can clearly see discrepancies between the expected outcomes and what the program would produce.

### Conclusion:
Because we found multiple input values where the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
