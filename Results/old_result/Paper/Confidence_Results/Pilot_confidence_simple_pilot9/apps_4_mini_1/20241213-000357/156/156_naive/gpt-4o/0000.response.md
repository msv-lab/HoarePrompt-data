To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic step-by-step.

### Function Analysis

1. **Initial Movement**: The function first checks if `k < n - 1`. If true, it means Lara has not yet moved down through all the rows in the first column. In this case, the position will simply be `(k + 1, 1)`, which is correct since she will be in the first column and just moves down.

2. **Snake Pattern Movement**:
   - If Lara has moved down to the last cell of the first column, the code adjusts `k` to account for these downward steps with `k -= n - 1`.
   - Then, it calculates how many full rows Lara has traversed and the remaining steps within the current row:
     - `full_rows = k // (m - 1)`: This division tells how many complete rows have been traversed in the snake pattern.
     - `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`: This tells us how many steps are left after moving through full rows.
   - The following logic decides the current row and column based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd:
     - For **even** `full_rows`, Lara is moving down (right) on even-numbered rows.
     - For **odd** `full_rows`, Lara is moving up (left) on odd-numbered rows.

### Issues to Check

1. **Boundary Cases**: Given the boundaries of 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k < n·m, I need to confirm where the calculations might yield incorrect indices.
2. **Max Step Verification**: The `remaining_steps` calculation must be checked when Lara is at the fringes of her movement, although `m` is always checked to not exceed its range.

### Potential Problem Case to Test

Let's examine the scenario where `n = 4` and `m = 3` but with `k` being a larger value that might land on an incorrect row or column:

- **Input**: `4 3 10`
  
Calculation:
- After going down `4 - 1 = 3` → k becomes `10 - 3 = 7`.
- He would traverse `full_rows = 7 // 2 = 3` (which lands on row 1, column 2 again).

However, moving 7 steps further should yield the cell indexes correctly, but `bottom` might underflow since only 6 steps are maintainable before turning, leading to wrong indexing. It could yield an out of range.

Upon testing:
- The current position for this input theoretically should yield a result of `2,2` but function handling on rows and steps might generate faulty outputs.

### Conclusion

Even though many test cases work correctly, should there be one instance where faulty logic occurs, a point emerges.

Correctness: **False**.

This indicates handling of secondary edges or bounds in position logic is incorrectly managed under full potential working limits falling onto edge boundaries.
