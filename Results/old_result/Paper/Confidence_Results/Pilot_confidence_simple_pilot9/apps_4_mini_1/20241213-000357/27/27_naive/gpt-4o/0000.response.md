Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when two or more of the expressions evaluate to the same maximum value properly. According to the problem description, if multiple maximum values are present, the program must return the expression that comes first in the list of defined expressions. 

In the provided implementation, the `max` function will return the first maximum it encounters, which is correct. However, there is an oversight regarding its handling of how to correctly identify and output the expression. The pairing of maximum calculation and expression retrieval doesn't account for order if there's a tie at the maximum. The use of `max` does not guarantee the right index if more than one maximum is found. This could lead to a situation where expressions yield identical maximum values, and the wrong one could be reported if it's not the first in the order of interpretation.

For example, consider input values:
```
x = 2.0
y = 1.0
z = 3.0
```
Here, the calculations are as follows:
- `2.0^1.0^3.0 = 2.0^1.0^3.0`
- `2.0^3.0^1.0 = 8.0`
- `(2.0^1.0)^3.0 = 8.0`
- `(2.0^3.0)^1.0 = 8.0`
  
All of these yield the same maximum value corresponding to the expressions `(2.0^1.0)^3.0`, `2.0^3.0^1.0`, and `2.0^1.0^3.0` which equal `8.0`, but the program might not choose one of the expressions in the list correctly if specificity on ordering is not maintained through the maximum pairing retrieval. 

Thus, the program does not follow the requirement of returning the first maximum found, leading to potential incorrect outputs in cases of ties.
