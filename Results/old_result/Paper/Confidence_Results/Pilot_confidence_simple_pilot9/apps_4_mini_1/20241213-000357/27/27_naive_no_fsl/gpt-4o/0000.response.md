Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle the case when the input numbers yield an ambiguity in the maximum value calculation due to floating-point precision issues. In Python, floating-point arithmetic can be imprecise, leading to cases where two expressions evaluate to almost the same maximum value but differ slightly in actual numeric representation. 

For instance, consider inputs like:
```
100.0 100.0 100.0
```
In this scenario, all expressions evaluate to the same maximum value (1e+200). However, due to the order of expression evaluation and comparisons, the program does not guarantee which expression it will select and print due to potential issues in the way floating-point values are compared. 

The program's logic might lead to different outputs for inputs that theoretically should have the same maximum expression. Additionally, the program does not account for the requirement to print the first occurrence of the maximum value in a situation where multiple expressions yield the same numeric maximum. If they have the same value, the program should adhere to the order listed when returning the expression but the use of `max()` lacks this explicit ordering under certain numerical circumstances.

Thus, the failure to ensure consistency across potential edge cases reveals a flaw in its correctness.
