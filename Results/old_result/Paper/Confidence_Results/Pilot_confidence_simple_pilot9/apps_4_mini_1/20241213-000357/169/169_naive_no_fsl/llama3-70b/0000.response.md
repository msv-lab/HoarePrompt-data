Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the scenario where the number of take operations (`-`) exceeds the number of add operations (`+`). Specifically, while it considers that if `minus_count` exceeds `plus_count`, it should print `0`, it does not take into account that the number of initial stones must also allow for the operations to occur without resulting in a negative count of stones at any time.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
---
```
- Here, if Vasya can start with `3` stones, he can perform the operation `---` and end with `0` stones, which is accepted.
- However, consider the input:
```
4
----
```
- In this case, if he starts with `0` stones and tries to take `4` stones, he'll end up with a negative number of stones, which is not possible. The output should be a scenario where such total operations (`-`) are possible since he must have started with at least enough stones to allow this.

Therefore, the program incorrectly prints `0` when it should consider the requirement that the number of `-` operations should not exceed the total number of stones (including the initial stones). Thus, the solution is incomplete and fails for cases where the total number of `-` exceeds the additive modifications. 

Example case where it fails:
```
3
---
```
The correct logic requires maintaining a count of stones to avoid negative piles at any point during the operations that require taking more stones than the available stones.
