To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the code and see if it handles all potential cases appropriately.

The problem requires us to find a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The program attempts to do this by iterating over divisors of the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \).

Here's a breakdown of the function `func_3`:

1. If \( a \) is equal to \( b \), it correctly returns \( k = 0 \) because in this case, the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) is already minimized.
2. For the case where \( a \neq b \), the program calculates the absolute difference `diff` and iterates through the divisors of `diff`.
3. For each divisor \( k \), it adjusts \( a \) and \( b \) to the next multiples of \( k \) and calculates the LCM.
4. It keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding \( k \).

However, an issue arises in the code:

The program calculates \( new_a \) and \( new_b \) using:
```
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```
This computation is intended to find the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a` and `b`. However, when calculating `new_a` and `new_b`, if `a` or `b` is already a multiple of `candidate`, it incorrectly adjusts to the next multiple, leading to suboptimal values of \( k \).

**Counterexample**:
Let's consider the input \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 15 \). According to the problem, we need to find the smallest \( k \) to minimize the LCM of \( 10 + k \) and \( 15 + k \).

- If we check \( k = 0 \): LCM(10, 15) = 30.
- If we check \( k = 5 \): LCM(15, 20) = 60.
- If we check \( k = 10 \): LCM(20, 25) = 100.

The optimal choice is \( k = 0 \), which gives LCM = 30.

Following through the logic of the provided code with these values, the calculations for `new_a` and `new_b` might give incorrect outputs because they are forced to find the next multiples incorrectly. 

Thus, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios. 

Correctness: **False**.
