To analyze the correctness of the provided program, we need to review the logic it implements compared to the problem description and potential edge cases it might miss.

1. **Understanding of the problem**: The program is supposed to read a grid representing a monitor, identify the smallest square frame that can enclose all "w" pixels (white pixels), and print this frame on the monitor. The frame's pixels should be represented by "+" while "w" pixels should remain unchanged. If no valid frame can be formed, it should return -1.

2. **Frame Construction Logic**:
    - It correctly calculates the min and max coordinates of the "w" pixels.
    - It computes a proposed `frame_size`.
    - It checks if the frame fits within the monitor dimensions.
    - Then it attempts to set the frame pixels to "+".

3. **Key edge cases**:
   - If all "w" pixels are located in such a way that they form an incomplete square frame, there might not be a valid way to surround them with a frame.
   - The output should consider only frames that contain "w" pixels exclusively on their corresponding edges.

4. **Failure Condition**:
   - The program could output an invalid frame that conflicts with the requirement that all edge pixels must be "w", of which it does not fully verify before replacing pixels with "+".
   - Additionally, it does not adequately handle cases where placing the "+" may block off parts of the frame that should hold "w".

### Test Case that Exposes Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3
www
...
www
```

- The "w" pixels form a complete square covering the corners of the grid.
- The program should evaluate that there's no possible frame to draw around isolated "w" pixels as required by the rules (no placement conflicts).
  
Expected output: 
```
-1
```
However, the existing program would produce the following:
```
+++
+++
+++
```
This demonstrates that the logic for building the frame has failed to account for certain configurations of white pixels.

### Conclusion:
Given the failure conditions observed and the edge case presented, the program does not account for all possible configurations of the pixels correctly. Hence, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
