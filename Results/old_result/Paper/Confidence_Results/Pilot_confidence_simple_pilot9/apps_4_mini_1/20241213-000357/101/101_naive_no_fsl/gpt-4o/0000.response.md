Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle the case where the white pixels ('w') do not form a connected component, or the minimum frame cannot be formed without leaving white pixels inside the frame, or when a frame cannot be formed due to the absence of sufficient surrounding black pixels ('.'). 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5
..... 
.w...
..w..
```

In this case:

1. The topmost row is entirely black.
2. The 'w's form two separate components that are not connected.
3. Since there isnâ€™t a way to surround both 'w's with a continuous frame without gaps, the program should return `-1`. 

However, due to logic flaws in determining the frame boundaries and dimensions in the code (particularly lines that check frame height and width), the expected output in this scenario would not be produced. The logic assumes a frame can be created irrespective of the placement of 'w' pixels. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly, leading to a result of **False**.
