Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly generate the sequence of fractions for all valid inputs and does not adhere to the problem constraints. For example, for input `n = 3`, the expected output should be "YES" with the sequence `1 2` since `1/2 = 1 - 1/3`. However, the current implementation only checks for `n = 2` and subsequently outputs a fixed sequence for any `n > 2`, regardless of the actual valid denominators. The output for `n = 3` would mistakenly yield "YES" and `k = 2`, with `1 1` and `1 3`, which is incorrect as `1` cannot be a valid denominator (it doesn't satisfy `1 < b_i < n`).
