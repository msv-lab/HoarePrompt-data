Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of seconds needed to reduce the side length from `x` to `y` while maintaining the rules for a non-degenerate triangle. 

The program simply calculates `abs(x - y)`, which does not account for the requirement that during the transformation, each side must remain equal and must not form a degenerate triangle. 

For example, using the input `6 3`:
- The required steps to go from `(6, 6, 6)` to `(3, 3, 3)` are: 
    1. `(6, 6, 6) -> (6, 6, 3)` 
    2. `(6, 6, 3) -> (6, 4, 3)` 
    3. `(6, 4, 3) -> (3, 4, 3)` 
    4. `(3, 4, 3) -> (3, 3, 3)` 

This results in a total of 4 seconds, whereas `abs(6-3)` gives only 3, showcasing incorrect logic. Therefore, since the program fails to provide the correct number of seconds needed, it is incorrect.
