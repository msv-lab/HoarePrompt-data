Correctness: **False**

The given program is intended to compare two numbers represented in a "golden system" using the mathematical properties of the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). While the core logic in the function `func_1` calculates the value correctly for the given inputs, the implementation overlooks an important edge case related to the representation of the numbers.

Case to consider:
For inputs like:
```
0001
1
```
The first number `0001` should evaluate to the same value as `1` in the golden system, which is \( q^0 \) and \( q^0 \). Thus, they should be considered equal, and the output should be `=`. However, since the implementation directly compares the computed values from the strings without any additional checks or standardization of the string (like removing leading zeros), it may produce unexpected results or inconsistencies.

Therefore, this discrepancy highlights that the program does not handle potential cases of leading zeros correctly and does not treat `0001` and `1` as equal properly, leading to an incorrect output in such scenarios. Hence, the program does not fulfill all requirements as stated in the problem description.
