Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where `n` can be expressed as a sum of less than `k` quantities without violating the lexicographical order requirement. Specifically, the program fails in the following scenario:

**Example Case:**
Input: 
```
2 4
```

- The output for this case should logically be "No", because it's impossible to express `n = 2` as the sum of four different powers of two such that their total equals two, while obeying the requirement for the maximum exponent to be as small as possible (the smallest possible y value). 
- However, the program does not correctly identify that there is no way to form four terms (2^1 or 2^0) which would equal 2. 

Thus, the program incorrectly returns "Yes" and attempts to return some set of powers, which demonstrates that it can give erroneous outputs for certain inputs. Hence, the program is incorrect for this specific case where the number of integers `k` exceeds `n`, and all other cases cannot meet the requirements.
