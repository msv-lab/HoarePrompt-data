To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to verify if it accurately calculates the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use to prepare the compote while adhering to the specified ratio of lemons, apples, and pears.

The relevant parts of the problem indicate that:
- For every lemon, 2 apples are required and 4 pears are needed.
- The maximum number of lemons that can be used is constrained by the number of lemons available (\(a\)), half the number of apples available (\(b // 2\)), and a quarter of the number of pears available (\(c // 4\)).
- If the quantities of fruits available don't allow for at least one complete set (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears), the output should be 0.

The program computes the maximum number of lemons that can be utilized with the formula:
```python
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
```
Then it calculates the total number of fruits used:
```python
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```
This effectively simplifies to:
```python
total_fruits = max_lemons * 7
```
Finally, the result is printed.

Now, let's consider a crucial aspect: the handling of edge cases. 

1. **Minimum Case**: If \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 1\), the output should be 0 since there aren't sufficient apples or pears.
   - Calculation: 
     - \(max\_lemons = \min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4) = \min(1, 0, 0) = 0\)
     - Thus, total fruits would be \(0 \times 7 = 0\), which is correct.

2. **Single Fruit Type**: If \(a = 0\), \(b = 5\), \(c = 8\), this should also yield 0 because no lemons are available to start with.
   - However, since the problem description states \(1 â‰¤ a\), this case falls outside the specified limits. 

3. **Boundary Conditions**: If he has enough fruits but still fails to meet requirements exactly such as very close counts like \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), \(c = 4\):
   - Here, \(max\_lemons = \min(2, 3 // 2, 4 // 4) = \min(2, 1, 1) = 1\)
   - The output will be correctly computed as \(1 \times 7 = 7\).

From the above inputs and expected outputs, the logical flow of the algorithm seems intact, and all test cases align with the problem description.

In conclusion, I see that all provided examples align with the constraints of the problem description, and I cannot find any edge case where the program fails to comply.

Therefore, the evaluation result is:

Correctness: **True**.
