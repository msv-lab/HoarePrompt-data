Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make the compote according to the specified 1:2:4 ratio.

Here's how the program works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c) from input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits:
   - The maximum lemons used cannot exceed the number of lemons available (`a`).
   - It also must ensure there are enough apples: since 1 lemon requires 2 apples, the maximum lemons that can be used based on apples is `b // 2`.
   - Likewise, for pears, since 1 lemon requires 4 pears, the maximum lemons from pears is `c // 4`.
3. It takes the minimum of these three values to find the maximum number of lemons that can be used.
4. Finally, it computes the total number of fruits used in the compote by summing `max_lemons * 1` (lemons) + `max_lemons * 2` (apples) + `max_lemons * 4` (pears), which correctly calculates the total number of fruits.

The program seems to handle the problem constraints correctly, and the edge cases (such as when not enough fruits are available to make the compote) are addressed by calculating the maximum possible lemons first, ensuring that no negative or fractional fruits are included in the calculation. 

All provided examples and additional test cases (like when one type of fruit is zero or significantly lower than the others) still lead to valid outputs per the specifications. Hence, I find no condition where the program fails, confirming its correctness.
