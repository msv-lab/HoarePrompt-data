To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to carefully analyze both the logic implied by the problem and the program's implementation.

1. **Understanding `f(p)` and `f_max(n)`**:
   - The function `f(p)` counts distinct GCD values of prefixes of a permutation of the numbers `1` to `n`.
   - `f_max(n)` is the maximum possible value of `f(p)` across all permutations of these numbers.

2. **Reviewing the program**:
   - We begin by parsing the input to obtain `n`.
   - Then `func_2(n)` calculates `f_max(n)`. However, the implementation for `func_2` does not accurately compute the maximum number of distinct GCDs for permutations.
      - In fact, for a permutation `p`, `g_i` could equal `1` for many configurations, especially if `p` starts with `1`, leading to potentially undercounting for larger `n`.
   - The `func_3(n, f_max_n)` function constructs a dynamic programming (DP) table to calculate the number of ways of achieving the maximum number of distinct GCDs for the permutations.
   - The way `dp` is updated might not correctly reflect the desired outcomes due to previously discussed issues with `f_max_n`.

3. **Identifying potential edge cases**:
   - Consider `n = 2`:
     - Possible permutations of `[1, 2]` are `[1, 2]` and `[2, 1]`. Here `f([1, 2]) = 1` and `f([2, 1]) = 1`, suggesting `f_max(2) = 1`. Thus, there’s exactly 1 permutation yielding this maximum.
   - Now take `n = 3`:
     - The output of `4` matches the expected number of permutations that yield the maximum distinct GCDs. However, testing larger values of `n` begins to expose flaws since needed calculations for `f_max(n)` aren't robust due to how GCD values propagate.

4. **Conclusive check**:
   - Testing boundaries, if we evaluate for `n = 4` or above, the constraints here imply that various permutations will yield varied GCD outputs which likely won’t align with `func_2`'s counting mechanism.
   - Specifically, `f(p)` can have complex behavior depending on arrangement — since arriving at a distinct count requires careful grouping by GCD behaviors that this program doesn’t capture correctly.

In conclusion, through the analysis, we find that there are indeed scenarios where this implementation does not correctly compute the number of permutations for maximal distinct GCDs due to incorrectly calculating `f_max(n)`.

Therefore, the overall correctness is:
Correctness: **False**
