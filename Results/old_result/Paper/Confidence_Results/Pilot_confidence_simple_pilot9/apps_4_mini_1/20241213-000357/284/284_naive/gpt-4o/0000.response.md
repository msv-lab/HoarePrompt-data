To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to determine if the program reliably finds an `m` for each positive integer `n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)` such that `n·m + 1` is not a prime number.

Let's review the program:

1. The program reads an integer `n` from input.
2. It loops over values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. For each `m`, it calculates the expression `n * m + 1` and checks if it is not a prime number using the `func_1` function.
4. If a non-prime value is found, it outputs `m` and stops further execution.

### Checking the primality function (`func_1`):

- It correctly identifies numbers less than or equal to 1 as not prime.
- It identifies 2 and 3 as prime.
- It checks for divisibility by 2 and 3.
- It uses the 6k ± 1 rule to check potential factors.

### Exploring potential edge cases:
1. **Handling `m=1`**: For `m=1`, the output will be `n * 1 + 1 = n + 1`. 
   - If `n + 1` is prime, the program will continue checking with subsequent values of `m`.
   
2. **Considering values of `n`**: The program is guaranteed that a non-prime will exist for 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Examples:
   - For `n = 1`: `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime) but `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (prime), and will eventually output a non-prime for some `m` within 1000.
   - For `n = 2`: `2 * 1 + 1 = 3` (prime), outputs an `m` value that results in a non-prime for some other `m` within 1000.
  
However, while the program theoretically works through any value, we must check if there’s a scenario where **no** suitable `m` can be found for any valid `n`. 

### Counterexample:
Upon careful thought, for values of `n` that result in all expressions of form `n·m + 1` being prime for small integer values of `m` quickly results in a situation where the program could output an `m` that does not work within the upper limits, specifically if there are no composite results within that range especially when `m` is limited.

### Conclusion:
There are instances where patterns (especially among smaller `n` values such as 3 or 4) require exploration. The function fails to guarantee a non-prime within its search limit if it falsely concludes once.

Thus we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not reliably find a value of `m` such that `n·m + 1` is non-prime for critical cases, where the program may exit while all results tested return primes up to its operational limit. For example, `n=3` and outputs up to `m=5` yield prime results, even though a counterexample exists technically outside those boundaries within functional range.
