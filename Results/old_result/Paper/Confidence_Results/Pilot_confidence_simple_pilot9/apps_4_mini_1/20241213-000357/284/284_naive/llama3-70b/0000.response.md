To assess the correctness of the provided program, we begin by analyzing the problem statement and comparing it with the implementation.

### Problem Statement Summary:
The task is to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis, which states that for each positive integer \( n \), there exists a positive integer \( m \) such that the expression \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime. The constraints specify that \( n \) will be between 1 and 1000, and \( m \) must also be in the range 1 to 1000.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program takes an integer \( n \) as input and iterates over \( m \) from 1 to 1000. It checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number using the function `func_1`. If a non-prime number is found, it prints the corresponding \( m \) value.

```python
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Prime Checking Logic (`func_1`)**: 
   - The function correctly identifies prime numbers for numbers greater than or equal to 2. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2, which is correct behavior for the definition of prime numbers.
   
2. **Iteration Over \( m \)**:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to 1000 for \( m \), which adheres to the input constraints. The break statement ensures that the program stops after finding the first valid \( m \).

3. **Counterexample Output**:
   - The program prints \( m \) when it finds \( n \cdot m + 1 \) that is not prime, adhering to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Upon considering potential edge cases, including the scenario where \( n = 1 \):
- For \( n = 1, m = 1 \): \( 1 \cdot 1 + 1 = 2 \) (which is prime).
- For \( n = 1, m = 2 \): \( 1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3 \) (which is prime).
- Continuing this for \( m \) up to 1000, all outputs will yield prime numbers (2, 3, ..., 1001).

However, if we check for \( n = 1 \) specifically, it would mean the function could possibly fail to output a counterexample since \( n \cdot m + 1 \) remains prime for those values.

Given the loop continues until it finds a suitable \( m \), it means there's no guarantee that a valid \( m \) will be found when \( n \) is 1 even though it's specified that an answer exists.

Therefore, as the program does not handle the case when \( n = 1 \) correctly and might not provide an output in this situation:

Correctness: **False**.
