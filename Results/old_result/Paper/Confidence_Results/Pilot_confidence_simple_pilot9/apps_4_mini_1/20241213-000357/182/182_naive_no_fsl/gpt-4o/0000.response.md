Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the case when the angle is a multiple of 90 that points directly down. For example, the input `180` would imply that the camera is facing completely opposite to the "true up", and the expected output should be `2` since it takes two `90 degrees` clockwise turns to correct this. 

However, in the current implementation:

1. For `180`, the normalized angle would be `180 % 360 = 180`.
2. The calculated number of turns would be `(360 - 180) // 90 % 4 = (180) // 90 % 4 = 2 % 4 = 2`, which is correct in this case.

However, if we take `-180`, it would actually represent the same position but derived from a different direction.

For `-180`, the behavior is not explicitly called out in the output or in the algorithm. The derived behavior lacks clarity on how angles derived from `negative` inputs are handled consistently.

Additionally, if we evaluate `360`, the expected number of `90 deg` rotations should be `0`, but due to the way the current modulo operation is done, it may get calculated into invalid angle representations when adjusted for negative rotations which may lead to incorrect assumptions/output where adjustments aren't made effectively.

The algorithm thus can misrepresent valid cases derived from either positive or negative angles, particularly in the edge cases leading to ambiguity and potentially incorrect output for any input that translates into full, half or rotation representations leading to exact opposites. 

Thus, the program does not make clear handling across the spectrum of valid input ranges and their respective outputs as described, leading to inconsistency in expected results. Therefore, it wouldn't be reliable across absolute angle contrasts effectively derived from positional rotations as discussed in the problem statement.
