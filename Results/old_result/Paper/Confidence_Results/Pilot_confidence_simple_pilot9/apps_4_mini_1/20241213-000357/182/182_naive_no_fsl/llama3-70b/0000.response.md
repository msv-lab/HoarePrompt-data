Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements described in the problem statement for all potential cases. 

For example, consider the case when the input is `-150`. According to the problem, the resulting clockwise rotations for `-150` degrees should yield the minimal deviation from vertical. 

1. The angle `-150` degrees results in a clockwise rotation of `150` degrees (because rotation is counter-clockwise).
2. The program currently processes the input as follows:
   - When `-150` is reduced modulo `360`, it results in `210`.
   - The calculated output will be `(210 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which yields `2`.
3. However, the correct output should be `2` turns since `-150` requires two clockwise turns of `90` degrees (which would bring the picture to a `30` degree deviation, the minimum). 

But as per the requirements of deviation, the minimum possible deviation from vertical after `2` clockwise turns results in `30 degrees`, indicating that it is indeed working correctly in reducing the deviation, but the misrepresentation arises from the output logic. 

Thus, the logic fails to correctly calculate some instances, such as `-150`, rendering the overall implementation incorrect. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
