Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if the total amount of game-coins `n` can be exactly spent on houses, cars, and computers given their respective costs. The nested loops iterate over the possible quantities of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`), and for each combination, it checks if the remaining coins can be completely spent on computers (`c`). 

All input values within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) are handled, and the algorithm will find a solution if it exists. The logic covers all possible combinations of purchases within the constraints defined by the problem description, ensuring that it checks every feasible scenario. Thus, it provides the correct output of "YES" or "NO". 

In scenarios where the remaining after houses and cars is correctly divisible by the computer cost, the function will return "YES". For all other cases, it will return "NO". The algorithm comprehensively tests all possibilities without missing any edge cases or logical fallacies, making it robust.
