To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we will break down the logic of the code and identify any potential edge cases that might not be properly handled.

The program aims to find the maximum expected number of fishes that can be caught with a scoop-net of size `r x r` in a pond of dimensions `n x m`, after placing `k` fishes in distinct cells within the pond.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant components:

1. **Function to Calculate Coverage**: The `coverage` function calculates how many positions of the scoop-net can overlap with a fish located at `(x, y)`. The logic here might be flawed if the calculations are incorrect:
   - The coverage calculation involves taking the minimum and maximum values based on the position and size of the scoop-net. 

2. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a heap to sort potential positions based on their coverage, and selects the top `k` positions to maximize fish catch.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected number of fish is determined by dividing the total coverage from selected positions by the total number of valid positions where the scoop can be placed.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - What happens if `k` fishes are placed such that they exceed the possible scoop coverage? 
   - If `n`, `m`, `r`, or `k` are at their minimum values (1), how does the function handle it?
   - The behavior when the number of fishes (`k`) is zero or when the pond is very small compared to the scoop size.

### Edge Case Testing:
1. **Minimum Input Case**: If `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `r = 1`, and `k = 1`, the output should return `1.0000000000`. This case should properly compute coverage since there's only one position and one fish.

2. **More Fishes Than Cells**: If `k = 2` but the pond can only accommodate one fish because the size of the pond is too small (e.g., `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `r = 1`, `k = 2`), the program will need to return an expected value reflecting the impossibility of catching more than one fish.

3. **Invalid Positions**: Testing where `n`, `m`, `r` or `k` could lead to situations where the scoop-net can only partially cover cells, and confirming whether the edge cases yield valid expected values.

After thoroughly analyzing the code and potential edge cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

**Reason**: The program does not properly handle the case where the number of fishes exceeds the number of distinct locations (`k` exceeds `n * m`). This can result in invalid calculations or assumptions leading to erroneous outputs, such as returning a non-integer or incorrect expected value when all positions are not possible due to overcrowding of fishes. The coverage calculation logic also could lead to incorrect averages when the scoop can cover more than one fish on the edges of the pond, showing that the function may not accurately reflect expected values for all configurations.
