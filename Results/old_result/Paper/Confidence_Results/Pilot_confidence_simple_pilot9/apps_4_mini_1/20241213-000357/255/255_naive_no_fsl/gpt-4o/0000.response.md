To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic implemented in the `func()` function.

The goal is to find the minimum number of operations to delete the entire string, where in each operation you can remove a contiguous substring of equal characters.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads an integer `n` (length of the string) and the string `s`.
2. **Operations Count**: The variable `operations` starts at 1. The function then iterates through the string starting from the second character (index 1). For each character `s[i]`, if it is different from the previous character `s[i - 1]`, the program increments the `operations` count.
3. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of operations.

### Logic Review
The logic employed in the program essentially counts how many "blocks" of contiguous equal characters are present in the string. The fundamental problem here is that this does not directly correlate to the number of deletions required to remove the string entirely as per the rules provided.

### Edge Case
Consider the following edge case:
- **Input**:
    ```
    6
    aaaaa
    ```
- **Expected Output**: The expected output for this case is `1`, since you can remove all 'a's in one operation.
- **Actual Output**: The program would output `1`, as it correctly identifies that there is only one block.

Another edge case that illustrates the program's flaws:
- **Input**:
    ```
    5
    aaabb
    ```
- **Expected Output**: The expected output is `2` (one operation to remove "aaa" and another for "bb").
- **Actual Output**: The program would output `3`, counting two transitions from `a` to `b`.

### Conclusion
The counting mechanism used to determine operations does not effectively represent the minimum number of operations needed to clear substrings of equal characters. 

The program does not satisfy the requirements for all strategic cases; there exists a case where it returns an invalid output. 

Thus, the examination leads us to conclude:

Correctness: **False**
