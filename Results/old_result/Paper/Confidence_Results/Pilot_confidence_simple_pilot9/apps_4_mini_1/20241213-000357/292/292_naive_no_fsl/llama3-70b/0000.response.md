Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly evaluates the number of years it will take for Limak's weight (which triples each year) to exceed Bob's weight (which doubles each year). It appropriately uses a while loop to continually update Limak’s and Bob’s weights until Limak’s weight is strictly greater than Bob's. The logic holds for all inputs within the given constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), as seen in the provided examples. 

To summarize the behavior:

1. Both weights are read from input.
2. A counter for years is initialized.
3. The program enters a loop where it updates Limak's weight by tripling it and Bob's weight by doubling it until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.
4. It counts the number of iterations (years) taken for this condition to be met and prints the result.

Since all weights start with Limak being less than or equal to Bob, and the updates guarantee that Limak will grow faster, the program will always find the correct number of years according to the problem description. Every potential case adheres to the requirements specified, ensuring correctness.
