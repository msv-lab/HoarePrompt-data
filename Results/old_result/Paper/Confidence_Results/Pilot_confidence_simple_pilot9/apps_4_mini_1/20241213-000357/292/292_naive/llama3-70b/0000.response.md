Correctness: **False**.

The provided program fails to account for the scenario where Limak's initial weight is equal to Bob's weight. According to the problem description, Limak needs to become strictly heavier than Bob, meaning that the program should account for the case where they are equal at the start.

For example, if we input `1 1` (where both have the same weight), the program will calculate:

- Year 1: Limak's weight becomes `3` and Bob's weight becomes `2`. The program correctly concludes that Limak is larger after 1 year, but fails to correctly interpret the need for Limak to be heavier than Bob at the start.

This inconsistency demonstrates that the program does not adhere strictly to the requirements in the problem description for all potential cases, leading to an incorrect result.
