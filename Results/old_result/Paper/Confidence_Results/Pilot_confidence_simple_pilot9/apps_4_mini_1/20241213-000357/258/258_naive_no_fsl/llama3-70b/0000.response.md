Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not work correctly for the problem description due to the following issues:

1. **Grid Search Limitations**: The program performs a grid search over the coordinate range from -1000 to 1000 for both X and Y by using integer values only. This is not sufficient to find the optimal placement of the heat source. The optimal point may not lie on the integer grid; it can be any real number. Thus, the resolution of the search (only integers) may lead to suboptimal solutions.

2. **Sorting Error**: The program sorts the computed times and retrieves the K-th time for meat to be ready. While this does provide the correct K-th element under the current mechanism, it is contingent on the flawed assumption of where the source can be placed.

3. **Ignoring Optimal Placement**: The program simply returns the K-th time without actually ensuring that it has checked for the absolute optimal placement of the heat source.

An example that highlights these issues:
- Consider N = 4, K = 3, and the following inputs:
```
4 3
1 1 1
-1 1 1
1 -1 1
-1 -1 1
```
If you place the heat source at (0,0), this might yield a reasonable approach, but another placement (for instance, on the edges of the spots, like slightly closer to one of the meats) might yield significantly less time for K pieces to be ready. Since the current implementation uses grid search, it may miss optimal coordinates, yielding a time that is not truly the minimum possible.

Therefore, due to resolving this inaccuracy and oversight in seeking a proper solution, the program is deemed incorrect.

In conclusion, the shortcomings in coordinate placement resolution directly invalidate the program from correctly implementing the problem's requirements, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness in its operation.
