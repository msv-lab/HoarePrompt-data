To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the implementation and check its behavior against various inputs.

### Problem Breakdown

Vasya wants to find three integer points such that:
1. The coordinates of the points must lie within the bounds:
   - \(0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n\)
   - \(0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m\)

2. The area of the triangle formed by these points should be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Code Analysis

Here are the critical components of the code provided:

1. **Checking Area Feasibility**: The program checks if \(n \times m \% k\) is not equal to zero. If it’s not zero, it prints "NO" because it indicates that \(\frac{nm}{k}\) cannot be an integer (the area of the triangle must be a whole number).

2. **Calculating Points**:
   - The function `func_3(a, b)` seems to be aimed at computing a result based on the extended Euclidean algorithm. However, there's confusion in its interpretation regarding generating the coordinates of the triangle.

3. **Printing Points**: 
   - If it reaches the conclusion to print "YES," it outputs three points. These points include (0, 0), (0, n1 * m // g), and (m1 * m // g, 0). 

### Points of Concern:

1. **Area Calculation**:
   - The printed points need to be checked to ensure they form a valid triangle and that the area formed is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The area of triangles formed by coordinates \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) needs to be evaluated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
   \]

2. **Potential Case**:
   A potential problematic case can be observed when \(k\) is larger than \(nm\). For instance, select \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 3\). Here, \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{1}{3}\), which isn’t a valid area for a triangle.
   - The program will still print "NO" correctly for this case, as \(n \times m \mod k \) will be satisfied.
   - However, if the code proceeds, it could provide incorrect coordinates that do not yield an area of \(\frac{1}{3}\), leading to inconsistency.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic, it seems the program has the potential to get the area condition wrong in certain scenarios, especially around boundary cases where \(k\) relates nonsensically to \(nm\). 

However, without additional corner cases or further analysis beyond what's covered, I am unable to concretely provide an instance where it fails to meet expectations strictly. Most checks do seem to validate conditions, but I can't confirm with absolute certainty it covers all edge cases, especially for maximum limits. 

Hence, the correctness of the program based on the criteria of being entirely correct is:

Correctness: **False**
