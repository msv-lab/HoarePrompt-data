To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the situation it needs to handle.

### Problem Description Review
Vasya needs to find three integer points such that:
- \(0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n\)
- \(0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m\)
- The area of the triangle formed by these points should be exactly \(\frac{n \cdot m}{k}\).

### Program Analysis
The program does the following:
1. It reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
2. It calculates the area that should be matched.
3. If the calculated area is not an integer, it outputs "NO".
4. It also checks if the computed area is zero and outputs "NO" in that case.
5. If the area is a valid integer, it attempts to generate three points based on specific conditions.

#### Potential Issues
1. **Area Not An Integer**: If \(nm \mod k \neq 0\), the area won't be an integer. The program correctly identifies this.
  
2. **Generating Points**:
    - The program uses \(2 \times \text{area}\) to set coordinates and checks for limits with \(n\) and \(m\).
    - There is a risk that the resulting coordinates may go out of bounds or may not actually form a valid triangle of the specified area.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - If \(k > nm\), the area would be less than one, which means forming a triangle isn't possible (the triangle area must be non-negative).
    - The code generates points, such as `(2 * area, 1)` and `(0, 1)`, which assumes \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\). In instances where \(n\) is very small or specific conditions on \(m\) and \(k\) exist, these coordinates may not satisfy the triangle area properties.

### Test For Failure
Let's consider the case when:
- \(n = 1\)
- \(m = 1\)
- \(k = 2\)

In this situation:
- Area = \( \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5\), which is not valid.
- The program will output "NO", which is correct for this case.

Now, letâ€™s check with maximum bounds:
- \(n = 10^9\)
- \(m = 10^9\)
- \(k = 2\)

In this input:
- Area = \( \frac{10^9 \cdot 10^9}{2} = 5 \times 10^{17}\), which is an integer.

When it tries to generate points, if anything goes out of the available range of points, or does not adhere to creating a triangle with the desired area, it will not be able to satisfy the conditions stated in the problem description resulting in validity issues.

#### Conclusion of Analysis
Given the complexity and various edge cases (like non-integer area computations and triangle coordinate validity), the program's logic may fail to return valid triangle points in certain scenarios depending on the provided \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).

Correctness: **False**. 

**Reasoning**: The program does not ensure that the coordinates generated actually create a triangle of the specified area in all cases, particularly when those inputs can lead to points being out of bounds or not satisfying area conditions.
