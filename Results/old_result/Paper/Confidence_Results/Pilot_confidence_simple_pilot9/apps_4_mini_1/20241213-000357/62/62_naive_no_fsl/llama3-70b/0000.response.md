Correctness: **True**

The provided program translates the digits of numbers X and Y from their respective bases into base 10 integers and correctly compares those integers. 

### Explanation:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program successfully reads and splits the input to extract the digits and bases for both numbers X and Y.
  
2. **Conversion Logic**: The function `func_1` converts a list of digits from a specified base into a decimal integer using the formula `result = result * base + digit`, which is the correct way to compute the value of a number represented in a specific base.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers to base 10 using `func_1`, the program uses simple comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `=`) to print the correct relationship between X and Y.

The code handles potential edge cases appropriately, such as:
- Different bases (ensured by the restriction `b_{x} ≠ b_{y}` in the problem description).
- Non-negative digits (0 ≤ x_i < b_{x} and 0 ≤ y_i < b_{y}).
- Valid input constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10).

Given that the program appears to handle all outlined considerations correctly and that no counterexamples can be immediately identified in the scope of the problem description, it's reasonable to conclude that the implementation is valid.
