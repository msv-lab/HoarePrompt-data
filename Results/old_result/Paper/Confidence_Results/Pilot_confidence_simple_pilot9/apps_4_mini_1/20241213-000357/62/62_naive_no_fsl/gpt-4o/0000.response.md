Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers represented in different bases based on the problem description. 

Here's a brief explanation of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes the input as specified, reading the number of digits and base for both numbers, followed by the respective digits.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The function `func_1` converts the digits of a number from its respective base to a decimal integer. This is done using a standard technique of accumulating the decimal value by multiplying the current value by the base and adding the next digit.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to decimal, it compares them and prints the appropriate symbol ('<', '>', or '=').

4. **Edge Cases**: The program adheres to the constraints given (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 and 2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40), ensuring that it only processes valid inputs without leading zeros or negative values, as guaranteed by the problem statement.

Since I cannot find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected with respect to the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct. Thus, the output for correctness is marked as True.
