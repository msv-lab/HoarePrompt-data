To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we analyze the requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Inputs**: We have four integers: `N` (total distinct coins), `M` (friends), `K` (coins Ivan already has), and `L` (minimum new coins in Ivan's collection).
2. **Outputs**: The minimal number of coins each friend should gift or `-1` if it's impossible.

### Requirements:
- All friends must gift the same number of coins.
- All gifted coins must be distinct.
- At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection that he does not already own.

### Program Logic:
1. Calculate the minimum number of coins per friend using `(L + M - 1) // M`, ensuring that we round up if thereâ€™s a remainder. This calculates how many coins each friend needs to gift to meet the `L` new coins requirement.
2. Then, it checks if the total coins from all friends (`M * min_x`) can fit the available coins (`N - K`), which is the total new coins possible since Ivan already has `K`.

### Potential Cases:
Let's go through the logic and consider possible edge cases:
1. **When `M * min_x > N - K`**: The program correctly returns `-1`, indicating it's impossible to gift enough distinct coins.
2. **When `L` is greater than `N - K`**: This would mean that it's impossible to meet the minimum new coins requirement since there aren't enough new coins available.

### Issues with the Implementation:
One critical flaw is in the logic when `L` is greater than the total number of available coins (`N - K`). The program currently checks if `M * min_x <= N - K`, but it doesn't directly consider if `L > N - K` before calculating `min_x`. This could lead to situations where the program incorrectly determines a value for `min_x` that is not feasible.

**Example of Failure**:
- Consider `N = 5`, `M = 1`, `K = 3`, and `L = 3`. The available new coins are `N - K = 2`, which is less than `L = 3`. Thus, it is impossible for one friend to gift enough coins while satisfying the conditions. The expected output should be `-1`, but the program will incorrectly compute a `min_x` and give an answer.

### Conclusion:
Since we identified a case where the program produces incorrect results based on the problem description, the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **False**.
