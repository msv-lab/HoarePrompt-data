Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the situation where it is impossible for Ivan's friends to gift him coins that satisfy all the terms. Specifically, it checks whether the number of friends `M` is at least the number of distinct coins needed (`N - K + 1`), but it fails to ensure that each friend can give a different coin while also satisfying the requirement of at least `L` new coins.

Here are a few critical cases where the program fails:

1. If `N = 2`, `M = 2`, `K = 1`, and `L = 2`, the output should be `-1`. In this scenario, Ivan already has 1 coin and there are only 2 distinct coins in total. Since all friends must give different coins and at least 2 new coins are required, this case cannot be satisfied. However, the program would incorrectly print `1` because it checks only if `M >= N - K + 1`, which is `2 >= 2`, and `M >= L`, which is `2 >= 2`.

2. If `N = 10`, `M = 11`, `K = 2`, and `L = 4`, the program correctly outputs `-1` but only because it checks `M >= N - K + 1` (which evaluates `11 >= 9`). However, there should be additional checks ensuring that at least `L` friends can give a new coin from the overall selection.

The logic needs to explicitly handle the case where `M > N` as well as ensuring that the gifting can yield at least `L` new coins from distinct options. Thus, the logic is incomplete, and there exist potential input cases that are not correctly handled, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
