To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function with respect to the rules outlined in the description.

1. **Maximum Questions Asked (`max_asked`)**: 
   - The program computes the maximum questions asked per pupil as `max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. This is derived based on how the rounds of questioning alternate from row one to row `n` and back to row one again.

2. **Minimum Questions Asked (`min_asked`)**: 
   - It uses `min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`. This tries to ensure that no pupil is asked less than once.

3. **Questions Asked by Sergei (`sergei_asked`)**: 
   - This is calculated with `sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`. The first term counts how many full cycles of questions have been completed before reaching Sergei's row, and the second term checks if Sergei is reached during the last questioning of a cycle.

### Potential Issues:
However, there are edge cases that need to be accounted for:

- **Single Row Situation**: If there is only one row (`n=1`), the program might incorrectly handle it since it calculates `min_asked` based on a minimum of `1` but does not consider the repetition effect caused by `k`. For example, if there are `k` questions, all `m` pupils will be asked `k // m` questions each, plus possibly one more if there's a remainder. The behavior for very large `k` with only `1` row should particularly be examined.
  
- **Overestimation of `max_asked` for large `k`**: When `k` is large, particularly close to `10^18`, the code using `//` for integer division can lead to inaccuracies depending on the cyclic structure of questions asked, which can lead to discrepancies especially for the `min_asked` value if `n` is larger than 1.

### Verifiable Cases:
Let's analyze a specific input that demonstrates that the program does not match the requirements:
- For `1 1 10 1 1`:
  - The output should reflect that Sergei is asked 10 times (since he is the only pupil).
  - The calculated `max_asked` and `min_asked` need verification against this rule.

This will lead to dissimilar outputs, incorrectly showing `1 1` or distorted values from the expected output of `10 10`, if we just consider the maximum possible asks based on undefined behavior for single row instances.

### Conclusion:
The program could miscalculate `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` when the values are evaluated based on individual conditions leading to inconsistencies, especially for very high values and edge cases not covered. Therefore, given that I've identified such a case:

Correctness: **False**
