Correctness: **False**

The program is not correct because it incorrectly determines the conditions under which it is possible for at least one garland to be lit at all times after switching them on. The determination is made solely by checking if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) is equal to 1.

For example, consider the input:

```
6 10 15
```

The GCD of 6, 10, and 15 is 1, so according to the program, it would print "YES". However, in reality, there will be seconds where no garland is lit, because the periods of the garlands will miss certain multiples, leading to gaps where no garland lights up. 

The correct approach should involve ensuring overlapping coverage of the time periods defined by the intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \). The mistake lies in the program's logic regarding the intervals, thus it does not accurately handle all edge cases defined in the problem description.
