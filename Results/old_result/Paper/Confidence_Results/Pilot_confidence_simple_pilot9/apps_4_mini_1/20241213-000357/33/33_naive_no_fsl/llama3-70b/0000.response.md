Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle the case when Limak moves only "East" or "West". According to the problem description, moving in these directions should not be allowed when at the extreme poles (North Pole or South Pole). The program does not check for movements in the "East" or "West" direction if Limak is at either pole and will continue to allow those moves without any restriction.

For example:
- If the input is:
```
2
20000 South
10000 East
```
The program will allow moving "East" while at the South Pole (after moving South 20000 km), which is against the conditions specified in the problem description, resulting in an invalid journey. 

This demonstrates that the program does not meet all the requirements set forth in the problem description. Therefore, its correctness is denied.
