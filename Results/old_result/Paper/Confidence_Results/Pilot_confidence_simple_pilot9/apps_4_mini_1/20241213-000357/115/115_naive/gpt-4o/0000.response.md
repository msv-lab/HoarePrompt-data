To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the implementation step-by-step and identify any potential cases where it might fail.

### Key Aspects of the Problem
1. We have two matrices \( A \) (the target matrix) and \( B \) (which is initialized to all zeros).
2. We can operate on \( B \) by selecting any \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix and setting all of its elements to 1.
3. The goal is to determine if it is possible to make \( B \) equal to \( A \) using these operations.
4. If possible, output the number of operations and their respective coordinates; otherwise, output -1.

### Examination of the Program
1. **Matrix Setup**: The program reads inputs correctly and initializes the matrices \( A \) and \( B \).
2. **Operation Logic**: The program checks for each \( 2 \times 2 \) section of \( A \) to determine if all four elements are 1:
    - If they are, it sets the corresponding section in \( B \) to 1 and records the operation.
3. **Final Verification**: After recording all possible operations, the program checks if \( A \) and \( B \) are equal, returning -1 if they differ.

### Potential Issues
- The program only marks a \( 2 \times 2 \) section of \( A \) as operable if all four corners are 1. There could be cases where \( A \) has isolated 1s or configurations involving 1s that aren't part of a full \( 2 \times 2 \) square. The program will miss these configurations, as it would return -1 even if the possible operations exist but werenâ€™t recorded.

### Case Where the Program Would Fail
For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
In this case:
- The 1s in matrix \( A \) at positions (1,1), (2,1), (1,3), and (2,3) cannot all be part of a \( 2 \times 2 \) operation, meaning \( B \) would never be made equal to \( A \).
- However, the isolated ones can never allow \( B \) to match \( A \) since there are no \( 2 \times 2 \) squares available.

### Concluding Evaluation
As identified, there are cases where the program does not capture the necessary operations leading to \( B \) becoming equal to \( A \) for all configurations of 1s in \( A \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
