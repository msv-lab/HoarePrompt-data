Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem description requires finding the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. The code solves this problem using a binary search approach.

2. The `func_1(n)` function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`. This function uses the fact that trailing zeroes in `n!` are caused by factors of 5 (since 2 * 5 = 10), and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in `n!`.

3. The `func_2(m)` function uses a binary search approach to find the range of `n` values for which `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It does this by maintaining a search range `[low, high]` and repeatedly dividing it in half until it finds a value of `n` for which `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

4. Once `func_2(m)` finds a value of `n` for which `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes, it expands outwards from this value to find all `n` values for which `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

5. The code handles edge cases correctly, including cases where there are no `n` values for which `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes (in which case it prints 0).

I couldn't find any cases where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. The code seems to be well-structured, efficient, and handles all possible cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
