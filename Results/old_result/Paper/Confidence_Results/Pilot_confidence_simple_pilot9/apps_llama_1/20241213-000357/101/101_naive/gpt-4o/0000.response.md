Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The given program attempts to find the smallest square frame that encompasses all white pixels on the screen, but it does not check whether the found frame actually satisfies the given conditions. 

For example, consider the case where the input is:
```
2 6
w..w.w
...w..
```
The output of the program will be:
```
w..w.w
...w..
```
However, this output does not represent a valid frame because it is not a square. The program should return -1 for this case, indicating that no valid frame exists.

Another issue with the program is that it does not handle cases where the frame size is 1. According to the problem description, a square frame with a size of 1 is a single pixel. However, the program returns -1 for such cases, which is incorrect.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly check for valid frames and handle cases where the frame size is 1. It should also return -1 when no valid frame exists, as required by the problem description. 

The main issue with the code is that it doesn't correctly find the minimum size of the frame and also does not ensure the frame is a square. It should iterate through all possible frames and check if they are valid, returning the smallest one that satisfies the conditions. If no valid frame is found, it should return -1. 

However, the code provided only checks for a frame that encompasses all white pixels and does not guarantee that the frame is the smallest possible or that it is a square. This means the code does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem and therefore is incorrect.
