Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It accurately solves the problem described by identifying the smallest possible square frame that contains all white pixels. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Processing**: The program starts by reading the input, including the resolution of the monitor (`n` and `m`) and the state of each pixel. It correctly identifies and stores the positions of all white pixels in the `white_pixels` list.

2. **Frame Size Calculation**: It calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, which are used to determine the size of the smallest possible square frame. The frame size is calculated as the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum x or y coordinates plus 1.

3. **Boundary Check**: The program checks if the calculated frame size exceeds the dimensions of the monitor. If it does, the program correctly outputs `-1`, indicating that no such frame exists.

4. **Frame Drawing**: If a valid frame can be drawn, the program iterates over each pixel on the monitor. For pixels that are on the border of the calculated frame and are initially black, it draws a frame by marking them with a `+`. White pixels are left unchanged, and other black pixels remain as they are.

The logic of the program is sound, and it handles the constraints given in the problem description. It correctly identifies the smallest possible square frame that contains all white pixels without exceeding the monitor's boundaries. The program does not modify white pixels or draw frames beyond the monitor's borders, adhering to the problem's requirements.

Given that the provided examples are correctly processed by the program, and considering the logic and constraints, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases described in the problem. Without a specific counterexample where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
