Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description and should work for all potential cases. It reads the input for two numbers represented in different bases, converts them to decimal, and compares them.

The function `func_1(digits, base)` correctly calculates the decimal value of a number represented in a given base by iterating over its digits from most significant to least significant and accumulating the value. This is done using the formula `result = result * base + digit`, which is the correct way to convert a number from any base to decimal.

The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description:

- It can handle numbers with any base between 2 and 40.
- It can handle numbers with any number of digits between 1 and 10.
- It can handle numbers without leading zeroes.
- It can handle the comparison of numbers in different bases correctly.

All examples provided are also correctly handled by the program:

- The first example correctly outputs '=' since both numbers are equal when converted to decimal.
- The second example correctly outputs '<' since X is smaller than Y when both are converted to decimal.
- The third example correctly outputs '>' since X is larger than Y when both are converted to decimal.

After thorough analysis, no potential case was found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
