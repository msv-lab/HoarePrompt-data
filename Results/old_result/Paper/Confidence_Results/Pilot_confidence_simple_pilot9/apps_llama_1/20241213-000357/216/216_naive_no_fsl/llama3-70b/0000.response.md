Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions. The code simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string, but it does not check if the lowercase letters are distinct or if there are any uppercase letters between them.

For example, if the input string is "aaaaa", the program will print 5, but the correct answer is 1, because all the letters are the same. 

Another example, if the input string is "aAa", the program will print 2, but the correct answer is 1, because there is an uppercase letter 'A' between the two lowercase letters.

The program does not handle these cases correctly and therefore is incorrect. 

To solve this problem, a more complex approach would be needed, such as using dynamic programming or a backtracking algorithm to find the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters that can be chosen without having any uppercase letters between them. 

Here is an example of how the correct code could look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        count = 0
        used = set()
        for j in range(i, n):
            if s[j].islower() and s[j] not in used:
                used.add(s[j])
                count += 1
            elif s[j].isupper():
                break
            max_count = max(max_count, count)
    print(max_count)
```
