Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used to make the compote, taking into account the required ratios of apples and pears. The `min` function is used to find the smallest number of lemons that can be used, given the available quantities of apples and pears. This ensures that the program does not attempt to use more apples or pears than are available.

The program then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote, by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by the required ratios of apples and pears. This is done correctly, and the program prints the total number of fruits that can be used.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program handles the examples provided in the problem statement correctly, and it appears to handle all possible input cases correctly. The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the program only uses whole fruits, as required by the problem statement.
