Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it only counts the pairs of integers (a, b) where a ≤ b, due to the line `for b in range(a, r + 1):`. However, according to the problem description, pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b. This means the program is missing the cases where a > b.

To fix this, the program should also count the pairs where a > b, or alternatively, it should count all pairs (a, b) and then multiply the result by 2, since each pair (a, b) has a corresponding pair (b, a) unless a = b. 

For example, if the input is 1 12 1 12, the program will only count the pairs (1, 12) and (3, 4) but not (12, 1) and (4, 3), which are also good pairs.
