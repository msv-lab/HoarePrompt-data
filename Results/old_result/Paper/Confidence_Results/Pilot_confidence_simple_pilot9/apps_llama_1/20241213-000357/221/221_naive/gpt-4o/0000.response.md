Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not make use of the given sum `s` and does not consider all possible cases. The current implementation only tries to find `a` and `b` such that `a ^ x = b` and `b ^ x = a`, which is not the correct condition.

For example, given the input `9 5`, the program does not return `4` as expected, because it does not correctly calculate the possible ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy both conditions `a + b = 9` and `a ^ b = 5`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find all possible ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b = s` and `a ^ b = x`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers.

Here is a correct Python implementation:
```python
def func(s, x):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    return count
```
This implementation iterates over all possible values of `a` and calculates the corresponding `b` such that `a + b = s`. It then checks if `a ^ b = x` and increments the count if the condition is satisfied.

For example, given the input `9 5`, the correct output is `4`, which corresponds to the ordered pairs `(2, 7)`, `(3, 6)`, `(6, 3)`, and `(7, 2)`.
