Correctness: **True**.

The given program seems to correctly solve the problem of finding the minimum cost of adjusting stick lengths to be almost good for some positive integer t. 

Here's why:

- The program first sorts the stick lengths, which is not strictly necessary but doesn't affect the correctness of the result.
- It then calculates the initial cost and t using the median of the stick lengths, which is a reasonable initial guess.
- The program then iterates over all possible t values (from the initial t - 1 down to 0, and from the initial t + 1 up to 100), calculating the cost for each t by summing the minimum distance between each stick length and t or t + 1.
- If it finds a t with a lower cost, it updates the minimum cost and t.

One potential issue is that the program assumes that the optimal t will always be an integer within the range [1, 100]. However, the problem description does not rule out t being an integer outside of this range. 

But, given the constraint of the problem that the stick lengths range from 1 to 100, the optimal t should indeed be an integer within this range, because changing a stick to a length outside of this range would always be more expensive than changing it to a length within this range.

Therefore, the program should work correctly for all possible inputs. 

However, it's worth noting that the program's time complexity could be improved. Currently, it has a time complexity of O(n * t), where n is the number of sticks and t is the range of possible t values. This is because it calculates the cost for each t value separately. A more efficient algorithm would be to sort the stick lengths and then use a single pass to calculate the cost for all t values, which would have a time complexity of O(n log n + n). But this does not affect the correctness of the program.
