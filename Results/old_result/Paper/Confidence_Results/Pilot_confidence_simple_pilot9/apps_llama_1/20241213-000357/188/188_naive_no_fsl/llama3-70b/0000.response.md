Correctness: **True**

The program provided appears to be correct based on the problem description. It first reads the number of cards, `n`, and then the values of the cards. It stores these values in a list `a`. Then, it creates a dictionary `d` where the keys are the unique card values and the values are the counts of each card value.

The program then iterates over the dictionary to find two card values that each appear exactly `n // 2` times (i.e., half the total number of cards). If it finds two such values, it prints "YES" and the two values. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This solution correctly addresses the problem description's requirements:

- It checks if there are two distinct numbers that each occur exactly `n // 2` times, ensuring the game can be fair.
- If no such pair exists, it correctly determines that a fair game is impossible.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, including when `n` is even (as guaranteed by the problem statement) and when the input numbers are distinct or the same.

The examples provided in the problem statement also support the correctness of the program. For instance, in the first example where the input is `4` followed by `11, 27, 27, 11`, the program correctly outputs `YES` and `11 27`, indicating that Petya and Vasya can choose these numbers to make the game fair.

In cases where a fair game is impossible, such as when all cards have the same number (second example) or when no two numbers each occur exactly `n // 2` times (third and fourth examples), the program correctly outputs "NO".

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described, handling both the successful cases where a fair game is possible and the unsuccessful cases where it is not.
