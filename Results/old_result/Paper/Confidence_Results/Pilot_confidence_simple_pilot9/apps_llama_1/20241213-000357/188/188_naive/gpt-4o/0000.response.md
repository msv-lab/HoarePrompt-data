Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the case where there are more than two unique numbers and two of them have the same count which is equal to n/2. In this case, the program should print "YES" with the two numbers that have the count equal to n/2, but the current implementation only checks if the two numbers with the highest and second-highest counts have the count equal to n/2.

A counterexample is:

Input:
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

In this case, the program prints "NO" because it only checks the numbers with the highest and second-highest counts. However, the game can be fair if Petya chooses number 1 and Vasya chooses number 2, or if Petya chooses number 1 and Vasya chooses number 3, or if Petya chooses number 2 and Vasya chooses number 3.

To fix this, the program should check all pairs of unique numbers and print "YES" with the pair that has the count equal to n/2. 

Here's how the corrected code could look like:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        for i in range(len(unique_numbers)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(unique_numbers)):
                if count[unique_numbers[i]] == n//2 and count[unique_numbers[j]] == n//2:
                    print('YES')
                    print(unique_numbers[i], unique_numbers[j])
                    return
        print('NO')
```
