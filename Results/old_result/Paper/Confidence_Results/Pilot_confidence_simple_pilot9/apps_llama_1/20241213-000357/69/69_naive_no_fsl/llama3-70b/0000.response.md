Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in the way it calculates the minimum length of the changed subsegment. The current implementation simply counts the number of operations that do not move the robot in the correct direction, which is not equivalent to finding the minimum length of the changed subsegment.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
RRRRR
3 0
```
The code will output `0` because the operations `RRRRR` already move the robot to a cell with x-coordinate `3`. However, this is not the correct answer because the robot needs to end up at `(3, 0)`, but the given sequence of operations will move it to `(5, 0)`. The correct answer should be `2` because we need to change the last two `R` operations to `L` operations to get the desired result.

This example shows that the code does not correctly handle cases where the given sequence of operations does not move the robot to the desired cell. The code needs to be revised to correctly calculate the minimum length of the changed subsegment.

Here's a correct approach to solve this problem:

We need to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed so that the robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(x, y)`. We can use a brute force approach to try all possible subsegments and check if changing that subsegment results in the robot moving to `(x, y)`.

Here is a correct Python solution:

```python
def min_length(n, ops, x, y):
    def check(subsegment):
        new_ops = list(ops)
        ux, uy = 0, 0
        for i in range(subsegment[0], subsegment[1]+1):
            if x > ux:
                new_ops[i] = 'R'
            elif x < ux:
                new_ops[i] = 'L'
            if y > uy:
                new_ops[i] = 'U'
            elif y < uy:
                new_ops[i] = 'D'
            if new_ops[i] == 'U':
                uy += 1
            elif new_ops[i] == 'D':
                uy -= 1
            elif new_ops[i] == 'R':
                ux += 1
            elif new_ops[i] == 'L':
                ux -= 1
        ux, uy = 0, 0
        for op in new_ops:
            if op == 'U':
                uy += 1
            elif op == 'D':
                uy -= 1
            elif op == 'R':
                ux += 1
            elif op == 'L':
                ux -= 1
        return (ux, uy) == (x, y)

    min_len = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if check((i, j)):
                min_len = min(min_len, j - i + 1)
    if min_len == float('inf'):
        return -1
    return min_len

n = int(input())
ops = input()
x, y = map(int, input().split())
print(min_length(n, ops, x, y))
```
This solution tries all possible subsegments of the given sequence of operations and checks if changing that subsegment results in the robot moving to `(x, y)`. If it finds a subsegment that works, it updates the minimum length. If it doesn't find any working subsegments, it returns `-1`.

This solution guarantees the correct answer but may be slow for large inputs due to its brute force nature. A more efficient solution would involve using dynamic programming or other optimization techniques.
