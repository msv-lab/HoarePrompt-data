Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether the records of the number of stones in piles can be consistent based on the problem description. It checks if the total number of stones in the second record is greater than the total number of stones in the first record. If it is, the program prints "No" because it is impossible for the jury members to move and take stones to convert the first array into the second array. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" because it is possible for the jury members to move and take stones to achieve the second array.

The key insight here is that the total number of stones cannot increase, as the jury members can only move or take stones, not add them. Therefore, if the total number of stones in the second record is greater than the total number of stones in the first record, it is impossible for the jury members to achieve the second array.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, and the examples provided in the problem description demonstrate its correctness. For instance, in the first example, the total number of stones remains the same, and the program correctly prints "Yes". In the second example, the total number of stones decreases, and the program correctly prints "Yes". In the third example, the total number of stones increases, and the program correctly prints "No".

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
