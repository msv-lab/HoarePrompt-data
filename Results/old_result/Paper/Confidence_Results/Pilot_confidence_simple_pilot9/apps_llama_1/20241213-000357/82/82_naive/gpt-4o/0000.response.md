Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not cover all possible cases and is missing some logic. The issue lies in the fact that the code only checks divisors of the difference between the two input numbers `a` and `b` to find the smallest `k`. However, the optimal `k` might not be a divisor of the difference between `a` and `b`. 

For example, consider the case where `a = 8` and `b = 9`. In this case, the optimal `k` is `1` because `lcm(9, 10) = 90` is smaller than `lcm(8, 9) = 72`. However, `1` is not a divisor of the difference `1`, so the code will not find this optimal solution. 

The code should also check for all possible values of `k`, not just the divisors of the difference between `a` and `b`. 

Here's a counterexample where the code does not work as expected:

Input: `8 9`

Expected output: `1`

Actual output: `0`

This is because the code does not check for all possible values of `k`, only the divisors of the difference between `a` and `b`. In this case, the optimal `k` is `1`, which is not a divisor of the difference `1`. 

To fix this, we need to modify the code to check for all possible values of `k`, not just the divisors of the difference between `a` and `b`. We should also keep track of the minimum `lcm` and update `min_k` accordingly. 

Here is a basic idea of how to fix it:

```python
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)

def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(diff + 1):
        new_a = a + k
        new_b = b + k
        current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
        if current_lcm < min_lcm:
            min_lcm = current_lcm
            min_k = k
    return min_k

a = 8
b = 9
print(func_3(a, b))
```
