Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for negative angles. When the input is a negative angle, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

For example, if the input is -60, the program calculates the normalized angle as -60 % 360 = 300. Then, it calculates the turns as (360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 1, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 3.

To fix this issue, the program should handle negative angles correctly. One way to do this is to add 360 to the angle if it is negative, and then calculate the normalized angle and the turns.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = (x + 360) % 360 if x < 0 else x % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)
```
Alternatively, you could use the following code:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    turns = (90 - normalized_angle) % 360
    turns = turns // 90 % 4
    if normalized_angle > 270:
        turns = 4 - turns
    print(turns)
```
This code calculates the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum, regardless of whether the input angle is positive or negative.
