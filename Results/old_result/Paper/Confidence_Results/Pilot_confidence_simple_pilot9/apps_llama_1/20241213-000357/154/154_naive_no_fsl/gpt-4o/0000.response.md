Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The main issue is that the program does not consider the optimal order in which to solve the subtasks.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 2 6
3 4
```
The program will calculate the total time per task as 7, and since the total time available is 6, it will not attempt to solve any complete tasks. Then, it will try to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time, but it will only consider solving the first subtask (with time 3), leaving 3 units of time remaining, which is not enough to solve the second subtask (with time 4). Therefore, the program will incorrectly output 1.

However, the correct solution is to solve the second subtask (with time 4) and then solve the first subtask (with time 3 - 1 = 2 and still have 1 unit of time remaining, but we can solve only one subtask of one task at a time), which is not possible, but the optimal solution is to solve one subtask of one task with time 3.

To fix this issue, the program should sort the subtasks by their times and then try to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time, considering the order of the subtasks. This way, the program can find the optimal solution for all potential cases.

A correct approach would be to use dynamic programming to consider all possible combinations of complete tasks and subtasks, taking into account the optimal order in which to solve the subtasks. 

Here is an example of correct code for this problem:
```python
import sys

def max_points(n, k, M, t):
    t.sort()
    dp = [0] * (M + 1)
    for task in range(n):
        for time in range(M, -1, -1):
            for subtask in range(k):
                if time >= t[subtask]:
                    dp[time] = max(dp[time], dp[time - t[subtask]] + 1)
                if time >= sum(t[:k]):
                    dp[time] = max(dp[time], dp[time - sum(t[:k])] + k + 1)
    return dp[M]

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = max_points(n, k, M, t)
print(result)
```
