Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The main issue lies in the `func_2` and `func_3` functions. In `func_2`, the function is supposed to calculate the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready, given the coordinates of the heat source. However, it currently uses the coordinates of the piece of meat itself as the heat source coordinates, instead of using the given heat source coordinates.

Another issue is that the program only checks heat source coordinates over the integer range from -1000 to 1000, but the problem statement allows for real number coordinates. This can lead to incorrect results if the optimal heat source location has non-integer coordinates.

For example, consider a scenario with two pieces of meat located at (-1, 0) and (1, 0) with hardness 1. The optimal heat source location would be at (0, 0), but since this is not an integer coordinate in the x or y direction, the program would not consider it, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the times for each piece of meat and to consider all possible real number coordinates for the heat source, not just integer coordinates. 

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
2 2
-1 0 1
1 0 1

In this case, the optimal heat source location is at (0, 0), but the program may not find this location because it only checks integer coordinates. As a result, the program may return an incorrect answer. 

This is just one example, and there are likely many other cases where the program does not work correctly. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
