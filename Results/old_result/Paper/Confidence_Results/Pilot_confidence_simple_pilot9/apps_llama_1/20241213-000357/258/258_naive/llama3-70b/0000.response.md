Correctness: **False**.

The reason for this is that the program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks to find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if the heat source is placed to minimize this time. The program, however, only checks for integer coordinates of the heat source and does not consider all possible real numbers as stated in the problem description.

In the `func_3` function, the program only loops through integer values of x and y from -1000 to 1000, instead of considering all real numbers. This means that the program may not find the optimal placement of the heat source, especially if the optimal placement is at a non-integer coordinate.

For example, if the optimal placement of the heat source is at (0.5, 0.5), the program will not consider this placement and may return a suboptimal solution.

Another issue with the program is that the `func_2` function is not used correctly. The function takes four arguments (x, y, X, Y), but when it is called in `func_3`, it is only passed two arguments (x, y). The function should be modified to correctly calculate the times for each piece of meat.

Finally, the `func_1` function is not used at all in the program, which is unnecessary. 

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the problem description and may not find the optimal placement of the heat source, especially for non-integer coordinates.
