Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It incorrectly handles cases where the heat source should be placed at a position that is not the midpoint of the line segment connecting two pieces of meat. 

The problem description states that the heat source can be placed at any point (X, Y) on the 2D plane, but the program only considers placing the heat source at the midpoints of the line segments connecting pairs of pieces of meat. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the optimal position of the heat source is not at the midpoint of any line segment connecting two pieces of meat, but rather at a position that is equidistant from three or more pieces of meat. 

The program's `func_1` function only checks positions that are midpoints of line segments connecting pairs of pieces of meat, and does not consider other possible positions. This means that the program may not find the optimal position of the heat source in all cases, and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

For example, if there are three pieces of meat at positions (0, 0), (1, 0), and (0.5, 0.5) with hardness 1, and we want to eat at least two pieces, the program will not find the optimal position of the heat source, which is at position (0.5, 0.25), but rather will return a suboptimal solution.
