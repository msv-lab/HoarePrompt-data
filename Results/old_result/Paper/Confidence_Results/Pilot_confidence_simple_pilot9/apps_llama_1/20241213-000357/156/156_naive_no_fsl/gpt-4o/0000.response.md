Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to accurately implement the logic described in the problem. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The function `func_1(n, m, k)` first checks if `k` is less than `n - 1`. If it is, that means Lara has not yet completed her initial descent down the leftmost column of the matrix. In this case, the program correctly prints the row as `k + 1` and the column as `1`.

2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, that means Lara has already completed her initial descent and has started moving in the snake-like pattern. The program calculates the number of full rows that Lara has traversed (`full_rows`) and the remaining steps in the current row (`remaining_steps`).

3. Depending on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, the program determines the current row and column. If `full_rows` is even, Lara is moving to the right, so the column is `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, Lara is moving to the left, so the column is `m - remaining_steps`.

The program seems to correctly handle all cases as described in the problem, including edge cases such as when `k` is `0` (Lara is at the starting position) and when `k` is equal to `n * m - 1` (Lara is at the final position). 

The examples provided also support the correctness of the program. For instance, for the input `4 3 0`, the program correctly prints `1 1`, which is the starting position. For the input `4 3 11`, the program correctly prints `1 2`, which is the final position. For the input `4 3 7`, the program correctly prints `3 2`, which matches the expected output.

Therefore, based on the provided examples and the logic implemented in the program, it appears that the program is correct.
