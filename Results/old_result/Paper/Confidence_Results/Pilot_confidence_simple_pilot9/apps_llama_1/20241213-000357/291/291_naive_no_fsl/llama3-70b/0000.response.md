Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia needs to draw with a ruler without a guide. The logic behind the program is based on the observation that the number of squares that Sofia can draw with a given number of segments is related to the bit length of the number of squares.

The formula used in the program, `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`, can be explained as follows: 

* `n.bit_length()` gives the number of bits required to represent the number `n` in binary. 
* For a given number of bits `b`, the maximum number of squares that can be drawn is `2^b - 1`. 
* To draw these squares, we need to draw `2 * (b - 1) + 2` segments: `2 * (b - 1)` segments for the vertical and horizontal lines of the inner squares, and 2 segments for the outer square.
* By subtracting 1 from `n.bit_length()`, we are effectively considering the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, which is the number of squares that can be drawn with the minimum number of segments.

Since the program uses this formula to calculate the minimum number of segments, it seems to correctly follow the problem description. The provided examples also confirm this, as the program correctly outputs the expected results for the inputs 1, 2, and 4. 

Without any counterexamples or edge cases that the program does not handle correctly, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
