Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations. 

Here is why:

- The program takes as input the number of operations and a string representing the sequence of operations.
- It counts the number of '+' and '-' operations in the string.
- If the number of '-' operations is greater than the number of '+' operations, it means that Vasya has taken more stones than he has added. In this case, the minimum number of stones that can be in the pile is 0, because Vasya can initially have a number of stones equal to the number of '-' operations, and then after the operations, the number of stones will be 0.
- If the number of '-' operations is not greater than the number of '+' operations, it means that Vasya has added at least as many stones as he has taken. In this case, the minimum number of stones that can be in the pile is the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations, because Vasya can initially have 0 stones, add the '+' stones, and then take the '-' stones.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the number of operations is 1 or where the number of '+' and '-' operations is equal. 

Therefore, the program is correct.
