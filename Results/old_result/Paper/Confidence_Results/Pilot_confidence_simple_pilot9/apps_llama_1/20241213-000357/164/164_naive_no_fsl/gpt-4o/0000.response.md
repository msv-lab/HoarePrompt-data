Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for the case when the grasshopper's jump length is more than 1 and the target insect is not reachable by jumping to the right. The program only checks if the target insect is reachable by jumping to the right, but it does not check if the target insect is reachable by jumping to the left.

For example, if the input is:
```
6 2
T..#..G
```
The program will print "NO" because it only checks if the target insect is reachable by jumping to the right from the grasshopper's position, but it does not check if the target insect is reachable by jumping to the left.

The correct implementation should check if the target insect is reachable by jumping in both directions, not just one. 

This can be achieved by implementing a more complex algorithm that uses a queue to keep track of the positions that the grasshopper can reach, and checks if the target insect's position is in the queue.

Here is a simple example of how this can be implemented:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited.add(G_pos)
    
    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print("YES")
            return
        for next_pos in [pos - k, pos + k]:
            if 0 <= next_pos < n and line[next_pos]!= '#' and next_pos not in visited:
                queue.append(next_pos)
                visited.add(next_pos)
    print("NO")
```
