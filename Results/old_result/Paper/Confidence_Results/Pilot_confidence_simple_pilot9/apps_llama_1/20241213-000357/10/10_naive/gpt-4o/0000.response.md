Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. The current implementation only checks if the cells of one sofa are to the left, right, top, or bottom of the cells of another sofa, but it does not consider the definition of a sofa being to the left, right, top, or bottom of another given in the problem description.

The problem description states that sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. The current implementation does not check this condition correctly.

For example, consider the case where there are two sofas: (1, 1, 1, 2) and (2, 1, 2, 2). The current implementation would count the second sofa as being to the right of the first sofa, because the cell (2, 1) is to the right of the cell (1, 1). However, the problem description does not consider this case, because the cell (1, 2) is also covered by the first sofa and is to the right of the cell (2, 1).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check all possible pairs of cells, one from each sofa, and count the number of sofas that satisfy the condition. Here is a correct implementation in Python:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            cells_i = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2)]
            cells_j = [(x1_j, y1_j), (x2_j, y2_j)]
            left = False
            right = False
            top = False
            bottom = False
            for cell_i in cells_i:
                for cell_j in cells_j:
                    if cell_i[0] < cell_j[0]:
                        left = True
                    if cell_i[0] > cell_j[0]:
                        right = True
                    if cell_i[1] < cell_j[1]:
                        bottom = True
                    if cell_i[1] > cell_j[1]:
                        top = True
            if left:
                left_count[i] += 1
            if right:
                right_count[i] += 1
            if top:
                top_count[i] += 1
            if bottom:
                bottom_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)
```

This implementation correctly counts the number of sofas that satisfy the condition for each sofa.
