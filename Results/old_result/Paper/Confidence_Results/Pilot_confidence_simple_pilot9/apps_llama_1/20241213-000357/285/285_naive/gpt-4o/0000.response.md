Correctness: **True**.

The provided program checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers within the given budget `n`. It iterates over the number of houses that can be bought, then for each number of houses, it checks the number of cars that can be bought with the remaining budget. Finally, it checks if the remaining budget after buying houses and cars can be spent on computers.

The program uses integer division (`//`) to calculate the maximum number of houses, cars, and computers that can be bought, ensuring that it doesn't exceed the remaining budget. It also checks if the remaining budget after buying houses and cars is a multiple of the computer cost using the modulo operator (`%`). This ensures that the program finds a valid combination of houses, cars, and computers that add up to the initial budget `n`, if such a combination exists.

The program correctly handles the given examples and it's difficult to imagine a scenario where it would not work as expected. The use of nested loops to iterate over possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers, along with the checks for remaining budget and computer cost, ensures that the program covers all possible cases.

Overall, the program is well-structured, and the logic is sound, making it correct for the given problem description.
