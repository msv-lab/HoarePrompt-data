Correctness: **True**

The given program is a solution to the described problem, where the goal is to determine if two 2x2 sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration through a sequence of moves. The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to generate all possible reachable configurations from the initial states of both puzzles.

The code defines a function `func_1` to convert the 2x2 grid into a string representation, and a function `func_2` to perform the BFS traversal. The `func_2` function uses a queue to keep track of the current configurations to be explored and a set to store the visited configurations.

The program correctly checks if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration by taking the intersection of the reachable configurations from both initial states and checking if the result is not empty.

The code is well-structured and handles all possible cases correctly. It correctly identifies the cases where the puzzles can or cannot reach the same configuration, as demonstrated in the provided examples.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
