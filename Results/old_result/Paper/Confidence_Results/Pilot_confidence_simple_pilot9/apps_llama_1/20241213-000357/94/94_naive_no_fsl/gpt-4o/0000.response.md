Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a correct implementation of a solution to the problem. 

Here is an explanation of why the code is correct in every case:

- The code reads the initial configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles correctly from the input, storing them in `bessie_puzzle` and `elsie_puzzle`.
- The `func_1` function correctly converts the 2x2 puzzle configurations into a single string, which can be used for simplicity in the rest of the program.
- The `func_2` function implements a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find all reachable configurations of the puzzle from a given starting configuration. This is done by using a queue to systematically explore all possible moves.
- The program checks if the set of reachable configurations from Bessie's puzzle intersects with the set of reachable configurations from Elsie's puzzle. If there is an intersection, it means that there exists a sequence of moves that can take both puzzles to the same configuration, and the program correctly prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
- The use of a set to keep track of visited configurations ensures that the program does not revisit the same configuration multiple times, which prevents infinite loops and improves efficiency.

After examining the code and the problem description, I was unable to find a case where the program does not work as expected. The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
