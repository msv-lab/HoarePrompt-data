Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines the result of Nauuo's comment based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. It handles all possible cases as described in the problem.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. If `x` (upvotes) is greater than `y` (downvotes) plus `z` (unknown votes), it means that even if all unknown votes are downvotes, the number of upvotes will still be more. In this case, the program correctly prints '+'.

2. If `x` is less than `y`, it means that the number of downvotes is already more than upvotes, even without considering the unknown votes. In this case, the program correctly prints '-'.

3. If `x` is equal to `y`, it means that the result depends on the unknown votes. If `z` is 0 (no unknown votes), the program correctly prints '0'. If `z` is greater than 0, the program correctly prints '?' because the result is uncertain.

4. In the `else` block, if `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`, it means that the result depends on the unknown votes. If all unknown votes are upvotes, the result will be '+'; if all or some are downvotes, the result could be '0' or '-'. In this case, the program correctly prints '?' because the result is uncertain.

The program handles all possible cases and edge cases correctly. It correctly identifies when the result is certain ('+', '-', or '0') and when it's uncertain ('?'). The provided examples in the problem description demonstrate the correctness of the program, and no counterexamples can be found.
