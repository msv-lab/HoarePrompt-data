Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the result of the votes based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible number of upvotes and downvotes by adding or subtracting the unknown votes from the known upvotes and downvotes.

2. It then checks if the maximum possible number of upvotes is less than the minimum possible number of downvotes. If so, it means that even in the best-case scenario for upvotes, the number of downvotes is still higher, so the result is '-'.

3. If the maximum possible number of downvotes is less than the minimum possible number of upvotes, it means that even in the worst-case scenario for upvotes, the number of upvotes is still higher, so the result is '+'.

4. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that the result can be uncertain because there are scenarios where the number of upvotes and downvotes can be equal or one can be greater than the other, depending on how the unknown votes are distributed. In this case, the program prints '?'.

The program handles all the examples correctly and also covers all the edge cases as described in the problem. It does not assume any specific input and can handle any combination of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes within the given range (0-100). 

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all possible input cases as described in the problem description.
