Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem of decoding the genome by replacing unrecognized nucleotides with one of the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') such that the number of nucleotides of each type becomes equal.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. It first counts the occurrence of each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input string `s`.
2. It calculates the average count of each nucleotide type by dividing the length of the string `n` by 4.
3. It then calculates the remaining count for each nucleotide type by subtracting the actual count from the average count.
4. It iterates through the input string `s` and replaces each unrecognized nucleotide ('?') with a nucleotide type that has a remaining count greater than 0.
5. If there are any remaining counts left after replacing all unrecognized nucleotides, it prints "===" indicating that it's not possible to decode the genome.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including:

* When the input string `s` is already decoded correctly.
* When the input string `s` can be decoded correctly by replacing unrecognized nucleotides.
* When it's not possible to decode the genome, such as when the length of the string `n` is not a multiple of 4.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to decode the genome according to the problem description, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
