Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description by checking if it's possible to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal. 

Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the length of the genome is a multiple of 4. If it's not, it immediately returns '===' because it's impossible to decode the genome in this case.

2. It then counts the current occurrences of each nucleotide in the genome and checks if any of the counts exceed the target count (which is the length of the genome divided by 4). If any count exceeds the target count, it immediately returns '===' because it's impossible to decode the genome in this case.

3. If the counts are valid, the program iterates over the genome and replaces each unrecognized nucleotide '?' with the first nucleotide that has a count less than the target count. This ensures that each nucleotide will have the same count in the decoded genome.

4. The program handles all possible cases correctly. For example, it correctly handles cases where the genome is already decoded (like the example 'AGCT'), cases where some nucleotides are unrecognized (like the example 'AG?C??CT'), and cases where it's impossible to decode the genome (like the examples '????G?' and 'AA??').

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases, so it's correct.
