Correctness: **True**

The program provided accurately calculates the number of spectators standing at time t, given the total number of spectators n, the number of spectators that stand up before the wave starts, k, and the time t. 

The function uses the following logic:
- If t is less than or equal to n, the number of standing spectators is the minimum of t and k. This makes sense because in the first n time units, the spectators stand up one by one, and the wave is still advancing.
- If t is greater than n, the number of standing spectators is k minus the remainder of (t - n) divided by k. This is because after time n, the wave starts to recede, and the number of standing spectators decreases at a rate of one every k time units.

This logic is consistent with the problem description, and the code handles all potential cases correctly. For example, the given examples (10 5 3, 10 5 7, and 10 5 12) all produce the correct output.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when t is equal to n or when t is a multiple of k. 

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases, and the correctness is **True**.
