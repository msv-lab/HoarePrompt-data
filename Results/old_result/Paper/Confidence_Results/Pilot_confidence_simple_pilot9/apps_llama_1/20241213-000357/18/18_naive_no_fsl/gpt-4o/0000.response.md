Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's why:

- If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is simply `t`, as the first `t` spectators are standing. This is correctly handled by the program with the condition `if t <= k: print(t)`.

- If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, all `k` spectators are standing, as the standing spectators start sitting from the first one at time `k + 1`. This is also correctly handled by the program with the condition `elif t <= n: print(k)`.

- If `t` is greater than `n`, some spectators are sitting, and the number of standing spectators is `n + k - t`. This is correctly handled by the program with the condition `else: print(n + k - t)`.

All the examples provided in the problem description match the expected output of the program, and no potential case seems to be left unhandled. Therefore, the program appears to be correct. 

It correctly calculates the number of standing spectators at time `t` based on the given conditions and handles all possible cases without leaving any edge cases unaccounted for. 

Hence, after analyzing the given examples and the code's logic, we can conclude that the given Python program is indeed correct.
