Correctness: **False**.

The given program has a bug. The issue lies in the lines where the dp array is being updated. 

The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is incorrect because it's counting the number of ways to reach `i - b` and then jump back to `i` multiple times, which is not the correct interpretation of the problem. This line should be removed because we are already considering all possible ways to reach `i` in the line `dp[i + a] += dp[i]`.

However, the line `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` is also partially correct, but it's not enough. It only considers the cases where the frog jumps to `i + a`, but it doesn't consider the cases where the frog jumps to `i - b` and then jumps to `i + a` or `i - b` again.

A correct solution would involve keeping track of all the positions that the frog can reach, and for each position, calculate the number of ways to reach it. 

Here's a possible correct solution:
```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            if i + a <= m:
                dp[i + a] += dp[i - b]
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))
```
However, the above solution still has issues. A correct solution would involve using a set to keep track of all the positions that the frog can reach, and then calculate the sum of the number of positions that the frog can reach for each `i` from 0 to `m`.

Here's a correct solution:
```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        reachable = set()
        stack = [0]
        while stack:
            pos = stack.pop()
            if pos not in reachable:
                reachable.add(pos)
                if pos + a <= i:
                    stack.append(pos + a)
                if pos - b >= 0 and pos - b <= i:
                    stack.append(pos - b)
        total_sum += len(reachable)
    print(total_sum)
```
This solution correctly calculates the sum of the number of positions that the frog can reach for each `i` from 0 to `m`. 

Note: The original program has a bug and does not produce the correct output for all test cases. The above explanation highlights the issues with the original program and provides a correct solution.
