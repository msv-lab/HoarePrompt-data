Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. 

The key to this problem is to determine the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give to Ivan so that Ivan receives at least L new coins. The program calculates this minimum number of coins per friend (`min_x`) as the ceiling of L divided by M, which ensures that the total number of new coins is at least L.

Then, it checks if it's possible for each friend to give `min_x` coins while satisfying the condition that all coins given to Ivan must be different. This is done by checking if M times `min_x` is less than or equal to the total number of coins that Ivan does not have (N - K). If this condition is satisfied, the program prints `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where M is greater than N, or where L is greater than N - K. The examples provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program. 

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
