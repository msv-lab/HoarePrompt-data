Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the `can_distribute` function. The current implementation checks if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces of cake is greater than or equal to `n`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that each plate can only contain pieces of one type of cake.

A counterexample is the input `4 7 10`. The program should return `3` according to the problem description. However, if we modify the input to `4 7 11`, the program will still return `3`, which is incorrect. The correct result for this input should be `2` or less, because it is impossible to distribute the cakes in such a way that each plate contains at least `3` pieces.

The correct approach would be to use a more complex algorithm that takes into account the fact that each plate can only contain pieces of one type of cake. A possible solution could involve iterating over all possible combinations of filling the plates with pieces of each type of cake and checking if the minimum number of pieces per plate is greater than or equal to `x`.

To fix the code, we need to reconsider the `can_distribute` function and implement a correct algorithm that checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes in such a way that each plate contains at least `x` pieces. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

def can_distribute(x):
    for i in range(x, a + 1):
        if a >= i * x and b >= (n - (a // i)) * x:
            return True
        if b >= i * x and a >= (n - (b // i)) * x:
            return True
    return False
```
Note that the `can_distribute` function now checks all possible combinations of filling the plates with pieces of each type of cake and returns `True` if it finds a combination where each plate contains at least `x` pieces. If it does not find such a combination, it returns `False`.
