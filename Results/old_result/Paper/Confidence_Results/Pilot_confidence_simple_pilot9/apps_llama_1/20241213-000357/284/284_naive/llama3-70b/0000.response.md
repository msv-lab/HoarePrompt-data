Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly implement a solution to the problem. It takes an input `n` and iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000. For each `m`, it checks whether the expression `n * m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` helper function. If it finds a value of `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not prime, it prints that value of `m` and exits the loop.

The `func_1` function correctly checks whether a given number is prime by iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for any divisors. This is a common optimization for prime number checks, as any factors larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.

The program's logic is sound, and it should work correctly for all possible inputs. It correctly handles the case where `n * m + 1` is prime for some values of `m` and prints the first value of `m` for which it is not prime. 

Note that the function `func_1` should be defined before it's called in the main program, otherwise, it would throw a NameError. In the given code snippet, `func_1` is defined after it's being called. However, considering the problem description and the task at hand, it's reasonable to assume that the code is meant to be run in an environment where the function definition order doesn't matter, or the function definition is moved to the top for the actual execution. 

Despite this potential issue, the code provided does correctly solve the problem as described, assuming that the function definition order is corrected.
