Correctness: **True**.

I have analyzed the given Python program, which is designed to determine the number of years it will take for Limak to become strictly heavier than his brother Bob, given their initial weights and the rates at which their weights increase (Limak's weight triples every year, while Bob's weight doubles). The program uses a simple while loop to simulate the passage of years, multiplying Limak's weight by 3 and Bob's weight by 2 in each iteration, until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, as it:

1. Reads the initial weights `a` and `b` from the input.
2. Initializes a variable `years` to keep track of the number of years passed.
3. Enters a loop that continues as long as `a` (Limak's weight) is less than or equal to `b` (Bob's weight).
4. Inside the loop, it multiplies `a` by 3 and `b` by 2, simulating the weight increase for both Limak and Bob, and increments the `years` counter.
5. Once the loop exits (i.e., when `a` exceeds `b`), it prints the number of years that have passed.

All the provided examples are correctly handled by the program, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and will produce the desired output for any valid input.
