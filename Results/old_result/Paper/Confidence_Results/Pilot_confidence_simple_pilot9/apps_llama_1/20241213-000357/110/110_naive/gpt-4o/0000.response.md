Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to be correct based on the provided problem description. The program uses a greedy approach to place the fish in the cells that have the maximum coverage by the scoop-net. It calculates the coverage of each cell using the `coverage` function and uses a heap to keep track of the cells with the maximum coverage.

The `coverage` function calculates the number of possible positions of the scoop-net where the cell can be covered. This is done by calculating the number of possible positions of the scoop-net that can cover the cell in the x and y directions, respectively.

The program then pops the cells with the maximum coverage from the heap and adds the coverage of these cells to the total coverage.

Finally, the program calculates the expected value of the number of caught fish by dividing the total coverage by the total number of possible positions of the scoop-net.

The program seems to be correct because it:

* Calculates the coverage of each cell correctly
* Uses a greedy approach to place the fish in the cells with the maximum coverage
* Calculates the expected value of the number of caught fish correctly

The program also passes the provided examples, which suggests that it is working correctly. However, without a formal proof or additional testing, it is impossible to be 100% certain that the program is correct for all possible inputs. But based on the provided information, it seems to be correct.

Note that the program uses a greedy approach, which may not always lead to the optimal solution. However, in this case, the greedy approach seems to be correct because the problem has the property that the optimal solution can be obtained by placing the fish in the cells with the maximum coverage. 

One of the key reasons why the program seems correct is that it treats each cell independently and greedily chooses the cells with the highest coverage. In this particular problem, this approach works because the optimal placement of the fish can be achieved by placing them in the cells with the highest coverage. 

If there were a case where this greedy approach did not work (for example, if the coverage of a cell depended on the placement of fish in other cells), then the program would likely be incorrect. However, based on the problem description, this does not seem to be the case. 

Therefore, based on the provided information, the program seems to be correct.
