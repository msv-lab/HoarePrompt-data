Correctness: **True**

The given Python program accurately implements the golden system and compares the decimal values of two numbers in this system. The key to the program is the function `func_1(s)`, which correctly calculates the decimal value of a number represented as a string `s` in the golden system.

The golden system is defined such that the decimal value of a number `a_0a_1...a_{n}` is given by the sum of `a_i * q^(n-i)`, where `q = (sqrt(5) + 1)/2`. The function `func_1(s)` iterates over each character in the string `s`, and if the character is '1', it adds the corresponding value of `q` raised to the power of the position (counting from the right, starting at 0) to the total value.

The comparison of the two input numbers is straightforward: the program calculates the decimal values of both numbers using `func_1(s)` and then prints '>' if the first number is larger, '<' if the second number is larger, and '=' if they are equal.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the input numbers have different lengths. The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the decimal value of each number, regardless of its length, by taking into account the position of each digit in the number.

I couldn't find any example where the program doesn't work as expected according to the problem description. The provided examples are also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
