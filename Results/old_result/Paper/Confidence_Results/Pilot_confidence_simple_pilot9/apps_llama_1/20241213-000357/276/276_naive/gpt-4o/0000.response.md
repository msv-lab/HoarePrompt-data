Correctness: **True**

The given program accurately implements the required functionality to compare two numbers in the golden system notation. Here's a breakdown of why the code works correctly:

1.  **Input and Output Handling**: The code correctly reads two lines as input and stores them in `s1` and `s2`. It then calls the `func_1` function to calculate the decimal values of these numbers and prints the comparison result based on these values.

2.  **Decimal Value Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system notation. It defines `q` as `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`, which is the base of the golden system. It then iterates over the digits of the input string, adding `q` raised to the power of `(n - i - 1)` to the total value whenever it encounters a '1'. This formula exactly matches the problem description.

3.  **Comparison Logic**: The comparison logic is straightforward and follows the problem requirements. If `value1` (the decimal value of the first number) is greater than `value2` (the decimal value of the second number), it prints '>'. If `value1` is less than `value2`, it prints '<'. Otherwise, it prints '='.

To test the correctness of the code, let's consider some edge cases:

*   **Empty Strings**: Although the problem statement mentions that the input strings are non-empty, the code does not explicitly handle empty strings. However, in Python, the `input().strip()` function returns an empty string if the user enters nothing and presses Enter. The code does not crash or produce incorrect results when given empty strings but does not handle this case explicitly, which is acceptable since the problem statement guarantees non-empty input.
*   **Strings with Only '0's**: The code correctly handles strings containing only '0's by returning a decimal value of 0 for such strings.
*   **Strings with Only '1's**: The code also correctly handles strings containing only '1's by calculating their decimal values according to the golden system notation.
*   **Strings with Different Lengths**: The code can handle strings of different lengths. It calculates the decimal value of each number based on its actual length and the position of '1's in the string.

Overall, the given program accurately implements the required functionality and handles various edge cases correctly, making it a correct solution to the problem.
