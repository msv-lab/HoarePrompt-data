Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks pairs of shovels where one shovel's cost is `i` and the other shovel's cost is `n - i`, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to find all pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

For example, if `n = 10`, the maximum possible number of nines at the end is 1, and the pairs of shovels that satisfy this condition are `(1, 8)`, `(2, 7)`, `(3, 6)`, `(4, 5)`, `(5, 4)`, `(6, 3)`, `(7, 2)`, `(8, 1)`. However, the given program does not correctly identify these pairs.

The program also has a bug in the condition `if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:`. This condition is not correct because it checks if the sum of the costs of the two shovels is divisible by `10` raised to the power of the number of digits in the sum minus 1, which is not the correct condition to check.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all pairs of shovels and check if their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. We also need to keep track of the maximum number of nines seen so far and update it as we iterate over the pairs. 

Here is a correct version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    max_nines_count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total_cost = i + j
            nines = 0
            while total_cost % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                total_cost //= 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                max_nines_count = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                max_nines_count += 1
    print(max_nines_count)

func()
```
This program correctly identifies all pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines and prints the count of such pairs.
