Correctness: **False**.

The given program is trying to find the maximum number of nines at the end of the sum of two shovel costs and then calculate the number of pairs of shovels that achieve this maximum. However, the approach is incorrect.

The issue with the program is that it is only considering the case where the maximum number of nines at the end is determined by the number of factors of 10 in `n + 1`. It does not consider the actual costs of the shovels and how their sums can end with nines.

For example, consider the case where `n = 10`. The program will calculate `max_9s` as 1 and then print `pairs` as 1. However, the correct answer should be 5, because the pairs (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), and (5, 5) all have sums that end with 1 nine.

The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible pairs of shovels and checking how many nines their sums end with, and then finding the maximum number of nines achieved by any pair and counting the number of pairs that achieve this maximum. 

Here is a simple example of how this could be done:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    max_count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1):
            sum_of_costs = i + j
            num_9s = 0
            while sum_of_costs % 10 == 9:
                num_9s += 1
                sum_of_costs //= 10
            if num_9s > max_9s:
                max_9s = num_9s
                max_count = 1
            elif num_9s == max_9s:
                max_count += 1
    print(max_count)

# However, please note that this approach can be optimized further for larger inputs.
