Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three input numbers and checks if it is divisible by each of them.

The program uses the formula `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))`, which is incorrect. This formula does not accurately calculate the LCM of three numbers.

Moreover, the condition `if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0)` is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible combinations of switching times and verifying if there is at least one garland lit during each second after switching.

A counterexample where the program fails is:

Input: 2 3 5

Output: YES (by the given program), but the correct output should be NO. This is because no matter when you start the garlands, there will always be a time when none of them will be lit. For example, if you start them at time 1, the first garland will be lit at times 1, 3, 5, 7,..., the second at times 1, 4, 7, 10,..., and the third at times 1, 6, 11, 16,.... There will be a gap between the 5th and 6th seconds when none of the garlands will be lit. 

This example shows that the program does not work correctly for all inputs, and hence its correctness is **False**.
