Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not accurately solve the problem of finding the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. However, the provided code simply counts the number of divisors of `n`, which does not directly relate to the concept of split weights.

A counterexample can be seen with the input `n = 4`. The possible splits of `4` are `[4]`, `[3, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, `[2, 1, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, with corresponding weights of `1`, `1`, `2`, `1`, and `4`, respectively. The unique weights are `1`, `2`, and `4`, resulting in `3` different weights. However, the provided code will return the count of divisors of `4`, which is `3` (corresponding to divisors `1`, `2`, and `4`), not the correct count of unique weights. 

To correctly solve this problem, the code would need to generate all possible splits of `n`, calculate the weight of each split, and then count the unique weights. The provided code does not perform these steps, resulting in an incorrect solution. 

This issue is evident upon examining the code and its logic, which does not align with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect for this task.
