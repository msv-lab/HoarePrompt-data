Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to correctly implement the task described in the problem. The function `func_1(n)` iterates over all possible pairs of sides of a rectangle that can be formed using the four parts of the stick, with lengths `a` and `b`. It checks if the sum of the lengths of these two pairs equals the total length of the stick (`2 * (a + b) == n`), and if the lengths are not equal (`a!= b`), which ensures that a square cannot be formed.

This approach covers all possible cases, as any rectangle can be split into two pairs of equal-length sides, and any square can be split into four equal-length sides. The condition `a!= b` ensures that only rectangles, not squares, are counted.

For example, when `n = 6`, the program correctly returns `1`, because the only way to divide the stick is into lengths `{1, 1, 2, 2}`.

Similarly, when `n = 20`, the program correctly returns `4`, because there are four ways to divide the stick: `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`.

The program also handles cases where `n` is odd or even, and it correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts of positive integer length.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
