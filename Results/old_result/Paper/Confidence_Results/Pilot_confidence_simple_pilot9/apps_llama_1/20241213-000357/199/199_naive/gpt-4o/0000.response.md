Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly counts the number of ways to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 

The function `func_1(n)` iterates over all possible values for `a` and sets `b` equal to `a`. It then calculates `rem` which is the remaining length after removing `2 * (a + b)` from `n`. If `rem` is positive and even, it means that we can form two more equal parts with length `rem // 2`. The program also checks if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, because if they are equal, it would be possible to form a square.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- It checks all possible values for `a` and `b`.
- It correctly calculates `rem` and checks if it is positive and even.
- It checks if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2` to ensure that a rectangle but not a square can be formed.

The examples provided also work correctly:

- For `n = 6`, the output is `1`, which corresponds to the division `{1, 1, 2, 2}`.
- For `n = 20`, the output is `4`, which corresponds to the divisions `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
