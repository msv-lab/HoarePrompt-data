Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It only considers the case where two pairs of parts have the same length, but it does not account for the case where all four parts are of different lengths.

To form a rectangle but not a square, two pairs of parts must have different lengths. The given code only checks for pairs of equal lengths within each pair, but it doesn't consider the case when the two pairs themselves are different.

For example, if the input is 10, the output should be 2, corresponding to the partitions {1, 1, 4, 4} and {2, 2, 3, 3}. However, the provided code does not correctly handle this case.

A correct implementation would involve checking all possible combinations of four parts that sum up to the given length, and then filtering out those combinations that can form a square or do not form a rectangle. The given code does not perform this comprehensive check, so it is incorrect.
