Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b that needs to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.

The program simply increments the answer by 1 for each element in the permutation that is not in its correct position (i.e., p[i]!= i + 1) and for each element in the sequence b that is 0. However, this approach is overly simplistic and does not consider the actual requirements of the problem.

A counterexample to the program is when the permutation is a cycle (i.e., a permutation where every element is not in its correct position, but the permutation is still a valid cycle). In such cases, the program will incorrectly increment the answer by n, whereas the correct answer would be to change at least one element in the sequence b to ensure that every skewer visits each of 2n placements.

For instance, consider the input:
```
4
2 3 4 1
0 0 0 0
```
The program will output 8, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 1, because we can change any one element in the sequence b to 1, ensuring that every skewer visits each of 2n placements.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect, and a more complex approach is needed to solve this problem.
