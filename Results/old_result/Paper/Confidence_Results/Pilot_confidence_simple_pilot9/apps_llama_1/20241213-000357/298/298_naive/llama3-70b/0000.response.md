Correctness: **True**

The program is designed to find three integer points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) within the given boundaries (0 <= x <= n, 0 <= y <= m) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to (n*m)/k.

The program first checks if n*m is divisible by k. If not, it immediately prints "NO" because the required area cannot be achieved.

If n*m is divisible by k, the program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and m using the func_3 function, which is based on the extended Euclidean algorithm implemented by func_1 and func_2.

The program then checks if the absolute value of n1*m is greater than or equal to the GCD. This check ensures that the calculated coordinates for the points will be within the given boundaries and will satisfy the area requirement.

If the condition is met, the program prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points. The points are chosen such that two of them lie on the x-axis and the third point's y-coordinate is calculated to satisfy the required area.

The reason this program is correct is that it accurately implements the mathematical requirements for finding the points that satisfy the given area condition. It handles the divisibility check correctly and uses the GCD to ensure that the points can be chosen within the given boundaries. The program also correctly calculates the coordinates of the points to achieve the required area.

I could not find any example where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. The program correctly handles all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
