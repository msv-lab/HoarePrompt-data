Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not work correctly for every potential case. After analyzing the code and the problem description, it appears that the program does not handle all possible scenarios.

One potential issue lies in the way the function `func_3` is used. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m` using the extended Euclidean algorithm implemented in `func_2`. However, the main part of the program checks if `n * m % k` equals zero to determine if a triangle can be formed, which correctly checks if the area can be achieved, but the subsequent logic for determining the points of the triangle only works when `n` and `m` have certain properties regarding their GCD and the desired area `n*m/k`.

A specific case where the program does not work as expected is not immediately obvious due to the complex nature of the problem and the code's logic. However, the way the points are calculated and printed suggests that it might fail to find a valid triangle in cases where the solution exists but doesn't fit the specific pattern assumed by the code.

For instance, the code's strategy to find points `(0, 0)`, `(0, n1 * m // g)`, and `(m1 * m // g, 0)` is based on the GCD calculations and might not be applicable in all scenarios where a triangle can be formed to achieve the desired area. The problem description asks for any three points that form a triangle with the specified area, but the code limits itself to a specific configuration of points, which might not always be achievable or necessary to fulfill the condition.

Without a straightforward counterexample but understanding the limitations in the code's logic and its reliance on specific mathematical properties, it's clear that the program does not explore all possible configurations of points that could satisfy the condition for all inputs of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Thus, while the code is well-structured and attempts to solve the problem, its limitations and potential oversights in handling the full range of possible inputs and geometric configurations mean it cannot be considered correct for every potential case as described in the problem.
