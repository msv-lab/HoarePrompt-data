Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all the cases as per the problem description. It only considers two cases: 
1. When the total sum of the array is not zero, it prints the entire array as one subarray.
2. When the total sum is zero, it tries to split the array into two subarrays, the first one ending at the index of the first non-zero element.

However, this approach does not cover all possible cases. For example, if the array has multiple non-zero elements and the sum of some prefix of the array is not zero, the program should be able to split the array into multiple subarrays, each with a non-zero sum.

A counterexample is the input:
```
5
1 -1 2 -2 3
```
The program will not be able to correctly split this array into subarrays with non-zero sums. 

In this case, the correct output should be:
```
YES
3
1 1
2 2
3 5
```
But the given program will not be able to produce this output. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
