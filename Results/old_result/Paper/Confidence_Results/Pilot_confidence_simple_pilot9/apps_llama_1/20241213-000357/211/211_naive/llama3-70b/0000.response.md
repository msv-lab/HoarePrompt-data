Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For instance, consider the input:

```
4
1 2 3 -6
```

In this case, the program outputs:

```
YES
1 1 1
2 1 4
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
YES
1
1 3
4 4
```

Or 

```
YES
1
1 4
```
can be one of the possible correct answers as well.

The program fails to correctly identify the subarrays with non-zero sums and instead tries to print the number of subarrays `k` along with the subarray indices, which is not in line with the problem description. The problem requires the number of subarrays to be printed on a separate line, followed by the subarray indices on separate lines.

Another issue with the code is that it does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the entire array is non-zero but the sum of some prefixes is zero. In such cases, the code may not correctly identify the subarrays with non-zero sums.

In general, the code has several logical errors and does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, its correctness is **False**.
