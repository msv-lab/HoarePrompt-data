Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The program initializes the current latitude to 90 degrees (the North Pole) and then iterates over the given instructions. For each instruction, it updates the current latitude based on the direction and distance traveled.

The program checks three conditions:

1. If Limak is at the North Pole (latitude 90), he can only move south.
2. If Limak is at the South Pole (latitude -90), he can only move north.
3. The journey must end at the North Pole (latitude 90).

The program correctly handles these conditions by checking the current latitude and direction after each instruction. If any of the conditions are not met, it prints "NO" and exits. If the journey ends at the North Pole, it prints "YES".

The program also handles the case where Limak travels east or west, which does not change his latitude. In such cases, the program simply continues to the next instruction without updating the latitude.

All the provided example inputs seem to be correctly handled by the program, and there are no obvious cases where the program would not work as expected. The conversion factor of 111.195 kilometers per degree is also correct, as it is approximately the distance between two points on the Earth's surface that are one degree apart at the equator.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and should work correctly for all possible inputs.
