Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct because it properly calculates the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations. The program sorts the input array in ascending order, then iterates through the sorted array, maintaining a variable `mex` that represents the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in the array. For each number in the array, if the number is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1. This process continues until the end of the array is reached, at which point `mex` represents the maximum possible value of mex of the array.

The program's logic is sound because it takes advantage of the fact that the mex of an array is the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in the array. By iteratively checking each number in the sorted array against the current `mex`, the program effectively determines the maximum possible value of mex by ensuring that each number in the sorted array is either equal to or greater than the current `mex`. This approach guarantees that the resulting `mex` value is the maximum possible, as it takes into account the possibility of decreasing each number in the array to a smaller positive integer.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where the input array contains duplicate numbers or numbers that are already in the correct order. It also correctly handles the case where the input array contains only one number, as the `sort` method and the subsequent iteration through the array will still produce the correct result.

In summary, the program's logic and implementation are correct, and it handles all possible cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
