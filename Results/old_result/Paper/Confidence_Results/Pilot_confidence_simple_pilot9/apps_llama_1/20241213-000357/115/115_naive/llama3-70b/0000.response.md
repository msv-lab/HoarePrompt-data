Correctness: **False**.

The code attempts to generate operations to make matrix B equal to matrix A by iterating over all possible 2x2 submatrices and checking if any of the elements in the submatrix are 1. If any element is 1, it adds the operation to set the entire submatrix to 1 to the list of operations.

However, this approach does not work correctly for all cases because it does not consider the case where a single operation can set multiple elements to 1. For example, if the input matrix A is:

```
1 1
1 1
```

The code will generate two operations:

```
1 1
2 1
```

Which is incorrect because it is possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A with just one operation:

```
1 1
```

Another example where the code fails is when there are single 1's in the matrix that cannot be part of a 2x2 submatrix. In this case, the code will not generate any operations, and matrix B will not be equal to matrix A.

For instance, if the input matrix A is:

```
1 0
0 0
```

The code will not generate any operations, and matrix B will remain as:

```
0 0
0 0
```

Which is not equal to matrix A.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not work for all potential cases.
