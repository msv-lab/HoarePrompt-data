Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input string is "BBB", the program should output 1 because the grasshopper can jump over the string by jumping 1 character at a time. However, the program outputs 0 which is incorrect.

Another issue with the program is that it calculates the maximum jump ability as the maximum of `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` for all vowels `i`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the grasshopper can always jump to the middle point between the current vowel and the last vowel. However, this is not always the case.

The correct approach is to calculate the maximum jump ability as the maximum of `i - last_vowel` for all vowels `i`, and also consider the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.

Here is a correct version of the program:
```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel!= -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i - last_vowel)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel!= -1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, n - last_vowel)
    else:
        max_jump = n
    print(max_jump)
```
