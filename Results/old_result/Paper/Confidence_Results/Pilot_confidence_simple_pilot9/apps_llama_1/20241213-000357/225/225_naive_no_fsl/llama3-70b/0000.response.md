Correctness: **False**

The program is not working correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in how the `max_jump` is being calculated. The current program is trying to calculate the minimum jump ability by taking the maximum of the current `max_jump` and the distance between the current vowel and the previous vowel divided by 2 plus 1. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility that the grasshopper may need to jump over non-vowel characters to reach the next vowel.

A correct approach would be to calculate the minimum jump ability by considering the maximum distance between two consecutive vowels in the string. This can be achieved by iterating over the string and keeping track of the positions of the vowels. Then, calculate the distance between each pair of consecutive vowels and keep track of the maximum distance found.

Here is an example of how the program can fail:

Input:
AAAEAAAA

The expected output is 1, but the program may output a value greater than 1. This is because the program is calculating the distance between the vowels incorrectly. 

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the minimum jump ability. One possible solution is to use a loop to iterate over the string and keep track of the positions of the vowels. Then, calculate the distance between each pair of consecutive vowels and keep track of the maximum distance found.

Here's an example of a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    positions = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c in vowels]
    max_jump = 1
    if positions:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, positions[0] + 1)
        for i in range(1, len(positions)):
            max_jump = max(max_jump, positions[i] - positions[i-1])
        max_jump = max(max_jump, n - positions[-1])
    else:
        max_jump = n
    print(max_jump)
```

This corrected version of the function first finds the positions of all vowels in the string. Then, it calculates the maximum distance between each pair of consecutive vowels and keeps track of the maximum distance found. Finally, it prints the maximum distance found, which is the minimum jump ability required.
