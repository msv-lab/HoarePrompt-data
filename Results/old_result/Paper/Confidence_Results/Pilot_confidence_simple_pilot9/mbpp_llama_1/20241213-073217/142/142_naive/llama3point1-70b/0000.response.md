Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in the given iterable (in this case, a generator expression) are true. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding item in the list is equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. If any item in the list is not equal to the given element, the `all()` function will immediately return `False`.

This function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty lists: The `all()` function returns `True` for an empty iterable, which is the correct result, as the statement "all items in the list are equal to the given element" is vacuously true for an empty list.
* Lists with a single element: The function correctly returns `True` if the single element is equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.
* Lists with multiple elements: The function correctly returns `True` if all elements are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly, it is considered correct.
