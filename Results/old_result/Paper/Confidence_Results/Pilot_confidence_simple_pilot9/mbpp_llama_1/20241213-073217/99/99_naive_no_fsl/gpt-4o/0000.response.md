Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly removes the characters at odd index values from a given string. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the string, selecting only the characters at even indices (`i % 2 == 0`). The resulting list of characters is then joined back into a string using `''.join()`. 

This approach ensures that all characters at odd indices are excluded from the output string, as required by the problem description. The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of the function for various input strings.

The function handles strings of any length and content, and it does not contain any logic that could potentially lead to incorrect results. It correctly interprets the indexing as 0-based, meaning the first character is at index 0 (even), which is a standard convention in Python. 

Since no potential cases could be identified where the function would not work as expected, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
