Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately counts the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple. Here's why:

- The function uses a generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` to count the occurrences of each element from the list `lst` in the tuple `tup`.
- The `count()` method of the tuple returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple.
- The `sum()` function then adds up these counts to give the total occurrence of all elements from the list in the tuple.
- This approach works correctly regardless of the size of the tuple or the list, and it handles duplicate elements in both the tuple and the list as expected.
- It also correctly counts elements that appear multiple times in the list by potentially counting each instance of an element in the tuple separately for each occurrence of that element in the list.

The function does not check if elements in the list or tuple are unique, nor does it need to, since its task is simply to count occurrences. Moreover, it assumes that the elements in the list and tuple are hashable (can be compared with `==`), which is consistent with the requirement of elements in a tuple and the typical expectation for elements in a list.

For example, if you have a tuple `tup = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)` and a list `lst = [1, 2]`, the function will correctly return `4` because the element `1` occurs twice in the tuple and the element `2` occurs twice as well.

Without any obvious edge cases that the function does not handle correctly, and given its straightforward implementation that matches the problem description, it seems the function is correct for all potential cases.
