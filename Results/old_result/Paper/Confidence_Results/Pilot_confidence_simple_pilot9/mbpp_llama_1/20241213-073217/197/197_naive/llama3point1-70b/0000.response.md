Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and count its occurrences in the tuple using the `count` method. The `sum` function then adds up these counts to give the total occurrences.

This function works correctly for all possible cases, including:

- When the list and tuple are empty.
- When the list and tuple contain the same elements.
- When the list and tuple contain different elements.
- When the list contains duplicate elements that are also in the tuple.
- When the tuple contains duplicate elements that are also in the list.

For example, if `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and `lst = [2, 3, 4]`, the function will return `3` because `2` occurs twice in the tuple and `3` occurs once, while `4` does not occur at all.

Therefore, the function meets the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
