Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the given list of lists, sorting each sublist in-place using the built-in `sorted` function. The `sorted` function returns a new list containing the elements of the original list in sorted order, which is then used to replace the original sublist in the list of lists.

The program handles the case where the sublists contain strings, and it correctly sorts these strings lexicographically (i.e., in alphabetical order). The program also handles sublists of different lengths and with different types of strings (e.g., strings with spaces or different cases).

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program for various inputs, including lists with strings of different lengths and contents. The program produces the expected output for each test case, indicating that it is working as intended.

Overall, the program correctly implements the desired functionality of sorting each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, and it handles various edge cases and input scenarios correctly.
