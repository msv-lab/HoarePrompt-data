Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(d, n)` takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the desired entries.

Here is a breakdown of why the code is correct:

- It iterates over each key-value pair in the input dictionary `d`.
- For each pair, it checks if the value `v` is greater than or equal to the given integer `n`.
- If the condition is met, it includes the key-value pair in the resulting dictionary.
- The function returns the resulting dictionary, which only contains entries with values greater than or equal to `n`.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty dictionaries: The function returns an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
- Dictionaries with no entries meeting the condition: The function returns an empty dictionary.
- Dictionaries with all entries meeting the condition: The function returns the original dictionary.
- Dictionaries with a mix of entries that do and do not meet the condition: The function correctly filters out the entries that do not meet the condition.

Overall, the code is correct and implements the desired functionality as described in the problem description.
