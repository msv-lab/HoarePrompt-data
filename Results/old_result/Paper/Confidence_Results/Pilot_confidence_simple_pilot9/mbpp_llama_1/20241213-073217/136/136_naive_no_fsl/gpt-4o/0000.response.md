Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` filters a dictionary `d` based on the condition that the value of each entry should be greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

This function correctly handles all potential cases:

1. **Empty Dictionary**: If the input dictionary is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
2. **Dictionary with No Matching Values**: If the dictionary contains no values greater than or equal to `n`, the function will return an empty dictionary.
3. **Dictionary with All Values Greater Than or Equal to `n`**: If all values in the dictionary are greater than or equal to `n`, the function will return the original dictionary.
4. **Dictionary with Mixed Values**: If the dictionary contains a mix of values, some of which are greater than or equal to `n` and some of which are less than `n`, the function will return a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` is the minimum or maximum possible integer value, or when the dictionary contains duplicate values.

After analyzing the function and considering various potential cases, I was unable to find any scenario where the function does not behave as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
