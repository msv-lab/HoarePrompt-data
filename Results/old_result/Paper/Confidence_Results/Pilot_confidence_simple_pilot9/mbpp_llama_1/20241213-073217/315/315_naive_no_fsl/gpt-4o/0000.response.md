Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the tuple. The tuple is first converted to a list using the `list()` function, and then concatenated to the original list using the `+` operator.

This program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description. It adds the given tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it to the original list. All the provided unit tests pass, and there are no apparent edge cases that the code does not handle. 

For example, if the input list is empty or the tuple is empty, the function still works as expected:
```python
print(func_1([], (1, 2)))  # Output: [1, 2]
print(func_1([1, 2], ()))  # Output: [1, 2]
```
The function also works correctly when the tuple contains multiple elements:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2], (3, 4, 5)))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
Since all potential cases seem to be handled correctly, the program is considered correct.
