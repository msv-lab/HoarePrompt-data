Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a `main_string` and a `sub_string` as input and returns the occurrence and position of the `sub_string` within the `main_string`. If there is no match, it returns `None`.

The function uses the `find` method to get the starting position of the `sub_string` in the `main_string`. If the `sub_string` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the ending position by adding the length of the `sub_string` to the starting position.

The program seems to correctly handle all potential cases. The provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various scenarios, including multiple occurrences of the `sub_string` and cases where the `sub_string` is not found.

The function works as expected because the `find` method in Python returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the specified value is not found, it returns `-1`. The function also correctly calculates the ending position of the `sub_string` by adding its length to the starting position.

Since the function correctly handles all the test cases and follows the problem description, it is correct. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
