Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly finds the occurrence and position of the first substring within a string and returns `None` if there is no match. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- It uses the `find` method to get the starting index of the first occurrence of the substring.
- If the substring is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, it calculates the ending index by adding the length of the substring to the starting index and returns a tuple containing the substring, starting index, and ending index.

This code handles all potential cases, including:

- When the substring is present in the string: it returns the correct occurrence and position.
- When the substring is not present in the string: it returns `None`.
- When the substring is empty: it returns the correct occurrence and position (starting index `0` and ending index `-1`).
- When the string is empty: it returns `None` if the substring is not empty, or a tuple with empty substring and indices `(0, -1)` if the substring is also empty.

Since the code handles all potential cases correctly and meets the requirements specified in the problem description, it is correct.
