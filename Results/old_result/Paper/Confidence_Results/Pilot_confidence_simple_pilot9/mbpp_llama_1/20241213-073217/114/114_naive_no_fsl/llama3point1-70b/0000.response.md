Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The `count` method of a tuple in Python returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple, which directly aligns with the problem description. 

Here's why the function works as expected:
- It takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as inputs, allowing for any type of element that can be compared (e.g., numbers, strings, etc.).
- The `count` method is a standard tuple method in Python, and it correctly counts the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.
- This function will work correctly for all possible inputs where the element can be compared, including empty tuples and tuples with no occurrences of the element, in which case it will correctly return 0.
- The function does not handle cases where the input is not a tuple or the element is not a comparable type, but these are outside the scope defined by the problem description.

Therefore, within the constraints and definitions provided by the problem, the function operates as specified, making the program correct according to the problem description.
