Correctness: **True**

The given Python program checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list. The function `func_1` iterates over the list starting from index 1 (which is the first odd index in Python, as indexing starts at 0) up to the end of the list, stepping by 2 each time to only consider odd indices.

In the loop, it checks if the number at the current index is even by using the modulus operator (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If an even number is found at any odd index, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all odd indices contain odd numbers.

If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that every odd index in the list indeed contains an odd number.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases:

- The first test case `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True` checks a list where odd indices have odd numbers.
- The second test case `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True` checks a short list with an odd number at the first odd index.
- The third test case `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False` checks a list where the first odd index contains an even number, expecting the function to return `False`.

All these tests pass, and upon closer inspection, the function's logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases. The function correctly handles lists of varying lengths and compositions, checking only the odd indices for the presence of odd numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
