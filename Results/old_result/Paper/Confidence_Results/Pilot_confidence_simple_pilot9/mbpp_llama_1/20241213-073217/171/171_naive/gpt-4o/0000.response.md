Correctness: **True**.

The given program uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the division of the input number `n` by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, it returns `True`, indicating that the parity of the number is odd. This logic is correct and aligns with the mathematical definition of odd numbers.

For any integer `n`, if `n % 2!= 0`, then `n` is odd. The provided unit tests also confirm this behavior, such as `func_1(12)` returning `False` (as 12 is even) and `func_1(7)` returning `True` (as 7 is odd).

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and there are no edge cases that it fails to address, the program is considered correct. The provided assertions also pass, further verifying the correctness of the function.
