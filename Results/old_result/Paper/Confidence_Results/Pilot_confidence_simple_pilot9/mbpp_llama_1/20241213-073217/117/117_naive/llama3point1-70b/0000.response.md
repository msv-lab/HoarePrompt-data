Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(lst)` is designed to return the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list and checks if it is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`. 

This approach is correct because `isinstance(x, int)` returns `True` if `x` is an integer and `False` otherwise. When `True` is summed, it is treated as `1`, and `False` is treated as `0`. Therefore, the total sum will be the count of all integer elements in the list.

The function correctly handles lists containing various types of elements (e.g., integers, floats, strings) and empty lists. For example:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` will correctly return `3`.
- `func_1([1, 'a', 2.5, 3])` will correctly return `2` because it counts only the integers `1` and `3`.
- `func_1([])` will correctly return `0` because an empty list contains no integer elements.

Given the logic and the fact that it handles edge cases (like empty lists and lists with mixed types of elements), the function works as expected according to the problem description.
