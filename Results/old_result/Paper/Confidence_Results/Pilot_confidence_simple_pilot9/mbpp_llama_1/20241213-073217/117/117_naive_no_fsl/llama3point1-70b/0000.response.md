Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It defines a function that takes a list `lst` as input and returns the number of integer elements in that list.

Here's why the function works as expected:

- The `isinstance(x, int)` function checks if an element `x` is an instance of the `int` type.
- The generator expression `(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values indicating whether each element in the list is an integer.
- The `sum` function treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, effectively counting the number of `True` values, which correspond to the integer elements in the list.

This approach correctly handles various cases, including:

- Empty lists: `func_1([])` returns 0, as expected.
- Lists with only integers: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns 3.
- Lists with integers and other types: `func_1([1, 'a', 2, 3.0])` returns 2, because only `1` and `2` are integers.
- Lists with no integers: `func_1(['a', 'b', 3.0])` returns 0, because there are no integer elements.

Given that the function handles these cases correctly and follows the problem description, it is considered correct.
