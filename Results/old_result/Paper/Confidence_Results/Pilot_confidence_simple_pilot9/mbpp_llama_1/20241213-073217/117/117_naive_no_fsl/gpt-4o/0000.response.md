Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`, which returns `True` if the element is an integer and `False` otherwise. The `sum` function then adds up all the `True` values (treated as 1) and `False` values (treated as 0), effectively counting the number of integers in the list.

The function handles various cases correctly, including lists with mixed data types (integers, floats, strings), lists containing only integers, and lists containing no integers. The provided unit tests demonstrate this, and there are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. 

For example, it correctly handles:
- A list with integers, floats, and strings: `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`
- A list with only integers: `[1, 2, 3]`
- A list with integers and floats: `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]`

Given the logic of the function and the provided test cases, there is no reason to believe it would not work as expected for any list of elements. Therefore, the function is considered correct based on the problem description.
