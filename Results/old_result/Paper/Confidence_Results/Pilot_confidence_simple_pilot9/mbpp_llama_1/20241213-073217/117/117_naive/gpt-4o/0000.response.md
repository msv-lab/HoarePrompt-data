Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly returns the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`. If the element is an integer, it counts towards the sum, which effectively counts the number of integer elements in the list.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including lists containing a mix of integers, floats, and strings, as well as lists consisting entirely of integers. The function handles these cases as expected, correctly identifying and counting the integer elements.

Without being able to find a case where the function does not behave as expected according to the problem description, the conclusion is that the function is correct for all potential cases it is designed to handle.
