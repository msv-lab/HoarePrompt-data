Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` sorts a list of elements in ascending order. The function uses a technique similar to a selection sort algorithm. Here's why I believe the code is correct:

- The outer loop (`for size in range(n, 0, -1)`) iterates over the list from the last element to the first, considering one less element in each iteration.
- Inside the loop, it finds the maximum value in the unsorted part of the list (`arr[:size]`) and its index (`max_index`).
- If the maximum value is not at the end of the unsorted part, it reverses the part of the list from the beginning to `max_index + 1` (this is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the algorithm) and then reverses the entire unsorted part (`arr[:size]`), effectively moving the maximum value to the end of the unsorted part.
- This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

The algorithm seems to correctly sort the list in ascending order for all possible cases, including lists with duplicate elements, negative numbers, and lists of different lengths. 

I have not found any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

However, please note that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the index method and slicing operations inside the loop, making it less efficient for large lists. A more efficient sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort would be preferable for large datasets.
