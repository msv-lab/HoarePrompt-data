Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach is correct because it considers all possible pairs of elements in the array and finds the maximum difference.

The `max(arr)` function returns the largest item in an iterable (in this case, the array), and the `min(arr)` function returns the smallest item. The difference between these two values is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

This function works correctly for all possible input arrays, including:

* Arrays with positive and negative numbers
* Arrays with duplicate numbers
* Arrays with a single element (in which case the function returns 0, as there are no pairs to compare)
* Empty arrays (although this case is not explicitly handled, it would raise a ValueError in Python, which might be considered correct behavior depending on the problem description)

The code is concise, readable, and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) due to the `max` and `min` functions. Overall, the function correctly implements the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.
