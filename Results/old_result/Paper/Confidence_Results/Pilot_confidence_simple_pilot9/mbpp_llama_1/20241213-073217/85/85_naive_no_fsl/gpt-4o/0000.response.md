Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. This function works by first identifying the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions. It then calculates the difference between these two values, which inherently will be the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array, since you're comparing the largest value against the smallest.

The function handles the problem description accurately for all potential cases because it doesn't rely on the position of the elements or any specific ordering, other than finding the absolute minimum and maximum. This approach ensures that it will work correctly for any array of numbers, regardless of how the numbers are distributed or ordered within the array.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4` and `assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8`, reinforce this correctness by demonstrating the function's ability to correctly identify the maximum difference in various scenarios.

Given that the function operates on the fundamental principle of subtracting the smallest value from the largest to find the maximum difference, and considering the nature of the unit tests which validate its functionality across different sets of data, it's reasonable to conclude that the function meets the problem's requirements in every potential case.
