Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Instead, it appears to be calculating the nth number in a sequence that is not related to prime numbers. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers of the form 4n^2 + 1, 4n^2 - 1, 4n^2 + 4n + 1, or 4n^2 + 4n - 1, where n is a positive integer. The provided program does not match this definition.

A simple test case to demonstrate the incorrectness of the program is `func_1(2)`. The program returns 5, which is the third number in the sequence generated by the program, but it is not the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

To implement a function that finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, a more complex approach would be required, involving checking for primality and generating numbers according to the specified forms. The provided program does not meet these requirements and therefore is incorrect.
