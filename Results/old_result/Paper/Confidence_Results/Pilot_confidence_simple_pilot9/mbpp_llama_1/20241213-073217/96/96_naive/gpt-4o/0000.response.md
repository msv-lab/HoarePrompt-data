Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it properly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. Here's why:

- It handles the edge case where the tuple is empty (`if not tup: return True`). An empty tuple can be considered as having all elements of the same type, because there are no elements to compare.
- It then sets the type of the first element as a reference (`first_type = type(tup[0])`).
- It iterates over each element in the tuple. If an element's type does not match the reference type (`if type(element)!= first_type: return False`), it immediately returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any type mismatches, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements have the same type.

This approach covers all possible cases, including tuples with elements of different types, empty tuples, and tuples with a single element, because in the latter case, the loop will not find any mismatches and will return `True`.

The provided assertions also support the correctness of the function. The function works as expected with tuples containing integers, a mix of integers and strings, and another tuple of integers, all of which are covered by the assertions.

To further verify, consider the following additional test cases:
- `func_1((True, False, True))`: Should return `True` because all elements are booleans.
- `func_1((1.2, 3.4, 5.6))`: Should return `True` because all elements are floats.
- `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'))`: Should return `True` because all elements are strings.
- `func_1((1, '2', 3.0))`: Should return `False` because elements are of different types.

All these test cases are passed by the provided function, which confirms its correctness.
