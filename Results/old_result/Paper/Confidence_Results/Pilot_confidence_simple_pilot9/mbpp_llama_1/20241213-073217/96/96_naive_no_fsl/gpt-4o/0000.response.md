Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and iterates over each element in the tuple. It first checks if the tuple is empty, in which case it returns `True` because there are no elements with different data types. Then, it stores the data type of the first element in the tuple and compares it with the data type of each subsequent element. If it finds an element with a different data type, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all elements and doesn't find any with a different data type, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple have the same data type.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- An empty tuple: The function correctly returns `True` for an empty tuple, as there are no elements with different data types.
- A tuple with a single element: The function will return `True` because there's only one element to compare with itself.
- Tuples with elements of the same data type: The function correctly returns `True` for tuples where all elements have the same data type.
- Tuples with elements of different data types: The function correctly returns `False` for tuples where not all elements have the same data type.

Given the provided unit tests and considering the logic of the function, it appears that the function works correctly for all potential input cases. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
