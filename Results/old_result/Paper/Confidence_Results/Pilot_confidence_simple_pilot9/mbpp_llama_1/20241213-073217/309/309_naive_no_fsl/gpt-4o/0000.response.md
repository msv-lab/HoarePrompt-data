Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a string are the same or not. It handles the edge case where the input string is empty, in which case it returns `True`. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It first checks if the string is empty. If it is, the function returns `True` because there are no characters to compare.
- If the string is not empty, it stores the first character of the string in the `first_char` variable.
- Then, it iterates over each character in the string. If it finds a character that is different from the `first_char`, it immediately returns `False`.
- If it iterates over the entire string without finding any characters that are different from the `first_char`, it returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.

After analyzing the function, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles empty strings and strings with all the same characters, as well as strings with different characters. The unit tests provided also support this conclusion, as they cover a variety of cases and the function passes all of them. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
