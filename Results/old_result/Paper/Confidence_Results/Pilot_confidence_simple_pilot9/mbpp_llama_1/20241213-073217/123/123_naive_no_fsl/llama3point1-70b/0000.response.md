Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It accurately implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs, splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

The code uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this. `lst[:L]` gets all elements up to but not including the `L`-th index (i.e., the first `L` elements), and `lst[L:]` gets all elements from the `L`-th index to the end of the list. This effectively splits the list into two parts as required.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

- If `L` is 0, it returns an empty list as the first element of the tuple and the original list as the second element.
- If `L` equals the length of the list, it returns the original list as the first element and an empty list as the second element.
- If `L` is greater than the length of the list, it returns the original list as the first element and an empty list as the second element, because `lst[:L]` will simply return the entire list when `L` exceeds the list's length.
- For negative `L`, Python's list slicing will treat it as an indexing starting from the end, which could lead to unexpected results if not considered, but since the problem statement asks for the length of the first part to be `L`, and list slicing handles negative indices by counting from the end, the function still operates as intended in the context of getting the first `L` elements, but it's worth noting this might not be the desired behavior in all contexts. However, based strictly on the problem description without additional constraints on `L`, the function behaves as expected for the specified task.

Since the function correctly handles all specified scenarios and potential edge cases based on the problem description, it can be considered correct.
