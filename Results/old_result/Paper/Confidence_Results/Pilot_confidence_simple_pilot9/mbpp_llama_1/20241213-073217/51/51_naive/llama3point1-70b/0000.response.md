Correctness: **False**.

The problem with this code is that it does not handle the case when the input list is empty. In such a case, the `len(numbers)` will be zero and dividing by zero will result in a ZeroDivisionError. The function should handle this case either by returning an error message or by returning a specific value to indicate that the operation cannot be performed.

Additionally, if the list contains a zero, the product will be zero and the function will return zero, which might be the expected result. However, if the list contains a combination of positive and negative numbers, the product could be negative, and the function will return a negative result, which might or might not be the expected result.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3])`, the function will return `2.0`, which seems to be the correct result. However, if we call `func_1([])`, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError, which indicates that the function does not handle this case correctly.

To fix this issue, the function could be modified to check if the list is empty before attempting to calculate the product and divide by the length. Here's a possible modification:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return 0  # or any other value that makes sense for an empty list
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```
