Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it does not handle the case where the input list is empty. In this case, `len(numbers)` will be 0, which will result in a ZeroDivisionError when trying to divide by it. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input list contains at least one zero. In this case, the product will be 0, and the function will return 0, but it does not check if the list contains non-zero numbers that would make the division operation valid. However, this case still works according to the description, as multiplying all numbers including zero results in zero, and zero divided by the length of the list is zero.

A more significant issue arises when the input list is empty, as this would cause a ZeroDivisionError in the provided code. The code does not include any error checking or handling for this potential case. 

To fix these issues, the code could be modified to check if the list is empty before attempting the division, and it could also consider handling the case where the list contains zeros, although this is not strictly necessary according to the problem description provided. 

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly: If the input list is `[]`, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError. 

Example test case: 
```python
# Test case where the program does not work correctly
numbers = []
try:
    result = func_1(numbers)
    print("Result:", result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero")
```
