Correctness: **True**

The given program uses a set to find duplicate elements in an array of integers. The function `func_1` checks if the length of the input array `arr` is equal to the length of a set created from the array. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements, meaning it automatically removes any duplicates.

If the lengths are not equal, it means there were duplicate elements in the array, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach is correct for every potential case because sets in Python handle all hashable types (like integers), and they properly handle cases with zero or one element, as well as cases with multiple elements.

For example, if we pass an array with no duplicates, like `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will correctly return `False`. If we pass an array with duplicates, like `[1, 2, 2]`, the function will correctly return `True`. This approach also correctly handles edge cases such as an empty array `[]`, which should return `False`, and an array with a single element, like `[1]`, which should also return `False`.

Therefore, the given program correctly implements a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element, according to the problem description.
