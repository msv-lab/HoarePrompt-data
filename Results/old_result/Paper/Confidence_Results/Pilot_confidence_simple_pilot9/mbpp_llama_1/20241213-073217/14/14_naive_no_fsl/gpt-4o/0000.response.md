Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. It uses a set `seen` to keep track of the elements it has encountered so far. If it encounters an element that is already in the `seen` set, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that there is a duplicate element in the array. If it iterates through the entire array without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program. The function correctly identifies arrays with duplicate elements and those without. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles arrays of any size and with any combination of integers, including negative numbers and zero. It also correctly handles arrays with multiple duplicate elements, as demonstrated by the test case `assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True`. 

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because it makes a single pass through the array. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, it needs to store all elements in the `seen` set. 

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it meets the requirements of the problem description.
