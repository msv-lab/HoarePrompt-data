Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to extract the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists. The function utilizes list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and selects the first element of each sublist using `sublist[0]`.

The code is correct because it handles the task as described in the problem statement. It correctly returns a list containing the first element of each sublist for any given list of lists. The provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various inputs, including lists with sublists of different lengths.

The function does not contain any apparent edge cases that it does not handle correctly. For example, it will correctly return an empty list if the input list is empty, and it will correctly handle sublists that contain only one element. If a sublist is empty, attempting to access its first element (`sublist[0]`) will raise an `IndexError`, but based on the problem description and the provided tests, it seems that the function is expected to work with non-empty sublists.

Without a specific test case that demonstrates incorrect behavior, and considering the problem description and the code provided, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases within the scope of the problem description.
