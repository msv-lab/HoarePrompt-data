Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes an input list and returns a tuple representation of the same. This is achieved by using the built-in `tuple()` function, which converts an iterable (like a list) into a tuple.

To verify the correctness of this program, let's consider various potential cases:

1. **Empty List**: If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function should return an empty tuple `()`. This works as expected because `tuple([])` returns `()`.

2. **List with Elements**: For a list containing elements, such as `[1, 2, 3]`, the function should return the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`. This also works as expected since `tuple([1, 2, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 3)`.

3. **List with Mixed Data Types**: If the list contains mixed data types, like `[1, 'a', True]`, the function correctly returns the tuple `(1, 'a', True)` because tuples can contain elements of different data types.

4. **Nested Lists**: For a list that contains nested lists, such as `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`, the function returns `([1, 2], [3, 4])`. This is the expected behavior, as the `tuple()` function does not flatten the input list.

5. **Input Validation**: The program does not include explicit input validation to check if the input is indeed a list. However, Python's dynamic typing and the nature of the `tuple()` function mean that passing a non-list input will result in a TypeError if the input is not an iterable, or it will work correctly if the input is another type of iterable (like a string or another tuple). While this could be considered a limitation, it does not inherently make the function incorrect based on the provided problem description, which does not specify input validation requirements.

Given these considerations, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases related to the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. Therefore, the program is correct based on the description provided.
