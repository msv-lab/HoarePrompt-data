Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple. The function uses Python's built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input list into a tuple.

This program is correct because it meets the problem description for every potential case. The `tuple()` function in Python converts all elements of an iterable (like a list) into a tuple, which is an immutable collection of values. 

In all the provided test cases, `func_1` correctly converts the input lists into tuples, regardless of the size and content of the lists. Additionally, this function will work with lists containing any type of elements (not just numbers), as long as the elements are hashable (i.e., they can be used as dictionary keys).

One potential edge case to consider is what happens if the input is not a list. For example, if the input is a string or another type of iterable, such as a set or a dictionary. In this case, the `tuple()` function will still work correctly, but it will throw an error if the input is not an iterable. However, based on the problem description, which specifically asks to convert a list to a tuple, it is reasonable to assume that the input will always be a list.

Another edge case is an empty list. However, `tuple()` also handles this case correctly, returning an empty tuple `()`. 

Since we couldn't think of any potential case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.
