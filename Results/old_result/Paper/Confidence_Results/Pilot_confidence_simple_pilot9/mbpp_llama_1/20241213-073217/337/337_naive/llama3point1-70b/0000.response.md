Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(lst)` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. This is achieved by using a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`. For each element, the `count` method is used to check if the element appears only once in the list. If it does, the element is included in the sum.

This function appears to be correct for all potential cases because it:

1. Handles empty lists: If the input list is empty, the function will simply return 0, which is the correct sum of non-repeated elements (since there are no elements).

2. Handles lists with repeated elements: The function correctly identifies and excludes elements that appear more than once in the list.

3. Handles lists with unique elements: If all elements in the list are unique, the function will sum all of them, which is the correct behavior.

4. Handles lists with mixed cases: The function works correctly even when the list contains a mix of repeated and unique elements.

However, it's worth noting that this function may not be efficient for large lists because the `count` method has to scan the entire list for each element, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2). A more efficient solution would use a dictionary or a Counter object to keep track of element counts, but this would not affect the correctness of the function.
