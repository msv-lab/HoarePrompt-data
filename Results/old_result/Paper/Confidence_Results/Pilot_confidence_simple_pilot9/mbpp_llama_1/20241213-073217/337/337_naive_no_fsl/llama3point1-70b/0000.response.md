Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and checks if the count of the element in the list is equal to 1 using the `count` method. If the count is 1, it means the element is non-repeated and its value is added to the sum.

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: The function returns 0, which is the expected result because there are no non-repeated elements.
- Lists with all unique elements: The function returns the sum of all elements, which is correct because all elements are non-repeated.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function correctly ignores the repeated elements and only adds the non-repeated elements to the sum.
- Lists with negative numbers and/or zero: The function works correctly for lists containing negative numbers and/or zero, as the `count` method and `sum` function handle these cases correctly.

No potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
