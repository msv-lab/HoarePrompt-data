Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string `s`. This is because the `count()` method in Python returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the string. 

For example, if `s = "stdstdstd"`, `func_1(s)` will return `3`, which is the correct count of the substring 'std'. The function will work correctly for any string, regardless of whether 'std' appears zero, one, or multiple times, or if it appears at the start, middle, or end of the string. 

The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle, as the `count()` method is designed to handle these cases. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
