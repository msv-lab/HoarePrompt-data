Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the n'th Lucas number correctly. The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The function correctly handles the base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1`, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For `n > 1`, it uses a loop to iteratively calculate the Lucas numbers up to the n'th number, using the recurrence relation `L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)`. The loop starts from `n = 2` because the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` are already handled.

Since the function correctly implements the Lucas sequence formula for all non-negative integers `n`, it should work as expected for every potential case, and thus, the program is correct.
