Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element. If the element is not found, the function returns `-1` as the index position.

Here's why the program seems to work correctly:

- The `array.index(element)` method is used to find the index of the element in the array. If the element is found, its index is returned and the function returns a tuple with `True` and the index.
- If the element is not found, a `ValueError` exception is raised, which is caught by the `except` block. In this case, the function returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`, indicating that the element was not found.
- The function handles both cases where the element is present and where it is not present in the array.

Since I couldn't find any example or edge case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
