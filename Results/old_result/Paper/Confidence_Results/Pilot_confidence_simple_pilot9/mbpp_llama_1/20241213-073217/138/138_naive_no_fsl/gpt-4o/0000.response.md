Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The program uses a simple iterative approach to find the element in the array. It iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element. If the value matches the given element, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the function completes the iteration without finding the element, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program for various scenarios, including cases where the element is found at different index positions and cases where the element is not found.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work as expected. The program handles all possible scenarios, including:

* Finding the element at any index position in the array
* Not finding the element in the array
* Handling arrays of different lengths and with different elements

Overall, the program is well-written and meets the requirements of the problem description, so I conclude that it is correct.
