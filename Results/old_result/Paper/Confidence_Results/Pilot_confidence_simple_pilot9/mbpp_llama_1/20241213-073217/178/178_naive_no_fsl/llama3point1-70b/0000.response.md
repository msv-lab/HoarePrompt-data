Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct as it follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number using a list comprehension, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list. 

The program handles various potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty lists: Although not explicitly tested, the function should handle an empty list correctly by returning 0, as the sum of an empty list is 0 and the length of an empty list is 0. However, it's worth noting that the function does not explicitly check for this edge case, but the built-in functions it uses (`sum` and `len`) handle it correctly.
- Lists containing only integers: Since integers are already "rounded," the function will simply calculate the sum of the integers and multiply it by the length of the list.
- Lists containing floating-point numbers: The function correctly rounds each floating-point number to the nearest integer using the `round` function.
- Lists containing a mix of integers and floating-point numbers: The function will round the floating-point numbers and then sum all the numbers (rounded floating-point numbers and integers), finally multiplying this sum by the length of the list.

Given that the program correctly implements the described functionality without any obvious edge cases that it fails to handle, and considering the robustness of the built-in functions it uses, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
