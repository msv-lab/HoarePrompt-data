Correctness: **True**

The provided code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` rounds every number in the given list of numbers using a list comprehension and the built-in `round` function. Then, it calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers using the built-in `sum` function. Finally, it returns the total sum multiplied by the length of the list, which is obtained using the `len` function.

The code handles all potential cases, including empty lists (which would result in a sum of 0 and a length of 0, correctly returning 0), lists containing only integers (which would not be rounded), lists containing only floating-point numbers (which would be rounded correctly), and lists containing a mix of integers and floating-point numbers. The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the function for different inputs. 

The function does not have any obvious edge cases that are not handled correctly, such as division by zero, indexing errors, or incorrect rounding. Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the function appears to be correct.
