Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the given Python function, `func_1`, and its problem description, which asks to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function first merges and sorts the two lists. It then calculates the median based on whether the total length of the merged list is even or odd.

The function correctly handles both cases for calculating the median:

1. When the length of the merged list is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements.
2. When the length of the merged list is odd, it calculates the median as the middle element.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs. 

Upon reviewing the code and problem description, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the given Python program correctly implements the function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.
