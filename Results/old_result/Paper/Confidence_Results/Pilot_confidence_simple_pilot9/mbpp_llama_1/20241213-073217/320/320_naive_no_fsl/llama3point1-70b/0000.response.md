Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then back to a list.
2. It checks if the length of the unique numbers list is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `None`, which is a reasonable handling of the case where there is no second smallest number (e.g., when the input list contains only one unique number or is empty).
3. If the length of the unique numbers list is 2 or more, the function sorts the list and returns the second element, which is the second smallest number.

This approach handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists
* Lists with a single unique number
* Lists with two or more unique numbers
* Lists with duplicate numbers

The program correctly handles edge cases, such as an input list containing only one unique number or an empty list. Additionally, the use of `set` to remove duplicates ensures that the function works efficiently even for large input lists.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
