Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function is designed to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's a breakdown of how it works and why it is correct:

1. The function `func_1(nums)` starts by converting the input list `nums` into a set `unique_nums` to eliminate duplicate numbers. This is done using the line `unique_nums = list(set(nums))`.

2. It then checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number in the list. This check is necessary because if a list contains only one unique number, there cannot be a second smallest number.

3. If `unique_nums` has two or more elements, the function sorts `unique_nums` in ascending order using `sorted(unique_nums)`. The second smallest number is then the element at index 1 of the sorted list (since indexing starts at 0), which is retrieved by `sorted(unique_nums)[1]`.

The function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Lists with duplicate numbers
- Lists with only one unique number
- Empty lists (though not explicitly handled, the `len(unique_nums) < 2` condition would be true for an empty list, and the function would return `None`, which could be considered a reasonable response)
- Lists with negative numbers or zero

Given the function's logic and handling of various cases, it aligns with the problem description and should work as expected for all inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
