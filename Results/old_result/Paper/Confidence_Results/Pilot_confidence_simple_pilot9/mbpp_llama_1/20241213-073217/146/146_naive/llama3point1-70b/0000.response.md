Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is attempting to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. However, it has a flaw in its approach. When there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the program returns only the first one it encounters, instead of returning all of them. 

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input list of lists has multiple sublists of the same maximum length, but they are not the first sublist. For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`, the program will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return `(3, [[1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8]])`. 

To fix this issue, the program should return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. The corrected program should be:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
