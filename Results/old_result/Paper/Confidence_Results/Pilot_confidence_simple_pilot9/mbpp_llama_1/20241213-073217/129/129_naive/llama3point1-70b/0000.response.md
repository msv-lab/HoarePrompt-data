Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function. This function works correctly for all single characters, including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and special characters. 

Here are a few examples that demonstrate the correctness of the function:
- `func_1('A')` returns `65`, which is the ASCII value of 'A'.
- `func_1('a')` returns `97`, which is the ASCII value of 'a'.
- `func_1('0')` returns `48`, which is the ASCII value of '0'.
- `func_1('@')` returns `64`, which is the ASCII value of '@'.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include error checking to ensure that the input is indeed a single character. If the input is not a single character (e.g., a string of length greater than 1 or an empty string), the function may not behave as expected. 

For example, if the input is an empty string (`func_1('')`), the function will raise a `TypeError` because the `ord` function expects a single character. If the input is a string of length greater than 1 (`func_1('ab')`), the function will return the ASCII value of the first character ('a' in this case), but this may not be the desired behavior.

Despite this potential issue, based solely on the provided problem description ("Write a function to find the ascii value of a character"), the function appears to be correct, assuming that the input will always be a single character. If the problem description included additional requirements, such as error checking or handling for non-character inputs, the function may be considered incorrect. But given the simple and straightforward nature of the problem description, the code provided meets the requirements.
