Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's why I believe it is correct:

1. **Handling empty list**: The function correctly returns `False` for an empty list.

2. **Handling non-consecutive numbers**: The function sorts the list first, which is necessary to check for consecutiveness. It then iterates through the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair with a difference other than 1, it returns `False`.

3. **Handling duplicate numbers**: The function also correctly handles lists with duplicate numbers. The sorting step ensures that if there are duplicate numbers, they will be next to each other in the sorted list. The subsequent iteration will then correctly identify that these numbers are not consecutive.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the function is working correctly:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True` as expected.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False` as expected.
- `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False` as expected, because after sorting, the list is `[1, 1, 2]`, which does not contain consecutive numbers due to the duplicate 1.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
