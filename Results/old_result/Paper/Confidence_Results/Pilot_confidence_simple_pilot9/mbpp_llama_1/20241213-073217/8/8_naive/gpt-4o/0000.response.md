Correctness: **True**

The given Python function appears to be correct. It checks for the first and last occurrences of a given character in a string, then returns the string with these two occurrences removed.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It uses the `find()` method to get the index of the first occurrence of the character and the `rfind()` method to get the index of the last occurrence.
2. If the character is not found (`first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`), it means the character does not exist in the string, so the function returns the original string.
3. If the first and last occurrences are at the same index (`first_index == last_index`), it means the character appears only once in the string. In this case, it also returns the original string, which aligns with the problem description of removing both the first and last occurrences.
4. If both occurrences are found and are different, it constructs a new string by concatenating three parts:
   - The substring before the first occurrence of the character (`s[:first_index]`).
   - The substring between the first and last occurrences of the character, excluding the last occurrence (`s[first_index + 1:last_index]`).
   - The substring after the last occurrence of the character (`s[last_index + 1:]`).

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further support the correctness of the function by covering various scenarios, including strings where the character appears more than once, strings where the character appears at the beginning and end, and strings with a single occurrence of the character. Given that the code handles all these cases correctly and aligns with the problem description, it is considered correct.
