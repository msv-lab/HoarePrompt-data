Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. For example, if the input string is "hello_world", the function will return "HelloWorld", but it should return "helloWorld" because the first word in camel case should not be capitalized. The function correctly capitalizes the first letter of each word, but it does not handle the case where the first word should remain in lower case.

In this case, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when the input string starts with a lower case letter, the output should also start with a lower case letter. 

Here is an example of the incorrect output:

Input: "hello_world"
Expected Output: "helloWorld"
Actual Output: "HelloWorld" 

This program can be corrected by not capitalizing the first word:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
