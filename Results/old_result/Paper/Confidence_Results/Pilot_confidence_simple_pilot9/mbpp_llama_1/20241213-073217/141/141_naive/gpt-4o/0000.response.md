Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether the frequency of each digit in the given integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. It first converts the integer into a string to easily iterate over each digit. Then, it creates a frequency dictionary to store the count of each digit.

The function works by iterating over the digits in the string representation of the number and updating the frequency dictionary accordingly. After that, it iterates over the items in the frequency dictionary and checks if the count of any digit is greater than the digit itself. If it finds such a case, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all digits without finding such a case, it returns `True`.

This function correctly handles all potential cases. It correctly counts the frequency of each digit and checks if it is less than or equal to the digit itself. It also handles edge cases such as when the input number has repeated digits or when the input number has no repeated digits. 

For example, when the input is `1234`, the function returns `True` because the frequency of each digit (1, 2, 3, 4) is 1, which is less than or equal to the digit itself. When the input is `51241`, the function returns `False` because the frequency of digit `1` is 2, which is greater than the digit itself. 

The function's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
