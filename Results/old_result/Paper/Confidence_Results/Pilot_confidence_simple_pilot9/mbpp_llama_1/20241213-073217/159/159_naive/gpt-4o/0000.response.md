Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1(radius, height)` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula `1/3 * Ï€ * r^2 * h`, where `r` is the radius of the cone's base and `h` is the height of the cone. This formula is mathematically correct for calculating the volume of a cone.

The provided unit tests also validate the function's correctness by comparing its output with the expected results for different input values of radius and height. The `math.isclose` function is used to account for floating point precision errors, which is a good practice.

The function does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly, such as negative values for radius or height, which would be invalid inputs for a cone's dimensions. However, the function does not explicitly check for these invalid inputs, it simply returns a result based on the input values. If the problem description requires the function to handle such edge cases, it would be considered incorrect.

But assuming that the function is intended to work with valid input values (i.e., non-negative numbers for radius and height), and that the formula used is correct, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs. 

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases that are mentioned, which is why the Correctness is **True**.
