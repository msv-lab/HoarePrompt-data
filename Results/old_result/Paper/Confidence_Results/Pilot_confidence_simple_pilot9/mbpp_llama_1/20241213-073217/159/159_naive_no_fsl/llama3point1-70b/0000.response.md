Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the volume of a cone for all potential cases. The formula used in the function `func_1` is the standard formula for the volume of a cone, which is `(1/3)Ï€r^2h`, where `r` is the radius of the base of the cone and `h` is the height of the cone.

The program handles all types of valid input values for the radius and height, including positive numbers and zero. For example, if the radius is 5 and the height is 10, the function will correctly return the volume of the cone.

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it is not handling. It does not attempt to handle invalid input values, such as negative numbers or non-numeric values, but this is not specified as a requirement in the problem description. If the problem description required the function to handle these cases, the program would be considered incorrect. However, based on the provided description, the program meets all the requirements and is therefore considered correct. 

For instance, for a cone with radius 5 and height 10, the volume would be:
```python
import math

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height

print(func_1(5, 10))
```
This will output the correct volume of the cone, which confirms that the program is working as expected.
