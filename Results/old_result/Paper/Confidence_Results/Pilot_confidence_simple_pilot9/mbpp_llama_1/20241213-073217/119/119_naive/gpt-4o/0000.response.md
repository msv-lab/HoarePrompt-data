Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`, `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`, and `assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)`, demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different input values.

The function's implementation, `return (b, a)`, directly returns a tuple with the second number `b` and then the first number `a`, which aligns with the problem description. There are no conditional statements or loops in the function, which means its behavior does not depend on the specific values of `a` and `b` beyond simply returning them in reverse order.

Considering various potential cases:

1. **Positive integers**: The function works correctly for all positive integers, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.
2. **Negative integers**: Although not explicitly tested, the function should work correctly for negative integers since the logic of returning `b` followed by `a` is independent of whether the numbers are positive or negative.
3. **Zero**: The function should also handle zero correctly, as `(0, 0)` would be returned for `func_1(0, 0)`, or `(b, 0)` if `a` is 0, which aligns with the expected behavior.
4. **Floats or other types of numbers**: While the provided unit tests focus on integers, the function's logic does not restrict it to integers only. It should work correctly for floats or other numeric types where the concept of "first" and "second" is well-defined.

Given that the function's behavior aligns with the problem description across a variety of potential cases, and without being able to identify a specific case where the function would not work as expected, the conclusion is that the function is correct.
