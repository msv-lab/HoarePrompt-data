Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function calculates `f_max(n)` incorrectly. It does not consider the prefix GCD values for all possible permutations but instead computes the GCD of a sequence formed by iterating through the numbers from 1 to `n`. This approach fails to capture the maximum possible number of distinct prefix GCD values for any permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`.

To illustrate, let's consider the case when `n = 6`. The correct `f_max(6)` should be 3 because for the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the GCD values for the prefixes are `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`, which gives only one distinct value. However, for the permutation `[1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5]`, the GCD values are `1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1`, which gives two distinct values. The permutation `[1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5]` results in GCD values `1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1`, which also gives two distinct values. Other permutations like `[1, 5, 3, 2, 6, 4]` result in GCD values `1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1`, again giving only two distinct values. Therefore, the maximum number of distinct GCD values (`f_max(6)`) is 3, not 2.

The `func_3` function relies on the incorrect value of `f_max_n` computed by `func_2`, leading to an incorrect count of permutations. Hence, the overall program is incorrect.
