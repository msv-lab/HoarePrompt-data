Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully address the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that all required operations are performed to make matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \). 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

In this case, the program should output `-1` because it's impossible to make matrix \( B \) match matrix \( A \) using the allowed operations. However, the current implementation will not detect this scenario and might produce an incorrect sequence of operations.

To illustrate, let's break down why the current implementation fails:

1. The program checks if all four elements in a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are `1`. If they are, it skips that operation.
2. It then checks if any of the four elements in a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are `1`, and if so, it adds the operation to the list.

However, this approach does not handle the case where the required operations cannot be combined to achieve the desired result. For the given example, no sequence of operations can turn all zeros into ones while maintaining the constraints.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly identify the impossibility of transforming \( B \) into \( A \) in certain scenarios. Hence, the program is incorrect.
