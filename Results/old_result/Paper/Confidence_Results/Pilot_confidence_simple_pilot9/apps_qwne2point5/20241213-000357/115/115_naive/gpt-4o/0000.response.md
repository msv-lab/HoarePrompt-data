Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the target matrix \(A\) cannot be achieved by performing the specified operations on matrix \(B\). Specifically, the program assumes that if all elements in the \(2 \times 2\) submatrices match the corresponding elements in \(A\), then those submatrices can be set to 1 without further checks. However, this is not always true.

Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
0 0 0
0 0 1
```

For this input, the program will output `0` because it does not check if setting the \(2 \times 2\) submatrices will result in the desired matrix \(A\). However, it is impossible to transform the initial matrix \(B\) (which is all zeros) into the given matrix \(A\) using the allowed operations, as the top-left and bottom-right corners cannot both be set to 1 independently without affecting other parts of the matrix.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly determine whether the transformation is possible, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
