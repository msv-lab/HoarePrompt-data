Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of unrecognized nucleotides ('?') exceeds the number needed to balance the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Specifically, if the number of '?' is greater than `n // 4`, it is impossible to replace the '?' such that each nucleotide type has an equal count. However, the current implementation does not check this condition before attempting to replace the '?' characters. This can lead to an incorrect output or an infinite loop if the program tries to satisfy the condition by replacing '?' with any nucleotide type, which might not be possible.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
?????????
```
The program will attempt to replace all '?' with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', but it is impossible to have an equal number of each type since there are 8 '?' and only 4 types. The program should output "===" in this case, but it does not. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
