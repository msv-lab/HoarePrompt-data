Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic for converting a number from the "golden system" to its decimal equivalent using the given formula. The program iterates over the digits of the input string in reverse order, calculates the decimal value based on the position of each digit, and sums these values to get the final decimal representation.

The comparison logic also seems correct, as it compares the decimal values of the two inputs and prints the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=') based on their relative sizes. Since the program handles all aspects of the problem as described and no edge cases or specific examples can be found where the program fails to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
