Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for converting a number from the golden system to its decimal equivalent using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \), where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The program then compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the appropriate comparison symbol ('>', '<', or '=').

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads two strings representing numbers in the golden system.
2. It defines a function `func_1` to convert a golden system string to its decimal value.
3. It converts both input strings to their decimal values using the `func_1` function.
4. It compares the decimal values and prints the appropriate comparison symbol.

Based on the problem description and the examples provided, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly. The function `func_1` iterates through the reversed string, calculates the weighted sum correctly, and handles the conversion from the golden system to the decimal system. Since no specific edge cases were mentioned in the problem description or the examples, and the provided program works as expected for the given examples, the program is considered correct.
