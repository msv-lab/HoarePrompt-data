Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the filenames need to be moved to ensure that all example tests come first, followed by the regular tests, with filenames starting from 1 without any gaps. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
5
11 0
1 1
2 0
3 1
4 0
```

The expected output should be:
```
4
move 1 1
move 4 3
move 2 4
move 3 2
```

However, the current implementation sorts the files in descending order of their types (regular tests first, then examples) and then moves them to their respective positions. This will result in the examples being moved to the beginning but not necessarily in the correct sequence. Specifically, the file "3" (an example) will be moved to position 2 instead of staying at position 1, leading to an incorrect output.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
