Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the number of players `n` is odd. According to the problem description, the tournament follows knockout rules with a specific constraint on the difference in the number of games played between two players. For odd `n`, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of games the winner can participate in.

For example, consider the input `5`:
- The program calculates `max_games = 5.bit_length() - 1`, which results in `2`.
- However, the correct answer should be `3`. Hereâ€™s how:
  - Pair the players as (1, 2), (3, 4), and let player 5 be a bye.
  - Winner of (1, 2) plays against the winner of (3, 4).
  - Then the winner of the previous match plays against player 5.
  - This shows the winner can participate in 3 games.

Thus, the program does not handle odd values of `n` correctly, making it incorrect.
