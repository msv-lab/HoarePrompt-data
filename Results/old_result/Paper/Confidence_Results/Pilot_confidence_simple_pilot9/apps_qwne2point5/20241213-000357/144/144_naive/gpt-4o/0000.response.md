Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple elements in the array can be decreased to the same value. For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 2
```

According to the problem description, Alyona can decrease any element to any positive integer less than or equal to its current value. Therefore, she can decrease both the second and third elements to 1. This would result in the array [1, 1, 1], and the mex of this array is 2.

However, the program calculates the mex by iterating through the sorted array and checking if each element is less than the current mex value. If so, it increments the mex value. This approach fails to account for the fact that multiple elements can be decreased to the same value, leading to an incorrect mex calculation.

For the given example [1, 2, 2], the program will output 3, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
