Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all elements in the array are greater than or equal to the current `mex` value. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the smallest element in the array is greater than 1. In such a case, the initial `mex` value of 1 cannot be achieved by decreasing any element, leading to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 2 2
```

The correct output should be 1 because Alyona can decrease each element to 1, making the `mex` value 1. However, the provided program will output 2, which is incorrect. This demonstrates that the program does not handle the case where the smallest element is greater than 1, hence it is not correct.
