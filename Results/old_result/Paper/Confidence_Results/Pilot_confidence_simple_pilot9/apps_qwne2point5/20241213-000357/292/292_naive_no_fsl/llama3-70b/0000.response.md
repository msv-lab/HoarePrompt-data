Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iteratively triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight becomes strictly larger than Bob's. The program counts the number of years it takes for this condition to be met and prints the result.

Given the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\), the program will always find a point where Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The loop will terminate when \(a > b\), and the counter `years` will give the number of years it took for this to happen.

Since the program handles all given examples and the constraints properly, it is correct.
