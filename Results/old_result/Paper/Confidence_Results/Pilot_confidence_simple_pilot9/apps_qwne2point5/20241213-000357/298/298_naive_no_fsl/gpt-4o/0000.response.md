Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` and `m` are both odd numbers and `area` is an integer but cannot form a valid triangle with the given constraints. Specifically, if `n` and `m` are both odd, `2 * area` will be even, but neither `n` nor `m` can accommodate this even value without making one of the coordinates zero, which would result in a degenerate triangle with zero area. For example, consider the input `3 3 3`, where the required area is `3`. The program will attempt to print coordinates that do not satisfy the triangle formation criteria:

- `print(f'{2 * area} 1')` will print `6 1`, which is out of bounds since `n` and `m` are only up to `3`.
- `print(f'0 1')` and `print(f'0 {m // 2}')` will also not form a valid non-degenerate triangle.

Thus, the program fails to provide a valid solution for certain cases, making it incorrect.
