Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the remaining length after the first two cuts cannot be divided into two unequal parts. Specifically, the program always sets `b` to `a`, which means it does not explore cases where the first two parts are different. For example, consider the input `20`. The program fails to count the valid splits like `{3, 5, 5, 7}` and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`, because it always sets `b` to `a`.

To fix this, the loop should allow `b` to take values from `a+1` to `n/2 - a - 1` to ensure that the remaining length can be split into two unequal parts. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, n // 2 - a):
            rem = n - (a + b + a + b)
            if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This corrected function ensures that the remaining length is split into two unequal parts, thus meeting the problem requirements.
