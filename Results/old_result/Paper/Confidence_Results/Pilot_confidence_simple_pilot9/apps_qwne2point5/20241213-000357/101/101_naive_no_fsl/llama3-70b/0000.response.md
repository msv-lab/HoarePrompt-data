Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find the smallest possible frame that satisfies the conditions. Specifically, the program calculates the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels and uses these to define the frame. However, this approach may not always result in the smallest possible frame that encloses all white pixels.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3
w..
..
.w.
```

The program would output:
```
+++
+++
+++
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
+w+
+w+
+w+
```

This is because the smallest possible frame that encloses all white pixels is a 1x1 frame, which the program fails to identify. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
