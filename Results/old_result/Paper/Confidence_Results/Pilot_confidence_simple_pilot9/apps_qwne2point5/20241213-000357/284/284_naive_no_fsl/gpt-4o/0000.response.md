Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. For any given \( n \), it iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If it finds an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop. Given the problem constraints and the guarantee that an answer exists within the specified range, the program will always find a valid \( m \). The `func_1` function correctly identifies prime numbers up to the upper limit provided. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints.
