Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is exactly `n * 2 - 2`. According to the problem description, when `k` reaches this value, Lara should be at cell (1, 2). However, the current implementation does not account for this specific boundary condition. For example, if we run the program with input `4 3 11`, the output should be `1 2`, but the current implementation incorrectly outputs `3 2`.

To fix this, the program should include a special check for `k == n * 2 - 2` to ensure Lara's position is correctly set to `(1, 2)` in this case.
