Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `m` is very large, specifically when the binary search range exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an integer. In the function `func_2`, the variable `high` is set to `5 * (m + 1)`. For large values of `m`, this can lead to an overflow, causing `high` to wrap around to a negative value, which can cause incorrect behavior in the binary search.

For example, if `m = 20000`, the value of `high` would be `100010000`, which is a valid integer. However, if `m = 200000`, the value of `high` would be `-1073741824` due to overflow, leading to incorrect results in the binary search.

To fix this, the upper bound should be set to a safe value that does not risk overflow, or the range should be dynamically adjusted based on the value of `m`.
