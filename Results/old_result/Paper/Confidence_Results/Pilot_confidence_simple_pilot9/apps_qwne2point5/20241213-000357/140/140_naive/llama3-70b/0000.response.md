Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to detect cycles in the graph. However, it does not consider the possibility of removing at most one edge to make the graph acyclic. Specifically, the `func_1` function checks for cycles but does not attempt to remove any edge to break the cycle. As a result, the program will only output 'NO' if a cycle is detected, without considering whether removing a single edge could make the graph acyclic.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
Input:
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
```

In this case, the graph contains a cycle \(1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1\). The provided code will detect this cycle and output 'NO'. However, the graph can be made acyclic by removing the edge \(3 \rightarrow 1\). Therefore, the program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge.
