Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic for minimizing the number of segments that Sofia has to draw with a ruler. According to the problem description, the goal is to draw \( n \) squares by minimizing the number of segments drawn with a ruler. However, the current implementation seems to overcomplicate the solution and does not correctly minimize the number of segments needed.

Let's analyze the provided logic:

1. The function `func_1` iterates through possible values of \( a \) and calculates \( b \) based on the formula \( b = \lceil \frac{n}{a} \rceil \).
2. It then calculates the number of segments needed as \( 2 \times (a + b) \) and updates the minimum number of segments needed.

This approach does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for drawing the minimum number of segments. A more straightforward and correct approach would be to realize that to draw \( n \) squares, the optimal way is to start by drawing the vertical and horizontal segments in a grid-like pattern. Specifically, to draw \( n \) squares, we need to draw \( \sqrt{n} \) rows and \( \sqrt{n} \) columns initially with rulers, and then the remaining segments can be guided by the previously drawn segments.

A correct implementation would be:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())
side_length = math.isqrt(n)  # Get the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to n
min_segments_needed = 2 * side_length  # Initial segments needed to form a grid

if side_length ** 2 < n:
    min_segments_needed += 2 * (n - side_length ** 2)  # Add additional segments needed to complete the remaining squares

print(min_segments_needed)
```

This code correctly calculates the minimum number of segments needed by forming a grid and then adding the necessary segments to complete the remaining squares. The provided code, however, does not handle the problem correctly and hence the correctness is **False**.
