Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program calculates `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.
2. This formula is intended to calculate the minimum number of segments needed based on the binary representation of \( n \). However, this formula is incorrect for small values of \( n \).

Let's consider a few test cases to illustrate the issue:

- For \( n = 1 \):
  - Expected output: 2 (as explained in the problem description)
  - Program output: \( 2 * (1.bit_length() - 1) + 2 = 2 * (1 - 1) + 2 = 2 \)
  - This part seems correct.

- For \( n = 2 \):
  - Expected output: 3 (as explained in the problem description)
  - Program output: \( 2 * (2.bit_length() - 1) + 2 = 2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 4 \)
  - This is incorrect because the correct answer should be 3.

- For \( n = 4 \):
  - Expected output: 4 (as explained in the problem description)
  - Program output: \( 2 * (4.bit_length() - 1) + 2 = 2 * (3 - 1) + 2 = 6 \)
  - This is incorrect because the correct answer should be 4.

Thus, the program does not handle the cases correctly, especially for small values of \( n \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
