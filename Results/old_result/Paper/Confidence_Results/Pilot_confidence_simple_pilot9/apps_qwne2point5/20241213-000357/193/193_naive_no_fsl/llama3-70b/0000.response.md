Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. According to the problem description, Memory needs to transform an equilateral triangle with side length `x` into one with side length `y` by modifying one side at a time while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., all sides remain positive integers and satisfy the triangle inequality).

The given program simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not take into account the triangle inequality or the requirement to modify one side at a time. For instance, consider the input `(6, 3)`:

- The program outputs `4`, but the correct output should be `4` based on the steps provided in the problem statement: $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.
  
However, a more critical issue is seen in the third example `(22, 4)`. The program would output `18`, but the correct steps involve reducing the side length from `22` to `4` through intermediate steps, not just subtracting `18`.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly and fails to meet the requirements for transforming the triangle as specified.
