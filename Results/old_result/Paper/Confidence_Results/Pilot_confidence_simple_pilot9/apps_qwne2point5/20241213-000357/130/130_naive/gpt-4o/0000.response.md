Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins one friend needs to gift to satisfy all the conditions described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - **Condition 1:** Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
   - **Condition 2:** All coins gifted must be different.
   - **Condition 3:** At least \(L\) coins must be new in Ivan's collection.

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The formula `(L + M - 1) // M` ensures that the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift is calculated such that when multiplied by \(M\), it is just enough to cover the requirement of at least \(L\) new coins.
   - If \(M \times \text{min\_x} \leq N - K\), it means that the total number of new coins can be covered within the available different coins.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the calculation fails to meet the condition (i.e., \(M \times \text{min\_x} > N - K\)), the program correctly outputs \(-1\).

Given the logic and the edge cases handled properly, the program works correctly for all potential inputs as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
