Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string. The logic in the program only increments the `operations` counter whenever a different character is encountered, which is not sufficient for calculating the minimum operations needed.

For example, consider the string `aaabba`. According to the problem description, the optimal way to delete this string would be to first delete `aaa` (1 operation), and then delete `b` and `b` (2 more operations), making a total of 3 operations. However, the current implementation would incorrectly count this as 4 operations because it increments `operations` each time it encounters a different character.

A counterexample where the program fails is the string `aaabba`, which should output `3` but the program outputs `4`.
