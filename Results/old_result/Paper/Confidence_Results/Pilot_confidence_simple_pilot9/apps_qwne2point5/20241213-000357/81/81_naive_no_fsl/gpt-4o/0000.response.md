Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of good pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y within the given range [l, r]. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Check if y is divisible by x**: The program first checks if `y % x == 0`. If not, it returns 0 immediately, which is correct since no pairs can satisfy the conditions if y is not divisible by x.

2. **Compute z**: It calculates `z = y // x`, which represents the product of the quotient and divisor needed to form the pairs.

3. **Iterate over possible factors of z**: For each factor `i` of `z`, it computes `a = i * x` and `b = z // i * x`.

4. **Validate the conditions**: It checks if both `a` and `b` are within the range `[l, r]`, if their GCD equals `x`, and if their LCM equals `y`.

5. **Count valid pairs**: If `a` and `b` are equal, it increments the count by 1 (since a pair is counted once). Otherwise, it increments the count by 2 (since pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are distinct).

Given this analysis, the program correctly handles all the provided examples and adheres to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
