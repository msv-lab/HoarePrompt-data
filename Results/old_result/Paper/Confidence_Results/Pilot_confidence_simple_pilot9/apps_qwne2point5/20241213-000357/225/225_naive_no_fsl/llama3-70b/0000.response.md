Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string consists entirely of consonants, or where the string ends with a vowel but the previous character is also a vowel. Specifically, the logic for updating `max_jump` when `last_vowel` is not the last index of the string needs to be adjusted.

For example, consider the input `EEA`. According to the problem description, the correct output should be `1`, as the Grasshopper can jump directly from the first 'E' to the second 'E'. However, the current implementation will incorrectly calculate the maximum jump as `2` because it does not correctly handle consecutive vowels.

To fix this, the logic should ensure that consecutive vowels are treated as a single jump if they are adjacent, and the jump length should be calculated based on the actual gap between the start and end of these consecutive vowels.
