Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly calculate the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to jump from the beginning of the string to the end, landing only on vowels. The logic in the `func_1` function iterates through the string, tracking the positions of vowels and updating the maximum jump length accordingly. This approach ensures that the program works for any valid input string within the specified constraints. Since the program handles all described cases correctly and there are no apparent edge cases that it fails to address, the program is correct.
