Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using a greedy approach to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution. The function `coverage(x, y)` calculates the coverage area for a given cell, but the main logic in `func_1` does not correctly place the fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

- Input: `3 3 2 3`
- Expected output: `2.0000000000`

In this case, placing the three fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3) would indeed result in an expected value of 2.0000000000, as each of the four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted in light green) would catch exactly two fishes.

However, the provided program does not guarantee this optimal placement. For instance, if we run the program with the given input, it might not place the fishes in the optimal locations, leading to a different (and potentially incorrect) expected value.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, making it incorrect.
