Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the largest integer in the sequence needs to be minimized and the sequence is lexicographically largest. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle cases where the binary representation of `n` has fewer bits than `k`, leading to incorrect results.

Consider the input:
```
17 4
```

The expected output should be:
```
Yes
4 2 1 0
```

However, the current implementation will output:
```
No
```

This is because the program checks if `len(bits) > k` and returns 'No' if true, which happens when the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` is less than `k`. However, this is not the correct approach. The correct approach would be to ensure that the sequence meets the criteria of having the minimum largest integer and being lexicographically largest.

To fix this, the program needs to adjust the logic to handle cases where the number of bits in `n` is less than `k` and fill the remaining positions with `-1` values, ensuring the sequence is lexicographically largest.
