Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the condition where there are no uppercase letters between the selected positions correctly. Specifically, the program does not reset the `current_set` and `current_count` when an uppercase letter is encountered. Instead, it simply updates the `max_count` and clears `current_set`, but it continues counting lowercase letters without ensuring that there are no uppercase letters between them.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
Input:
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output (Expected):
2

Output (Program Output):
1
```

The program fails to recognize that the positions 6 and 8 form a valid pretty set because there is an uppercase 'B' between them. The program only counts up to position 8 and then resets, missing the opportunity to count both positions 6 and 8 together. This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
