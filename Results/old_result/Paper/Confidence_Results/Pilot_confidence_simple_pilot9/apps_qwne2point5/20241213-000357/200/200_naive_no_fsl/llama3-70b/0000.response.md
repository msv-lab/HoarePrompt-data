Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the binary search approach used to determine the minimum amount of kvass in the least keg does not ensure that the total volume of kvass poured equals \(s\). 

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3 7
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

In this case, the program calculates a value of 2 for the minimum amount of kvass in the least keg but fails to check if it is possible to pour exactly 7 liters of kvass. The sum of the minimum values taken from each keg (1, 2, 3) is only 6, which is less than 7, making it impossible to achieve the desired volume. Therefore, the output should be `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to pour 7 liters of kvass.

The program needs to include a final check to ensure that the total volume of kvass poured is exactly equal to \(s\). If not, the program should output `-1`.
