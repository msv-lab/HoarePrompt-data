Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the operations and updates the number of stones in the pile accordingly, ensuring that the pile is never empty before a "take" operation. The program handles all possible cases where the operations are either "add" (+) or "take" (-). Since the program works for all given examples and the logic is sound, it is correct for every potential case.
