Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by simply swapping the positions of the empty cells ('X') between the two puzzles and then checking if the sorted versions of the resulting strings are equal. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the actual movements of the tiles, which is the core requirement of the problem.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
YES
```

In this case, the program will incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks if the sorted strings are equal after swapping the empty cells. However, no sequence of valid moves can transform the first puzzle (`AB\nXC`) into the second puzzle (`AC\nBX`).

The program fails to consider the constraints that tiles can only move to adjacent empty positions, and it does not simulate these moves. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration through valid moves.
