Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the given intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` using a custom GCD function (`func_1`). However, the approach is flawed because the LCM calculation based on the product of the numbers divided by their pairwise GCDs is incorrect for finding a common point in time where all garlands are lit.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following case:

**Input:**
```
2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

However, the program output is:
```
NO
```

This is incorrect because Mishka can choose `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 2`, and `x3 = 1`. In this scenario:
- The first garland will be lit at seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
- The second garland will be lit at seconds 2, 4, 6, 8, ...
- The third garland will be lit at seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ...

At any second greater than or equal to 2, at least one garland will be lit. Therefore, the program fails to correctly identify this valid configuration, resulting in a wrong answer.
