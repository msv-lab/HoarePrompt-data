Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three given time intervals is 1. If the GCD is 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to choose moments to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This approach works because if the GCD of the three time intervals is 1, it means that there exists a sequence of seconds such that each second will eventually be covered by at least one of the garlands being lit. This is due to the properties of numbers with a GCD of 1, ensuring that their least common multiple covers all integers.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to satisfy the condition for any given set of time intervals, and since the provided logic and examples match the problem description, the program is correct.
