Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The program iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) with a step of 2, checking if each element at these indices is odd. If any element is found to be even, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the iteration.

The program handles the following cases correctly based on the assertions:
1. `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: This list has odd numbers at all odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7).
2. `func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: This list also satisfies the condition since the only odd index (1) contains an odd number (1).
3. `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: This list fails the condition because the odd index (1) contains an even number (2).

Additionally, the logic within the loop ensures that if any even number is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

Given the provided test cases and the logical structure of the function, the program works correctly for the described problem and no counterexamples were found. Therefore, the program is correct.
