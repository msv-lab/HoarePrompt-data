Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from a list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. Based on the provided assertions:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]`: This is correct because 2 and 4 are the only even numbers in the list.
2. `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]) == [4, 6, 8, 0]`: This is correct because 4, 6, 8, and 0 are the even numbers in the list.
3. `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19]) == [8, 12]`: This is correct because 8 and 12 are the even numbers in the list.

Given these examples, the function appears to handle the task correctly for the provided cases. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or additional scenario that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
