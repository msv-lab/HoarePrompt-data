Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the angle (also known as the argument) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The function works correctly for all valid inputs because the `cmath.phase()` function handles the calculation of the angle for any non-zero complex number. For a zero complex number, the function returns `0` which is mathematically consistent with the angle of zero. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
