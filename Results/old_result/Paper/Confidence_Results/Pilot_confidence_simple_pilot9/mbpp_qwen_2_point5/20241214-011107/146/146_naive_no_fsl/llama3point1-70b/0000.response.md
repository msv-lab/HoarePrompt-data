Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program returns only the first sublist with the maximum length, but the problem description asks for a list of all sublists with the maximum length. For example, consider the following input:

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13]]
```

The maximum length is 4, and there is one sublist with this length: `[6, 7, 8, 9]`. However, the program will return `(4, [1, 2])` because it only selects the first sublist with the maximum length. This does not meet the requirement to return all sublists with the maximum length. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
