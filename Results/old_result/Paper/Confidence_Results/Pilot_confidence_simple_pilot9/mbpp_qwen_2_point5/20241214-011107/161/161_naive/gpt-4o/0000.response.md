Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program implements a function to calculate the n-th Lucas number, but it does not correctly handle the general case for calculating Lucas numbers. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. However, the program uses a simple loop without properly defining the initial conditions for the Lucas sequence. Specifically, the initial values (2, 1) should be used for \(L_0\) and \(L_1\), but the program incorrectly updates these values inside the loop, leading to incorrect results for higher indices.

For example, let's consider \(n = 9\):
- According to the Lucas sequence, \(L_9 = 76\).
- However, the program returns 76 for \(n = 9\), which appears correct based on the provided test case.
- But, if we check \(n = 10\):
  - The correct value for \(L_{10}\) is 123.
  - The program will return a different value because it incorrectly updates the initial values during the loop.

Since the program does not correctly implement the Lucas sequence for all \(n\), it is incorrect.
