Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the Lucas sequence. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- \( L(0) = 2 \)
- \( L(1) = 1 \)
- For \( n > 1 \), \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \)

The function handles the base cases \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \) correctly. For \( n > 1 \), it uses a loop to iteratively compute the Lucas numbers using the recurrence relation, which is consistent with the definition. Since the function works correctly for the base cases and the general case, it meets the requirements for finding the \( n \)-th Lucas number for any non-negative integer \( n \). Therefore, the program is correct.
