Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks for duplicates in an array by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. If there are no duplicates, all elements are unique and the lengths would be equal. If there are duplicates, the set will have fewer elements than the original array, making the lengths unequal. This logic correctly identifies the presence of duplicates for all potential cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in every case.
