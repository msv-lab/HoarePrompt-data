Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously and a generator expression to perform the subtraction. This approach ensures that the function works for tuples of any length, as long as they have the same length. Since the function correctly performs the operation for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
