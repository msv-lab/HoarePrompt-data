Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously and a generator expression to perform the subtraction. All the provided test cases (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function works as expected. Since the function handles tuples of equal length and performs element-wise subtraction correctly, and there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic, the program is correct.
