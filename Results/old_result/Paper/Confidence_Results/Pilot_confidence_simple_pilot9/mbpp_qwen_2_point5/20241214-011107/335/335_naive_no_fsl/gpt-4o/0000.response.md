Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle overlapping occurrences of the substring correctly. For example, consider the following case:

- Input: `func_1('aaabaaa', 'aaa')`
- Expected Output: The function should return `('aaa', 0, 3)` and then `('aaa', 3, 6)` because there are two overlapping occurrences of 'aaa' in the string.

However, the current implementation only returns the first occurrence and stops. Therefore, this case shows that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
