Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly merges and sorts the three input lists. The logic of combining the lists using `list1 + list2 + list3` followed by sorting the combined list using `sorted(combined_list)` ensures that the output is always a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists without duplicates. The test cases provided also confirm that the function works as expected for different inputs. Since no counterexample has been found where the program does not meet the requirement, the code is considered correct.
