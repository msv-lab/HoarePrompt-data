Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist. Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function works as expected. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This approach handles different lengths of sublists and multiple sublists correctly. Since the function passes the given assertions and no edge cases violate the described behavior, the program is correct.
