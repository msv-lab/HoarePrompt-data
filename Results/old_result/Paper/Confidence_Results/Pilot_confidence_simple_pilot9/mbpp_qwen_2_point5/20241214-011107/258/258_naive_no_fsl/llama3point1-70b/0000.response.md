Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and then checks if this sum is equal to the original number. This logic correctly identifies Armstrong numbers for any given input, making the program correct according to the problem description.
