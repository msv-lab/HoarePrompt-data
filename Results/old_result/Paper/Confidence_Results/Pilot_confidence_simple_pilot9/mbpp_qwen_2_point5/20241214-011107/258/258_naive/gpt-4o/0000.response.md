Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a given number is an Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits). The code correctly implements this logic by converting the number to a string, calculating the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits, and comparing this sum to the original number. The provided test cases also validate this implementation:

- `func_1(153)` returns `True` because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` because \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259\).
- `func_1(4458)` returns `False` because \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458\).

Since the program correctly handles these cases and the logic is sound for any positive integer, the program meets the requirements for checking Armstrong numbers.
