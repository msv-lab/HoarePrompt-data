Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order, ignoring case. The `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. This implementation handles all potential cases as per the problem description, meaning it will work correctly for any input of lists containing strings. Therefore, no specific counterexample can be found where this function fails to meet the requirements.
