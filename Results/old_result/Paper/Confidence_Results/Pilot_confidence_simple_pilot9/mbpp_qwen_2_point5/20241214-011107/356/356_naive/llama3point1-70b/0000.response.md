Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. Since the problem description asks to remove all whitespaces, this function satisfies the requirement for any input string. There are no edge cases or inputs where this function would fail to meet the description. Therefore, the function is correct.
