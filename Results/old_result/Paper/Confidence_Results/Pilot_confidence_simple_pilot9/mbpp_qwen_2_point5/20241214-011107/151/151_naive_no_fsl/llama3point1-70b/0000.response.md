Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. It recursively processes each element in the input list. If an element is a list, it calls itself (recursively) to flatten that sublist and extends the current list with the result. If an element is not a list, it appends the element directly to the current list. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their depth in the nested structure, are added to the final flat list. Since the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, it is correct.
