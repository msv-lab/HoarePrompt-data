Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the occurrences of the substring 'std'. This approach correctly counts the number of times 'std' appears in the input string. The test cases provided cover various scenarios including empty strings and strings with multiple occurrences of 'std'. Since the function behaves as expected for these cases and the `count` method handles all edge cases (such as overlapping substrings), the function is correct for every potential case.
