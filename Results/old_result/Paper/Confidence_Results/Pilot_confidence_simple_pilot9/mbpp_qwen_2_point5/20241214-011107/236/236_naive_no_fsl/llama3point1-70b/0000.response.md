Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1(nums)` checks if the input list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version using `sorted(nums)`. This approach works correctly for all potential cases. Since the comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will only be `True` if the original list is already sorted (either in ascending or descending order, depending on the sorting used), the function will accurately determine whether the list is sorted. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided problem description.
