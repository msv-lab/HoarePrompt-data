Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the converted tuple to a list. This implementation correctly follows the problem description for any given list and tuple. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as the inputs are valid (i.e., the first argument is a list and the second is a tuple).
