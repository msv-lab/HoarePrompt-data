Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly calculate the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's break down the logic:

1. It generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
2. It calculates the cube sum of these numbers using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
3. The assertions provided (`func_1(2) == 72`, `func_1(3) == 288`, `func_1(4) == 800`) confirm the correctness of the function for these specific cases.

To ensure the function works for every potential case, let's consider a few more test cases:
- For `n = 1`, the first even number is 2, and the cube sum is \(2^3 = 8\).
- For `n = 5`, the first five even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and the cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 + 10^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 + 1000 = 1800\).

The function correctly handles these cases as well. Since the provided function and the assertions cover multiple cases, and no specific edge cases are mentioned that would cause the function to fail, we can conclude that the function is correct.
