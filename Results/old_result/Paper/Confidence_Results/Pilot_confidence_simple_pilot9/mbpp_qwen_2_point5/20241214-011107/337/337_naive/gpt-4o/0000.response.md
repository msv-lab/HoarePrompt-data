Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses `sum(set(lst))` to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. This approach is correct because:

- Converting the list to a set removes all duplicate elements, ensuring only non-repeated elements are included.
- Summing the set then gives the sum of these unique elements.

Given the test cases:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` returns `21`, which is the sum of `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.
- `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` returns `71`, which is the sum of `{1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 45, 4}`.
- `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` returns `78`, which is the sum of `{12, 10, 9, 45, 2}`.

The function works correctly for these test cases and logically handles the requirement of summing non-repeated elements. There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the provided examples and problem description.
