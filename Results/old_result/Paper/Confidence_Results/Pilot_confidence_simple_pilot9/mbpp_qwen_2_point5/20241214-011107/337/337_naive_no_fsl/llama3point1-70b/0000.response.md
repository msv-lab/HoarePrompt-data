Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. For any list, the function uses a generator expression to filter out elements that appear more than once using `lst.count(i) == 1`, and then sums these unique elements. This logic aligns with the problem description, which asks for the sum of non-repeated elements. Since the function handles all elements in the list and correctly excludes repeated elements, it works as expected for any potential input.
