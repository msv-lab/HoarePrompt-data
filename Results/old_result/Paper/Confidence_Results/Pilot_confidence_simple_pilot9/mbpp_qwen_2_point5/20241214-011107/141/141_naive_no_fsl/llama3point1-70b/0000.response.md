Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Convert the integer `n` to a string `str_n` to easily iterate over each digit.
2. For each digit in `str_n`, count its occurrences using `str_n.count(digit)`.
3. Compare the count with the digit (converted to an integer).
4. If any digit has a count greater than its value, return `False`.
5. If no such digit is found, return `True`.

This logic ensures that the function works correctly for all cases. Here are a few test cases to illustrate:

- For `n = 321`, the digits are 3, 2, and 1. The counts are 1, 1, and 1 respectively. Since 1 ≤ 3, 1 ≤ 2, and 1 ≤ 1, the function returns `True`.
- For `n = 324000`, the digits are 3, 2, 4, and 0. The counts are 1, 1, 1, and 3 respectively. Since 1 ≤ 3, 1 ≤ 2, 1 ≤ 4, and 3 ≤ 0 is false (considering the count of '0' which is 3), the function returns `False`.

Since the function handles all potential cases as described, the correctness is `True`.
