Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND (`&`) operation between elements of the two tuples, which is not consistent with the problem description. The problem description asks to extract elements from the tuples, but the code performs a bitwise AND operation instead. For example, if we consider the input tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected output would be a tuple containing the elements themselves, not the result of the bitwise AND operation. 

The correct implementation should simply return the input tuples as they are:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple1, tuple2
```

This version would meet the problem description and handle all potential cases correctly.
