Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program iterates through each sublist in the list of lists, calculates the sum of elements in each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. This approach ensures that the function will return the correct sublist regardless of the input provided, as long as the input follows the expected format (a list of lists where each element is a list of integers).

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. A list with multiple sublists of varying sums.
2. A list with sublists of similar sizes but different sums.
3. A list with a single sublist.

Since the function correctly handles these cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct for every potential case.
