Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string in all potential cases. 

- If the character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string, which is correct.
- If the first and last occurrences of the character are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), the function correctly removes this single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
- If the first and last occurrences of the character are different, the function constructs a new string that excludes these two occurrences, which is also correct.

Since the function handles all described scenarios without any issues, it is considered correct.
