Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements from the given two lists by converting them into sets and then performing an intersection operation. The result is then converted back into a sorted tuple. This approach ensures that all common elements are found, regardless of their order in the original lists. Given the provided test cases and the nature of the solution, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly.
