Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The function uses sets to efficiently compute the intersection of the two lists and then converts the result back into a tuple. 

Given the assertions:
1. `func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)`
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)`
3. `func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)`

The function works correctly for these cases. To further validate, let's consider additional potential cases:

- If both lists are empty: `func_1([], [])` should return `()`.
- If there are no common elements: `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` should return `()`.
- If one or both lists contain duplicates: `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), (2, 3, 3, 4))` should return `(2, 3)`.

In all these cases, the function handles them correctly, ensuring that it only returns the common elements in a sorted tuple form. Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description.
