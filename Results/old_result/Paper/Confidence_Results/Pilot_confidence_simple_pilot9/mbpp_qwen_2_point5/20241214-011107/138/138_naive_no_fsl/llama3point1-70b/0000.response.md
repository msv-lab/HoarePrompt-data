Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It searches for the given `element` in the `array`. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the element in the array. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns `(False, -1)`. This covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or examples where this function would fail to meet the requirements.
