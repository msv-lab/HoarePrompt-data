Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `index` method to find the first occurrence of the element in the array, which returns the index if the element is found or raises a `ValueError` if the element is not present. The program handles both cases by returning a tuple `(True, index)` if the element is found and `(False, -1)` if the element is not found. This approach works for all potential cases as per the problem description.
