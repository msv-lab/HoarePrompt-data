Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The function takes `radius` and `height` as inputs and returns the calculated volume. Since the function correctly follows the mathematical formula for the volume of a cone and there are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the problem description, the program is correct.
