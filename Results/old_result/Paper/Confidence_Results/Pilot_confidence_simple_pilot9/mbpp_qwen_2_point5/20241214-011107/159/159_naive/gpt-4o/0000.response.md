Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The given test cases also correctly use `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance to verify the results. Since the program follows the problem description accurately and the provided test cases do not reveal any issues, the program is correct for all the cases we can verify.
