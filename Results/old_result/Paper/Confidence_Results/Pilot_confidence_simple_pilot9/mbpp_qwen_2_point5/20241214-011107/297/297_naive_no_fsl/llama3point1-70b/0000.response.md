Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. This matches the problem description exactly. For any tuple `(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function will produce a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element is `t_i * t_{i+1}`. Since the function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`, it correctly pairs each element with its successor for multiplication. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
