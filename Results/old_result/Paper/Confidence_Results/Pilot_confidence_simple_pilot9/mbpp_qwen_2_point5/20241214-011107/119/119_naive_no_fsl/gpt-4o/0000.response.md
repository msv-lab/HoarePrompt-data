Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly swaps the order of the two input numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The assertions provided in the code cover a few test cases, and the function logic is straightforward:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)
```

This function will always return a tuple where the second element is the original first number (`b`) and the first element is the original second number (`a`). Since the provided function meets the requirements for the given test cases and the logic is simple and reliable, it is correct for the described problem.
