Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with `b` followed by `a`. This exactly matches the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs where this function would fail to meet the requirements since it simply swaps the order of the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple. Therefore, the program is correct.
