Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days. It uses a set of month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the given month is in that set, and `False` otherwise. Based on the problem description and the provided test cases, the function works correctly for all the potential cases mentioned (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). Since there are no other months with 31 days and the function handles all the provided examples correctly, the function is correct.
