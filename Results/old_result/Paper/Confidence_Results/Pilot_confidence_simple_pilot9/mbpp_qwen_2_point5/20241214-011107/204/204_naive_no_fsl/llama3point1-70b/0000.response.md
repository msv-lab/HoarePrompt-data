Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly checks if a given month number contains 31 days. The function uses a list of month numbers that have 31 days and returns `True` if the input month number `n` is in this list, and `False` otherwise. This matches the problem description perfectly, as it correctly identifies months with 31 days without missing any or including any months without 31 days. There are no potential cases found where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
