Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element using the `all()` function. The expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a generator that yields `True` for each item in the list that matches the given element, and `all()` returns `True` only if all elements in the generator are `True`. This means that if all items in the list are equal to the given element, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where this implementation would fail to meet the problem description.
