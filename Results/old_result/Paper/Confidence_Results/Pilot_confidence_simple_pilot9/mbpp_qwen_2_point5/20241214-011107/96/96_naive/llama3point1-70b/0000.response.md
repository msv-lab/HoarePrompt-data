Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set comprehension to collect the types of all elements in the tuple. If all elements have the same data type, the set will contain only one unique type, and the length of the set will be 1. This approach works for all potential cases where the elements in the tuple have the same data type. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the function correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type in every case.
