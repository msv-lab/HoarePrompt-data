Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined as the sum of the natural numbers up to a certain point, and the formula for the `k`-th triangular number is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The program iterates through the indices, calculating the corresponding triangular numbers until it finds one with at least `n` digits. This approach is sound and works for any positive integer `n`.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits for any valid input `n`, and there are no apparent edge cases or errors, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
