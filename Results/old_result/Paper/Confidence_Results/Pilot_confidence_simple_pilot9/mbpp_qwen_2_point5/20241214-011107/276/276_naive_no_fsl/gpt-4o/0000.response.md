Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts them, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. Since the problem description specifies that the lists are already sorted and of the same size, the function handles this scenario accurately. The test cases provided also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, there are no potential cases found where the program does not meet the requirements.
