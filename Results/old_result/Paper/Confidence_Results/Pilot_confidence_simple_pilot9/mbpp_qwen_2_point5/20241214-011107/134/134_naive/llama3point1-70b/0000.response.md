Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program attempts to calculate the sum of even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. However, there is a logical error in the loop condition. The loop iterates from `0` to `n`, but it should include the case where `i` is equal to `n`. This means the loop should run until `i <= n`.

To fix this, the loop condition should be `range(n + 1)` instead of just `range(n)`. Without this correction, the program will miss the last term in the binomial expansion, which is the coefficient at index `n`.

For example, if `n = 4`, the even indices are `0`, `2`, and `4`. The program should include the term `math.comb(4, 4)`, but it currently does not because the loop does not reach `i = 4`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):  # Corrected the loop condition
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
    return sum
```

With this correction, the program will correctly compute the sum of even-index binomial coefficients for any given positive integer `n`.
