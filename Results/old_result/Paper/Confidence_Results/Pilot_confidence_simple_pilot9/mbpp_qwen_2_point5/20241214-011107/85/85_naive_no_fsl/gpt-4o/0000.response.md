Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and returns their difference. This approach works for any array of integers, including arrays with negative numbers, zero, or repeated values. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, such as arrays with increasing and decreasing sequences, and an array with three elements. Since the function handles these cases correctly and the logic is sound, the program is correct for every potential case within the problem description.
