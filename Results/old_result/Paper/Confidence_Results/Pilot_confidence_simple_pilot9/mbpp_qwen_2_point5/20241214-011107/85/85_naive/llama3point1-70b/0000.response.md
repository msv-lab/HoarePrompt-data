Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach works for all possible cases where the array contains at least two elements. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios that this function would fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
