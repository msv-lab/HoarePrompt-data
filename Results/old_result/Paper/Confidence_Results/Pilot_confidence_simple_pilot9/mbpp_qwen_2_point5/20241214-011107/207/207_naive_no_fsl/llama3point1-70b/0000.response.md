Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, and this function satisfies that requirement for all potential cases where both length and width are provided. Since the function works correctly for all such cases, the correctness is True.
