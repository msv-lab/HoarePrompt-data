Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts based on the given integer L. The first part contains the first L elements of the list, and the second part contains the remaining elements. This approach works for all potential cases, including edge cases like when L is 0, L is equal to the length of the list, or L is greater than the length of the list. Here are some test cases:

- For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `L = 2`, the result should be `([1, 2], [3, 4, 5])`.
- For `lst = []` and `L = 0`, the result should be `([], [])`.
- For `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `L = 3`, the result should be `([1, 2, 3], [])`.
- For `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `L = 4`, the result should be `([1, 2, 3], [])`.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected, so the program is correct.
