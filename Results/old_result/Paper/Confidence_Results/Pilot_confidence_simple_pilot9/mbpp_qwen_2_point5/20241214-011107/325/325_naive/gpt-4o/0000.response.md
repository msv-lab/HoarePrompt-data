Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The set `months_with_30_days` contains the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) which have 30 days. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise. 

To verify this, let's consider all possible month numbers from 1 to 12:

- For month 4, the function returns `True` (correct).
- For month 2, the function returns `False` (correct).
- For month 12, the function returns `False` (correct).

The program handles all the potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
