Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the given list of tuples. The function iterates through each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position from all tuples, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The implementation handles all provided test cases correctly and seems to work for any valid input following the problem description. Since no specific edge cases or inputs were provided that would cause the function to fail, we can conclude that the function is correct.
