Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string to iterate over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. This approach correctly calculates the sum of the digits of the given non-negative integer for all potential cases. Since the function handles the conversion and summation correctly and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that this function would fail to handle, the program is correct.
