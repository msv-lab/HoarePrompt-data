Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with all elements of the second list. The assertions provided in the example demonstrate this functionality for various inputs:

1. `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]` (first list) and `[2, 4, 6, 8]` (second list) results in `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.
2. `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (first list) and `[5, 6, 7, 8]` results in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
3. `['red', 'blue', 'green']` (first list) and `['yellow']` (second list) results in `['red', 'blue', 'yellow']`.

Since the function behaves as expected for all given examples and there are no potential edge cases mentioned in the problem description that would cause the function to fail, the program is correct.
