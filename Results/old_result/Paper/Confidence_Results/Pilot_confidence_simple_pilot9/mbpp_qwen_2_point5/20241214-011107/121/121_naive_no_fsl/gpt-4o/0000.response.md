Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly generate the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. Instead, it appears to be implementing a recurrence relation based on the Lucas sequence, which does not directly correspond to the definition of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are related to the sequence defined by \(P_n = 2P_{n-1}^2 - P_{n-2}\) with initial values \(P_0 = 0\) and \(P_1 = 1\), but the output is not necessarily prime numbers.

To verify this, consider the first few Newman–Shanks–Williams primes:
- \(P_0 = 2^{0^2} - 1 = 0\)
- \(P_1 = 2^{1^2} - 1 = 1\)
- \(P_2 = 2 \cdot 1^2 - 0 = 2\)
- \(P_3 = 2 \cdot 2^2 - 1 = 7\)
- \(P_4 = 2 \cdot 7^2 - 2 = 96\)

The function returns 17 for `n=4`, which is not a Newman–Shanks–Williams prime (the correct value should be 96 according to the recurrence relation). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for generating Newman–Shanks–Williams primes and hence is incorrect.
