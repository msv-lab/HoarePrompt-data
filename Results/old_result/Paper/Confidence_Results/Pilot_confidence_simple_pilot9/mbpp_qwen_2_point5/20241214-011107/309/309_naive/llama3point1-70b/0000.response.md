Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This approach correctly identifies strings with all identical characters, including empty strings and strings with only one unique character. Since the function works for all potential cases, it satisfies the problem description accurately.
