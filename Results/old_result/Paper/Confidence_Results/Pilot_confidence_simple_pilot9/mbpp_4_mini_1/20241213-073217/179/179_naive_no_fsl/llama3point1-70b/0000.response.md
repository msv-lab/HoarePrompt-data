To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description and potential edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The first `n` even natural numbers are `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1(n)` calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers using the comprehension:
```python
sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```
This line creates a generator that cubes each even number from `2` to `2n` (inclusive). The generator correctly iterates through the even numbers because:
- `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates: `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **n = 0**: The description does not specify the behavior for `n = 0`. The first `0` even natural numbers would imply that the sum is `0`. The program should also return `0` in this case. 
2. **Negative n**: The program does not handle negative values for `n`. The behavior for negative `n` is ambiguous, and an appropriate response (like returning `0` or raising an error) should be defined.

To summarize:
- For `n = 0`: The correct output is `0`, which the code would return.
- For `n < 0`: The function does not specify behavior, and Python would return `0` due to an empty range, but logically it could be considered incorrect due to lack of handling.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the program is potentially incorrect due to:
- Lack of clear handling for negative values of `n`.

Thus, the final judgment on the correctness is:

Correctness: **False** 

The function does return a correct value for `n = 0` but does not handle negative inputs properly.
