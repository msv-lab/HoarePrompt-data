To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description to "remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string," let's analyze the provided code.

The function `func_1` is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join((s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the string `s` with a step of 2, starting from index 0. This means it selects characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which matches the requirement of "removing characters which have odd index values."

2. For example:
   - For the input string `"abcdef"`, the even indexed characters are `a`, `c`, and `e`, leading to the return value `"ace"`.
   - For the empty string `""`, the return is also `""`, which is consistent with the requirement.
   - For a single-character string like `"a"`, the return value will be `"a"` as index 0 is even.

### Edge Cases:
- An empty string should return an empty string.
- A single-character string should return that character.
- A string with even and odd lengths should return the characters at the even indices correctly.

After examining various cases, it is clear that for all possible inputs, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. There are no edge cases where it fails to meet the requirements to remove characters at odd index values.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct as it fulfills all the specified requirements for any potential case involving the removal of characters at odd indices from a string.
