Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is designed to remove characters from a given string that have odd indices. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through the string, checking whether the index `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`). It then joins and returns the characters at even indices, which matches the requirement of removing characters at odd index values.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the test cases provided:

1. `func_1('abcdef')` returns `'ace'`: 
   - Indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 correspond to characters `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`. Removing characters at odd indices (`b`, `d`, `f`) leaves `ace`.
   
2. `func_1('python')` returns `'pto'`: 
   - Indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 correspond to characters `p`, `y`, `t`, `h`, `o`, `n`. Removing characters at odd indices (`y`, `h`, `n`) leaves `pto`.
   
3. `func_1('data')` returns `'dt'`: 
   - Indices 0, 1, 2, 3 correspond to characters `d`, `a`, `t`, `a`. Removing characters at odd indices (`a`, `a`) leaves `dt`.

4. `func_1('lambs')` returns `'lms'`: 
   - Indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 correspond to characters `l`, `a`, `m`, `b`, `s`. Removing characters at odd indices (`a`, `b`) leaves `lms`.

The implementation passes all provided test cases, and I cannot find any other scenario where it would fail to meet the requirement of removing characters at odd indices from any string input. Thus, the implementation is correct.
