Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if the parity of a given integer `n` is odd. It does so by evaluating the expression `n % 2 != 0`, which will return `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., when the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not zero) and `False` otherwise. 

There are no edge cases or inputs for which this logic failsâ€”positive, negative, and zero values are all handled appropriately:

- For odd numbers like `1`, `3`, `-1`, `-3`, the function returns `True`.
- For even numbers like `0`, `2`, `4`, `-2`, `-4`, it returns `False`.

Thus, the program meets all requirements of the problem description without any issues.
