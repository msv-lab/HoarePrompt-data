Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of the given number \( n \) is odd. It returns `True` if \( n \) is odd (i.e., when \( n \% 2 \neq 0 \)) and `False` if \( n \) is even (i.e., when \( n \% 2 = 0 \)). The assertions provided are also correct and cover both even and odd cases.

- For `func_1(12)`, which is an even number, it correctly returns `False`.
- For `func_1(7)`, which is an odd number, it correctly returns `True`.
- For `func_1(10)`, which is an even number, it correctly returns `False`.

The logic handles all relevant cases for determining the parity of integers. Thus, since no edge cases are overlooked and the function's behavior aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
