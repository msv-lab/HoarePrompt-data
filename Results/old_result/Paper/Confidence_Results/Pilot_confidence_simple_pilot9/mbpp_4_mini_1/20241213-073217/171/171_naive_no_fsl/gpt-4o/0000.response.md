Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of the given number `n` is odd. It does this by checking if `n % 2` is not equal to 0, which indicates that `n` is odd. 

The assertions provided in the program confirm this:

- For `n = 12`: `12 % 2` equals `0`, so the function returns `False`. This is correct since 12 is even.
- For `n = 7`: `7 % 2` equals `1`, so the function returns `True`. This is correct since 7 is odd.
- For `n = 10`: `10 % 2` equals `0`, so the function returns `False`. This is correct since 10 is even.

Since these cases cover both even and odd numbers and the logic in the function is sound, I cannot find any potential cases or inputs where the function would not behave as expected. Thus, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
