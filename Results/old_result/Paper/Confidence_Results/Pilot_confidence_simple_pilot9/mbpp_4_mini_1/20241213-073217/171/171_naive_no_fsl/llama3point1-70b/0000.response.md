Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. It checks if `n` modulo 2 is not equal to 0, which is the correct way to evaluate the oddness of a number.

1. If `n` is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5), `n % 2` will equal 1 and `n % 2 != 0` will evaluate to `True`.
2. If `n` is even (e.g., 0, 2, 4), `n % 2` will equal 0 and `n % 2 != 0` will evaluate to `False`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including negative numbers. For example:
- `func_1(-1)` returns `True` (since -1 is odd)
- `func_1(-2)` returns `False` (since -2 is even)

Since the logic covers all integers and accurately identifies odd numbers, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
