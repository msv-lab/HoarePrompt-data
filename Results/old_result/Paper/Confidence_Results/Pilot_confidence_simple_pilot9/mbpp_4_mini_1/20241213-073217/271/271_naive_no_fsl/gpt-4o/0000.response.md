To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will examine the function `func_1`. The function is supposed to take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

Let's analyze the implementation:

1. **Input Structure:** The input is a tuple of tuples. Each inner tuple can represent a series of values.
2. **Averaging Logic:** The function extracts the number of elements in the first inner tuple to determine how many positions there are. It iterates through each position, collects the values from each tuple at that position, then computes the average by summing these values and dividing by the number of tuples.

### Considerations:
- The function assumes that all inner tuples are of the same length, as it directly accesses `t[i]` for each tuple in `tuples`. If the inner tuples are of different lengths, it will raise an `IndexError`.
- The function also does not handle empty input. If the input tuple is empty, it will also raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `tuples[0]`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
To confirm this analysis, let's consider various edge cases:

- **Case with Different Lengths:**
  ```python
  func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))  # This will raise an IndexError.
  ```

- **Empty Input Case:**
  ```python
  func_1(())  # This will raise an IndexError.
  ```

Given the above potential cases, the program does not account for scenarios involving empty tuples or tuples having varying lengths, leading to possible runtime errors.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to handle specific edge cases and does not produce correct behavior under all potential input configurations, the correctness of the function is ultimately questionable.

Correctness: **False**
