Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the average of values from the tuples at each corresponding position. By utilizing `zip(*tuples)`, it effectively transposes the tuples, allowing the sums of the corresponding elements to be calculated correctly. The division by `len(tuples)` accurately computes the average for each position. 

Here are a few scenarios confirming its correctness:
1. For the input `((1, 2), (3, 4))`, it computes averages `[2.0, 3.0]`, which are correct.
2. For a case with negative values, like `((-1, -2), (-3, -4))`, it correctly returns `[-2.0, -3.0]`.
3. Extending to a case with a single tuple, like `((5, 6, 7),)`, it returns `[5.0, 6.0, 7.0]` which is the average of individual elements.

Overall, the implementation and logic cover potential edge cases and perform as expected according to the problem description.
