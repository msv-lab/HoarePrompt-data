Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality of calculating the angle (phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. It uses the `cmath.phase` function, which accurately computes the angle in radians based on the input complex number. 

All potential cases are handled properly by the program:
1. When both real and imaginary parts are zero, the phase is correctly defined to be zero.
2. For any complex number in a specific quadrant of the complex plane, `cmath.phase` will return the correct angle in radians.

Since I cannot find an example that demonstrates the program failing to meet the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
