Correctness: **True**.

The provided program takes a list of lists of strings and sorts each sublist while ignoring case sensitivity, using `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)`. This adheres to the problem description.

To check its correctness, consider the following edge cases:
1. If a sublist contains mixed-case strings, the function sorts them case-insensitively, ensuring that "apple" and "Apple" will be treated as equal in terms of sorting order.
2. If a sublist is empty, the function correctly returns an empty sublist.
3. If the main list itself is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list.

The function will handle these cases as expected, providing correct results for various inputs of string lists. Therefore, it satisfies the requirements set forth in the problem description.
