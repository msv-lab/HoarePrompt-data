Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the scenario of sorting lists of strings that contain leading or trailing spaces. For example, consider the input:

```python
[[' orange', 'apple'], [' banana ', 'cherry']]
```

The expected output should be:

```
[[' apple', ' orange'], [' banana ', 'cherry']]
```

However, the program will sort the elements based on the Unicode values of the strings, leading to incorrect ordering due to space characters. Hence, this input case demonstrates that the program does not work as expected.
