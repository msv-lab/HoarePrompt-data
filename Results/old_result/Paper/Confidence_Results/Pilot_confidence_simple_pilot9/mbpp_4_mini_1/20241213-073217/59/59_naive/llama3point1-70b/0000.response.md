Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly combines the three input lists into one and sorts them. It uses the `sorted()` function on the concatenated lists, which handles the sorting appropriately, ensuring that elements are arranged in ascending order. It effectively manages various cases, including empty lists and lists with different types of elements, assuming they are all of a compatible type that can be compared with each other. Thus, the function meets the problem description criteria.
