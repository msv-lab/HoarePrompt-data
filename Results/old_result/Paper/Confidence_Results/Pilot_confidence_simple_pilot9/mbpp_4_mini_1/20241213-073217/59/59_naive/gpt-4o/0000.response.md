Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The implementation first combines the three input lists into one and then sorts the combined list using the built-in `sorted()` function. 

1. **Combining Lists**: The operation `combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3` concatenates all three lists.
2. **Sorting the Combined List**: The `sorted(combined_list)` function returns a new list containing all elements of the combined list in ascending order.

The test cases provided check for various scenarios, including duplicates and varying element distributions, and the function produces the correct outputs for those cases. Since there are no identified edge cases or missing logic in the function, it fulfills the problem description completely.
