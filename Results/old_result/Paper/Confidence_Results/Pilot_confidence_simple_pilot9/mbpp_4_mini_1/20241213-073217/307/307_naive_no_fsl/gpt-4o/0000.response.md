To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program and ensure it meets all requirements.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number for index `k` is calculated using the formula:
\[ T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \]

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided function `func_1(n)` is designed to:
1. Initialize a variable `k` to 1.
2. In a loop, calculate the triangular number `T_k`.
3. Check if the number of digits in `T_k` matches `n`.
4. Return the index `k` as soon as it finds the first triangular number with exactly `n` digits.

Here are the assertions provided:
- `func_1(2) == 4`: The fourth triangular number (\(T_4 = 10\)) is the first with 2 digits.
- `func_1(3) == 14`: The fourteenth triangular number (\(T_{14} = 105\)) is the first with 3 digits.
- `func_1(4) == 45`: The forty-fifth triangular number (\(T_{45} = 1035\)) is the first with 4 digits.

### Testing for Edge Cases:
- For `n = 1`: The smallest triangular number is \(T_1 = 1\), which has 1 digit. Thus, `func_1(1)` should return 1.
- The program seems to correctly identify triangular numbers based on their digit count. 

### Additional Check:
Now let's check some values to ensure all potential cases are handled:
- Check for `n = 5`: The first triangular number with 5 digits is \(T_{141} = 10011\), so `func_1(5)` should return 141.
  
The function will continue checking until it finds the first triangular number meeting the digit criteria, so it seems mathematically sound.

### Conclusion:
Upon examination, the program logic appears to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits based on the provided formula and takes into consideration all cases without missing any logic.

Hence, I cannot find a potential case where the program does not fulfill the problem requirements. 

Correctness: **True**
