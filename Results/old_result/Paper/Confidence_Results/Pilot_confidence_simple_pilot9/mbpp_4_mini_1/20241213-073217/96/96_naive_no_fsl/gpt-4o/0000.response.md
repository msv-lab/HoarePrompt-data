Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where an empty tuple is passed as an argument correctly according to the problem description. 

According to the description, the function should check if "all the elements in a tuple have the same data type." However, the implementation returns `True` for an empty tuple, which could be considered incorrect based on the interpretation of "all elements" as equivalent to "no elements."

For example:

```python
assert func_1(()) == False  # This should lead to a False since there are no elements to compare types
```

As a result, since it does not meet the criteria for every potential input case, the overall correctness of the program is **False**.
