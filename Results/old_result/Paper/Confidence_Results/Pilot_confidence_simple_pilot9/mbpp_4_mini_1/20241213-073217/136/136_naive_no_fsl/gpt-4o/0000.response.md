Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly filters the input dictionary based on the specified integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the entries (key-value pairs) where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

Let's break down the functionality:

1. The program uses dictionary comprehension to iterate over each item in the provided dictionary `d`.
2. It checks the condition `v >= n` for each value `v` associated with each key `k`.
3. It constructs a new dictionary with only those key-value pairs where the value satisfies the condition.

The provided test assertions show that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Additionally:
- If `n` is greater than all values in the dictionary, it will return an empty dictionary, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.
- If `n` is less than or equal to all values, it will return the entire dictionary, which is also correct.

Since I cannot think of a case where the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, the code is correct.
