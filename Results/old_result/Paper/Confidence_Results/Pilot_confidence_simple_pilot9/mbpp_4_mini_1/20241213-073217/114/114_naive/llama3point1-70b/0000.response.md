Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of a specified element in a tuple by using the built-in `count` method. It will correctly handle tuples of any size, including empty tuples, and will return `0` if the element is not present. Given this functionality, there aren't any edge cases that the implementation fails to address as it adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.
