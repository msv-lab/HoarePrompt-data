To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate the function `func_1(radius, height)` for the inputs described.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cone is:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
   \]

2. **Analyzing the Code**: The function `func_1` is implemented as follows:
   ```python
   def func_1(radius, height):
       return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
   ```
   This correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone. The assertions provided in the code check specific cases. 

3. **Checking Edge Cases**: Besides the provided test cases, we should consider edge cases:
   - **Zero Values**: If either the radius or the height is zero, the volume should be zero, as a cone with zero dimensions cannot have any volume.
     - Example: `func_1(0, 5)` should return `0`, since the radius is zero.
     - Example: `func_1(5, 0)` should also return `0`, since the height is zero.
   - **Negative Values**: The function does not handle negative values for radius or height, and mathematically, negative dimensions do not make sense in this context.
     - Example: `func_1(-5, 10)` would produce a volume of a negative cone, which is not valid.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the function does not handle cases where the radius or height is zero or negative, it will not behave as expected for these potential cases.

Therefore, the overall assessment of the code is:

Correctness: **False**

The code fails to correctly handle edge cases such as radius or height being zero or negative, which is crucial for the correctness of the implementation.
