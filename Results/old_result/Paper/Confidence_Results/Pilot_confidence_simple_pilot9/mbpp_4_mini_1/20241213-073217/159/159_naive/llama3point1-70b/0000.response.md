Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly implements the formula to calculate the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]

In the code:
- `radius` and `height` are expected to be non-negative values. The function uses `math.pi` to accurately represent Ï€. 
- The computation `1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height` correctly follows the mathematical formula for volume.

No edge cases or conditions of failure related to the problem description were identified, so the function should yield correct results for all valid inputs like `radius >= 0` and `height >= 0`.
