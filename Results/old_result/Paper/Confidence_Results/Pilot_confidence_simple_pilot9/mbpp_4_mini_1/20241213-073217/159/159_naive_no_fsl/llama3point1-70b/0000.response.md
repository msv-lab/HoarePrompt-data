Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

Where:
- \( V \) is the volume,
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone,
- \( h \) is the height of the cone.

The program uses the `math.pi` constant for the value of Ï€, ensuring accuracy. 

Here are the considerations:
- The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both are expected to be non-negative real numbers for the volume to make sense since negative dimensions do not have a physical representation in this context.
- The formula is correctly implemented in the return statement of the function.

Given these details, I can't think of any potential cases where the code fails to meet the specified problem of calculating the cone's volume accurately as long as the inputs are valid (non-negative). 

In summary, the code correctly follows the problem description for all reasonable inputs, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.
