To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code implementation.

**Problem Description**: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

**Program**:
```python
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

### Analysis:
1. The program initializes a list `result` containing `n` empty sublists.
2. It then iterates through each element in the input list `lst` with its index `i`. The element is added to the sublist at index `i % n` in the `result`. This effectively distributes elements into `n` groups based on their indices.

### Verification of Examples:
- For the input `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` and `n=3`, the output is `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`. This is correct.
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]` and `n=3`, the output is `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`. This is also correct.
- For the input `['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL']` and `n=2`, the output is `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`. This matches the expected output as well.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: If `lst` is empty, the output should be `[[]]` if `n` is greater than zero, which is indeed what the program returns since it initializes `result` with `n` empty lists before the loop.
2. **n greater than length of lst**: If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the program would still produce `n` sublists, but the first few will be empty, which is the expected behavior.
3. **n equals 0**: The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0, which would raise a division/modulo by zero error during the `i % n` computation.
4. **Negative n**: The function also does not handle negative values for `n`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to handle the cases where `n` is 0 or negative, we have established that there are certain input scenarios leading to errors.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function is incorrect because it does not account for cases where `n` is 0 or negative, which would cause a runtime error (division by zero).
