To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the behavior of the `func_1` function and the specific examples given.

The problem description requires the function to take a list and an integer `n`, splitting the list into sublists for every nth element. The output should be a list of these resulting sublists.

Let's look at the provided assertions and the implementation:

### Program Logic
In the `func_1` function:
- The result is initialized as a list of `n` empty lists.
- The function then iterates over each element in the input list, using the index of each element to determine which of the `n` sublists it belongs to. This is done using `i % n`, which will give the correct index of the sublist for each element.

### Testing Against Examples
The examples given in the assertions check:
1. `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)` should return `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)` should return `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`.
3. `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)` should return `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`.

### Edge Cases
However, we should consider edge cases:
1. If the input list is empty `func_1([], 3)` should return `[[], [], []]` (three empty lists).
2. If `n` is 0, it likely should raise an error or handle that case appropriately since dividing by zero does not make sense in this context, but the implementation will break without any checks.
3. If `n` is greater than the length of the list, the output might not be as expected.

### Conclusion
Since there are edge cases (such as when `n` is 0 or greater than the list length) that the current implementation does not handle, we can conclude that the program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to account for scenarios where `n` is 0 or where the list is empty, and it does not validate the input adequately.
