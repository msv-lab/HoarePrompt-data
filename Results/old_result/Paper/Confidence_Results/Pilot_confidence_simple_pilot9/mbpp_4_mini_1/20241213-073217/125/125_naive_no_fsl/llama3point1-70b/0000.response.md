To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem description
The goal is to create a function that takes in a list and an integer `n` and splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Implementation
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the slicing**: The code uses a list comprehension that iterates `i` from `0` to `n-1` and constructs a sublist from `lst` starting at index `i`, taking every `n`th element thereafter.
   - `lst[i::n]` means start from index `i` and take every `n`th item until the end of the list.

2. **Potential edge cases**:
   - **Empty list**: The function should return an empty list if the input list is empty, which it correctly does.
     - `func_1([], 2)` would return `[]`, which is expected.
   - **n greater than list size**: If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, we should get one sublist starting from index `0`, which will contain only the first element if it exists.
     - Example: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` will return `[[1], [], [], []]`. This is correct according to the splitting logic, but it may not meet all interpretations of what it means to split.
   - **n = 0**: The implementation does not handle the case when `n` is `0`. This will throw an error since `range(0)` will lead to an empty loop, and attempting to slice `lst` with `::0` is not valid.
     - `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` would raise an error.

3. **What if n is negative?**: The function does not handle negative values for `n`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Conclusion
Given that the program does not correctly handle cases when `n` is `0` or negative, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**

Failure case: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` results in an error.
