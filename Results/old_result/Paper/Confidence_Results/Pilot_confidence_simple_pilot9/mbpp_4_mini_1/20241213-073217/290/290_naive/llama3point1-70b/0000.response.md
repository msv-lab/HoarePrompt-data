Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if any word in the input string contains the letter 'z' anywhere except at the start and the end of the word. It splits the input string into words, iterates through each word, and checks the substring from index 1 to the second last index (`word[1:-1]`). If the substring contains 'z', it returns `True`. If no such occurrence is found in any word, it returns `False`. 

- For example:
  - Input: "pizza" -> checks "pizza": contains 'z' in word[1:-1], returns True.
  - Input: "zebra" -> checks "zebra": does not consider 'z' at the start, returns False.
  - Input: "aze" -> checks "aze": does not consider 'z' at the end, returns False.
  - Input: "hello world" -> checks both words, returns False as neither contains 'z'.

Since all possible cases where 'z' might be present are handled correctly according to the description, the program is correct.
