Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters odd numbers from a list. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The function takes a list of integers as input.
2. It employs a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list.
3. It checks whether each number is odd (using `num % 2 != 0`).
4. If the condition is met, the number is included in the result list.

The provided assertions correctly validate the functionality of the function against various test cases, covering different scenarios with mixed even and odd numbers.

I cannot think of any potential cases in which this function would not perform correctly as per the problem description of filtering out odd numbers. Therefore, the function meets the requirements, and the code is correct for all typical inputs.
