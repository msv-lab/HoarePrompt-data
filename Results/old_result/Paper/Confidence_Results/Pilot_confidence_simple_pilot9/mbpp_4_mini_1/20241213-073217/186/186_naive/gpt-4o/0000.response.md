To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the function performs as expected.

### Problem description:
The function should extract elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. This implies that for each corresponding element from the two tuples, the program needs to perform an operation that enables extraction of elements.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

### Assertion Cases:
The assertions used test the following cases:
1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` should equal `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))` should equal `(1, 2, 3, 0)`.
3. `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))` should equal `(0, 9, 10, 0)`.

However, the function is using the bitwise AND operation (`&`) on the elements of the tuples, which does not align with the problem statement's vague description of "extracting" elements. The expected outcome, as derived from the assertions, suggests a different behavior than what a simple element-wise operation would offer. 

### Finding a potential case:
To assess the correctness, let's consider the input `(3, 2)` and `(1, 2)`:
- According to the expected logical extraction that is not clearly defined, one might expect extracting or associating values based on principle rather than a bitwise operation.
- The actual implementation with bitwise AND would yield `(3 & 1, 2 & 2)` which results in `(1, 2)` instead of an independent combined result of elements after “extraction” which does not make sense given the assertion examples related to outputs.

### Conclusion:
Since the implementation does not clarify its intended logic consistency with the description, and I can identify a case where it fails to operate as might be logically expected, we can assert that there is a discrepancy.

Correctness: **False**.
