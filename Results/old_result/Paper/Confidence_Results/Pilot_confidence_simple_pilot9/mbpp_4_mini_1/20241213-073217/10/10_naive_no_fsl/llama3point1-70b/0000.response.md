Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly. The volume formula for a triangular prism is given by the area of the triangular base multiplied by the length (height) of the prism. 

The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Here, the function correctly computes the triangular area as `b * h / 2` and then multiplies it by the length `l` of the prism (which is accurately represented as the third parameter).

Thus, the function correctly implements the volume calculation for any valid positive inputs for `b`, `h`, and `l`. 

Since I cannot think of any cases where the function would not work according to the problem description, I conclude that the function is correct.
