Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to find the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. It handles various test cases, including:

- `func_1(10, 20)`, which yields `200`
- `func_1(10, 5)`, which yields `50`
- `func_1(4, 2)`, which yields `8`

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the area for positive integer inputs. The behavior of the multiplication operation in Python ensures that it will return the correct area for the given lengths and widths. 

There are no apparent edge cases presented in the problem description that the code does not handle, such as negative dimensions or zero values. However, since it is implied that length and width should be positive for a physical rectangle, these edge cases can be considered out of scope of the problem as defined. 

Given that all tested scenarios work as expected and meet the problem's requirement, the program is correct.
