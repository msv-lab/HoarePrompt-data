Correctness: **False**.

The logic of the provided program is correct for calculating the area of a rectangle. However, the assertion statements are positioned above the function definition. If this code is executed in the current form, the assertions will fail because `func_1` is not defined when they are invoked. 

For example, if you try to run the assertions as they are positioned:

```python
assert func_1(10, 20) == 200  # This will raise an error since func_1 is not defined yet.
```

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description correctly because it will throw an error due to the order of execution. The function should be defined before any assertions are made. Even if the area calculation is correct, the placement of assertions makes the program incorrect.
