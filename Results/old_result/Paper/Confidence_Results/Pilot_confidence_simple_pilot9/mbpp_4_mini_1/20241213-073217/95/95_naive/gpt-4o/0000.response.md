Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The use of `s.count('std')` directly utilizes Python's string method to count non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring, which aligns with the problem description.

The provided assertions also cover a variety of scenarios:
- Strings where 'std' appears multiple times.
- A string where 'std' appears once.
- A string where 'std' does not appear at all.
- An empty string, which should return 0 occurrences.

There are no edge cases missed, and all test cases seem to reflect the requirements of the problem accurately. Thus, the implementation is correct.
