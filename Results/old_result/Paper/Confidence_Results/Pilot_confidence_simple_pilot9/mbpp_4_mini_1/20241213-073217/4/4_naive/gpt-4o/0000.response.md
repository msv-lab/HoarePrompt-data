To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in `func_1`.

The problem states that we need to check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only. The logic in the code uses the XOR operator, which will yield a number where bits are set to 1 for every position where the two inputs differ.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `xor_result = a ^ b`: This performs a bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b`. For example, if `a = 13` (binary `1101`) and `b = 9` (binary `1001`), `xor_result` would be `4` (binary `0100`). This indicates that there is one bit position where the two numbers differ.

2. `xor_result != 0`: This checks that `a` and `b` are not the same number. If they are equal, `xor_result` would be `0`, and the function should return `False`.

3. `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`: This checks if there is exactly one bit set in `xor_result`. The expression is true if the result of the XOR operation is a power of two (which means there's only one bit difference).

The problem description is clearly followed by this logic, but let's evaluate potential edge cases:

1. If `a` and `b` are both `0`, they are not differing at any bit position, so this should return `False`. The current implementation, however, would incorrectly return `False`, which is correct in this case, but we must ensure we consider inputs that are not specified in the assertions.

2. If the inputs are both negative numbers (using their two's complement representation), the program still needs to work under the same logic. For example, `-1` (binary representation would depend on system architecture) and `-2`. The two should return `False`, which they do since they differ at multiple positions.

3. It is important to consider large integers, both positive and negative, and whether they are differing at just one bit position as well.

Considering the assertions already present in the code, all supplied cases do confirm to show whether they differ at one position correctly.

Thus, after careful reasoning, it appears the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether two numbers differ by exactly one bit position under all tested scenarios and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code logic accurately reflects the requirements of the problem.
