Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether two given numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The XOR operator (`^`) compares the bits of `num1` and `num2`, and when two bits are different, it results in a `1`. The `bin()` function converts the result to a binary string, and `count('1')` counts how many bits are different. If the count is exactly `1`, it indicates that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. 

Considering various cases:
1. If `num1` and `num2` are the same (e.g., `5` and `5`), the result will be `0`, which is correctly identified by the program.
2. If they differ by one bit (e.g., `5` and `4`), the program correctly returns `True`.
3. If they differ by more than one bit (e.g., `5` and `2`), it returns `False`, which is also correct.

Since the function handles all potential input cases according to the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct in all scenarios.
