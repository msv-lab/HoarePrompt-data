Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the specified functionality from the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and generates a new tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements from the original tuple.

The following steps show how the code meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a tuple of numbers.
2. **Product Calculation**: It uses the `zip` function to pair each element `t_i` from the original tuple with its next element `t_{i+1}`.
3. **Tuple Creation**: It computes the product of each pair `(a, b)` and produces a new tuple using a generator expression.

The edge cases also yield expected results:
- For an input of a tuple with two numbers, `(2, 3)`, it returns `(6,)`, which is correct.
- For a tuple with one number, `(5,)`, it returns an empty tuple `()`, which meets the expected output since there's no pair of adjacent elements.
- For an empty tuple `()`, it also returns an empty tuple `()`, which is correct for the same reason.

Since I can't find any case where the code does not follow the problem description, I confidently conclude that the program is correct.
