Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` utilizes a set to determine if all characters in the string `s` are the same. A set consists of only unique elements, so if the length of the set derived from the string is 1, it indicates that all characters in the string are identical. 

Here's why the implementation works correctly for all potential cases:
- If the string is empty (`s = ""`), the set will also be empty, and the length will indeed be 0, which is not equal to 1. Thus it correctly identifies that not all characters are the same because there are no characters.
- If the string has one character (e.g., `s = "a"`), the resulting set will have a length of 1, confirming that all characters are the same.
- For strings with multiple characters, it checks if they are all identical effectively; for example, `s = "aaaa"` will result in a set of size 1, while `s = "aaab"` will result in a set of size 2. 

Consequently, there are no scenarios where the function fails to fulfill the problem description.
