Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the edge case where the input string is empty. According to the problem description, we should check whether all characters are the same. An empty string should logically be considered as having all the same characters (since there are no characters to compare), but the implementation returns `True` for an empty string. This contradicts the assertion provided in the program for `func_1('python')`, which means the program is incorrect for the expected behavior for an empty input case.

In summary, the program fails to address this edge case where an empty string is considered, leading to logical inconsistency.
