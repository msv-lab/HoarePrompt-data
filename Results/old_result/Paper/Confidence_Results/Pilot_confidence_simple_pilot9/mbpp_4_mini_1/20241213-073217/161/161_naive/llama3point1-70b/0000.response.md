Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to compute the n-th Lucas number. The base cases are handled properly with `n == 0` returning 2 and `n == 1` returning 1. For values of `n >= 2`, the program uses a loop to calculate the subsequent Lucas numbers by maintaining and updating two variables `a` and `b`, which represent the two most recent Lucas numbers. The formula used within the loop, `b = a + b`, correctly adheres to the definition of Lucas numbers, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. No edge cases seem to break the logic, thus making the implementation valid for all non-negative integer inputs.
