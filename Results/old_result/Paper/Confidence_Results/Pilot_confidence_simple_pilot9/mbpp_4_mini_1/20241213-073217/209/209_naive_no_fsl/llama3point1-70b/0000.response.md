To determine the correctness of the provided Python code, we must analyze the problem description and the program logic.

**Problem Description:** Write a Python function to get the first element of each sublist.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

**Test Cases to Consider:**
1. Normal case with multiple sublists.
   - Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`
   - Expected Output: `[1, 3, 5]`
   - Behavior: Correct result.
   
2. Case with empty sublists.
   - Input: `[[1, 2], [], [5, 6]]`
   - Expected Output: `[1, ?, 5]` (the `?` is undefined since there's no first element in the empty sublist)
   - Behavior: This will raise an `IndexError` since trying to access `sublist[0]` for an empty sublist will fail.

3. Case with all empty sublists.
   - Input: `[[], []]`
   - Expected Output: `[]`
   - Behavior: This will raise an `IndexError` because accessing the first element of any of the sublists would fail.

4. Case with no sublists.
   - Input: `[]`
   - Expected Output: `[]`
   - Behavior: This works and returns an empty list.

Given this analysis, the program fails to correctly handle cases where sublists are empty, as it will raise an error instead of returning an appropriate response.

Thus, the correct conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle empty sublists, leading to potential runtime errors.
