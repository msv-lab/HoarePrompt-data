To evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down both.

**Problem description:** Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.

**Program code:**
```python
def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]
```

The function `func_1` aims to extract the last character of each string in a tuple of strings. 

### Analyzing the code:

1. The function correctly iterates through each string `s` in the tuple `tup`.
2. For each string, it uses `s[-1]` to access the last character.
3. The function constructs a list of these last characters and returns it.

### Potential edge cases to consider:

- **Empty String:** What happens if one of the strings in the tuple is an empty string? For example:
  ```python
  assert func_1(('', 'test', 'example')) == ['', 't', 'e']
  ```
  In this case, when it tries to access `s[-1]` for the first string (`''`), it would raise an `IndexError` since there is no character to access.

- **Tuple of Empty Strings:** 
  ```python
  assert func_1(('', '', '')) == ['', '', '']
  ```
  Similar to the previous point, if all strings in the tuple are empty, this should also raise an error.

- **Non-string elements:** 
  If the tuple contains non-string elements such as integers or None, it would raise a `TypeError`:
  ```python
  assert func_1(('hello', 123, None))  # Raises TypeError
  ```

### Conclusion:
Since we found scenarios where the function will not handle empty strings or non-string elements correctly, thus producing errors, the function does not fulfill the problem description for all possible inputs. 

Correctness: **False**.
