Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly extracts the last character (rear index element) of each string in the given tuple. It utilizes a list comprehension, iterating through each string `s` in the input `strings` and indexing with `s[-1]` to retrieve the last character. 

The function would work correctly for various scenarios, such as:
1. A tuple of strings with varying lengths.
2. An empty string in the tuple would raise an `IndexError`, which is a potential edge case.
3. If the tuple is empty, it returns an empty list.

However, missing input validation for empty strings (which could raise an `IndexError`) indicates that while the main functionality is correct based on the expectation of the problem description, it notably does not handle all potential inputs as it should. 

Therefore, a scenario like this:
```python
func_1(("", "hello", "world"))
```
would break the function due to the attempt to access the last character of an empty string. 

Correctness: **False**.
