Correctness: **True**.

The program accurately counts the number of integer elements in the given list. It uses a generator expression to check if each element in the list is an instance of the `int` type, and then sums the results. The logic properly handles various cases, including:

1. An empty list, which will return `0`.
2. A list containing only integers, which will return the count of all elements.
3. A list containing a mix of data types (integers, floats, strings, etc.), which will correctly count only the integers.

Overall, the function adheres to the problem description for all potential cases, so it is correct.
