Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. It achieves this by finding the minimum and maximum values using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions, and then returning the difference between those two values. 

The provided tests confirm that the function works for the given examples:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

The function handles any valid input array correctly, so long as the array has at least two elements to compute a valid difference. There are no missing edge cases apparent in the current implementation, assuming that the input array is guaranteed to contain at least two elements. Thus, the program meets the problem description's requirements.
