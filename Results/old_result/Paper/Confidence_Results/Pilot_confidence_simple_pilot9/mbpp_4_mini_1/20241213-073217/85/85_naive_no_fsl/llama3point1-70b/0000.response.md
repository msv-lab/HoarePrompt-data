To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to consider various potential cases:

The problem states that we need to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided function `func_1` uses the formula `max(arr) - min(arr)` to calculate this difference.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The maximum difference between any two elements in an array can indeed be computed as the difference between the maximum and minimum values, since the largest possible difference will always be between the largest and smallest numbers.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Array**: If we provide an empty array (`arr = []`), the function will raise a `ValueError` because `max()` and `min()` cannot operate on an empty sequence.
   - **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element (`arr = [5]`), the maximum difference will be `0`, which is technically correct but could be considered a border case.

### Conclusion:
Since the function will raise an error for empty arrays, which is a valid input case that should be handled, it does not fulfill the requirement correctly for every potential case outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
The program does not handle the case of an empty array properly, resulting in an error.
