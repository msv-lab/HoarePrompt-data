To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to check if it correctly converts a snake case string (e.g., "example_string") into a camel case string (e.g., "ExampleString").

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str
```

1. The input string `snake_case_str` is split by underscores `_` using the `split('_')` method. This creates a list of words.
2. The list comprehension `(word.capitalize() for word in words)` capitalizes the first letter of each word in the list.
3. Finally, `''.join(...)` concatenates these capitalized words together.

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

- **Input with leading or trailing underscores**: If we input a snake case string with leading or trailing underscores, the current function will return incorrect results:
  - For example, `func_1("_example_string")` results in "ExampleString," which is incorrect because it discards the leading underscore.
  - Similarly, `func_1("example_string_")` results in "ExampleString," discarding the trailing underscore as well.

- **Multiple consecutive underscores**: If the string contains multiple underscores, the function will create empty strings in the `words` list, resulting in additional capitalized letters that may be incorrect.
  - For example, `func_1("example__string")` would produce "ExampleString" (without indicating the extra underscore), which does not represent camel case properly.

- **All lowercase characters without underscores**: For a perfect string, such as `func_1("example")`, it returns "Example," which is correct. But it's worth noting that the function expects at least one underscore.

- **Empty string**: If the input is an empty string `func_1("")`, it will return an empty string which is technically correct, but it might not meet user expectations.

Taking into consideration all the above potential cases and examples where the current implementation does not yield the expected output:

Correctness: **False**

The function fails to handle leading and trailing underscores as well as consecutive underscores, leading to incorrect camel case conversions in those cases.
