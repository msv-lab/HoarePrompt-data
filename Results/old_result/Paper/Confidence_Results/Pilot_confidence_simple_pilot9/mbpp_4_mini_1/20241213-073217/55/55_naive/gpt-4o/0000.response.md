Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not handle cases where the input snake_case string contains consecutive underscores or starts/ends with an underscore. For example:

1. Input: `'python__program'` should produce `'PythonProgram'`, but it will return `'PythonProgram'` as if the empty component between the underscores is ignored.
2. Input: `'_snake_case'` should produce `'SnakeCase'`, but it will return `'SnakeCase'` even with the leading underscore.
3. Input: `'snake_case_'` should produce `'SnakeCase'`, but it will return `'SnakeCase'` despite the trailing underscore.

In these cases, the function does not implement the correct logic as per the problem description, as it fails to manage underscores correctly.
