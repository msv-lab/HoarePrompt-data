Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle cases where the input string is empty or only contains underscores. Specifically:

1. If the input is an empty string (`''`), the function will return `''`, which is technically correct but doesn't conform to the usual expectations for converting to camel case, which might imply at least a single capital letter indicating a word.
  
2. If the input consists solely of underscores (e.g., `'____'`), the function will generate a list containing empty strings (`['', '', '', '']`) and capitalize these empty strings to return `''`.

These scenarios indicate that the function doesn't handle edge cases adequately, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, it does not fully meet the problem description.
