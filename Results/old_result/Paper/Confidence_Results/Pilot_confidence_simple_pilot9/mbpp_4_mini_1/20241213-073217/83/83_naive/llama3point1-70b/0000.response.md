To determine the correctness of the provided Python program for sorting a list of elements, let's analyze the code in detail.

The function `func_1(arr)` attempts to sort the list `arr` using a selection-type approach, where it finds the maximum element and tries to position it at the end of the unsorted section of the list by performing reversals.

Here's a brief overview of how the function operates:
1. It iterates from the full range of the list down to just a single element.
2. For each iteration, it identifies the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list.
3. It then reverses the subarray leading up to and including the maximum element and subsequently reverses the entire unsorted portion to place the maximum at its correct end position.

However, there is a flaw in the program logic. Specifically, consider the case where the input list is partially sorted or has duplicate elements. For example:

Input: 
```python
func_1([3, 1, 2, 3])
```
The program would behave incorrectly in this instance:
- It will find the maximum which is `3` at index `0` and reverse the first section.
- As it continues, the handling of the second `3` will be flawed, potentially leading to an incorrectly sorted list.

Another common case is when the list is already sorted:
Input:
```python
func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```
The reversing logic applied repetitively could disrupt the order of already sorted elements.

Additionally, if the input list has length less than 2 or all identical elements, the behavior will not properly verify against the given problem description of sorting, as the data structure remains unchanged or mismanaged.

Thus, given these examples:

Correctness: **False**.
