To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will review the logic of the `func_1` function. The problem description is to sort a list of elements.

### Analysis of `func_1` Function
The function attempts to sort the input list `arr` using a method that repeatedly finds the maximum element in the sub-list defined by the current size and reverses parts of the list in order to position that maximum correctly. 

### Potential Cases to Consider
1. **Empty List**: If the input is an empty list `[]`, the sorted output should also be `[]`. This case is correctly handled by the function as it does nothing and simply returns the input.
   
2. **Single Element List**: For a list with a single element, e.g., `[5]`, it should return `[5]`. The function correctly handles this by not making any operations.

3. **Already Sorted List**: For an already sorted list, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, the function should return `[1, 2, 3]`. The maximum is at the end, and the logic would still correctly manage this.

4. **Reversed List**: For a list that is in reverse order, e.g., `[3, 2, 1]`, the function may correctly sort it to `[1, 2, 3]` because it will continually reverse sections to move maximum values to the end.

5. **All Equal Elements**: For a list with all the same elements, e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`, the function should still return `[2, 2, 2]`. The function would handle this without issues since all comparisons would be equal.

6. **General Lists**: For a general unsorted list, e.g., `[3, 1, 2]`, I expect it to return `[1, 2, 3]`. The function logic by extracting maxima and reversing should handle this.

### Test Cases Failing
After conducting these tests, I've realized the function does not account for when the maximum value appears multiple times.

For example:
- **Input**: `[2, 1, 2]`
- **Expected Output**: `[1, 2, 2]`
- **Output from Function**: The function would get confused with the `max_index` repeatedly pointing to the first occurrence and reversing portions incorrectly, and this could disrupt the order.

### Conclusion
The function does not correctly handle certain cases, specifically when there are multiple instances of the maximum element. This shows that there exists at least one case where it fails to meet the requirement of sorting the list correctly.

Correctness: **False**
