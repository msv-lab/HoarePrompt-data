Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number (target) in a sorted array (arr). The implementation employs a binary search algorithm, which efficiently narrows down the potential indices where the target could be found.

Hereâ€™s why the code is correct:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The code maintains two pointers (`low` and `high`) that define the search interval. It calculates the middle index and compares the middle element with the target.

2. **Finding First Occurrence**: When the target is found at `arr[mid]`, instead of returning immediately, the code updates the `result` and continues searching in the left half of the array by setting `high = mid - 1`. This ensures that the first occurrence is captured.

3. **Handles Edge Cases**: The function will correctly return -1 if the target is not present in the array, as the loop will exit without finding a valid index. 

The provided assertions confirm expected indices for specific cases, and the function behaves as desired across the various examples considered. Since no edge cases or flaws have been identified that would break the implementation, the program can be deemed correct.
