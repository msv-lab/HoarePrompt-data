Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers and uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers by checking if each number is divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). This correctly implements the requirement of finding even numbers from a list of numbers.

I could not identify any potential edge cases or scenarios where the function would not work as intended. For example:
- If the input list is empty (`[]`), the output would also be an empty list (`[]`), which is correct.
- If the input list contains only odd numbers (`[1, 3, 5]`), the output would be an empty list (`[]`), which is also correct.
- If the input list contains negative even numbers (`[-2, -4, -3]`), they would be correctly returned in the output as `[-2, -4`.

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description, I deem the function to be correct.
