Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the task of finding even numbers from a list of numbers. The function `func_1` utilizes a list comprehension to return all numbers that satisfy the condition of being even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). 

I have reviewed the assertions provided in the program, which test the function with various inputs:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`, which is correct since 2 and 4 are the even numbers in the list.
2. `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])` returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, correctly identifying all the even numbers in that list.
3. `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19])` returns `[8, 12]`, which accurately includes only the even numbers from the input.

The list comprehension in the function works correctly for any list of integers. There are no edge cases or missing logic that would prevent this function from accurately finding even numbers. It handles positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero correctly.

Since I cannot find any inputs or scenarios in which the function would fail to adhere to the problem description, I affirm the correctness of the implementation.
