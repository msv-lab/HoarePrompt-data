Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function `func_1` that returns the ASCII value of a character using the `ord()` function. The assertions provided check the function for specific characters ('A', 'R', 'S'), and it can be observed that the code will work for any valid single character input.

The `ord()` function correctly converts a character to its corresponding ASCII value for any character that is passed to it. There are no missing logic parts or edge cases that would lead to incorrect behavior, as `ord()` handles all valid characters as expected.

Thus, I cannot think of any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
