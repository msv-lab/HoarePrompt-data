Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the integer `L` is greater than the length of the input list. For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, we would expect it to return `([1, 2, 3], [])` as a valid split, but since the index slice `lst[:L]` would return the entire list and the slicing `lst[L:]` would return an empty list, it would cause unintended behavior in a logic that assumes `L` is always valid (i.e., within the bounds of the list length). Thus, the implementation does not satisfy the problem description in all cases.
