Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement described. The problem states that the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. However, the implementation `return list1[:-1] + list2` simply returns all elements of `list1` except the last one (thus effectively discarding it), and appends all elements of `list2` to that.

For example:

1. If we take `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])`, instead of replacing `10` with `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, the code will return `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which is not the desired output.

2. For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8])`, it will output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]`, which again does not replace the last element `5` with the list `[5, 6, 7, 8]`.

Thus, the implementation fails to meet the requirement of the problem description.
