To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the program against the problem description. 

**Problem description**: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

**Program Code**:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

**Analysis**:
1. The function takes two sorted lists and their size as arguments.
2. It merges the two lists and sorts them, which is unnecessary since they are already sorted. However, for this guide, we'll set that aside.
3. The logic to find the median is based on checking if the size is even or odd.
4. In the case of even sizes, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements. In the case of odd sizes, the median is simply the middle element.

Now, let's consider potential issues:
- The `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which assumes that the median index for an even-sized array will be accurate. However, for even-sized arrays, the middle elements should be at indexes `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`, not `size - 1` and `size`.
- If `size` is supposed to represent the size of each of the two given lists, the median calculation does not account for the fact that two sorted lists of size `n` will result in a merged list of size `2n`, which alters how we need to calculate the indices for determining the median.

### Edge Case:
For example, consider:
- `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, with `size = 2`.
- The merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

The code incorrectly calculates the middle index as `1`:
- `middle_index = size - 1 = 1`
- The program will then retrieve `merged_list[1]` and `merged_list[2]` to calculate the median, which is incorrect.

Since the function provides an incorrect median for cases where size is meant to represent each individual list rather than the merged total, the function is incorrect.

**Conclusion**:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly find the median for both even-sized merged lists due to an inaccurate calculation of indices based on how size is defined.
