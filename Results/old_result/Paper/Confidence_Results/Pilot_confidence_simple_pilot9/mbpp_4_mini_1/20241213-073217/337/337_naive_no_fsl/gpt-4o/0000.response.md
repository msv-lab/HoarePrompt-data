To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the implementation against the problem description, which requires finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

### Given Implementation:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

### Case Analysis:
1. The function uses `set(lst)`, which converts the list to a set, effectively removing any duplicate elements. 
2. Then, it calculates the sum of the unique elements using `sum(...)`.

### Examples Provided in Assertions:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` returns `21` (which is the sum of `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6` since `1` is counted only once).
- `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` returns `71` (which is the sum of `1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 45` counting `10` and `4` only once).
- `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` returns `78` (which is the sum of `2, 9, 10, 12, 45` counting `10` and `45` only once).

### Issue with Implementation:
The problem specifically states to find the sum of **non-repeated** elements. In the implementation, however, repeated elements are not accounted for. Instead, it sums all unique elements, including those that may have had repetitions.

For example:
- For the input `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, the function returns `10` (`1` is included only once), but the expected output for non-repeated values (only counting values that appear exactly once) would be `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`.

### Conclusion:
Since the implementation does not correctly sum only the non-repeated elements (it sums all unique elements instead), it does not adhere to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False** 

The implementation fails for input lists where values appear more than once but less than the count required to classify them as repeated based on unique counts. This leads to incorrect summation.
