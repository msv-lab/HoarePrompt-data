To assess the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze it based on the problem description and examine if it correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from a list in a tuple.

### Program Analysis
The function `func_1` is designed to:
1. Take a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`.
2. Count how many times each element in `elements` appears in `tup`.
3. Return the total count of occurrences.

**Code Logic:**
```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

### Functionality Verification
- It utilizes a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list `elements`.
- For each element, it uses the `count` method of the tuple to find the number of occurrences in `tup`.
- The results of the `count` calls are summed up to get the final count.

#### Provided Test Cases:
1. `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3`
   - 'a' appears 2 times and 'b' appears 1 time. Total = 3.
   
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6`
   - '1' appears 3 times, '4' appears 2 times, and '7' appears 1 time. Total = 6.
   
3. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2`
   - '1' appears 1 time and '2' appears 1 time. Total = 2.

### Check for Edge Cases
Now, we will consider cases that could potentially cause the program to fail or not meet the requirements.

1. **Empty Tuple and Elements:** 
   - `func_1((), [])` → This should return `0` since there are no elements in the tuple and list.

2. **Elements Not in Tuple:**
   - `func_1((1, 2, 3), [4, 5])` → This should return `0` as there are no occurrences of `4` or `5`.

3. **Duplicate Elements in the List:**
   - `func_1((1, 2, 1, 2), [1, 2])` → The return should be `4` since both `1` and `2` occur twice each.

4. **Non-existent elements where tuple contains none of the listed elements:**
   - If the tuple has unique elements that are not in the list, the function should still return `0`.

#### Conclusion
The function behaves as expected for the described test cases and handles the edge cases correctly.

Based on the reasoning above, I find no contradiction between the program's behavior and the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
