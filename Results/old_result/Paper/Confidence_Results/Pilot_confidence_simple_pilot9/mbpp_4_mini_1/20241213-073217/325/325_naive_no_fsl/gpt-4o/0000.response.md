Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential inputs as specified in the problem description. According to the problem, we need to check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) has 30 days. The months that contain 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

However, the test cases in the program are incorrect because:
1. The assertion `assert func_1(2) == False` is not valid because February (month 2) is defined to have 28 or 29 days depending on the year (non-leap year or leap year). But for the purposes of this problem, it should return False since February does not have 30 days.
2. The assertion `assert func_1(12) == False` is also correct since December has 31 days. However, this assertion does not cover any of the actual logic of the function, which fails to check any months outside of the defined set.

Additionally, the program does not handle inputs outside of the range 1 to 12, nor does it address edge cases such as invalid month numbers (like 0 or 13). Thus, there are potential cases where the function does not behave as expected, leading to the overall conclusion that the correctness is False.
