To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic step by step based on the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to transform a zero matrix \( B \) into a matrix \( A \) using operations that set a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix of \( B \) to ones.
   - The operation can only be performed if the corresponding \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix in \( A \) is filled with ones.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program initializes an empty matrix \( B \) filled with zeros.
   - It iterates through each possible \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix in \( A \).
   - If a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix of \( A \) is entirely ones, it performs the operation on \( B \) and records the operation.
   - Finally, it checks if \( B \) matches \( A \). If they do not match, it returns -1.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - The program only checks for \( 2 \times 2 \) blocks of ones in \( A \) to perform the operation. However, it does not account for cases where there are isolated ones in \( A \) that cannot be covered by any \( 2 \times 2 \) block. For instance:
     - If \( A \) is:
       ```
       1 0
       0 0
       ```
       The program would not be able to cover the single `1` at position (0,0) since it requires a \( 2 \times 2 \) block to operate.
     - The program would incorrectly return `0` operations, but it is impossible to create \( A \) from \( B \) in this case.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since there exists at least one case where the program does not work as expected (i.e., it fails to identify isolated ones that cannot be covered by a \( 2 \times 2 \) block), the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
