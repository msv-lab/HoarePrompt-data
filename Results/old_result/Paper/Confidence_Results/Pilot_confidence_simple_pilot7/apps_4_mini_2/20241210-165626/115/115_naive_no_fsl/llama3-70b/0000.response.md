To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to transform matrix B (initially all zeros) into matrix A using operations that set a 2x2 submatrix in B to 1. The conditions for performing these operations are that all four positions of the selected 2x2 submatrix in A must be 1.

### Code Analysis
The program iterates through each possible top-left corner of a 2x2 submatrix in A (from `(0,0)` to `(n-2,m-2)`). It checks if it can perform an operation to set a 2x2 block in B to 1 based on the conditions described. If any of the four corners of the 2x2 submatrix in A is 1, it adds the operation to the list.

### Potential Issues
1. **Incorrect Logic for Operations**: The program checks for the presence of 1s in the 2x2 block only if all four positions are 1. However, it does not account for cases where it's possible to perform operations that could lead to achieving the desired matrix A through a series of valid operations. The logic only adds operations when all four positions are 1, which might lead to missing valid operations.
  
2. **Final Check**: After attempting to set the operations, the program does not verify if the resulting B matrix matches A. It simply prints the operations based on the initial checks without confirming the final state.

### Example of Failure Case
Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```
In this case, the program would not add any operations because it does not find any 2x2 block where all four corners are 1. However, it is possible to achieve matrix A by performing operations on overlapping submatrices. Therefore, the output should not be `-1`, but rather it should find a sequence of operations that can lead to the desired result.

### Conclusion
The program fails to correctly identify valid operations and does not verify the final state of matrix B against matrix A. Therefore, it does not meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
