To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and check if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Matrices A and B**: We have two matrices, A (input) and B (initially all zeros).
2. **Operations**: We can perform operations on B by selecting a 2x2 submatrix and setting its values to 1.
3. **Goal**: The goal is to transform B into A using these operations, and we need to check if it's possible.

### Program Logic
- The program reads the dimensions of the matrix and the matrix A.
- It initializes matrix B with zeros.
- It then iterates through A, looking for 2x2 blocks of 1s. If such a block is found, it marks the corresponding 2x2 block in B with 1s and records the operation.
- After processing, it checks if B matches A. If not, it returns -1.

### Potential Issues in the Program
1. **Partial Coverage**: The program only sets B to 1 when it finds a complete 2x2 block of 1s in A. However, if A has isolated 1s or 1s that cannot form a complete 2x2 block, the program will not account for those cases correctly.
2. **Example Case**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   3 3
   1 0 1
   1 0 1
   0 0 0
   ```
   In this case, the program will not be able to form the required matrix B because the 1s in A cannot be covered by any 2x2 operations. The program will return -1, which is correct. However, if we have a case like:
   ```
   3 3
   1 1 1
   1 0 1
   0 0 0
   ```
   The program will not be able to reach the target matrix A since there is a 1 at (1, 2) in A that cannot be covered by any 2x2 operation from B.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle cases where there are isolated 1s or configurations of 1s that cannot form a complete 2x2 block. Therefore, it may return -1 incorrectly or fail to produce the required output in certain cases.

Correctness: **False**
