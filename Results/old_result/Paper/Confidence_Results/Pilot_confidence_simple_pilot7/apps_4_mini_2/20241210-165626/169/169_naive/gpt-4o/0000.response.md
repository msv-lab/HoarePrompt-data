Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not account for the requirement that the pile must be non-empty before each operation of taking a stone. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
---
```
In this case, the program would start with `stones = 0`. When it processes the first `-`, it would attempt to decrease `stones`, but since `stones` is already `0`, it remains `0`. However, according to the problem description, Vasya must have at least `3` stones initially to perform the three `-` operations. Therefore, the output should be `0`, which is correct, but the logic does not enforce the initial condition properly.

Another problematic case is:
```
5
++-++
```
The program would start with `stones = 0`, and after processing the first two `+` operations, it would have `stones = 2`. The `-` operation would reduce it to `1`, and the final `+` would increase it to `2`. However, the problem states that if Vasya started with `0` stones, he would end up with `3` stones after performing the operations. The program would incorrectly output `2` instead of `3`.

Thus, the program does not properly handle the requirement that the pile must not be empty before taking a stone, leading to incorrect outputs for certain cases.
