To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and identify if it handles all potential edge cases correctly.

The problem requires finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. If there are multiple \( k \) values that yield the same minimum LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be returned.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1(x, y)`: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - `func_2(x, y)`: Computes the LCM of \( x \) and \( y \) using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
   - `func_3(a, b)`: This is the main function that calculates the desired \( k \).

2. **Logic in `func_3`**:
   - If \( a \) is equal to \( b \), it immediately returns \( k = 0 \) since \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = a \).
   - It calculates the absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \).
   - It iterates through possible divisors of \( \text{diff} \) up to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \) to find potential candidates for \( k \).
   - For each candidate \( k \), it calculates the new values \( new_a \) and \( new_b \) by rounding up \( a \) and \( b \) to the nearest multiple of \( k \).
   - It computes the LCM of these new values and checks if it is the smallest found so far.

### Potential Issue

The program seems to focus on divisors of the difference \( |a - b| \) and calculates \( k \) based on those. However, it does not consider the case where \( k = 0 \) explicitly in the loop. For some values of \( a \) and \( b \), \( k = 0 \) could yield a better LCM, but this is only checked explicitly at the beginning when \( a = b \).

#### Test Case to Consider

Let's consider the case where \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 10 \):
- The program should return \( k = 0 \) since \( \text{LCM}(5+0, 10+0) = \text{LCM}(5, 10) = 10 \).
  
Now, let's try \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \):
- The program returns \( k = 2 \), which is correct as \( \text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 \) is the minimum possible.

However, let's consider \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \):
- The program will check \( k \) values derived from the divisors of \( 1 \) (which are \( 1 \)), leading to \( k = 1 \) yielding \( \text{LCM}(2, 3) = 6 \). 
- If we check \( k = 0 \), we find \( \text{LCM}(1, 2) = 2 \), which is indeed smaller than what the program would return.

### Conclusion

The program does not account for \( k = 0 \) in all situations, which can lead to incorrect results when \( a \) and \( b \) are not equal. Since there exists a case where the program fails to return the correct minimal \( k \):

Correctness: **False**
