To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in `func_3` and see if it correctly finds the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a + k` and `b + k` is minimized.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Identical Inputs**: If `a` and `b` are equal, the program correctly returns `0`, since `LCM(a, a) = a`, which is the smallest possible LCM.

2. **Finding Divisors**: The program calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, and then iterates through all divisors of this difference. For each divisor `k`, it computes potential new values for `a` and `b` adjusted by `k`.

3. **Calculating New Values**: The program computes `new_a` and `new_b` as the next multiples of `k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively.

4. **LCM Calculation**: It uses `func_2` to calculate the LCM of the adjusted values and keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding `k`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program only considers `k` values derived from the divisors of the difference `diff = |a - b|`. However, there might be cases where a `k` value that is not a divisor of `diff` could yield a smaller LCM. 

### Example Case to Test:
Consider the case where `a = 5` and `b = 6`.
- The absolute difference `diff` is `1`, and its only divisor is `1`.
- If we calculate with `k = 0`, `LCM(5 + 0, 6 + 0) = LCM(5, 6) = 30`.
- If we calculate with `k = 1`, `LCM(5 + 1, 6 + 1) = LCM(6, 7) = 42`.

In this case, the program would return `1`, but it should return `0` since `k = 0` gives a smaller LCM.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the possibility of `k` values that are not divisors of the difference `diff`, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Correctness: **False**.
