To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to find a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \( k \) that achieve the same minimum LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be chosen.

### Provided Program:
```python
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
2. **LCM Calculation**: It defines two functions:
   - `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2` computes the LCM using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. **Finding Minimum LCM**: The program initializes \( k \) to 0 and calculates the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \). It enters a loop that continues to increment \( k \) until it finds an LCM that is not less than the previously found minimum LCM.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Output of \( k \)**: The program prints \( k - 1 \) after the loop. This could lead to incorrect results because if the loop breaks on the first iteration (when \( k = 0 \)), it would print \(-1\), which is invalid since \( k \) must be non-negative.
2. **Infinite Loop**: If the LCM continues to decrease indefinitely (which is unlikely but theoretically possible), the program could enter an infinite loop.
3. **Not Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, or when \( a \) or \( b \) is at the upper limit of the constraints.

### Test Case to Illustrate Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
1 1
```
- Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 1 \).
- The expected output is \( k = 0 \) because \( \text{LCM}(1 + 0, 1 + 0) = \text{LCM}(1, 1) = 1 \) is the smallest possible.
- However, the program will evaluate \( k = 0 \), find the LCM as 1, and then it will try \( k = 1 \) where \( \text{LCM}(2, 2) = 2 \), and then it will break. It will print \( k - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1 \), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not consistently adhere to the requirements of the problem description due to the incorrect handling of \( k \) and potential infinite loops. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
