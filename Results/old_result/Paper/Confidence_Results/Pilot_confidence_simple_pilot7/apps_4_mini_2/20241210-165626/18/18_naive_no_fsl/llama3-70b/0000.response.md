To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Three integers `n`, `k`, and `t`.
   - `n`: Total number of spectators.
   - `k`: Maximum number of spectators that can stand at the same time.
   - `t`: The time at which we want to know how many spectators are standing.
  
2. **Output**: The number of spectators standing at time `t`.

### Logic of the Program:
1. The program reads the input values for `n`, `k`, and `t`.
2. It checks if `t` is less than or equal to `n`:
   - If `t <= n`, it prints `min(t, k)`, which means:
     - If the time `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it returns the number of spectators standing (which is `t`).
     - If `t` is greater than `k`, it returns `k` (maximum spectators standing).
3. If `t > n`, it calculates the number of spectators standing using `k - (t - n) % k`.

### Edge Cases:
- For `t` values from `1` to `k`: The output should be `t`.
- For `t` values from `k + 1` to `n`: The output should be `k`.
- For `t` values from `n + 1` to `n + k`: The output should decrease from `k` down to `0`.

### Testing the Logic:
1. **Case when `t` is less than `k`**:
   - Input: `10 5 3`
     - Expected Output: `3`
     - Program Output: `3` (Correct)

2. **Case when `t` is exactly `k`**:
   - Input: `10 5 5`
     - Expected Output: `5`
     - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

3. **Case when `t` is greater than `k` and less than or equal to `n`**:
   - Input: `10 5 7`
     - Expected Output: `5`
     - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

4. **Case when `t` is greater than `n`**:
   - Input: `10 5 12`
     - Expected Output: `3`
     - Program Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Additional Edge Case**:
   - Input: `10 5 11`
     - Expected Output: `4`
     - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description. It uses conditional logic to determine the number of spectators standing at any given time `t` based on the rules provided.

Correctness: **True**
