To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
Sofia wants to draw `n` squares, and the task is to minimize the number of segments that she has to draw with a ruler (without a guide). The segments are of length 1 and can be horizontal or vertical. The output should be the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn without a guide.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2)
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: It reads an integer `n` which represents the number of squares.
2. **Bit Length Calculation**: The expression `n.bit_length()` returns the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary. This is equivalent to finding the position of the highest set bit in `n`.
3. **Calculation**: The formula used is `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.

### Understanding the Formula:
- The formula seems to be trying to calculate the number of segments based on the number of squares `n`.
- The `bit_length()` approach is not intuitive in relation to drawing squares and how segments can be reused. 

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **For n = 1**:
   - Expected output: 2 (two segments for one square).
   - Actual output: `2 * (1.bit_length() - 1) + 2` = `2 * (1 - 1) + 2` = `2`. (Correct)

2. **For n = 2**:
   - Expected output: 3 (three segments).
   - Actual output: `2 * (2.bit_length() - 1) + 2` = `2 * (2 - 1) + 2` = `2 * 1 + 2` = `4`. (Incorrect)

3. **For n = 4**:
   - Expected output: 4 (four segments).
   - Actual output: `2 * (4.bit_length() - 1) + 2` = `2 * (3 - 1) + 2` = `2 * 2 + 2` = `6`. (Incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn without a guide for cases where `n` is greater than 1. 

Thus, we find that the program fails for multiple test cases, specifically for `n = 2` and `n = 4`.

Correctness: **False**.
