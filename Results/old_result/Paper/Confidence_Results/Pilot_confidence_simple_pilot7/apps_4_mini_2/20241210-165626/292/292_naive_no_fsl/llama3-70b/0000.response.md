To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and consider the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- Limak's weight (`a`) is tripled every year.
- Bob's weight (`b`) is doubled every year.
- We need to find out after how many full years Limak's weight will be strictly greater than Bob's weight.

### Program Logic:
The function reads two integers `a` and `b`, initializes a counter `years` to 0, and then enters a loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Inside the loop:
1. It triples Limak's weight (`a`).
2. It doubles Bob's weight (`b`).
3. It increments the `years` counter.

Finally, it prints the number of years.

### Test Cases:
1. **Input: 4 7**
   - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 14 (still not larger)
   - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 28 (now Limak is larger)
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

2. **Input: 4 9**
   - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 18 (still not larger)
   - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 36 (still not larger)
   - Year 3: Limak = 108, Bob = 72 (now Limak is larger)
   - Output: 3 (Correct)

3. **Input: 1 1**
   - Year 1: Limak = 3, Bob = 2 (now Limak is larger)
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

### Edge Case:
Now, let's consider the edge case where `a` and `b` are at their maximum values according to the constraints:
- **Input: 10 10**
  - Year 1: Limak = 30, Bob = 20 (now Limak is larger)
  - Output: 1 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program handles all provided examples correctly and also handles the edge case of both weights being equal. It correctly calculates the number of years required for Limak to exceed Bob's weight in all scenarios.

Thus, we find no potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
