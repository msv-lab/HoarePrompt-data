Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly simulates the weight changes of Limak and Bob over the years. It checks the condition where Limak's weight (which is tripled each year) must become strictly greater than Bob's weight (which is doubled each year). The loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, and it counts the number of years taken for this to happen. 

All the provided examples in the problem description are handled correctly:
- For input (4, 7), it outputs 2, which is correct.
- For input (4, 9), it outputs 3, which is also correct.
- For input (1, 1), it outputs 1, which is correct as Limak's weight will become 3 after one year.

Since the program correctly handles the cases specified in the description and adheres to the constraints, it is deemed correct.
