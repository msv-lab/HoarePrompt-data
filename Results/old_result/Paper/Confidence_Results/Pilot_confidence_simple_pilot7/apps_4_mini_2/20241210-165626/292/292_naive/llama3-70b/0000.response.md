Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes two integers as input representing the weights of Limak and Bob. The while loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight, tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight each year. 

The program accurately counts the number of years it takes for Limak to exceed Bob's weight, and it correctly handles all specified input cases within the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10). 

For example:
- For input `4 7`, Limak's weight becomes `12` and Bob's `14` after the first year, and then `36` and `28` after the second year, resulting in `2` years, which is correct.
- For input `4 9`, Limak's weights over the years are `12` and `18`, then `36` and `36`, and finally `108` and `72`, leading to `3` years, which is also correct.
- For input `1 1`, Limak's weight becomes `3` and Bob's `2` after the first year, thus correctly returning `1`.

Since I cannot find any potential case where the program does not meet the requirements, it is correct.
