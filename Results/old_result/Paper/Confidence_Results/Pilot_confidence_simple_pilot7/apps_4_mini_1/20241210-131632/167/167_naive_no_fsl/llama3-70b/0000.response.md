Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to verify the path in the matrix as described in the problem statement. Specifically, there are issues with how the function `func_1` calculates the matrix indices and checks the adjacency condition.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Matrix Index Calculation**: The calculation of `(nx, ny)` using `((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)` assumes a zero-based index, while the problem description implies a one-based index. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the indices for the elements of the matrix.

2. **Bounds Check**: The outer loop iterates `x` and `y` from 1 to 1,000,000 without ensuring that `x * y` is larger than the maximum value in `a`. However, the inner logic does not correctly handle cases where `a` contains values that cannot exist in any valid matrix configuration, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Path Validation Logic**: The function `func_1` checks if the visited cells are adjacent but does not consider cases where the path may revisit cells or where the path may not be valid due to the matrix dimensions. 

### Example of Failure Case:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case, the program should return "YES" with a suitable `x` and `y`. However, if the path is modified to:
```
5
1 2 3 5 4
```
The program may incorrectly validate the adjacency due to the issues mentioned above, leading to an incorrect output.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem's requirements in all cases, resulting in the conclusion that it is incorrect.
