Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios as described in the problem statement. 

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. The condition `if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:` checks if the number of friends (`M`) is greater than or equal to the number of new coins needed (`L`) and also checks if they can gift enough different coins given Ivan's current collection. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that all friends can gift a unique coin and that at least `L` of those coins are new.

2. Consider the case where:
   - `N = 10`
   - `M = 11`
   - `K = 5`
   - `L = 6`

   In this case, Ivan has 5 coins, and there are 10 different coins in total. There are 11 friends who want to gift coins. The program will output `-1`, which is correct because there aren't enough unique coins for each friend to gift. However, the program does not account for scenarios where `M` is less than `L` but still allows for unique gifting.

3. Another problematic case is when `M` is equal to `N - K` but `L` is greater than that value. For example:
   - `N = 10`
   - `M = 5`
   - `K = 5`
   - `L = 6`

   Here, Ivan has 5 friends, 5 coins in his collection, and needs 6 new coins. The program would output `-1`, but the friends can gift 1 coin each, resulting in 5 new coins. The program fails to account for the possibility of gifting more than 1 coin per friend to satisfy `L`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that all conditions are satisfied for every potential case. Therefore, it is deemed incorrect.
