To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
Vasya wants to buy non-negative integers of two items (Ber-Cola and Bars) such that he spends exactly `n` burles. The costs of these items are given as `a` and `b`. The task is to find integers `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) and `y` (number of Bars) such that:

\[ x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \]

If such integers exist, the program should print "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`. If they do not exist, it should print "NO".

### Code Analysis:
The program uses a loop to iterate through possible values of `x` (from `0` to `n // a`) and checks if the remaining money after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola can be exactly spent on Bars. It checks this condition using:

```python
if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
```

If the condition is met, it calculates `y` and prints the result.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**: 
   - If `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`, the output should be "YES" and "1 0" (1 Ber-Cola, 0 Bars).
   - If `n = 1`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`, the output should be "NO" (not enough money to buy either item).

2. **Exact Matches**:
   - If `n` is exactly divisible by `a` or `b`, the program should correctly identify that it can buy only one type of item.

3. **Large Inputs**:
   - The program should handle large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` efficiently without running into performance issues.

### Potential Issues:
1. The loop iterates `n // a + 1` times. If `a` is greater than `n`, the loop will not run at all, which is fine because it will correctly print "NO" if neither item can be bought.
2. The program does not check for cases where `a` or `b` might be larger than `n` or situations where both `a` and `b` are greater than `n` simultaneously.

### Example Cases:
- **Case**: 
  - Input: `n = 10`, `a = 3`, `b = 4`
  - Possible combinations: 
    - `x = 0`, `y = 2` (0 Ber-Cola, 2 Bars) => `0*3 + 2*4 = 8` (not valid)
    - `x = 1`, `y = 1` (1 Ber-Cola, 1 Bar) => `1*3 + 1*4 = 7` (not valid)
    - `x = 2`, `y = 1` (2 Ber-Cola, 1 Bar) => `2*3 + 1*4 = 10` (valid)
  - Output: "YES" and "2 1"

- **Counterexample**:
  - Input: `n = 15`, `a = 10`, `b = 6`
  - The program will iterate for `x = 0` (0 Ber-Cola, 15 left) => `15 % 6 != 0`, then for `x = 1` (1 Ber-Cola, 5 left) => `5 % 6 != 0`, and it will print "NO", which is correct.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya can purchase the items within the given constraints. 

Correctness: **True**.
