Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles on bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. It checks all possible non-negative integer values of `x` (the number of Ber-Cola bottles) from `0` to `n // a`, and for each `x`, it computes the remaining money after buying `x` bottles. It then checks if this remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a Bars bar `b` to find the corresponding value of `y`.

The program handles all edge cases as follows:
1. It considers the case when `n` is less than both `a` and `b`, which would correctly output "NO" since Vasya cannot buy anything.
2. It correctly handles cases where `a` or `b` is greater than `n`, ensuring that it doesn't attempt to buy more than what can be afforded.
3. The program will also return "YES" with valid values for `x` and `y` if a valid combination exists.

Since I cannot find any input case where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.
