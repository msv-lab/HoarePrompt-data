Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple cycles in the graph. The logic to remove an edge and check for cycles is flawed, as it only checks one edge at a time without considering that there may be multiple edges contributing to the same cycle.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 5
1 2
2 3
3 1
3 4
4 2
```

In this graph, there is a cycle formed by the edges (1 → 2 → 3 → 1) and another cycle that involves (2 → 3 → 4 → 2). If we remove the edge (3 → 1), we still have a cycle (2 → 3 → 4 → 2), and the graph remains cyclic. The program would incorrectly return 'YES' since it only checks for cycles after removing one edge, without considering that multiple edges may need to be removed to break all cycles.

Thus, the program fails to account for all possible cycles and edge cases, leading to incorrect outputs.
