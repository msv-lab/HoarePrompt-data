To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic and see if it adheres to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have `n` plates, `a` pieces of the first cake, and `b` pieces of the second cake.
2. Each piece of cake must be placed on a plate.
3. Each plate must contain at least one piece.
4. No plate can have pieces from both cakes.
5. We want to maximize the minimum number of pieces on any plate.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function `func_1(n, a, b)` is designed to find the maximum value of `x` using binary search.
2. It sets `low` to 1 and `high` to `min(a, b) + 1`.
3. The loop continues until `low` is less than `high`, and it calculates a `mid` value to check if it can distribute the pieces such that each plate has at least `mid` pieces.
4. The `can_distribute(x)` function checks if the total number of pieces that can be distributed across the plates is at least `n`.

### Potential Issues:
- The `can_distribute(x)` function uses `a` and `b` directly, which are not passed as arguments. This means it relies on the global variables, which is not a good practice and can lead to issues if the function is called in a different context.
- The binary search logic does not seem to account for the case where `n > a + b`, which is stated in the problem constraints as not being possible. However, if the constraints were not enforced, the logic might fail.
- The program does not handle cases where `n` is larger than the total pieces of either cake, which could lead to incorrect results.

### Test Cases:
1. **Example Case:** For input `5 2 3`, the expected output is `1`. The code should correctly find that each plate can have at least 1 piece.
2. **Edge Case:** For input `3 2 2`, the expected output is `1`. The code should distribute the pieces as `1, 1, 1` across three plates.
3. **Problematic Case:** For input `5 1 1`, the expected output is `0` (since there are not enough pieces to give each plate at least one piece). However, since `n` is set to 5, the program will not be able to satisfy this condition.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw in how it handles the distribution of pieces, particularly when the number of plates exceeds the available pieces. Therefore, it does not correctly implement the conditions outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
