Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values for the number of digits and the bases for both numbers X and Y. It then reads the respective digits for both numbers.

2. **Conversion Function**: The `func_1` function converts the digit lists from their respective bases to decimal integers. This is done using a standard method for base conversion, where each digit is multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After both numbers are converted to their decimal representations, the program compares them using standard comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `=`) and prints the appropriate character based on the comparison.

The constraints and requirements specified in the problem are respected:
- The bases are different (as per the input constraints).
- The digits are within valid ranges for their respective bases.
- The program handles edge cases such as leading zeros and ensures both numbers are positive.

Given that the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all specified cases, I have not been able to identify any potential cases where it would fail. Thus, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
