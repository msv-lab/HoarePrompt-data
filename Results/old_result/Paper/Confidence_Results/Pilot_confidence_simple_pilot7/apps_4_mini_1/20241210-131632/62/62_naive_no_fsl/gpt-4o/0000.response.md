Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases. It reads the input values, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the decimal values. 

The conversion logic in `func_1` correctly computes the decimal value of a number given its digits and base by iterating through each digit and applying the base conversion formula. The comparisons using `<`, `>`, and `=` are also correctly implemented.

The program adheres to the problem description and handles all specified edge cases, such as varying lengths of the number representations and different bases. Since I cannot find any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.
