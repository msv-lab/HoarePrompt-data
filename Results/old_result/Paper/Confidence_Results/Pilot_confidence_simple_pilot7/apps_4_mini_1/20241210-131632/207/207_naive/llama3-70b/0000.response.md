To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and identify any potential edge cases that may not be handled correctly.

The problem requires calculating the number of distinct integers a frog can reach from position 0 on a number line, given the ability to jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`, and then summing this count for every integer from `0` to `m`.

The program attempts to use a dynamic programming approach to build an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach position `i`. However, there are several issues present in the implementation:

1. The logic for updating `dp[i]` when jumping backward is incorrect. The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` should not be adding ways to reach `i` from `i - b` since it doesn't represent the number of distinct integers reachable from `0`. Instead, it should be updating the reachable positions based on jumps made.

2. The program does not correctly account for the distinct reachable integers. The current implementation would incorrectly count the same position multiple times if it can be reached in different ways.

3. The algorithm runs in `O(m)`, which is inefficient for `m` up to `10^9`. The approach needs to be optimized to handle larger values of `m`.

4. The program does not handle cases where `a` and `b` lead to a situation where the frog cannot jump backward when it reaches a certain point.

### Example of a failing case:
Consider the input `m = 6`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`. The expected reachable positions would be:
- From `0`, the frog can jump to `4` (1 distinct integer).
- From `4`, the frog can jump back to `0` (already counted) or jump to `8`, which is outside the interval `[0, 6]`.
- The frog can also jump to `-1` from `0` (not allowed).
- Thus, the reachable integers are `0, 4`, leading to `f(0) = 1`, `f(1) = 1`, `f(2) = 1`, `f(3) = 1`, `f(4) = 2`, `f(5) = 2`, `f(6) = 2`, giving a total of `10`.

However, the current implementation does not correctly compute these values and will lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description and does not handle multiple edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **False**.
