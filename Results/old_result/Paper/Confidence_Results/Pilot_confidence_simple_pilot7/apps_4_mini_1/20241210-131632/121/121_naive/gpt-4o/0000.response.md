To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and check if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to replace unrecognized nucleotides (denoted by '?') in a string such that the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are equal. The key points from the problem description are:
1. The length of the string `n` must be divisible by 4.
2. Each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') must appear exactly `n / 4` times in the final string.
3. If it is not possible to achieve this, the program should print "===".

### Program Analysis
The program performs the following steps:
1. Checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If not, it prints "===" and returns.
2. Counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the input string.
3. Checks if any nucleotide exceeds the target count (which is `n / 4`). If so, it prints "===" and returns.
4. Replaces '?' in the string with the appropriate nucleotides to reach the target count for each nucleotide.
5. Finally, it prints the resulting string.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Case where `n` is divisible by 4 but all nucleotides are already at the target count:**
   - Input: `n = 8`, `s = "AACCGGTT"` should output `AACCGGTT` (which is correct).
   
2. **Case where `n` is divisible by 4 but cannot achieve the target count:**
   - Input: `n = 8`, `s = "AAAACCCC"` should output `===` since 'A' exceeds the target count.
   
3. **Case with only '?' characters:**
   - Input: `n = 8`, `s = "????????"` should output `ACGTACGT` (which is valid).
   
4. **Case where the number of '?' is not enough to balance the nucleotides:**
   - Input: `n = 8`, `s = "AA??CC??"` should output `ACGTACGT` (which is valid).
   - Input: `n = 8`, `s = "AAAACCCC??"` should output `===` as there are too many 'A's.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program against the problem description and considering various edge cases, the program correctly handles all specified scenarios. It checks for the divisibility of `n`, counts the nucleotides properly, and replaces '?' while ensuring the final counts are correct.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
