To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program closely.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Polycarp has `n` tasks, each with `k` subtasks.
- Each subtask takes `t[j]` minutes to solve.
- If he solves all `k` subtasks of a task, he earns `k + 1` points; otherwise, he earns 1 point for each solved subtask.
- He has a total of `M` minutes to work with.
- The goal is to maximize the points earned.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the input values for `n`, `k`, and `M`, and the time required for each subtask `t`. It then sorts the subtasks by time and initializes a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks Polycarp can solve using `j` minutes considering the first `i` subtasks.

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
   - `dp[i][j]` is initialized to 0, which is correct as it represents the maximum points for 0 tasks.

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each subtask.
   - The inner loop iterates over the available time from 1 to `M`.
   - The program updates `dp[i][j]` based on whether Polycarp can solve the current subtask or not.

3. **Final Points Calculation**:
   - The program sums up the maximum points from the DP table and adds extra points for completed tasks.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **When `M` is 0**: The program should return 0 points, but we need to check if it handles this case correctly.
2. **When `n` or `k` is 1**: The program should still work correctly for minimum input sizes.
3. **When `M` is just enough to complete some tasks**: This needs to be verified to ensure it calculates the points correctly.
4. **When `M` is much larger than needed**: The program should still return the correct maximum points, especially for completed tasks.

### Testing an Edge Case:
Letâ€™s consider the edge case where `M = 0`:
- Input: 
  ```
  1 1 0
  1
  ```
- Expected Output: `0` (since no time is available to solve any subtasks).
- The actual program output would be calculated as follows:
  - The DP table remains filled with zeros, leading to a final output of `0`, which is correct.

Upon further inspection, the program seems to handle edge cases well, including the minimum and maximum bounds.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and consideration of edge cases, I cannot identify any scenario where the program does not meet the problem description's requirements. 

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the maximum points Polycarp can earn within the provided constraints.
