To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program against the requirements stated.

### Problem Description Recap:
- You can delete contiguous substrings of equal characters.
- The goal is to calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the entire string.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. The program initializes `operations` to 1. This assumes that at least one operation is needed to start.
2. It iterates through the string starting from the second character (index 1).
3. For each character, it checks if it is different from the previous character. If it is different, it increments `operations`.
4. Finally, it prints the number of operations.

### Identifying Potential Issues:
- The program counts the number of transitions between different characters. However, it does not account for the fact that multiple contiguous characters can be removed in one operation.
- For example, in the string "aaabbb", the entire string can be deleted in one operation because both 'a' and 'b' are contiguous groups. The correct output should be 2 (one for 'aaa' and one for 'bbb').

### Test Case to Illustrate Failure:
Consider the input:
```
6
aaabbb
```
- The correct minimum number of operations to delete the string is 2 (remove "aaa" and then "bbb").
- However, the program would output 3 because it counts the transition from 'a' to 'b' as an additional operation.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle cases where contiguous equal characters can be deleted in a single operation, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
