To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to place `k` fishes in a pond of size `n × m` such that the expected number of caught fishes when using a scoop of size `r × r` is maximized. The scoop can be placed in `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)` different positions, and the output should be the maximum expected value of caught fishes.

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads four integers: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`.
2. **Calculating Maximum Caught Fishes**: 
   - `ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` determines the maximum number of fishes that can be caught. This is correct because it ensures that we do not count more fishes than we can place in the pond.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: 
   - The expected number of caught fishes is calculated as `ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`. This is also correct since it divides the number of fishes that can be caught by the total number of possible positions of the scoop.

### Potential Edge Cases
- If `k` exceeds the total number of cells in the pond (`n * m`), the program correctly limits the number of fishes to the maximum number of cells that can hold fishes.
- However, if `k` is less than the total number of possible positions of the scoop, the expected value could be less than the maximum possible fishes that can be caught in some configurations. The program does not consider the optimal placement of fishes within the scoop's range.

### Example of Failure
Consider the case where:
- Input: `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, `k = 2`
- The scoop can be placed in 4 positions: 
  - Position (1,1) captures fishes in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)
  - Position (1,2) captures fishes in (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)
  - Position (2,1) captures fishes in (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)
  - Position (2,2) captures fishes in (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)

If we place fishes optimally (for instance, at (1,1) and (1,2)), the expected value of caught fishes is not correctly calculated since the program just divides the number of fishes by the number of positions without considering their distribution.

### Conclusion
Due to the lack of consideration for the optimal placement of fishes in relation to the scoop's positions and the possible configurations that could yield a higher expected value, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**.
