To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: height of the pond.
   - `m`: width of the pond.
   - `r`: size of the scoop-net (both dimensions).
   - `k`: number of fishes to place in the pond.

2. **Outputs**:
   - The program is supposed to calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes when the scoop-net is placed in a random position.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The total number of positions for the scoop-net is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.
   - The maximum number of fishes that can be caught is limited by the number of fishes placed (`k`) and the number of valid scoop-net positions.

### Program Logic
```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))
```

- The program calculates the minimum of `k` (the number of fishes to be placed) and the total number of scoop-net positions `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. This is correct as it determines how many fishes can be caught based on the positions available.
- The expected value is then calculated by dividing the number of fishes that can be caught by the total number of positions.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Values**: 
   - If `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `r = 1`, `k = 1`, the output should be `1.0`. The program correctly handles this case.
   
2. **Maximum Values**:
   - If `n = 10^5`, `m = 10^5`, `r = 1`, `k = 10^5`, the expected value should be `1.0` since every position can have a fish. The program should also handle this correctly.

3. **Cases where `k` is larger than possible positions**: 
   - If `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, `k = 10`, the program should calculate the maximum fishes that can be caught as `min(10, (3 - 2 + 1) * (3 - 2 + 1)) = min(10, 2) = 2`, leading to an expected value of `2 / 4 = 0.5`. The program does this correctly.

### Conclusion
The program successfully calculates the expected number of caught fishes for all tested cases and adheres to the problem's requirements. 

Correctness: **True** 

The program covers all edge cases and computes the expected value accurately as per the problem's description.
