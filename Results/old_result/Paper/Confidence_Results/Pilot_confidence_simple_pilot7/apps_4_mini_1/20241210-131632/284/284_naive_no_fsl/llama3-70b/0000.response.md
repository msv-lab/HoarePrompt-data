Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw because it attempts to print the first value of `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. However, the function `func_1` is defined after the loop, meaning it will not be recognized when the loop runs. This leads to a `NameError` when the program is executed.

Additionally, the program does not guarantee that it will find an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for all possible values of `n` within the specified range (1 to 1000). Even though the problem description states that a counterexample exists, the program's structure does not ensure that it will execute correctly due to the placement of the function definition.

Here's a specific case that illustrates the problem:
- If `n = 1`, the program will try to evaluate `1 * m + 1`, which results in `m + 1`. For `m = 1`, `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (which is prime), and for `m = 2`, `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (which is also prime). The program will fail to find a non-prime number because it encounters a `NameError` before it can evaluate any expression.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not properly handle the logic and structure required to find a counterexample.
