Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in its implementation. Specifically, the function `func_1` is defined after it is called in the loop, which will cause a `NameError` when trying to execute the program. This means that the program will fail to run successfully for any input.

Furthermore, even if the function was defined correctly, there is a potential edge case that needs to be considered. For example, if `n = 1`, then the program will evaluate `1 * m + 1` for `m = 1` to `1000`. The result will always be `m + 1`, which is always even (and greater than 2) for all odd values of `m`, hence not prime. However, for `m = 1`, it results in `2`, which is prime. The program would not find a counterexample in that case.

Thus, since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and has a critical error in its structure, the correctness of the program is false.
