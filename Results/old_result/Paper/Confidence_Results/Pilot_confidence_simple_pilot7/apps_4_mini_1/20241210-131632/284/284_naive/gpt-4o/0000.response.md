To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it handles all cases as expected.

The problem requires finding a positive integer `m` such that the expression `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, for a given positive integer `n`. The program iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and checks if `n * m + 1` is not a prime number using the `func_1` function.

Now let's examine the `func_1` function and the main logic:

1. **Prime Checking Logic**: 
   - The function correctly identifies non-prime numbers for `x <= 1` and handles small primes and even numbers effectively.
   - For larger numbers, it uses a trial division method which is efficient for the range of numbers likely to be encountered in this problem.

2. **Looping through m**: 
   - The loop runs from `m = 1` to `m = 1000`, which is within the specified limit.
   - The program breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds one suitable `m`, which is efficient.

3. **Guarantee of Existence**: 
   - The problem states that it is guaranteed that a solution exists, meaning there will always be some `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime for the given `n`.

Now, let's consider edge cases:

- If `n = 1`, then for `m = 1`, `1 * 1 + 1 = 2`, which is prime. For `m = 2`, `1 * 2 + 1 = 3`, which is also prime. Continuing this up to `m = 1000`, we will find that `1 * m + 1` results in a prime number for all `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000`. However, if we check for `m = 3`, `1 * 3 + 1 = 4`, which is not prime. Thus, the loop will correctly find `m = 3`.

- If `n = 2`, for `m = 1`, `2 * 1 + 1 = 3` (prime), for `m = 2`, `2 * 2 + 1 = 5` (prime), for `m = 3`, `2 * 3 + 1 = 7` (prime), and so on. However, for `m = 4`, `2 * 4 + 1 = 9` (not prime). The program will find `m = 4`.

- The program will always find an `m` because there will always be a number in the form `n * m + 1` that is not prime due to the nature of integers and primes.

Given all the checks and the guarantees provided in the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic needed to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis.

Therefore, after careful consideration of the logic and potential edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly identifies a suitable `m` for any input `n` within the specified range, ensuring that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number.
