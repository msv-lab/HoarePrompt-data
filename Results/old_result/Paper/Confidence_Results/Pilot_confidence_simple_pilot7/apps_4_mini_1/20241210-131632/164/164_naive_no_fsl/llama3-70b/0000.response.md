Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case correctly when the grasshopper and the insect are positioned such that the grasshopper cannot reach the insect due to obstacles, even if the jump distance allows for a valid jump. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5 2
G#T..
```
In this case, the grasshopper (G) is at index 0, and the insect (T) is at index 2. The grasshopper can jump 2 cells to the right to index 2, but there is an obstacle (#) at index 1. The program would incorrectly return "YES" because it checks the condition based on the modulo operation without accounting for the obstacles in between.

The check:
```python
all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))
```
will not correctly identify that the grasshopper cannot jump to the target due to the obstacle in between, leading to an incorrect output. 

Thus, the program fails to consider all edge cases where obstacles might block the path, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.
