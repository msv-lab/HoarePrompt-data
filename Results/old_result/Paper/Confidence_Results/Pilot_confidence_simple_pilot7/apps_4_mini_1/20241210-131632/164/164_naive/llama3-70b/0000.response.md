To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a line of `n` cells with obstacles (`#`), an initial position of the grasshopper (`G`), and a target insect (`T`).
- The grasshopper can jump exactly `k` cells to the left or right.
- We need to determine if the grasshopper can reach the insect without landing on obstacles.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The first line reads `n` (number of cells) and `k` (jump length).
   - The second line reads the string representing the cells.

2. **Finding Positions**:
   - The program correctly identifies the positions of `G` and `T` using a loop.

3. **Checking Reachability**:
   - It checks if the absolute difference between `G` and `T` is divisible by `k` (i.e., `abs(t - g) % k == 0`).
   - It then checks if there are any obstacles in the path of the grasshopper's jumps using a generator expression that checks every `k`-th cell from `G` to `T`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case of Obstacles Blocking the Path**: 
   - If `k` is 1, the grasshopper can only jump to adjacent cells. If there are obstacles directly between `G` and `T`, the grasshopper should not be able to reach the insect.
   - For instance, with input:
     ```
     5 1
     G#T..
     ```
     Here, the grasshopper cannot jump past the obstacle `#`, and the expected output is "NO", which the program handles correctly.

- **Case of Non-Divisible Distance**:
   - If the distance between `G` and `T` is not divisible by `k`, the grasshopper should not be able to reach the insect.
   - For example, with input:
     ```
     5 2
     G...T
     ```
     The distance is 4, and 4 is not divisible by 2, so the expected output is "NO", which the program handles correctly.

- **Case of No Obstacles**:
   - If there are no obstacles and the distance is divisible by `k`, the grasshopper should reach the insect.
   - For instance:
     ```
     5 2
     G...T
     ```
     Should output "YES", and the program handles this correctly.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles the necessary checks for obstacles, distance divisibility, and correctly outputs the result.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
