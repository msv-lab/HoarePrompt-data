To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

The program intends to evaluate the voting results based on three inputs: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes). The expected outputs are:
- "+" if upvotes are guaranteed to be greater than downvotes.
- "-" if downvotes are guaranteed to be greater than upvotes.
- "0" if upvotes and downvotes are equal.
- "?" if there are multiple possible outcomes due to the unknown votes.

### Analyzing the Program Logic

1. **Inputs**: The program correctly reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`.
2. **Calculating Ranges**:
   - `min_upvotes` is set to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is `x + z`.
   - `min_downvotes` is set to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is `y + z`.

3. **Conditions**:
   - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `'-'`, indicating that downvotes will always be more than upvotes.
   - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `'+'`, indicating that upvotes will always be more than downvotes.
   - If neither of the above conditions holds true, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty.

### Testing Edge Cases

Letâ€™s consider the edge cases based on the problem description:

- **Case 1**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
  - Here, `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
  - The possible outcomes are:
    - If the unknown vote is an upvote: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes -> Result is `+`.
    - If the unknown vote is a downvote: 0 upvotes, 1 downvote -> Result is `-`.
  - The program should output `'?'`, which it does correctly.

- **Case 2**: `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`
  - Here, `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`.
  - The only outcome is `-` since 3 is less than 7. The program outputs `'-'`, which is correct.

- **Case 3**: `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
  - Here, `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
  - The outcomes are:
    - If the unknown vote is an upvote: 3 upvotes, 0 downvotes -> Result is `+`.
    - If the unknown vote is a downvote: 2 upvotes, 1 downvote -> Result is still `+`.
  - The program should output `'+'`, which it does correctly.

- **Case 4**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
  - Here, `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
  - The only outcome is `0` since both are equal. The program outputs `'0'`, which is correct.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program against the provided problem description and potential edge cases, the program works correctly for all tested scenarios. It accurately determines when the result is uncertain and when it is guaranteed.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program handles all cases as described, with correct outputs for each scenario presented in the problem statement.
