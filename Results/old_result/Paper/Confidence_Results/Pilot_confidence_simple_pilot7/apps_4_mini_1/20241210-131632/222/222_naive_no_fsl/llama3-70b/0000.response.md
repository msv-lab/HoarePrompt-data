To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

### Problem Understanding:
1. We have `n` skewers, and when we turn skewer `i`, it affects `k` skewers on each side, plus skewer `i` itself.
2. The goal is to determine the minimum number of actions required to turn over all `n` skewers.
3. The output should be the number of actions followed by the specific skewers turned.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program attempts to calculate the minimum number of actions (`l`) needed to turn over all skewers. It uses the formula:
```python
l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
```
This formula calculates how many groups of skewers can be turned over in one action, where each action affects `k * 2 + 1` skewers.

The program then generates the list of skewers to turn over:
```python
for i in range(l):
    res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
```
This logic aims to select the first skewer of each group.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **When `k = 0`**: Each action only affects the skewer itself. Thus, `l` should equal `n`, and the output should be the numbers from `1` to `n`.
2. **When `n` is less than `k * 2 + 1`**: In this case, a single action should suffice, and it should turn all skewers.
3. **When `n` is odd and `k` is not zero**: The distribution of skewers turned may need to be carefully considered to ensure all are turned.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Let's test some specific cases:

1. **Case 1**: `n = 1`, `k = 0`
   - Expected output: `1` (only skewer 1)
   - Program output: `1` (skewers turned: [1])
   
2. **Case 2**: `n = 5`, `k = 0`
   - Expected output: `5` (turn skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   - Program output: `5` (skewers turned: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

3. **Case 3**: `n = 6`, `k = 1`
   - Expected output: `2` (turn skewers 2 and 5)
   - Program output: `2` (skewers turned: [1, 4]) - Incorrect, as it does not turn skewer 3.

4. **Case 4**: `n = 7`, `k = 2`
   - Expected output: `2` (turn skewers 1 and 5)
   - Program output: `2` (skewers turned: [1, 6]) - Incorrect, as it does not turn skewers 2, 3, 4.

### Conclusion:
The program fails in specific scenarios, particularly when `k` is greater than `0`, as it does not ensure all skewers are turned over correctly. Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
