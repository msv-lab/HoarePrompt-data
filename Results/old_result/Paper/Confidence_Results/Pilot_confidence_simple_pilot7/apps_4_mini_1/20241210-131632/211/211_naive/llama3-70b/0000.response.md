To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step and identify any potential issues.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`. This part seems fine.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums of the array. This is necessary to determine if any subarrays can have a sum of zero.

3. **Zero Sum Check**: The program checks if the total sum of the array is zero. If it is, it prints "NO", which aligns with the problem description.

4. **Finding Subarrays**: The program attempts to find subarrays where the prefix sum is not zero and does not equal the total prefix sum. However, there is an issue in the logic used to determine the subarrays.

   - The condition `if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` is problematic because:
     - It only checks for non-zero prefix sums but does not ensure that the subarrays formed actually have a non-zero sum. It could potentially skip valid partitions.
     - Specifically, if the prefix sum at some index `r` is equal to the total sum, it may not correctly handle cases where a valid subarray can be formed right before that index.

5. **Output of Subarrays**: The way subarrays are printed may not correctly reflect the required conditions in all cases. For example, if the array has a structure where the prefix sums oscillate around zero, it could lead to incorrect or incomplete subarray outputs.

### Test Case to Illustrate Failure:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 -1 2 -2 3
```
- The prefix sums would be `[0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3]`.
- The total sum is `3`, which is not zero, so it would print "YES".
- However, the logic in the loop may not correctly identify that we can have subarrays like:
  - (1, 1) -> sum = 1
  - (2, 2) -> sum = -1
  - (3, 3) -> sum = 2
  - (4, 4) -> sum = -2
  - (5, 5) -> sum = 3
- The program might not output the expected partitions correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic for determining valid subarrays, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
