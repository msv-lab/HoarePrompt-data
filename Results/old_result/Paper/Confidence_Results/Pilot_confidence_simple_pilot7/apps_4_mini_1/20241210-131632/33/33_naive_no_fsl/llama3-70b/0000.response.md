Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where Limak moves "West" or "East" while at the North Pole or South Pole correctly. According to the problem description, Limak can only move "South" from the North Pole and "North" from the South Pole. However, the program allows Limak to move "West" or "East" without any checks, which is not allowed when he is at either pole.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
1000 West
1000 South
```
In this case, Limak starts at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude) and attempts to move "West" first, which is not allowed according to the problem description. The program would incorrectly output "YES" because it doesn't check for invalid movements to the West or East at the poles.

This demonstrates that the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
