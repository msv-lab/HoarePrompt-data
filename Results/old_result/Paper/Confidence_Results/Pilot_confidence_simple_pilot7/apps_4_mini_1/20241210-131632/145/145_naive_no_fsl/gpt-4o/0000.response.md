To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The program needs to check if a sequence of digits can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums.
2. Each segment must consist of one or more digits, and all digits must be used exactly once.

### Code Analysis:
- The code defines a function `func_1` that iterates over possible segment lengths.
- For each segment length, it calculates the target sum of the first segment.
- It then iterates through the digits, accumulating their sum and checking if it matches the target sum.
- If it matches, it resets the current sum and increments the segment count.
- If at the end of the iteration, the current sum is zero and the segment count is greater than one, it returns 'YES'.
- If no valid segmentation is found, it returns 'NO'.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Input Case**: For `n = 2`, the only possible segments are the two digits themselves. If they are equal, the output should be 'NO' because we need at least two segments.
2. **All Zeros**: A ticket like `0000` should return 'YES' because it can be divided into any number of segments of zero sum.
3. **Single Segment**: A case like `1234` should return 'NO' as it cannot be divided into two segments with equal sums.
4. **Equal Digits**: A ticket like `1111` can be divided into segments of `1`, `1`, and `1`, so it should return 'YES'.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- For input `2` and ticket `11`, the output should be 'NO'.
- For input `4` and ticket `0000`, the output should be 'YES'.
- For input `4` and ticket `1234`, the output should be 'NO'.
- For input `4` and ticket `1111`, the output should be 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
Looking through the code, the logic seems to account for segmenting the ticket correctly. However, it fails to handle the case where the only possible segments are the digits themselves (like `11`), where it should return 'NO' instead of 'YES'. 

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
