Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that Nikolay can use to make the compote in the specified ratio of 1:2:4.

Here's how the program works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits:
   - Each lemon requires 2 apples and 4 pears.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of lemons that can be used is determined by:
     - `a` (the number of lemons available),
     - `b // 2` (the maximum number of lemons that can be supported by the available apples),
     - `c // 4` (the maximum number of lemons that can be supported by the available pears).
3. The minimum of these three values is calculated, which gives the maximum number of lemons that can actually be used (`min_lemon`).
4. Finally, it computes the total number of fruits used as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which corresponds to the total number of lemons, apples, and pears used in the compote.

The program handles edge cases correctly:
- If Nikolay has insufficient fruits to meet the ratio requirements (for example, not enough pears), `min_lemon` will be 0, resulting in a total output of 0.
- The constraints of the problem (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000) are respected, and the program will not attempt to divide by zero or access negative indices.

Therefore, since the program accurately reflects the problem requirements and handles all potential edge cases correctly, the correctness is confirmed as **True**.
