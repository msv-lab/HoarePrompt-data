To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements of the problem description under all potential cases. 

The problem states that we need to find the smallest square frame that encompasses all the white pixels ('w') on the monitor, ensuring that the frame does not extend beyond the monitor's borders and that all white pixels are located on the frame.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the dimensions of the monitor and the state of each pixel.

2. **Finding White Pixels**: The program collects the coordinates of all white pixels into the list `white_pixels`.

3. **Calculating Frame Bounds**: It calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels to determine the bounding box.

4. **Frame Size Calculation**: The frame size is determined based on the maximum width and height required to cover all white pixels.

5. **Frame Placement**: The program attempts to place the frame by iterating through the pixel grid and replacing appropriate pixels with '+'.

6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the modified grid.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Frame Size Validation**: The condition `if frame_size > max(n, m)` checks if the frame size exceeds the monitor dimensions. However, this doesn't account for cases where the frame might fit within the dimensions but still not be valid due to the placement of white pixels.

2. **Frame Placement Logic**: The logic for placing the frame only checks if the pixel is on the boundary of the calculated frame. However, it does not ensure that all white pixels are on the frame. For example, if the white pixels are arranged in a way that they cannot be encompassed by a valid frame, the program will still attempt to place a frame.

3. **Case of Isolated White Pixels**: If the white pixels are isolated (like a single 'w' in the center of the grid), the frame size might be incorrectly calculated or placed.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
3 3
.w.
...
.w.
```
In this case, the program will calculate the bounding box and determine a frame size of 3. However, when it attempts to place the frame, it should recognize that a frame cannot be drawn around the isolated 'w' pixels without extending beyond the monitor's borders or overlapping with the black pixels. The expected output should be `-1`, but the program may incorrectly attempt to place a frame.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly with the frame placement logic and the conditions that do not cover all potential cases, the program does not meet the problem requirements in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
