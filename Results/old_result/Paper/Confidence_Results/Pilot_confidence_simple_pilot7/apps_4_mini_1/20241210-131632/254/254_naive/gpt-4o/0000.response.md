To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

The problem description states that Mishka wants to switch on three garlands such that at least one garland is lit during every second after switching them on. The garlands have periodic lighting intervals defined by k1, k2, and k3. The goal is to determine if there exist moments x1, x2, and x3 such that for every second after the maximum of these moments, at least one garland is lit.

The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the intervals k1, k2, and k3. If the GCD is 1, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The reasoning behind this is that if the GCD is greater than 1, there will be some seconds when none of the garlands are lit, as they will all be synchronized to be off at certain intervals.

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **Case with k1 = 1, k2 = 1, k3 = 1**: 
   - GCD(1, 1, 1) = 1, so the output should be "YES". This is correct.

2. **Case with k1 = 2, k2 = 2, k3 = 2**: 
   - GCD(2, 2, 2) = 2, so the output should be "NO". This is correct.

3. **Case with k1 = 3, k2 = 5, k3 = 7**: 
   - GCD(3, 5, 7) = 1, so the output should be "YES". This is correct.

4. **Case with k1 = 4, k2 = 2, k3 = 3**: 
   - GCD(4, 2, 3) = 1, so the output should be "YES". This is correct.

5. **Case with k1 = 6, k2 = 12, k3 = 18**: 
   - GCD(6, 12, 18) = 6, so the output should be "NO". This is correct.

However, the logic of using GCD to determine whether the garlands can be lit continuously is flawed. The GCD only indicates the largest step at which they can all be off simultaneously but does not guarantee that the intervals can be arranged to cover all seconds after a certain point.

For example, consider:
- **Case with k1 = 2, k2 = 3, k3 = 4**:
  - The GCD is 1, and the output would be "YES". However, if we switch on garland 1 at x1=1, garland 2 at x2=1, and garland 3 at x3=1, they will light up at different intervals but will not cover every second after the maximum. There will be seconds where no garland is lit, such as at second 5.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the requirement that at least one garland must be lit at every second after the maximum of x1, x2, and x3.

Correctness: **False**.
