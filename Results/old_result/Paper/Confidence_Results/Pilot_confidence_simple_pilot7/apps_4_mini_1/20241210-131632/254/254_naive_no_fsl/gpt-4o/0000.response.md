Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly determines whether it is possible for Mishka to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of the chosen times. The logic used in the program relies on calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the time intervals of the garlands. 

The correct approach should consider whether the three garlands can cover every second after a certain point. The GCD condition used in the program is not sufficient to guarantee that every second is covered. For example, consider the input `4 2 3`. 

- Here, the GCD of `4`, `2`, and `3` is `1`, which the program would interpret as "YES", suggesting that it is possible to cover all seconds. However, if we analyze the intervals:
  - The garland with interval `4` lights up at seconds `4, 8, 12, ...`
  - The garland with interval `2` lights up at seconds `2, 4, 6, 8, ...`
  - The garland with interval `3` lights up at seconds `3, 6, 9, ...`
  
  In this case, there is a gap at second `1`, and after that, there is a gap at second `5` where no garland is lit at that specific second. Thus, it is impossible to ensure that at least one garland is lit during every second after the chosen times. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as specified in the description.
