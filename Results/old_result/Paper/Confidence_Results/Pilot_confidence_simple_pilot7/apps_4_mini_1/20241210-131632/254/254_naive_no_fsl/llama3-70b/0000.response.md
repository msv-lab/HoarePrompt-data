To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

The problem states that Mishka wants to ensure that at least one garland is lit at every second after he switches them on. The garlands have different time intervals (k1, k2, k3) at which they light up. The goal is to check if there exists a way to choose moments (x1, x2, x3) such that every second after the maximum of these moments has at least one garland lit.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Calculating LCM**: The code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals k1, k2, and k3 using a formula that involves the greatest common divisor (GCD) through the `func_1` function.

2. **Checking Conditions**: After calculating the LCM, the code checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the intervals (k1, k2, and k3). If it is, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Potential Issues:

1. **Logic Flaw in Conditions**: The logic in the condition `if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0)` is flawed because it implies that for the garlands to cover every second after the maximum moment, they must all light up at the same time (the LCM). However, the problem does not require all garlands to light up at the same time; it merely requires that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of x1, x2, and x3.

2. **Counterexamples**: For example, consider the input `4 2 3`. The program would output "NO" because 12 (the LCM of 4, 2, and 3) is not divisible by 4. However, if we choose x1 = 1, x2 = 2, and x3 = 1, the garlands would light up as follows:
   - Garland 1 (k1=4): lit at seconds 1, 5, 9, ...
   - Garland 2 (k2=2): lit at seconds 2, 4, 6, 8, ...
   - Garland 3 (k3=3): lit at seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ...
   
   In this case, there are seconds where at least one garland is lit (for example, at second 1, 2, 4, etc.), showing that it is indeed possible to choose moments such that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of x1, x2, x3.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem. It fails to account for the possibility of different combinations of x1, x2, and x3 that can satisfy the condition of at least one garland being lit at every second.

Correctness: **False**
