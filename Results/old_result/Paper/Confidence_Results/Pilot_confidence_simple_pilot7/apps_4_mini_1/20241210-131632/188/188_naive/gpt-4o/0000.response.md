To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program against the requirements.

### Program Analysis

The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of cards. It then reads `n` integers which are the numbers on the cards. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number.

1. If there are fewer than 2 unique numbers, it prints "NO" since Petya and Vasya cannot choose distinct numbers.
2. It checks if the two most common numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times. If they do, the game is fair, and it prints "YES" followed by the two numbers.
3. If the above condition is not met, it prints "NO".

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **All cards the same**: If all cards have the same number, the output should be "NO". The program handles this correctly by checking the length of unique numbers.
   - Example: Input `4` followed by `6, 6, 6, 6` should yield "NO".

2. **Two distinct numbers with unequal counts**: If there are two distinct numbers but one appears more than `n // 2` times, the output should be "NO". The program checks if the two most common numbers have equal counts of `n // 2`, which is correct.
   - Example: Input `4` followed by `1, 1, 2, 2` should yield "YES" (correctly).

3. **Three or more distinct numbers**: The program only considers the two most common numbers. If there are more than two numbers, but the two most common do not meet the criteria, it will correctly print "NO".
   - Example: Input `6` followed by `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3` should yield "NO".

4. **Exactly two distinct numbers with equal counts**: If there are exactly two distinct numbers and they each appear `n // 2` times, the program should print "YES".
   - Example: Input `4` followed by `3, 3, 4, 4` should yield "YES".

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if a fair game is possible based on the criteria given in the problem description. It handles all edge cases that arise from the constraints and requirements provided.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly identifies whether Petya and Vasya can choose numbers such that the game is fair under all specified conditions.
