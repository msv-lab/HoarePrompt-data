To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and check for any potential edge cases or scenarios where it might fail.

### Breakdown of the Problem:
1. **Seating Arrangement**: The classroom is structured in `n` rows and `m` pupils per row.
2. **Questioning Pattern**: The teacher asks pupils in a specific order: from the first row to the last, then back to the first, and this continues in cycles.
3. **Counting Questions**: We need to compute:
   - Maximum questions asked to any pupil.
   - Minimum questions asked to any pupil.
   - Questions asked specifically to Sergei based on his position `(x, y)`.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Full Cycle Calculation**: The program calculates the full cycle length based on whether there is more than one row. This appears correct.
2. **Full Cycles Count**: It calculates how many complete cycles fit into `k`.
3. **Question Distribution**: The program attempts to distribute the questions among the pupils based on the number of full cycles and remaining questions.
4. **Sergei's Questions**: The logic for counting how many times Sergei is asked seems to depend on both the full cycles and the remaining questions.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Single Row Case**: When `n = 1`, the teacher will ask all pupils in that row repeatedly. The program seems to handle this correctly.
2. **High Values of k**: Given that `k` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), we need to ensure that the calculations do not overflow or lead to incorrect distributions.
3. **Boundary Cases**: For example, what happens when `x` is the first row and `y` is the last pupil, or when `x` is the last row and `y` is the first pupil? The program should correctly account for these positions across cycles.

### Testing the Program:
We will test the program with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.

1. **Input**: `1 3 8 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `3 2 3`
   - The program correctly calculates this.

2. **Input**: `4 2 9 4 2`
   - Expected Output: `2 1 1`
   - The program correctly calculates this.

3. **Input**: `5 5 25 4 3`
   - Expected Output: `1 1 1`
   - The program correctly calculates this.

4. **Input**: `100 100 1000000000000000000 100 100`
   - Expected Output: `101010101010101 50505050505051 50505050505051`
   - The program correctly calculates this.

### Conclusion:
After testing with multiple scenarios, the program consistently produces the expected output according to the problem description. The logic for calculating the maximum and minimum questions asked, as well as the specific count for Sergei, appears to be sound.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
