To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

The problem requires finding three integer points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The program first checks if this area is an integer and greater than zero. If not, it prints "NO". If the area is valid, it proceeds to find points based on certain conditions.

### Analyzing the Code Logic

1. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area is calculated as \( \text{area} = \frac{n \times m}{k} \).
   - It checks if the area is an integer by comparing it to its integer conversion.

2. **Area Validity**:
   - If the area is zero or not an integer, it prints "NO".

3. **Point Generation**:
   - The program attempts to generate points based on the value of \( 2 \times \text{area} \) and compares it with \( n \) and \( m \).

### Potential Issues

1. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area can be validly calculated as an integer, but it may not necessarily lead to valid points within the bounds \( 0 \leq x_i \leq n \) and \( 0 \leq y_i \leq m \).

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( k \) is larger than \( n \times m \), the area becomes less than 1, which might lead to invalid triangle configurations.
   - The code does not account for cases where \( 2 \times \text{area} \) exceeds both \( n \) and \( m \), which could lead to invalid points being generated.

### Example Case for Failure

Let's consider an example where \( n = 1 \), \( m = 1 \), and \( k = 2 \):
- Area calculation: \( \text{area} = \frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5 \) (not an integer, should print "NO").
- But if we check the conditions for \( k = 2 \), it should lead to valid points if handled correctly, which it does not appear to do.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly edge cases where the area calculation leads to invalid or impossible point configurations. Therefore, we have found cases where the program fails to adhere to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
