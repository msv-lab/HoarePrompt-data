Example Answer:
The value of `remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`. The value of `n` is unknown, but it is subtracted by the value of `c[j]`. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is assigned the value of `k`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`.
Output State: **`j` is assigned the value of `k`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`**
