Example Answer:
`time_with_both_spells` is calculated by multiplying the value of `remaining_potions` with `a[i]`. The value of `remaining_potions` is calculated based on the value of `n` and `c[j]`. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **No changes to the variables `i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, or `remaining_manapoints`. `j` is assigned the value of `k`. `time_with_both_spells` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `c[j]`, and `a[i]`.**
