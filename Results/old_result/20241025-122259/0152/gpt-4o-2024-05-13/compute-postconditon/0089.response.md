Output State: After the loop execution, if `j` is initially assigned the value of `k`, the loop will not be entered as `j` is required to be less than 0. Therefore, the output state will be that all variables remain the same, and the loop does not execute. `j` retains the initial value of `k`, and the values of remaining variables remain unchanged.
