According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than 0. However, the initial value of `i` is not given. Since the loop does not execute and all variables remain the same, we can assume that `i` is already less than 0. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **All variables remain the same, and the loop does not execute. `j` retains the initial value of `k`, and the values of remaining variables remain unchanged.**
