Example Answer:
`min_time` is assigned the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j`, `d` are integers, `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]; `time_with_both_spells` is assigned the calculated value, and `min_time` is updated accordingly.
