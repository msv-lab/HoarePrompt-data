According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `j` is incremented by 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to a value less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All variables remain integers, the value of `j` is less than 0**
