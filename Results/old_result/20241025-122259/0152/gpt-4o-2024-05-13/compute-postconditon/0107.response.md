Example Answer:
If `num` is divisible by 2, then it will be updated to `num` divided by 2. If `num` is not divisible by 2, then it will be updated to 3 times `num` plus 1. After that, `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is either updated based on the conditions described above, and `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`num` is either updated based on the conditions described above, and `j` is increased by 1**
