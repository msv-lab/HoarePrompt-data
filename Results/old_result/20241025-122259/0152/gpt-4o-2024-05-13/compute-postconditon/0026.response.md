According to the code, the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `n * a[i]`, `i` is less than 0**
