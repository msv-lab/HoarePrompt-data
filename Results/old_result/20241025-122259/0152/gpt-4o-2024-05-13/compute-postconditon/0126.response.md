Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[0])`, where `data[0]` is the first element of the split input values. If the first element is a valid integer, then `n` will be assigned that integer value. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value**
