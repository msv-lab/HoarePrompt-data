Postcondition: **`i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j`, `d` are integers. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`. `time_with_both_spells` is computed as the product of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`. `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. If `d[j]` is not less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, the loop breaks after updating the necessary variables. `j` is increased by 1 until it becomes less than 0.**
