Example Answer: 
`k` is assigned the value of the third element of `data` converted to an integer. The value of the third element of `data` is unknown, but `n` is an integer and `m` is extracted from the second element of `data`, so `k` will be an integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`, and `k` is an integer value.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`, and `k` is an integer value**
