Example Answer:
The value of `remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`. The value of `n`, `c[j]` are given as integers in the initial state. The remaining variables are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers, `d` is a list of integers, `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`.
Output State: **`i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers, `d` is a list of integers, `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]**
