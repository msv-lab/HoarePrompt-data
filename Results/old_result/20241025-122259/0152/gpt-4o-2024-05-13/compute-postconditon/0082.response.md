Example Answer:
The variable `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`. Since the value of `j` is less than 0, the output state will depend on the initial values of `n` and `c[j]`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `c[j]`, then `remaining_potions` will be the result of `n - c[j]`, otherwise, it will be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain integers, the value of `j` is less than 0, and `remaining_potions` is calculated based on the value of `n` and `c[j]`.
Output State: **All variables remain integers, the value of `j` is less than 0, and `remaining_potions` is calculated based on the value of `n` and `c[j]**.
