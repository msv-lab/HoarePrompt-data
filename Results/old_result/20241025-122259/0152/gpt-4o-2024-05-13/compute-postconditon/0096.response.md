Example Answer: 
`time_with_both_spells` is calculated by multiplying `remaining_potions` with `a[i]`. The value of `remaining_potions` is determined by taking the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is equal to `k`, `remaining_manapoints` is calculated as `s - b[i]`, `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`, and `time_with_both_spells` is calculated based on the aforementioned values.
