Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and the result of the expression `(n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t`. The values of `n`, `cnt`, and `t` are not provided, so the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `num1` and `num2` are integers.
Output State: **`num1` and `num2` are integers**
