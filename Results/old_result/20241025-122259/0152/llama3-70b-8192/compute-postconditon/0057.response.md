Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of list `a` is assigned to variable `t`. The variable `i` is increased by 2, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `num1` and `num2` are integers, `i` is increased by 2, and `t` is assigned the value at index `i` of list `a`.
Output State: **`num1` and `num2` are integers, `i` is increased by 2, and `t` is assigned the value at index `i` of list `a`**
