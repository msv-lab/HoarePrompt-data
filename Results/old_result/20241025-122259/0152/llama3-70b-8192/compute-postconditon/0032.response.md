Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned the value of `x`, but the initial state of `x` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 0, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j]`, `ans` is updated based on the comparison, `i` is -1, `t` is assigned the value of `x`.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j]`, `ans` is updated based on the comparison, `i` is -1, `t` is assigned the value of `x`**
