Example Answer: 
`a1` and `b1` are assigned values based on the input provided through `input().split()`. The values of `a1` and `b1` will be integers within the range of 1 to 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` and `b1` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000.
Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000**
