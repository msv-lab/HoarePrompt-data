Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('NO')` simply prints 'NO' to the console and does not affect any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000, `a2` and `b2` are input integers, `a3` and `b3` are input integers**
