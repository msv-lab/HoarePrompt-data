You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000.
```
def func(a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3):
```
Output: Case_1: A `StopIteration` exception could be triggered at `w2, h2, w3, h3 = next(iterator)` if there are no more items to iterate through. If such an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of the variables do not change. The function does not return any value in this case.

Therefore, the output state is: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; possible_orientations is a list of four tuples with different combinations of a2, b2, a3, b3. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of the variables do not change.**

Case_2: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with different combinations of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`, and `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned the values from the next tuple in the iterator. If the sum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the maximum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, or the maximum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the sum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, the function returns 'YES'.

Case_3: Unknown

Case_4: a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, possible_orientations

Case_5: a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, possible_orientations

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
