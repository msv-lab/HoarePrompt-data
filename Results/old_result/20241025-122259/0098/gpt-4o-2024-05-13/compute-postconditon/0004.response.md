Postcondition: **`a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, w2, h2, w3, h3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000. `possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with different combinations of `a2, b2, a3, b3`. If the sum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the maximum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, or the maximum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the sum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, the function returns 'YES'.**
Precondition: `name` is a string
Program fragment:
```
if name == "":
    return "Empty String"
elif name == "John":
    return "Hello, John!"
else:
    return "Welcome"

```
Postcondition for if body: if `name` is an empty string, the function returns "Empty String"
Postcondition for else body: If `name` is "John", the function returns "Hello, John!". Otherwise, the function returns "Welcome".
Postcondition: **`name` is a string. If `name` is an empty string, the function returns "Empty String". If `name` is "John", the function returns "Hello, John!". Otherwise, the function returns "Welcome".**
