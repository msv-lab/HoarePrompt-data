Example Answer:
The values of w2, h2, w3, h3 are assigned from the next values in the iterator. The initial values of a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, possible_orientations are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, possible_orientations remain unchanged, w2, h2, w3, h3 are updated based on the next values from the iterator.
Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, possible_orientations remain unchanged, w2, h2, w3, h3 are updated based on the next values from the iterator**
