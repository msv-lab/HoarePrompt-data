Example Answer:
`remaining_bourles` is assigned the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`. The previous values of `r` and `min_buy_price` are positive integers. Since the division operation results in a remainder, `remaining_bourles` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s is a list of n positive integers inputted by the user, constrained between 1 and 1000. `b` is a list of m positive integers after input by the user. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`; `max_shares` is a positive integer; `remaining_bourles` is a positive integer.
