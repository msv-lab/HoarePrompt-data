Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the result of mapping integers to the input split by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; s is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; s is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000**
