According to the code, the loop will only execute if `i` is less than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 0. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
State: **`r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers, `i` is decremented by 1**
