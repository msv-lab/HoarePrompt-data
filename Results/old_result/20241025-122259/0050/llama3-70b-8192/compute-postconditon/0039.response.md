Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, where `b` is an array. If `shares` is not greater than 0, we break out of the loop. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers, `i` is decremented by 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated, `shares` becomes 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, then we break out of the loop.
Output State: **`r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers, `i` is decremented by 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated, `shares` becomes 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, then we break out of the loop**
