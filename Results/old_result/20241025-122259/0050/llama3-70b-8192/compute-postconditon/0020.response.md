Example Answer:
The value of `r` is modified by taking the modulo of `r` with the value of `s` at index `i`. The value of `i` is less than 0, so the value of `s[i]` might not be defined. Therefore, the output state is: `r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers, `i` is less than 0.
Output State: **`r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers, `i` is less than 0**
