According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is decremented by 1. Additionally, if `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` needs to be updated and `shares` needs to become 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, then we break out of the loop. 
State: **`r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers, `i` is decremented by 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated, `shares` becomes 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, then we break out of the loop**
