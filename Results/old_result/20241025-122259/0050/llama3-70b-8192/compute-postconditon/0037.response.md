Output State: `r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers, `i` is decremented by 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, `shares` becomes 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is decremented by 1.
