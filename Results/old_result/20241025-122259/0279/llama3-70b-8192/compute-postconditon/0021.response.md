A `StopIteration` exception may be raised when trying to get the next value from `iter_i` at `i = next(iter_i)`. If this exception occurs, the program should break out of the loop. After fully executing the `try` block, the program's state is as follows: `v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` and `d` have assigned values from the input splitting them; `max_speed` is between 1 and 100; `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `max_length` is between `t+1` and `100t+100`; `min_length` is between `t + min_speed` and `100t + min_speed`; `i` is assigned the next value from the iterator `iter_i`; `max_speed` is updated based on the calculation; `max_length` is increased by `max_speed`; `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` and `d` have assigned values from the input splitting them; `max_speed` is between 1 and 100; `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `max_length` is between `t+1` and `100t+100`; `min_length` is between `t + min_speed` and `100t + min_speed`; `i` is assigned the next value from the iterator `iter_i`; `max_speed` is updated based on the calculation; `max_length` is increased by `max_speed`; `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`.**
