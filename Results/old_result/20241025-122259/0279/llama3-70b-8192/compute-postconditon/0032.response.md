Example Answer: 
The loop runs until a `StopIteration` exception occurs. The `max_length` is printed, which is between `t+1` and `100t+100`. The other variables remain the same as the final iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` and `d` have assigned values from the input splitting them; `max_speed` is between 1 and 100; `min_speed` is between 1 and 100; `max_length` is between `t+1` and `100t+100`; `min_length` is between `t + min_speed` and `100t + min_speed`; `i` is assigned the value that caused the `StopIteration`.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` and `d` have assigned values from the input splitting them; `max_speed` is between 1 and 100; `min_speed` is between 1 and 100; `max_length` is between `t+1` and `100t+100`; `min_length` is between `t + min_speed` and `100t + min_speed`; `i` is assigned the value that caused the `StopIteration`**
