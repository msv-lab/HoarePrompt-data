Example Answer:
`speeds[0]` is assigned the value `v1`, where `v1` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements with the first element assigned as `v1`.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements with the first element assigned as `v1`**
