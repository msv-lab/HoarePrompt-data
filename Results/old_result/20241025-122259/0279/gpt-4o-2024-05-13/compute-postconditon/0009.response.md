Example Answer: 
The value at index i of `speeds` is updated based on the minimum between the previous value at index i and `d`, and `v2` plus the remaining time multiplied by `d`. The previous values of `speeds`, `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` are used in the calculation. After execution, the output state is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements with updated values.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements with updated values**
