Example Answer:
The last element of the list `speeds` is assigned the value of `v2`, where `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100. Therefore, after the execution, the output state is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements with the first element assigned as `v1` and the last element assigned as `v2`.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements with the first element assigned as `v1` and the last element assigned as `v2`**
