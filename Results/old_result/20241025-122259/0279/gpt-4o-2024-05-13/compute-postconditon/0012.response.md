Example Answer:
The value of `speeds[i]` is updated based on the previous element of `speeds` and the given formula. The new value of `speeds[i]` is calculated using the minimum between the sum of the previous element and `d` and the sum of `v2` and the difference between `t`, `i`, and 1 multiplied by `d`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `speeds`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements with updated values, and `i` is increased by 1, `i` is less than `t + 1.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements with updated values, and `i` is increased by 1, `i` is less than `t + 1**
