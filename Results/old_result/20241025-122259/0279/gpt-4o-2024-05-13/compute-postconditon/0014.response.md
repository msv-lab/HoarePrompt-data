According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and it is less than `t + 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements with updated values, and `i` is increased by 1, `i` is less than `t + 1**
