Example Answer: 
`remaining_kvass` is assigned the value of `s`, where `s` represents the glass volume. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume, `total_volume` is the sum of volumes in the list, `min_keg_volume` is the volume of the first keg in the list, and `remaining_kvass` is the glass volume.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume, `total_volume` is the sum of volumes in the list, `min_keg_volume` is the volume of the first keg in the list, and `remaining_kvass` is the glass volume**
