Example Answer:
`remaining_kvass` is decreased by the value of `possible_to_take`. The value of `possible_to_take` is the minimum value between (volumes[i] - min_keg_volume) and remaining_kvass. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume, `total_volume` is the sum of volumes in the list, `min_keg_volume` is the volume of the first keg in the list, `remaining_kvass` is the glass volume after subtracting possible_to_take, `i` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `possible_to_take` is the minimum value between (volumes[i] - min_keg_volume) and remaining_kvass**
