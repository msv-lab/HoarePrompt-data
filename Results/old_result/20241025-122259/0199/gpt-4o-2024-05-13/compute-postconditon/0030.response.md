Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `s`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` are integers.
Output State: **`n`, `s`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` are integers**
