Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the first integer from the input split and `s` is assigned the second integer from the input split. The input split function splits the input by spaces and converts them to integers. The output state is: `n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume**
