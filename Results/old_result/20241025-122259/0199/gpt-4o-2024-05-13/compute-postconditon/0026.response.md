Example Answer:
The value of `remaining_kvass` is decreased by the value of `possible_to_take`. Since all variables are integers, the subtraction operation will result in an integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `s`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, `i`, and `possible_to_take` are integers with the updated value of `remaining_kvass` after subtraction.
Output State: **`n`, `s`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, `i`, and `possible_to_take` are integers with the updated value of `remaining_kvass` after subtraction**
