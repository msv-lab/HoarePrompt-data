Example Answer: 
`n` and `s` are assigned values using `map(int, input().split())`, where input accepts input separated by spaces, map converts them to integers, and split splits the input. The values of `n` and `s` are within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `s` are integers within the specified ranges, and `v` is an empty list.**
Output State: **`n` and `s` are integers within the specified ranges, and `v` is an empty list.**
