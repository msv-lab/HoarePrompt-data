```
**Output**:
```
199
```
**Scenario**: Alice has the maximum number of books (100). The optimal division is to place the two largest books in different piles.

#### Test 8: All Books Have the Same Number of Pages
**Input**:
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Scenario**: Alice has five books with the same number of pages. The optimal division is to place two books in one pile and three in another, but the result will be the same regardless of the division.

#### Test 9: Books with Very Large Page Counts
**Input**:
```
1
3
1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
2000000000
```
**Scenario**: Alice has books with very large page counts. The optimal division is to place the two largest books in different piles.

#### Test 10: Books with Sequential Page Counts
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
9
```
**Scenario**: Alice has books with sequential page counts. The optimal division is to place the two largest books in different piles.

#### Test 11: Books with Repeated Largest Page Count
**Input**:
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Scenario**: Alice has four books with the same largest page count. The optimal division is to place two books in one pile and two in another.
