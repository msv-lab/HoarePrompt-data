Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Simple Increasing Sequence
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split could be `s = [2, 4, 5]` and `t = [1, 3]`. The penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 1 = 3`.

#### Test 2: Mixed Sequence
**Input**:
```
1
8
8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split could be `s = [8, 3, 1]` and `t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`. The penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 1 = 1`.

#### Test 3: All Elements Equal
**Input**:
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split could be `s = []` and `t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. The penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

#### Test 4: Single Element
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split could be `s = []` and `t = [1]`. The penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

#### Test 5: Two Elements
**Input**:
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split could be `s = [2]` and `t = [1]`. The penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6: Maximum Number of Test Cases
**Input**:
```
10000
1
1
1
1
...
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
0
0
0
...
0
0
```
**Explanation**: Each test case has a single element, so the penalty is always 0.

#### Test 7: Maximum Array Size
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
199999
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split could be `s = [2, 4, 6, ..., 200000]` and `t = [1, 3, 5, ..., 199999]`. The penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 99999 + 99999 = 199999`.

#### Test 8: All Elements Are the Same but Large
**Input**:
```
1
200000
100000 100000 100000 ... 100000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split could be `s = []` and `t = [100000, 100000, ..., 100000]`. The penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

#### Test 9: Alternating Sequence
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split could be `s = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and `t = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. The penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 4 = 4`.

#### Test 10: Randomly Shuffled Sequence
**Input**:
```
1
10
5 3 1 4 2 10 8 6 9 7
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split could be `s = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` and `t = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6]`. The penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 4 = 4`.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and handles various edge cases effectively.
