Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment by considering the following aspects:

1. **Floor and Block Calculation**: The program accurately computes the floor and block numbers for both apartments using modular arithmetic.
   - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1`: Computes the floor number for apartment `a`.
   - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`: Computes the block number for apartment `a`.
   - Similar computations are done for apartment `b`.

2. **Minimum Block Time**: 
   - `min_block_time` is computed as the minimum of the direct path time between blocks and the circular path time around the building.
   - This is correctly implemented with the formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.

3. **Minimum Floor Time**: 
   - If `a_floor > b_floor`, the time taken to go from one floor to another via the elevator and stairs is correctly computed as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` (10 seconds for the elevator ride).
   - If `b_floor > a_floor`, the same logic is applied but with the floors reversed.

4. **Output**: The total minimum time is the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

Given the provided logic and the problem statement, the program accurately calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment under the constraints and rules specified.

Correctness: **True**
