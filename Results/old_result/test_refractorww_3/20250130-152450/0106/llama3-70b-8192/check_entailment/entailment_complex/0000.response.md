Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the inputs \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(a\), and \(b\) from standard input. This part is correct and adheres to the problem statement.

2. **Floor and Block Calculation**: The calculations for determining the floor and block numbers are correct. The expressions `(a - 1) % m + 1` and `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` accurately compute the floor and block for apartment \(a\). Similarly, these expressions are used to compute the floor and block for apartment \(b\).

3. **Block Travel Time Calculation**: The calculation of the block travel time is correct. The minimum block travel time is determined as the minimum of the direct distance or the wrap-around distance between the blocks, each multiplied by 15 seconds. This logic correctly accounts for the circular nature of the building.

4. **Floor Travel Time Calculation**: The floor travel time is correctly calculated based on whether \(a\_floor\) is greater than \(b\_floor\). The expression `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` adds an additional 10 seconds for the lift wait time, which is necessary according to the problem statement.

5. **Total Time Calculation**: The total time is correctly computed as the sum of the minimum block travel time and the minimum floor travel time.

Given that all parts of the program adhere to the problem statement and correctly perform the required calculations, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
