Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment in all cases. Specifically, the calculation of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` is flawed.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Block Travel Time Calculation**:
   - The code calculates `min_block_time` using the formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. This formula assumes that the shortest path between two blocks is either the direct path or the wrap-around path, but it does not account for the possibility that one block might be directly adjacent to the other through the "wrap-around" nature of the building. For instance, if `a_block` is 1 and `b_block` is `n`, the actual shortest path could be 15 seconds (one way around the building) instead of `n * 15`.

2. **Floor Travel Time Calculation**:
   - The code calculates `min_floor_time` using a fixed 10-second overhead for the lift, followed by a linear travel time based on the difference in floor levels. However, this does not account for the possibility that the lift might be faster than walking, especially over small distances. The code assumes that the lift travel time is always 1 second per floor, which may not be accurate for all cases, particularly for small distances where walking might be faster.

### Example Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  4 10 5
  100 105
  ```

- Expected Output: 
  - Since 100 and 105 are on the same floor (10th floor), the fastest way would be to use the lift to go from the 100th apartment to the 105th apartment, which takes 5 seconds (1 second per floor).

- Actual Output: 
  - The code calculates the block travel time as 0 (since they are in the same block) and the floor travel time as `15 + 10 = 25` seconds (assuming the lift is used, which is not necessarily the fastest option).

In this case, the actual minimum time should be 5 seconds (using the lift), but the code incorrectly calculates it as 25 seconds.

### Conclusion:
The provided code fails to handle the optimal use of the lift and does not correctly calculate the shortest path in certain scenarios. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
