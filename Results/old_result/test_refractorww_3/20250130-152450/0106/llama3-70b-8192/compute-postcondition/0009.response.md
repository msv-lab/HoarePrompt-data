Output State: **`a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1` and is greater than `b_floor`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, or the difference between `n` and the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, `min_floor_time` is `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`**

The code calculates `min_floor_time` as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given the initial conditions, `a_floor` and `b_floor` remain unchanged, and `a_block` and `b_block` also remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. The `min_block_time` remains as previously calculated. The only new value calculated is `min_floor_time`, which is the expression `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`.
