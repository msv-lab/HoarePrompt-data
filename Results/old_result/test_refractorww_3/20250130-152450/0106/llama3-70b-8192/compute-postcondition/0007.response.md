Postcondition: `a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, or the difference between `n` and the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15. The current value of `a_floor` is greater than the current value of `b_floor`.
