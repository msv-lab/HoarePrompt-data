Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial conditions**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This changes the values of `a` and `b` to the integers entered by the user. However, the initial conditions for `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the code snippet.
