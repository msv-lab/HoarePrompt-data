Output State: **`a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, or the difference between `n` and the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15.**

This output state reflects that the values of `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` remain unchanged. The new variable `min_block_time` is introduced and calculated based on the given formula.
