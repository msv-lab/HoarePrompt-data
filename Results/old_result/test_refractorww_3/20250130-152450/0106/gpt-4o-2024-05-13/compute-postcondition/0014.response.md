Output State: **The program returns total_time which is calculated as 10 plus floor_a minus 1 plus the minimum of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time plus 5 times (floor_b - 1)**.

To break it down further:
- `time_to_exit` is given as `10 + floor_a - 1`.
- `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
  - `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
  - `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
- `time_to_target_floor` is `5 * (floor_b - 1)`.

Therefore, `total_time` combines these components. The program returns the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.
