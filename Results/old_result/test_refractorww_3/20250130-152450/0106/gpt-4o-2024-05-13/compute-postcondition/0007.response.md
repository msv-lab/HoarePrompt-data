Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 with `a` not equal to `b`, `block_a` and `floor_a` are the values returned by the function `get_location(a)`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are the values returned by the function `get_location(b)`, and `floor_a` is not equal to 1; `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1.**

In natural language, this means that `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` retain their initial values and conditions. The new variable `time_to_exit` is calculated as `10 + (floor_a - 1)`.
