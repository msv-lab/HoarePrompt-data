Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `apartment`, which represents the apartment number within a specified range. It returns a tuple containing two elements: the first element is the block number, calculated as `((apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1)`, and the second element is the floor number, calculated as `((apartment - 1) % (m * k) // k + 1)`.**
