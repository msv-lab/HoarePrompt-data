Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. These parameters are positive integers where \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \times m \times k\) with the condition that \(a \neq b\). The function calculates and returns `total_time`, which represents the total time required for a person to exit a building, walk to another block, and reach the target floor. 

The process involves determining the location of blocks `a` and `b` within the building (split into `block` and `floor` components), calculating the time to exit the building if the person is not on the first floor, determining the shortest path between the two blocks, and calculating the time to reach the target floor (`floor_b`). The final `total_time` is the sum of these individual times.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function correctly handles the case when `floor_a` is 1, setting `time_to_exit` to 0.
2. The function correctly calculates `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` based on the absolute difference between the blocks and the number of columns `n`.
3. The function accurately determines the minimum walking time between the two paths.
4. The function calculates `time_to_target_floor` as 5 times the number of floors the person needs to travel to reach their target floor.

There are no explicit missing functionalities noted in the provided code. However, the function assumes that the building has a consistent layout and that the input values are valid according to the given constraints.**
