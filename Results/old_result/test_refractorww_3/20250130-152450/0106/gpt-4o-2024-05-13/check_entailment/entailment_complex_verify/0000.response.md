Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. The original assessment is accurate because:

1. **Function `get_location`**: This function correctly calculates the block and floor for a given apartment number, ensuring that the location is determined accurately.
2. **Main Function `func_1`**: 
   - It first retrieves the block and floor for both apartments.
   - It then calculates the time to exit the current apartment if needed, considering the elevator wait and travel time.
   - It calculates the minimum time to walk around the building to the target block, either directly or by going the other way.
   - It adds the time required to walk to the target floor using the stairs.
   - Finally, it returns the total time, which is computed correctly based on the given logic.

The annotated version confirms that the program handles all the necessary cases correctly, as demonstrated by the provided examples. There are no issues or edge cases identified in the annotated version that would lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
