Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided problem description and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. 

1. **Function `get_location`**: The function accurately calculates the block and floor for a given apartment number. It handles the case where the apartment number is within the valid range \([1, n \cdot m \cdot k]\). Although the function does not explicitly handle invalid input for the apartment number, the original problem statement guarantees that the input will be valid. Therefore, this does not affect the overall correctness of the program.

2. **Main Function `func_1`**: The main function correctly calculates the time to exit the current apartment using the elevator, the time to walk around the building to the target block, and the time to walk to the target floor using the stairs. The logic for determining the minimum time to walk around the building is sound, and the time calculations are accurate based on the problem description.

Given that the program handles all the scenarios described in the problem statement and examples correctly, and considering the valid input assumption, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
