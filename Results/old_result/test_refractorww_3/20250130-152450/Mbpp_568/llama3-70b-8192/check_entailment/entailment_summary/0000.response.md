Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries for any non-negative integer `n`. The list comprehension `[{} for _ in range(n)]` ensures that the function returns a list containing `n` empty dictionaries. Since the function works correctly for any non-negative integer input and there are no edge cases mentioned, the program is correct according to the problem description.
