Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a list containing `n` empty dictionaries, which is exactly what the problem description requires. The annotation provided also correctly describes the state of the program, confirming that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
