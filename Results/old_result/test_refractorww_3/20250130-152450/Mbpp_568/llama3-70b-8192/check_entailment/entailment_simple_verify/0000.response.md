Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries, which aligns with the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, generating a list of empty dictionaries based on the input `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. There are no edge cases or invalid inputs considered in the annotation, and the function handles valid inputs correctly. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
