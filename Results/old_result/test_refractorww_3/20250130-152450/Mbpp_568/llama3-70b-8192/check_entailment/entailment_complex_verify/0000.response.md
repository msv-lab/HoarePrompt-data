Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` meets the problem description of creating a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The annotated version confirms that the function works correctly for any non-negative integer input `n`. The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of `n` empty dictionaries, which aligns with the problem requirements. Since the annotated version supports the correctness and there are no edge cases mentioned that the function fails to handle, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
