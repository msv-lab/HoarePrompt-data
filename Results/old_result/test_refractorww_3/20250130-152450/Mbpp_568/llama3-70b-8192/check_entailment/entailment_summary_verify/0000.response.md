Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the program's functionality. The function `func_1` correctly generates a list of `n` empty dictionaries for any non-negative integer `n`. The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, handling any valid non-negative integer input without any edge cases that would render it incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
