Reasoning: 
The provided function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as an argument and returns a list containing `n` empty dictionaries. This behavior aligns with the problem description which asks for a function to create a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of empty dictionaries, which is a correct and efficient approach.

Given that the function handles non-negative integers as expected and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause it to fail (such as very large values of `n`), and considering the function's implementation matches the requirements exactly, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
