Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to create a list of N empty dictionaries.

# Program:
assert func_1(5) == [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
assert func_1(6) == [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
assert func_1(7) == [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}]

def func_1(N):
    return [{} for _ in range(N)]



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
