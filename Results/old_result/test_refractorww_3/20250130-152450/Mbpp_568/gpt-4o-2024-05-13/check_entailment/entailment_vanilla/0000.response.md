### Reasoning:
- The problem requires a function that takes an integer `N` and returns a list of `N` empty dictionaries.
- The provided test cases check if the function `func_1` correctly returns a list of `N` empty dictionaries for `N = 5`, `N = 6`, and `N = 7`.
- The implementation of `func_1` uses a list comprehension to create a list of `N` empty dictionaries.
- The list comprehension `[{} for _ in range(N)]` creates a new dictionary `{}` for each iteration in the range from `0` to `N-1`, resulting in a list of `N` empty dictionaries.

Since the provided implementation matches the requirements and the test cases pass, the function is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
