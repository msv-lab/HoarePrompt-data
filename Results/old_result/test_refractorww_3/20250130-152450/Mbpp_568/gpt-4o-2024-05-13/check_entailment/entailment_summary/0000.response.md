Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list containing exactly `N` empty dictionaries. The list comprehension `[{} for _ in range(N)]` correctly generates a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The provided assertions cover different values of `N` (5, 6, and 7), and the function behaves as expected in these cases. Since the code handles the required functionality correctly for the given problem description and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints, the program is correct.
