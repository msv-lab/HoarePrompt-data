Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The annotations confirm that the function accepts a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list containing exactly `N` empty dictionaries. Since the provided test cases pass and the annotated version supports the correctness of the function, the original assessment is valid.
