Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list containing exactly `N` empty dictionaries. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given inputs (5, 6, and 7). Since the function meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the annotations that would indicate the function is incorrect.
