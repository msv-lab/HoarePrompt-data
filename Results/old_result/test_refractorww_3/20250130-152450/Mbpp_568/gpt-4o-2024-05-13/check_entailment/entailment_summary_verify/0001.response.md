Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to create a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a non-negative integer `N` and returning a list containing exactly `N` empty dictionaries. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints that would contradict the original assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of the program's correctness as True is appropriate.
