Reasoning: 
The provided function `func_1` correctly generates a list containing `N` empty dictionaries based on the input parameter `N`. The annotated comments and the assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for different values of `N`. Specifically, the function uses a list comprehension to create a list of `N` empty dictionaries, which matches the problem statement and the provided assertions.

Correctness: **True**
