Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to take an integer `N` as input and return a list containing `N` empty dictionaries. The provided code correctly implements this behavior using a list comprehension that generates `N` empty dictionaries. Each dictionary within the list is independent and empty, which matches the assertions provided.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The function `func_1` takes an argument `N`.
2. It returns a list comprehension that generates a list of `N` empty dictionaries.
3. The list comprehension `[{} for _ in range(N)]` correctly creates `N` empty dictionaries, each distinct from the others.

Given the provided assertions, the function works as expected:
- `func_1(5)` returns a list with 5 empty dictionaries.
- `func_1(6)` returns a list with 6 empty dictionaries.
- `func_1(7)` returns a list with 7 empty dictionaries.

Since the function implementation matches the problem description and the provided test cases, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
