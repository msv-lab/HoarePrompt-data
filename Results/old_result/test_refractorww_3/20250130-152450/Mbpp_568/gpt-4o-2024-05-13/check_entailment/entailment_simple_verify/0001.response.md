Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes an integer `N` and returns a list of `N` empty dictionaries, which matches the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, creating a list of empty dictionaries based on the input `N`. Since the test cases provided also confirm the correctness of the function, the original assessment is correct.
