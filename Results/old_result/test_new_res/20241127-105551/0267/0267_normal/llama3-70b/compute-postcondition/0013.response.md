`dp[n, k]` is updated to `9`, `k` must be greater than `2`, and `i` is `2`. The calculation involves updating `dp[n, k]` as follows:

1. `dp[n, k]` is currently `9`.
2. Calculate the term `10 ** (i - 1)`, which is `10 ** (2 - 1)` or `10 ** 1`, resulting in `10`.
3. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`, which is `10 ** (k - 2)`.
4. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)` again, which is `10`.
5. The expression `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** (k - 2) - 10`.
6. Now, multiply `9` by `10` and by the expression from step 5: `9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`.

The final value assigned to `dp[n, k]` will be:

```
dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)
```

At this point, `k` is unspecified but must be greater than `2`. The specific impact on `dp[n, k]` cannot be calculated without knowing `k`, but we can represent the expression.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 + 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`, `k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**.
