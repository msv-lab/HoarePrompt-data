The operation `dp[n, k] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[n, k]` by taking the remainder of `dp[n, k]` when divided by `MOD`. The variable `dp[n, k]` is affected, while `MOD` is a constant. Since the previous value of `dp[n, k]` is unknown, we can only state that it has been reduced based on the modulus operation. 

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated based on the value of `MOD`**
