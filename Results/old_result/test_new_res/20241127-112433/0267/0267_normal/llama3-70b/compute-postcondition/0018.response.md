The variable `dp[n, k]` is assigned to itself modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` is increased by the sum of the calculations involving `(10`, which is not included in the current state, but it will not affect the output state since we are only considering the current line of code. The modulo operation will ensure that `dp[n, k]` remains within the bounds set by `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is modified to `dp[n, k] % MOD`**
