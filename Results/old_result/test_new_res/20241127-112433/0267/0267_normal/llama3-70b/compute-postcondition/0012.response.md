According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which is incremented with each iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `k` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to be able to execute again.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10; `i` is 2; `dp[n, k]` is increased by `9 * 10`**
