To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to carefully analyze both the problem statement and the implementation of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description
The task is to count the occurrences of specific elements from a list in a tuple.

### Program Implementation
The function `func_1` is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

This function takes two parameters:
- `tup`: a tuple in which we need to count the occurrences of specified elements.
- `elements`: a list of elements whose occurrences we are to count in the tuple.

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `elements`, counts how many times each element appears in `tup` using the `count` method, and sums these counts to get the total.

### Test Cases
The provided assertions are tests to verify the function's correctness:

1. `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])` should return `3` (2 occurrences of 'a' + 1 occurrence of 'b').
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7])` should return `6` (3 occurrences of 1 + 2 occurrences of 4 + 1 occurrence of 7).
3. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2])` should return `2` (1 occurrence of 1 + 1 occurrence of 2).

### Analysis of Possible Edge Cases
Now, we need to consider if there are any potential edge cases or situations that the function might not handle correctly:

1. **Empty Tuple**: If the tuple is empty and we provide any elements in the list, the count should return `0`, which is handled correctly by the function.
   
   Example: `func_1((), ['a', 'b'])` returns `0`, which is correct.

2. **Empty List**: If the list of elements is empty, the function should return `0`, which is also handled correctly.

   Example: `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), [])` returns `0`, which is correct.

3. **Non-existent Elements**: If elements that do not exist in the tuple are given, the function should still return the correct count.

   Example: `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), ['x', 'y'])` returns `0`, which is correct.

4. **Non-hashable Types**: The function assumes that the elements in the list are hashable (which they should be in the context of typical usage with tuples and lists).

5. **Same Elements Multiple Times**: It handles duplicate elements in the list correctly (as seen in the test cases).

After considering all possible edge cases, the function appears to handle them appropriately.

### Conclusion
Since we cannot find any cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, we conclude that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
