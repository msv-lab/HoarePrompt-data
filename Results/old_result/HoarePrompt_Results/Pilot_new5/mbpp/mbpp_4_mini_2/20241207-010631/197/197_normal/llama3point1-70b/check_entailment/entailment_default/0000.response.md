To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1`, let's analyze it according to the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to count the occurrences of all elements in a list (`lst`) in a tuple (`tup`). 

### Function Code:
```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))
```

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: The function uses a generator expression to count the occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`. The method `tup.count(element)` returns the count of `element` in `tup` correctly.
  
2. **Handling Elements**: The function sums the counts, which means if an element from `lst` is not found in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` will return `0`, and this is correctly handled by the `sum()` function.

3. **Empty Inputs**: The function will correctly return `0` if `lst` is empty, as there are no elements to count, which aligns with the description.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that:
- The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`.
- It returns the total count of how many times each element in `lst` appears in `tup`.
- It mentions handling cases where elements from `lst` may not be present in `tup` (counting as `0`).
- It notes that the function does not explicitly handle empty inputs but will return `0` when `lst` is empty.

### Edge Cases:
Both the code and the output hints seem to handle the following cases correctly:
- If `lst` is empty, the function will return `0`.
- If `lst` contains elements not present in `tup`, the count for those elements will be `0`, which is correctly managed.

### Conclusion:
Since the function correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description and the output hints agree with this implementation, there are no identified edge cases that the function fails to address.

Correctness: **True**. 

### Explanation:
The code accurately counts occurrences of elements in `lst` within the tuple `tup`, handles empty lists correctly, and sums counts properly according to the specifications provided in the problem description and output hints.
