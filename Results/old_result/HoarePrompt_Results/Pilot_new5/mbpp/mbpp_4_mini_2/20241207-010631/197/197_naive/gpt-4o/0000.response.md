To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the function `func_1()` within the context of the provided problem description, which is to count the occurrences of all elements from a list in a tuple.

Here's the provided implementation:

```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

### Analysis

1. **Functionality**: 
   - The function iterates over each element in the `elements` list.
   - For each element, it counts how many times that element appears in the `tup` tuple using `tup.count(element)`.
   - It sums up these counts and returns the total.

2. **Test Cases**: 
   - The provided assertions are:
     - `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])` should return `3` (2 occurrences of 'a' + 1 occurrence of 'b').
     - `func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7])` should return `6` (3 occurrences of 1 + 2 occurrences of 4 + 1 occurrence of 7).
     - `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2])` should return `2` (1 occurrence of 1 + 1 occurrence of 2).

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `elements` contains an item not in `tup`, it should not affect the count, which the current implementation handles correctly.
   - If `elements` is empty, the function should return `0` since there are no elements to count.
   - If `tup` is empty, the function should also return `0` since there are no occurrences to count, regardless of the contents of `elements`.

### Testing Edge Cases

- **Case 1 (Empty elements list)**:
    ```python
    assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), []) == 0
    ```

- **Case 2 (Empty tuple)**:
    ```python
    assert func_1((), ['a', 'b']) == 0
    ```

Both of these edge cases are indeed handled by the current implementation:
- When `elements` is empty, the generator expression results in zero iterations, and thus the sum is zero.
- When `tup` is empty, `tup.count(element)` will return `0` for each element in `elements`, and thus the sum remains zero.

### Conclusion

Considering all the provided assertions and potential edge cases, the implementation correctly counts the occurrences of the elements in the tuple. There are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
