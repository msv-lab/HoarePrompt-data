Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here’s the breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters: `tup` (which is a tuple) and `elements` (which is a list). This aligns with the problem’s requirement to count occurrences of elements from a list in a tuple.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The statement `tup.count(element)` is used within a generator expression to count how many times each element from the list appears in the tuple. The `sum()` function then aggregates these counts to provide the total count of occurrences. This effectively fulfills the requirement of counting how many times all elements from the list appear in the tuple.

3. **Correctness of Example Assertions**: The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases to validate the function's behavior. Each assertion checks if the function returns the expected count of occurrences, which confirms that the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem.

4. **General Case Handling**: The implementation correctly handles various types of inputs, including multiple occurrences of the same element, different data types, and the possibility of elements not being present in the tuple.

Since the implementation accurately reflects the problem description and effectively counts the occurrences of specified elements in the given tuple, it is deemed correct.
