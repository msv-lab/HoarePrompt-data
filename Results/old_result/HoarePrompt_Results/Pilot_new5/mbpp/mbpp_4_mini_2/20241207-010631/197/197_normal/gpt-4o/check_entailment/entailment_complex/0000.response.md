Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and it counts how many times each element in `elements` appears in `tup`. This is done using a generator expression that sums the counts of each element found in the tuple, leveraging the `count` method of tuples. 

The function also handles the case when the `elements` list is empty by returning 0, which is acceptable under the problem description since there are no elements to count.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for various test cases, confirming that it meets the requirements as stated. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.
