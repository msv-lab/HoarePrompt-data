The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can have elements of any type. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists` (denoted as `max_len`) and the first sublist from `max_sublists`, which contains sublists of that maximum length. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return the maximum length of the sublists along with the first sublist that has this maximum length. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns the maximum length of the sublists and the first sublist with that maximum length.**
