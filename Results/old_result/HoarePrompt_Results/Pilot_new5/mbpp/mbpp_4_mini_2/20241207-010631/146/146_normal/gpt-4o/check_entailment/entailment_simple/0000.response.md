Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find the longest sublist in a list of lists, which is aligned with the problem description. However, the expected output format, as indicated by the assertions, requires that the function returns a tuple containing the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself.

The assertions used in the test cases are incorrect because they inaccurately represent the expected results. For instance:

- The first assertion `assert func_1([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == (3, [13, 15, 17])` is incorrect because the length of the longest sublist `[13, 15, 17]` is indeed 3, but the function should return `(3, [13, 15, 17])`. The assertion is correct in that regard, but it has no assertion to check the case when the input is an empty list.

- If the input list is empty, `func_1` will return `(0, [])`, which is the correct behavior according to the code logic, but the example cases provided do not include this edge case. The program's behavior is not tested for the case of an empty input list, which is a significant oversight.

Furthermore, there is no assertion to check for cases where there are multiple sublists of maximum length, which the problem description does not specify how to handle.

Thus, the program is not validated against all edge cases, and it may not function correctly in all scenarios. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct based on the problem description.
