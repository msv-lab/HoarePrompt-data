To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and how it behaves according to the problem description, which is to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The function initializes `max_len` to `0` and `max_list` to an empty list.
2. It iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`.
3. For each list, if its length is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and sets `max_list` to the current list.
4. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

**Test Cases:**
The assertions provided are:
- `assert func_1([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == (3, [13, 15, 17])`
- `assert func_1([[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]) == (4, [10, 12, 14, 15])`
- `assert func_1([[5], [15, 20, 25]]) == (3, [15, 20, 25])`

These tests check for lists of varying lengths, and according to the logic, they seem correct.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. What if the list of lists is empty? The function would return `(0, [])`, which still seems reasonable since there are no lists to compare.
2. What if all lists are of the same maximum length? For example, if we call `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])`, it will return `(2, [5, 6])`, which is correct but only returns the last occurrence of the maximum length list. This behavior is not explicitly stated in the problem description but is an implicit requirement that could be misinterpreted.
3. If there are lists with `None` values or mixed types (e.g., `func_1([[1], [None], [2, 3]])`), the function would still process lengths based on object counts.

**Conclusion:**
The function appears to handle the initial assertions correctly, but there is ambiguity in the expected behavior when there are multiple lists of the maximum length. It will always return the last list it encounters of that maximum length, which might not be what the problem's description implies (if it requires returning all such lists). 

Thus, the function does not explicitly handle the edge case of duplicate maximum lengths appropriately, leading to a potential misinterpretation of requirements.

Correctness: **False**
