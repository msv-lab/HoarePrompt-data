The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of the maximum length among the sublists contained within `list_of_lists`. The variable `list_of_lists` remains unchanged, and the output state reflects the prior state of `list_of_lists` along with the newly computed value of `max_len`. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can contain elements of any type; `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`.**
