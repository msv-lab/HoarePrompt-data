The code assigns the length of the current list `lst` to `max_len`. Given that the length of `lst` is greater than the current value of `max_len` (which is 0), `max_len` will now hold a positive integer value reflecting the length of `lst`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must not be empty, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is an empty list.**
