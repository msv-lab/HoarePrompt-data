The `max_list` variable is assigned the value of `lst`. The state of `max_len` remains unchanged, and since `list_of_lists` must have at least 2 lists, it is not affected either. The previous value of `max_list` is not known, but it now holds the value of `lst`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` must have at least 2 lists, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `max_list` is now equal to `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least 2 lists, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
