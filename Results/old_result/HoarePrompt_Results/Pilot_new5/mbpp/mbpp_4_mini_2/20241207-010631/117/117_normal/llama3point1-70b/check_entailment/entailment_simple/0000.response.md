Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst)` is designed to take a single argument `lst`, which is expected to be a list.

2. **Integer Element Count**: Inside the function, the expression `isinstance(x, int)` checks if each element `x` in the list `lst` is an instance of an integer. This is crucial because the problem specifically asks for counting integer elements.

3. **Summation of Boolean Values**: The function uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function. In Python, `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0`. Therefore, summing the results of the `isinstance` checks effectively counts the number of integer elements in the list.

4. **Return Value**: The final output of the function is the total count of integer elements, which directly aligns with the requirement of returning the number of integer elements in the given list.

Overall, the function is robust and will return the correct count for lists containing various types of elements, including integers, floats, strings, and other data types. Thus, it adheres to the problem description accurately.
