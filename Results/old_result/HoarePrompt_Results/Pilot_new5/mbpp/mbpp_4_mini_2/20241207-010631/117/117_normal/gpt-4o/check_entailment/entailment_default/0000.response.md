To assess the correctness of the Python function `func_1`, we need to verify that it adheres to the problem description which states that the function should return the number of integer elements in a given list.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function `func_1` is defined to take a list `lst` and uses a generator expression to count the number of elements that are instances of `int`.
2. It specifically checks for integers using `isinstance(x, int)`, which correctly identifies integer types, ignoring floats, strings, and other data types.
3. It correctly sums up the count of integer instances.

### Edge Cases:
- An empty list should return `0`, as there are no integers to count. The code appears to handle this correctly since the sum of an empty generator will be `0`.
- If the list contains only non-integer types (e.g., strings, floats, None), it should also return `0`, which the code handles correctly.
- The function does not account for other numerical types such as `numpy.int64` or custom integer-like classes which may be relevant depending on the context.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints note:
- The function accepts a list and returns the count of integer elements within that list.
- It ignores all other data types.
- If the list is empty, it returns `0`.

The output hints are consistent with what the code is doing:
- The function indeed counts integer elements and returns `0` for an empty list or lists containing no integers.

### Final Conclusion:
The code seems to correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for all observed cases. However, there is a slight ambiguity regarding types that are not explicitly `int`, which might be permissible depending on the context but are not handled by the function.

Nonetheless, since no specific requirements were provided about these alternative representations of integers in the problem description, and given that the function behaves as expected for the examples provided, we can conclude that there is no case where the function fails based on the given description and examples.

Thus, based on the provided analysis:

Correctness: **True**.
