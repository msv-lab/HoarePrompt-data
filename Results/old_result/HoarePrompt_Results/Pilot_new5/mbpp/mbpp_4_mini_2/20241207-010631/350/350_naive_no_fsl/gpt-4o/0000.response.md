Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The assertions in the program cover several test cases, including:

1. The element is present and occurs at the beginning of the array.
2. The element occurs multiple times, and we want the last occurrence.
3. The element occurs, and we need to find its last index.

The logic in the function iterates through the array from the last index to the first, ensuring that the first match found is indeed the last occurrence. If the element is not found, it correctly returns -1. 

After analyzing, I can confirm that the function handles all edge cases defined by the problem description appropriately, such as:

- The element not being present in the array.
- The element being the only element in a single-element array.
- All elements in the array being the same as `x`.

No examples can be found where the function does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is established as true.
