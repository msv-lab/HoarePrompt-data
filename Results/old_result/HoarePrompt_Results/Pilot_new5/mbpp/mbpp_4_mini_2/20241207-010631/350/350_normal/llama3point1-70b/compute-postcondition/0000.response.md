According to the code, the for loop is designed to iterate over the indices of the `arr` list in reverse order, starting from the last index down to 0. The execution of this loop depends on the `arr` list having at least one element. 

If `arr` is empty, `len(arr)` would be 0, and the range would be `range(-1, -1, -1)`, which means the loop would not execute at all. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one integer.

At the end of the last iteration (if `arr` has elements), `i` would be the last index of the array in the first iteration, and `target` remains unchanged.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the last index of the `arr` list (len(arr) - 1)**
