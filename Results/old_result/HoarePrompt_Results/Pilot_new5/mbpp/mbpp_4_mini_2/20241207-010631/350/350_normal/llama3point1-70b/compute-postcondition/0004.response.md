According to the code, the loop is executed while iterating backwards over the indices of the `arr` list, which has at least 1 element. The loop starts with `i` at the last index of the `arr` list (which is `len(arr) - 1`) and decrements `i` in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its last index, which is `len(arr) - 1`, and the last element of `arr` at this index is not equal to `target`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `len(arr) - 2`. Additionally, the loop can continue as long as `i` remains greater than or equal to 0. Since `arr` has at least 1 element, `i` being decremented to `len(arr) - 2` implies that `arr` must still have at least 1 element, and thus the array state remains valid.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that has at least 1 element, `i` is the last index of the `arr` list (len(arr) - 2), and the last element of `arr` at index `i` is not equal to `target`.**
