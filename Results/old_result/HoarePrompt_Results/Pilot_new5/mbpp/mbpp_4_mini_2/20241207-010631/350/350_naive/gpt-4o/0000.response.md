Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, checking if each element matches the specified value `x`. If a match is found, it returns the index of that element. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns -1.

The assertions provided also cover various scenarios:
1. The first assertion tests the case where the element is the first in the list.
2. The second assertion tests a case where the element appears multiple times, ensuring that the last occurrence is returned.
3. The third assertion checks for an element that appears in the middle of the array.

All examples provided in the assertions work as intended, and no edge cases are missed. Thus, the program is correct.
