According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the length of the `arr`. The loop will execute if the length of `arr` is greater than 0, as it iterates from the last index to the first index of the list. 

At the start of the loop, the value of `i` should be initialized to the last index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`. If `arr` is empty, `len(arr)` would be 0 and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 integer and `i` should be set to `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
