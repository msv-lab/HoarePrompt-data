Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order containing at least 2 integers. If `arr[i]` is equal to `x`, the function returns the value of `i`, which is equal to the length of `arr` minus 3. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `x`, there is no return value from the function.***
