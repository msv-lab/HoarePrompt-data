Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to add the given tuple to the given list. Let's break down how the program achieves this:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst, tpl)` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `tpl`, which is a tuple.

2. **Concatenation**: Inside the function, the expression `lst + list(tpl)` is used. This converts the tuple `tpl` into a list using `list(tpl)` and then concatenates it with the original list `lst`. 

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the concatenated result, which is a new list containing the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tpl`.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code test various scenarios to ensure that the function behaves as expected. Each assertion checks that the output of the function matches the expected result when the function is called with specific arguments.

Since the function always concatenates the list and the tuple correctly and passes the assertions provided, it fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description. Thus, the program meets the criteria for correctness.
