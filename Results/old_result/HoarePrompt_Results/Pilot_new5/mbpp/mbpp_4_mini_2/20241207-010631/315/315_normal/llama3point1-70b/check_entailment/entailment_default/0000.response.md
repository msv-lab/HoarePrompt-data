To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the function according to the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that adds a given tuple to a given list. The expected behavior is that the function should concatenate the list and the tuple's elements (converted to a list) and return the result.

### Program Code
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
```

### Initial Assessment
1. **Basic Functionality**: The program takes a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`), converts the tuple to a list, and concatenates it with the original list. 
2. **Empty Inputs**: If `input_list` is empty and `input_tuple` contains elements, the function should return a list containing only those elements from the tuple. Conversely, if `input_tuple` is empty and `input_list` has elements, it should return the original list.
3. **Both Empty**: If both inputs are empty, it should return an empty list.

### Edge Cases
- If `input_list` is empty and `input_tuple` is empty, the output should be `[]`.
- If `input_list` is empty and `input_tuple` has elements, the output should be just the elements of the tuple.
- If `input_list` has elements and `input_tuple` is empty, the output should remain as `input_list`.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints state: 
- The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, and returns a new list created by concatenating `input_list` with the elements of `input_tuple` converted into a list.
- It mentions that the function handles empty inputs correctly, ensuring that if either input is empty, it still returns the correct non-empty input.

### Conclusion
The function indeed behaves as described in the problem statement and the output hints. It handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases with empty inputs.

Therefore, I find that the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description across all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
