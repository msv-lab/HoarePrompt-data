The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, and returns a new list that is created by concatenating `input_list` with the elements of `input_tuple` converted into a list. The function handles the conversion of the tuple to a list seamlessly and does not raise any errors for empty inputs. If either input is empty, the function still correctly returns a new list containing the non-empty input.
