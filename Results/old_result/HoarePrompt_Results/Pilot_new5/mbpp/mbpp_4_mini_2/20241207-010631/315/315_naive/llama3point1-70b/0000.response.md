Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list and a tuple as input and successfully adds the elements of the tuple to the list by first converting the tuple into a list and then concatenating the two lists. 

The function does not have edge cases where it would fail based on the problem description. For example:
- If `input_list` is empty and `input_tuple` is non-empty, the result will be the elements of the tuple.
- If `input_list` is non-empty and `input_tuple` is empty, the result will remain the same as `input_list`.
- If both are empty, the result will also correctly return an empty list.

In all scenarios, the program functions as intended according to the problem description.
