Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the result of concatenating `lst` with the elements of `tpl` converted to a list.

Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Concatenation**: The function uses the expression `lst + list(tpl)` to concatenate the list `lst` with the tuple `tpl` converted into a list. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

2. **Correctness of Test Cases**: The provided assertions in the annotated program check that the function behaves as expected for various inputs:
   - For `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))`, the result is `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`, which is correct.
   - For `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))`, the result is `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`, which is also correct.
   - For `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))`, the result is `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`, confirming that the function works appropriately.

3. **Assumption on Input Types**: While the comment notes that the function does not handle edge cases related to the types of elements in the list or tuple, the problem description does not specify any constraints regarding the types of elements. Therefore, we can assume that the function will be used with compatible types for concatenation.

In conclusion, the program consistently produces the correct output as required by the problem description, and thus it is verified as correct.
