#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list, and input_tuple is a tuple.
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
    #The program returns a new list that combines input_list and the elements of input_tuple converted into a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, and returns a new list that is created by concatenating `input_list` with the elements of `input_tuple` converted into a list. The function handles the conversion of the tuple to a list seamlessly and does not raise any errors for empty inputs. If either input is empty, the function still correctly returns a new list containing the non-empty input.
