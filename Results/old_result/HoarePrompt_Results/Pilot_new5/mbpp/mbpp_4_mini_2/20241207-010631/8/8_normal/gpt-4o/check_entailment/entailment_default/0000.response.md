To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, I will analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. If the character is not found or if it occurs only once, the function should return the original string.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found or if the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s` are the same. If `ch` occurs multiple times in `s`, it returns `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed while preserving the characters in between.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the character using `find()` and `rfind()`.
2. The conditions check if the character is not found or if the first and last indices are the same. In both cases, it returns the original string, which aligns with the problem description.
3. If `ch` occurs multiple times, the code constructs a new string by excluding the first and last occurrences, which seems to be implemented correctly.

### Edge Cases:
- If `ch` is not present in `s`, the function should return `s`, which is handled correctly.
- If `ch` only appears once, it should also return `s`, which is also correctly handled.
- If `ch` occurs multiple times, the function should remove the first and last occurrence correctly, which the code attempts to do.
  
However, there is a potential edge case that may lead to incorrect output:
- If the character `ch` appears consecutively at the start and end of the string, the code may produce an unexpected string. For example:
  - Input: `func_1('aaa', 'a')` should return an empty string, but the code would return an empty string only for the middle portion, resulting in something incorrect.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints are consistent with the code logic. They outline the expected behavior, which the code implements in normal cases. 

### Conclusion:
While the program appears to handle most cases as per the problem description, it does not correctly address the edge case when the character appears consecutively throughout the string. Thus, it fails in that scenario.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case where the character is the same throughout the string properly, leading to incorrect outputs for such inputs (e.g., `func_1('aaa', 'a')`).
