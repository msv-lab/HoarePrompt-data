The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found or if the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s` are the same. If `ch` occurs multiple times in `s`, it returns `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed while preserving the characters in between.
