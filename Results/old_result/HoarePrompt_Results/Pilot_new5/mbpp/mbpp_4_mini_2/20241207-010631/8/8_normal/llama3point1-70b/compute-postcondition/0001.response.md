`last_occurrence` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(char)`, which returns the highest index in `s` where the substring `char` is found. If `char` does not occur in `s`, `last_occurrence` will be -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found.**
