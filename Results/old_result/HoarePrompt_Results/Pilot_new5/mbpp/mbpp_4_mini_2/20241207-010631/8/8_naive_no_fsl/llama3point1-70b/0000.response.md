To determine the correctness of the provided Python function, we need to analyze how it behaves with various inputs based on the problem description, which states that we need to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Finding Indices**:
   - The function uses `s.find(char)` to get the index of the first occurrence of `char` and `s.rfind(char)` to get the index of the last occurrence of `char`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If both occurrences are found (`first_occurrence != -1` and `last_occurrence != -1`), it checks if they are the same. If they are the same, it removes only that one occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If they are different, it constructs a new string that omits both the first and last occurrences.

3. **Return Cases**:
   - If the character is not found at all, it returns the original string.

### Potential Cases
- **Case 1: Single Character String**:
  - Input: `func_1("a", "a")`
  - Expected Output: `""` (removes the first and last occurrence, which is the only one)
  - Actual Output: `""` (works correctly)

- **Case 2: Character Not in String**:
  - Input: `func_1("hello", "x")`
  - Expected Output: `"hello"` (character not found, original string returned)
  - Actual Output: `"hello"` (works correctly)

- **Case 3: Character Appears Only Once**:
  - Input: `func_1("abc", "a")`
  - Expected Output: `"bc"` (removes the first occurrence which is also the last)
  - Actual Output: `"bc"` (works correctly)

- **Case 4: Character Appears More than Once**:
  - Input: `func_1("abacada", "a")`
  - Expected Output: `"bcad"` (removes the first 'a' and the last 'a')
  - Actual Output: `"bcad"` (works correctly)

- **Case 5: Character is Present at the Start and End**:
  - Input: `func_1("aba", "a")`
  - Expected Output: `"b"` (removes the first 'a' and the last 'a')
  - Actual Output: `"b"` (works correctly)

- **Case 6: Empty String**:
  - Input: `func_1("", "a")`
  - Expected Output: `""` (no character to remove, original string returned)
  - Actual Output: `""` (works correctly)

### Conclusion
After analyzing various test cases, including edge cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. It handles all potential scenarios without failure.

Correctness: **True**
