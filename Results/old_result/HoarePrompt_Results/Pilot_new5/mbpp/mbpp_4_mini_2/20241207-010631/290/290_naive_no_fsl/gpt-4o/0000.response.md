Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` does not handle the case where the input string is too short. Specifically, if the string is of length 0, 1, or 2, the slicing `s[1:-1]` will not correctly check for the presence of 'z' in the valid range. 

For instance:
- If the input string is `'z'`, it should return `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
- If the input string is `'az'`, it should also return `False` as 'z' is at the end of the string.
- If the input string is `'ab'`, it should return `False` because it does not contain 'z' at all.

However, the function currently will treat any input string of length less than 3 as having 'z' not present (due to slicing), which does not align with the problem description. 

Thus, the function does not correctly handle all potential edge cases, resulting in the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
