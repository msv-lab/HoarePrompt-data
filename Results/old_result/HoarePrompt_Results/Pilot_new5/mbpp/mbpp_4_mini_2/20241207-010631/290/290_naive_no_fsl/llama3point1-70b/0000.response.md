Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where a word contains the letter 'z' at the end. For example, if the input string is "buzz", the program would return `False`, but according to the problem description, it should return `True` because 'z' is present in the word, albeit at the end of the word. 

Additionally, the program incorrectly assumes that words of length 1 should be ignored for 'z', but according to the problem statement, it doesn't specify anything about single-character words or the need to check them at all. This can lead to confusion about whether it should check 'z' in single-character words or not.

Thus, there are cases where the output of the program does not align with the requirements in the problem description.
