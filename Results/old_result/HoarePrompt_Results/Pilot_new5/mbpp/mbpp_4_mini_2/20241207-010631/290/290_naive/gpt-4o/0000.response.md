Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle cases where the input string has 'z' at the start or end, but also has 'z' elsewhere in the string. For instance, the input `'z'` should return `False`, but the program will incorrectly check an empty substring and return `False`, which is not in line with the requirements. 

Another case to consider is when there are multiple 'z's in the string, such as `'azb'`, which should return `True` because it has 'z' in the middle. However, the current implementation checks for 'z' in the slice `s[1:-1]`, and if `s` is of length 2 or less, it would not check properly.

Additionally, if the input string is just a space or non-character string like `'.'` or `' '`, the program should return `False` but will not handle such cases effectively given the slicing logic. 

Overall, the function does not correctly implement the logic as required by the problem statement.
