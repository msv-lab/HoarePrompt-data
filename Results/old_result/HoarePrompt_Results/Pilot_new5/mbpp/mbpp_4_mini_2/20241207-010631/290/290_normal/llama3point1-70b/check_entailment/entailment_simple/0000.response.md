Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description effectively. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and splits it into individual words using `s.split()`. This ensures that the program processes each word separately, as required.

2. **Checking for 'z'**: Inside the loop, for each word, the program checks two conditions:
   - The word must have a length greater than 1 (i.e., it is not a single-character word).
   - It checks if 'z' is present in the substring that excludes the first and last characters of the word (`word[1:-1]`).

3. **Return Values**:
   - If it finds any word that meets the above conditions, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the condition of containing 'z' (excluding the first and last positions) is satisfied.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a word, it returns `False`, indicating that no such word exists.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly avoids counting 'z' at the start or end of words by specifically checking the substring `word[1:-1]`. Thus, if a word starts or ends with 'z', it will not be mistakenly counted.

Overall, the program performs as required by the problem description, checking for the presence of 'z' in the appropriate part of each word and returning the correct boolean outcome based on the findings. Therefore, the program is correct.
