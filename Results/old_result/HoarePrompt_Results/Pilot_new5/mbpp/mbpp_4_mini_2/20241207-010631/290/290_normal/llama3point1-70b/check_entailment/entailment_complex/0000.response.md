Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(s)` is designed to determine if any word in the input string `s` contains the character 'z', while ensuring that 'z' is not located at the start or the end of the word.

2. **Splitting the String**: The input string `s` is split into individual words using `s.split()`. This correctly isolates each word for evaluation.

3. **Looping Through Words**: The program iterates over each word in the list `words`. This is appropriate since we need to check each word individually.

4. **Condition Check**: For each word, the function checks two conditions:
   - The word must have a length greater than 1 (`len(word) > 1`).
   - The character 'z' must be present in the substring that excludes the first and last characters of the word (`'z' in word[1:-1]`).

   This condition effectively satisfies the requirement of checking for 'z' only in the middle of the word (and not at the start or end).

5. **Return Values**: If a word meets the conditions, the function returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, it returns `False`.

Overall, the function adheres to the problem description by correctly identifying the presence of 'z' in the specified context and returning the appropriate boolean value based on the findings. There are no cases where the function would yield incorrect results as per the given requirements.
