The code provided is intended to check if a string contains the character 'z', but only if it is not located at the start or end of the string. 

Let's analyze the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False
```

1. **Initial Assessment**: 
   - The function checks if 'z' is present in the substring that excludes the first and the last characters of the input string `s`. This aligns with the problem description that specifies checking for 'z' except at the start and end of the word. 
   - However, the function does not handle cases where the length of `s` is less than 3. For strings of length 2 or less, `s[1:-1]` will yield an empty string, and the function will incorrectly return `False`.

2. **Output Hints Validation**:
   - The output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the length of `s` is less than 3, which can lead to incorrect behaviors. This is indeed accurate as per the implementation of the code. 
   - For example, if `s` is empty (`""`), or if it contains only one character (`"z"` or `"a"`), the function will return `False`, but it does not explicitly inform about the string's length or handle such cases gracefully.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `s = "z"`: The function would return `False`, which is correct.
   - If `s = "ab"`: The function would return `False`, which is correct.
   - If `s = "az"`: The function would return `False`, which is correct.
   - If `s = "abc"`: The function checks the substring `b`, which does not contain 'z', so it returns `False`, which is correct.
   - If `s = "a z b"`: The function would return `True`, which is correct because 'z' is present but not at the start or end.
   - If `s = "abz"`: The function would return `False`, which is correct because 'z' is at the end.

Given that the function fails to correctly handle cases where the length of `s` is less than 3, it does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program is incorrect because it does not handle strings of length less than 3 correctly, leading to potential issues in its output without any indication of input length.
