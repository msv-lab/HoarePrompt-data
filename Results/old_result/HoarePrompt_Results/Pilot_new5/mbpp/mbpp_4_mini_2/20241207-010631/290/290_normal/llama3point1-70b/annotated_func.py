#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`, and the loop checks all words in `words`. If no word with length greater than 1 containing 'z' in the substring that excludes the first and last characters is found, the function does not return True.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that no word with length greater than 1 containing 'z' in the substring that excludes the first and last characters was found in the list of words obtained from the string 's'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s`, splits it into words, and returns True if any word (with length greater than 1) contains the character 'z' within its substring that excludes the first and last characters. If no such word is found, it returns False.
