The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are floating-point numbers representing rectangular coordinates in a 2D Cartesian plane. It calculates the polar coordinates corresponding to these rectangular coordinates. The function computes `r`, the distance from the origin to the point (x, y), using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, and `theta`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y), using the `atan2` function. The function returns both `r` and `theta`.

The annotations incorrectly imply that `r` is solely the square root of `x`, omitting that it is derived from both `x` and `y`. Additionally, the annotations do not specify that `theta` corresponds to the angle derived from both `x` and `y`. There are no apparent edge cases handled for this function, such as the case when both `x` and `y` are zero, where `r` would be 0 and `theta` would be undefined but will return `0.0` due to the behavior of `atan2(0,0)`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two floating-point numbers `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates, and returns `r`, the distance from the origin to the point (x, y), and `theta`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y). **
