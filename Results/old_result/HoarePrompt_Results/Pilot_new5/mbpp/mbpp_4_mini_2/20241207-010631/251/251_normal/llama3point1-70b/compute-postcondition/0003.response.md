The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`, both of which are floating-point numbers representing rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, it calculates `r`, which is the hypotenuse determined by the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. Additionally, it calculates `phi`, which is the angle determined by the arctangent of the ratio of `y` to `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers `x` and `y`, and return two values: `r` as the hypotenuse and `phi` as the angle based on the provided coordinates. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, and returns r as the hypotenuse and phi as the angle based on the rectangular coordinates.**
