Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is defined after the assertions. This means that when the assertions are executed, the `func_1` function has not yet been defined, leading to a `NameError`. Therefore, the program does not work as expected. For example, if you run the provided assertions, it will raise an error:

```python
NameError: name 'func_1' is not defined
```

Since the program fails to execute correctly from the start due to this issue, it does not meet the problem description's requirements.
