The provided function, `func_1`, is designed to determine if a given list of integers contains consecutive numbers without duplicates. The logic of the function first sorts the list and then checks two conditions: whether all elements in the sorted list differ by exactly 1, and whether the length of the list matches the length of the set created from the list (to ensure there are no duplicates).

### Initial Assessment:
Upon reviewing the code, it seems to correctly implement the intended functionality. The sorting of the list should allow for a straightforward check of consecutive integers. The check for duplicates via the length comparison with the set is also appropriate.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: An empty list should return `False` since there are no consecutive numbers present.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with one element (e.g., `[5]`) should return `False` because it does not contain consecutive numbers.
3. **Non-Consecutive Numbers**: A list like `[1, 3, 2]` which contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3 but is not sorted initially should return `True` after sorting.
4. **Duplicates**: A list like `[1, 2, 2, 3]` should return `False` due to duplicates.

### Assessment of Output Hints:
The output hints agree with the logic of the function, stating that it returns `True` if the sorted list contains consecutive integers differing by 1, without duplicates, and `False` otherwise. This includes the edge cases noted above, suggesting that the function needs to handle the empty list and single element list scenarios correctly.

### Conclusion:
While the function correctly determines if a non-empty list contains consecutive numbers and does handle duplicates, it fails to account for the edge case of an empty list and a single-element list returning `False`, which is a requirement in the problem description for all cases to be correct. Therefore, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not return `False` for an empty list, which is a violation of the problem requirements.
