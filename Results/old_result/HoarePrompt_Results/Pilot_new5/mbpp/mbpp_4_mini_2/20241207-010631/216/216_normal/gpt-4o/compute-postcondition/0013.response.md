Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers containing at least 3 integers, and `i` is 2. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the function proceeds without returning a value.***
