To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the program logic:

**Problem Description:** 
The function should check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True
```
**Output Hints:** 
The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns False if the list is empty or if the sorted list does not contain at least two consecutive integers. If the sorted list contains at least two consecutive integers, it returns True. However, it does not check for lists with fewer than two elements; hence, if `lst` has only one element, it also returns False, which is an implicit edge case not stated in the annotations.

### Initial Assessment:
1. If the input list is empty, the function correctly returns `False`.
2. If the list has one element (e.g., `[1]`), the function will return `True` since it does not find any gaps, but it should logically return `False` because there are no consecutive numbers.
3. For lists with two or more elements, the function sorts the list and checks if every consecutive pair of numbers has a difference of one. This part of the function appears correct.
4. The function will correctly return `False` for lists like `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` as there is a gap between 3 and 5.

### Edge Cases:
- A single-element list should return `False`, but the current implementation does not handle this explicitly, as outlined in the output hints.
  
### Output Hints Confirmation:
The output hints mention that the function does not check for lists with fewer than two elements. Upon reviewing the code, if a single element is provided, the code will proceed to the sorting and consecutive checking, which will incorrectly yield `True`. Hence, the hints are accurate.

### Conclusion:
The program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case, specifically for lists that contain only one element. 

Correctness: **False**.
