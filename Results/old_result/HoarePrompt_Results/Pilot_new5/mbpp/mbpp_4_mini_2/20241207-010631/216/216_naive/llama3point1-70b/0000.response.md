To evaluate the given program based on the problem description, we need to check if the function correctly identifies whether a list contains consecutive numbers. 

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

1. **Sorting the list**: The program first sorts the list, which is essential for checking consecutiveness.

2. **Check for consecutive numbers**: The program then checks if every element in the sorted list is consecutive by verifying that the difference between adjacent elements is 1. This is done using a generator expression with `all()`.

3. **Unique elements**: The second part of the return statement checks if all elements in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list with the length of the set of the list (`len(lst) == len(set(lst))`).

### Edge Cases

- **Empty list** (`[]`): The program will return `True` since there are no elements to violate consecutiveness.
- **Single element list** (`[5]`): This will also return `True` since one number can be considered consecutively valid.
- **List of two non-consecutive numbers** (`[1, 3]`): This will return `False`, which is correct.
- **List with duplicates** (`[1, 2, 2, 3]`): This will return `False` for duplicates, which is also correct.
- **List with negative numbers** (`[-2, -1, 0, 1]`): The output would be `True` since all numbers are consecutive.

### Potential Failure Case

However, the program fails in the following edge case:
- **List with negative and positive non-consecutive numbers**: For example, for the input `[-1, 0, 2]`, the sorted list would be `[-1, 0, 2]`, and the check for consecutive numbers would return `False`. However, if we had a valid input like `[0, 1, 2]`, it would also return `True` correctly.

However, the program does not handle cases correctly where it should consider the full range of negative to positive numbers. The current behavior assumes that the numbers must be strictly increasing by 1 without considering if they can be consecutive across negative to positive transitions.

Given these evaluations, I can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

The program does not cover the full range of possibilities for confirming if a list contains consecutive numbers, particularly in cases of mixed negative and positive values where the entire range needs to be checked for continuity.
