Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to check if a list contains consecutive numbers. However, it does not handle cases where the list may contain negative numbers or is not sorted in ascending order. 

For example, consider the input `func_1([3, 2, 1])`. The expected output is `True` because the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are consecutive. However, since the function sorts the list, it will correctly identify these as consecutive numbers. 

Now consider the case of negative numbers. For input `func_1([-2, -1, 0, 1])`, the expected output should be `False` because the sequence is not consecutive in the context of whole numbers. The implementation considers negative numbers but does not handle whether the range across zero is considered consecutive. 

Furthermore, the function does not return `True` for input like `func_1([1, 3])` (which would return `False` correctly), but misses out on other edge cases.

Thus, while the program works for basic cases, it does not cover all potential cases and fails to meet the problem's requirements in this regard.
