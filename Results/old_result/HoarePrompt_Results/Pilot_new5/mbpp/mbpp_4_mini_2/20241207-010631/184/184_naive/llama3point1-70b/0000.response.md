Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` is intended to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. However, it incorrectly uses the condition `num % 2 != 0`, which returns the odd numbers, but it does not handle the case when the input list `nums` is empty. In this case, the function will return an empty list, which is correct. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle non-integer inputs or mixed types in the list, which could cause an error. For example:

```python
func_1([1, 2, 'three', 4])
```

This input will raise a `TypeError` when it attempts to evaluate the condition `num % 2` on a string. Therefore, the function fails to correctly filter odd numbers in all potential cases as it does not account for the possibility of non-integer values in the input list.
