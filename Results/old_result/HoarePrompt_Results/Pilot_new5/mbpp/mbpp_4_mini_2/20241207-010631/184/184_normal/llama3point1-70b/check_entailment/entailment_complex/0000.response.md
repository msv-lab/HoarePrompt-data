Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement described in the problem description, which is to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the list. For each integer, it checks if the number is odd by evaluating the condition `num % 2 != 0`. If the condition is true, the integer is included in the resulting list.

The following points validate that the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list of integers (`nums`), which aligns with the expected input type as stated in the problem description.

2. **Correct Filtering**: The key operation in the list comprehension (`num % 2 != 0`) correctly identifies all odd integers. This adheres to the requirement of filtering odd numbers.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list that contains only the odd integers from the input list. If there are no odd integers or if the input list is empty, it returns an empty list, which is also acceptable according to the problem description.

4. **General Case Coverage**: The function does not impose any restrictions on the contents of the list other than expecting integers, and it correctly handles all potential cases of empty lists or lists without odd integers by returning an empty list.

Overall, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description, consistently filtering out the odd integers and handling edge cases gracefully. Therefore, it is correct.
