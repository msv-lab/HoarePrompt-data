The code provided is intended to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. The function `func_1(nums)` iterates through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2 != 0`, which denotes odd numbers.

Initially assessing the code against the problem description, it appears to perform the required task: it filters out even numbers and retains only odd numbers. It will return an empty list if the input list is empty, which aligns with the expected behavior as there are no odd numbers to filter.

Next, we need to examine the output hints. The hints clarify that the function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing all integers from `nums` that are odd. Furthermore, they specify that the function does not handle specific cases for empty lists or non-integer values, but will return an empty list if `nums` is empty or if there are no odd integers. These points are consistent with the function's behavior, which correctly handles the case of an empty input list.

However, the hints mention that the function does not handle non-integer values. For instance, if the input list contains strings or floating-point numbers, the code will raise a `TypeError` because the modulo operator `%` is not defined for types other than integers. This oversight indicates that the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as the description does not specify that the input must strictly be integers.

Therefore, there is a case where the program does not work correctly: when it receives a list that includes non-integer types.

Correctness: **False**.
