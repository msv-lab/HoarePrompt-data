Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the requirement of filtering odd numbers from a list of integers. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the odd integers from the input list.

The assertions provided in the annotated program verify that the function behaves as expected:

1. The first assertion checks that given the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are the odd numbers in that list.
2. The second assertion uses the input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]` and confirms that the output is `[45, 67, 93]`, again correctly identifying the odd numbers.
3. The third assertion tests the input `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]` and verifies that the output returned is `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, which accurately reflects all the odd integers present.

The function includes appropriate logic to filter out odd numbers by checking if each number is not divisible by 2 (`num % 2 != 0`). This ensures that all odd integers are included in the resulting list, while even integers are excluded.

Moreover, if the input list is empty or contains no odd integers, the function correctly returns an empty list, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement. 

Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem description and meets all the specified requirements.
