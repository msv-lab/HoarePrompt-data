Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to filter odd numbers, which implies that it should return only the odd numbers. However, the function's implementation returns a list of integers that are odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`), which is correct in itself. But if we consider the terminology, "filter" typically suggests not just returning these numbers but rather a modification of the original list, which could imply operations such as removing those odd numbers from the list or presenting them in a different manner (like counting them or returning them in a specific format).

However, the primary issue arises from the perceived expectation of the term "filter" that might suggest a more comprehensive processing of the input. Since the problem description is rather vague about the exact nature of filtering (e.g., it could imply returning counts or handling empty cases differently), it does not strictly define the output format that might be expected. 

Therefore, while the program correctly identifies and returns odd numbers from the input list, the interpretation of "filter" leaves room for ambiguity, which is why it does not fully satisfy the problem description as intended.
