#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, h, and l are positive numbers representing the base length, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as (base length * height / 2) * length, where b is the base length, h is the height, and l is the length of the prism.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive numbers `b`, `h`, and `l`, which represent the base length, height, and length of a triangular prism, respectively. It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula (base length * height / 2) * length. There are no checks for negative or zero values for the input parameters, so the function assumes they are always positive.
