Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the formula: 

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length} \]

Where the base area of a triangle is given by:

\[ \text{Base Area} = 0.5 \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \]

The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. It computes the triangular base area correctly and multiplies it by the length of the prism to return the volume. 

The assertions provided test the function with different sets of values, and the outputs match the expected results:

1. For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`: 
   - Base Area = 0.5 * 10 * 8 = 40
   - Volume = 40 * 6 = 240 (Correct)

2. For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`:
   - Base Area = 0.5 * 3 * 2 = 3
   - Volume = 3 * 2 = 6 (Correct)

3. For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`:
   - Base Area = 0.5 * 1 * 2 = 1
   - Volume = 1 * 1 = 1 (Correct)

No edge cases or potential failures were identified, as the function appears to handle valid input values correctly and adheres to the problem description for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. Therefore, the code is correct for the given problem.
