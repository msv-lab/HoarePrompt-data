Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to get the angle (or phase) of a complex number. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Complex Number Representation**: The program takes two floating-point numbers `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. This aligns with the conventional representation of complex numbers.

2. **Creating the Complex Number**: The line `complex_num = complex(real, imag)` correctly creates a complex number object from the given real and imaginary parts.

3. **Calculating the Angle**: The use of `cmath.phase(complex_num)` properly computes the phase angle of the complex number. The `cmath` module is specifically designed for complex number operations, and the `phase` function returns the angle in radians, which is the standard mathematical representation for the angle of a complex number.

4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns the calculated phase angle, which is the expected output according to the problem description.

Since the program correctly handles all aspects of calculating the angle of a complex number, we conclude that it fully complies with the requirements specified in the problem description.
