Functionality: ** The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It returns the phase (or argument) of the complex number constructed from these parts. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in the code, as it correctly computes the phase for any valid floating-point input. **
