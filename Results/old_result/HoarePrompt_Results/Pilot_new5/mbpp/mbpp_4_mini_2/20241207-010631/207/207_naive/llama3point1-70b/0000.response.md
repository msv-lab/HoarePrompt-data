Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(length, width)` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. It handles all valid inputs appropriately, including both positive and negative values, as well as zero. However, in the context of calculating the area of a rectangle, negative length or width does not make sense in practical scenarios, but the function will still return a mathematical product. Given the problem description does not specify constraints on the values, the function remains valid for all potential inputs according to the mathematical operation defined. Thus, there are no input cases where the function fails to meet the requirements described in the problem.
