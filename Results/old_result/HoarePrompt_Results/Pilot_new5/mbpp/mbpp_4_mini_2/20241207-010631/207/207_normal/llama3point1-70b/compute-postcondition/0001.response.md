The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` are non-negative integers or floats that represent the dimensions of a rectangle. The function calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `length` by `width` and returns this value. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept non-negative dimensions of a rectangle and return the area calculated from those dimensions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters length and width, both of which are non-negative integers or floats, and returns the area of the rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width.**
