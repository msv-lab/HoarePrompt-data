#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as length multiplied by width, where both length and width are non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are non-negative integers or floats. It calculates and returns the area of a rectangle by multiplying `length` by `width`. The function does not check for negative values or handle any potential errors (e.g., if the inputs are not numbers), and thus assumes that the inputs provided are valid non-negative numbers.
