Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the function to find the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases, and they all yield the expected results: 

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `200`, which is correct for a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20.
- `func_1(10, 5)` returns `50`, which is correct for length 10 and width 5.
- `func_1(4, 2)` returns `8`, which is also correct for length 4 and width 2.

Additionally, the function will work for any non-negative values for length and width, as negative dimensions do not make sense in the context of calculating area. Since I could not find any edge cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, it adheres to the specified requirements.
