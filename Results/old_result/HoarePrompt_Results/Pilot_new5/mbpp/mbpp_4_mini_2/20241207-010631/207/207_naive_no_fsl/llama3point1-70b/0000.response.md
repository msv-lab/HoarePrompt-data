Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(length, width)` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. 

1. **Positive Values:** For positive values of length and width, the calculation is correct (e.g., `func_1(4, 5)` returns `20`).
2. **Zero Values:** If either length or width is zero (e.g., `func_1(0, 5)` or `func_1(4, 0)`), it correctly returns `0`, which is the expected area of a rectangle with zero dimension.
3. **Negative Values:** The function does not explicitly handle negative values, but mathematically, the area can also be computed by multiplying negative numbers, resulting in a positive area. However, in a geometrical interpretation, a rectangle with negative dimensions does not make sense. The program does not account for this potential misuse of negative dimensions.
4. **Type Handling:** The function does not handle cases where the inputs are not numeric (e.g., strings or None), which could lead to a runtime error.

While the function works correctly for all typical inputs (non-negative numeric values), the failure to handle negative dimensions or non-numeric types could lead to incorrect usage in certain contexts. However, since there is no explicit requirement in the problem description about input validation or constraints on dimensions, and since it behaves as expected for valid cases, it can be considered correct in terms of the calculations performed. 

Thus, there are no specific cases where it fails based on the provided description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
