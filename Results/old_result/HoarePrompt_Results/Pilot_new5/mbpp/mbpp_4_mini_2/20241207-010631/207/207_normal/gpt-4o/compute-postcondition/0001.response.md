The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` are non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of a rectangle. After executing the function body, it calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `length` by `width`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-negative dimensions of a rectangle and return the area calculated as the product of these dimensions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters length and width and returns the area of the rectangle, calculated as length multiplied by width.**
