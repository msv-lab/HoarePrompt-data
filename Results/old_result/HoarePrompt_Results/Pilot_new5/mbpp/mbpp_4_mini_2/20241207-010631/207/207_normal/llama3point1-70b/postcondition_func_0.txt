The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, both of which are expected to be non-negative integers or floats. It calculates and returns the area of a rectangle by multiplying `length` by `width`. However, the function does not handle negative input values or check for invalid data types, so if negative values or non-numeric types are passed, it may lead to erroneous results or exceptions.
