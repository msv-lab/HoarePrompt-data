Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, which represent the dimensions of a rectangle. It then returns the area of the rectangle calculated by multiplying these two parameters (`length * width`). 

Since the problem description specifically asks for a function that calculates the area of a rectangle based on its length and width, and the program adheres to this requirement by performing the correct computation and returning the appropriate result, it meets the problem's expectations. Additionally, the parameters are specified to be non-negative integers or floats, which aligns with common geometric practices for calculating area. 

Therefore, the program is complete and accurate in its functionality as defined by the problem description.
