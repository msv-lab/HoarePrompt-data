The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are non-negative integers or floats. It calculates and returns the area of a rectangle by multiplying `length` by `width`. The function does not check for negative values or handle any potential errors (e.g., if the inputs are not numbers), and thus assumes that the inputs provided are valid non-negative numbers.
