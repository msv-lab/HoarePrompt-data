Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks if the given month number, `n`, is one of the months that contain 31 days. It does this by checking if `n` is in the predefined list `months_31_days`, which includes the month numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) that correspond to January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. 

The function will return `True` for these month numbers and `False` for all others (including February, April, June, September, and November). As such, it fulfills the problem description without any missing logic or edge cases.
