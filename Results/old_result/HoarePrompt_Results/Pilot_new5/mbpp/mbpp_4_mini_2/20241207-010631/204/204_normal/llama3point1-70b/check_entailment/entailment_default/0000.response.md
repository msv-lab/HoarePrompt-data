The program is designed to check whether a given month number (represented by the integer `n`) corresponds to a month that has 31 days. The valid month numbers that correspond to 31 days are: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

Looking at the code, it checks if the month number `n` is present in the list `months_31_days`. If `n` is one of the defined month numbers, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

However, the problem description implies that the function should handle the case for any integer month value, but the code does not explicitly handle invalid month numbers (i.e., any integer outside the range of 1 to 12). According to the output hints, it assumes that `n` is between 1 and 12 but does not handle cases where `n` is outside this range.

Now, examining the output hints, they confirm that the function is supposed to return `True` for the valid month numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and `False` for the others. However, they also indicate that the function does not account for values of `n` that are out of bounds, such as 0 or 13, which should not return any valid result.

Given that the program does not handle all potential cases as stipulated in the problem description (specifically invalid month numbers), we can conclude that the program is indeed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle edge cases such as `n = 0` or `n = 13`. A call with these values would return `False`, but the expected behavior for such invalid inputs isn't defined in the problem description.
