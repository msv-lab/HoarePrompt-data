Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that checks if the given month number `n` contains 31 days. 

Hereâ€™s how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function accepts an integer `n`, which is constrained to the range 1 to 12, representing the twelve months of the year.
2. **Logic**: The program utilizes a list `months_31_days` that explicitly contains the month numbers which have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).
3. **Check**: It checks if the month number `n` is in the list of months with 31 days using the `in` keyword. This operation returns `True` if `n` is one of the months in the list and `False` otherwise.
4. **Output**: The function returns a boolean value that accurately reflects whether the month number contains 31 days, complying with the problem's request.

Since the program functionally checks the specific months that contain 31 days and returns the appropriate boolean result, it fulfills the requirements of the problem statement for all valid inputs.
