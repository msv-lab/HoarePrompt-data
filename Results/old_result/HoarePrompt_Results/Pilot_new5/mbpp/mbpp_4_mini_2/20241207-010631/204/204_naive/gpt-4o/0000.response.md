Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input is a month number outside the range of 1 to 12. For example, if we call `func_1(13)`, it will return `False`, but January (month 1) through December (month 12) should be the only valid inputs. The program does not raise an error or return a specific output indicating the input is invalid; it simply checks against the set of months with 31 days, which is not the intended behavior as per the problem description. Thus, the program is incorrect as it fails to account for invalid month numbers.
