Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the month number and returns `True` if `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12); otherwise, it returns `False`. It assumes `n` is between 1 and 12, inclusive, but does not handle cases where `n` is outside this range.**
