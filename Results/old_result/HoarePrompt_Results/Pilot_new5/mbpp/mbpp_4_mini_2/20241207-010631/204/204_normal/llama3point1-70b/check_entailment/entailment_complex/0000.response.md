Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a given month number corresponds to a month with 31 days. Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` that represents the month number, with the assumption that `n` is in the valid range of 1 to 12.

2. The list `months_31_days` contains the month numbers that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

3. The program uses the expression `n in months_31_days` to check if the month number `n` is included in the list of months that have 31 days. If it is found in the list, the function returns `True`; if not, it returns `False`.

4. The program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description, which states that it must determine whether the month represented by `n` contains 31 days or not.

5. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range 1 to 12, but according to the provided assumptions in the annotations, we consider that `n` will always be within this range. Therefore, it correctly fulfills the problem's requirements for valid month numbers.

As a result, the program behaves as specified in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.
