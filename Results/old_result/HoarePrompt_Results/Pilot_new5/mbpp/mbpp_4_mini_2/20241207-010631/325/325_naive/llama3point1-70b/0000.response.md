Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies whether a given month number contains 30 days. The months that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November) are correctly listed in the `thirty_days_months` array. The function checks if the input month is in this list. 

All potential input cases (1 to 12) are handled correctly:
- Months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11) will return `True`.
- Months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and February (2) will return `False`.

Since the function behaves as expected for all valid input cases, I conclude that it is correct.
