Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a month number (an integer from 1 to 12) as input and checks whether this month has 30 days. 

Hereâ€™s why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Range**: The function is designed to accept an integer representing the month, as specified by the problem description (from 1 to 12).

2. **Months with 30 Days**: The function identifies the months that contain 30 days (April, June, September, and November) by using a list called `thirty_days_months` which includes the respective month numbers [4, 6, 9, 11].

3. **Membership Test**: The use of the expression `month in thirty_days_months` correctly checks if the provided month is one of those months with 30 days. If it is, the function returns `True`. If it is not, the function returns `False`.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Given that the input is guaranteed to be within the specified range (1 to 12), the function effectively covers all valid cases for the problem.

In conclusion, the function adheres to the problem description by accurately determining whether the given month has 30 days. Hence, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
