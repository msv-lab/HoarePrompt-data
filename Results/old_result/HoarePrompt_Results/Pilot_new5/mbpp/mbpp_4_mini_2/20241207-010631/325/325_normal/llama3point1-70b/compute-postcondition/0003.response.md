Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `month` and returns `True` if `month` is either 4, 6, 9, or 11 (the months with 30 days). It returns `False` for all other valid months (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) without any additional error handling for out-of-bounds input, as it assumes `month` is always between 1 and 12 inclusive. **
