To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both.

**Problem Description:** The task is to write a function that checks whether the given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` is supposed to return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise.
2. The set `months_with_30_days` correctly includes the months that have 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).
3. It tests the function with three assertions:
   - `func_1(6) == True`: June has 30 days, so this is correct.
   - `func_1(2) == False`: February has 28 or 29 days, so this is correct.
   - `func_1(12) == False`: December has 31 days, so this is correct.

### Missing Logic:
However, the function does not handle the months that have either 31 days or February (which can have 28 or 29 days). Specifically, it does not return an output for the months that are not in the set, such as:
- January (1): 31 days - should return `False`
- March (3): 31 days - should return `False`
- May (5): 31 days - should return `False`
- July (7): 31 days - should return `False`
- August (8): 31 days - should return `False`
- October (10): 31 days - should return `False`
- December (12): 31 days - should return `False`

Since the function only checks if a month is in the set and does not account for months with 31 days and also does not handle edge cases for invalid month inputs (like 0 or 13), it is not correctly verifying all potential cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

The function is not correct because it does not return the expected value for months that are not in the set. For example, `func_1(1)` should return `False`, but the function does not handle this case.
