The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `month` which is expected to be in the range from 1 to 12, inclusive. It checks whether the `month` is one of the months that have 30 days, specifically April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). If `month` matches one of these values, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no explicit checks in the function to handle invalid inputs outside the specified range, but the precondition assumes that the input will be valid. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine if a given month has 30 days based on the specified months.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `month` and returns True if it corresponds to a month with 30 days (April, June, September, November); otherwise, it returns False. **
