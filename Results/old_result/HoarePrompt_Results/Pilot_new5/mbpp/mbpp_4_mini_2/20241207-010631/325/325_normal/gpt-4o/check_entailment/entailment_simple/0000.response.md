Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days or not. However, the program only identifies months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) but does not account for other months such as February, which has 28 or 29 days, and months like January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which have 31 days.

The assertions provided in the annotated program also do not correctly cover all cases. For example:

- The assertion `assert func_1(2) == False` is incorrect because February (month 2) does not have 30 days, which is correct. 
- The assertion `assert func_1(12) == False` is incorrect because December (month 12) has 31 days, which is not accounted for in the set.

Thus, the program fails to correctly identify all months based on the problem's requirements, leading to incorrect results for months with 31 days. This lack of comprehensive checking makes the program incorrect.
