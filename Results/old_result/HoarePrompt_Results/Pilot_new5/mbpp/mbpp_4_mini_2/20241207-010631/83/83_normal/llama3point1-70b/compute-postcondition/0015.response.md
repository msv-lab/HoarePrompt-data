According to the code, the for loop executes while `size` starts from `n` and decrements down to 1. Since the range is specified as `range(n, 0, -1)`, `size` will take values from `n` down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is equal to 1 (the last value in the range). 

To execute the loop one more time, `size` must be decremented to 0, but since the loop terminates when `size` reaches 0, the next iteration will not occur. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure at least one previous iteration can happen. 

Since the loop body modifies `arr`, and `max_index` is determined based on the maximum element in `arr[:size]`, it implies that before the next possible execution, `max_index` will still point to the maximum element in `arr[:size]` for the current value of `size`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `size` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:1]`.**
