According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to n-1, which means it will execute as long as n is greater than 1. Given that `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `max_index` is 0 before entering the loop. So, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_index` is 0**
