The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 3. The previous condition states that if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`, then `max_index` may be updated to 3. However, this does not affect the assignment operation that occurs in the code. Thus, `max_index` is now 3 regardless of the comparison, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `max_index` is 3.**
