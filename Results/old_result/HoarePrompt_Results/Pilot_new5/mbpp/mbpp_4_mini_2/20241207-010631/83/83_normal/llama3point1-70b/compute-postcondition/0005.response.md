The code snippet reverses a portion of the list `arr` from the beginning up to `max_index + 1`. The `size` variable remains unchanged as it was not affected directly by the operation. The conditions state that `max_index` is neither at the beginning nor at the end of the list, allowing for an effective reversal within the specified range.

After executing the code, the list `arr` will have its elements from the start up to `max_index` reversed, while the rest of the list remains intact. The states of the other variables, including `n`, `size`, and `max_index`, remain the same.

Output State: **`arr` has elements from the start up to `max_index` reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is now `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]` and is not equal to `size - 1`, and is also not equal to 0.**
