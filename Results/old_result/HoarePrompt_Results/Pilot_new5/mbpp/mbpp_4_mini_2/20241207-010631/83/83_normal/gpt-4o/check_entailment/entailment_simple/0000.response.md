The provided program is intended to sort a list of elements, but it has several issues that prevent it from accomplishing this task correctly.

1. **Sorting Order**: The program is designed to sort the list in descending order, as indicated by the comments in the `func_1` function. However, the problem description explicitly states that the function should sort a list of elements without specifying the order. This creates a mismatch between what the program does and what the problem requires.

2. **Global Variable Access**: The `flip` and `find_max_index` functions depend on a variable `arr` which is not passed as a parameter. This makes the program reliant on a global variable, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or errors if `arr` is not properly defined in the global scope. This violates good programming practices and can potentially lead to bugs.

3. **Functionality Issues**: The `flip` function modifies `arr` in place but does so without any checks or balances, which can lead to unintended side effects.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, as it does not sort the list in a specified order (ascending or descending) and relies on a global variable which could lead to errors.

Correctness: **False**
