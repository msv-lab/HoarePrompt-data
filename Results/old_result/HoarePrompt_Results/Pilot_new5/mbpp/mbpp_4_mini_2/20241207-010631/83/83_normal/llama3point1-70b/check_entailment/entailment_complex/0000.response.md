Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to sort a list of elements. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to take a list `arr` of comparable elements and sorts them in ascending order. It uses a selection sort-like approach, which is a valid sorting method.

2. **In-place Sorting**: The function modifies the original list in place, which is consistent with the problem description's implication of sorting a list of elements.

3. **Correct Output**: After executing the sorting mechanism, the function returns the sorted list, ensuring that the final output is indeed the sorted version of the input list.

4. **Iterative Approach**: The use of a loop that runs `n` times (where `n` is the length of the list) ensures that each element is correctly positioned in the sorted order.

5. **Annotations**: The annotations accurately describe the state of the program before and after execution, confirming that the function successfully sorts the list.

Given that the function correctly sorts the list as required by the problem description for all comparable input cases, the conclusion is that it is correct. Therefore, the function fulfills its intended purpose as stated.
