The code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the elements in the list `arr` from the start up to the index `size`. The initial state specifies that `max_index` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `size - 1`, implying that the first part of `arr` is being reversed but only up to `max_index` and not the entire `arr`. 

Since `max_index` is less than `size - 1`, the portion of the list `arr` from the start to `max_index` will be reversed.

The output state now reflects that the portion of `arr` has been reversed while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with elements reversed from the start up to `max_index`, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is now `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]` and is not equal to 0 or `size - 1`.**
