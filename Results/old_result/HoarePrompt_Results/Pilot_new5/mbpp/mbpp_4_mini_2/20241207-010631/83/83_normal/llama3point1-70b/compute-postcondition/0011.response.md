The code reverses the sublist of `arr` that extends from the start of the list up to and including the element at the `max_index`. The values of `arr`, `n`, `size`, and `max_index` do not change except for the order of elements in the sublist. 

`arr` is modified such that the elements from the beginning of the list up to `max_index + 1` are reversed. The values of `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is modified with the first `max_index + 1` elements reversed; `n` is greater than 0; `size` is now `n - 1`; `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]**
