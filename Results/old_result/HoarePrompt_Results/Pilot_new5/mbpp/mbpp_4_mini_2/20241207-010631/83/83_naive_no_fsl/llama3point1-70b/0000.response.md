To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description ("Write a function to sort a list of elements"), we need to carefully analyze the code.

The program attempts to sort a list using a selection-like mechanism, where it finds the maximum value in the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the end by reversing portions of the list. However, there are several issues that arise when examining the logic:

1. **Repeated Maximum Index Calculation**: The use of `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` can lead to incorrect behavior when there are duplicate maximum values. For example, if the list is `[3, 1, 2, 3]`, the `max_index` will always point to the first occurrence of the maximum value, which can lead to improper sorting.

2. **Inefficient Reversal Logic**: The logic to reverse segments of the list to sort it is not guaranteed to produce a sorted list. The algorithm does not inherently ensure that the entire list becomes sorted, especially if there are multiple maximum values found at various stages.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases like an empty list or a list with a single element correctly. While it might not crash, it won't provide a sorted output as one might expect.

4. **Unsorted Output**: For some inputs like `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, the function may not yield a sorted output because the logic does not correctly reposition elements after multiple reversals. 

To illustrate an example where the program fails:

- Input: `[3, 1, 2, 3]`
  - The first call to `max()` will return `3`, and the `max_index` will be `0`, leading to an incorrect sorting.
  
Thus, due to duplicate handling, logic flaws in the sorting mechanism, and potential edge case mishandlings, we conclude that the program does not meet the requirement to sort a list of elements correctly.

Correctness: **False**
