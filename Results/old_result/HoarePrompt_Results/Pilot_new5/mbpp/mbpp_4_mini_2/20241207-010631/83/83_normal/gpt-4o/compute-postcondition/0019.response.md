The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of elements of any type and must have a length greater than 1. After executing the function body, it returns the sorted list `arr` in descending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` containing elements of any type (with length greater than 1) and return that list sorted in descending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list arr of elements of any type (with length greater than 1) and returns the sorted list in descending order.**
