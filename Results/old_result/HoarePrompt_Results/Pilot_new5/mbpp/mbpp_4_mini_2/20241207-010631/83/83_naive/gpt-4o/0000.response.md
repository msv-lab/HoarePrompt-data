The provided code attempts to implement a sorting function, but it has several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly.

1. **Scope of Variables**: The function `find_max_index` is trying to access the variable `arr`, which is not defined within its scope. The variable `arr` needs to be passed as an argument to `find_max_index` for it to work properly.

2. **Incorrect Logic in Flip**: The `flip` function modifies `arr` without it being passed in as an argument, which means it will not operate correctly on the intended input list. The function should be defined as `def flip(arr, end):` and the variable `arr` should be passed when calling `flip`.

3. **Unintended Behavior**: The program logic attempts to sort the list, but if the initial input list is empty or contains only one element, it won't handle these cases properly since the outer loop in `func_1` expects at least two elements to function correctly.

4. **Potential Infinite Loop**: If the list is not being sorted correctly due to the aforementioned issues, it could lead to an infinite loop or unexpected results.

Given these points, the program does not satisfy the requirement to sort a list of elements correctly.

Correctness: **False**.

A case that demonstrates incorrect behavior is calling `func_1([])`, which would not return any meaningful result and would not handle an empty input correctly.
