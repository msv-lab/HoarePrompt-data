Functionality: ** The function `find_max_index` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the length of an external list `arr` and returns the index of the maximum value in `arr`. However, it assumes that `arr` is defined in the broader scope, which could lead to a NameError if `arr` is not accessible. Additionally, if `n` is 0, the function does not handle this edge case, which could also result in an IndexError when trying to access elements of `arr`. The function does not explicitly handle scenarios where `arr` has only one element or if all elements are equal. **
