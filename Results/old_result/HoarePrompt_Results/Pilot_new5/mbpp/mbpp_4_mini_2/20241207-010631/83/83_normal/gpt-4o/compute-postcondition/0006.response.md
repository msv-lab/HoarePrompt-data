`max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The previous value of `max_index` was 1, but it is now updated. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `max_index` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `max_index` is now 2**
