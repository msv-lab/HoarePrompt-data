Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is now `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`. If `max_index` is not 0, then `arr` is modified with the first `max_index + 1` elements reversed. If `max_index` is 0, no modifications are made to `arr`.***
