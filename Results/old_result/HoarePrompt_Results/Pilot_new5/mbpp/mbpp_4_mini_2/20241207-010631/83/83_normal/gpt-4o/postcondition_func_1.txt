The function accepts a non-negative integer `end` representing the index of the last element in the list `arr`, and it reverses the elements of `arr` from index `0` to `end`. This function assumes that `arr` is defined globally; if `end` is less than `0`, the function will not perform any operations, effectively resulting in no changes to `arr`.
