According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`, then `max_index` may be updated to 3. If `arr[i]` is not greater than `arr[max_index]`, `max_index` remains unchanged.**
