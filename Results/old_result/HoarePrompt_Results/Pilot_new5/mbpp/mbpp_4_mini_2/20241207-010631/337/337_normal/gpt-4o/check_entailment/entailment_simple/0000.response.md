The provided program is intended to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the implementation in the function `func_1` uses `set(lst)` to find the unique elements but does not correctly identify the non-repeated elements as specified in the problem description.

To clarify, the function `set(lst)` returns all unique elements, which includes elements that may appear more than once. The problem description specifically requires the sum of elements that do not repeat at all in the list. 

For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which sum to `20`, but `func_1` would return `21` because it includes `1`, which is a repeated element.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be established as follows:

Correctness: **False**

The function does not correctly implement the requirement of summing only the non-repeated elements, as it sums all unique elements instead.
