Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(lst)` that calculates the sum of non-repeated (or unique) elements in the given list `lst`.

Hereâ€™s how it meets the problem description:

1. **Non-repeated Elements**: The program checks each element `i` in the list `lst` using the condition `lst.count(i) == 1`. This condition ensures that only elements that appear exactly once in the list are considered.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program uses the built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total of these unique elements. The generator expression `(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)` generates the list of unique elements to be summed.

3. **Input and Output**: The function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the non-repeated integers, which aligns with the requirement of the problem description.

The implementation works correctly for all potential cases, including lists with no repeated elements, lists with all repeated elements, and lists with a mix of repeated and non-repeated elements. Hence, it fulfills the problem's requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the list.
