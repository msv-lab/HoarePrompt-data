To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1(snake_case_str)`.

The function is designed to convert a snake case string (where words are separated by underscores) into a camel case string (where the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no underscores).

### Breakdown of the code:
1. The input string `snake_case_str` is split into words using `split('_')`.
2. Each word in the resulting list is capitalized using `word.capitalize()`.
3. The capitalized words are joined together without spaces using `''.join(...)`.
4. Finally, the resulting string is returned.

### Considerations:
- A snake case string can have leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive underscores.
- The program does not handle these edge cases correctly.

### Test Cases:
1. Input: `snake_case_str = "hello_world"`  
   Output: `HelloWorld` (Correct)

2. Input: `snake_case_str = "snake_case_example"`  
   Output: `SnakeCaseExample` (Correct)

3. Input: `snake_case_str = "singleword"`  
   Output: `Singleword` (Correct)

4. Input: `snake_case_str = "_leading_underscore"`  
   Output: `LeadingUnderscore` (Correct)

5. Input: `snake_case_str = "trailing_underscore_"`  
   Output: `TrailingUnderscore` (Correct)

6. Input: `snake_case_str = "__multiple___underscores__"`  
   Output: `MultipleUnderscores` (Incorrect)  
   The expected output should be a string that properly handles consecutive underscores, potentially resulting in nothing or just the capitalized words without leaving gaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided function does not correctly handle multiple consecutive underscores or leading/trailing underscores, which can lead to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

The case with multiple consecutive underscores demonstrates that the program does not work as expected.
