In this case, the variable `components` is assigned the result of splitting the `snake_str` variable by underscores. Given that `snake_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores and contains at least one underscore, the split operation will create a list of substrings that were separated by underscores.

For instance, if `snake_str` is "hello_world", the `components` variable will be assigned the value `["hello", "world"]`. If `snake_str` were "a_b_c", it would become `["a", "b", "c"]`.

The important aspect here is that `components` will always be a list of strings that were separated by underscores in the original `snake_str`.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, and it contains at least one underscore; `components` is a list of strings created by splitting `snake_str` at each underscore.**
