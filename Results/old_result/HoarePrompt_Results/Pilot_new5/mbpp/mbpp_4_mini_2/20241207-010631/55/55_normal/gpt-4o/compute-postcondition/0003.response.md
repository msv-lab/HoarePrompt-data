The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `snake_str`, which is guaranteed to contain at least one underscore and consists of lowercase letters and underscores. The function splits this string into components at each underscore and then capitalizes the first letter of each component. Finally, it joins these capitalized components together into a single string without any separators.

The functionality covers the following points:
- The input string is expected to have at least one underscore.
- The function will work correctly for any valid input string that fits the criteria, transforming it into a camel case format (e.g., "this_is_a_test" becomes "ThisIsATest").
- There are no cases handled for empty or malformed strings, but since the precondition states there is at least one underscore, the function's behavior is predictable under the described constraints.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `snake_str` containing lowercase letters and underscores, and returns a string formed by joining the capitalized segments of `snake_str` split by underscores, effectively converting it into camel case. **
