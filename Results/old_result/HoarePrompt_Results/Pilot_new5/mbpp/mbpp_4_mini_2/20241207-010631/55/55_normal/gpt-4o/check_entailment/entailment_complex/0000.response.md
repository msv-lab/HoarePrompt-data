Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the conversion from snake case to camel case. The issue lies in the handling of the first word in the snake case string. In camel case notation, the first word should not be capitalized. 

For instance, the expected output for `'python_program'` is `'pythonProgram'`, but the program incorrectly returns `'PythonProgram'`. This error occurs for all inputs, as the function capitalizes the first component regardless of its position in the string.

Thus, the function fails to adhere to the requirements of the problem description, leading to incorrect results for the given test cases.
