The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are numbers. After executing the function body, it returns the values of `b` and `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two numbers, `a` and `b`, and return them in reverse order as `b` followed by `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, returns the values of `b` and `a`, where both are numbers.**
