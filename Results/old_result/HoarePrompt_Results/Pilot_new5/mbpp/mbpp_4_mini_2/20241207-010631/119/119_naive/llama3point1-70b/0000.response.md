Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It takes in two numbers and returns a tuple where the second number is the first element and the first number is the second element, which matches the expected output. Testing various inputs (e.g., `func_1(3, 5)` should return `(5, 3)`) confirms that the function behaves as specified for all potential cases.
