#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a, where a and b are numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are numbers, and it returns the values of `b` and `a` in that order, effectively swapping their positions. There are no edge cases or missing functionality since the function performs this operation directly and simply.
