The code `n //= 10` performs an integer division of `n` by `10` and assigns the result back to `n`. Since `n` must be greater than `0`, it will become a smaller positive integer.

The initial state states that `total` is equal to `n % 10`, which means that `total` holds the last digit of `n`. After executing `n //= 10`, `n` becomes `n // 10`, and `total` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and now is equal to `n // 10`; `total` is equal to `n % 10`.**
