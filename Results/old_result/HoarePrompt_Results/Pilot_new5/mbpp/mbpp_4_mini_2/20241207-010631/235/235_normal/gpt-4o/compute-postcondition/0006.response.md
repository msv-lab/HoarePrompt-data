The operation `n //= 10` performs an integer division of `n` by `10`, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. Since the initial state states that `n` is greater than or equal to `10`, the value of `n` after this operation will be reduced to a value that is at least `1`.

The value of `total` is dependent on the last digit of the original `n` value (before the division occurs), specifically `total = 2 * (n % 10)`, which remains valid as `total` is not modified by the code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `total` is equal to `2 * (n % 10)`**
