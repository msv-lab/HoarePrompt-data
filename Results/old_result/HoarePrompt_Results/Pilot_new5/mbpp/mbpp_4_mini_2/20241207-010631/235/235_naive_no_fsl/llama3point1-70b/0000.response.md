Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Type**: The problem specifies that the input should be a non-negative integer. The function converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (which represents a digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up.

2. **Handling Non-Negative Integers**: Since the function is designed to work with strings of digits, it correctly handles any non-negative integer input without any issues.

3. **Examples**:
   - For `n = 123`, the digits are `1`, `2`, and `3`, and their sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
   - For `n = 0`, there is only one digit `0`, and the sum is `0`.
   - For `n = 9999`, the digits are `9, 9, 9, 9`, and their sum is `9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases like `0` properly, returning `0`, and it will work for any length of digits as long as they represent a non-negative integer.

Since the function has been examined for potential cases and found to work correctly under the constraints given in the problem description, it is deemed correct.
