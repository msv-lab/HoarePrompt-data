Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.

Here's the reasoning for the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is designed to accept a non-negative integer `n`. The provided assertions confirm that the function is expected to work with such inputs.

2. **Digit Summation Logic**: The algorithm utilizes a `while` loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `n` using the modulo operation (`n % 10`) and add that digit to the `total`. This is the correct approach for summing the digits of an integer.

3. **Reduction of `n`**: After extracting the last digit, the integer `n` is reduced by removing the last digit with integer division (`n //= 10`). This continues until `n` becomes 0, ensuring that all digits are processed.

4. **Final Return Value**: The function returns `total`, which correctly reflects the sum of all digits. If `n` is initially 0, the total remains 0, which is also the expected result in accordance with the problem description.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions provided confirm that the function's outputs for various test cases align with the expected sums of digits:
   - `func_1(345)` returns `12` because `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`.
   - `func_1(12)` returns `3` because `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - `func_1(97)` returns `16` because `9 + 7 = 16`.

Since the function behaves as required by the problem statement and correctly handles the case of `n = 0`, the program is correct and meets the specified requirements.
