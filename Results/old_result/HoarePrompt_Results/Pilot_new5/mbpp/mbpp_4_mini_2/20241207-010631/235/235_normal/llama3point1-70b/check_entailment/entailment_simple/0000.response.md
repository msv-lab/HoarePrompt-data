Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input. Inside the function, it converts the integer `n` to its string representation, iterates over each character (digit) in that string, converts each character back to an integer, and then computes the sum of these integers using the `sum()` function.

Hereâ€™s the reasoning for its correctness:

1. **Input Type**: The function expects `n` to be a non-negative integer, which is stated in the problem description.
2. **Digit Extraction**: The conversion to a string (`str(n)`) allows for easy iteration over each digit of the integer.
3. **Integer Conversion**: Each character (digit) is converted back to an integer with `int(digit)`.
4. **Summation**: The `sum()` function correctly adds up all the individual integer digits, yielding the total sum of the digits of `n`.

Since the function handles the input according to the requirements and correctly computes the desired output for any valid non-negative integer input, it satisfies the problem description. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
