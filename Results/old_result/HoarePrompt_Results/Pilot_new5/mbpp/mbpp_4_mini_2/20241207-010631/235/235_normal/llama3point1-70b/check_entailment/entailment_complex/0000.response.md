Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description, which specifies that the function must get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is designed to accept a non-negative integer `n`, as stated in the annotations before the function call. The comment explicitly states that the state before the function call is that `n` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Digit Extraction**: The function converts the integer `n` into a string with `str(n)`, allowing it to iterate over each digit.

3. **Summation of Digits**: It uses a generator expression to convert each character (digit) back into an integer and sums these integers using the built-in `sum()` function. This correctly calculates the sum of the digits of `n`.

4. **Edge Cases Considered**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0 (the sum of the digits of 0 is 0) and any other non-negative integer without the risk of encountering negative values, as the input constraint is clearly defined.

Since the program accurately fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases of non-negative integers, it is correct.
