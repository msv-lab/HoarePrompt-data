The provided code is as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))
```

The problem description states that the function should return the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.

### Initial Assessment:
- The code converts the non-negative integer `n` into a string to iterate over each digit.
- It converts each character back to an integer and sums them up.
- This approach seems to correctly compute the sum of the digits for any non-negative integer input.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Zero (0)**: The sum of the digits of 0 should return 0, and this is handled correctly.
2. **Single-Digit Numbers (1-9)**: The function will also return the number itself, which is correct.
3. **Multiple-Digit Numbers (e.g., 123)**: The function will sum the digits correctly (1+2+3=6).
4. **Leading Zeros**: Since n is a non-negative integer, leading zeros would only be relevant for strings, not integers.

### Output Hints Assessment:
The output hints state:
- "The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits."
- "It handles any non-negative integer by converting it to a string, iterating through each character, converting them back to integers, and summing those integers."
- "There are no edge cases regarding negative numbers as the input is explicitly stated to be non-negative."

The output hints agree with the code's functionality and clarify that it correctly handles the expected input types and scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. There are no identified edge cases or scenarios where it would fail based on the problem description and output hints.

Correctness: **True**.
