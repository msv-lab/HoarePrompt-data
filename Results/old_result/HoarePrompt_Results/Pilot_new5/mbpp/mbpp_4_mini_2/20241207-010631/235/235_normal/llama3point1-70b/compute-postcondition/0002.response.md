Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It handles any non-negative integer by converting it to a string, iterating through each character, converting them back to integers, and summing those integers. There are no edge cases regarding negative numbers as the input is explicitly stated to be non-negative.**
