Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the input is zero. According to the problem description, it is stated that the function should get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer, which includes zero. 

In the current implementation, if `func_1(0)` is called, the function will return `0`, which is correct in itself, but the assertion for that case is missing in the provided test cases. 

To illustrate the issue: 
- The program lacks an assertion for `func_1(0)` where the expected output should be `0` (since the sum of the digits of 0 is 0). 
- Without this assertion, we cannot confirm that the program handles this edge case correctly.

Thus, since the program does not verify the case of `0` and lacks proper coverage for all potential cases, it is considered incorrect.
