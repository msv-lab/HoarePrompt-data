The `flat_list` is extended by the result of calling `func_1(item)`. Since `item` is currently a list (specifically the first item from `nested_list`), `func_1(item)` will return a flattened version of `item`. The variable `flat_list`, which was initially empty, will now contain the elements returned from `func_1(item)`. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified, and `item` is still the first item in `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 item; `flat_list` now contains the elements returned by `func_1(item)`; `item` remains the first item in `nested_list`, and its value is a list.**
