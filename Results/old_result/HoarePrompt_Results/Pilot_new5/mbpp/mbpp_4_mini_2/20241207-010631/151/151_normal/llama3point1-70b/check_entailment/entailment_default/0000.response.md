To evaluate the provided Python function `func_1` for flattening a nested list structure, we first need to analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description:
The function should flatten a nested list structure that may contain integers, nested lists, or other non-list elements. It should return a single list of all integers and non-list elements from the `nested_list`, preserving their order. If the `nested_list` is empty, it should return an empty list.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list
```

The code iterates through each element in the `nested_list`. If an element is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that element and extends `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it appends it directly to `flat_list`. Finally, it returns `flat_list`.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. An empty list: The function should return an empty list, which it does correctly since `nested_list` will not enter the for loop and `flat_list` will remain empty.
2. A list containing only non-list elements: The function should return that list as is.
3. A deeply nested structure: The function should correctly flatten all levels of nested lists.
4. Non-list elements within lists: The function should handle cases where lists contain non-list elements correctly, which it does.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the function should return all integers and non-list elements, preserving their order, and that it does not handle non-list elements nested within lists differently. This aligns with how the function currently operates, as every non-list element is appended directly to the flattened list.

### Final Assessment:
Looking closely, the function does handle the requirements of the problem description correctly. There are no identified edge cases that would cause it to fail. The output hints also validate that the function's behavior aligns with the problem requirements.

Thus, the function `func_1` correctly flattens nested lists by handling various cases as required.

Correctness: **True**. 

**Explanation**: The function successfully flattens nested lists, returning a single list of all integers and non-list elements while preserving their order. It handles empty lists and deeply nested structures correctly, fulfilling the problem's requirements.
