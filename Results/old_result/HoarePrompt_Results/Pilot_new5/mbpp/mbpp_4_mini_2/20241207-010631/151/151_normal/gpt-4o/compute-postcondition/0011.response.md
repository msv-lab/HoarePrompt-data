According to the code, the loop iterates over each item in `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 2 items, and `item` is the second item in the list, meaning that the loop has already processed the first item. For the loop to execute one more time, the next `item` needs to be the third item in `nested_list`, and `nested_list` must contain at least 3 items for that to occur.

State: **`nested_list` contains at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list.**
