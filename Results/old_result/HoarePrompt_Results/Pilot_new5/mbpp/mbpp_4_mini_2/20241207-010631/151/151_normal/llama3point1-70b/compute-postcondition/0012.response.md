The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` will extend `flat_list` with the result of the function `func_1` applied to `i`. The variable `i` is already known to be the third element of `nested_list`, which has at least 3 elements. We do not know the specific value of `i` or the output of `func_1(i)`, but we know that `flat_list` will have additional elements from the result of `func_1(i)` added to it.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(i)`**.
