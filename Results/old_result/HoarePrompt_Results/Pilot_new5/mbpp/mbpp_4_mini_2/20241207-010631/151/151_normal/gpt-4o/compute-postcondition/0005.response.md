The code appends the value of `item` to the `flat_list`. Since `item` is the first item in `nested_list` and is not a list, it will be added directly to `flat_list`. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged, while `flat_list` now contains one item, which is the same as `item`. 

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 item, `flat_list` contains the item from `nested_list`, `item` is the first item in `nested_list` and is not a list.**
