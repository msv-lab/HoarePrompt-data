Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively checking each item in the input list. If the item is a list, the function calls itself to flatten that list, and then extends the `flat_list` with the flattened result. If the item is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`. 

The assertions included cover various nested list scenarios, and the function produces the expected output for all of them. The function handles multiple levels of nesting, as well as lists containing non-list elements, accurately returning a single flat list without any missing or duplicated elements. 

Since I could not identify any potential cases where the function fails to comply with the problem description, I conclude that the function is correct.
