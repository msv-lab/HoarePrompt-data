The variable `flat_list` is modified by extending it with the result of `func_1(i)`. The value of `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, which means that the output will depend on the specific operation defined in `func_1` when applied to `i`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`**
