Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters, `d` (a dictionary) and `n` (an integer), which aligns with the inputs specified in the problem description.

2. **Dictionary Comprehension**: The function uses dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary. This mechanism iterates through the items in the input dictionary `d` and checks if each value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

3. **Filtering Logic**: The filtering condition `if v >= n` ensures that only key-value pairs where the value meets the specified condition are included in the output dictionary. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

4. **Return Value**: The function correctly returns a new dictionary containing only the entries that meet the criteria, or an empty dictionary if no entries do. This behavior is consistent with the requirements.

5. **Behavior on Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input dictionary is empty (it will return an empty dictionary) or when no values in the dictionary meet the condition (it will also return an empty dictionary).

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, thus confirming its correctness.
