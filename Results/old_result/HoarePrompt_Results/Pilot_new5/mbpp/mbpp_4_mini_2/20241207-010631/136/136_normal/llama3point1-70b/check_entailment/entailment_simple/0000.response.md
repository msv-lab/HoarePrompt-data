Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the specifications:

1. **Input Types**: The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d`, which is expected to have integer values, and an integer `n`.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The program uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary. It iterates over each key-value pair in the input dictionary `d` and includes only those pairs where the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new dictionary containing only the entries that satisfy the condition, thus filtering the original dictionary to meet the specific criteria.

4. **General Case Handling**: The logic correctly handles all cases, including:
   - If all values in the dictionary are less than `n`, it will return an empty dictionary.
   - If some values are equal to `n`, those entries will be included in the result.
   - If there are no entries in the dictionary, it will also return an empty dictionary.

Overall, since the function consistently filters the dictionary according to the specified criteria (values greater than or equal to `n`), it fulfills the problem description accurately in all potential scenarios.
