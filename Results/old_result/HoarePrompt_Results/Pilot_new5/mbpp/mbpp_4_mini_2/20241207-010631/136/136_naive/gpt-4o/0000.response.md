Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly filters the dictionary entries based on the given integer `n`. It utilizes a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The assertions provided also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, confirming its correctness. 

For example:
- For the first assertion, with `n = 170`, it correctly includes `'Cierra Vega'`, `'Alden Cantrell'`, and `'Pierre Cox'` since their values (175, 180, 190) are greater than or equal to 170.
- For the second assertion, with `n = 180`, it includes `'Alden Cantrell'` and `'Pierre Cox'`, as their values are equal to or greater than 180.
- For the third assertion, with `n = 190`, it includes only `'Pierre Cox'` since its value is exactly 190.

All potential cases have been taken into consideration, and the program accurately meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
