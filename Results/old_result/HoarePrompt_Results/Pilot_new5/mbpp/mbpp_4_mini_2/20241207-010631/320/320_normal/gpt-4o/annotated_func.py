#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #The program returns the second unique element from the sorted list `unique_nums`, since `nums` contains at least two distinct elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` which is guaranteed to contain at least two distinct elements. It returns the second smallest unique integer from the list. If there are not enough unique elements (which theoretically shouldn't happen due to the precondition), it would return None. However, based on the implementation, it reliably returns the second unique number when there are at least two distinct integers.
