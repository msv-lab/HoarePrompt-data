The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers that contains at least two distinct elements. After executing the function body, it returns the second unique element from the sorted list `unique_nums`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return the second unique element from that list after sorting it. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nums, which is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, and returns the second unique element from the sorted list of those integers.**
