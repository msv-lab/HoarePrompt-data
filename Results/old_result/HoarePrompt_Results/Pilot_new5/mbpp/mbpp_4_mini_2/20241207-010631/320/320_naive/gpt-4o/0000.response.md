Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. It first converts the input list into a set to remove duplicates, sorts the unique numbers, and then checks if there are at least two unique numbers. If so, it returns the second smallest; otherwise, it returns `None`. 

The provided assertions also cover various cases:
- The first assertion checks a mix of positive and negative numbers and returns the expected second smallest number, `-2`.
- The second assertion tests a case with duplicates and returns `-0.5`, which is correct.
- The third and fourth assertions confirm that when all elements are the same, the function returns `None`, which is the expected behavior.

All edge cases have been considered, and the function behaves as described in the problem statement.
