The variable `unique_nums` is assigned the value of `sorted(set(nums))`. Here, `set(nums)` removes any duplicate values from the list `nums`, and then `sorted()` arranges the unique numbers in ascending order. Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` will be a sorted list of those distinct elements. The state of `nums` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a sorted list of the unique elements from `nums`.**
