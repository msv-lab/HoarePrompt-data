Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the second smallest number in a list. The issues are as follows:

1. **Handling of Non-Distinct Elements**: The program returns `None` when there are not at least two distinct elements in the list. According to the problem description, it should find the second smallest number, so it should handle cases with duplicates by still providing a second smallest value if it exists.

2. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases include scenarios where there are not two distinct numbers:
   - `func_1([2, 2])` returns `None`, which is incorrect since there is no second smallest number to return.
   - `func_1([2, 2, 2])` also returns `None`, which is similarly incorrect for the same reason.
   
3. **Assumption in Assertion**: The assertion in the comments states that "nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements," which contradicts the validity of the function in general cases where the list does not meet this assumption. 

In conclusion, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements in all cases, particularly when there aren't two distinct elements present. Hence, it does not always return the second smallest number as required.
