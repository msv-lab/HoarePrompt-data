Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list contains fewer than two unique numbers correctly. Specifically, the following test case fails:

- For the input `func_1([2, 2])`, the expected output is `None`, which is correctly returned. However, if the input is `func_1([2])`, or `func_1([])`, the program would throw an `IndexError` due to trying to access `unique_nums[1]` when `unique_nums` has fewer than 2 elements.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement of finding the second smallest number in every potential case, leading to an incorrect result for some inputs.
