To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the function's behavior.

### Problem Description
The function is supposed to find the second smallest number in a list of integers.

### Program Analysis
```python
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
```

1. **Creating Unique Values**: The program converts the input list `nums` into a set to remove duplicates, then sorts this set to create a sorted list of unique numbers.
2. **Return Value**: The function is supposed to return the second smallest unique number if there are at least two unique numbers; otherwise, it returns `None`.

### Initial Assessment Against Description
- The function seems to follow the problem description correctly by identifying the second smallest number among unique numbers.
- However, the code has a limitation: if the input list contains only one unique number or all numbers are the same, the program will return `None`.

### Edge Cases to Consider
- **All Elements Are the Same**: If the input list contains the same number multiple times, like `[2, 2]` or `[3, 3, 3]`, it will return `None`, which is expected, but this case should be documented as part of the edge case analysis.
- **Two Distinct Numbers**: In cases like `[1, 2]`, it should return `2`, which it does correctly.
- **Negative and Positive Mix**: A case like `[-1, 0, 1]` should return `0`, and the logic works as expected.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function is guaranteed to contain at least two distinct elements, thus implying that the function will not encounter scenarios where it needs to return `None`. However, the implementation does include a check for this scenario which is technically correct, but the hints present a contradiction.

### Conclusion
The implementation correctly identifies the second smallest unique number in cases where this is possible. However, since the problem statement does not guarantee that input lists contain at least two distinct elements (despite the hints suggesting this), there exist valid input cases (like `[2, 2]` or `[2, 2, 2]`) that result in `None` being returned, which is not in line with the expectation set by the problem description that should return a valid second smallest number.

Therefore, this discrepancy leads me to conclude that while the function is logically sound for many inputs, it does not adhere strictly to the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 
The function does not work correctly for inputs that contain only one unique number, which results in an unexpected `None`.
