You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None as the return statement explicitly specifies this value regardless of the state of `unique_nums`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a list containing the unique integers from `nums`. The length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`, which is obtained by sorting `unique_nums` and accessing the second element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two elements and returns None if all elements in `nums` are the same, or the second smallest unique integer from `nums` if applicable. If there are fewer than two unique integers in the list, it returns None. If there are at least two unique integers, it sorts the unique values and returns the second smallest element.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
