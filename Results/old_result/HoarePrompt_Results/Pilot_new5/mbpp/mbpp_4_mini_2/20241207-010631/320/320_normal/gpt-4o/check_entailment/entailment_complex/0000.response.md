Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's a breakdown of why the implementation is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input. The annotations state that the list is guaranteed to contain at least two distinct elements, which aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Finding Unique Elements**: The function uses `set(nums)` to remove duplicate values from the list. This ensures that we only consider unique numbers when determining the second smallest value.

3. **Sorting**: The unique elements are sorted using `sorted(set(nums))`. This allows for an ordered arrangement of the numbers, making it straightforward to identify the second smallest number.

4. **Returning the Second Smallest**: The function checks if there is more than one unique number (`len(unique_nums) > 1`). If this condition is met, it accesses the second element of the sorted list (`unique_nums[1]`), which is guaranteed to be the second smallest number. If there is only one unique number, it returns `None`, although the precondition assures that there will be at least two distinct elements.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program cover various scenarios:
   - Different integers and negative numbers are correctly handled.
   - Lists with duplicate values return the expected second smallest value.
   - The function returns `None` for cases where all numbers are the same, which, while theoretically outside the problem constraints, is a graceful handling of the situation.

Overall, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description and handles the scenario as specified, ensuring correctness across the provided test cases.
