Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string. If the first character `char` of `expr` is in the values of `matching_pairs`, then `stack` contains `char`. Otherwise, `char` is not a value in `matching_pairs`, and if it is present in `matching_pairs`, the top element of `stack` matches the value of `matching_pairs[char]`, indicating that `char` is successfully matched with the last added element from `stack` after popping.***
