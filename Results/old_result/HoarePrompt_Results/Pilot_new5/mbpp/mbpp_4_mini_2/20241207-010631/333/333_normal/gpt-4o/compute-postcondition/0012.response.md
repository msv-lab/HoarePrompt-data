According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `expr`. The loop iterates over each character in `expr`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `expr` is a non-empty string. The character `char` can either be a value from `matching_pairs`, in which case it would be added to `stack`, or it can be a character that is not a value in `matching_pairs`, in which case it should match with the top element of `stack`.

Since the loop processes each character of `expr`, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in `expr`. If there are more characters remaining in `expr`, then `char` will be the next character, and the loop will continue.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string that must have at least one more character remaining, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` remains unchanged**
