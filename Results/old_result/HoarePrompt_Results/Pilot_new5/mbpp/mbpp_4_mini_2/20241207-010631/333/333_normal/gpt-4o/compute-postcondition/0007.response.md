Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of `expr`, `char` is not a value in the `matching_pairs` dictionary, and the current value of `char` is in `matching_pairs`. The `stack` is empty or the last element popped from `stack` does not match the corresponding value in `matching_pairs` for `char`.***
