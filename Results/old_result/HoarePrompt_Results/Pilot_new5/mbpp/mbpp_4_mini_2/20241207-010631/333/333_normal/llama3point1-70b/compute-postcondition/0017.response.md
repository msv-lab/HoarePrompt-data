Postcondition: ***`stack` is an empty list, `expression` is a non-empty string, and `char` is the second character of `expression`. If `char` is in `brackets`, then if `stack` is empty or the popped character from `stack` does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping, the function returns False. If `char` is not in `brackets`, the `stack` remains unchanged, and execution continues.***
