You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string that may contain various types of parentheses (such as '()', '{}', '[]') and other characters.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expr` is a string that has been fully processed, `stack` is empty if all parentheses are properly matched, otherwise it contains unmatched opening parentheses, and the function returns True if all parentheses are matched and False if they are not.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if all parentheses in the string 'expr' are matched and False if they are not, based on whether 'stack' is empty or contains unmatched opening parentheses.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` and checks for properly matched parentheses, including '()', '{}', and '[]'. It returns True if all parentheses are matched and properly closed; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle or return any error for unmatched parentheses, and it assumes that the input string only contains parentheses and other characters without any other validation.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
