The code initializes a dictionary called `matching_pairs`, which maps closing parentheses to their corresponding opening parentheses. The state of the variables `expr` and `stack` remains unchanged as the code only creates a new dictionary.

Output State: **`expr` is a string that may contain various types of parentheses (such as '()', '{}', '[]') and other characters; `stack` is an empty list; `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
