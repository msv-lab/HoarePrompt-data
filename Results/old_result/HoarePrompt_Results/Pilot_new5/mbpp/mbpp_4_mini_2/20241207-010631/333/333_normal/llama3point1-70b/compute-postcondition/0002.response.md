According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expression`. If `expression` is a non-empty string, the loop will iterate over its characters. Since `stack` is an empty list, it is appropriate for it to start as such. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `expression` must be a non-empty string, and `char` will be the first character of the `expression`.

State: **`stack` is an empty list, `expression` must be a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of the expression**
