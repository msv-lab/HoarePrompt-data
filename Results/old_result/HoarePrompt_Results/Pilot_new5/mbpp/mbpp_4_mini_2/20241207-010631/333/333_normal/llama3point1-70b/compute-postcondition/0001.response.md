The variable `brackets` is assigned a dictionary mapping opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` is a string that may contain various types of brackets (e.g., '()', '{}', '[]') and any other characters, `stack` is an empty list, and `brackets` is a dictionary `{'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}`.
