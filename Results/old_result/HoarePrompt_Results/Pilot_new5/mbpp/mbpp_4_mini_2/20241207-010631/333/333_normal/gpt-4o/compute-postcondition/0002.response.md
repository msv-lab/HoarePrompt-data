According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `expr`. The only requirement for the loop to execute is that `expr` must be a non-empty string; otherwise, the loop will not run even once. The `stack` variable, which starts as an empty list, will store the opening parentheses encountered during the loop's execution. 

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `expr` is not empty. The loop will start with the first character of `expr`.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of `expr`**
