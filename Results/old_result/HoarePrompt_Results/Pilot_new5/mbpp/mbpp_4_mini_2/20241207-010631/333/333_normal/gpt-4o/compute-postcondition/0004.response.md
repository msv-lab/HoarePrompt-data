The code `stack.append(char)` adds the current value of `char` to the `stack` list. Since `char` is the first character of `expr` and is confirmed to be in the `matching_pairs`, the `stack` will now contain that character. The initial state indicates that `stack` is empty before this operation.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` contains the first character of `expr`, `char` is the first character of `expr` which is in the values of `matching_pairs.**
