Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to check if a given expression containing various types of parentheses (such as '()', '{}', '[]') is balanced.

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Stack Usage**: The program utilizes a stack, which is an appropriate data structure for managing opening and closing parentheses. The stack allows the program to keep track of the most recent unmatched opening parentheses.

2. **Matching Pairs**: The dictionary `matching_pairs` correctly maps each closing parenthesis to its corresponding opening parenthesis. This enables the program to check for matches when encountering a closing parenthesis.

3. **Logic Flow**:
   - For each character in the expression, the program checks if it is an opening parenthesis (which is added to the stack) or a closing parenthesis (which checks for a match with the top of the stack).
   - If a closing parenthesis is encountered and the stack is empty (indicating that there was no corresponding opening parenthesis) or if the top of the stack does not match the expected opening parenthesis, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - After processing all characters in the expression, if the stack is empty, it indicates that all opening parentheses were matched by closing ones, and the function returns `True`.

4. **Handling of Other Characters**: The program correctly ignores characters that are not parentheses, ensuring that the balancing check is only concerned with parentheses.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions test various scenarios:
   - The first assertion `func_1('{()}[{}]')` returns `True`, indicating that this expression is balanced.
   - The second assertion `func_1('{()}[{]')` returns `False`, as there is an unmatched opening bracket.
   - The third assertion `func_1('{()}[{}][]({})')` returns `True`, confirming that this expression is also balanced.
   
Overall, the program accurately checks for balanced parentheses according to the specifications outlined in the problem description, and it performs correctly across the provided test cases.
