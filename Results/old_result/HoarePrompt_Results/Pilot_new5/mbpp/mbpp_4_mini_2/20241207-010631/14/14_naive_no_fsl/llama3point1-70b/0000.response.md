Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine if there are duplicate elements in the array by comparing the length of the array with the length of the set created from that array. However, the logic is inverted. The correct logic should return `True` if duplicates are found (i.e., the lengths are different) and `False` otherwise.

For example:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` should return `False` (no duplicates).
- Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3]` should return `True` (there is a duplicate).

The program currently returns `True` for arrays without duplicates and `False` for arrays with duplicates. This is incorrect based on the problem description. 

Therefore, since it fails in at least one case (and indeed has flawed logic overall), the correctness of the program is **False**.
