Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns True if there are duplicate integers in the list; otherwise, it returns False. It effectively checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the original list with the length of a set created from that list, which removes duplicates. It handles empty lists correctly, returning False when there are no elements. **
