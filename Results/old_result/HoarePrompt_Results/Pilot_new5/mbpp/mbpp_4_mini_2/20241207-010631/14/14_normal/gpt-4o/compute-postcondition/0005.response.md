The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. Since `num` is the first integer in `arr` and is not in `seen`, after executing the code, `seen` will contain the value of `num`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that has at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `arr`, `seen` is a set containing `num`.**
