Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists in a case-insensitive manner using `str.lower` as the sorting key. This implementation correctly fulfills the problem description. 

The function handles various potential cases well:
- It sorts strings of mixed cases (e.g., "banana", "Apple", "cherry") correctly.
- It successfully handles empty sublists (e.g., [[], ["apple", "Banana"]]) by returning the same empty sublist for sorting.
- The function also works with a list of empty strings (e.g., [["", ""]]) by sorting them, which remains unchanged.

Since I cannot identify any potential case where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
