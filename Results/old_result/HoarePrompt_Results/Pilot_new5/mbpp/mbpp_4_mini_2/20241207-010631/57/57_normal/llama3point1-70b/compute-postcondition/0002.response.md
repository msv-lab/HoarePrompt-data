Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings, and returns a new list of lists with each sublist sorted in a case-insensitive manner. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-string elements, but it will still process them without error. If empty sublists are present, they will remain empty in the output.**
