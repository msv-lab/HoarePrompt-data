To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to examine if it accurately sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists according to the problem description.

The program uses the following logic:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

This function takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input, and for each sublist, it sorts the strings using `sorted()` with a key of `str.lower`. This means it sorts the strings in a case-insensitive manner.

Let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **Empty Input**: If the input is an empty list (`[]`), the output should also be an empty list (`[]`). The program handles this correctly.
2. **Empty Sublists**: If there are empty sublists (e.g., `[[], []]`), the output should also contain empty sublists (`[[], []]`). The program also handles this correctly.
3. **Single Element Sublists**: If a sublist contains only one element (e.g., `[["apple"], ["Banana"]]`), the output should be the same as the input since there is nothing to sort. The program handles this correctly.
4. **Mixed Case Strings**: If a sublist contains mixed-case strings (e.g., `[["banana", "Apple", "cherry"]]`), the sorting should correctly result in `["Apple", "banana", "cherry"]`. The program handles this correctly.
5. **Non-string Elements**: If a sublist contains non-string elements (e.g., `[["banana", 1, "Apple"]]`), this would raise a `TypeError` due to the `str.lower` key function trying to apply to a non-string type. The program does not handle this case correctly.

Since there exists at least one potential case (non-string elements in the sublist) where the program does not perform as expected (it raises an error instead of handling it gracefully), we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
