Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. While the function `func_1` sorts the sublists of strings correctly, there is a significant issue regarding input validation. The function assumes that all elements in `list_of_lists` are indeed sublists containing strings. 

If `list_of_lists` contains any element that is not a list, or any sublist that contains non-string elements (for example, integers or `None`), the `sorted` function will raise a `TypeError`. This failure to handle unexpected input types means that the function does not robustly fulfill the problem description, which implies that it should sort the sublists of strings without encountering errors.

Thus, the program is not correct as it does not handle all possible input scenarios as required by the problem statement.
