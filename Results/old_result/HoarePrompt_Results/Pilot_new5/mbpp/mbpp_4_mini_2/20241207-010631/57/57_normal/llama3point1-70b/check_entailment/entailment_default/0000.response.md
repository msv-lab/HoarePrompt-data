To assess the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code first.

### Problem description:
The function is supposed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.

### Code:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

### Analysis:
1. The code iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists` and sorts it in a case-insensitive manner using `key=str.lower`.
2. If a sublist is empty, `sorted` will return an empty list, and this behavior is consistent with the requirement.
3. The code does not explicitly handle cases where the input list is empty or where non-string elements may be present. However, the output hints suggest that it will still process them without error, meaning the code does not crash or raise exceptions.

### Output hints:
- The function accepts a list of lists with strings and returns a new list of lists with each sublist sorted in a case-insensitive manner.
- The function does not handle empty input lists or non-string elements specifically but will not fail on these cases.
- Empty sublists remain empty in the output.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Input List**: If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function should return `[]`. This is handled correctly by the list comprehension, which would yield an empty list.
2. **Non-string Elements**: If `list_of_lists` contains elements that are not strings (e.g., integers, None, etc.), the sorting would still proceed without raising an error but could lead to unexpected results. For example, if a list contains `[1, 'apple', 'Banana']`, the code would attempt to sort and may not behave as expected since integers do not have a defined order with strings during sorting.
3. **Mixed Case Strings**: Sorting should work correctly for mixed case strings as `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` is specified.

### Conclusion:
The code meets the requirements for sorting the strings in a case-insensitive manner but does not appropriately handle non-string elements, which could lead to unpredictable sorting behavior.

Given that the program does not conform to the problem description for every potential case due to the lack of handling for non-string elements, the correctness assessment is as follows:

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code does not account for cases where non-string elements are present in the input list of lists, leading to potential incorrect or unexpected behavior. For example, passing a sublist like `[1, 'apple']` would not yield a valid sorted list of strings.
