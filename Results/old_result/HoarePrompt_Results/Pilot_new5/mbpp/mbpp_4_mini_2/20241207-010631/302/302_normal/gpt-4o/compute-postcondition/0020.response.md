Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers and `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, while `high` remains unchanged, and `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, while `low` remains unchanged, and `mid` is also recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`***.
