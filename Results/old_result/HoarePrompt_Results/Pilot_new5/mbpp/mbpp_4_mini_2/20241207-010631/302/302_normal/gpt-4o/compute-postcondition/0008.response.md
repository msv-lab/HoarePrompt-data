Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1, result is -1, mid is equal to (0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2, and arr[mid] is not equal to target. The current value of `mid` points to an element in `arr` that is less than `target`, indicating that all elements left of `mid` (including `arr[mid]`) are also less than `target`.***
