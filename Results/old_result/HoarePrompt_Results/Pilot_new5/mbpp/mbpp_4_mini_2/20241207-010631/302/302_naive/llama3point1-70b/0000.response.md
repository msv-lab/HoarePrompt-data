Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number appears multiple times in the sorted array. According to the problem description, it is required to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number, but the program iterates through the entire array and returns the index of the first match it encounters. 

For example, if the input is `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 2`, the expected output is `1`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `2`. However, if the input were `arr = []` (an empty array) and `num = 2`, the program would correctly return `-1` as expected. However, the case that breaks it is when `num` is not present at all; for example, `arr = [1, 2, 3]` and `num = 4`, which would return `-1` as expected.

The implementation does not take into account that the array is sorted and could use a binary search approach for efficiency. 

Therefore, since it does not follow the description accurately for every potential case, the output is **False**.
