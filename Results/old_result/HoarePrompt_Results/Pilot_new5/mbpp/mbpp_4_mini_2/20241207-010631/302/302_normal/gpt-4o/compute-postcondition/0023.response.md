The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The variables `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged in this operation. The output state reflects the new value of `mid`, derived from the existing values of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2**
