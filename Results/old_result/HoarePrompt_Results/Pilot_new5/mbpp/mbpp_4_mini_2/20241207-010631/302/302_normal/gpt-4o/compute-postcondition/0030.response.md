Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `result` is the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists in `arr`, or -1 if `target` does not exist in `arr`. If `target` is greater than the largest element in `arr`, then `low` will have become `len(arr)`, and `high` will be less than `len(arr) - 1`. If `target` is less than the smallest element in `arr`, then `low` will still be 0 and `high` will be -1 indicating that `target` is not present. If `target` is found, `result` will hold the index of its last occurrence.**
