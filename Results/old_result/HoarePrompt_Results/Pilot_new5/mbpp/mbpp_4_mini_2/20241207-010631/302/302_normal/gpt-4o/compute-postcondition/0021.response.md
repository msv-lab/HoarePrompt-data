Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, and `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, then `result` is equal to `mid`, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `mid` is recalculated accordingly, while `high` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `mid` is recalculated, while `low` remains unchanged.***
