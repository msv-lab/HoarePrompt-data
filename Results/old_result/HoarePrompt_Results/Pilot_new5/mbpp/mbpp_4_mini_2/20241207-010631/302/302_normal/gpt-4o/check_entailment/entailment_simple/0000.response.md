The provided program is intended to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, upon examining the implementation, we can see that the function `func_1` actually returns the index of the last occurrence of the target number, not the first.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The program initializes `result` to -1, which is meant to indicate that the target number has not yet been found.
2. When the target is found at index `mid`, the program updates `result` with `mid` and continues searching to the left by updating `high` to `mid - 1`. This effectively allows the search for the first occurrence but only returns the last index found since it doesn't continue to store the first occurrence.
3. The final value returned is stored in `result`, which only ever stores the last index where the target was found, rather than the first.

Thus, when you run tests like `assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`, it returns `1`, which is actually the index of the first occurrence of `5`. However, in cases where the target is not found, or in more complex scenarios, it is likely that the function will not yield the correct index for the first occurrence.

### Example case where it fails:
If we consider the input `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`, it returns `1`, which coincidentally is the correct first index. However, if the first occurrence was at a later index, or if the elements were arranged differently, the function would still return the last occurrence.

Given that the function does not adhere strictly to the requirement of finding the first occurrence, but instead finds the last occurrence, it fails to meet the problem description fully.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
