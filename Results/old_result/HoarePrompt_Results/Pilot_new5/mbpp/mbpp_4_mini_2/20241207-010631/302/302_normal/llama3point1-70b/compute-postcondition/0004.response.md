According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr` and the variable `i`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer in the list, and `x` is not equal to `num`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so it will become 1. The loop can execute again as long as `arr` has at least 2 integers. Thus, after this increment, `x` will be the second integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer in the list**
