The value of `high` is updated to be `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` is a specific calculation based on the values of `low` and `high`, which means `high` will now be one less than that specific value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `result` is equal to `mid`, and `high` is now equal to `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `result` is equal to `mid`, and `high` is equal to `mid - 1`**.
