Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is greater than `mid` and less than or equal to `high`, with `mid` recalculated as (low + high) // 2. Otherwise, `low` remains less than or equal to `high`, with `high` updated to `mid - 1`, and `mid` recalculated as (low + high) // 2.***
