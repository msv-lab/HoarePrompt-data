The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is equal to `(0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2`, we can express `high` in terms of `len(arr)` as `high = ((0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2) - 1`. The other variables (`arr`, `target`, `low`, `result`, and `mid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to ((0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2) - 1, `result` is equal to mid, `mid` is equal to (0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2, and the value at index mid of arr is equal to `target`.**
