`result` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. Since no specific values for `low` and `high` are provided, `mid` remains an expression equal to `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high, mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2, `result` is equal to `(low + high) // 2.**
