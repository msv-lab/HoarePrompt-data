According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop can execute again as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `low` and `high` must satisfy the condition `low <= high`, and we know that `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target` after the last evaluation, we can infer that the current state must ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `high`. 

If `low` is equal to `high`, the loop can execute one more time, but if `low` was updated to be greater than `high`, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `low` is adjusted properly to ensure it remains less than or equal to `high`. 

Assuming `low` has not changed from the last iteration, we need to check if `high` is still greater than or equal to the current value of `low`. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
