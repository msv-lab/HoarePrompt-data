The variable `result` is assigned a value of `-1`. The other variables `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is updated to reflect that `result` is now `-1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1, result is -1**.
