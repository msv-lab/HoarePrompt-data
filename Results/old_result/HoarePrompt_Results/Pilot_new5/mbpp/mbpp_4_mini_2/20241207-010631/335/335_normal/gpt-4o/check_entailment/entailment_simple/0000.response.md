Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function should find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string and return None if there is no match. However, the function `func_1` only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its start and end positions, but it does not account for the possibility of multiple occurrences of the substring in the main string. 

Here are the issues with the implementation:

1. **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: The function only finds the first occurrence of the substring using `find`, which means if there are multiple occurrences of the substring, it will not return all of them. The requirement to "find the occurrence and position of the substrings" implies that it should return all occurrences, not just the first one.

2. **Inconsistent Output for Non-Matches**: The implementation correctly returns `None` if there is no match, which is aligned with the problem description. However, it doesn't specify how multiple occurrences should be returned, which leads to ambiguity in meeting the problem's requirement.

Thus, because the function does not cover the requirement of identifying all occurrences of the substring, it fails to meet the problem description in its entirety.
