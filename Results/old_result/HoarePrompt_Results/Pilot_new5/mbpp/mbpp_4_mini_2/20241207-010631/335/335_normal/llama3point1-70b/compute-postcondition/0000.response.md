The value of `start` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `substring` within `string`. Since both `string` and `substring` are non-empty, `start` will either be a non-negative integer (indicating the position of the first occurrence) or -1 (if `substring` is not found in `string`). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, and `start` is either a non-negative integer (the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`) or -1.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is either a non-negative integer or -1.**
