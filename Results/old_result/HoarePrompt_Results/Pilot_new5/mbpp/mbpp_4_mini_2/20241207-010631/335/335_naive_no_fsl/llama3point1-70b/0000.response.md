Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the substring occurs multiple times within the string. According to the problem description, it is expected to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. The provided implementation only finds the first occurrence and returns its position, ignoring any subsequent occurrences.

For example, if we call `func_1("hello hello", "hello")`, the function will only return the position of the first "hello" and not provide any information about the second occurrence. Thus, it does not meet the requirement of finding all occurrences and their positions.

Therefore, since the program does not work as expected in this case, the correctness is **False**.
