Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The function is supposed to find all occurrences and their respective positions of a substring within a string, but the program only finds the first occurrence. 

Specifically:
1. The method used (`string.find(substring)`) returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is not found, it correctly returns `None`, which aligns with the requirement to return `None` when there is no match.
2. However, the program does not handle multiple occurrences of the substring, as it only returns details about the first occurrence (if found). It fails to provide information about subsequent occurrences or to return a complete list of all occurrences and their positions.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem description's requirement to find all occurrences and positions of the substring, which is necessary for the program to be considered correct.
