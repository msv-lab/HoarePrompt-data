The function accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns True if all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle the case of an empty string correctly, as it only checks if `s` is not empty at the start and doesn't return a value for that case. If `s` is empty, it does not return True as stated in the annotations.
