You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('python') == False
assert func_1('aaa') == True
assert func_1('data') == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string with a length greater than 0.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the string 's' is not empty and has a length greater than 0.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string with a length greater than 0, and `s` is not an empty string.
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string where all characters are the same as `first_char`, implying that `first_char` is equal to every character in `s`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the string 's' consists entirely of the same character, which is 'first_char'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns True if all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle the case of an empty string correctly, as it only checks if `s` is not empty at the start and doesn't return a value for that case. If `s` is empty, it does not return True as stated in the annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
