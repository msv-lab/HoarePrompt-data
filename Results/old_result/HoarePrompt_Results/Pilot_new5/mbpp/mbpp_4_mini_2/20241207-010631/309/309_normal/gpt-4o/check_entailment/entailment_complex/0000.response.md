The program is not correct according to the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The problem description requires a function that checks whether all the characters in a string are the same or not. However, the implementation incorrectly handles the case of an empty string. According to the annotations, if the string `s` is empty, the function does not return a value, which is not defined behavior in Python. Instead, the function is supposed to return `False` for an empty string since it cannot have all characters the same.

2. Specifically, the first conditional check `if (not s): return True` is incorrect. This statement implies that if `s` is empty, the function would return `True`, which contradicts the requirement to check if all characters are the same, as an empty string should not be considered to have all characters the same.

3. The assertion `assert func_1('python') == False` and others show the intended behavior, but the implementation will fail if an empty string is passed, which is not adequately handled by the program. 

Therefore, since the function does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly the empty string case, it does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.
