Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is supposed to check whether all characters in the string are the same or not. However, it returns `True` for an empty string (`''`), as indicated by the line `if not s: return True`. This is not consistent with the problem description, which implies that if there are no characters in the string, it shouldn't be considered as having all same characters. 

For example:
- An empty string `''` should logically return `False`, as there are no characters to compare.
Thus, the function does not correctly handle the case of an empty string, making it incorrect.
