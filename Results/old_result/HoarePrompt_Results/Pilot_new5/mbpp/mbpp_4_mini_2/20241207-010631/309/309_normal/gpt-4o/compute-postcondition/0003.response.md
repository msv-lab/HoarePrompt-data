The variable `first_char` is assigned the value of the first character of the string `s`, which is represented by `s[0]`. The length of `s` is greater than 0, ensuring that `s[0]` is a valid operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string with a length greater than 0, `first_char` is the first character of `s`**.
