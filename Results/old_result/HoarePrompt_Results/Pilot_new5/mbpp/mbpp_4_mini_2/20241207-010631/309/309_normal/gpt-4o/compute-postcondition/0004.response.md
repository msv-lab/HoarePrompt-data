According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. Since `s` is a string with a length greater than 0, it will have at least one character for the loop to iterate over. The loop will start with `char` being the first character of `s`, which is already stated as `first_char`. There are no additional adjustments needed for the loop to execute. 

State: **`s` is a string with a length greater than 0, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is `first_char`**
