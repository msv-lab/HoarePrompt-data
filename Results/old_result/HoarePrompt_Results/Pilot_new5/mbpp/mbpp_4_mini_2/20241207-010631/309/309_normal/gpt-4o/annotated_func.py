#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string with a length greater than 0.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the string 's' is not empty and has a length greater than 0.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string with a length greater than 0, and `s` is not an empty string.
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string where all characters are the same as `first_char`, implying that `first_char` is equal to every character in `s`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the string 's' consists entirely of the same character, which is 'first_char'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` and returns True if all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle the case of an empty string correctly, as it only checks if `s` is not empty at the start and doesn't return a value for that case. If `s` is empty, it does not return True as stated in the annotations.
