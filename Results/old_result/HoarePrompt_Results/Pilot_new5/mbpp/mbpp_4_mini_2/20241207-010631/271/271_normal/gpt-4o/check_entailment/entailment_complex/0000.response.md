The provided program is designed to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from a tuple of tuples. Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

1. **Input Structure**: 
   The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples, which aligns with the problem description. Each inner tuple contains numeric values.

2. **Loop through Elements**:
   The program first determines the number of elements in the first inner tuple (`num_elements`), which is essential for understanding how many averages need to be calculated. It then iterates through each index `i` of the tuples.

3. **Extracting Values**:
   For each index `i`, it constructs a list `elements_at_position` that collects the values from all inner tuples at that position. This is done using a list comprehension, which is efficient and concise.

4. **Calculating Averages**:
   The program calculates the average of these collected values using `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, which is the correct way to compute an average. It appends this value to the `averages` list.

5. **Returning Results**:
   Finally, the function returns the `averages` list, which contains the average values for each position across all inner tuples.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   The problem description does not specify the handling of empty tuples or tuples of different lengths. The program assumes that all inner tuples are of the same length. If any inner tuple is empty or if there are no inner tuples, the program would lead to a division by zero error, which is a significant issue not handled in the code.

Considering this, while the program does perform the averaging correctly for valid input, it does not account for potential edge cases where the tuples might be empty or inconsistently sized. Therefore, it does not fully meet the problem description's implied robustness requirements. 

Thus, the program is not correct for every potential case as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
