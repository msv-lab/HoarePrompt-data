The function accepts a tuple of tuples (`tuples`), where each inner tuple contains numeric values. It returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated by summing the corresponding elements of the inner tuples and dividing by the number of inner tuples. If `tuples` is empty, it will return an empty list as there are no elements to average.
