The code assigns `elements_at_position` the values of the second elements (index 1) of each inner tuple in `tuples`. Since `num_elements` is greater than 1, it guarantees that there are at least two elements in each inner tuple, and therefore `t[i]` is valid for `i = 1`. The values of `elements_at_position` will now be determined by the second elements of each inner tuple. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, `averages` now includes `avg`.**
