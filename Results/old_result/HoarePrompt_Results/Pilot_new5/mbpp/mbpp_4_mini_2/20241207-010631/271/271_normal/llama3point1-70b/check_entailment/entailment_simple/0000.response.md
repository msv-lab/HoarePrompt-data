Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples. This aligns with the problem description stating that the input should be a tuple of tuples.

2. **Computing Averages**: The computation of averages is correctly implemented. The program utilizes the `zip(*tuples)` function to group the corresponding elements of the inner tuples together. For example, if the input `tuples` were `((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))`, `zip(*tuples)` would produce an iterable of pairs: `((1, 3, 5), (2, 4, 6))`.

3. **Sum and Length Calculation**: The program then calculates the average for each group of values by summing them (`sum(val)`) and dividing by the number of inner tuples (`len(tuples)`). This ensures that the average for each position is derived from all tuples at that position.

4. **Output Format**: The result is returned as a list, which is the expected output format according to the problem description.

In summary, the program accurately computes the average of corresponding values from each tuple, as required, and does so for any valid input that adheres to the specified structure. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
