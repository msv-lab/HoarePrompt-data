The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values, and it is ensured that there is at least one non-empty inner tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns a list called 'averages', which contains the average values of each position across all inner tuples in 'tuples'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and return a list of average values calculated from these tuples.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples, which is a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, and returns a list of average values for each position across all inner tuples.**
