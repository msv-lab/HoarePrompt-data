To analyze the provided program against the problem description, letâ€™s consider the requirements.

The problem description states that the function should take a tuple of tuples and return a list of averages for each position across all tuples. 

The program provided is:

```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Input**: The function expects a tuple containing multiple tuples.
2. **Output**: It returns a list where each element is the average of corresponding values from each tuple.
3. **Logic**: The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to group the elements of the tuples by their positions. Then it calculates the sum of each group and divides it by the total number of tuples to get the average.

### Potential Issues:
To determine if the function is correct, let's consider edge cases:
- What if the input is an empty tuple? The function would attempt to compute averages, but `len(tuples)` would be 0, leading to a division by zero error.
- What if the tuples are of different lengths? This could also lead to incorrect calculations since the averages would not be correctly aligned.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Input**:
   - Input: `func_1(())`
     - Expected: `[]` (since there are no tuples to average)
     - Actual: Results in a division by zero error.

2. **Different Lengths**:
   - Input: `func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))`
     - Expected: This input should raise an issue as the tuples have different lengths.
     - Actual: The average for the first position would be calculated, but the second position would cause an error or incorrect behavior when zipping.

Both cases show that the program does not handle empty tuples or tuples of differing lengths properly, which directly contradicts the problem description that suggests it should compute averages for all positions.

### Conclusion:
Since the function fails for at least one potential case (empty input and tuples of different lengths), we conclude that the function does not meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
