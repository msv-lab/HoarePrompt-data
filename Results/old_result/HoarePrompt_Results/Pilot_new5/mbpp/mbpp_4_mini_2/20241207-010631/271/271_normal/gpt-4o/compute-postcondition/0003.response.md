The code creates a list `elements_at_position` that contains the `i`-th element from each inner tuple in `tuples`. Given that `num_elements` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0, the `elements_at_position` will contain the first element of each inner tuple.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that contains at least one non-empty inner tuple, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.**
