The code initializes an empty list called `averages`. The variables `tuples` and `num_elements` remain unaffected and retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values; `num_elements` is the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples`; `averages` is an empty list.**
