Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function should split a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. However, the provided implementation returns sublists starting from each index `i` in the range of `n`, which leads to an incorrect result.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`, the expected output according to the problem description would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`â€”sublists that each take elements every 2 elements. However, the implementation returns `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4], [], []]`, which includes empty lists for indices greater than the length of the list.

Thus, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
