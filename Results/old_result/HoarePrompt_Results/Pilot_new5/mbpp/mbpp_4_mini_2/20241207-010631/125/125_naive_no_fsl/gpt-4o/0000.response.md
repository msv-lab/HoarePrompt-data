Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the length of the input list is less than the integer `n`. For example, consider the input:

```python
func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'], 5)
```

In this case, the expected output should be a list containing a single sublist with all elements in it, i.e., `[['a', 'b', 'c']]`. However, the actual output produced by the program will be:

```python
[['a'], ['b'], ['c'], []]
```

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, leading to an incorrect implementation. Thus, the program fails to produce the expected result for all inputs.
