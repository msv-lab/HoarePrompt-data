Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The description specifies that the function should split a list into sublists for every nth element and return a list of these resulting sublists. However, the program implementation splits the list at every index from 0 to n-1, resulting in sublists that are taken every nth element starting from each index i in the range of n.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and n is `2`, the expected output according to the problem description would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which splits the list into two sublists based on every second element. However, the program will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which happens to match the expected output in this specific case, but it is not the general behavior required by the problem.

The main issue is that the implementation does not accurately reflect the requirement of splitting the list into sublists based on a single nth value, as it generates a list of sublists starting from every index up to n-1, rather than creating just two sublists for an nth split.

Thus, the program does not consistently follow the problem description.
