According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `lst`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute for a third time. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `element` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `lst` must contain at least 3 elements, `i` will be increased to 2, and `element` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must contain at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `element` is the third element in `lst`**
