To analyze the provided program, let's first look at the problem description and the code:

**Problem description:** Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Initial Assessment:
The function aims to perform a bitwise AND operation on elements of two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`. The use of `zip` allows the function to process the tuples element-wise up to the length of the shorter tuple, which aligns with the expectation of handling tuples of differing lengths as described in the problem.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Different Length Tuples:** If one tuple is longer than the other, only the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple will be processed, which the code appears to handle correctly.
2. **Empty Tuples:** If both tuples are empty, the result should be an empty tuple, which the code would also handle correctly.
3. **Bitwise Operations with Non-Integer Types:** The program does not explicitly handle cases where the elements of the tuples are not integers (e.g., strings or floating-point numbers). If either tuple contains non-integer types, the operation could raise an error.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe the function correctly. They state that the function returns a tuple containing the result of the bitwise AND applied to corresponding elements, and it will ignore any excess elements in the longer tuple. This aligns with the code's functionality.

### Final Decision:
While the code performs the operation as expected for integer tuples, it does not handle cases where the tuples may contain non-integer types, which could lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirement for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation:** The code does not handle non-integer types, which can lead to errors during execution, making it incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. For example, if `func_1((1, 2), ('a', 3))` is called, it would raise a `TypeError` due to invalid operand types for the bitwise AND operation.
