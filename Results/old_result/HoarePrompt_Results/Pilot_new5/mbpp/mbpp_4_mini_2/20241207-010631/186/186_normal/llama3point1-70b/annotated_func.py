#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the result of the bitwise AND operation applied to the corresponding elements of tuples 'tup1' and 'tup2'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple containing the result of the bitwise AND operation applied to the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are of different lengths, it will only process elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.
