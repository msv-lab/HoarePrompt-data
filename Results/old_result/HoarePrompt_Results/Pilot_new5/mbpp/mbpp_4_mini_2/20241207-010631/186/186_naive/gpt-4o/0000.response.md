To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the description and the code.

The problem description states that we need to write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. The provided assertions suggest that the function should produce a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements from the two input tuples.

Here is the program provided:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` correctly performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. It uses the `zip` function to pair elements from both tuples, and the result is wrapped in a `tuple()` call, which creates a new tuple from the results of the generator expression.

2. **Assertions**:
   - For `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, the expected output is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is correct as:
     - 10 & 5 = 0
     - 4 & 2 = 0
     - 6 & 3 = 2
     - 9 & 3 = 1
   - For `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`, the expected output is `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which is also correct as:
     - 1 & 5 = 1
     - 2 & 6 = 2
     - 3 & 7 = 3
     - 4 & 8 = 0
   - For `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`, the expected output is `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which holds true as:
     - 8 & 7 = 0
     - 9 & 13 = 9
     - 11 & 14 = 10
     - 12 & 17 = 0

3. **Edge Cases**: The code should also handle tuples of different lengths. In Python, the `zip` function stops at the shortest input, so if one tuple is shorter, the program will still execute without error, but it may not provide a full output if this was not intended.

### Conclusion:
The function behaves correctly for the provided cases, and I do not see any immediate edge cases that would cause it to fail under usual circumstances. Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**.
