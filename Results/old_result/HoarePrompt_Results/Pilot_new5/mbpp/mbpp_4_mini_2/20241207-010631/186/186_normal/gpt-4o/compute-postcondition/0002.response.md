Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from both tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, it will only compute the AND for the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, effectively discarding any additional elements in the longer tuple. **
