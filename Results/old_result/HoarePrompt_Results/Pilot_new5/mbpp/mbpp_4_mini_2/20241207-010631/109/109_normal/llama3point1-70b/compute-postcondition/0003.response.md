The variable `list1` is assigned the reference to `list2`. Since `list1` starts as an empty list, after the assignment, `list1` will refer to the same list as `list2`, essentially making `list1` equal to `list2`. The state of `list2` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is equal to `list2`, `list1` contains the same elements as `list2`, and `list2` retains its original state.

Output State: **`list1` is equal to `list2` and contains the same elements as `list2`; `list2` is unchanged.**
