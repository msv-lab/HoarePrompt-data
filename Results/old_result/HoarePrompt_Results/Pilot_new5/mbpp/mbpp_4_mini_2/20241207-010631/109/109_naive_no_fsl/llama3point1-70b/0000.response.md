To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we analyze its behavior based on the problem description, which states that the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

### Problem Description:
- The function is supposed to take two lists.
- Replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

### Analyzing the Given Program:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        list1 = list2
    return list1
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. The function first checks if `list1` is not empty (`if list1:`).
2. If `list1` is not empty, it attempts to replace the last element of `list1` with `list2` using slice assignment (`list1[-1:] = list2`).
3. If `list1` is empty, it assigns `list2` to `list1` (which does not affect the original `list1` outside the function) and returns `list1`.

### Cases to Consider:
1. **Normal Case:** If `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [4, 5]`, the expected output should be `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. The program correctly replaces the last element.
  
2. **Empty `list1`:** If `list1 = []` and `list2 = [4, 5]`, the program assigns `list2` to `list1`, but this assignment does not affect the original `list1` passed to the function. Therefore, it effectively returns `[4, 5]`, which is not what the description states.

3. **Single Element List:** If `list1 = [1]` and `list2 = [2, 3]`, the expected output should be `[2, 3]`. The program correctly replaces the last element.

4. **Mutability of Lists:** The way the program modifies `list1` using slice assignment means that the original list will be modified, but it does not ensure that the function will always handle the case of an empty `list1` correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the case where `list1` is empty appropriately, because it assigns the new value to `list1` which does not affect the original list passed as an argument, leading to a potential unexpected behavior.

Correctness: **False** (The program does not work as expected when `list1` is empty, as it does not modify the original `list1` in that case.)
