Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. 

However, the implementation of the function `func_1` is as follows:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return list1[:-1] + list2
```

This code takes all elements of `list1` except for the last one (`list1[:-1]`) and concatenates them with all elements of `list2`. Therefore, it does not replace the last element of `list1` but rather removes it entirely and appends `list2` at the end.

For example, given the input `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])`, the expected output according to the problem description would be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which is indeed what the assertion checks for. However, it is incorrect because the last element `10` is removed instead of being replaced.

To illustrate the failure clearly: if `list1` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `list2` is `[4, 5]`, the correct result (where the last element `3` is replaced by `4` and `5`) would be `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. But the current program would incorrectly return `[1, 2] + [4, 5]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, which is not the intended operation of replacement.

Thus, the function does not follow the problem description as it does not perform the required replacement of the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.
