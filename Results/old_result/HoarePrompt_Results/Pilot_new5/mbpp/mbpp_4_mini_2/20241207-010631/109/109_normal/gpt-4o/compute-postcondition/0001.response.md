The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists. After executing the function body, it returns all elements of `list1` except the last one, concatenated with all elements of `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list that consists of all elements from `list1` except the last one, followed by all elements from `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a new list consisting of all elements from list1 except the last one, concatenated with all elements from list2.**
