You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two lists and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1 :
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else :
        list1 = list2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are both lists. If `list1` is non-empty, its last element is replaced by `list2`, while `list2` remains unchanged and `list1` is still a non-empty list. If `list1` is empty, then `list1` becomes equal to `list2`, containing the same elements as `list2`, and `list2` remains unchanged.
    return list1
    #The program returns list1, which will either have its last element replaced by list2 if list1 is non-empty, or it will be equal to list2 if list1 is empty. In both cases, list2 remains unchanged.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
