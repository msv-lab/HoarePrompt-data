Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to convert degrees to radians. 

Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `deg`, which is specified to be a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Conversion Formula**: The conversion from degrees to radians is accurately performed using the formula:
   \[
   \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
   \]
   This formula is correctly implemented in the return statement of the function:
   ```python
   return deg * math.pi / 180
   ```

3. **Output**: The function returns the calculated value in radians, which is exactly what is required by the problem description.

Since the function correctly converts degrees to radians for any numeric input, it adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, the program is correct.
