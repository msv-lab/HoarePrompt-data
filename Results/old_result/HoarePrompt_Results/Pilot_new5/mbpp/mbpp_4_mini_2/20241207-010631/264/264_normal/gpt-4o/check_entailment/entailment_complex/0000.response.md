Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians as stated in the problem description. Hereâ€™s the explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a numeric input `degrees` and computes its equivalent in radians using the formula `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. This formula is mathematically accurate for converting degrees to radians.

2. **Assertions**: The assertions provided (for 90, 60, and 120 degrees) validate that the function outputs the correct radian values for these specific inputs, confirming its correctness for those cases.

3. **Handling of Numeric Values**: The function is said to handle all numeric inputs, including negative values and zero. This is assured by the nature of the multiplication used in the conversion formula, which will yield correct results for all real numbers.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The program does not impose any restrictions on the input except that it must be numeric, which aligns with the problem description.

Given these points, the function meets the requirements laid out in the problem description consistently for all numeric cases. Thus, the correctness of the program is validated.
