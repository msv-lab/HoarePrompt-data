Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The issue arises when determining the `middle_index`. The line `middle_index = size - 1` is incorrect for finding the median. 

For two sorted lists of the same size \( n \), the merged list should have indices from \( 0 \) to \( 2n-1 \). If \( n \) is even, the median should be the average of the elements at indices \( n-1 \) and \( n \) in the merged list. However, when using `size - 1` and `size`, it results in accessing incorrect indices.

For example:
- If `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]` with `size = 2`, the merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The correct median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.
- The program would mistakenly calculate the median using `merged_list[1]` and `merged_list[2]`, leading to an index error.

Thus, the program fails to work correctly for the input cases where the lists have an even number of elements.
