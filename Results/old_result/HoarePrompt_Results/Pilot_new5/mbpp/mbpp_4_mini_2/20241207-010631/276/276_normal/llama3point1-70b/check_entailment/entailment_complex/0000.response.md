Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality as described in the problem description. Specifically, there are two main issues:

1. **Median Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the median is incorrect when handling the index. The `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which would be appropriate for accessing the last index of the list. However, for median calculations in a merged list of two sorted lists of the same size, the middle indices for an even-sized list should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. This means that if the size of the lists is even, the program should average the values at those two indices instead of averaging the values at `middle_index` and `middle_index + 1`.

2. **Assumptions About Input**: The program does not handle cases where `size` does not accurately reflect the length of the input lists. While the annotations mention that `list1` and `list2` are of the same size, there is no check to ensure that `size` is indeed correct, and the function could potentially lead to an index error if `size` is larger than the lengths of the lists.

These issues mean that the program does not reliably calculate the median of the two sorted lists under all possible valid conditions as stated in the problem description. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements for correctness.
