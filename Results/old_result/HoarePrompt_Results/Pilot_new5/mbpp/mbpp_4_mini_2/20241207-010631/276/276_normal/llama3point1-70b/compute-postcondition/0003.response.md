To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we can analyze the implications of the code on the variables present in the initial state.

1. `merged_list` is defined as a sorted list containing all integers from `list1` and `list2`.
2. The variable `middle_index` is defined as `size - 1`, and since `size` is even, we know its value.
3. The code computes the `median` by taking the average of the two middle elements in the sorted `merged_list`, specifically `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`.

From the above analysis, we can conclude:
- The `median` is assigned a value that is derived from the elements at the two middle positions of the `merged_list`.
- Since `size` is even, `middle_index` gives us a valid index in the `merged_list`, and thus the calculation is valid.

The `median` value is determined by the elements stored in `merged_list`, but we can't explicitly state the value of `median` without knowing the specific contents of `merged_list`.

Thus, the output will highlight the assignment of the `median` variable, indicating it is computed from elements in the merged list.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `size` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all integers from `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `median` is calculated as (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2.**
