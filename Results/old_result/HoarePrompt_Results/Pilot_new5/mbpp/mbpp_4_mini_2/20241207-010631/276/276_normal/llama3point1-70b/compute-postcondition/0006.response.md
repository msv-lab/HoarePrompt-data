Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, and `size` is a positive integer. If `size` is even, `median` is calculated as the average of the two middle values in the sorted `merged_list`. If `size` is odd, `median` is the middle value at index `middle_index` in the sorted `merged_list`.***
