Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the calculation of the median when the size is even. 

In the program, when `size` is even, it incorrectly uses the indices `middle_index` and `middle_index + 1` to access the two middle elements of the merged list. However, `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which results in incorrect indexing that leads to accessing elements that do not correspond to the two middle values in the sorted merged list.

For example, if both lists have a size of 4 (thus `size` is 4), `middle_index` will be 3. The correct indices for accessing the middle elements in a sorted list of size 8 (after merging) should be 3 and 4 (the elements at indices 3 and 4). The program instead accesses elements at indices 3 and 4, but it incorrectly assumes that these should be averaged without adjusting for the correct middle element indices.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in every case where the size of the lists is even.
