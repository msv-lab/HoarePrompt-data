To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` that is supposed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

The core logic of the implementation is as follows:
1. It merges the two sorted lists into one sorted list.
2. It calculates the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd.

Now, we should consider the following potential issues:

1. The assertion tests provided seem to indicate that the function works correctly for the examples given.
2. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input lists are empty or where they are of different sizes, even though the problem description states they are of "the same size."
3. The assumption that both lists are sorted is also crucial. If the precondition that they are sorted is violated, the result would be incorrect.
4. Edge cases concerning negative numbers, zeros, or duplicates in the lists should ideally be validated, but since the lists are sorted and of the same size, the median logic would still apply.

After examining these potential issues, we find that the logic for finding the median is sound given the constraints that the lists are sorted and of the same size. However, the function will fail for an empty list or if the lists aren't of the same size, which is a fundamental requirement not enforced by the function. 

Therefore, we can determine that there exists a case where the program does not work as expected (e.g., when both lists are empty). 

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
