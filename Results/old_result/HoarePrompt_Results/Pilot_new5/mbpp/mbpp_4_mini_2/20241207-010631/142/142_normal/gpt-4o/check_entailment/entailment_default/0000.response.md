To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem Description**: The function should check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. If every element in the list matches the given element, it should return True; otherwise, it returns False. Specifically, it should also return True if the list is empty.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True
```

**Initial Assessment**:
- The function iterates through each item in the list `lst`.
- If it encounters any item that is not equal to `element`, it returns False immediately.
- If it finishes iterating through the list without finding any discrepancies, it returns True.
- However, there is an edge case to consider: if the list is empty (`lst = []`), the function would return True, which aligns with the problem description.

**Output Hints**: According to the output hints:
- The function returns True if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`.
- It also states that for an empty list, the function will return True, as there are no elements that contradict the condition.

**Comparison of Output Hints and Code**:
The output hints agree with the code's behavior. The function correctly returns True if all items match or if the list is empty, and returns False if any item does not match.

**Conclusion**:
Upon analyzing both the problem description and the output hints, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including the empty list case. Since there are no cases where the function does not conform to the problem description, we conclude that the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly identifies cases where all elements in the list are equal to the specified element, including handling the edge case of an empty list appropriately by returning True.
