Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the provided list are equal to the given element. It iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that does not match the element. If it successfully checks all items without finding a mismatch, it returns `True`. 

The provided assertions confirm the functionality of the function for several cases:
- When the list contains different colors and the element is 'blue', it correctly returns `False`.
- When the list contains integers that do not match the element '7', it returns `False` as expected.
- When all items in the list are equal to the element 'green', it returns `True`.

No edge cases or missing logic are present based on the problem description, thus the code is correct for all potential inputs.
