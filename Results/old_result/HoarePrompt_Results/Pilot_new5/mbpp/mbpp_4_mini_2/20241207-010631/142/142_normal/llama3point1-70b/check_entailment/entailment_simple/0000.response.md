Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and an `element`. The function uses the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression to check if every item in the list is equal to the given `element`. 

Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. The function iterates through each item in the list `lst`.
2. It compares each item with the provided `element`.
3. The `all()` function returns `True` if all comparisons are `True`, meaning all items in the list are equal to `element`. If any item is not equal, it returns `False`.

This approach correctly verifies whether all items in the list are equal to the specified element, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, the implementation aligns perfectly with the stated functionality.
