According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which is an even number, and `n` is a positive integer. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (since it's a for loop that goes through `range(n + 1)`). Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 1**
