The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Explanation:
The problem description specifies that the function should take a positive integer `n` and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The binomial coefficients for a given integer can be obtained from the binomial expansion of `(x + y)^n`, specifically looking at the coefficients of the terms where the index is even.

However, the function `func_1` simply returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not compute the sum of the even index binomial coefficients. 

For example:
- For `n = 4`, the even index binomial coefficients from the expansion of `(x + y)^4` are:
  - Coefficients: 1 (x^0), 6 (x^2), 1 (x^4)
  - Their sum is `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`, which matches the assertion `assert func_1(4) == 8`, but this is coincidental and does not mean the function is correct.
  
- For `n = 6`, the even index binomial coefficients are:
  - Coefficients: 1 (x^0), 15 (x^2), 20 (x^4), 1 (x^6)
  - Their sum is `1 + 15 + 20 + 1 = 37`, but the assertion `assert func_1(6) == 32` fails because the function does not compute this correctly.

- For `n = 2`, the even index binomial coefficients are:
  - Coefficients: 1 (x^0), 1 (x^2)
  - Their sum is `1 + 1 = 2`, which matches the assertion.

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not correctly compute the sums of the even index binomial coefficients as required by the problem description, and the calculations for certain values of `n` do not hold for all cases, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
