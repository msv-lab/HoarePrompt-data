Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of combinations `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` from 0 to `n`. There are no indications in the code for handling cases where `n` is negative or zero, but as per the context of the inputs, it is assumed that `n` is always a positive integer.**
