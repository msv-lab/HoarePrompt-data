To evaluate the impact of the code, we must analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided. 

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `sum` is equal to 1 when `i` is odd, and when `i` is even, `sum` is updated to `1 + n`.
- `i` is 2 (which is even).

Since `i` is currently 2 (even), we know that before the execution of the code, `sum` would be updated to `1 + n`.

Next, we look at the line of code:
```
sum += math.comb(n, i)
```
Here, `math.comb(n, i)` computes the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time, which is `n! / (i! * (n - i)!)`.

Now, let's calculate the value of `sum` after the execution of this line of code.

1. Update `sum`: 
   - Initially, `sum` is `1 + n`.
   - After executing the code, `sum` will be updated to `sum + math.comb(n, 2)`.

Thus, we can express the final value of `sum` as:
- Final `sum` = `(1 + n) + math.comb(n, 2)`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `sum` and the conditions for `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `i` is 2; `sum` is equal to `(1 + n) + math.comb(n, 2)`**.
