To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we analyze the problem and the implementation:

**Problem Description:** The task is to write a function that takes in a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

**Program:**
```python
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

**Step 1: Understanding Binomial Coefficients**
The binomial coefficients for a given `n` are typically represented as `C(n, k)`, where `k` is the index ranging from `0` to `n`. The "even index binomial coefficients" refer to those coefficients where `k` is even.

For example, for `n = 4`, the binomial coefficients are:
- C(4, 0) = 1 (even index)
- C(4, 1) = 4 (odd index)
- C(4, 2) = 6 (even index)
- C(4, 3) = 4 (odd index)
- C(4, 4) = 1 (even index)

The sum of the even index binomial coefficients for `n = 4` is `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`, which matches the assertion in the program.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Implementation**
The function `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`. This appears to be an attempt to compute the sum related to the binomial coefficients. 

However, let's explore if this function works for all positive integers `n`:

- For `n = 2`, the even-index binomial coefficients are `C(2, 0) = 1` and `C(2, 2) = 1`. The sum is `1 + 1 = 2` which matches the assertion.
- For `n = 4`, as calculated above, the sum is `8`, which matches the assertion.
- For `n = 6`, the even-index binomial coefficients would be `C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) + C(6, 6) = 1 + 15 + 15 + 1 = 32`, which also matches the assertion.

Now, let's consider edge cases:
1. `n = 1`: The binomial coefficients are `C(1, 0) = 1`, giving a sum of `1`, but `func_1(1)` returns `2 ** (1 - 1) = 1` which is correct.
2. `n = 0`: This is not a positive integer, but if we consider it, `func_1(0)` is not defined in the context of the problem, and hence should not be considered.

**Step 3: Conclusion**
After examining various cases and the implementation, I find that the function correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients as required by the problem description for all tested positive integers.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
