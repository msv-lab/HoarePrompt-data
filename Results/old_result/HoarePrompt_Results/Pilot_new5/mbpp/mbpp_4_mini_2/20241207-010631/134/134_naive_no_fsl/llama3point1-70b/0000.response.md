To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(n)`.

### Problem Description:
The task is to compute the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given positive integer `n`. The binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` counts the ways to choose `k` elements from `n` elements, and the even index coefficients are those where the index `i` is even.

### Program Analysis:
The code provided is as follows:

```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
    return sum
```

1. **Initialization**: The variable `sum` is initialized to `0`.
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates over all integers `i` from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
3. **Condition**: For each `i`, it checks if `i` is even using `i % 2 == 0`.
4. **Sum Calculation**: If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to `sum`.
5. **Return**: Finally, it returns the computed `sum`.

### Checking for Edge Cases:
Let's check various values of `n`:

- **For n = 1**:
  - The even indices are `0`. The program evaluates `C(1, 0)` = 1. 
  - Expected output: 1. The program returns 1. **Correct**.

- **For n = 2**:
  - The even indices are `0` and `2`. The program evaluates `C(2, 0)` + `C(2, 2)` = 1 + 1 = 2.
  - Expected output: 2. The program returns 2. **Correct**.

- **For n = 3**:
  - The even indices are `0` and `2`. The program evaluates `C(3, 0)` + `C(3, 2)` = 1 + 3 = 4.
  - Expected output: 4. The program returns 4. **Correct**.

- **For n = 4**:
  - The even indices are `0`, `2`, and `4`. The program evaluates `C(4, 0)` + `C(4, 2)` + `C(4, 4)` = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8.
  - Expected output: 8. The program returns 8. **Correct**.

- **For n = 5**:
  - The even indices are `0`, `2`, and `4`. The program evaluates `C(5, 0)` + `C(5, 2)` + `C(5, 4)` = 1 + 10 + 5 = 16.
  - Expected output: 16. The program returns 16. **Correct**.

### Conclusion:
For all the tested values of `n`, the function produces the expected output based on the problem description. Since the program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for positive integers, it works as intended for all cases considered.

Correctness: **True**
