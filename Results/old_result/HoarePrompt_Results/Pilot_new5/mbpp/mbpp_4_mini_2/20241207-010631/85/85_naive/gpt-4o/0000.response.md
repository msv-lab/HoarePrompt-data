Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly finds the maximum difference between any two elements in the provided array. It first calculates the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions. Then, it computes the difference between these two values, which represents the maximum difference. 

The assertions provided also serve as valid test cases, and they all return the expected results:

1. For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum value is `5` and the minimum is `1`, so the difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
2. For `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the maximum is `9` and the minimum is `1`, thus the difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
3. For `(3, 2, 1)`, the maximum is `3` and the minimum is `1`, resulting in a difference of `3 - 1 = 2`.

The function handles all potential cases, including when there are negative numbers or when the maximum and minimum values are the same, in which case the difference would be zero. Since it works correctly for the provided cases and any other logical cases, the program is verified to be correct.
