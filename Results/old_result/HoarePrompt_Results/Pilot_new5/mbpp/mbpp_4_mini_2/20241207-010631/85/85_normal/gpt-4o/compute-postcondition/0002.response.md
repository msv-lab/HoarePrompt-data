The variable `max_diff` is assigned the value of `max_val - min_val`. Since `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr` and `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`, `max_diff` represents the difference between these two values. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`, `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.**
