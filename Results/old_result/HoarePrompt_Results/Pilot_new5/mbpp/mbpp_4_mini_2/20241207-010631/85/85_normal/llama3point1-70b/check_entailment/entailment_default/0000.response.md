The code provided is intended to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The implementation uses the `max()` and `min()` functions to achieve this.

1. **Initial Assessment**: 
   - The function correctly calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list when the list contains elements. However, it does not handle the edge case where the input list is empty, which would raise a `ValueError` due to the use of `max()` and `min()` functions.

2. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints clarify that a `ValueError` will be raised if the input list is empty. This aligns with the observed behavior of the code. The hints also confirm the function's expected behavior for non-empty lists.

Based on the above considerations, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case â€” specifically, it does not handle an empty list scenario, which is a valid edge case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle the case when the input list is empty, leading to an unhandled exception, which does not conform to the problem description that implies a valid result should be returned for all cases, including the empty list.
