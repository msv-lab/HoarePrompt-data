The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If the list is empty, a `ValueError` will be raised due to the use of `max()` and `min()` functions, which do not handle empty lists. Therefore, the function may not return a valid result for an empty input list.
