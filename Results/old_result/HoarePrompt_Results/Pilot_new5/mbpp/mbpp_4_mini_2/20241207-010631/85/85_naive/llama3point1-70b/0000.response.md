Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does this by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array using the `max()` and `min()` functions. 

This solution handles various cases properly:
- If the array has at least two elements, it will find a valid maximum and minimum, thus returning the correct difference.
- If the array has only one element, the maximum and minimum will be the same, resulting in a difference of zero, which is also correct.
- If the array is empty, this will raise a ValueError. However, since the problem does not specify what to do in that case, we can assume the input will always have at least two elements based on typical use cases for finding differences.

Therefore, it appears that the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description for all potential valid cases, confirming its correctness.
