Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array `arr` of integers as input. The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list using the expression `max(arr) - min(arr)`.

This implementation adheres to the problem description because:

1. It computes the maximum value in the array using `max(arr)`.
2. It computes the minimum value in the array using `min(arr)`.
3. It then calculates the difference between these two values, which effectively gives the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

This approach works for all potential cases, including:
- Arrays with positive integers.
- Arrays with negative integers.
- Arrays containing both positive and negative integers.
- An array with a single element (the difference will be 0).
- An empty array would raise an error but based on the problem description, we assume input will be valid.

Since the function fulfills the requirement of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, we can conclude that it is correct.
