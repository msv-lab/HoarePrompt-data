Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. While it correctly computes the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list (which is a valid interpretation of the "maximum difference"), it fails to consider the requirement of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Here are the issues:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The function does not handle the case of an empty list appropriately. If `arr` is empty, calling `min(arr)` and `max(arr)` will raise a `ValueError`. The problem description implies that the function should handle any list provided, but it does not specify what to do with an empty list.

2. **Maximum Difference Interpretation**: The problem description suggests finding the maximum difference between any two elements, which can be interpreted as needing to compare all pairs of elements in the array, not just the maximum and minimum. For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`, but if the list were to contain other variations, the maximum difference could differ based on which elements are compared.

In conclusion, the program is incorrect because it does not appropriately handle all potential edge cases such as empty lists and does not fulfill the requirement of finding the maximum difference between any two elements comprehensively.
