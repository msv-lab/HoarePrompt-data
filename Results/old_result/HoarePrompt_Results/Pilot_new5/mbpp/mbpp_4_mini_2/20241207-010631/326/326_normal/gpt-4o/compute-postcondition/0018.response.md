Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to `len(arr)`, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`. If `n` is 2, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. If `n` is greater than 2, `min_diff` is the smallest difference found between all pairs of consecutive elements in the sorted list.**
