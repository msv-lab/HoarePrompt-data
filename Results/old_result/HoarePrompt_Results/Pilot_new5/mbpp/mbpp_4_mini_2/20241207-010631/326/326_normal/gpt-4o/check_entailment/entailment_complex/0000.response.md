Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully satisfy the problem description, which requires finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. 

Here are the main issues:

1. **Handling of Non-Consecutive Elements**: The function only calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the problem description specifies the need to find the minimum difference between any two elements, not just consecutive ones. For instance, in the input `(30, 5, 20, 9)`, the minimum difference should include comparing `30` and `20` or `30` and `9`, as well as the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Duplicate Elements**: The function does not explicitly handle cases where the array may contain duplicate elements. If two elements are the same, the difference would be zero, which should be considered as a valid minimum difference. The problem description does not specify that duplicates should be ignored.

In summary, while the program does find minimum differences between consecutive elements of the sorted array, it does not meet the requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements, leading to its incorrectness with respect to the problem description.
