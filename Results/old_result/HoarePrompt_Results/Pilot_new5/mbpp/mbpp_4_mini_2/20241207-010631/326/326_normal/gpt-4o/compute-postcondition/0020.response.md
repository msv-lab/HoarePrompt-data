The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in `arr`, such that `n` is equal to the length of `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is equal to 2, the function returns the difference between the two elements in `arr`. If `n` is greater than 2, the function returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `arr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n`, and return the minimum difference between consecutive elements in `arr` or handle the case of insufficient elements by returning 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers arr and a positive integer n. If n is less than 2, it returns 0. If n is 2, it returns the difference between the two elements in arr. If n is greater than 2, it returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list arr.**
