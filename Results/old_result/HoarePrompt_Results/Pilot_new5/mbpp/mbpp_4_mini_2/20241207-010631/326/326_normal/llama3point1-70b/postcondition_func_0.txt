The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, sorts the list, and returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list. However, it does not utilize the `target` parameter in any way, suggesting that its intended role is not fulfilled. Additionally, if `arr` contains fewer than 2 elements, the function may lead to an index error since it relies on the existence of consecutive elements to calculate differences.
