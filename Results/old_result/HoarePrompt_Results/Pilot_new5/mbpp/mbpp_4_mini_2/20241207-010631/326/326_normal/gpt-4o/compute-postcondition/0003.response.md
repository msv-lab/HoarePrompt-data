The code `arr = sorted(arr)` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation, and it remains equal to the length of `arr`, which is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. After the sorting operation, the order of the elements within `arr` will be changed, but the elements themselves are still integers.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in `arr`, such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 (n >= 2) and n == len(arr).**
