The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given that `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0, we can determine that `diff` will be equal to the difference between the first two elements of `arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of `arr`, and the values of `arr` and `i` are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to len(arr), `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to len(arr), `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]**
