The value of `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. The initial value of `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`, which is less than `min_diff` (positive infinity). Therefore, after executing the code, `min_diff` will no longer be positive infinity but will instead be equal to the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`, and the current value of `diff` is less than `min_diff`.**
