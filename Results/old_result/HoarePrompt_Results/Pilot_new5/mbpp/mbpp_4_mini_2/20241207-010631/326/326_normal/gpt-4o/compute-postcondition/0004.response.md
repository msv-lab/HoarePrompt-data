The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This operation does not alter the values of `arr` or `n`, and since `min_diff` is initialized to infinity, it indicates that no minimum difference has been calculated yet. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in `arr`, such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 (n >= 2) and n == len(arr); `min_diff` is positive infinity.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in `arr`, such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 (n >= 2) and n == len(arr); `min_diff` is positive infinity.**
