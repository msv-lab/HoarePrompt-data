Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description states that the function should find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the implementation only calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in a sorted version of the array. 

This approach fails to consider the minimum difference between non-consecutive elements, which may exist and could be smaller than the differences computed between consecutive elements. For example, given the input array `[1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25]`, the minimum difference between any two elements would be `1` (between `18` and `19`), but if the elements were structured differently, such as `[1, 4, 6]`, the closest difference would still be found.

To illustrate a case of failure, consider the array `[1, 3, 6]`. The minimum difference is `2` (between `1` and `3`), but if the array were to include 4, the minimum difference would be `1` (between `3` and `4`). The program would miss that.

Thus, the correct implementation should involve comparing all possible pairs of elements in the array rather than just consecutive ones in the sorted list. 

In summary, the implementation is not correct as it does not satisfy the problem requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.
