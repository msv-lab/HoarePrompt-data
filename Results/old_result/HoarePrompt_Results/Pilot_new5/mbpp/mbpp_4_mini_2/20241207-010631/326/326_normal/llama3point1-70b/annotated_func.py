#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns min_diff, which is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, sorts the list, and returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list. However, it does not utilize the `target` parameter in any way, suggesting that its intended role is not fulfilled. Additionally, if `arr` contains fewer than 2 elements, the function may lead to an index error since it relies on the existence of consecutive elements to calculate differences.
