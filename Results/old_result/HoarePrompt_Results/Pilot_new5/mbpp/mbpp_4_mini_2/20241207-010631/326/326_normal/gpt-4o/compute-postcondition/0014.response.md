According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is equal to `len(arr)`, which is at least 2 since `arr` has at least 2 elements (making `n` at least 2). Therefore, `n - 1` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. As such, the new value of `i` will be 2. For the loop to run again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`, which means `n` must be greater than `2`. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `diff` is updated to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
