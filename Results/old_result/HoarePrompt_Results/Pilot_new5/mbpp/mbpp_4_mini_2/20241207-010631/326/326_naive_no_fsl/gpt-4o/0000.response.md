Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, as specified in the problem description. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its correctness:

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if `n < 2`. If this is the case, it returns `0`, which is appropriate since at least two elements are needed to calculate a difference.

2. **Sorting**: It sorts the array, which is necessary because the minimum difference can only occur between adjacent elements in a sorted list.

3. **Difference Calculation**: The function iterates through the sorted array to calculate the differences between consecutive elements. It keeps track of the minimum difference found.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the minimum difference, which is the expected output.

The provided assertions indicate that the function works correctly for the given test cases, and I could not find any case where the logic fails. For instance:

- In the first assertion, `(1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25)`, the sorted array is `[1, 3, 5, 18, 19, 25]`, and the minimum difference is `1` (between 18 and 19).
- In the second assertion, `(4, 3, 2, 6)`, the sorted array is `[2, 3, 4, 6]`, and the minimum difference is `1` (between 2 and 3).
- In the third assertion, `(30, 5, 20, 9)`, the sorted array is `[5, 9, 20, 30]`, and the minimum difference is `4` (between 5 and 9).

Given that all these assertions pass and that I did not find any inputs or edge cases where the function fails, the program is correct.
