`min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, and since `min_diff` now takes this value, it results in `min_diff` being equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])**
