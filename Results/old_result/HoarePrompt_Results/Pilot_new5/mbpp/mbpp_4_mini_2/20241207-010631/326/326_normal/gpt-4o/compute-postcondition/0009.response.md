Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to `len(arr)`, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. If `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`, which is the difference between the first two elements of `arr`.***
