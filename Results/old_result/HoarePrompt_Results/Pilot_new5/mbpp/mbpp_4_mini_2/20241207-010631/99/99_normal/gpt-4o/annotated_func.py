#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of characters.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
    #The program returns a new string formed by joining characters from the original string 's' that are located at even indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string consisting of characters from `s` that are located at even indices. If `s` is empty, it returns an empty string.
