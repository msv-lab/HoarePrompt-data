Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the input string that are at odd index values, returning only those characters at even index values. The assertions confirm that the function produces the expected results for various test cases:

1. For the input `'abcdef'`, the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `'a'`, `'c'`, and `'e'`, resulting in `'ace'`.
2. For the input `'python'`, the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `'p'`, `'t'`, and `'o'`, resulting in `'pto'`.
3. For the input `'data'`, the characters at even indices (0, 2) are `'d'` and `'t'`, resulting in `'dt'`.
4. For the input `'lambs'`, the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `'l'`, `'m'`, and `'s'`, resulting in `'lms'`.

The function reliably handles strings of various lengths and contents, including strings with an even or odd number of characters. There are no edge cases or potential failures identified in the provided examples. Hence, the program is considered correct.
