To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether it correctly handles all potential cases for subtracting elements of two tuples.

The given program is:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Problem Description:
The function should take in two tuples and subtract the elements of the first tuple (`tup1`) by the elements of the second tuple (`tup2`) at the same index.

### Analysis:
1. **Input Types**: The function expects two tuples. If they are not tuples, the program does not handle this case explicitly, which could lead to an error.
2. **Different Lengths**: If the two tuples have different lengths, `zip` will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple, thus ignoring any excess elements in the longer tuple. This means not all elements will be processed, violating the requirement to subtract "elements by the same index".
3. **Element Types**: The program assumes that the elements of the tuples are numeric types (integers or floats), but it does not handle cases where the elements might not be numeric, which could also lead to a `TypeError`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following case:
- `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)`
- `tup2 = (4, 5)` 

When calling `func_1(tup1, tup2)`, the program will return `(1 - 4, 2 - 5)` which results in `(-3, -3)`, but it ignores the element `3` from `tup1`. This is incorrect behavior since the program does not handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths correctly.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle cases of differing tuple lengths correctly and could potentially encounter type errors with non-numeric types, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
