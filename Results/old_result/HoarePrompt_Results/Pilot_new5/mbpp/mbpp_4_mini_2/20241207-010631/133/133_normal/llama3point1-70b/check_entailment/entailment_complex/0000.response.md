Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, while the function correctly calculates the element-wise subtraction of two tuples of the same length, it lacks handling for the following scenarios:

1. **Different Length Tuples**: The program assumes that both tuples are of the same length, but does not implement any checks to enforce or validate this assumption. If the tuples provided are of different lengths, `zip` will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple, potentially leading to incorrect results. The problem description does not state that the function should work with tuples of different lengths, but it also does not specify that such cases should not be handled, leaving ambiguity.

2. **Non-numeric Types**: The program also does not handle the case where the tuples may contain non-numeric types. If any element in either tuple is non-numeric, a `TypeError` will be raised during the subtraction operation. The problem description does not specify what should happen in such cases, which could lead to runtime errors that the function does not account for.

Due to these reasons, the program does not conform to the problem description sufficiently, resulting in an incorrect assessment of its correctness. Therefore, it cannot be considered fully correct.
