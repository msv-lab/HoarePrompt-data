The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numeric values. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`, calculated as (a - b) for each pair of elements zipped together from the two tuples. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of the same length containing numeric values and return a tuple of the differences between their corresponding elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, tup1 and tup2, and returns a tuple containing differences between corresponding elements of the two tuples.**
