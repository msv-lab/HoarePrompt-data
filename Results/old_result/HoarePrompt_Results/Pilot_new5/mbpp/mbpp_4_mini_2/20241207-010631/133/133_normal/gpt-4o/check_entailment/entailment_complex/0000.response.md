Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` assumes that the input tuples `tup1` and `tup2` are of the same length. However, the problem description does not specify this assumption. 

If the tuples provided to the function are of different lengths, `zip` will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple, leading to potentially incorrect results or missing differences for the elements in the longer tuple. This means that the behavior of the function becomes undefined in cases where the input tuples have different lengths, which contradicts the problem requirement that states the function should subtract corresponding elements.

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`, the function would return `(-2, -2)` instead of raising an error or indicating that the lengths are mismatched. This violates the conditions set forth in the problem description, making the implementation incorrect.
