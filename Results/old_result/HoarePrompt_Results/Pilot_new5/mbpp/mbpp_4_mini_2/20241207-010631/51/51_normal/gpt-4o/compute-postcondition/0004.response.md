The `product` is assigned the value of `product` multiplied by `num`. Since `product` is equal to the second element in the `numbers` list and `num` is also equal to the second element in the `numbers` list, the operation effectively squares the second element in the list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 2 elements, `product` is equal to the square of the second element in the list, `num` is equal to the second element in the numbers list**.
