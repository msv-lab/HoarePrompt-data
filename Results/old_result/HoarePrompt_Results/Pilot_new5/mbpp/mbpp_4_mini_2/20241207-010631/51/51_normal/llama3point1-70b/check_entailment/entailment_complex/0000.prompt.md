You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats) with at least one element.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least one element, `product` is equal to the product of all elements in `numbers`, and `num` is the last element of `numbers`.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of the numbers in the list 'numbers', calculated as the product of all elements in 'numbers' divided by the length of 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers (integers or floats) and returns the average of the numbers, calculated as the product of all elements in the list divided by the length of the list. However, this approach is incorrect for calculating an average, as it multiplies all numbers instead of summing them. Additionally, if the list contains a zero, the function will return zero since the product will be zero, which may not be a valid average in context.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
