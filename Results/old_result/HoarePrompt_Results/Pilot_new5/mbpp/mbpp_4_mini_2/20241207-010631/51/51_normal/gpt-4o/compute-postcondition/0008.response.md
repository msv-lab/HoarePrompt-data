The variable `result` is assigned the value of `product` divided by the length of `numbers`. The value of `product` is the product of all elements in the `numbers` list, and since `numbers` is not empty, `len(numbers)` will be a positive integer. Therefore, `result` will be a value that represents the average of the products per element in the `numbers` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that is not empty, `product` is equal to the product of all elements in the `numbers` list, `result` is equal to `product / len(numbers)`.**
