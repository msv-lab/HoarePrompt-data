Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If `numbers` is an empty list, the code will attempt to calculate `len(numbers)` which would be `0`, leading to a division by zero error when trying to execute `result = product / len(numbers)`. This scenario is not covered by the provided logic and will raise an exception, violating the requirements of the problem description.
