The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) and contains at least one element. After executing the function body, it calculates the average of the numbers in the list by taking the product of all elements in `numbers` and dividing it by the length of `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numbers and return the average of those numbers determined by the product of the elements divided by the count of elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the average of the numbers, calculated as the product of all elements divided by the length of the list.**
