#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floats, and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that is not empty, `product` is equal to the product of all elements in the `numbers` list.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the average of the elements in the 'numbers' list, where 'product' is the product of all elements and 'len(numbers)' is the number of elements in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of integers or floats, calculates the product of all the elements in the list, and returns the average by dividing the product by the number of elements. However, if any element in the list is zero, the product will be zero, leading to an average of zero, which may not reflect the intended average of the elements in the list. Additionally, if the list contains only one element, the average returned will be equal to that element, which is accurate, but the function does not explicitly handle cases where the list might contain non-numeric types or empty lists (though the problem states the list is non-empty).
