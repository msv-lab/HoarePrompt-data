Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes in two parameters: `array`, which is expected to be a list of elements, and `element`, which is the value to be searched within the array.

2. **Element Presence Check**: The function uses the `index()` method of the list, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found in the list. This aligns with the requirement to determine if the element is present in the array.

3. **Return Values**:
   - If the element is found in the array, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. This is precisely what the problem description specifies.
   - If the element is not found, the function catches the `ValueError` and returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`, which also adheres to the problem requirements.

4. **Comprehensive Handling**: The use of the try-except block ensures that both scenarios (element found and not found) are handled gracefully and correctly.

Since the program covers all specified cases and adheres to the problem description, it is considered correct.
