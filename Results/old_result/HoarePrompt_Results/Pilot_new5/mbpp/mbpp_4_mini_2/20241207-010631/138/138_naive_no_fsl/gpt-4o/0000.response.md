Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check if an element is present in the provided array. It iterates through the array using `enumerate`, returning a tuple that contains `True` and the index of the element if it is found. If the element is not found, it correctly returns `(False, -1)`. 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works for the cases presented, and it handles the fundamental cases of finding an element and not finding an element. 

Additionally, the function should work for:
1. An empty array: `func_1([], 1)` should return `(False, -1)`.
2. An array without the element: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)` should return `(False, -1)`.
3. An array with duplicates: `func_1([1, 2, 1, 3], 1)` should return `(True, 0)` or `(True, 2)` depending on the first occurrence.

Since I cannot find any potential input cases where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
