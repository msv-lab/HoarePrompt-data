The function accepts a list `array` and a value `element`. It attempts to find the index of `element` in `array`. If `element` is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If `element` is not found, it catches the `ValueError` and returns a tuple containing `False` and -1. The function correctly handles the case where the element is not present in the list by returning a specific tuple indicating the absence.
