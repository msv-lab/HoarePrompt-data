The program provided is meant to search for an element in an array and return a tuple indicating whether the element is present and its index, or -1 if not found. 

Let's analyze the code:

1. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and an `element` as inputs.
2. It uses a `for` loop with `enumerate` to iterate through the array, checking each value against the `element`.
3. If a match is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the found element.
4. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.

According to the problem description:
- The function must return a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Now, let's validate if the function meets all the criteria described:

- It correctly checks each element in the entire array, returning `True` and the index if the element is found.
- If the element is not found after checking all items, the function returns `False` and -1, as required.
- The program does not limit the search to the first three positions, which is not mentioned in the problem statement, allowing it to work properly even if the element is present at any position in the list or not present at all.

Given all of the above, the function fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description under all circumstances.

Correctness: **True**
