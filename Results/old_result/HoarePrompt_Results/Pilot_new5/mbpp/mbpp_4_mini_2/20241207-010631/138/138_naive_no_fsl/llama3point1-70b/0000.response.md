Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as inputs. The function uses the `index` method of the list to find the index of the element in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index position. If the element is not found, a `ValueError` is raised, which is caught by the `except` block, and the function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`. 

This implementation covers all potential cases:
1. If the element is present in the array, it will return `True` and the correct index.
2. If the element is not present in the array, it will return `False` and `-1`.

Thus, the program works as expected according to the problem description for all possible inputs.
