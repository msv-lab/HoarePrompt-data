The program could raise a `ValueError` if the `element` is not found in the `array` during the execution of `index = array.index(element)`. If the element is found, the function returns `True` along with the index of the element in the array. However, if the element is not present, a `ValueError` is raised, leading to the `except` block being executed, which returns `False` and -1. 

Therefore, the output state is: `array` is a list of elements, and `element` is a value that may or may not be present in the `array`. If the element is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element; if not found, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1.
