Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(numbers)` correctly identifies and returns even numbers from the provided list of numbers. The logic implemented in the function uses a list comprehension that iterates through each number in the input list and includes it in the resulting list if it satisfies the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which checks for even numbers.

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases:
1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output is `[2, 4]`, which correctly identifies the even numbers.
2. For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, the output is `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, capturing all even numbers including zero.
3. For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, the output is `[8, 12]`, again correctly identifying even numbers.

Since I could not identify any edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail to produce the correct results as per the problem description, I conclude that the function is correct for any list of integers provided as input.
