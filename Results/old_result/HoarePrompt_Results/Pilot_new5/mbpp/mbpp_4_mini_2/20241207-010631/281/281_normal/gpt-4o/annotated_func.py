#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns a new list containing only the even integers from that list. It does not handle cases where `numbers` might be empty or contain non-integer types, but it will return an empty list if no even integers are found or if the input list is empty.
