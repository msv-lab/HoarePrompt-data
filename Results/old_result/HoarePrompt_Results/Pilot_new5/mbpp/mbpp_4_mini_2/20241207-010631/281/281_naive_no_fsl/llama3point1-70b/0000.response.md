Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. 

This will work for all types of numeric inputs in Python, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. For example:
- Calling `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4])` will return `[2, 4]`
- Calling `func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4])` will return `[-2, -4]`
- Calling `func_1([0, 1, 2])` will return `[0, 2]`

There are no edge cases or potential inputs where the function would fail to find all even numbers correctly, thus confirming that the implementation adheres to the problem description.
