The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius^2 * height. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height` and return the calculated volume of a cone based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both of which are non-negative real numbers, and returns the volume of a cone calculated using the formula (1/3) * π * radius^2 * height.**
