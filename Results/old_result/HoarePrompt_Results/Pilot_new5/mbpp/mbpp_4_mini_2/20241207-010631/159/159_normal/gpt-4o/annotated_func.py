#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of a cone calculated using the formula (1/3) * π * radius^2 * height. It does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` is negative, nor does it account for the possibility of non-numeric inputs.
