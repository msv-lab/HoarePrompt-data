Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases as required by the problem description. While the function `func_1` does implement the formula to calculate the volume of a cone correctly for non-negative real numbers, it lacks input validation.

Specifically, the function does not account for the following potential issues:
1. It does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` is negative. According to the problem description, the function should only accept non-negative real numbers, but this requirement is not enforced within the function itself.
2. It does not check for non-numeric inputs, which could lead to errors if a user tries to pass in values that are not numbers.

These shortcomings mean that the function may produce incorrect results or raise errors when given invalid inputs, which does not align with the requirement of the problem description. Thus, while the computation itself may be correct for valid inputs, the lack of input validation renders the overall implementation incorrect.
