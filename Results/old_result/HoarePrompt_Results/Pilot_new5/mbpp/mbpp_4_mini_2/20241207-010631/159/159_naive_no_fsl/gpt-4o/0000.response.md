To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description (to find the volume of a cone), we need to analyze the function and its behavior with various inputs.

The formula for the volume of a cone is:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The provided function `func_1` implements this formula correctly.

The assertions provided in the code check specific cases:
1. `func_1(5, 12)` should return approximately `314.15926535897927`
2. `func_1(10, 15)` should return approximately `1570.7963267948965`
3. `func_1(19, 17)` should return approximately `6426.651371693521`

All of these assertions are consistent with the formula for the volume of a cone.

To consider potential edge cases:
- What if the radius or height is zero? The volume should be zero in these cases:
  - `func_1(0, 10)` should return `0` (correctly gives volume = 0)
  - `func_1(5, 0)` should also return `0` (correctly gives volume = 0)
  - `func_1(0, 0)` should return `0` (correctly gives volume = 0)

- Negative values for radius or height are not physically meaningful in the context of a cone's volume. The current implementation does not handle these cases explicitly, as it will output a negative volume if negative values are provided.

For example:
- `func_1(-5, 10)` would return a negative volume which is not valid.
- `func_1(5, -10)` would also return a negative volume.

Since the program fails to account for negative values of radius and height, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **False**
