The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, the program returns the volume of a cone, calculated as (1/3) * π * radius² * height. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and return the volume of a cone based on these values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both non-negative real numbers, and returns the volume of a cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius² * height.**
