Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where negative values for `radius` or `height` are provided. According to the problem description, the function must find the volume of a cone, but it does not account for the validity of the input. While the annotations state that the input parameters should be non-negative real numbers, the function does not enforce this requirement, leading to the potential for incorrect calculations or unexpected results when negative values are passed. 

For instance, if a negative radius or height is given, the formula would still compute a volume, which does not make sense in the context of a physical cone. This means the function can produce incorrect outputs when the input does not meet the specified constraints, failing the requirement of the problem description. Therefore, the program is not correct.
