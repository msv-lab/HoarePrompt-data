The provided code calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \((\frac{1}{3}) \cdot Ï€ \cdot \text{radius}^2 \cdot \text{height}\). The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `radius` and `height`, and computes the volume based on these inputs.

The problem description states that the function must compute the volume of a cone, without specifics about handling edge cases related to input values.

Upon examining the code and the problem description, it seems that the function correctly implements the mathematical formula for the volume of a cone. However, the description does not refer to any constraints on the type of input values.

The output hints indicate that the function accepts two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of the cone. It also states that negative values are not handled, and the function does not account for non-numeric inputs. 

This presents a potential issue: if either `radius` or `height` is negative, the function will still return a volume using the formula, which is mathematically incorrect since the volume cannot be negative. Additionally, if non-numeric values are passed to the function, it will raise a TypeError.

Overall, the code does not cover all the edge cases outlined in the output hints, specifically the handling of negative and non-numeric inputs. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails in cases where `radius` or `height` is negative, or when non-numeric inputs are provided, as it does not handle these situations according to the problem description.
