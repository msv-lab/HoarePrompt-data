Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement to remove all whitespaces from a string. The use of `input_str.replace(' ', '')` only removes spaces (' '), but there are other types of whitespace characters (such as tabs `\t`, newlines `\n`, and other non-breaking spaces) that are not addressed by this implementation. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of removing all types of whitespace from the input string. 

A correct implementation would require removing all characters that are considered whitespace, not just spaces. The Python method `str.replace` is insufficient for this task in its current form. A better approach would be to use `str.join` with `str.split()` or `str.translate()` with `str.maketrans()` to cover all whitespace characters.
