Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly removes all whitespace characters from the input string. It uses the `replace` method to replace spaces (' ') with an empty string (''). The provided assertions test various cases, including different numbers of spaces and leading spaces, and they all pass as expected. Since these cases cover typical scenarios of whitespace in strings, and the function meets the problem description's requirement, the code is correct.
