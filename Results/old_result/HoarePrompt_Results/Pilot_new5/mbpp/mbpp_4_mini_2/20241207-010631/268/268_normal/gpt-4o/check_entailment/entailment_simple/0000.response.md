The provided program is intended to find the maximum value of the n-th column in a matrix represented as a list of lists. Let's examine the program step by step against the problem description.

1. The function `func_1(matrix, n)` takes two parameters: `matrix`, which is a list of lists, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer representing the desired column index.

2. Inside the function, it creates a list called `nth_column`, which extracts the n-th element (column) from each row of the matrix using a list comprehension. This is done with the line:
   ```python
   nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
   ```

3. The program then calculates the maximum value of the `nth_column` list using the `max()` function:
   ```python
   return max(nth_column)
   ```

Now, let's analyze whether the function adheres strictly to the problem description:

- The implementation correctly extracts the n-th column from each row of the matrix. 
- It then correctly computes the maximum value from that column.
- The assertion statements provided in the code cover different test cases, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for various inputs.
- The function also assumes the input will satisfy the conditions mentioned in the problem description (i.e., that `n` is a valid index for the provided non-empty matrix).

There are no edge cases or exceptions for this specific implementation based on the problem description, as the assertions ensure all test cases are handled correctly.

Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
