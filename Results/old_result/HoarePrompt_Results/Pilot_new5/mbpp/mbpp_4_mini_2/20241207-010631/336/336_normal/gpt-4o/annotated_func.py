#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers containing at least 2 integers, all integers at odd indices are odd, and if the length of `lst` is greater than 1, the loop has executed without returning False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the loop has executed without returning False and that the list contains at least 2 integers with all integers at odd indices being odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns False if any integer at an odd index is even. If all integers at odd indices are odd and the list contains at least 2 integers, it returns True. The function does not handle cases where the list has fewer than 2 integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
