According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. The loop starts at index 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches the length of the list. For the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 2 elements, as the starting index is 1. Additionally, the state of `i` at the beginning of the loop will be 1, which corresponds to the second element in the list. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the following conditions must be met:
- `lst` must have at least 2 integers,
- `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
