Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem, the function should check whether every odd index in the given list contains odd numbers. However, the function fails to handle cases where the list has fewer than 2 integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior, as indicated in the comments. 

Additionally, while the function correctly identifies even numbers at odd indices, the assertion tests provided suggest that the expected output for some cases might not align with the description's requirements. For example:

- In the case of the input `[4, 1, 2]`, the function will return `True` because the odd index (1) contains the number `1`, which is indeed odd. However, the number at the odd index should not just be odd; the function should also confirm that all odd indexed numbers in the entire list are odd, which it does not do properly since it only checks one odd index.

Furthermore, if the input list has fewer than 2 integers, the function does not explicitly handle these cases, which could lead to unreliable results.

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements as stated in the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
