The provided Python function `func_1` is supposed to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. 

**Initial Assessment:**
The logic of the function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks if the number at that index is even. If it finds an even number at any odd index, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at the odd indices, it returns `True`. 

However, the function does not handle cases where the list contains fewer than 2 integers. According to the problem description, the function needs to check that for all odd indices, the values must be odd, and it should also consider lists with fewer than 2 integers.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints clarify that the function returns `False` if any integer at an odd index is even. They also mention that if all integers at odd indices are odd and the list contains at least 2 integers, it returns `True`. However, they indicate that the function does not handle cases with fewer than 2 integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

**Conclusion:**
The hints agree with the code that it correctly checks for odd indices in general but fail to mention how the function behaves with insufficient list length. Given that the problem description is not adhered to in all cases (specifically for lists with fewer than 2 integers), the function is incorrect.

Furthermore, for a list with a length of 1 (e.g., `[2]`), the function would return `True`, which is incorrect because it does not contain enough elements to check an odd index.

Correctness: **False**.
