#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, if there is any odd indexed element in `lst` that is even, the function will return False; otherwise, the function will not return False and will finish executing.
    return True
    #The program returns True if there are no even elements at odd indices in the list 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `False` if any element at an odd index is even. If there are no even elements at odd indices, it returns `True`.
