To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions and variables involved in the for loop.

1. The loop iterates over the variable `i` which starts from 1 and increments by 2 each time until it reaches `len(lst)`. 
2. Since `i` is currently 3, the next value of `i` will be 5 (3 + 2).
3. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(lst)`. Given that `lst` is a list of integers containing at least 4 integers, `len(lst)` must be at least 4.
4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(lst)`. Since `i` will be 5 in the next iteration, `len(lst)` must be at least 6 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, we can summarize the current state and what needs to be adjusted:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers containing at least 6 integers, `i` is 5, and the integer at index `i` of `lst` is at least 3 (if `i` is in bounds).**
