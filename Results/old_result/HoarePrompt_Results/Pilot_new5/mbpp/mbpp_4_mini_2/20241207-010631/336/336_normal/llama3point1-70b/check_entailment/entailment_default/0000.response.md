To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description and the output hints, we will analyze both the code and the hints thoroughly.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to check if every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. 

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function iterates over the indices of the list.
2. For each index, it checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
3. If the index is odd and the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), it returns `False`.
4. If it finishes checking all indices without returning `False`, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases:
- An empty list should return `True` because there are no odd indices.
- A list with only one element should return `True` since there are no odd indices.
- A list with odd indices where all odd indexed elements are odd should return `True`.
- A list with odd indices where at least one odd indexed element is even should return `False`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts a list of integers and returns `False` if any element at an odd index is even. If there are no even elements at odd indices, it returns `True`.

### Analysis:
The output hints agree with the code and its functionality. The function works as described:
- It correctly identifies when an element at an odd index is even and returns `False`.
- It returns `True` otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also corroborate the behavior of the code. There do not appear to be any edge cases or scenarios where the program deviates from the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**.
