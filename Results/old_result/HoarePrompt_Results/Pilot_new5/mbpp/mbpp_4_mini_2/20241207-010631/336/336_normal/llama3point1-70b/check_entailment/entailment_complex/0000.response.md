The provided program aims to check whether every odd index of a list contains odd numbers. 

Upon analyzing the code:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over each index of the list `lst`.
2. For each index `i`, it checks:
   - If `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
   - If the element at that odd index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
3. If both conditions are met, the function returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it returns `True`.

Now, let's compare this logic with the problem description:

- The function is supposed to ensure that **every odd index contains odd numbers**. This means that if an odd index (like 1, 3, 5, etc.) has an even number, the function should return `False`. 

- However, what the function actually does is check if any odd-indexed number is even and returns `False` immediately when it finds the first even number at any odd index, which is indeed correct for the requirement.

To summarize, the function correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True** 

This is because the function appropriately fulfills the condition that every odd index must contain an odd number, returning `False` if it finds any violation of that condition and `True` otherwise.
