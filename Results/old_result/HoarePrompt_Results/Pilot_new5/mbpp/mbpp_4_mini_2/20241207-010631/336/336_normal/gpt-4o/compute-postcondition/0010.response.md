To analyze the final state after the loop executes, we recognize the following points from the given code:

1. The loop iterates over the list `lst`, starting from index 1 and incrementing by 2 each time, checking every second integer.
2. The loop continues until the end of the list is reached, so the number of iterations depends on the length of `lst`.
3. The loop checks if the integer at the current index `i` is even; if it is, the function returns `False` immediately.
4. If the loop executes without returning, it means that all integers at the odd indices checked during the iterations are odd.

Now, considering the possible output states after all iterations of the loop:

- If the length of `lst` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute, and `lst` remains unchanged.
- If the loop executes fully (meaning it checks all relevant indices without returning), it implies that all integers at the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are odd.

Taking these into account, we summarize the output states:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers containing at least 2 integers, all integers at odd indices are odd, and if the length of `lst` is greater than 1, the loop has executed without returning False.**
