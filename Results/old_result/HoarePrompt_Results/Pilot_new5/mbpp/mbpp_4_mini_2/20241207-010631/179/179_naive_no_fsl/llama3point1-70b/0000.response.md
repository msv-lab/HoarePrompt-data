To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to ensure that it correctly calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

1. The first n even natural numbers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.
2. The cube of these numbers is calculated, and the sum of these cubes is what the function should return.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

- The function uses a generator expression to iterate through numbers from 2 to `n * 2`, with a step of 2, which correctly generates the first n even natural numbers.
- It calculates the cube of each of these even numbers (`i ** 3`) and sums them up using the `sum()` function.

Now, let's test a few cases:

1. **For n = 1**: The first even natural number is 2. The cube sum is \(2^3 = 8\).
   - The function returns `sum((2 ** 3))` which is 8. This is correct.

2. **For n = 2**: The first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
   - The function returns `sum((2 ** 3, 4 ** 3))`, which gives us 72. This is correct.

3. **For n = 3**: The first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
   - The function returns `sum((2 ** 3, 4 ** 3, 6 ** 3))`, which gives us 288. This is correct.

4. **For n = 0**: The function should ideally handle the case where n = 0. The sum of the first 0 even natural numbers is 0.
   - The function will return `sum()`, which is indeed 0. This is correct.

5. **For n < 0**: The function does not handle negative inputs. For instance, if n = -1, the range becomes `range(2, 0, 2)`, which is invalid and results in an empty sum.
   - The function would return 0, which is not a correct output for the task as defined.

Therefore, the function does not account for cases where n is negative and gives a misleading output (0) instead of raising an error or returning a more appropriate response.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program incorrectly handles negative values of n, resulting in an output that does not match the expectations set by the problem description.
