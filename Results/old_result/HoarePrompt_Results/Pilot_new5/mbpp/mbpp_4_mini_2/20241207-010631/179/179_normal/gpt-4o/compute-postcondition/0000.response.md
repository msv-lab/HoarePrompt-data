The `even_numbers` list is created by multiplying each integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` by 2. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, the range will include values from 1 to `n`, resulting in a list of the first `n` even numbers.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `even_numbers` is a list containing the first `n` even numbers.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `even_numbers` is a list containing the first `n` even numbers (i.e., `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]`).**
