Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` computes the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding Even Natural Numbers**: The first `n` even natural numbers are `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`. 

2. **Cubes of Even Natural Numbers**: The cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers would be calculated as `2^3, 4^3, 6^3, ..., (2n)^3`.

3. **Implementation Detail**: 
   - The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates the list of even numbers starting from `2` up to `2n` (inclusive), by incrementing by `2`.
   - The expression `i ** 3` computes the cube of each even number.
   - The `sum()` function adds these cubes together.

4. **Functionality**: For every non-negative integer `n`, the function accurately targets and sums the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers as required.

Thus, the program fulfills all requirements of the problem description.
