To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

**Problem Description:**
The function must find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

**Annotated Program Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1(n)` takes a non-negative integer `n`.
2. It generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using the list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. The output of this line will be:
   - If `n = 1`, the output will be `[2]`
   - If `n = 2`, the output will be `[2, 4]`
   - If `n = 3`, the output will be `[2, 4, 6]`
   - If `n = 4`, the output will be `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
3. The function calculates the sum of the cubes of these numbers using the generator expression: `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
4. Finally, it returns `cube_sum`.

**Verification of the Outputs:**
- For `func_1(2)`: 
  - The first two even numbers are `[2, 4]`.
  - The cubes are `2^3 = 8` and `4^3 = 64`, giving a sum of `8 + 64 = 72`.
  
- For `func_1(3)`: 
  - The first three even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`.
  - The cubes are `2^3 = 8`, `4^3 = 64`, and `6^3 = 216`, giving a sum of `8 + 64 + 216 = 288`.
  
- For `func_1(4)`: 
  - The first four even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
  - The cubes are `2^3 = 8`, `4^3 = 64`, `6^3 = 216`, and `8^3 = 512`, giving a sum of `8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It properly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, including the case when `n` is 0 (returns 0).

Correctness: **True**
