Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

Here's why the program is correct:
1. The function uses the `range` function starting from `2` (the first even natural number) to `n * 2 + 1` with a step of `2`, which generates the first `n` even natural numbers.
2. It then computes the cube of each of these even numbers using a generator expression and sums them up using the `sum` function.
3. The program will correctly handle any non-negative integer input for `n`, including `0`.

For example:
- If `n = 0`, the output will be `0` as there are no even numbers to sum.
- If `n = 1`, the output will be `2^3 = 8`.
- If `n = 2`, the output will be `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`.
- If `n = 3`, the output will be `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`.

In all cases, the program adheres to the problem description and produces the correct result. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
