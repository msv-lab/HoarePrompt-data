The problem description requires a function to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The provided program calculates this by summing the cubes of all even integers from 2 to `2*n`, inclusive.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

### Initial Assessment:
- The function generates even numbers using `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`, which correctly generates even numbers starting from 2 up to and including `2*n` for `n > 0`.
- The sum of cubes is calculated correctly with `sum((i ** 3 for i in ...))`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `n = 0`:** According to the problem description, the function should return 0 since there are no even integers to sum. The function does handle this correctly because `range(2, 0 + 1, 2)` will produce an empty range, resulting in a sum of 0.
2. **When `n = 1`:** The function should sum the cubes of `2`, which equals `2^3 = 8`.
3. **When `n = 2`:** The function should sum the cubes of `2` and `4`, yielding `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`.
4. **When `n = 3`:** The function should sum the cubes of `2, 4, 6`, yielding `8 + 64 + 216 = 288`.

From these edge cases, it seems the function behaves correctly according to the problem description.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the function:
- Accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
- Returns the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 to `2*n`, inclusive.
- If `n` is 0, it returns 0, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
After considering the problem description, the implementation, and output hints, it appears the code meets the requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, handles the edge case when `n = 0`, and sums the cubes appropriately for any positive `n`.
