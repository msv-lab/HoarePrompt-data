The provided program is a function designed to determine whether a given integer is odd. The description states that it should identify the parity of a number, specifically returning `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. 

Looking at the code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
```

The function checks if the remainder of `n` when divided by 2 is not equal to zero. This correctly identifies odd numbers (as they yield a remainder of 1) and even numbers (which yield a remainder of 0). 

Next, I will consider potential edge cases. The typical edge cases for parity checks would include negative numbers, zero, and very large integers. In all these cases, the modulo operation behaves consistently:

- For `n = 0`, `0 % 2` equals `0`, so the function returns `False`, which is correct since 0 is even.
- For negative odd numbers (for example, `n = -3`), `-3 % 2` equals `-1`, and therefore the function returns `True`, which is correct.
- For negative even numbers (for example, `n = -4`), `-4 % 2` equals `0`, and the function returns `False`, which is also correct.

Now, examining the output hints:

"The function accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd, and `False` if `n` is even."

This statement aligns perfectly with the code functionality. Both the output hints and the code confirm that the function behaves as required by the problem description.

Since I cannot identify any input cases where the program does not work as stated in the description, and because the hints confirm the code's behavior accurately, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function accurately checks the parity of any integer input and consistently returns the expected results.
