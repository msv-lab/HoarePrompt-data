The code provided for the problem description correctly identifies whether the parity of a given integer is odd. The function `func_1(n)` uses the modulus operator to check if the number is not divisible by 2. If `n % 2 != 0`, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is odd; otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is even.

Next, I consider the output hints, which state that the function accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. The hints also mention that the function does not handle any potential edge cases because it assumes `n` is always an integer.

The function indeed works correctly for all provided test cases (12, 7, and 10) and accurately reflects the problem description. However, the hints state that it does not handle potential edge cases, which implies that it might not properly deal with non-integer inputs (like strings or floats). For instance, if a string or a float were passed to the function, it would raise a TypeError instead of gracefully handling the input. 

This means that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when dealing with non-integer inputs. Since the function assumes `n` is always an integer and does not validate the input type, it could lead to incorrect behavior for those cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where `n` is not an integer, which is a potential edge case that could lead to incorrect results or errors when such inputs are provided.
