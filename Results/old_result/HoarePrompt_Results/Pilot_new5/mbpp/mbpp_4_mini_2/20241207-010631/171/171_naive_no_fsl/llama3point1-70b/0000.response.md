Correctness: **True**

The program correctly evaluates whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. It uses the expression `n % 2 != 0`, which checks if the remainder when dividing `n` by 2 is not equal to zero. This condition accurately identifies odd numbers, as odd numbers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

For example:
- For `n = 1`, `1 % 2` equals `1`, so the function returns `True`.
- For `n = 2`, `2 % 2` equals `0`, so the function returns `False`.
- For negative odd numbers like `n = -3`, `-3 % 2` equals `-1`, so the function returns `True`.

There are no edge cases or scenarios where this logic fails to accurately determine whether the number is odd. Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
