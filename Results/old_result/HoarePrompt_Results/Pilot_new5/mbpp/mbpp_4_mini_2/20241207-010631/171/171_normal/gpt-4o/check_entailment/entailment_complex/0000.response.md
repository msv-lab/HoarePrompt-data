Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of the integer `n` is odd by returning `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., when `n % 2 != 0`) and returning `False` if `n` is even. 

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the test cases:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True`, which is correct because 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False`, which is correct because 10 is even.

The function is designed to handle integers, and the comments indicate that it assumes `n` is always an integer, aligning with the problem description. Thus, it meets the requirements of accurately determining the odd parity of a number.
