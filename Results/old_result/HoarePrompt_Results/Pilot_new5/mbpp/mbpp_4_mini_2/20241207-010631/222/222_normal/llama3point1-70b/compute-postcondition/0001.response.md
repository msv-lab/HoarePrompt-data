According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will execute at least once, and `char` will be the first character of the string. Since `result` is initialized as an empty string, it does not affect whether the loop will run. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must not be an empty string, `char` will be the first character of `s`, and there will be no iterations yet, so we can assume any initial state for `char`.

State: **`s` must not be an empty string, `result` is an empty string, `char` is the first character of `s`**
