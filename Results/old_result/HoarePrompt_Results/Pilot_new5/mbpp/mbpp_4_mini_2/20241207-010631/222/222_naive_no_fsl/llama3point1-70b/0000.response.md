Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but instead, it only collects and returns uppercase characters. For instance, given the input string `"HelloWorld"`, the expected output should be `""` (removing all lowercase letters results in an empty string), but the program returns `"HW"`, which does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Additionally, if the input is `"abcde"`, which contains only lowercase characters, the expected output should be `""`, but the program would return `""`, which is correct in this case, but it is still not addressing the requirement of removing lowercase substrings from the input string as a whole.

Thus, since there is a contradiction between what the problem asks for and what the code achieves, the code is incorrect.
