Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, it only constructs a string containing uppercase characters. 

For example, if we input the string "HelloWorld", the expected output according to the problem description should be "HW", since "ello" and "orld" are lowercase substrings. However, the function will return "HW", which may be mistakenly interpreted as correct for the stated problem but does not actually remove lowercase substringsâ€”it only retains uppercase letters.

Another case to consider would be an empty string. The expected output should also be an empty string, which the function does handle correctly, but this does not align with the fundamental requirement of removing lowercase substrings throughout the string.

Thus, since the function does not correctly implement the required logic to remove lowercase substrings, it is incorrect.
