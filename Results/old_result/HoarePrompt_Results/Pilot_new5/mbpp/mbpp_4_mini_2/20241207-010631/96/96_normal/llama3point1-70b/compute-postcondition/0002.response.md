Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are of the same data type. If the tuple contains elements of varying data types, it returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where the tuple is empty, but logically should return `True` since there are no differing types.**
