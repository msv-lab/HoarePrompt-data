Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function `func_1(tup)` works as follows:

1. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`, which is consistent with the notion that all elements (none in this case) are of the same type.
2. It retrieves the type of the first element in the tuple and stores it in `first_type`.
3. It iterates over each element in the tuple, comparing its type to `first_type`. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it returns `True`, indicating all elements are of the same type.

The assertions provided in the program correctly test the function against various cases:
- A tuple of integers returns `True`, which is expected.
- A tuple containing both integers and a string returns `False`, which is also correct.
- Another tuple of integers again returns `True`.

There are no missing edge cases or unexpected behavior identified upon reviewing the implementation. The logic covers all potential scenarios, including the case of an empty tuple. Therefore, the function behaves as required by the problem description.
