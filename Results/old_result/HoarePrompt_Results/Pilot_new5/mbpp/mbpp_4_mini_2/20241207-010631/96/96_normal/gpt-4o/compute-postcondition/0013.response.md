Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple containing at least 3 elements, `first_type` is the type of the first element of `tup`, and `element` is the third element of `tup`. If the type of `element` is not equal to `first_type`, the function returns False. If the type of `element` is equal to `first_type`, the function executes without returning any value.***
