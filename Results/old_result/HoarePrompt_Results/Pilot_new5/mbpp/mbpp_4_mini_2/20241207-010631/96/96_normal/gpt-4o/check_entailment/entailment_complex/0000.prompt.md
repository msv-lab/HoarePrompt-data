You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing elements of any type.
def func_1(tup):
    if (not tup) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`tup` is a tuple containing elements of any type, and `tup` is not empty.
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a tuple containing elements of the same type, `first_type` is the type of the elements in `tup`, and all elements in `tup` are of type `first_type`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating a successful execution without any conditions affecting the outcome
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and checks if all the elements within it are of the same type. It returns `True` if the tuple is empty or if all elements are of the same type; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle the case where the tuple contains elements of different types adequately, as it only checks the first element's type against all others without any additional conditions for tuples of length 1 or empty tuples.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
