Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It does this by creating a set of the types of each element in the tuple using a generator expression, and then checking if the length of that set is 1. If the length is 1, it indicates that all elements are of the same type, while a length greater than 1 means that there are different types present.

For all potential cases:
1. An empty tuple returns `True` since there are no elements to compare types.
2. A tuple with a single element (e.g., `(1,)`) also returns `True` because the single element's type is consistent.
3. A tuple with multiple elements of the same type (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`) correctly returns `True`.
4. A tuple with elements of different types (e.g., `(1, 'string', 3.0)`) correctly returns `False`.

No edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the problem description have been identified. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
