Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It first checks if the tuple is empty, in which case it returns `True` since there are no differing types. For non-empty tuples, it stores the type of the first element and iterates through all elements, comparing their types to the stored type. If it finds a mismatch, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the tested cases, and I can't find any potential edge cases where the logic fails. Therefore, the implementation meets the problem requirements correctly.
