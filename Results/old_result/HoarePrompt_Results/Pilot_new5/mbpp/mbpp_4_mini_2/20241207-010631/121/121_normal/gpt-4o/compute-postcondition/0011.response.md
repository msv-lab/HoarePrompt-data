The value of `S_next` is assigned the result of `2 * S1 + S0`. Given that `S1` is 7 and `S0` is 3, we can compute `S_next` as follows:

```
S_next = 2 * 7 + 3
        = 14 + 3
        = 17
```

Thus, `S_next` is updated to 17. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
