According to the code, the loop is a `while True`, which means it will continue executing indefinitely unless interrupted by a break statement or an external condition. Therefore, it can proceed to the next iteration without any adjustments needed to the program state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is either 2 or 3; `num` is 9.**
