To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it in the context of the problem description, which is to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

The first function, `func_1(n)`, checks if a number is prime. It correctly identifies prime numbers by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number. Therefore, this function works as expected.

The second function, `func_2(n)`, is supposed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The logic in this function is as follows:
1. It starts by returning 7 for the first prime.
2. It counts up from 7, checking each number for primality using `func_1`.
3. It checks if the prime number found is of the form `6k ± 1` (which includes checking if `num % 6` equals 1 or 5).
4. It increments a counter each time it finds such a prime and returns the nth one when the count matches `n`.

However, there is a flaw in this implementation. The function does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1. For example, if `n = 0`, the function would enter an infinite loop because it will never reach the condition to return a value. This case illustrates that the program does not adequately handle all potential inputs.

Therefore, since there is at least one case (when `n` is less than 1) where the program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
