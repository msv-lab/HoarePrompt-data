The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is equal to 0 or 1, the function returns 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the value of S1 from the last iteration, which is derived from the previous calculations involving S0 and S_next. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 1 if `n` is 0 or 1; otherwise, it returns the value of S1 from previous calculations when `n` is greater than 1.  
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns 1 if n is 0 or 1; if n is greater than 1, it returns the value of S1 from the last iteration based on previous calculations.**
