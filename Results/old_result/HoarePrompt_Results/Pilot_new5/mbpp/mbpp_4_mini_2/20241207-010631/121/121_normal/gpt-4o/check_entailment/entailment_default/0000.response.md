To assess the correctness of the provided program and its alignment with the problem description, let's first break down the functionality required by the problem description and compare it with the provided code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. It mentions returning 1 for the cases where `n` is 0 or 1, indicating base cases, and a sequence generation for `n` greater than 1.

### Analyzing the Code:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1
```

1. For inputs `n = 0` and `n = 1`, the function correctly returns `1`.
2. For `n > 1`, the function uses a loop to calculate the next values based on the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`.
3. The loop iterates from `2` to `n`, generating new values for `S0` and `S1`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the function calculates values based on the recurrence relation and returns `S1` after processing the loop. They do mention the initial conditions, which align with the code logic.

### Edge Cases:
While the function correctly implements the base cases and attempts to generate the sequence, the problem description does not clarify the expected outputs for `n > 1` (specifically, what the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers should be). The code seems to be generating a sequence based on a recurrence relation, but it does not guarantee that the generated sequence corresponds to Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. 

### Potential Edge Case:
- The function does not validate whether the generated sequence indeed corresponds to actual Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. It simply calculates numbers based on the recurrence relation without ensuring these numbers are prime or even what is known as Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

Therefore, while the function returns values for given inputs, it does not necessarily align with the requirements of generating the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. This is a fundamental flaw because it may produce incorrect values for inputs greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
The logic does not fully adhere to the problem description for all potential cases, particularly for `n > 1`, as it does not guarantee that the output corresponds to the correct primes specified.

Correctness: **False**.
