The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 1 to 2. The values of `n`, `num`, and other properties remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 7; the result of calling `func_1(num)` is true; the value of `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5.**
