You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, as n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0 and the current value of n is less than 2
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to the integer square root of `n`. If the loop completes without returning False, `n` is a prime number.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that n is a prime number, as it passed the conditions where i is at least 2 and less than or equal to the integer square root of n, completing the loop without returning False.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns the integer 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1.
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `num` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies `func_1(num)` and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, `count` is equal to `n`, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
