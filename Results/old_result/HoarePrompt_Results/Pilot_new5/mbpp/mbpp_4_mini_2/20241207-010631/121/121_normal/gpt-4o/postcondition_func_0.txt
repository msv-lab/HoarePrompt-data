The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1. If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates and returns the value of `S1` from the last iteration of a loop where `S0` and `S1` are updated based on the previous values. The calculation involves the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, which generates a sequence based on the input `n`.
