According to the code, the for loop will iterate starting from 2 up to and including `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, which aligns with the given condition that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1. The loop variable `i` will take values from 2 to `n`, starting with `i` being 2 in the first iteration. 

Since `S0` and `S1` are initialized to 1, they don't affect the loop's ability to execute, as they are not utilized as loop control variables. However, since the loop starts with `i` at 2, it is necessary to indicate that at the start of the loop, `i` should be set to 2.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2**
