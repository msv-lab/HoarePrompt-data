After executing the code `S0, S1 = S1, S_next`, the variables `S0` and `S1` are updated. 

- The value of `S1` is assigned to `S0`, which was previously 1, so now `S0` becomes 1. 
- The value of `S_next`, which is 3, is assigned to `S1`, so now `S1` becomes 3.

The other variables `n`, `i`, and `S_next` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is: 
`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**.
