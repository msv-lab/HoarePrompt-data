Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take in two parameters: `tup`, which is intended to be a tuple, and `element`, which can be of any data type.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function uses the `.count()` method from Python's tuple data type, which accurately counts how many times the given `element` appears in `tup`.

3. **Handling of Cases**: The program correctly handles the cases where:
   - The `element` is not present in the tuple (returns 0).
   - The `element` appears multiple times in the tuple (returns the correct count).
   - The function works with various data types for `element`, as tuples can contain mixed types.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code check the function against specific cases, confirming that it returns expected results for given inputs.

Thus, the function behaves as required by the problem description: it counts and returns the occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. Therefore, the program is correct.
