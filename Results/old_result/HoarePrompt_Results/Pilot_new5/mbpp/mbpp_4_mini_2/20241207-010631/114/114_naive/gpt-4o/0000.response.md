Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of the specified element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method, which works as intended. Given the problem description, the function handles the following cases:

1. It returns `0` when the element is not present in the tuple (as shown in the first assertion).
2. It correctly counts and returns the number of occurrences for elements that are present in the tuple (as demonstrated in the second and third assertions).

Since the assertions provided test various scenarios, including the cases where the element occurs multiple times and where it doesn't occur at all, and since the code handles these cases correctly, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
