Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple (`tup`) and an element (`elem`), and it returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in `tup` using the `count` method of the tuple, which is designed for this specific purpose. 

Here's why the program always meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a tuple and an element as inputs, which aligns with the problem description.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The `count` method of the tuple is used to determine how many times `elem` appears in `tup`. This directly addresses the task of counting occurrences, as specified.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns an integer representing the count of occurrences, which is the expected output based on the problem description.

Since it accurately counts the occurrences of any element in a tuple as required, the program is correct.
