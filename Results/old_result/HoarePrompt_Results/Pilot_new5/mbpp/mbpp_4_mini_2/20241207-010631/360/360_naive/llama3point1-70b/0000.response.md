To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether it successfully returns the list from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
```

### Analysis:
1. The function uses the `max()` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which means it looks for the sublist with the highest sum.
2. The input `lists` is expected to be a list of lists.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- If `lists` is empty, the `max()` function will raise a `ValueError`. This is because `max()` needs at least one element to operate on, and an empty list does not satisfy that condition.
- If there are multiple sublists with the same highest sum, `max()` will return the first one it encounters, which is acceptable according to the problem description.
- If the sublists contain non-numeric types, the sum function will raise a `TypeError`.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle the case of an empty input list gracefully, and as such, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails when the input is an empty list, as it would raise an exception instead of providing a valid output.
