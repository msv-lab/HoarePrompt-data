The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` will now hold that specific sublist. The values of `current_sum` and `max_sum` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this assignment. Other variables, such as `list_of_lists`, continue to retain their original information.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 3 sublists; `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`; `current_sum` is the sum of all elements in `sublist`; `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`; `max_list` is equal to `sublist`.**
