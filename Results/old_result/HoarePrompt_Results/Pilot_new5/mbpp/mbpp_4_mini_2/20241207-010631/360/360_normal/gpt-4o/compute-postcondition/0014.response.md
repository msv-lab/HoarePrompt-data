The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of `sublist`, which is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`. The value of `current_sum` will be equal to the sum of all elements in `sublist`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 3 sublists; `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 3 sublists; `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is the sum of all elements in `sublist`.**
