Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (either integers or floats), and returns the inner list that has the highest sum of its numerical elements. If the input list is empty, the behavior of the function is not explicitly defined, and it may raise a ValueError due to the `max` function being called on an empty iterable. **
