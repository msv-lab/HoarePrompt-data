#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (integers or floats).
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns the inner list from 'lists' that has the highest sum of its numerical elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (either integers or floats), and returns the inner list that has the highest sum of its numerical elements. If the input list is empty, the behavior of the function is not explicitly defined, and it may raise a ValueError due to the `max` function being called on an empty iterable.
