According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. As stated, `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, which allows the loop to iterate at least once. At the end of the last iteration, it is implied that the loop has processed the first sublist and can continue to the next. 

Since the loop variable `sublist` takes on the value of each sublist in `list_of_lists` one at a time, for the loop to execute one more time, the program must have already processed the first sublist and moved on to the next one.

If `list_of_lists` had at least one sublist originally, and assuming it has more than one, after processing the current sublist, the loop will proceed to the next sublist. 

To summarize:
- `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 sublists for the loop to execute once more.
- The loop will now be looking at the second sublist.
  
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 2 sublists, sublist is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`**.
