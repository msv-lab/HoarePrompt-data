According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 3 sublists, the loop executes again for the third sublist. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in the list, and `current_sum` is already calculated for that sublist. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `list_of_lists` must have at least 3 sublists. After the second iteration, the loop moves to the next sublist. Therefore, `sublist` will refer to the third sublist in `list_of_lists`.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` must be calculated for the third sublist.**
