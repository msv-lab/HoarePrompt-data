Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list, `lists`, is empty. According to the problem description, the function should return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. However, if the input is an empty list, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `max` function cannot operate on an empty iterable.

Since the function's behavior is not defined for an empty input list, it does not fully meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.
