Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to count the occurrences of the substring 'std' within a given string using the `count` method. The `str.count()` method is designed to count all non-overlapping occurrences of a substring, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

The implementation will correctly handle various cases, such as:
- If the string does not contain 'std' at all (e.g., `func_1("hello world")` returns 0).
- If 'std' appears multiple times (e.g., `func_1("std std std")` returns 3).
- If 'std' appears at the beginning or end of the string (e.g., `func_1("stdabc")` returns 1).
- If 'std' is part of another word (e.g., `func_1("standard")` returns 0 because 'std' is not a standalone occurrence).

Since there are no edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
