Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string using the built-in `count` method of strings in Python. This method accurately counts overlapping and non-overlapping occurrences. Therefore, for any input string, the function will return the correct number of times 'std' appears in it, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. Since the logic is sound and there are no identified edge cases where it would fail, the program is deemed correct.
