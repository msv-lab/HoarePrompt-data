Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which requires counting the occurrences of the substring 'std' within a given string. 

Here's an explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` takes a single string argument `s`.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: Inside the function, it uses the built-in string method `count` to count how many times the substring 'std' appears in `s`. The `count` method is specifically designed to return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring in a string, which directly aligns with the requirements of the problem description.
3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test various scenarios:
   - `'letstdlenstdporstd'` contains 'std' three times, and the assertion validates this.
   - `'truststdsolensporsd'` contains 'std' once, which is also validated.
   - `'makestdsostdworthit'` contains 'std' twice, confirmed by the assertion.
   - `'stds'` contains 'std' once, matching the assertion.
   - An empty string `''` has zero occurrences of 'std', which is correctly validated by the assertion.

Since the function consistently counts the occurrences of 'std' in various test cases as required by the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.
