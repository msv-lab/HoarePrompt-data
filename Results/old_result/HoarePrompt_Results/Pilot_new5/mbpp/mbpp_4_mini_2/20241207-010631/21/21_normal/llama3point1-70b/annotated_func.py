#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of numbers.
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers (`nums`) and returns the minimum value from that list. However, if the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` since the `min()` function cannot operate on an empty sequence.
