#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of numbers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'lst' of numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` of numbers and returns the minimum value from that list. However, it does not handle cases where `lst` is empty, which would raise a ValueError. Therefore, the function assumes that the input list will always contain at least one number.
