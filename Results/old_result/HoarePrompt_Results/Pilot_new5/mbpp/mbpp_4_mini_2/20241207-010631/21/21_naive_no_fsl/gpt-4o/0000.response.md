Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function `func_1(lst)` which returns the smallest number in a list. The use of the built-in `min()` function is appropriate and should work for any non-empty list of numbers.

The assertions verify the functionality with different lists:

1. `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`, which is indeed the smallest number.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `1`, which is correct.
3. `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` returns `45`, which is also correct.

The program does not handle an empty list case, but since the problem description does not mention handling this scenario, we assume that the list will always contain numbers. Therefore, the program meets the requirements given in the problem description. 

Overall, the implementation is correct for the specified use cases.
