The variable `sum` is assigned the value of its previous value plus `int(digit) ** num_len`. The value of `digit` can be assumed to be one of the characters in `num_str`, which is a non-empty string of characters representing digits. Since `num_len` must equal the length of `num_str`, `num_len` is a positive integer. Therefore, the new value of `sum` becomes its previous value plus the integer value of `digit` raised to the power of `num_len`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a non-empty string that must have at least one more character, `num_len` equals the length of `num_str`, `sum` is the previous value plus `int(digit) ** num_len.**
