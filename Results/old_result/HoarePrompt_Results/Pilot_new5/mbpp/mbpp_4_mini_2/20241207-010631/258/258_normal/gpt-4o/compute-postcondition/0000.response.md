`num_str` is assigned the string representation of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` will be a string that represents that integer value. The state of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`**
