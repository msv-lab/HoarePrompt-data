Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks if the given number is an Armstrong number, which is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

Here's how the program works:
1. It first converts the number `n` to a string to easily iterate through each digit.
2. It calculates the length of this string (`num_len`), which gives the number of digits in `n`.
3. It then computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` using a generator expression.
4. Finally, it returns `True` if this computed sum is equal to the original number `n`, and `False` otherwise.

The provided assertions test some known Armstrong numbers:
- `153` is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `259` is not an Armstrong number because \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 2 + 125 + 729 = 856\).
- `4458` is also not an Armstrong number because \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 = 4223\).

The function works correctly for these inputs, and I cannot think of any additional cases where it would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description. Thus, it correctly determines whether a number is an Armstrong number or not for all tested cases.
