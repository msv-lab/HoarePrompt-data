According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `num_str`. If `num_str` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` is a non-empty string, and `num_len` equals the length of `num_str`. Since `num_str` must have at least one more character for the loop to continue, `num_len` should be incremented by 1. The next character in `num_str` will be accessed by the loop, so we should consider the index of the character we are on.

Currently, since `num_str` must have at least one more character than `num_len` implies that `num_len` equals the length of `num_str` and there is at least one character remaining. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `num_str` must have at least `num_len + 1` characters.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a non-empty string that must have at least `num_len + 1` characters, `num_len` equals `length of num_str`, `sum` is the previous value plus `int(digit)`**
