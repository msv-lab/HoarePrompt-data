To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

The problem description states that we need to write a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a number of digits n is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of n.

Now, let's review the provided program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

### Analysis of the Function:
1. The function converts the input number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the number (i.e., how many digits it has).
3. It initializes a sum variable to 0.
4. It loops through each digit in the string representation of the number:
   - Each digit is converted back to an integer, raised to the power of the number of digits, and added to the sum.
5. Finally, it checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number and returns the result.

### Testing Edge Cases:

1. **Single-digit numbers (0-9)**:
   - These are all Armstrong numbers because any single digit raised to the power of 1 is itself. For example, for num = 5: `5 ** 1 = 5`. 
   - The function will correctly return `True` for all single-digit numbers.

2. **Two-digit numbers (e.g., 10, 11)**:
   - For num = 10: `1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1` (not equal to 10) → should return `False`.
   - For num = 11: `1^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (not equal to 11) → should return `False`.
   - The function correctly identifies that these are not Armstrong numbers.

3. **Three-digit numbers (e.g., 153)**:
   - For num = 153: `1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153` → should return `True`. The function will correctly return `True`.

4. **Negative numbers**:
   - For num = -1: The function will incorrectly attempt to evaluate `-1` as an Armstrong number. It will convert it to a string and calculate the length, leading to an erroneous comparison, as negative numbers cannot be Armstrong numbers.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle negative numbers correctly. For any negative input, the function will incorrectly evaluate and could return `False`, even though it should ideally not evaluate negative numbers at all.

Thus, since the function does not behave correctly for the case where the input number is negative, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
