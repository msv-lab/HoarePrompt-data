Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

2. **Conversion to String**: The program converts the number `n` into a string to easily iterate over each digit. This is a valid approach.

3. **Calculating Number of Digits**: The length of the string representation of the number, `num_len`, correctly determines how many digits are in `n`.

4. **Calculating the Armstrong Sum**: The program uses a generator expression to compute the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`, which is the central operation needed to check if `n` is an Armstrong number.

5. **Comparison**: The final return statement checks if the calculated sum (armstrong_sum) is equal to the original number `n`, which is exactly what the problem asks for.

6. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the program effectively test the function against known Armstrong numbers (153) and non-Armstrong numbers (259 and 4458), confirming that the function behaves as expected.

Thus, the function `func_1` meets the requirements set by the problem description, validating numbers as Armstrong numbers correctly for any non-negative integer input.
