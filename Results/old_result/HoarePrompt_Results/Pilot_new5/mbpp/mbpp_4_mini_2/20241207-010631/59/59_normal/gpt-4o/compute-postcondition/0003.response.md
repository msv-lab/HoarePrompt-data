The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. All three parameters are lists containing elements that can be compared to each other. After executing the function body, the function returns a single sorted list that contains all the elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists and return a sorted list that combines all the elements from those lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters list1, list2, and list3, and returns a single sorted list containing all elements from the three lists.**
