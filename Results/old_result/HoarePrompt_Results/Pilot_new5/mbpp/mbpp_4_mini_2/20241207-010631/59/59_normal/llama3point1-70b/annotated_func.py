#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all integers from list1, list2, and list3 combined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters, list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted list containing all integers from these lists combined. It does not handle any specific edge cases regarding empty lists or non-integer elements within the lists, but it will return a sorted result regardless of the lists' content as long as they contain integers.
