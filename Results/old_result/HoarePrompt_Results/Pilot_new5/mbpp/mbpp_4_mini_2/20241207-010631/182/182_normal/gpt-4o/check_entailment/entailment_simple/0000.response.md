Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and uses a list comprehension to extract the last character (rear index element) of each string in the tuple. The expression `s[-1]` efficiently accesses the last character of each string `s`. The list comprehension iterates over each string in the tuple `tup`, ensuring that the last character of each string is included in the result list.

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests to verify the correctness of the function for different input tuples. In each case, the function returns a list of the last characters, which matches the expected output as described in the problem statement. 

Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem description, correctly extracting the last character from each string in the tuple and returning them as a list.
