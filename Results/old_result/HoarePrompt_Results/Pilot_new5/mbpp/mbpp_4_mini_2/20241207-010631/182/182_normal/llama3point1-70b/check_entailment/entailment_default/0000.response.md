The code provided defines a function that extracts the last character of each string in a given tuple. 

Let's analyze the program and the problem description:

### Problem Description:
The function should extract the rear index (last character) of each string in the given tuple.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
```

### Initial Assessment:
The function uses list comprehension to iterate through each string `s` in the tuple `strings` and appends the last character `s[-1]` to a new list. This approach seems correct for non-empty strings. However, it does not account for the possibility of an empty string.

### Edge Cases:
1. If the tuple contains an empty string (e.g., `("", "hello")`), the code will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access `s[-1]` for the empty string.
2. If the tuple itself is empty (e.g., `()`) or consists solely of empty strings (e.g., `("", "")`), the code should ideally return an empty list or a list of empty strings, but instead, it will raise an `IndexError`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints clarify that the function accepts a tuple `strings` and returns a list of the last characters. It explicitly states that if any string in the tuple is empty, an `IndexError` will occur. This aligns with our initial assessment that the code does not handle empty strings.

### Conclusion:
Since the code does not handle cases where the strings in the tuple are empty, it fails to meet the problem's requirements for all potential inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not correctly handle the case when any string in the tuple is empty, leading to an `IndexError`.
