Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `strings` containing strings and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, it will result in an `IndexError` since the code does not handle the case of accessing the last character of an empty string. Therefore, edge cases include scenarios where the strings in the tuple may be empty.**
