The program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to return the last character of each string in the input tuple. However, the problem description implicitly assumes that all strings in the tuple will be non-empty. The function does not handle the case where any string in the tuple is empty, which would lead to an `IndexError` when attempting to access the last character of an empty string. This means that if an empty string is included in the input tuple, the function will fail, and thus it does not meet the requirements set out in the problem description for all potential cases.
