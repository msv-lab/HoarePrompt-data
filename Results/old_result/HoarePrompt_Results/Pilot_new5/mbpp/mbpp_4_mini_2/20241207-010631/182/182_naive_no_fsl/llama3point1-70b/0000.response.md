Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement of extracting the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` ensures that for each string `s` in the input `strings`, the last character is accessed using the index `-1`, which is a valid operation for non-empty strings. 

The program will handle typical cases as follows:
- For a tuple of strings like `("hello", "world")`, the output will be `['o', 'd']`, which correctly corresponds to the last characters of the strings.
- For an empty string in the tuple, such as `("hello", "", "world")`, the program will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the last character of an empty string.

However, the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle empty strings. Since an empty string does not have a rear index element, this results in an error, indicating that the program does not account for all potential cases.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement completely, leading to:

Correctness: **False** 

A specific case that demonstrates this is when the input is `("", "test")`, which will lead to an `IndexError` when accessing `s[-1]` for the empty string.
