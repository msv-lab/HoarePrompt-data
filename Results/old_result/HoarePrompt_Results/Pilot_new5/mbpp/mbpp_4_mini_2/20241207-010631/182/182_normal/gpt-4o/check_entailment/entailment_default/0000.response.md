The given problem description asks for a function that extracts only the last character from each string in a provided tuple. The provided program correctly implements this functionality by using a list comprehension to access the last character of each string in the tuple.

However, upon further inspection, it becomes evident that the code does not handle edge cases, specifically when one or more strings in the tuple are empty. Attempting to access the last character of an empty string would result in an `IndexError`, which is explicitly mentioned in the output hints.

The output hints accurately reflect this flaw, stating that the function will throw an error when encountering an empty string. This discrepancy indicates that the code does not adhere to the problem's requirements for all potential cases, as it fails to handle the scenario of empty strings gracefully.

Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, my final evaluation of the program's correctness is as follows:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case where any string in the tuple is empty, which would lead to an IndexError. For example, if the input tuple were `('', 'test', 'case')`, the function would attempt to access the last character of the empty string, resulting in an error.
