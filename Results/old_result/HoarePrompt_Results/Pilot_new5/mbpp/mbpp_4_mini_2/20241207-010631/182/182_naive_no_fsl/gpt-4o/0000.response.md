Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly extracts the last character (rear index element) of each string in the given tuple. The function `func_1` iterates through each string in the tuple and collects the last character using the index `-1`. 

The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function works as expected for the examples given:

1. For the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the output is `['s', 'r', 's']` which correctly captures the last characters of each string.
2. For the input `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, the output is `['e', 'r', 'e']`, again correctly identifying the last characters.
3. For the input `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, the output is `['a', 't', 'o']`, which is also accurate.

The function handles any tuple of strings, including varying lengths and characters. There are no edge cases in the provided examples that would cause the function to fail, such as empty strings or non-string elements. However, if it were to be tested with an empty tuple or a tuple containing empty strings, it would still function correctly, returning an empty list for an empty tuple and accumulating empty strings appropriately.

Therefore, I conclude that the program behaves as required in the problem description for all tested cases and scenarios.
