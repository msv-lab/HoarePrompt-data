Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. While it aims to extract the last character of each string in the given tuple, it fails to handle the case where any string in the tuple could be empty. If an empty string is encountered, the program will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the last character (using `s[-1]`), which contradicts the expectation of processing all given strings without causing an error.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirement of safely extracting the rear index element of each string, as it doesn't account for scenarios where strings may be empty.
