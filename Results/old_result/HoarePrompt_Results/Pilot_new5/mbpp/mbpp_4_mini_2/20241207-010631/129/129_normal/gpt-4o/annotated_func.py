#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode code point of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its Unicode code point as an integer. It does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string, which may lead to errors if the input is invalid.
