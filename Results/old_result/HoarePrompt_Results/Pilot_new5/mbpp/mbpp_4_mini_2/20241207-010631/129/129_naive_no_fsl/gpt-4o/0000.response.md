Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function to find the ASCII value of a character using the `ord()` function. The assertions test the function with valid uppercase characters ('A', 'R', 'S'), and they all return the expected ASCII values. 

Since the ASCII values for valid characters are correctly handled, and there is no indication of missing logic or edge cases that would cause the function to fail for valid characters, we can conclude that the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Additionally, the `ord()` function handles a wide range of characters, including all ASCII characters, so there are no cases of unexpected behavior for additional valid inputs such as lowercase letters or special characters. Therefore, the implementation is sound and adheres to the specifications given.
