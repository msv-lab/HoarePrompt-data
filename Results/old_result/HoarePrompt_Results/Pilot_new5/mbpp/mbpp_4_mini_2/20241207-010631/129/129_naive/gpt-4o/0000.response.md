Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly utilizes Python's built-in `ord` function to return the ASCII value of the given character. It has been tested with three valid input cases ('A', 'R', and 'S'), all of which return the expected ASCII values. The function will also correctly handle any single character input, including lowercase letters, digits, punctuation, and special characters, as `ord` is designed to return the ASCII (or Unicode) code point for any character. Therefore, there are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
