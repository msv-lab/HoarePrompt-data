#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ASCII value of the single character string 'char' obtained using the ord function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns the ASCII value of that character using the ord function. If `char` is not a single character string, it may raise a TypeError or a ValueError. The function does not handle such cases explicitly, so assuming valid input is necessary for correct operation.
