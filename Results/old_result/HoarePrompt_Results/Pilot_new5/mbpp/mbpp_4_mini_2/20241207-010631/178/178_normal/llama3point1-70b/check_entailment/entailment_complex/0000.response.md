Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The program rounds each number in the provided list using the `round()` function. This step satisfies the requirement to round every number in the list.

2. **Calculating Total Sum**: After rounding the numbers, the program calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers using the `sum()` function. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the sum of the rounded numbers must be computed.

3. **Multiplying by Length**: Finally, the program multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list using `len(numbers)`. This matches the requirement to multiply the sum by the length of the list.

4. **Handling Empty Lists**: The program handles the case of an empty list correctly. If `numbers` is empty, both the total sum and the length of the list will be zero. Therefore, the program will correctly return 0 in this case.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description in all scenarios, including edge cases such as an empty list. Thus, it can be concluded that the implementation is correct.
