#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of total_sum, which is equal to the sum of all elements in rounded_numbers, and the length of numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers (which can be integers or floats), rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the original list. If the list is empty, the function will return 0, since the length of an empty list is 0 and the total sum will also be 0.
