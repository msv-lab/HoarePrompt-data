#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of real numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the result which is equal to total_sum multiplied by the length of the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of real numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the total sum of these rounded integers, and then returns the product of this total sum and the length of the original list. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0 because the length of `numbers` will be zero, resulting in a product of 0 regardless of the sum.
