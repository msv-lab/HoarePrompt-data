The code creates a new list called `rounded_numbers`, where each element is the result of rounding the corresponding element in the `numbers` list. The original list `numbers` remains unchanged. The exact values in `rounded_numbers` depend on the specific values within `numbers`, but since `numbers` is a list of real numbers, `rounded_numbers` will contain the rounded integers of those values.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of real numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers rounded from `numbers`.**
