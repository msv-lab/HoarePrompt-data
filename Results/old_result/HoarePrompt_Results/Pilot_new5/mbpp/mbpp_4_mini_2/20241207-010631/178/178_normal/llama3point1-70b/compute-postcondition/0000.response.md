The code creates a new list `rounded_numbers` which contains the rounded values of each number in the `numbers` list. The values in `numbers` (which can be integers or floats) are transformed by applying the `round` function. The state of the `numbers` variable remains unchanged, but the new variable `rounded_numbers` reflects the rounded values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of the corresponding numbers in `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of the corresponding numbers in `numbers`.**
