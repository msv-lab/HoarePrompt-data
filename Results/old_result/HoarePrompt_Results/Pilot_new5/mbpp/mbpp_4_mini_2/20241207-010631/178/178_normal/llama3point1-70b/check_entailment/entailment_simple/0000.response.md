Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it consistently fulfills the task:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The program uses a list comprehension to round each number in the given list `numbers`. This is done through the expression `rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]`, which correctly applies the `round` function to every element in the list.

2. **Calculating the Total Sum**: After rounding the numbers, the program calculates the total sum of the rounded values with `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`. This step is correct as it aggregates all the rounded numbers.

3. **Multiplying by Length**: The final step of the function is to return the product of `total_sum` and the length of the original list with `return total_sum * len(numbers)`. This adheres to the problem requirements by ensuring that the sum of the rounded numbers is multiplied by the length of the original list of numbers.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and will handle any list of numbers (including integers and floats) as specified. Therefore, it is correct.
