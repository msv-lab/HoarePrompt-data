#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, and the list may contain any number of elements (including zero).
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns True if the list is sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it returns False. It correctly handles an empty list by returning True, as an empty list is considered sorted.
