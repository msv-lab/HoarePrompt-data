Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to check if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the list is empty or contains a single element. According to the problem description, a list that is empty or has one element should also be considered sorted, as there are no elements to compare. 

For example:
- If `lst` is an empty list `[]`, the function will run the for loop zero times and then return `True`, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description but can be argued as a reasonable interpretation of "sorted."
- If `lst` has a single element, say `[5]`, the for loop again runs zero times, and the function will return `True`, which also aligns with the interpretation of being sorted.

However, the annotations and the overall explanation of the function do not address these edge cases, which means it does not meet all potential requirements set forth in the problem description. 

Thus, the function lacks clarity on how it handles these edge cases and cannot be deemed correct without explicit handling or clarification regarding empty lists and single-element lists. This results in a conclusion that the program does not completely satisfy the problem description's requirements in all scenarios.
