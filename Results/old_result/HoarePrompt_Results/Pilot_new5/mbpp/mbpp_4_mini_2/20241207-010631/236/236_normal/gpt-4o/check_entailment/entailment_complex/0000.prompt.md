You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that are comparable to each other.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that must be sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, and the function does not return False if all comparisons are valid; otherwise, if any `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False, indicating the list is not sorted.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list 'lst' is sorted in non-decreasing order, since all comparisons are valid and no element 'lst[i]' is greater than 'lst[i + 1]'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` of elements that are comparable to each other and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns True if the list is sorted, and False if any element is greater than the subsequent element. The function does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or contains a single element, which would logically be considered sorted as well.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
