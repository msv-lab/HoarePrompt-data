Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` of elements that are comparable to each other and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns True if the list is sorted, and False if any element is greater than the subsequent element. The function does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or contains a single element, which would logically be considered sorted as well. **
