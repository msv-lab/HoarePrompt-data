The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of elements that are comparable to each other. The function checks the ordering of the elements in the list. 

- If the first element `lst[0]` is greater than the second element `lst[1]`, the function returns `False` indicating that the condition evaluated does not hold true. 
- Additionally, there are other cases where the function may return `False` without specifying the exact conditions leading to those cases.
- If all comparisons are valid and no element `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` of comparable elements and return `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, returns True if lst is sorted in non-decreasing order. If lst is not sorted, it returns False.**
