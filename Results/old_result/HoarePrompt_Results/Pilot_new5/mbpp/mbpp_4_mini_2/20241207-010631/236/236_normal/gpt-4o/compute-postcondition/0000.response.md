According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lst`. The range for the loop is determined by `len(lst) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, which means `lst` must contain at least 2 elements. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the first index of the range. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state must reflect that the list has at least 2 elements and that `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
