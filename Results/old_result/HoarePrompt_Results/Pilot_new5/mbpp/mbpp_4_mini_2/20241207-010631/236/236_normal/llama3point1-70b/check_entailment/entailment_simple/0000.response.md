Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to check whether a specified list is sorted. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a list called `nums` as an argument, which aligns with the problem description that states the function should operate on a list.

2. **Comparative Logic**: The function uses `sorted(nums)` to generate a new list that is the sorted version of `nums`. It then directly compares this sorted list with the original `nums`. If they are equal, this indicates that `nums` was already sorted in ascending order.

3. **Return Values**: The function returns `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise. This is exactly what is required by the problem description.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function appropriately handles edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with one element, since both are inherently sorted.

Thus, the program meets all aspects of the problem description effectively for all possible cases.
