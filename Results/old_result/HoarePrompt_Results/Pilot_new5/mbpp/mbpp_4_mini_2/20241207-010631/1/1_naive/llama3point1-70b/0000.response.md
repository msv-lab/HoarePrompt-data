Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly finds the shared elements between two lists by converting them to sets and using the set intersection operator (`&`). The result is returned as a tuple, which satisfies the problem description of finding shared elements. The program handles various cases, including:

1. **Empty Lists**: If either list is empty, the intersection will also be empty, and the function will return an empty tuple.
2. **No Shared Elements**: If there are no common elements between the two lists, the intersection will also yield an empty set, returning an empty tuple.
3. **Multiple Shared Elements**: The program will correctly identify and return all shared elements, regardless of their frequency in the input lists, since sets do not account for duplicates.
4. **Order of Elements**: The order of the shared elements in the resulting tuple is not guaranteed, which is acceptable given the problem description.

The implementation effectively covers all potential cases, and there are no identified edge cases where it would fail to perform as expected.
