The provided program aims to find the shared elements between two lists by converting them into sets and returning the intersection as a tuple. 

Looking at the function:

```python
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
```

This implementation correctly follows the problem description, as it takes two lists (denoted as `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) and computes the intersection of elements present in both lists. 

### Edge Cases Consideration:
1. **Empty Lists**: If both or either of the lists are empty, the intersection should correctly return an empty tuple, which the code handles.
2. **No Common Elements**: If there are no shared elements, the code will return an empty tuple, which is also as expected.
3. **Duplicate Elements**: The conversion to sets handles duplicates correctly, ensuring each shared element appears only once in the output tuple.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state:
- The function returns a tuple containing the intersection of the elements from the two lists.
- If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple.

These hints align with the implementation, confirming that the function behaves as described.

### Conclusion:
Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles various potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
