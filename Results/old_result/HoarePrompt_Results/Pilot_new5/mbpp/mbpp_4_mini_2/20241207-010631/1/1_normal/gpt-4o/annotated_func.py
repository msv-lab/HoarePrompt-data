#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists that may contain any type of elements.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements of `list1` and `list2`, as represented by the set `common_elements`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements found in both lists. If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple. The function does not handle cases where either input list is `None`, which could lead to a TypeError.
