To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we will analyze the function `func_1` to see if it meets the specified requirement of finding shared elements between two lists.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the shared elements from two given lists.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Type**: The function `func_1` accepts two inputs, `list1` and `list2`, which are defined as lists that may contain any type of elements. The use of tuples in the assertions (e.g., `(3, 4, 5, 6)`) is acceptable since tuples can be converted to sets in Python.

2. **Finding Common Elements**:
   - The main logic uses the intersection of sets: `set(list1) & set(list2)` which correctly identifies the common elements between the two input lists.
   - The result is then sorted and returned as a tuple using `tuple(sorted(common_elements))`. 

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test the function with different inputs and expect the correct common elements in the output:
   - For the input `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`, the common elements are indeed `(4, 5)`.
   - For `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 4, 3, 7)`, the common elements are `(3, 4)`.
   - For `(11, 12, 14, 13)` and `(17, 15, 14, 13)`, the common elements are `(13, 14)`.

### Conclusion:
The function successfully identifies the common elements from the two lists and returns them correctly. The use of sets to find intersections is an appropriate and efficient method to achieve the task, and returning the result as a sorted tuple meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True** 

The program adheres to the problem description since it correctly finds and returns the shared elements from the given lists, ensuring it covers the necessary requirements of the task.
