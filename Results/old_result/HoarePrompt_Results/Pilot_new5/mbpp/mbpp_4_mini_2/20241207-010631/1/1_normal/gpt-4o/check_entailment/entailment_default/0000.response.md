To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze them step by step.

### Problem Description:
The function is required to find the shared elements from two given lists and return those elements as a sorted tuple.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a tuple containing the sorted common elements found in both lists. If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple. The function does not handle cases where either input list is `None`, which could lead to a TypeError.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function converts both input lists into sets and uses the intersection operator (`&`) to find common elements.
2. It sorts these common elements and converts them back into a tuple format before returning.
3. The output hints state that if there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple, which aligns with the expected behavior of the intersection operation.

### Edge Cases:
1. The output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where either input list is `None`. If either `list1` or `list2` is `None`, attempting to convert it to a set will indeed raise a `TypeError`. This is a significant edge case that the function does not cover.

### Validation Against Output Hints:
- The output hints correctly describe the functionâ€™s behavior for valid lists and common elements.
- However, the hint regarding the `None` input case is critical. Since the function lacks error handling for `None` values, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, specifically when dealing with `None` inputs.

### Conclusion:
Given the critical edge case of handling `None` inputs, which the program does not account for, the program is incorrect. Even though it correctly finds common elements for valid lists, it fails to provide a robust solution for all potential input scenarios as described.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails when either `list1` or `list2` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.
