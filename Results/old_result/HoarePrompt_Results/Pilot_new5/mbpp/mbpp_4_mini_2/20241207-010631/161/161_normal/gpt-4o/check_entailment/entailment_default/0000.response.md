Initially, let's analyze the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem description:** The task is to find the n-th Lucas number. 
- The Lucas sequence is defined as:
  - L(0) = 2
  - L(1) = 1
  - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1(9) == 76  # This is the 9th Lucas number
assert func_1(4) == 7   # This is the 4th Lucas number
assert func_1(3) == 4   # This is the 3rd Lucas number

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

### Assessment of the Code
1. The function checks if `n` is 0 or 1 and returns the correct Lucas numbers for those cases.
2. For values of `n` greater than 1, it uses an iterative approach to calculate the n-th Lucas number by maintaining two variables, `a` and `b`, which represent the two previous numbers in the sequence.

### Edge Cases
- The code does not handle negative inputs. The problem description does not specify what should happen for negative integers, but it states that the input is expected to be a non-negative integer.
- If the function were called with a negative integer, it would not return any valid value, which is a potential issue.

### Output Hints
- The output hints say: "The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and returns the n-th Fibonacci number starting from 1 for all other values of `n` greater than 1." 
  - This statement is incorrect because it mentions Fibonacci numbers, which are distinct from the Lucas numbers. The Lucas numbers follow the same recurrence relation but start with different initial conditions.
  
Discrepancy in the output hints indicates that the hints may have confused the Lucas sequence with the Fibonacci sequence, leading to a misunderstanding of the function's purpose.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis:
- The code correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for non-negative integers.
- However, it does not handle negative numbers and assumes all input will be valid non-negative integers.
- The output hints incorrectly describe the function's behavior and purpose.

Because the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case (it fails for negative integers), the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The code does not specify any behavior for negative integers, which may lead to unexpected results if such inputs are provided.
