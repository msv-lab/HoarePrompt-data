The values of `a` and `b` are updated by the tuple assignment. Specifically, `b` takes the previous value of `b` (which is 3), and `a` takes the previous value of `a` (which is 1) added to the previous value of `b` (which is 3). Therefore, the new values will be `a = 1 + 3 = 4` and `b = 3`. The value of `n` and `_` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 4, `b` is 3, `_` is 3**
