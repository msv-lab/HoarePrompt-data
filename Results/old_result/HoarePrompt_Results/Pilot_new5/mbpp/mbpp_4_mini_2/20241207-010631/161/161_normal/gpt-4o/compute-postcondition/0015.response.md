The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns the integer 2. If `n` is equal to 1, it returns 1, which is the current value of `n`. If `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, the function returns `b`, which is the `n`-th Fibonacci number starting from 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return specific values based on its value, including 2 for `n` equal to 0, 1 for `n` equal to 1, and the `n`-th Fibonacci number for `n` greater than 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns 2 if n is 0, returns 1 if n is 1, and returns the n-th Fibonacci number if n is greater than 1.**
