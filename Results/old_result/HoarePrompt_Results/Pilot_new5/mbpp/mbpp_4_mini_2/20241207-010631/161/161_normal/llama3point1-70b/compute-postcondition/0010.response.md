The code assigns the values of `b` and `a + b` to `a` and `b`, respectively. The previous value of `a` is 1, and the previous value of `b` is 3. After executing the code, `a` will be assigned the value of `b` (which is 3), and `b` will be assigned the value of `a + b` (which is 1 + 3 = 4). The state of variable `_` remains unchanged, and `n` being greater than 2 remains valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, the loop variable `_` will be 3**
