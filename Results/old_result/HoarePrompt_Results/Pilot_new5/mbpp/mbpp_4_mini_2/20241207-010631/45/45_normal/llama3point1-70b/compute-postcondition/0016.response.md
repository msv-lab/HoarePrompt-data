The variable `undulating` is assigned the value `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `i` is `len(n) - 2`, and `undulating` is now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `i` is `len(n) - 2`, `undulating` is False**.
