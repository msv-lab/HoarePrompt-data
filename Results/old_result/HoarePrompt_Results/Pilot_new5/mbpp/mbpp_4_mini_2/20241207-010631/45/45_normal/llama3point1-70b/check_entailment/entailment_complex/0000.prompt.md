You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]:
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `undulating` is True if the digits of `n` form an undulating sequence, otherwise `undulating` is False after examining all relevant digits.
    return undulating
    #The program returns True if the digits of string representation 'n' form an undulating sequence, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the digits form an undulating sequence (alternating between increasing and decreasing). It returns `True` if the digits form such a sequence and `False` otherwise. The function requires that `n` has at least two digits to perform this check accurately. If `n` has fewer than two digits, the function will still return `True` as the loop will not run, which may not align with the expected behavior described in the annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
