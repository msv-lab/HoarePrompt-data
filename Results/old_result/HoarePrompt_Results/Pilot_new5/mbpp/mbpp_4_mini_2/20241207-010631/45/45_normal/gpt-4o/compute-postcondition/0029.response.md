Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if it has at least 3 digits. If it does not, it returns False. If it does, it checks that the first two digits are different and confirms that all characters in the string at even indices are equal to the first digit and all characters at odd indices are equal to the second digit. The function returns True only if all these conditions are satisfied; otherwise, it returns False. If the string representation of `n` has an even length, it will only validate characters against the first and second digits. **
