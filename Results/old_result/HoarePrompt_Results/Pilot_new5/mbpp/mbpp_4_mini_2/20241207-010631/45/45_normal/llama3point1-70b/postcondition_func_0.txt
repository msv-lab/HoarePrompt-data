The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the digits form an undulating sequence (alternating between increasing and decreasing). It returns `True` if the digits form such a sequence and `False` otherwise. The function requires that `n` has at least two digits to perform this check accurately. If `n` has fewer than two digits, the function will still return `True` as the loop will not run, which may not align with the expected behavior described in the annotations.
