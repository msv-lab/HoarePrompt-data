The value of `n` is converted to a string. Since `n` is a positive integer, after the execution, `n` will hold its string representation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, and now `n` is a string representation of that positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, now `n` is a string representation of that positive integer.**
