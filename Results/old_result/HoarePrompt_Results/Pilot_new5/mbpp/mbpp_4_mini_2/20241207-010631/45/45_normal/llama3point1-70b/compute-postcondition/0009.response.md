To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop's control variable `i` and the length of the string `n`. 

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
```
This means that `i` starts at 1 and will continue to iterate as long as it is less than `len(n) - 1`. The last value of `i` will be `len(n) - 2`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, which means that its length is at least 2 (and thus `len(n) - 1` is at least 1).
- `i` is the current index in the loop, which, at the end of the last iteration, is `len(n) - 2`.

To execute the loop one more time:
- `i` must increase by 1. Therefore, we will have `i` equal to `len(n) - 1`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` remains less than `len(n) - 1`, which means the loop will not execute again if `i` reaches `len(n) - 1` because the condition for the loop will not be satisfied.

Thus, for the loop to run one more time, we need to consider the next value of `i` and the condition that `i` must be less than `len(n) - 1`.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `undulating` is True, `i` is `len(n) - 1`**
