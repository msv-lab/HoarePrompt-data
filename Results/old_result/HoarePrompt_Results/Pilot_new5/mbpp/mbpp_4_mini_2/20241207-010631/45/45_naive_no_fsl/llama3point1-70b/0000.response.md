To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the problem description (to check if a number is undulating) and the implementation of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description: 
A number is said to be undulating if its digits alternate between increasing and decreasing. This implies that for any three consecutive digits, the middle digit should not be equal to its neighbors and should be either a peak or a valley.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` converts the input `n` into a string and initializes a variable `undulating` to `True`. It then iterates through the digits of the number (from the second digit to the second-to-last digit) and checks if either:
1. The sequence is increasing (the current digit is greater than the previous and the next digit).
2. The sequence is decreasing (the current digit is less than the previous and the next digit).

If neither condition is met, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks the loop.

### Potential Issues:
1. The function does not handle edge cases where the length of `n` is less than 3. For instance, single-digit numbers or two-digit numbers should be considered undulating because there are not enough digits to define a peak or valley.
2. The condition checks do not account for situations where digits can be equal, which is against the undulating definition.

### Test Cases:
- **Case 1:** `n = 121`
  - Expected: `True` (it alternates)
  - Actual: `True` (correct)

- **Case 2:** `n = 123`
  - Expected: `False` (not undulating)
  - Actual: `False` (correct)

- **Case 3:** `n = 212`
  - Expected: `True` (it alternates)
  - Actual: `True` (correct)

- **Case 4:** `n = 1`
  - Expected: `True` (single-digit is considered undulating)
  - Actual: `False` (incorrect, since it doesn't handle this case)

- **Case 5:** `n = 22`
  - Expected: `True` (two-digit is considered undulating)
  - Actual: `False` (incorrect, since it doesn't handle this case)

- **Case 6:** `n = 1213`
  - Expected: `True` (it alternates)
  - Actual: `True` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The function fails to account for single-digit and two-digit numbers. Thus, there are cases where the function does not behave as expected.

Correctness: **False**
