Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits. If `n[i - 1]` is less than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is less than `n[i + 1]`, or if `n[i - 1]` is greater than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is greater than `n[i + 1]`, then `undulating` remains True. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
