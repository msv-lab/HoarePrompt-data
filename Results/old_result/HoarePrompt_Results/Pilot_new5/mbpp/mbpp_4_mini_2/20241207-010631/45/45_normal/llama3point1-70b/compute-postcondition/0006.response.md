Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer that has at least 2 digits, `i` is 1, `undulating` is False. The character at the index `i` (i.e., `n[1]`) is not part of an undulating sequence with its adjacent characters, meaning either `n[0] <= n[1]` and `n[1] >= n[2]`, or `n[0] >= n[1]` and `n[1] <= n[2]`.**
