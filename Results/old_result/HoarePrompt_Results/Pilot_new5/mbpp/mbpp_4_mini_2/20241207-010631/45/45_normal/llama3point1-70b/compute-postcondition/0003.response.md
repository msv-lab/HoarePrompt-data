Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer that has at least 2 digits, `i` is 1, `undulating` is True. The current value of `n[i - 1]` is either less than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is less than `n[i + 1]`, or `n[i - 1]` is greater than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is greater than `n[i + 1]`.***
