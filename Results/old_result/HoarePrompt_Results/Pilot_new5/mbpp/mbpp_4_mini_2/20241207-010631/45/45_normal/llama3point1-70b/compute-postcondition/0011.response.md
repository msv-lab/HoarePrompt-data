The value of `undulating` is set to `False`. The initial state specifies that `undulating` was `True`, and now it has changed to `False`. The other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `undulating` is False, `i` is `len(n) - 1`**
