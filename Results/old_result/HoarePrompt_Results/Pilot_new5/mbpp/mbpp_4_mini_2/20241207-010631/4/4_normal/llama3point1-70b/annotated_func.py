#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one bit set to 1, indicating that num1 and num2 differ by exactly one power of two; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `num1` and `num2`, and returns True if the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` has exactly one bit set to 1, indicating that they differ by exactly one power of two. Otherwise, it returns False. There are no additional edge cases or missing functionality in the implementation.
