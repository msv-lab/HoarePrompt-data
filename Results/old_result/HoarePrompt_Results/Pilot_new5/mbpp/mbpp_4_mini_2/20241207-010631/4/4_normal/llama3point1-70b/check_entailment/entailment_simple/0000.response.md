Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` uses the bitwise XOR operator `^` to compare the two integers, `num1` and `num2`. Here's how it works:

1. The expression `num1 ^ num2` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the two numbers. The result will have bits set to 1 wherever the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.

2. The `bin()` function converts the result of the XOR operation into a binary string representation.

3. The method `.count('1')` counts the number of bits that are set to 1 in the binary string. 

4. The function checks if the count is equal to 1. If it is, this means that `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description. If not, it returns False.

This logic is sound because:

- If `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position, the XOR result will have exactly one bit set to 1.
- If they differ at zero or more than one bit positions, the count will not equal one, and the function will correctly return False.

Thus, the function correctly determines whether the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, as specified in the problem description.
