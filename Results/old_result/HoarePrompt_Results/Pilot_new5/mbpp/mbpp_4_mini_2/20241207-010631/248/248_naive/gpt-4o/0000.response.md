Correctness: **True**.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that converts a list to a tuple using Python's built-in `tuple()` function. The function is tested with three different assertions, each of which correctly checks that the conversion is performed as expected. 

Since the objective of the program is simply to convert a list to a tuple, and the function performs this task correctly for all specified test cases and should work for any list input (including empty lists), there are no potential cases where the function would fail according to the problem description. 

Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description.
