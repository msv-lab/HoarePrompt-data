Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list called `input_list` as input and returns a tuple containing all the elements from that list. 

Here's why it always meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to accept an input that is specifically a list. The annotations state that `input_list` can contain elements of any data type, which is correctly handled by the implementation.
  
2. **Conversion to Tuple**: The core functionality of the function utilizes the built-in `tuple()` constructor in Python, which effectively converts the list into a tuple. This aligns perfectly with what is requested in the problem descriptionâ€”converting a list to a tuple.

3. **Output**: The function returns the resulting tuple, which is exactly what is expected according to the problem description, ensuring that the output is a tuple representation of the input list.

4. **No Edge Cases**: The annotated comments state that there are no edge cases or missing functionalities, which is accurate in this context since converting an empty list, a list with mixed data types, or any valid list input will consistently yield the expected tuple output.

Therefore, the program adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description without any flaws or missing functionalities.
