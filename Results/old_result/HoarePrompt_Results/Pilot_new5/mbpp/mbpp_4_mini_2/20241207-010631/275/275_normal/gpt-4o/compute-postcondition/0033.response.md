Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers representing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.***
