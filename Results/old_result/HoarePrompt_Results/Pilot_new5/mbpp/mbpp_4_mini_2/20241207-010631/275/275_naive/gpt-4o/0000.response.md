To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the implementation in relation to the problem description.

**Problem Description:** Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

1. The function checks if the input list `nums` is empty and returns 0, which is correct since there would be no subsets in an empty list.
2. The list is sorted, which is a good strategy as it helps in checking divisibility.
3. The `dp` array is initialized to store the sizes of the largest divisible subsets ending at each index.
4. The nested loop structure is used to check each pair of numbers. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`.
5. Finally, the maximum value in the `dp` array is returned, which represents the size of the largest subset where each pair is divisible.

**Testing the Provided Assertions:**
- `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])` should return 4: Possible subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.
- `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])` should return 3: Possible subset is `[5, 10, 20]`.
- `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])` should return 4: Possible subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. If the input list contains numbers that are not divisible in pairs, such as `[2, 3, 5, 7]`, the expected output would be 1 as each number is only divisible by itself.
2. If the input list contains negative numbers, such as `[-2, -4, -8]`, it should still return 3 since the pairs will also be divisible based on the absolute value.

**Conclusion:**
Now, we need to check if there are any cases where the program might fail. 

After reviewing the logic, the only potential issue is if the program does not handle cases where all elements are unique primes or if numbers are negative, which might still be considered as divisible due to absolute values based on the described logic. 

However, since the implementation seems to correctly handle the given assertions and general cases according to the requirements, I could not identify any input that would cause it to fail nor does it violate the problem description.

Thus, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**.
