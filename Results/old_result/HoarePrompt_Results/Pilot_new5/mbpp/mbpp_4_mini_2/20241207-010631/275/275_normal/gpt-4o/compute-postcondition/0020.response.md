The code assigns a new value to `dp[i]` based on the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it indicates that `dp[j]` can contribute to `dp[i]` in terms of forming a chain. 

Letâ€™s denote the previous value of `dp[i]` as `dp[i]_prev` and the value of `dp[j]` as `dp[j]_prev`. The new value of `dp[i]` will be `max(dp[i]_prev, dp[j]_prev + 1)`.

Other variables (`nums`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged, while `dp[i]` gets updated based on the calculation. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i]` and retains the information about `nums`, `dp`, `i`, and `j`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `dp[i]` is now equal to `max(dp[i]_prev, dp[j] + 1)`**.
