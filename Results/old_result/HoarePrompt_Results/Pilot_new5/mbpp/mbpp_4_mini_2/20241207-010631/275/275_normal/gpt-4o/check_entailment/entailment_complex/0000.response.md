Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in that subset is divisible by one another. This aligns directly with the problem description.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: 
   - The function correctly returns `0` if the input list `nums` is empty. This is an important edge case since the problem description implies that a size of the subset is needed, and an empty list should logically result in a size of `0`.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of integers, which is crucial for the subsequent comparisons. By sorting, it ensures that when checking divisibility, smaller numbers are checked against larger numbers that follow them in the sorted list.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   - The function utilizes a dynamic programming approach to track the length of the longest divisible subsequence. The `dp` list correctly initializes with `1` for each element, indicating that each number can form a subsequence of at least itself.
   - The nested loops check all pairs of elements to see if one is divisible by the other (`nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`). If such a condition holds, it updates the `dp` value to reflect the maximum subsequence length found.

5. **Result Calculation**: 
   - Finally, the function returns `max(dp)` which represents the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible, fulfilling the requirement of the problem.

Given that the implementation effectively addresses all necessary conditions, including edge cases and efficiently computes the desired output, we conclude that the program is correct as per the problem description.
