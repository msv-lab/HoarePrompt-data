The line of code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]`. It assigns to `dp[i]` the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the current state of the variables, we can infer that `dp[i]` is at least 1 (as initialized), and since `dp[j]` is also at least 1, `dp[j] + 1` will always be greater than or equal to 2. 

Thus, `dp[i]` will be updated to either its current value or a value that is at least 2, depending on the value of `dp[j]`. 

The states of `nums`, `dp`, and `i` are not affected except for the possible update to `dp[i]`. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `dp` is a list of integers where each element is at least 1, and `dp[i]` is updated to max(`dp[i]`, `dp[j] + 1`)**.
