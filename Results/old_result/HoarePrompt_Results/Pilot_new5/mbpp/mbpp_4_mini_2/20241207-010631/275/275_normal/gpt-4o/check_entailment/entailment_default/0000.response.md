To assess the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate the code against the problem description and the output hints.

**Problem Description:** The task is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in that subset is divisible.

**Program Code:**
```python
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

**Output Hints:** The hints indicate that the function accepts a list of integers and returns 0 for an empty list. If the list is not empty, it returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequence from the sorted list of integers, using a dynamic programming approach.

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The code begins by checking if the input list is empty, returning `0` if it is, which aligns with the problem description.
2. It sorts the list, which is necessary for finding subsets where each pair is divisible.
3. The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to track the maximum size of the divisible subset for each number.
4. The nested loops check each pair of numbers in the sorted list, updating the `dp` array as appropriate.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- The program should correctly handle cases where all numbers are the same, where every number is divisible by each other. For example, given `[2, 2, 2]`, the result should be `3`.
- If all elements are prime numbers (e.g., `[2, 3, 5]`), none would be divisible by the others, so the largest subset would be `1`.

**Output Hints Verification:**
The output hints suggest that the program is designed to find the longest divisible subsequence, which matches the logic in the code. The examples provided in the hints seem to be valid and consistent with the expected output of the function.

**Conclusion:**
After a thorough examination of the code against the problem description and output hints, I cannot identify any edge cases that the code fails to handle. The code appears to correctly implement the logic necessary to find the largest subset of divisible numbers according to the outlined problem.

Correctness: **True**.
