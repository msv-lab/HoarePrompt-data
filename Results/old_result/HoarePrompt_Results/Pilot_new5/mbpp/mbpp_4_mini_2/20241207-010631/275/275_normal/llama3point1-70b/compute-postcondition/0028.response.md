Output State: **`dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by previous elements. The value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the divisibility condition with all previous elements of `nums` up to index `i-1`. If no elements before `i` are divisible by `nums[i]`, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
