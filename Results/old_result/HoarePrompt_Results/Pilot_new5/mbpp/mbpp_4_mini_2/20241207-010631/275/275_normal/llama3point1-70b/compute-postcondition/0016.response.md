Output State: **`dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by previous elements, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is the index corresponding to the last element processed in the loop. If the loop does not execute, `dp` remains a list of `1`s.**
