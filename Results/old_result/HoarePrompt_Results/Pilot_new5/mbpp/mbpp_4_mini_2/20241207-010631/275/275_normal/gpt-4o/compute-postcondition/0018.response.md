According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j`, which will take values from 0 to `i-1`. Given that `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, the loop will execute if `i` is at least 1. Since it is stated that `dp[i-1]` is at least 1 (if `i > 0`), we know there is at least one element in `dp`. Thus, the states that need to be ensured for the loop to execute are: `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` starts at 0. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
