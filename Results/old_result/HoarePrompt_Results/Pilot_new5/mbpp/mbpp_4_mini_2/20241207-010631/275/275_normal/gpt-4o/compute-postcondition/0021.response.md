Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value `dp[i]_prev` and `dp[j] + 1`.***
