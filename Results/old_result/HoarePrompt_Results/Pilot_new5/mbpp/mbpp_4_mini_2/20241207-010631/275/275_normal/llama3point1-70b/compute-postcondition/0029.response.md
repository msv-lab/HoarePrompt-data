According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the `nums` list starting from 1 up to but not including `len(nums)`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means `nums` has at least 2 elements for the loop to execute one more time. 

To execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < len(nums)` must be satisfied. This means that `nums` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where `nums[i]` is divisible by previous elements, `i` is 2, `nums` must have at least 3 elements**.
