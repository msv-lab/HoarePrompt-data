Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct as it successfully implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. 

Here's a breakdown of its correctness:

1. **Handling of an Empty List**: The program correctly returns 0 when the input list is empty, which aligns with the requirement.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the input list. This is a necessary step to ensure that when checking divisibility, we can build up the subset starting from smaller numbers to larger ones.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The use of a dynamic programming array `dp` correctly keeps track of the size of the largest divisible subset that can be formed for each number in the sorted list.

4. **Nested Loop for Divisibility Check**: The nested loops iterate through the sorted list, checking each pair of numbers, and if one number is divisible by another, it updates the `dp` array accordingly.

5. **Return the Maximum**: Finally, the program returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset.

The logic is sound, covers edge cases, and handles the requirements of the problem description comprehensively. Since I could not identify any input case that would lead to incorrect behavior, the program meets the requirements for all cases.

Thus, the program is correct.
