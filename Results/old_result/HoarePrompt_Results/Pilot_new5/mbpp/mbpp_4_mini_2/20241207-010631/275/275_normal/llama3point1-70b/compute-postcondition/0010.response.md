According to the loop structure, the execution of the loop is determined by the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `nums` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, and `j` has a value that is less than `i`. 

Given that `j` is currently at its most recent value, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `i` must remain greater than the updated value of `j`. This means that if `j` is currently at its maximum allowable value of `i - 1`, the loop cannot continue; hence `i` must remain greater than `j + 1` to allow the next iteration.

Since `j` will be incremented, its new value will be `j + 1`, and for the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be greater than this new value of `j`. Therefore, we can conclude the following:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `j` is incremented to `j + 1`, `i` must be greater than `j + 1`**
