To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic behind the function `func_1` and see if it meets the requirements described in the problem statement. 

The goal is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in that subset is divisible. The program includes a series of assertions that suggest it has been tested against certain cases.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Input Check:** The function starts by checking if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, which is correct behavior.

2. **Sorting:** The input list is sorted. This step is necessary because the subsequent logic relies on comparing pairs, and sorting helps ensure that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then it is guaranteed that `nums[i]` will be larger than or equal to `nums[j]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array:** The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`. Each element is initialized to 1, assuming that the smallest subset containing any number is the number itself.

4. **Nested Loop:** The outer loop iterates over each number in the sorted list, and the inner loop checks all previous numbers to determine if they can form a divisible pair with the current number. If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`.

5. **Result:** Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

### Potential Test Cases

We need to consider whether there are any cases that could break this logic:

1. **Single Element List:** `func_1([5])` should return 1, which is handled correctly.
2. **All Elements Not Divisible:** `func_1([2, 3, 5])` should return 1, since no two are divisible by each other. This case should also return correctly.
3. **Larger Numbers with Common Factors:** `func_1([10, 20, 30, 35])` should return 3 (the subset {10, 20, 30}). The program would handle this correctly, as it checks divisibility properly.
4. **Duplicates:** `func_1([5, 5, 5])` should also return 3, as all elements are equal and thus divisible by each other. It should handle this correctly as well.

### Conclusion

The provided implementation of `func_1` appears to cover all edge cases and the assertions provided indicate that it returns the expected results for the tested inputs.

Correctness: **True**

The function accurately computes the largest subset size where every pair is divisible, handles edge cases effectively, and returns expected values for provided assertions.
