Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is at least 1, `i` is at least 2, and `j` is set to 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
