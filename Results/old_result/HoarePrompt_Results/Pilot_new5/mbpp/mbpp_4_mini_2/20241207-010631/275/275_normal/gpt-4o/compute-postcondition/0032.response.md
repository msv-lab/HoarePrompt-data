The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `i` is equal to `length of nums + 1`, and `dp[i-1]` is at least 1, the calculation `dp[j] + 1` will yield a value that is greater than or equal to 2, depending on the specific value of `dp[j]`. The other values remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` is a list of integers where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each corresponding index in `nums`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` + 1, `j` will start at 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to be max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)**.
