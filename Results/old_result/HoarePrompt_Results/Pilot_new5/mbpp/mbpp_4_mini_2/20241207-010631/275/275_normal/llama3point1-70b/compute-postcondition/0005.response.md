According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `len(nums)`. The loop will start at `i = 1` and will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. For the loop to be executed, `len(nums)` must be at least 2, which means the `nums` list must contain at least 2 integers. At the start of the loop, `i` will be 1.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of integers with length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is `1`, `i` is 1**
