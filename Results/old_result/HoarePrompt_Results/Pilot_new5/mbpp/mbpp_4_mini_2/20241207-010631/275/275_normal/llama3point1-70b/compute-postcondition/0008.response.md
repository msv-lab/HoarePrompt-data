To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided, letâ€™s break down the variables and their values based on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `dp` is a list of integers with length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is `1`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `j` is `0`.
- The current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.

The code:
```
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

Analysis:
1. The variable `dp[i]` is being updated.
2. The current value of `dp[i]` is `1` (since all elements in `dp` start as `1`).
3. The current value of `dp[j]` is also `1`.
4. The expression `dp[j] + 1` results in `1 + 1 = 2`.
5. The `max` function compares `dp[i]` (which is `1`) and `dp[j] + 1` (which is `2`) and returns the larger value, which is `2`.
6. Therefore, `dp[i]` will be updated to `2`.

Other variables (`nums`, `dp`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged except for `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of integers with length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is `1` except `dp[1]` which is `2`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[1]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[0]`.**
