The value of `triangular_number` is assigned the result of the expression `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is initialized to 1, we can calculate the value of `triangular_number` as follows: `triangular_number = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 1 * 2 // 2 = 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 1, and `triangular_number` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1**.
