The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number. Based on the value of `n`, the function may return different values of `k` in the following cases: 

- Case_1: If the condition for the first case is met, the function returns `k`, which is equal to 1.
- Case_2: If the condition for the second case is met, the function returns `k`, which is equal to 2.
- Case_3: If the condition for the third case is met, the function returns the value of `k`, which is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, and based on specific conditions related to the triangular number, it returns different values of `k` (1, 2, or 3). 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, and returns k, which can be 1, 2, or 3 based on specific conditions.**
