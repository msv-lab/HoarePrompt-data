Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `idx` is initialized to 1, which is the starting index for calculating triangular numbers.

2. **Looping through triangular numbers**: The program enters an infinite loop (`while True`), where it calculates the triangular number for the current index `idx` using the formula `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. This formula is correct for calculating the `idx`-th triangular number.

3. **Checking the number of digits**: The program checks if the number of digits in the triangular number (`len(str(triangular_num))`) is equal to or greater than `n`. If this condition is met, the function returns the current index `idx`, which corresponds to the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits.

4. **Incrementing the index**: If the condition is not met, `idx` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues until a triangular number with at least `n` digits is found.

5. **Termination and correctness**: Since the loop continues until it finds the desired triangular number, and `idx` precisely represents the index of the found triangular number, the program will always return the correct index as specified in the problem description.

Thus, the implementation is consistent with the requirement to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, making the program correct.
