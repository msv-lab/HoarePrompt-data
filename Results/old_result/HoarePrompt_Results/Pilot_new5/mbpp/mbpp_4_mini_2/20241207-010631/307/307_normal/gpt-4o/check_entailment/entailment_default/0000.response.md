To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, we'll analyze the problem description and the code, looking for any edge cases or discrepancies.

**Problem Description:** The task is to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits.

**Program Code:**
```python
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Functionality**: The function uses a while loop to calculate triangular numbers (defined by the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`) and checks if the length of the number (converted to a string) is equal to `n`. If it finds such a triangular number, it returns `k`.
2. **Behavior**: This logic seems to be correct for finding the smallest `k` such that the triangular number has exactly `n` digits. 

### Edge Cases:
- The input `n` must be a positive integer. The function currently does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or non-integer values, which leads to undefined behavior.
- If `n` is 1, it will return `k = 1`, which corresponds to the first triangular number (1) that has 1 digit. However, since the function does not check for invalid input, if `n` were passed as a negative number or zero, it could lead to an infinite loop.

### Output Hints:
- The output hints mention that the function accepts a positive integer `n`, which suggests that `n` should be greater than 0.
- They also confirm that the function continues to calculate triangular numbers until it finds one that meets the digit length condition. The hints correctly indicate the output behavior based on the function's calculations.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
- The output hints seem to agree with the code's intended behavior, as the assertions provided are consistent with the triangular numbers calculated by the function.
- However, the hints also note that there are no checks for invalid input, which is a critical flaw.

### Conclusion:
The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, primarily due to the lack of input validation for `n`. The function could lead to undefined behavior if provided with invalid inputs (like negative numbers or non-integers). This means that there could be cases where the function does not behave correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
