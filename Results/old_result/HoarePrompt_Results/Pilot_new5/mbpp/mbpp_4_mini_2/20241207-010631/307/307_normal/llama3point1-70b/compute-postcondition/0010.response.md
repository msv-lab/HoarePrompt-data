Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `triangular_num` is 3, and `idx` is 2. If the number of digits in `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `idx` (which is 2). Otherwise, the function does not return any value (None).***
