The program provided is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. A triangular number for a given index `idx` is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. The program continues incrementing `idx` until it finds a triangular number that has at least `n` digits.

Upon examining the code and the problem description, it appears that the program will correctly return the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits for positive integers `n`. 

However, there is a significant edge case that the code does not handle: if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the program will enter an infinite loop because the condition in the while loop will never be fulfilled (there won't be a triangular number with less than 1 digit). The output hints clearly state that the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, which confirms the presence of this edge case.

The output hints further reiterate this limitation, stating that it may lead to an infinite loop if such values are passed. Therefore, since the program does not correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases, specifically when `n <= 0`, the correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0, leading to an infinite loop.
