The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is designed to take a tuple called `numbers`, which is confirmed to have a length of N+1. This aligns with the problem description that specifies the input as a tuple of numbers of length N+1.

2. **Output Requirements**: The program correctly returns a tuple of length N by multiplying each element of the input tuple with its subsequent element. Specifically, it uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to create pairs (t_i, t_{i+1}) and then computes their products. This corresponds directly to the requirement that the i-th element of the output tuple should be equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function is designed to return a tuple of length N (which is N+1 - 1) as required. If the input has fewer than two elements, the function will return an empty tuple. This behavior is consistent with the problem's requirement that the function should not attempt to compute products if there are insufficient elements.

4. **Correctness Across Types**: The annotation confirms that the function can handle any numerical type, which is a necessary aspect of the problem since it does not restrict the types of numbers that can be included in the tuple.

Given all of these points, the function `func_1` adheres to the problem description's requirements in all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
