To verify the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the problem description and the given code.

**Problem description:** Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))

```

**Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `numbers` as input.
2. It uses the `zip` function to create pairs of consecutive elements from the tuple: `(t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3), ..., (t_N, t_{N+1})`.
3. For each pair `(a, b)`, it computes the product `a * b`.
4. The result is converted into a tuple.

**Correctness Check:**
- The function returns a tuple of size `N` where each element is the product of consecutive elements in the input tuple.
- It handles the edge case of an empty tuple correctly by returning an empty tuple, as `zip` would produce no pairs. 
- For a tuple with a single element, the output would also be an empty tuple, which aligns with the requirement since there are no pairs to multiply.
- For tuples with more than one element, it correctly computes the products.

**Example Cases:**
- For input `(1, 2, 3)`, the output should be `(1*2, 2*3) = (2, 6)`.
- For input `(4, 5, 6, 7)`, the output should be `(4*5, 5*6, 6*7) = (20, 30, 42)`.
- For input `(1,)`, the output should be `()` (empty tuple).
- For input `()`, the output should also be `()` (empty tuple).

Since the program behaves correctly for all potential cases and matches what the problem describes, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True**.
