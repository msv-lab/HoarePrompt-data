`str_n` is assigned the string representation of `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. The state of the variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`**.
