Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately follows the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

2. **Digit Counting**: The program converts the integer to a string (`str_n = str(n)`) to iterate through each digit. For each digit in `str_n`, it counts how many times that digit appears in the string with `str_n.count(digit)`.

3. **Frequency Check**: The key condition in the loop checks whether the frequency of each digit (obtained using `str_n.count(digit)`) is greater than the digit itself (converted to an integer with `int(digit)`). If this condition is met for any digit, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the frequency of that digit exceeds its value.

4. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without returning `False`, it reaches the final return statement which returns `True`. This indicates that all digits in the number have frequencies that are less than or equal to their respective values, which is exactly what the problem specifies.

5. **Edge Case for `0`**: The program correctly handles the case when `n` is `0`. The count of the digit '0' will be `1`, which is not greater than `0`, so it correctly returns `True`.

In summary, the program correctly implements the logic required to check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself, fulfilling all aspects of the problem description.
