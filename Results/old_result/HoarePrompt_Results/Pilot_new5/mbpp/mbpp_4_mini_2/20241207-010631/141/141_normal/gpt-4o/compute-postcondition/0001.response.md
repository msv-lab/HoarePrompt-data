The code initializes the variable `frequency` as an empty dictionary. This does not directly impact the values of `n` or `digit_str`, which remain unchanged. The variable `frequency` is now set to be an empty dictionary. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is an empty dictionary.**
