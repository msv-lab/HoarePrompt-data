`digit_str` is assigned the string representation of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` will be a string that consists of the digits of `n` in the same order. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`**
