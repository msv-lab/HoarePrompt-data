To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the description and the implementation.

### Problem Description:
The function must check if the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Program Review:
The function `func_1` does the following:
1. Converts the integer `n` to a string to iterate over each digit.
2. Constructs a frequency dictionary that counts occurrences of each digit.
3. Iterates over the frequency dictionary and checks if the count of each digit is greater than the digit itself.
4. Returns `False` if any digit's frequency exceeds the digit, otherwise returns `True`.

### Test Cases:
The program includes assertions for three test cases:
- `func_1(1234) == True`: Each digit (1, 2, 3, and 4) appears once, which is less than or equal to itself.
- `func_1(51241) == False`: The digit `1` appears twice, which is greater than its value of `1`.
- `func_1(321) == True`: Each digit (3, 2, and 1) appears once, which is less than or equal to itself.

### Edge Cases:
Now, letâ€™s consider edge cases:
1. **Single digit numbers**: For example, `func_1(0)` should return `True` since the frequency of `0` is 1 which is not less than or equal to `0`, which contradicts the expectation.
2. **Repeated digits**: For example, `func_1(1111)`. Here, `1` appears 4 times, which is greater than `1`.
3. **Negative numbers**: The problem doesn't specify behavior for negative integers, and the function does not handle this case.

### Conclusion:
Since we found that the program does not handle the edge case of single digits correctly, especially for `0`, and the repeated digit case (`1111`), we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False** 

The function fails for inputs like `0` and `1111`, where it does not correctly determine the validity based on the described conditions.
