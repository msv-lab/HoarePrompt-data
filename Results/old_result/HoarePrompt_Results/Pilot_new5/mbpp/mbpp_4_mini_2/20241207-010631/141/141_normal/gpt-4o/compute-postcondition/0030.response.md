Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, calculates the frequency of each digit in its string representation, and returns True if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit; otherwise, it returns False. It does not account for negative integers or non-integer types, as the input is assumed to be a non-negative integer. **
