To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop.

1. **State Before the Loop Starts**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`.
   - `frequency` is a dictionary that contains the count of each digit present in `digit_str`.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `frequency.items()`, which means `frequency` must contain at least one entry for the loop to execute.

3. **Conditions for Execution**:
   - If `n` is 0:
     - `digit_str` will be `"0"`, and `frequency` will be `{'0': 1}`. The loop will execute because `frequency` contains one item.
   - If `n` is greater than 0:
     - `digit_str` will reflect the digits of `n`, and `frequency` should contain the counts of those digits. For the loop to execute, `frequency` must be a non-empty dictionary.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute:
     - `frequency` must be a non-empty dictionary.
     - If `n` is 0, then `frequency` is correctly set to `{'0': 1}`.
     - If `n` is greater than 0, `frequency` must contain counts of the digits of `n`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute properly, we need to adjust the conditions to reflect that `frequency` must not be empty. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` must not be empty**.
