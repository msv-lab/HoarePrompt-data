According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of the integer `n`. The variable `digit` takes on the value of each character in `str_n` sequentially. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the first character of `str_n`. For the loop to execute one more time, it must continue to the next character in the string. 

Since `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, the total number of characters (digits) in `str_n` is determined by the value of `n`. The loop will execute for each character in `str_n`, so we need to ensure that the next character exists.

If `digit` is the first character, then for the loop to execute again, `digit` should be the second character in `str_n`. Therefore, the index of `digit` in the next iteration must be 1, and since `str_n` has at least 2 characters, we need to state that `str_n` must contain at least 2 characters.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n` that must contain at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character of `str_n`.**
