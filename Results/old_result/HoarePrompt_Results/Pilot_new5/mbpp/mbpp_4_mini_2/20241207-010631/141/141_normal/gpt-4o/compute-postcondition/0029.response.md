The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function has multiple return cases: 

- Case 1: It returns `False`, indicating that the condition for returning `True` is not met, given that the current value of `count` is greater than the integer value of `digit`.
- Case 2: It returns `False`.
- Case 3: It returns `False`.
- Case 4: It returns `True`, indicating that the frequency of each digit in the string representation of the non-negative integer `n` is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and evaluate the frequency of its digits, returning `True` or `False` based on specific conditions related to the digits' frequencies. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a non-negative integer, and returns True if the frequency of each digit in the string representation of n is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit; otherwise, it returns False.**
