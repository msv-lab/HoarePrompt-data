#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. If any sublist is empty, it will raise an `IndexError` due to attempting to access the first element, as there are no elements in that sublist.
