Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the problem description as it does not handle the case where any sublist may be empty. According to the problem description, the function should return the first element of each sublist. However, if a sublist is empty, the program will raise an `IndexError` when it attempts to access the first element of that empty sublist. This behavior contradicts the requirement implied in the problem description that the function should reliably return a list of the first elements of each sublist without causing any errors. 

For instance, the input `func_1([[], [1, 2]])` would raise an error rather than returning a result, showing that the function does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
