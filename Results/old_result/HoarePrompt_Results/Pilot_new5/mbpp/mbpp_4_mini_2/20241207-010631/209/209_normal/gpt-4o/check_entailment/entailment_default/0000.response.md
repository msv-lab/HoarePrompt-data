The code provided is meant to retrieve the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists. The implementation uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist and returns the first element. 

However, the problem description does not account for the case where any of the sublists might be empty. If any of the sublists are empty, the code will attempt to access the first element of that empty sublist, leading to an `IndexError`. Therefore, the function does not handle this edge case correctly.

The output hints confirm this issue, stating that if any sublist is empty, it will raise an `IndexError`. This means that the function does not fulfill the requirement of safely retrieving the first element of each sublist, as it fails for the edge case of empty sublists.

Thus, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when handling empty sublists.

Correctness: **False**.
