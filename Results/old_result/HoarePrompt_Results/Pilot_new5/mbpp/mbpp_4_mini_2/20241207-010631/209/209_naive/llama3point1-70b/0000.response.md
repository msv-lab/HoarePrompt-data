Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. For example, if the input is `[[], [1, 2, 3], [4]]`, the program will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access `sublist[0]` for the empty sublist. Thus, the program does not correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases.
