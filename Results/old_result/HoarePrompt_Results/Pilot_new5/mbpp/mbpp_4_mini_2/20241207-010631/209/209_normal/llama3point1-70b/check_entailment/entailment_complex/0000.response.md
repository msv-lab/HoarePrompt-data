Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases. Specifically, while the function `func_1` is designed to return the first element of each sublist, it fails to handle the case where any of the sublists are empty. According to the annotations, if a sublist is empty, the program will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access the first element with `sublist[0]`. This behavior contradicts the requirement to retrieve the first element of each sublist, as an empty sublist does not have a first element. 

For example, if the input `sublists` is `[[], [1, 2], [3, 4]]`, the program will raise an error instead of returning a valid output. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
