The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, returning the index at which the value can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If the value is less than or equal to any of the integers in the list, it returns the index of the first such integer. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which indicates that the value should be appended at the end of the list.
