To assess the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list, ensuring that the order remains sorted after insertion.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)
```

### Output Hints:
The function should return:
- The index at which the value can be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
- If the value is less than or equal to any of the integers in the list, it returns the index of the first such integer.
- If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Code Logic**:
   - The loop iterates through `sorted_list` and checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the `value`.
   - If such an element is found, it returns the index `i`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any element greater than or equal to the `value`, it returns the length of the list, indicating that the `value` should be inserted at the end.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `sorted_list` is empty, the function should return `0` since the value can be inserted at the start.
   - If `value` is less than the first element of `sorted_list`, it should return `0`.
   - If `value` is equal to an element in `sorted_list`, it should return the index of the first occurrence of that element.
   - If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, it should return `len(sorted_list)`.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints align with the code's intended behavior:
- The hints describe the returning of the index for insertion and confirm that `len(sorted_list)` will be returned when the value is greater than all elements.
- The criteria for returning the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to `value` is accurately represented, and thus agrees with the code.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly handles all described cases and aligns with the output hints. It appears to cover general edge cases effectively, including empty lists and insertion at the start or end of the list.

Correctness: **True**. 

This is because the code accurately implements the required functionality described in both the problem statement and the output hints for all potential cases.
