According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sorted_list`. The loop will execute `len(sorted_list)` times, which means the list must have at least 0 elements. If `sorted_list` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. 

Since `i` starts at 0 and will increment by 1 on each iteration, we can adjust the state to reflect this. The current state indicates that the loop is ready to execute, and we can begin with `i` at the starting index of the loop.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order, `value` is an integer that needs to be inserted, `i` is 0**
