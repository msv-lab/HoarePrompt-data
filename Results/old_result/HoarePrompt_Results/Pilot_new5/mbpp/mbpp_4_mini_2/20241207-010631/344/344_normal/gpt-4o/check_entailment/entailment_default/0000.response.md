The provided program uses the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to find the index at which a specified value can be inserted into a sorted list without disrupting its order. The function is expected to handle various scenarios, including inserting values that are smaller than, equal to, or larger than existing elements in the list.

Upon examining the code and its description:

1. The function `func_1(sorted_list, value)` indeed aims to find the right insertion point in a sorted list for the given value.
2. The assertions provided suggest that:
   - Inserting `6` into `[1, 2, 4, 5]` should return `4`, as it would be appended after `5`.
   - Inserting `3` should return `2`, as it would fit between `2` and `4`.
   - Inserting `7` should also return `4`, indicating that it can also be placed at the end since there are no elements greater than `6`.

Now let's analyze the output hints:
- The hints confirm that the function takes a sorted list and an integer value and returns the correct index for insertion to maintain the list's order.

Considering edge cases:
- The function should also handle cases where the list is empty.
- It should correctly handle cases where the insertion value matches an existing element in the list.
- It should maintain the behavior for negative numbers and zero, as well as large integers.

However, the output hints do not explicitly mention edge cases like an empty list or how it will behave when the input list contains duplicate elements.

The function appears to correctly implement the required logic for the provided examples, and if we test it with additional edge cases such as:
- An empty list (`func_1([], 5)` should return `0`)
- A list with duplicate elements (`func_1([1, 1, 1], 1)` should return `3`, since it should insert after the last `1`)

The function would handle these cases properly as well. 

Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case and the output hints align with this understanding, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly identifies the index at which a value can be inserted without violating the sorted order of the list across various scenarios, including edge cases.
