#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers in sorted order, and value is an integer to be inserted.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index where the integer 'value' can be inserted in 'sorted_list' while maintaining the sorted order, using the bisect_right method from the bisect module.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers and an integer value, and returns the index at which the value can be inserted into the list without disrupting its sorted order, using the bisect_right method from the bisect module. This index returned can be used for various situations, such as inserting the value to maintain order in the sorted list.
