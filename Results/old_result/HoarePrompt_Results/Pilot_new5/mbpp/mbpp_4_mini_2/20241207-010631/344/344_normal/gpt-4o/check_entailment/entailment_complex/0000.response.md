Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the explanation:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the appropriate index for inserting a specified value into a sorted list of integers. This aligns directly with the problem description, which states the function must locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

2. **Use of `bisect.bisect_right`**: The function utilizes the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module, which effectively finds the position in the sorted list where the specified value can be inserted. This method returns an index that maintains the sorted order, which is exactly what the problem requires.

3. **Assertions for Testing**: The assertions provided in the code serve as test cases to validate the correctness of the function. The expected results demonstrate that the function can accurately determine the insertion point for different values in the sorted list.

4. **Explanation of Function Behavior**: The annotations in the code clearly describe that the function returns the index at which the value can be inserted without disrupting the sorted order. This is essential for confirming that the function adheres to the problem's requirements.

Since the function correctly identifies the insertion index for any value in a sorted list, as described in the problem, we can conclude that the implementation is correct.
