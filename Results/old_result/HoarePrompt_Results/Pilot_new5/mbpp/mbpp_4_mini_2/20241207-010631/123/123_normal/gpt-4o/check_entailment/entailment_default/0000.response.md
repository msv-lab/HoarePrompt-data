The provided program is designed to split a list into two parts based on a given integer `L`. The first part will contain the first `L` elements of the list, while the second part will contain the rest of the elements.

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

### Assessment:
1. If `L` is less than 0, this code will not handle it correctly because slicing with a negative `L` returns an empty list for the first part and the whole list for the second part, which is not described in the problem. The problem does not mention that `L` can be negative, but it does mention that `L` is supposed to be an integer and does not specify its bounds clearly.
2. If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first part will correctly contain all elements and the second part will be empty.
3. If `L` is 0, the first part will be empty and the second part will contain all elements of `lst`, which is correct.

Next, I will examine the output hints:
- The output hints state that the function returns the first `L` elements and the remainder of the list starting from index `L`. It also mentions edge cases for `L` being equal to the length of the list and `L` being 0, which are correctly handled by the code.

### Conclusion:
The output hints agree with the code for valid cases, but they do not address the situation when `L` is negative. Since the problem description does not clarify that `L` should always be non-negative, this lack of handling negative `L` means that the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
