Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets all the requirements:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(lst, L)` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, which matches the problem description.

2. **Slicing Logic**: The program uses Python's list slicing feature:
   - `lst[:L]` extracts the first `L` elements from the list.
   - `lst[L:]` extracts the elements starting from index `L` to the end of the list.
   This correctly splits the list into two parts as the problem requires.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `L` is equal to the length of the list, `lst[:L]` will include all elements, and `lst[L:]` will be an empty list. This adheres to the specification that if `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first part contains all elements, and the second part is empty.
   - If `L` is 0, `lst[:L]` will be an empty list, and `lst[L:]` will contain all elements of `lst`, fulfilling the requirement that if `L` is 0, the first list is empty, and the second list contains all elements.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided after the function definition demonstrate that the function works correctly with various types of input, including different data types (integers and strings) and edge cases (like an empty list or L values at the boundaries).

Since the implementation satisfies all the conditions laid out in the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately, I conclude that the program is correct.
