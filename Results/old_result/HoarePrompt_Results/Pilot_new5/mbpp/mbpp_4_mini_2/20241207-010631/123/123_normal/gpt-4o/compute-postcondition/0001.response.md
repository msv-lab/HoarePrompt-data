The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. The parameter `lst` is a list of any type, and `L` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len}(lst)\). The function returns a tuple consisting of two lists: the first list is a slice of `lst` from the beginning up to index `L`, and the second list is the remainder of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and return a tuple containing a slice of the list and the remainder of the list based on the provided index `L`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple of two lists: the first list is a slice of `lst` from the start up to index `L`, and the second list is the remainder of `lst` from index `L` to the end.**
