The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. The parameter `lst` is a list that can contain any elements, and `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple consisting of two lists: the first list is a slice of `lst` from the beginning up to index `L`, and the second list is a slice of `lst` from index `L` to the end. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and return a tuple containing two slices of the list based on the index `L`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple containing two lists: the first list is a slice of `lst` from the beginning up to index `L`, and the second list is a slice of `lst` from index `L` to the end.**
