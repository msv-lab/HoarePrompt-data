Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the integer `L` is greater than the length of the list `lst`. For example:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 5) == ([1, 2, 3], [])
```

In this case, the expected output would be `([1, 2, 3], [])` since the first part should contain all elements of the list, and the second part should be empty. However, if `L` is greater than the length of the list, the function will return the entire list as the first part without an empty second part, which does not satisfy the requirement stated in the problem description.

Thus, the program incorrectly handles this case, making it incorrect overall.
