Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, it lacks handling for edge cases such as:

1. **Empty Lists**: The code does not explicitly handle the case when the input list `arr` is empty. In such a case, it should ideally return an empty list. However, the current implementation does not check for this condition, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

2. **Single-Element Lists**: Although the function's behavior on a single-element list would return the input as it is already sorted, this case is not explicitly accounted for within the code logic. The function `find_max_index` returns `0` if `n` is 1, which is acceptable, but the overall sorting function does not explicitly state how it behaves with a single-element input.

3. **Assumptions on `arr`**: The functions rely on the global variable `arr`, which is not defined within the scope of `find_max_index` and `flip`. This can lead to errors if multiple instances of the function are called with different lists in a single program execution.

Given these issues, particularly the lack of specific handling for empty and single-element lists, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description comprehensively. Hence, it is deemed incorrect.
