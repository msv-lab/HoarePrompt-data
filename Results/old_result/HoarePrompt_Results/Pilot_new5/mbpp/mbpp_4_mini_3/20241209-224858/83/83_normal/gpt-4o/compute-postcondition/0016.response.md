Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements of any type, `n` is at least 2, `curr_size` is `n - 2`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` among the first `n - 2` elements. If `max_index` is not equal to `curr_size - 1`, then `flip(max_index)` and `flip(n - 3)` have been executed.***
