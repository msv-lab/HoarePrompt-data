According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `size` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if `size` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, it will be `k - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Since the loop starts at `n` and goes down to 1 (inclusive), the next value of `size` after the current iteration must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute again. Additionally, the list `arr` is mentioned to have its first `n - 1` elements reversed only if `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`. However, for the purpose of continuing the loop, we only need to adjust `size`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, with the first `n - 1` elements reversed if `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, `size` is decremented to `size - 1`**
