The code snippet `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the elements in the `arr` list from index `0` to `size - 1` (which corresponds to the first `n - 1` elements). 

- `arr[:size]` represents the sublist of `arr` from index `0` to `size - 1`.
- The operation `[::-1]` creates a reversed version of that sublist.
- This operation will only affect the elements from index `0` to `size - 1` in `arr`.

After executing this code, the elements from index `0` to `size - 1` are reversed. 

The `size` is equal to `n - 1`, which means the first `n - 1` elements of `arr` are reversed, and `max_index` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with the first `n - 1` elements reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` from the first `n - 1` elements.**
