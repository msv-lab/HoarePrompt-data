The function `find_max_index` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the length of the list `arr`, which is a list of comparable elements. The function returns the index of the maximum value in the list `arr` from the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, with the condition that `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `find_max_index` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of comparable elements `arr`, and return the index of the maximum value within the specified range of the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list arr, and returns the index of the maximum value in the list arr from arr[0] to arr[n-1].**
