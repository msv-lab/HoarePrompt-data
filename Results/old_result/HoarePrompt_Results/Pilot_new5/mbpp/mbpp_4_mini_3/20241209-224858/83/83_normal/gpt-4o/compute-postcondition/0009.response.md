The value of `max_index` is assigned to `i`, which is equal to 3. The previous value of `max_index` was 2, but now it will be updated to 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 3, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 3, `i` is 3.**
