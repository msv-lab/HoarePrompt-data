To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description of sorting a list of elements, I will analyze the algorithm and consider various potential edge cases.

The algorithm used in the function `func_1` appears to implement a form of selection sort by repeatedly finding the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list and reversing portions of the list to move that maximum to its correct position. However, there are several potential issues to consider:

1. **Empty List**: If `arr` is an empty list, the function will return an empty list, which is correct as an empty list is trivially sorted.

2. **Single Element List**: If `arr` contains a single element, it should return that element as a sorted list. This case is also handled correctly.

3. **All Elements Identical**: If all elements in the list are identical, the list should remain unchanged. The function appears to handle this correctly as well.

4. **Lists with Mixed Data Types**: If the list contains mixed data types (e.g., strings and integers), the `max` function will raise a `TypeError` since Python cannot compare different data types directly. This is a significant flaw in the code as it does not handle such cases.

5. **Negative and Positive Integers**: The function should correctly sort lists with negative and positive integers, and it appears to function correctly in this case.

6. **Already Sorted List**: If the list is already sorted, the function will unnecessarily perform operations but will still return the sorted list, which is correct.

Given the analysis, the program fails in the case where the list contains mixed data types, which is a legitimate scenario for a sorting function.

Correctness: **False**
