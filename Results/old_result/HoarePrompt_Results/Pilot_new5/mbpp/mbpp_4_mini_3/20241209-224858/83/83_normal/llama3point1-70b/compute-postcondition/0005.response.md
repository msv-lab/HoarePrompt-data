The code snippet provided reverses a portion of the list `arr`. Specifically, it reverses the sublist from the start of the list to the index `max_index` (inclusive). The values of `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remain unchanged through this operation, and their relationships to the list are still valid.

The resulting state after executing the code is that the elements of `arr` from the start up to `max_index` (inclusive) are reversed, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` has its elements from index 0 to `max_index` reversed; `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`, and `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` and not equal to 0.**
