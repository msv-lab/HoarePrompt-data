The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the list `arr`, which indicates the number of elements in `arr`. The value of `arr` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other; `n` is the length of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other; `n` is the length of `arr`.**
