Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly sort a list of elements as required by the problem description. Specifically, there are several issues:

1. **Variable Scope**: The `flip` and `find_max_index` functions use a variable `arr` without it being passed as an argument. As a result, these functions will raise a `NameError` if `arr` is not defined in the global scope, which is not guaranteed in every use case of `func_1`.

2. **Logic of the Sort**: The sorting logic implemented in `func_1` appears to be a variation on the pancake sorting algorithm, but it is not guaranteed to sort the array correctly in every case. For instance, if the list contains duplicate elements or is already sorted, the flipping logic could fail to maintain correct order.

3. **Assumptions on Input**: The program assumes that the list to be sorted contains comparable elements and does not handle cases where the input might be invalid, such as empty lists or lists with non-comparable data types.

4. **Flipping Logic**: The flipping mechanism itself may not effectively sort the list. The current implementation does not ensure that after each flip, the elements are in the right order, which could lead to incorrect results.

Due to these reasons, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. It is not guaranteed to sort all lists of elements correctly, which is the main requirement of the task. Thus, it fails to meet the problem description.
