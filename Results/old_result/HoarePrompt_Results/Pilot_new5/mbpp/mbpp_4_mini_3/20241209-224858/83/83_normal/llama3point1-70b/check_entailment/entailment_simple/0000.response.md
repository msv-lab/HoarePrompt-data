Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a sorting algorithm. Here's the explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` as its parameter, which aligns with the problem description of needing to sort a list of elements.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The program employs a sorting technique that repeatedly finds the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to its correct position at the end. This is effectively a selection sort method but implemented with a reversal technique.

3. **Reversal Mechanism**: The use of slicing and reversing (`[::-1]`) is a valid way to sort the list. The first reversal brings the maximum element to the front, and the second reversal places it at the end of the sorted portion. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

4. **Output**: The function returns the sorted list, which meets the requirement to sort the list of elements.

5. **Correctness for All Cases**: The algorithm handles all comparable elements correctly, regardless of their initial order, which fulfills the requirement of sorting the list in ascending order.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description, ensuring that it sorts a list of elements as specified. Therefore, the correctness is affirmed.
