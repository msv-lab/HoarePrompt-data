Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the sorting function as required. Specifically, the `find_max_index` function attempts to access the `arr` variable, which is not defined within its scope. The function relies on a global variable `arr`, which is not a good practice and leads to an error when `find_max_index` is called.

Additionally, there are issues with how the `flip` function is used within `func_1`, as it assumes that the `arr` variable is globally accessible, which it is not in its current form. This will lead to a `NameError` when the program is executed.

For example, if we call `func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69])`, it will result in an error due to the absence of `arr` in the `find_max_index` function, and thus it will not return the expected sorted list.

Hence, the program is incorrect.
