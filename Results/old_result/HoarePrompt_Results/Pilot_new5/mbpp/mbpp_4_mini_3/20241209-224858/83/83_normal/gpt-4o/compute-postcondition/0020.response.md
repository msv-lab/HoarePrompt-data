Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `arr` of elements of any type and returns the sorted list of elements in ascending order. It uses the flip operation based on the positions of the maximum elements to achieve the sorted order. However, it assumes that the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined elsewhere, and their functionality is not verified here. Edge cases such as empty lists or single-element lists are not handled explicitly, but the function's behavior on such cases is to simply return the input since no sorting is needed. **
