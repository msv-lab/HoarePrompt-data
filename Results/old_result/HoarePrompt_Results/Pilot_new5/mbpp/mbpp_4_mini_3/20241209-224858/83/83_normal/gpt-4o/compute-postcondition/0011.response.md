After analyzing the loop code and the provided information, here is the output state:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` from the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is 1), then `max_index` remains 0.**
