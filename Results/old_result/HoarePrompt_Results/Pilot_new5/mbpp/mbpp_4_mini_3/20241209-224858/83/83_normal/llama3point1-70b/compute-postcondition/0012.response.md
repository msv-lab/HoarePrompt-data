Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n - 1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` from the first `n - 1` elements. If `max_index` is not 0, then the elements in `arr` from index `0` to `max_index` are reversed.***
