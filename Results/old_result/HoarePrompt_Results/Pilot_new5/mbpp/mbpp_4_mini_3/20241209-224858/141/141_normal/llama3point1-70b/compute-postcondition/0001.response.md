According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `str_n`. For the loop to execute, `str_n` must be a non-empty string since the loop iterates over each character in `str_n`. The variable `n` being a non-negative integer does not guarantee that `str_n` will be non-empty; it could be "0" (which is valid) or an empty string if `n` is 0 and not converted properly. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` would represent the last character in `str_n`.

For the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 0 and `str_n` must be a non-empty string representation of `n`. Initially, `digit` will be the first character of `str_n`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` must be a non-empty string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character of `str_n`**
