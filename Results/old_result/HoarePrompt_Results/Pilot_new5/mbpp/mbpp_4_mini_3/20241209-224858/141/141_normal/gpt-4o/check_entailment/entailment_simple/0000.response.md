Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the problem states that the function should check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the digit is '0'.

In the context of the problem, if a digit '0' appears in the integer, its frequency must be zero (i.e., '0' cannot appear in the integer at all), because the digit '0' cannot have a frequency greater than itself. The program currently counts the frequency of '0' if it exists within the integer, and since it does not check for this special condition, it may return incorrect results.

For example:
- If the input is `100`, the program would count the digit '0' as occurring once, which is greater than the digit itself (0), and thus it should return `False`. However, the logic does not explicitly handle the case of '0' and may not return the expected result for integers containing '0'.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description due to this oversight.
