#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `digit` has iterated through each character of `str_n`, and the count of each `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. If any `digit` had a count greater than its integer value, the function would have returned False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the count of each digit in 'str_n' is less than or equal to its integer value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks whether the count of each digit in its string representation is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. If any digit's count exceeds its integer value, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. The function does not handle invalid inputs, such as negative integers, as it is designed only for non-negative integers.
