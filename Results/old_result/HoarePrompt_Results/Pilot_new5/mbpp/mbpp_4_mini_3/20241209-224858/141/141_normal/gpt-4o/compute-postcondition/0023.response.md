Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair remaining, and `count` is less than or equal to the integer value of the next `digit`. If `count` is greater than `int(digit)`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no specific return value from the function.***
