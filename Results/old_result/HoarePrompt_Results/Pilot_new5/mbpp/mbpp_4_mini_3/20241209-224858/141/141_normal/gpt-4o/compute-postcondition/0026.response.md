Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` has at least one key-value pair remaining, and `count` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. If `count` is greater than `int(digit)`, the function returns False; otherwise, there are no changes made to the state of the program.***
