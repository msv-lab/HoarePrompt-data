Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` using the built-in string method `count()`. This method counts all non-overlapping occurrences of the substring, which aligns with the problem description. It will handle all cases, including when 'std' appears multiple times, not at all, or in different positions within the string. Thus, I cannot find any case where the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
