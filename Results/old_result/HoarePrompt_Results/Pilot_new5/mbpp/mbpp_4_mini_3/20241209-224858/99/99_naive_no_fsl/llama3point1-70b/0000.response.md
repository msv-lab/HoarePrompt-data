Correctness: **False**

The problem description states to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string. However, the provided program actually retains characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) and discards those at odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.). 

For example, if the input string is "abcdef", the output of the program would be "ace", which retains the characters at indices 0, 2, and 4. However, according to the problem description, we should be returning "bdf", which consists of the characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5).

Thus, the program does not implement the specified requirement correctly.
