Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the task of removing characters from a given string that are located at odd index values. It achieves this by iterating through the string with a step of 2, which effectively selects characters at even indexes (0, 2, 4, etc.). 

For every potential case:
- If the input string is empty, it would return an empty string, which is correct.
- For a string like "abcdef", it would return "ace", correctly omitting characters at indexes 1, 3, and 5.
- For a string with only one character, such as "a", it would return "a", which is also correct.

Overall, the function behaves as expected for all tested scenarios, fulfilling the problem description's requirements.
