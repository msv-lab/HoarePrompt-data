Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The description specifically asks for a function that removes characters with odd index values from a given string. However, the provided implementation actually retains characters at even indices, which is the opposite of what is required. 

To clarify:

1. The problem description states that characters at odd index values should be removed.
2. The function `func_1` instead constructs a new string from characters at even indices, effectively ignoring odd index characters.

For example, given the input string 'abcdef':
- Expected output (removing odd indices): 'ace' (removing 'b', 'd', 'f')
- Function's output: 'ace' (retaining 'a', 'c', 'e')

Although the function's output matches what was expected in the assertions for those specific test cases, it fundamentally does not align with the specified task of removing characters at odd indices. Therefore, it fails to fulfill the problem description properly across all potential cases.
