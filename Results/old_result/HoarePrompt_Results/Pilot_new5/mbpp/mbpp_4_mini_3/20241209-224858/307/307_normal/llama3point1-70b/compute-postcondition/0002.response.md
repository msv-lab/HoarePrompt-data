The value of `triangular_num` is computed as `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. With `idx` being 1, the calculation becomes `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which evaluates to `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 1, and `triangular_num` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is 1**.
