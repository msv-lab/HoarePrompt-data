To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits.

### Program:
```python
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1
```

### Initial Assessment:
- The function seems to be designed to find the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits.
- The triangular number is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- The loop increments `k` until it finds the first triangular number with exactly `n` digits, at which point it returns `k`.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
1. **Minimum `n` Value**: If `n = 1`, the function should return 1 since the first triangular number is 1 (which has 1 digit).
2. **Large `n` Values**: The function must handle larger values of `n` without running indefinitely. For example, if `n = 10`, it should still find a valid `k`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and finds the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits. The hints agree with the code's functionality.

### Checking the Code Against Output Hints:
- The function is expected to return `k` when it finds a triangular number with exactly `n` digits.
- The assertions provided are consistent with the definition of triangular numbers:
  - For `n = 2`, the triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, and the first with 2 digits is 10, which corresponds to `k = 4`.
  - For `n = 3`, the first triangular number with 3 digits is 105, corresponding to `k = 14`.
  - For `n = 4`, the first triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, corresponding to `k = 45`.

### Conclusion:
The code indeed seems to handle the requirements of the problem description correctly. The output hints corroborate the logic in the code, and there are no edge cases presented that would lead to incorrect behavior for the range of positive integers typically expected in this context. 

However, we realize the function doesn't explicitly handle the case when `n = 1`, which is actually valid since the first triangular number (1) has 1 digit. The absence of this handling could lead to an infinite loop scenario if the input is `1`, because the while loop will never be satisfied.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, there exists at least one case (when `n = 1`) which the program does not handle correctly, therefore:

Correctness: **False**.
