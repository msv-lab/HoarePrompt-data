Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Specifically, it finds the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The program calculates the triangular number using the formula `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, which is correct for generating triangular numbers.

2. **Digit Count Check**: It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n` using `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`. This correctly identifies whether the triangular number has at least `n` digits.

3. **Infinite Loop Until Condition Met**: The use of a `while True` loop allows the function to continue iterating until it finds a triangular number that meets the digit requirement. This ensures that it will eventually return an index as long as `n` is a positive integer, which aligns with the problem's stipulation.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the index (`idx`) of the first triangular number that meets the condition, which is exactly what the problem requires.

There are no scenarios in which the provided code would fail to return the correct index for positive integer inputs for `n`, making it a correct implementation.
