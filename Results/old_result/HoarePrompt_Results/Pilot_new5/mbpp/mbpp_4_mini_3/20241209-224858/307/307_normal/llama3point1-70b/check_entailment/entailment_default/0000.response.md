Initially, let's analyze the provided code and its relationship to the problem description. The problem description states that the function should find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. 

The code iteratively calculates triangular numbers using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` and checks the length of each triangular number against the required digit count `n`. If the length of the triangular number is at least `n`, it returns the index `idx`. 

In examining the logic of the code, it appears to follow the problem description accurately. The while loop continues until a triangular number with at least `n` digits is found, and there seems to be no upper limit on `n` that would cause the program to fail.

Next, let's consider potential edge cases:
1. If `n` is 1, the first triangular number is 1 (which has 1 digit), and the function should return 1. This is correctly handled by the code.
2. If `n` is larger, for example, 2, the first triangular number with at least 2 digits is 3 (triangular index 2). The code continues to work correctly.
3. The output hints mention that the function could run indefinitely if `n` is excessively large. However, triangular numbers grow fairly quickly, so even for larger values of `n`, the function should eventually find a triangular number.

Now let's analyze the output hints. They state that the function will calculate the index of the first triangular number with at least `n` digits and note that there isn't a cap on `n`, implying that extreme values for `n` could lead to prolonged execution times. However, they do not indicate that the function can fail to find a number within any reasonable constraint of `n`.

In summary, after reviewing both the code and the output hints:
- The code correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.
- The output hints align well with the code's functionality.

Since I can't find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
