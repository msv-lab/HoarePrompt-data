The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was 1, so after execution, `idx` will be 2. No other variables are affected by this operation, and the other conditions regarding `n` and `triangular_num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
