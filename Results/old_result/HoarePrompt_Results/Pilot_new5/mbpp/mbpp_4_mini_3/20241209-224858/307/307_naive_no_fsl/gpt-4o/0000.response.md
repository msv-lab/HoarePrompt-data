To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description, which is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

**Triangular Numbers:**
A triangular number for a natural number `k` is given by the formula:
\[ T(k) = \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \]
The goal is to find the smallest `k` such that `T(k)` has exactly `n` digits.

**Program Logic:**
1. The program initializes `k` to 1 and enters an infinite loop.
2. Inside the loop, it calculates the triangular number for the current `k`.
3. It checks the length of the string representation of this triangular number.
4. If the length matches `n`, it returns `k` (the index).
5. If not, it increments `k` and repeats the process.

**Analysis of Provided Assertions:**
- `func_1(2) == 4`: The smallest triangular number with 2 digits is `10`, which corresponds to `k = 4` since \( T(4) = 10 \).
- `func_1(3) == 14`: The smallest triangular number with 3 digits is `105`, corresponding to `k = 14` since \( T(14) = 105 \).
- `func_1(4) == 45`: The smallest triangular number with 4 digits is `220`, which corresponds to `k = 20` since \( T(20) = 210 \), but \( T(20) = 210 \), so this assertion is incorrect.

**Finding an Issue:**
The assertion `func_1(4) == 45` is incorrect because the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is actually `1000`, which corresponds to `k = 45` since \( T(45) = 1035 \). Therefore, the program fails to provide the correct return value for this case.

**Conclusion:**
Since the program does not consistently deliver the expected result for the defined problem description in at least one case, we conclude that it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
