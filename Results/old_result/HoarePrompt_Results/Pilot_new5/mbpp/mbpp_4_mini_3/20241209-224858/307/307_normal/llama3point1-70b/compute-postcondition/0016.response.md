The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that the previous value of `idx` is 3, the new value of `idx` becomes 4. The states of the other variables, including `n` and `triangular_num`, are still valid as described.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `triangular_num` is 6, `idx` is 4.**
