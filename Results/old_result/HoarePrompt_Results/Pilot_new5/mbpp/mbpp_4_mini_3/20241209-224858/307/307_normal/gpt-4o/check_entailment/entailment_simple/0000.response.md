Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits.

2. **Triangular Number Calculation**: Within the function, the triangular number is calculated using the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), which is correct for generating triangular numbers.

3. **Digit Count Check**: The program checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns `k`, which is the index of that triangular number.

4. **Looping Logic**: The program uses an infinite loop (`while True`) to increment `k` starting from 1, ensuring that it continues to generate triangular numbers until it finds one with the desired number of digits.

5. **Tests**: The assertions provided (i.e., `assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) are correct based on known triangular numbers:
   - The 4th triangular number (for n=2) is 10, which has 2 digits.
   - The 14th triangular number (for n=3) is 105, which has 3 digits.
   - The 45th triangular number (for n=4) is 990, which has 4 digits.

Since all the logic aligns well with the problem requirements and the assertions validate the correctness of the function for the specified cases, it can be concluded that the program accurately finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

Thus, the correctness statement holds true.
