According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken. Therefore, we do not need to make any adjustments to the state to allow for another iteration of the loop. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
