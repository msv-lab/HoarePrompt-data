#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cone calculated using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \) where radius and height are non-negative numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of a cone calculated using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). However, if either `radius` or `height` is negative, the function would still perform the calculation without error handling, potentially leading to unexpected results, as the mathematics of volume for negative dimensions is not defined in this context.
