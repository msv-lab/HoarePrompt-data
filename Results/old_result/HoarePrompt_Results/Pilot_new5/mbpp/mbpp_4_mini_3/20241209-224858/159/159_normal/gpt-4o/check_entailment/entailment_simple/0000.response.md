Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to calculate the volume of a cone as specified in the problem description. The formula used in the function `func_1(radius, height)` is \( \frac{1}{3} \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \), which is the standard mathematical formula for the volume of a cone. 

The assertions provided in the annotated program test the function with various inputs (radius and height) to ensure that it returns the expected volume within a relative tolerance. Given that the function is defined to operate with non-negative values for radius and height, it adheres to the constraints typically assumed for such geometric calculations.

Thus, the implementation consistently adheres to the problem description, ensuring that it calculates the volume of a cone accurately for the provided inputs.
