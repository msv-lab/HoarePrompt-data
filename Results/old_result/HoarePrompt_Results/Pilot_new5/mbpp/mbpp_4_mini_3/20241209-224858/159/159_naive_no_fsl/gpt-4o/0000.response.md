Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(radius, height)` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The function takes the radius and height as inputs and computes the volume correctly.

The assertions provided test the function with various radius and height values, confirming that it returns the expected results for those cases. 

I have considered edge cases, such as:
1. **Zero Radius**: If the radius is 0, the volume should also be 0, which the function handles correctly (i.e., `func_1(0, h)` returns 0 for any height `h`).
2. **Negative Radius or Height**: The volume of a cone cannot be negative. However, the function does not handle negative inputs. This could be viewed as a potential issue depending on how the function is expected to handle such cases.
3. **Non-numeric Inputs**: The function does not explicitly handle non-numeric inputs, which could lead to a TypeError.

Despite these considerations, the function fulfills the primary requirement of calculating the volume of a cone accurately for positive numerical inputs, which are the focus of the given assertions. 

Therefore, since I cannot find a specific case where the program does not work as expected for valid inputs based on the problem description, the code is deemed correct.
