Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement to remove all whitespaces from a string. The function `func_1(s)` uses `s.replace(' ', '')`, which only removes spaces (' ') from the string. However, there are other types of whitespace characters in Python, such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and others, which are not removed by this code.

For example, if the input string is `'python\tprogram'`, the function would return `'python\tprogram'` instead of the expected `'pythonprogram'`. Thus, it fails to meet the requirement of removing all whitespace characters as stated in the problem description.
