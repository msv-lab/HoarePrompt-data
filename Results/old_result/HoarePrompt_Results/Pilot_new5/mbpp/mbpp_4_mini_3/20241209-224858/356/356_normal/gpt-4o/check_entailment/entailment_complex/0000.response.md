Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only removes spaces (' ') from the string and does not account for all types of whitespace characters. According to the problem description, the function must remove all whitespace, which includes spaces, tabs, newlines, and other whitespace characters. The use of `s.replace(' ', '')` will leave other whitespace characters intact, failing to meet the requirement of removing all whitespace from the string. 

For example, if the input string contains tabs or newlines, those characters will not be removed, demonstrating that the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements. A correct implementation would need to use a method that removes all types of whitespace, such as using the `str.replace()` method in conjunction with `str.split()` and `str.join()` or employing regular expressions.
