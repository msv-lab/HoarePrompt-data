Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to remove all whitespaces from a string using the `replace` method. The test cases given in the assertions check various scenarios of whitespace occurrences, including leading, trailing, and multiple consecutive spaces. In all these cases, the expected output matches the actual output of the function. Therefore, the function meets the problem description requirements for all potential cases.
