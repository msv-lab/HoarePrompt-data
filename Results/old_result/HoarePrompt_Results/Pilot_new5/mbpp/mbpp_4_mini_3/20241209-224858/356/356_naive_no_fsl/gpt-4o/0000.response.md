Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is designed to remove all whitespace characters (specifically spaces) from a given string. The implementation uses the `replace` method to replace every space (' ') with an empty string (''), effectively removing them. 

All provided assertions correctly test the function with varying amounts of whitespace, and the function produces the expected outputs in these cases. The use of `s.replace(' ', '')` ensures that every space is removed, regardless of how many there are or their position in the string.

To further confirm correctness, let's consider additional test cases:
1. Input: `''` (an empty string) - Expected output: `''` (remains empty)
2. Input: `'     '` (a string of only spaces) - Expected output: `''` (all spaces removed)
3. Input: `'Hello,  World!'` - Expected output: `'Hello,World!'` (only the space between "Hello," and "World!" is removed)
4. Input: `'    Python   is  great!   '` - Expected output: `'Pythonisgreat!'` (spaces before, between, and after words are removed)

In all these potential cases, the implementation behaves as expected, supporting the conclusion that the code is correct. Since I could not find a single example where the program does not work as described, the program fulfills the requirement of removing all whitespaces from a string.
