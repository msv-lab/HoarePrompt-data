Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is intended to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it does not achieve this. Instead, it only constructs a new string containing uppercase characters. 

For example, if we input the string "Hello World", the expected output should be "H W" (removing all lowercase letters). However, the program will return "HW" which does not preserve spacing or the structure of the original string. 

Another example is the input "abcDEF", where the expected output should be "DEF", but the program would return "DEF" as well, which seems correct at first. However, the program fails to handle cases where the lowercase letters are mixed with uppercase letters properly when spaces or special characters are involved.

Thus, since the program does not fulfill the requirement of removing all lowercase substrings while maintaining the structure of the string, it is incorrect.
