Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the requirement to remove lowercase substrings from a given string by using a list comprehension to filter out characters that are not uppercase. The provided assertions check various cases, and all of them are expected outputs based on the function's logic. 

Hereâ€™s how the function works for the provided test cases:
- For 'PYTHon', the output is 'PYTH' (removes 'on').
- For 'FInD', the output is 'FID' (removes 'n').
- For 'STRinG', the output is 'STRG' (removes 'in').

In all cases, the function behaves as described in the problem statement by correctly filtering out lowercase characters. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail according to the description.
