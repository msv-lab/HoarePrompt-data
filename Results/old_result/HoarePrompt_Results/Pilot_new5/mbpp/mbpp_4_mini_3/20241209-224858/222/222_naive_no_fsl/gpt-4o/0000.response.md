Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it does not handle some cases as described in the problem. 

For example, consider the input string "aBcDeFg". The expected behavior of the program should be to remove all lowercase letters from the string, resulting in "BDF". However, the program would return "BCDF", which incorrectly retains the 'C' and 'D' as uppercase letters that were not part of the original lowercase substrings.

Additionally, the program does not adequately handle cases where the string consists solely of lowercase letters. For instance, for the input "abc", the expected output should be an empty string "", but the program would return an empty string as expected. 

However, since the program is supposed to remove all lowercase letters and return only the uppercase letters, it should also handle cases of mixed and additional substrings more comprehensively.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the correctness of the program is False.
