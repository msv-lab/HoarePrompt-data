Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program only collects and returns uppercase characters from the input string, effectively ignoring any lowercase characters. 

For instance, if the input string is "Hello World", the expected output should be "H W" (removing lowercase letters), but the function will return "HW". Furthermore, if the input string is "abc", the expected output should be empty (since it only contains lowercase letters), but the function will return an empty string as well. 

The critical issue is that the problem description specifically requires the removal of lowercase substrings, while the provided program does not remove any characters at all; it simply filters for uppercase ones. Thus, the program does not align with the problem requirements.
