Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string, but the program instead constructs and returns a string that contains only the uppercase characters from the input string. 

This means that the program does not remove any lowercase substrings; it simply ignores them and returns only the uppercase ones. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected behavior as per the problem description would be to remove the lowercase letters and return an empty string or a string that only consists of uppercase letters if that's explicitly required. However, in the current implementation, the output would be "HW", which is not what the problem description asks for.

In summary, the program does not align with the problem description's requirement to remove lowercase substrings, thus it is incorrect.
