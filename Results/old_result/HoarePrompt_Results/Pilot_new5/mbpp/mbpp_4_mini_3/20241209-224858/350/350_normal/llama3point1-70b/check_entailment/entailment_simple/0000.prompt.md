You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of sorted integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of sorted integers, `target` is an integer, and if `target` is not found in `arr`, the loop will have executed `len(arr)` times. If `target` is found, the loop will return the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` (if duplicates exist), otherwise, the output index will be None, and `i` will be -1 after all iterations.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target is not found in the list 'arr', and the loop has executed len(arr) times, resulting in index 'i' being -1 after all iterations.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
