The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `x`. `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and it contains at least one integer. `x` is an integer for which the function is finding the last position in `arr`. 

Based on the provided output cases, the functionality of `func_1` can be described as follows:

- **Case 1**: If the list `arr` has at least one integer, the function returns the index `i`, which is initialized to the length of `arr` minus 1.

- **Case 2**: If `arr` contains at least one integer, the function may return the value of `i`, which is equal to the length of `arr` minus 2.

- **Case 3**: If `arr` contains at least three integers, the function may return `i`, which is equal to the length of `arr` minus 3.

- **Case 4**: If the integer `x` does not exist in the sorted list `arr`, the function returns -1 to indicate its absence.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`, and return the last position of `x` in the list, or -1 if `x` is not present in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`, returning the last index of `x` in `arr`, or -1 if `x` is not found.**
