You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0
assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2
assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and x is an integer for which the last position in arr needs to be found.
def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer. If `x` is found in `arr`, the loop will set `i` to the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is not found in `arr`, `i` will be -1, indicating that `x` does not exist in the list.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the integer 'x' does not exist in the sorted list 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. It returns the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`, or -1 if `x` is not found. The function correctly handles cases where `x` appears multiple times, once, or not at all in the list. If `arr` is empty, it will also return -1, as there would be no elements to find `x` in.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
