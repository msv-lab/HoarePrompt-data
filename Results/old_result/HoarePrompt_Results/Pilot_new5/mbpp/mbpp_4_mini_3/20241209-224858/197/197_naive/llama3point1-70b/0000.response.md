Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple. It iterates through each element in the list and uses the `count()` method of the tuple to find how many times that element appears in the tuple. The results are summed up to provide the final count, which matches the requirements of the problem description. 

All potential cases, including edge cases such as an empty list or an empty tuple, are handled correctly by this implementation. For example:
- If `tup` is an empty tuple and `lst` is an empty list, the result will be 0, which is correct.
- If `tup` contains elements not found in `lst`, those elements will simply not contribute to the count, which is also correct.

Thus, I see no cases where this program does not work as expected based on the description provided.
