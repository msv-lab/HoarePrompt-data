The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elements`. The parameter `tup` is a tuple, and the parameter `elements` is a list that can contain elements of any type. After executing the function body, it returns the total occurrences of the elements in the list `elements` that are found in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and return the count of how many times the elements of `elements` appear in `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, returns the total occurrences of elements in `elements` that are found in `tup`.**
