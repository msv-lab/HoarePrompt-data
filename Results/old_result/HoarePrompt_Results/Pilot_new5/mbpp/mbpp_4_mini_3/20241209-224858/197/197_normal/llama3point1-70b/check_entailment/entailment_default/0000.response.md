To evaluate the provided Python program against the problem description, we start by analyzing the code and identifying its functionality:

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

### Code:
```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))
```

### Initial Assessment:
The code iterates through each element in the list `lst`, counts how many times that element appears in the tuple `tup` using `tup.count(element)`, and sums these counts to produce a total. 

**Key points to consider:**
1. If an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` will return `0`, which aligns with the requirement to count all occurrences (including those that are absent).
2. The function should return the total count of all occurrences, which matches the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: If `lst` is empty, the function should return `0` because there are no elements to count.
2. **Empty Tuple**: If `tup` is empty, the function should also return `0` regardless of the contents of `lst`, as there are no occurrences of any elements to count.

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and it returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`. If an element in `lst` does not appear in `tup`, it contributes zero to the count, ensuring that all elements are accounted for in the final total. 

This aligns well with the logic in the code.

### Final Evaluation:
The code correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. It handles the cases of empty lists and tuples appropriately, as well as counts occurrences correctly. There are no edge cases identified where the function would fail based on the description.

Correctness: **True**. 

**Explanation**: The program successfully counts occurrences of all elements in the list within the tuple, including handling elements not present in the tuple by returning zero. It also correctly returns zero for empty lists and tuples, satisfying all specified requirements.
