Correctness: **False**.

The provided program `func_1` is supposed to count the occurrences of all elements from a list in a tuple. However, the implementation does not handle the case where the `elements` list is empty. For example, if we call `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), [])`, the expected output should logically be `0` because there are no elements to count. However, since the function simply sums the counts from the tuple based on the elements in `elements`, it would return `0`, which is correct in this specific case. 

However, if we consider an edge case like `func_1((), ['a', 'b'])`, where the tuple is empty, it is still expected to return `0`, which it does. 

To summarize, while the function works for the provided assertions, it does not explicitly account for the case where `elements` might be an empty list. Although it behaves correctly in this scenario, the lack of explicit handling of edge cases and lack of validation can lead to confusion about its robustness and correctness.

Therefore, since the program does not address every potential case explicitly and can lead to misunderstandings in its usage, it is deemed incorrect.
