To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description
The function is supposed to count the occurrences of all elements of a list (`lst`) in a tuple (`tup`).

### Program Analysis
The function works by using a generator expression within the `sum()` function. It iterates over each element in `lst` and counts how many times that element appears in `tup` using the `count()` method.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Empty Tuple and Empty List**:
   - Input: `func_1((), [])`
   - Expected Output: `0` (since there are no elements in both the tuple and the list).
   - The function will correctly return `0`.

2. **Empty Tuple with Non-Empty List**:
   - Input: `func_1((), [1, 2, 3])`
   - Expected Output: `0` (none of the elements in the list can be found in the empty tuple).
   - The function will correctly return `0`.

3. **Non-Empty Tuple with Empty List**:
   - Input: `func_1((1, 2, 3), [])`
   - Expected Output: `0` (there are no elements in the list to count).
   - The function will correctly return `0`.

4. **Elements Not Present**:
   - Input: `func_1((1, 2, 3), [4, 5])`
   - Expected Output: `0` (none of the elements in the list are found in the tuple).
   - The function will correctly return `0`.

5. **Count of Elements Present**:
   - Input: `func_1((1, 2, 1, 2, 3), [1, 2])`
   - Expected Output: `4` (two occurrences of `1` and two of `2`).
   - The function will correctly return `4`.

6. **Duplicates in List**:
   - Input: `func_1((1, 2, 3), [1, 1, 2])`
   - Expected Output: `3` (one occurrence of `1` and one of `2`).
   - The function will correctly return `2`.

After considering these cases, the function correctly counts the occurrences of all elements of the list in the tuple.

### Conclusion
Throughout the analysis, I did not find any examples where the function fails to meet the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
