Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two arguments: a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. The function counts the occurrences of each element in the list `lst` within the tuple `tup` and returns the total count.

Here's the breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Types**: The function properly handles input types by specifying that `tup` is a tuple and `lst` is a list. The comments clarify this input structure.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The expression `tup.count(element)` effectively counts how many times a particular `element` from `lst` appears in `tup`. This works for all elements in `lst`, including those that do not appear in `tup`, where it will naturally return 0.

3. **Summation**: The use of `sum()` on the generator expression ensures that all counts are accumulated correctly. If an element does not exist in `tup`, it contributes 0 to the total count, which aligns with the stated requirement of counting occurrences.

4. **Final Return**: The function returns the total count, which matches the problem's requirement to count the occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple.

Since the function meets the problem description by counting all occurrences of list elements in the tuple and returning the correct total, it is correct.
