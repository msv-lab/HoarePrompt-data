Correctness: **True**

The provided program checks whether a specified list is sorted by comparing the list `nums` with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Empty List**: An empty list is considered sorted, and `sorted([])` returns an empty list, so the function will return `True`.
   
2. **Single Element List**: A list with a single element is also considered sorted. For instance, `func_1([1])` returns `True`, since `[1]` is equal to `sorted([1])`.

3. **Sorted Lists**: For any list that is already sorted (like `[1, 2, 3]` or `['a', 'b', 'c']`), the function will return `True`, as it correctly identifies that the list matches its sorted version.

4. **Unsorted Lists**: In cases where the list is unsorted (like `[3, 1, 2]`), the function will return `False`, since the original list does not match the sorted version.

5. **Mixed Data Types**: The function assumes that all elements in the list are comparable. If the list contains mixed types that cannot be compared (like integers and strings), this will raise a `TypeError` in Python 3, which is acceptable behavior since the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases.

Since the function behaves as expected across all these cases and meets the problem requirements, it is correct.
