Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether the specified list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The logic iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the subsequent element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If no such pair is found, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The test cases provided confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- The first test case checks a sorted list and returns `True`, which is correct.
- The second and third test cases check unsorted lists and return `False`, which is also correct.

Additionally, the function correctly handles edge cases, such as:
- An empty list, which is considered sorted and would return `True`.
- A list with a single element, which is also considered sorted and would return `True`.

Since there are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
