Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the requirement from the problem description, which is to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Logic**: The function iterates through the list and compares each element to the next one. If any element is found that is greater than the next, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

2. **Return Value**: If the loop completes without finding any violations of the sorted order, the function returns `True`. This means that all elements have been found to be in non-decreasing order.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases properly:
   - If the list is empty (`[]`) or has only one element (e.g., `[1]`), the loop does not execute. Since an empty list or a single element list is considered sorted, the function correctly returns `True` in these cases.

4. **Assertions in Place**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests to verify that the function behaves correctly for both sorted and unsorted cases:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True`, confirming that this sorted list is correctly identified as sorted.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` and `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` both return `False`, indicating that these unsorted lists are correctly identified as not sorted.

Overall, the function meets the problem description requirements for all potential cases, confirming its correctness.
