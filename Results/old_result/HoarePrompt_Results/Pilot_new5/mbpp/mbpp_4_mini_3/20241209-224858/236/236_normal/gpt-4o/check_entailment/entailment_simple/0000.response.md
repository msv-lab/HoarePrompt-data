Correctness: **True**

The program implements a function `func_1(lst)` that checks whether a specified list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Here's how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Iterating through the List:** The function uses a loop to iterate through the list elements, comparing each element `lst[i]` with the next element `lst[i + 1]`.

2. **Condition for Sorted List:** Inside the loop, if any element is found that is greater than the subsequent element (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), the function immediately returns `False`. This behavior is consistent with the requirement of determining if the list is sorted, as a sorted list cannot have any pair of elements where a larger element precedes a smaller one.

3. **Returning True for Sorted Lists:** If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. This is appropriate because, if no violations of the sorted order are found, the only conclusion left is that the list is indeed sorted.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:** The function inherently handles edge cases correctly:
   - If the list is empty or contains a single element, the loop does not execute, and the function will return `True`, which is correct since an empty list or a single-element list is considered sorted.

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests that affirm the correctness of the function for various scenarios, including already sorted lists and unsorted lists.

Thus, the function `func_1` meets the requirements set forth in the problem description to check whether a specified list is sorted, making the program correct.
