Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `nums` and returns True if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle cases where `nums` is empty or contains only one element, but in these cases, the function still correctly identifies that an empty list or a single-element list is sorted. **
