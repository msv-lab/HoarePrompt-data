The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of comparable elements. It checks the elements in the list and has four distinct cases for the return values. 

- Case 1: If any element `lst[i]` is greater than the next element `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns `False`.
- Case 2: The function returns `False` under certain unspecified conditions, but it indicates that an error or undesired condition was met.
- Case 3: Similar to Case 2, the function returns `False` under another unspecified condition.
- Case 4: If the list meets the conditions for the loop, confirming that it is sorted and contains at least two elements, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` of comparable elements and determine if the list is sorted in ascending order with at least two elements, returning `True` if it is sorted and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lst`, a list of comparable elements, and returns `True` if `lst` is sorted and contains at least two elements; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
