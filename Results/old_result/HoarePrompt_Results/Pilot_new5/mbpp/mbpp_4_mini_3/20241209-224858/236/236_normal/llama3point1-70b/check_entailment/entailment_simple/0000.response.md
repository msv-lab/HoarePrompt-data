Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the specified functionality of checking whether a list is sorted or not. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(nums)` is defined to accept a single parameter, `nums`, which is expected to be a list of comparable elements, as stated in the annotated comment.

2. **Sorted Check**: The program compares the original list `nums` with the result of `sorted(nums)`. The `sorted()` function returns a new list that contains all elements from `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Return Value**: 
   - If `nums` is already sorted, `nums` will be equal to `sorted(nums)`, which will return `True`.
   - If `nums` is not sorted, `nums` will not be equal to `sorted(nums)`, which will return `False`.

4. **Correctness Across Cases**: 
   - The function considers all potential cases, such as an empty list (which is trivially sorted), a list with one element (also sorted), and lists with multiple elements in various orders (sorted and unsorted).

Therefore, the program correctly checks whether the list is sorted and adheres to the requirements specified in the problem description.
