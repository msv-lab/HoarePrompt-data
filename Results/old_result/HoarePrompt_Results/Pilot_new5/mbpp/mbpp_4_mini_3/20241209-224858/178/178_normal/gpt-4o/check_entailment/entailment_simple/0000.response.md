To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation:

### Problem Description
The task is to:
1. Round every number in a given list.
2. Calculate the total sum of these rounded numbers.
3. Multiply the total sum by the length of the list.
4. Return the result.

### Annotated Program Analysis
The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
1. It takes a list of numbers as an argument.
2. It uses a list comprehension to round each number in the list (`rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]`).
3. It calculates the sum of the rounded numbers (`total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`).
4. It multiplies this sum by the length of the original list (`result = total_sum * len(numbers)`).
5. Finally, it returns this result.

### Test Cases
The provided assertions test the function with various inputs:
- For the first test case, the rounded numbers are `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`, which sum to `7`. The length of the list is `9`, so the result is `7 * 9 = 63` (but the expected result is `243`, indicating a misunderstanding).
- For the second assertion, the rounded numbers are `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]`, which sum to `69` and the length is `5`, resulting in `69 * 5 = 345`, which is correct.
- The third assertion rounds to `[25, 57, 89]`, summing to `171`, and with a length of `3`, gives `171 * 3 = 513`, which is correct.

### Correctness Assessment
Upon analyzing the first test case, it is evident that the expected output does not match the calculated result based on the described logic. The reasoning for this discrepancy indicates that there may be a misunderstanding in the assertion. The function calculates the correct output based on rounding and summing the numbers before multiplying by the length, but the expected results in the assertions do not align with this logic.

### Conclusion
Since the function does correctly implement the rounding, summing, and multiplication as per the problem description, but the output expectations in the assertions do not validate this logic, we cannot confirm the correctness of the program based on the provided assertions.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the program does not strictly meet the problem description due to the inconsistency in the expected outputs. 

Correctness: **False**
