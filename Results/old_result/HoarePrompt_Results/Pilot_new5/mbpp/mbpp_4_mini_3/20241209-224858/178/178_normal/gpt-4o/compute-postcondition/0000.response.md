The code creates a new list `rounded_numbers` that contains each number from the original list `numbers`, rounded to the nearest integer. The original list `numbers` remains unchanged. The output state reflects the unchanged state of `numbers` and the new list created.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values (integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers resulting from rounding each value in `numbers`.**
