The function accepts a list of numerical values (either integers or floats), rounds each value to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded values, and returns the product of this sum and the length of the original list of numbers. It does not handle cases where the input list is empty, but in such a case, it would return 0 due to multiplying the sum (which would be 0) by the length (also 0).
