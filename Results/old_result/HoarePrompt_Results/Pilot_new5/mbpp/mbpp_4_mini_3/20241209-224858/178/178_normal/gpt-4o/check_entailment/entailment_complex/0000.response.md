Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it fulfills each part:

1. **Rounding Every Number**: The program uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list `numbers` with the expression `rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]`. This ensures that every number is rounded to the nearest integer.

2. **Calculating the Total Sum**: The total sum of the rounded numbers is calculated using `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`, which correctly sums up all the rounded values.

3. **Multiplying by the Length of the List**: The program then multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list with `result = total_sum * len(numbers)`. This is in accordance with the requirement to multiply the sum by the length of the input list.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns this result, which matches the expectation of the problem statement.

5. **Handling Empty List**: If the input list `numbers` is empty, the length will be `0`, causing the final result to be `0` as expected, since the multiplication of any number with `0` results in `0`.

Since all aspects of the problem description are met, the program is considered correct.
