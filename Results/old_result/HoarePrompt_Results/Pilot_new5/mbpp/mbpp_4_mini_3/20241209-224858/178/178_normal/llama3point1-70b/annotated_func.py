#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numerical values (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of total_sum and the length of the list 'numbers', where total_sum is the sum of the rounded values of each element in 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numerical values (either integers or floats), rounds each value to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded values, and returns the product of this sum and the length of the original list of numbers. It does not handle cases where the input list is empty, but in such a case, it would return 0 due to multiplying the sum (which would be 0) by the length (also 0).
