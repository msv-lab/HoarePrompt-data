To evaluate the provided Python program in relation to the problem description and output hints, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Problem Description**: The program should round every number in a given list, calculate the total sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiply this sum by the length of the list. If the list is empty, the function should return 0.

2. **Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(numbers):
       rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
       total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
       result = total_sum * len(numbers)
       return result
   ```

3. **Output Hints**: The function rounds each value, computes the sum of the rounded values, and returns this sum multiplied by the length of the list. If the list is empty, the result will be 0.

### Initial Assessment:
- The program seems to correctly implement the rounding of numbers, summing of those rounded numbers, and multiplying by the length of the list.
- However, we need to consider edge cases such as:
  - An empty list: The length of `numbers` will be 0, so `total_sum * len(numbers)` will correctly return 0, adhering to the specification.
  - Negative numbers and their rounding behavior: The function appears to handle both positive and negative floating-point numbers correctly according to Python's built-in `round()` behavior.

### Output Hints Review:
- The output hints state that the function will handle an empty list by returning 0, which is consistent with how the code behaves.
- The hints also correctly describe the expected behavior for non-empty lists, including the calculations.

### Consideration of Edge Cases:
- All examples provided in the assertions seem to be handled correctly by the function:
  - `func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5])` rounds to `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`, which sums to `27`, and then multiplied by 9 (length of the list) equals `243`.
  - `func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29])` rounds to `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]`, summing to `69`, then multiplied by the length 5 equals `345`.
  - `func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2])` rounds to `[25, 57, 89]`, summing to `171`, then multiplied by 3 equals `513`.

### Conclusion:
After assessing the code against the problem description and output hints, I find no discrepancies or missing logic. The code handles the requirements correctly for all given cases, including the management of an empty list.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly rounds the numbers, sums them, and multiplies by the length of the list, returning the expected results in all tested cases.
