Correctness: **False**.

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it multiplies the sum of rounded numbers by the length of the original list, which is not specified in the problem description. The expected behavior should be to round each number, sum them, and then multiply that sum by the **length of the rounded numbers**, not the original list. 

For example, consider the input `func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29])`. The rounded numbers would be `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]`, which sums to `69`. The length of the rounded numbers is `5`, so the expected output would be `69 * 5 = 345`. 

However, if you take an input such as `func_1([-1.5, -2.5, 0.5])`, the rounded numbers would be `[-2, -2, 1]`, which sums to `-3`. The length of the original list is `3`, so the returned result would be `-3 * 3 = -9`. But if we were to consider the length of the rounded numbers (which is still `3`), the output would be the same, however, the original problem statement could imply a different interpretation.

Thus, since there's a potential misunderstanding in how the lengths are handled, the program is incorrect.
