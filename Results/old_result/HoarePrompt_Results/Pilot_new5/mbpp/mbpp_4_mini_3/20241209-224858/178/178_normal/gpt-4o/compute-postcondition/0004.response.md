The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numerical values, which can be either integers or floats. After executing the function body, it computes the sum of the integers in `rounded_numbers`, denoted as `total_sum`, and multiplies this sum by the length of the list `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numerical values `numbers` and return the product of the sum of the integers from `rounded_numbers` and the length of `numbers`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of numerical values `numbers` and returns the product of the sum of the integers in `rounded_numbers` and the length of `numbers`.**
