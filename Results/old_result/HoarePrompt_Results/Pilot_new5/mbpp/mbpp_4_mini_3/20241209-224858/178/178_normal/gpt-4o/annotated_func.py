#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numerical values (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the product of total_sum, which is the sum of the integers in 'rounded_numbers', and len(numbers), which is the length of the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numerical values `numbers`, rounds each value in the list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded values, and returns the product of this sum and the length of the original list `numbers`. If `numbers` is empty, the function will return 0 because the length will be 0, leading to a product of 0 regardless of the sum.
