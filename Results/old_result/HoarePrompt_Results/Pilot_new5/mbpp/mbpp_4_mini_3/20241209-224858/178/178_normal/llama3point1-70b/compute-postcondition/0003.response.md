The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numerical values, which can be either integers or floats. The function calculates the sum of the rounded values of each element in the list `numbers`, denoted as `total_sum`. It then returns the product of `total_sum` and the length of the list `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numerical values and return the product of the sum of their rounded values and the length of the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of numerical values and returns the product of the sum of the rounded values of the elements in the list and the length of the list.**
