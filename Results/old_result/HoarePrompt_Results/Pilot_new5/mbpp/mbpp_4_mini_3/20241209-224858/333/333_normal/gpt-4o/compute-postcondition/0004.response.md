The `stack` list is updated by appending the value of `char`, which is the first character of `expr`. Since `stack` was initially an empty list, after appending `char`, `stack` will contain one element: `char`. The values of `expr` and `char` remain unchanged, and the information about `stack` is updated to reflect the addition of `char`. 

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a list containing `char`, `char` is the first character of `expr`, and `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs.**
