Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to check if the given expression is balanced in terms of brackets.

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a string `expr` that may contain various types of brackets: parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`.

2. **Using a Stack**: The program utilizes a stack data structure (implemented as a list) to keep track of the opening brackets encountered as it iterates through the string. This is a standard approach for problems involving matching parentheses, as it allows for efficient last-in, first-out (LIFO) checking.

3. **Matching Logic**: 
   - The `matching_pairs` dictionary is used to define which closing bracket corresponds to which opening bracket.
   - When an opening bracket is encountered (i.e., `(`, `{`, or `[`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - When a closing bracket is encountered (i.e., `)`, `}`, or `]`), the program checks if the stack is empty (which would indicate an unmatched closing bracket) or if the top of the stack does not match the expected opening bracket (according to the `matching_pairs` dictionary). If either of these conditions is true, the function returns `False`.

4. **Final Check**: After processing all characters in the string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is empty, it means all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, and the function returns `True`. If there are still unmatched opening brackets in the stack, it returns `False`.

5. **Test Cases**: The assert statements provide test cases that confirm the function behaves as expected:
   - `func_1('{()}[{}]')` returns `True` (balanced).
   - `func_1('{()}[{]')` returns `False` (unbalanced due to unmatched `[`).
   - `func_1('{()}[{}][]({})')` returns `True` (balanced).

Overall, the program systematically checks for balanced brackets and adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, confirming its correctness.
