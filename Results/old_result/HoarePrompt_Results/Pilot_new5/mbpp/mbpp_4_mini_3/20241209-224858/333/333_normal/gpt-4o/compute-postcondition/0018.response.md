According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expr`. The loop iterates over each character in `expr`. If `expr` is a non-empty string, the loop continues to execute for each character until all characters have been processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `char` holds the value of the current character being processed, and `index` indicates its position within `expr`. Since `expr` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time, `index` must be incremented by 1, and `char` must take the value of the next character in `expr`. 

Thus, if `char` is currently the last character in `expr`, the loop will terminate. However, if `char` is not the last character, we need to ensure `expr` has at least one more character to iterate over. Therefore, we need to adjust the `index` and `char` accordingly.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr` at `index`, `index` is incremented by 1**
