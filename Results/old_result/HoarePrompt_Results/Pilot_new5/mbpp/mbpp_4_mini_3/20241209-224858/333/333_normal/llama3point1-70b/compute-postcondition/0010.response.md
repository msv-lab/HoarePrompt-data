Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character of `expression`, `stack` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `brackets`. If `char` is one of the values in `brackets`, the stack is not empty, and the character corresponding to the value popped from the stack matches `char`.***
