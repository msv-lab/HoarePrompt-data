Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the second character of `expression`, and `stack` will either remain empty or contain the character based on its presence in `brackets`. If `char` is in `brackets.values()`, and if `stack` is empty or the character at the top of the `stack` does not match `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.***
