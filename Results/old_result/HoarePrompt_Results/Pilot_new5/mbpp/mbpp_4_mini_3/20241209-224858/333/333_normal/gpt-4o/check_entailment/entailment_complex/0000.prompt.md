You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string that may contain various types of brackets (such as '()', '{}', '[]') which need to be checked for balance.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expr` is a string that may contain various types of brackets, `stack` is empty if the brackets in `expr` are balanced, otherwise `stack` contains the unmatched opening brackets. If `expr` is empty, `stack` remains empty.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if the brackets in 'expr' are balanced (stack is empty), and False if there are unmatched opening brackets (stack is not empty)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `expr` that may contain various types of brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) and checks if they are balanced. It returns True if all brackets are correctly matched and closed; otherwise, it returns False. If there are unmatched opening brackets or closing brackets that do not correspond to any opening brackets, the function will also return False.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
