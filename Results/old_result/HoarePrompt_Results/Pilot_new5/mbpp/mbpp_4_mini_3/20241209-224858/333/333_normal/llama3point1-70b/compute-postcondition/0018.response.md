According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `expression`. The loop will iterate over each character in the `expression`. At the end of the last iteration, `expression` is a non-empty string and `char` is the second character of `expression`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` would need to be the next character in the `expression`, which would be the third character. Therefore, the `expression` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to proceed with one more iteration.

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `expression`, and `stack` may or may not contain the previous character based on its presence in `brackets`**.
