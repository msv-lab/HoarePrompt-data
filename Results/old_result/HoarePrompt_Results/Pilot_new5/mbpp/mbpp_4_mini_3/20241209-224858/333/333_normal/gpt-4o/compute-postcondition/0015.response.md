Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` corresponds to the expected matching state for the next character, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `index` is the position of `char` in `expr`. If the `stack` is empty or the character at the top of the `stack` does not match the expected character for `char`, the function returns False, indicating a mismatch. Otherwise, there is no return value specified.***
