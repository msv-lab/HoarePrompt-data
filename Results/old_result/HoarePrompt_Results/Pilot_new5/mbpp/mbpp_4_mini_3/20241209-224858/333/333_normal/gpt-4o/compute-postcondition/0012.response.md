According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `expr`, which is non-empty. The loop will iterate over each character in `expr`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is one of the characters in `expr`, and the loop has processed it. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that we advance to the next character in `expr`. 

Since `expr` is non-empty, after processing the current `char`, we need to move to the next character. If there are more characters left in `expr`, the loop will execute again. Let's denote the index of the current `char` in `expr` as `index`. The next character will be the one at `index + 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `index` is less than the length of `expr` minus one. 

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` corresponds to the expected matching state for the next character, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `index` is the position of `char` in `expr`**
