Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, the `stack` is updated to include `char`, which corresponds to the next character in `expr` at `index`. Otherwise, if `char` is in `matching_pairs` and the `stack` is either empty or the character at the top of the `stack` does not match the expected character for `char`, the function returns False, indicating a mismatch. If the `stack` contains the expected character, no return value is specified, and the function continues its execution.***
