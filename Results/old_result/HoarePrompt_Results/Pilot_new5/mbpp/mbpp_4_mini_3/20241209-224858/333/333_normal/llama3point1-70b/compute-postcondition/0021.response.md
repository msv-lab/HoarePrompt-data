Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `expression`, and `stack` may or may not contain the previous character based on its presence in `brackets`. If `stack` is empty or the last character popped from `stack` does not match the corresponding bracket for `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no return value is specified.***
