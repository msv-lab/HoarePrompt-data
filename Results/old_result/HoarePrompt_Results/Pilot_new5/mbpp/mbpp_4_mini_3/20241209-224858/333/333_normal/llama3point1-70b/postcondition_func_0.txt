The function accepts a string `expression` containing various types of brackets (parentheses, braces, and brackets) and checks whether they are balanced. It returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order, and `False` if there are any mismatches or unmatched opening brackets. The function handles cases with mixed brackets and returns `False` for any imbalance.
