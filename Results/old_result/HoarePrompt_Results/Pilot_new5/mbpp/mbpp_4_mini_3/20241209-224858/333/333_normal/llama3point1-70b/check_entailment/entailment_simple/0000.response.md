Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to check if a given expression containing parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced. Hereâ€™s how it meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Use of Stack**: The program uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. This is a standard approach for solving the problem of checking balanced expressions, as it allows for the Last In, First Out (LIFO) property needed for matching brackets.

2. **Bracket Mapping**: It defines a dictionary `brackets` to map each type of opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket. This allows the program to easily check if the closing bracket matches the last opened bracket.

3. **Iterating Through Characters**: The program iterates through each character in the input string `expression`. It checks if the character is an opening bracket (and adds it to the stack) or a closing bracket (and checks for a match with the last opened bracket).

4. **Condition for Match**: When encountering a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (which would indicate an unmatched closing bracket) or if the last opened bracket (popped from the stack) does not match the closing bracket. In either case, it returns `False`.

5. **Final Check for Balance**: After processing all characters, the program checks if the stack is empty. If it is empty, it means that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets in the correct order, and it returns `True`. If it still contains unmatched opening brackets, it returns `False`.

With this logic, the program correctly identifies balanced expressions for any possible input string that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces, thus fulfilling the requirements specified in the problem description.
