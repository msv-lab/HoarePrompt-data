According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer and is at least 2, the expression `n - 1` will be at least 1, which ensures that the loop will have one iteration to execute. 

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `i` will take the value of `n - 2`, which means that before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized correctly to the first value of the range. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are as follows: `n` must be at least 2, and `i` should start from 0.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
