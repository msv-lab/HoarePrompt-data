Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is `n - 1`, and an IndexError occurred due to out-of-bounds access. `min_diff` remains positive infinity as the assignment did not take place.**
