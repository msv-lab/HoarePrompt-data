Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement of the problem description, which is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and an integer `n`, where `n` is the length of the array. It checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. Although returning 0 may seem unnecessary for the purpose of finding a minimum difference (as there are not enough elements to find a difference), this does not affect the correctness of the function given that the problem description implies that the input will have at least two elements.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The function sorts the array. This is essential for finding the minimum difference because the smallest difference will occur between consecutive elements in a sorted array.

3. **Finding Minimum Difference**: The function iterates through the sorted array and calculates the difference between each pair of consecutive elements. It keeps track of the minimum difference found during this iteration.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns `min_diff`, which represents the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

5. **Correctness of Outputs**: The assertions provided before the function definition are examples that demonstrate the function works correctly for the given test cases, returning the expected minimum differences.

Therefore, the function accurately solves the problem as specified, and thus, it is correct.
