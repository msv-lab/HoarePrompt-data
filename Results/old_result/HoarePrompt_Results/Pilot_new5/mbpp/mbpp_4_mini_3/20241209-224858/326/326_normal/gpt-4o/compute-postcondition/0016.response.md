In this scenario, the code snippet attempts to assign the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. However, an error occurs due to an index out of range when calculating `diff`. Therefore, the assignment does not take place, and `min_diff` retains its original value of positive infinity. The other variables remain unchanged as well. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `min_diff` remains positive infinity, `i` is `n - 1, and an error occurs due to index out of range when calculating `diff`.**
