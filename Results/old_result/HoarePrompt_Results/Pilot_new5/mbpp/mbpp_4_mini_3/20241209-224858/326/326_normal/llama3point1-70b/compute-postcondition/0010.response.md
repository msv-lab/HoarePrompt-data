Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]` if that difference is less than the previous value of `min_diff`. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is 1, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`.***
