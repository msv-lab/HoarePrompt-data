Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description. The problem asks for the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the program only calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array. 

This approach could lead to incorrect results because the minimum difference may occur between non-consecutive elements. For example, consider the array `[3, 8, 15, 17]`. The differences between consecutive elements are `5` (between `3` and `8`) and `2` (between `15` and `17`), but the absolute difference between `3` and `15` is `12`, which is greater than `5` but could be less than other differences if more elements were present.

Thus, it does not account for all possible pairs in the array, leading to potential inaccuracies in the minimum difference calculation. The function should compare all pairs of elements to ensure that the true minimum difference is found.
