You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, and `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It computes and returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `arr`. The variable `target` is not used in the logic of the function and does not influence the output. Additionally, the function assumes that `arr` contains at least two elements; if `arr` has fewer than two elements, it may lead to an incorrect result or error since the difference calculation requires at least two values.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
