The `arr` variable is now assigned the sorted version of itself. Since `n` is equal to the length of `arr`, it remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is equal to the length of `arr`.**
