The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. Since `diff` is currently less than `min_diff`, the value of `min_diff` will now be equal to `diff`. The other variables remain unchanged, so we reflect that in the output state.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]**
