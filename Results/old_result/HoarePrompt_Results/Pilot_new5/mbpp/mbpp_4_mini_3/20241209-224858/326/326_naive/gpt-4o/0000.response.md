Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where the input array has only one element. According to the problem description, the function should find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. However, if the array has less than two elements (for example, a single-element array like `(1,)`), there are not enough elements to calculate a difference. 

In the current implementation, when `n < 2`, the function returns `0`, which does not provide a meaningful difference since the requirement is to find the minimum difference between two elements. This could lead to misleading results. 

For example, if we call `func_1((1,), 1)`, the function would return `0`, which is incorrect because there's only one element and no difference can be calculated. 

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
