Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The function is supposed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. However, the current implementation only calculates the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the sorted version of the array.

Here are the issues:

1. **Limited Scope of Calculation**: The program only considers differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The minimum difference could occur between non-consecutive elements, which the current implementation does not account for.

2. **Unused Parameter**: The `target` parameter is not utilized in the function, which might be misleading in the context of the problem description. It implies that the function is expected to use it for some purpose.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function makes an assumption that `arr` contains at least two elements. The problem description does not specify that the input will always be valid with at least two elements, and the function does not handle cases where `arr` has fewer than two elements, potentially leading to an error.

Therefore, while the program does compute a minimum difference, it does not align with the broader requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the input array. This is why the correctness is marked as **False**.
