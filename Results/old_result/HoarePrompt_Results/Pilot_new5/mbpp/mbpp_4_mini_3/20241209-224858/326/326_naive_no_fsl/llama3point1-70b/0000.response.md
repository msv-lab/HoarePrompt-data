Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the input array contains fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, the task is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. If the input array has fewer than two elements (e.g., an empty array or an array with a single element), it is impossible to compute a difference between two elements.

For example:
- If the input is `[]` (an empty array), the function will return `inf`, which is not a valid response based on the problem description.
- If the input is `[5]` (an array with a single element), the function will still return `inf`, which is again incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to account for these edge cases, leading to incorrect behavior for valid inputs as described in the problem statement.
