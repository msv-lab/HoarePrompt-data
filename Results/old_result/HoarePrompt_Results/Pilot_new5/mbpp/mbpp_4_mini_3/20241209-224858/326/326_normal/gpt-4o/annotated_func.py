#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is a positive integer such that n == len(arr).
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the current value of n is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is equal to the length of `arr`.
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, and `i` is `n - 1`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns min_diff, which is the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list arr
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` that represents the length of `arr`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or greater, it sorts the list and returns the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list.
