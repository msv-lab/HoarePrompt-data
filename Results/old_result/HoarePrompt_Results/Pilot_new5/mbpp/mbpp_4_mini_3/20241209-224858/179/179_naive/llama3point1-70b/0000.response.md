To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both.

**Problem Description:** Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Requirement:**
   - The task requires calculating the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The first `n` even natural numbers are `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program uses a generator expression within the `sum` function, which iterates over the range from `2` to `n * 2 + 1` with a step of `2` (which generates even numbers).
   - For each even number `i`, it computes `i ** 3` and sums these values.

3. **Verification of the Logic:**
   - If `n = 1`: The first even natural number is `2`. The cube is `2^3 = 8`. The program correctly returns `8`.
   - If `n = 2`: The first two even natural numbers are `2` and `4`. Their cubes are `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`. The program correctly returns `72`.
   - If `n = 3`: The first three even natural numbers are `2, 4, 6`. Their cubes are `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`. The program correctly returns `288`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n = 0`: The first `0` even natural numbers means no numbers to sum, hence the result should be `0`. The range generates no numbers, so the program returns `0`, which is correct.
   - If `n < 0`: The function should ideally handle negative inputs gracefully. However, in Python, the provided implementation will treat negative values as `0` (no iterations occur), returning `0`. While it doesn't cause an error, it may not meet all intended expectations since the problem does not specify behavior for negative `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program behaves correctly for all non-negative integer inputs. It sums the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers as specified, and it correctly handles `n = 0`. However, it does not handle negative inputs explicitly, but since no error occurs, I won't consider this a failure.

Thus, after careful consideration, I find that all potential cases I considered work correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
