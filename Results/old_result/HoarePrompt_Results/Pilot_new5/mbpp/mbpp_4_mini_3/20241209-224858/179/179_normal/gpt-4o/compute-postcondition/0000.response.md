The code creates a list of even numbers by multiplying each integer `i` from `1` to `n` by `2`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, the values will be calculated based on the range provided.

- If `n = 0`, the range will be from `1` to `0`, which means the list will be empty.
- If `n > 0`, the list will include even numbers from `2` to `2 * n`.

The output will change the value of `even_numbers` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `even_numbers` is a list of even numbers from `2` to `2 * n`, or an empty list if `n = 0`.**
