To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(n)`.

The problem asks for the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to the `n`-th even number, which is `2n`. The cubes of these numbers would be calculated as follows:

1. The first even natural number is 2 (which is `2 * 1`).
2. The second even natural number is 4 (which is `2 * 2`).
3. The `n`-th even natural number would be `2n`.

The function is implemented using a generator expression inside the `sum()` function, which generates the cubes of all even natural numbers up to `2n` by iterating through the range from 2 to `2n + 1`, with a step of 2.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the logic in the function:
- `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates all even numbers from 2 to `2n`.
- `(i ** 3 for i in range(...))` computes the cube for each even number generated.
- `sum(...)` adds all the cubes together.

Now let's consider some test cases:
1. For `n = 1`, the even natural number is [2], and therefore the cube sum is \(2^3 = 8\).
2. For `n = 2`, the even natural numbers are [2, 4], and the cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
3. For `n = 3`, the even natural numbers are [2, 4, 6], and the cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).

The function is correctly computing the sums for these cases. 

However, let's check edge cases:
- For `n = 0`, there are no even numbers to sum, and the sum should logically be 0. The program does not explicitly handle `n = 0`, but Python's `sum()` function would return 0 for an empty iterable generated by `range()`, which is correct behavior.

From this analysis, we can conclude that the function correctly implements the expected behavior for all positive integers including the edge case of `n = 0`.

Thus, the program does meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
