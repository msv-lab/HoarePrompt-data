Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to calculate the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Understanding Even Natural Numbers**: The first n even natural numbers can be represented as 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n. The program generates these numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This correctly constructs a list of the first n even natural numbers.

2. **Calculating the Cube and Sum**: The program then computes the sum of the cubes of these even numbers using `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`. This step correctly calculates the cube of each even number and sums them up.

3. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the computed sum `return cube_sum`, which is the expected output.

4. **Assertions for Validation**: The assertions provided (e.g., `assert func_1(2) == 72`) serve as test cases to validate the function. For n=2, the even numbers are 2 and 4, and their cubes are 8 and 64, respectively, giving a sum of 72, which matches the assertion. Similar reasoning applies to the other assertions, confirming that the function behaves as expected for those test cases.

Since the function adheres to the problem description and produces correct outputs for specified inputs, we conclude that it is implemented correctly.
