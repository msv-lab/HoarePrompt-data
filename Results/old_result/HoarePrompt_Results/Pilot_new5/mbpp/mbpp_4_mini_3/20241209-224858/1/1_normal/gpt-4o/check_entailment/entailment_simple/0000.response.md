Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) as input parameters and uses set intersection to find the shared (common) elements between them. This is precisely what the problem description requires.

2. **Output**: The function returns the common elements as a sorted tuple. The problem description does not specify the format of the output (whether it must be a tuple or a list), but it specifically asks for "shared elements." The return type (tuple) is acceptable as it still conveys the necessary information.

3. **Correctness of Test Cases**: The provided assertions test the function against several scenarios, ensuring that it finds common elements accurately:
   - For the input `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`, the shared elements `(4, 5)` are correctly identified.
   - For the input `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 4, 3, 7)`, the shared elements `(3, 4)` are correctly identified.
   - For the input `(11, 12, 14, 13)` and `(17, 15, 14, 13)`, the shared elements `(13, 14)` are correctly identified.

In summary, the function behaves as required by the problem description and accurately finds the shared elements from the given lists, making it correct.
