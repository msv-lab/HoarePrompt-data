Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the shared (common) elements between the two lists.

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function accepts two parameters, which are lists. This aligns with the requirement to work with two lists.

2. **Finding shared elements**:
   - The function converts both lists into sets using `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`. This conversion allows for efficient computation of the intersection.
   - The intersection is computed using the `&` operator, which finds the common elements between the two sets.

3. **Output**: The result is converted back to a tuple using `tuple(...)`, which matches the requirement to return the common elements.

4. **Correctness**: The function will always return the correct shared elements, regardless of the order of the input lists, and it will handle cases where there are no shared elements (returning an empty tuple in such cases).

Thus, the program fulfills the problem description as it effectively finds and returns the shared elements from the provided lists in the required format.
