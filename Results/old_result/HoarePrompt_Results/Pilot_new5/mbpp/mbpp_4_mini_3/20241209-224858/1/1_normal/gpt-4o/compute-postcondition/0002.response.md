The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists that can contain any type of elements. The function identifies the common elements between these two lists, stores them in a set called `common_elements`, and then returns a sorted tuple of these common elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists and return a sorted tuple of the common elements between them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted tuple of the common elements between the two lists.**
