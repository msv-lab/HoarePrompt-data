Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that finds and returns the shared elements from two given lists. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are expected to be lists, as indicated in the annotation.

2. **Finding Shared Elements**: The function utilizes sets to find the intersection of the two lists. By converting both lists into sets (`set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`), the program effectively filters out duplicate elements and finds the common elements.

3. **Return Type**: The use of the intersection operator `&` on the two sets correctly identifies the unique common elements between the two lists. The result is then converted back into a tuple with `tuple(...)`, adhering to the requirement to return a tuple.

4. **Empty Tuple for No Common Elements**: If there are no common elements between the two lists, the intersection will yield an empty set, which is converted to an empty tuple when returned.

Overall, the function's implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description, covering all potential cases, including those where there are no shared elements. Therefore, the correctness of the program stands validated.
