The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the shared or common elements between two lists. It does this by converting each list into a set and then using the intersection operator (`&`) to find unique elements that are present in both sets. The result is then converted back into a tuple.

### Initial Assessment:
The code appears to correctly follow the problem description, which states that it should find the shared elements from the two given lists. The use of sets ensures that duplicate elements are handled appropriately, resulting in a collection of unique common elements. The output being a tuple is also consistent with the requirement.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Lists**: If both lists are empty, the function should return an empty tuple, which it does.
2. **No Common Elements**: If the lists have no shared elements, the function should return an empty tuple, which it does.
3. **Identical Lists**: If both lists are identical, the function should return a tuple containing all elements of the list without duplicates.
4. **Single Element Lists**: If one list contains a single element that is also present in the other list, it should return a tuple with that single element.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints state that the function returns a tuple containing the unique common elements between the two lists, and if there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple. This aligns with the function's logic and behavior, confirming that the hints are valid.

### Conclusion:
Upon evaluating the code against the problem description and considering various edge cases, the implementation appears to fulfill all requirements specified, and the output hints corroborate the function's logic.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly identifies and returns the unique common elements from the two lists as described, and it handles all edge cases appropriately.
