To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1`.

The problem description states that we need to "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." The function attempts to do this by performing a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Types**: The function assumes that the elements of the tuples are compatible for the bitwise AND operation, which typically means they should be integers. If either tuple contains non-integer types (e.g., strings, None, etc.), the operation will raise an error.

2. **Tuple Size**: The function uses `zip(tup1, tup2)`, which means that if the tuples have different lengths, only the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple will be processed. This behavior might not match the expectation of "elementwise" operations where both tuples should have the same size. 

3. **Empty Tuples**: If both tuples are empty, the function will correctly return an empty tuple, which is expected behavior.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**: Consider the following cases for further examination:
   - If `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the function will return `(0, 0)`, which might not be the expected behavior if we require the output to match the length of the longer tuple.
   - If `tup1 = (1, 2)` and `tup2 = (None, 5)`, the operation will fail due to a TypeError when attempting to compute `1 & None`.

### Conclusion:
Because the function does not handle the case where tuples of different lengths are provided and does not handle non-integer types correctly, I can provide examples where it does not work as expected.

**Correctness: False** 

The program fails when given tuples of different lengths or when the elements are not integers (e.g., `tup1 = (1, 2)` and `tup2 = (None, 5)`), which will raise an error. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases.
