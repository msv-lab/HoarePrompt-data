The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both parameters are tuples. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND results of the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two tuples and return a new tuple representing the bitwise AND of their corresponding elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters tup1 and tup2, both of which are tuples, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND results of corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2.**
