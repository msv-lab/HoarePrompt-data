Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that extracts the elementwise tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided program performs a bitwise AND operation on the elements of the two tuples instead of simply returning the elements as tuples.

For example, if we have two tuples:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
```
The program will compute:
```python
(1 & 4, 2 & 5, 3 & 6)  # This will return (0, 0, 2)
```
But according to the problem description, it should simply return the tuples as they are, possibly in an elementwise manner, without any operations on the elements.

Therefore, the program fails to adhere to the problem requirements, making it incorrect.
