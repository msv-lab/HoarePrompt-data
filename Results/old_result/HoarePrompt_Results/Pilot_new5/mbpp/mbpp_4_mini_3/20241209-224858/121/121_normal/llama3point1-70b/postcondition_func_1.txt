The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For `n = 1`, it returns 7. For other values of `n`, it uses a loop to find subsequent Newman-Shanks-Williams primes by checking if numbers greater than or equal to 7 are primes and have a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. The function will continue until it finds the nth prime, returning that value. Additionally, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input might not be a positive integer greater than 0, which could lead to an infinite loop or unexpected behavior.
