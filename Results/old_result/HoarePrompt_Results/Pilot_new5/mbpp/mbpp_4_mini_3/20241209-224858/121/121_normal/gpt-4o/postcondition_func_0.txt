The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1. For any `n` greater than 1, it computes a sequence using the formula `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, where `S0` and `S1` are initialized to 1. The function ultimately returns the value of `S1`, which represents the computed result for the input `n`.
