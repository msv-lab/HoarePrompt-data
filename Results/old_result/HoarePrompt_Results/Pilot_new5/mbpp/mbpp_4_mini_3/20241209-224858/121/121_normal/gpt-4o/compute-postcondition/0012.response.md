`S0` is assigned the value of `S1`, and `S1` is assigned the value of `S_next`. The previous values were `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, and `S_next` is 17. Therefore, after the assignment, `S0` becomes 7 and `S1` becomes 17. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 7, `S1` is 17, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
