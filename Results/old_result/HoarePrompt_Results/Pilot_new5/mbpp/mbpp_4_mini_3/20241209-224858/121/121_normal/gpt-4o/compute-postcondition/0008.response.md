In the given code, `S_next` is calculated using the formula `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`. Let's evaluate the values of `S1` and `S0` based on the initial state:

- `S0` is 1
- `S1` is 3

Now we can compute `S_next`:

```
S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        = 2 * 3 + 1
        = 6 + 1
        = 7
```

The other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `S_next` while retaining the other variables' values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
