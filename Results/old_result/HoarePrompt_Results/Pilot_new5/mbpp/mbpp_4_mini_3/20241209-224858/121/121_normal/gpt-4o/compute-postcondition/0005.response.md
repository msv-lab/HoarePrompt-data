The value of `S_next` is computed using the expression `2 * S1 + S0`. Given that `S1` is 1 and `S0` is also 1, we have `S_next = 2 * 1 + 1`, which evaluates to `S_next = 3`. The values of `n`, `S0`, `S1`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**
