The value of `num` is increased by 1. Since the initial value of `num` is 9, after the operation, `num` becomes 10. The values of `n` and `count` remain unchanged, and the return condition is not affected by the increment of `num`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `count` is increased to 3, and `num` is 10.**
