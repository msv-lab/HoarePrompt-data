The variable `num` is assigned the value of 7. This does not impact the previous values of `n` or `count`, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 7.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 7**.
