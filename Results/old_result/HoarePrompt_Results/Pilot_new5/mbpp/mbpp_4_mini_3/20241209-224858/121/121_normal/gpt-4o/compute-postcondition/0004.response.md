To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop structure. The for loop iterates over a range that starts from 2 and goes up to `n + 1`. 

1. The variable `n` is given as a non-negative integer greater than 1, which means it can take values 2, 3, 4, etc.
2. The loop variable `i` will start at 2 when the loop begins. 

Since `n` is greater than 1, the loop will have valid iterations (i.e., for n = 2, the loop runs for i = 2). 

However, we also need to consider the initial states of `S0` and `S1`. These variables will remain unchanged during the loop execution, but their values at the start could be relevant depending on the loop body (which we don't have). 

To summarize:
- The loop will execute because `n` is greater than 1.
- The initial value of `i` is 2 when the loop starts.

Thus, the state can be represented as follows:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2**
