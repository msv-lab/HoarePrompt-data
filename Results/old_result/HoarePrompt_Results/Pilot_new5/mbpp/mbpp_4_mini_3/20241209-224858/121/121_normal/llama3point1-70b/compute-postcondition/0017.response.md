The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 2, so after executing `count += 1`, its new value becomes 3. The states of the other variables, `n` and `num`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 8.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 8.**
