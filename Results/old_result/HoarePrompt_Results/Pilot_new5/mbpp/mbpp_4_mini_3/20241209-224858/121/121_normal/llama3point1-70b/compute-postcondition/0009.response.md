The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so the new value of `count` will be 2. The other variables `n` and `num` remain unchanged, and the result of `func_1(num)` and the current value of `num` modulo 6 also remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 7; the result of `func_1(num)` is true; the current value of `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5.**
