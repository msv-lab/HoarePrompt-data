The code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with the contents of `list2`. Since `list1` is non-empty and contains at least one element, it will have its last element changed. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`list1` is a list with the last element replaced by `list2`, `list2` is a list.**
