Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` (which is non-empty) and `list2`. It replaces the last element of `list1` with the contents of `list2`. If `list1` is empty (though the precondition states it is non-empty), it would instead assign `list2` to `list1`. The function returns `list1`, which will either have its last element replaced by `list2` or remain unchanged with `list2` assigned to it if it were empty. However, since `list1` is guaranteed to be non-empty, the only applicable behavior is replacing the last element with `list2`.**
