You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two lists and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
assert func_1(['red', 'blue', 'green'], ['yellow']) == ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists. list1 must contain at least one element.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return list1[:-1] + list2
    #The program returns all elements of list1 except the last one concatenated with all elements of list2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list that includes all elements of `list1` except the last one concatenated with all elements of `list2`. It assumes that `list1` contains at least one element; if `list1` has only one element, the result will be `list2` alone. There are no checks for the empty state of `list2`, so `list2` can be empty, resulting in the output being just the modified `list1`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
