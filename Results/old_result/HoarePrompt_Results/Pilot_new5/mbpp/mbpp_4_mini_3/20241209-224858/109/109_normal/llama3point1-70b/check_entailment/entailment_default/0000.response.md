The problem description states that the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. 

Analyzing the code:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        list1 = list2
    return list1
```

1. **Correctness of logic**: 
    - When `list1` is non-empty, the code replaces the last element of `list1` with the contents of `list2`. This part seems correct as it uses slicing to replace the last element.
    - The else clause checks if `list1` is empty, in which case it assigns `list2` to `list1`. However, according to the problem description, `list1` is guaranteed to be non-empty, making this scenario irrelevant.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
    - If `list1` contains only one element, the last element will be replaced by `list2`, which is correct behavior. 
    - If `list2` is empty, the last element of `list1` will be replaced with nothing, essentially removing it, which may not be what was expected based on the problem description.

Considering the output hints:
- The hints state that the function takes in two lists, `list1` (which is non-empty) and `list2`, and that it correctly replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. However, it also mentions that if `list1` were empty, it would instead assign `list2` to `list1`. While this hints at handling an empty `list1`, it is unnecessary since the problem guarantees that `list1` is non-empty.

Given these points, although the function primarily behaves as described, the handling of an empty `list2` (leading to the last element of `list1` being removed) conflicts with standard expectations. This, combined with the ambiguous handling of `list1` in the else clause, introduces a potential inconsistency.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function may not behave correctly when `list2` is empty, as it would remove the last element of `list1`, which does not align with the intention of the problem description that implies replacement rather than deletion.
