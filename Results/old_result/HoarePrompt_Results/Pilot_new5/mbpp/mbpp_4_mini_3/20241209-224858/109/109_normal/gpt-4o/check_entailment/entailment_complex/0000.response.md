The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. According to the problem, the function is supposed to replace the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`). However, the implementation of the function `func_1` does not adhere to this requirement.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Problem Requirement**: The last element of `list1` should be replaced with the entirety of `list2`.
2. **Implementation**: The function currently returns all elements of `list1` except the last one concatenated with all elements of `list2`. This means that the last element of `list1` is not being replaced but rather excluded from the result.

For example:
- If `list1` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `list2` is `[5, 6, 7, 8]`, the function returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, which does not replace the last element (`5` in this case) with the elements of `list2`. Instead, it leaves the last element untouched and appends the elements of `list2`.

Thus, the implementation does not align with the problem description in that it fails to replace the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.

Correctness: **False**
