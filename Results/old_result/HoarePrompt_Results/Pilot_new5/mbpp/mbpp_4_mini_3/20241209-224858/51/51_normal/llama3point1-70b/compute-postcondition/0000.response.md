The code snippet initializes the variable `product` to 1. The contents of the list `numbers` are not affected, and since the list is not empty, the state of `numbers` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers or floats, and `product` is initialized to 1.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats, and `product` is 1**.
