The value of `product` is updated by multiplying it with `num`. Since `num` is equal to the third number in the list `numbers`, `product` becomes `num * num * num`, which is `num^2 * num` or `num^3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third number in the list, `product` is now equal to `num^3`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third number in the list, `product` is equal to `num^3`.**
