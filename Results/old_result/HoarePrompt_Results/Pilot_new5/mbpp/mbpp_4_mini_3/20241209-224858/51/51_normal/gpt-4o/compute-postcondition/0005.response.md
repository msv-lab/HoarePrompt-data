According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least 2 elements, and `num` is the last element in the list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements, and `num` will become the next element in the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 3 elements; `product` is equal to `num` (the next element in the list)**
