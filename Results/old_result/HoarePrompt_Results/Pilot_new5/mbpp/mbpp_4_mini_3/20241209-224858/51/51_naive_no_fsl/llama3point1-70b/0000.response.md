To verify the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the code and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem description:
The task is to write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides that product by the length of the list.

### Program Analysis:
The provided function `func_1` is as follows:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

### Observations:
1. **Empty List Case**: 
   - If the input list `numbers` is empty (`[]`), then `len(numbers)` would be `0`, leading to a division by zero error. This case is not handled in the code.
   
2. **General Case**:
   - For non-empty lists, the function correctly computes the product of all numbers and divides it by the length of the list.

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not account for the case when the input list is empty, it can raise an error in that situation. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

### Reason for Incorrectness:
The program does not handle the empty list case, which would lead to a division by zero error. For instance, calling `func_1([])` would result in an error, violating the requirements of the problem description.
