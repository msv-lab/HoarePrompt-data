#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floats, and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is equal to the product of all elements in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats, and if `numbers` is empty, then `product` remains 1.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the value of product divided by the length of list 'numbers'. If 'numbers' is empty, the program returns 1 divided by 0, which is undefined; otherwise, it returns the average of the product based on the number of elements in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of integers or floats, computes the product of its elements, and returns the product divided by the number of elements in the list. However, if an empty list is provided, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
