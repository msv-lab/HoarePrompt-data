Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. According to the problem description, the function should multiply all the numbers in the list and divide the result by the length of the list.

However, the program contains a significant flaw: it does not handle the case when the list `numbers` is empty. If the list is empty, the function attempts to divide `product` by `len(numbers)`, which would result in a division by zero error (since `len(numbers)` would be 0). This is not handled in the code, making the program incorrect.

Furthermore, the comment in the code suggests that if the list is empty, `product` remains 1, which implies a return value of `1 / 0`, leading to an undefined result. 

Thus, due to the potential for a division by zero error when the list is empty, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
