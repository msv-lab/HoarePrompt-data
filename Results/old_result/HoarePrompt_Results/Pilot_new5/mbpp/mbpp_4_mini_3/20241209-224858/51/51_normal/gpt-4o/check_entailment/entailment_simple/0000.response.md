Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `numbers`, which is stated to be a list of integers or floats. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Product Calculation**: The program initializes a variable `product` to 1 and iterates over each number in the list, multiplying each number to compute the total product. This is done correctly using the loop:
   ```python
   for num in numbers:
       product *= num
   ```
   This correctly represents the multiplication of all numbers in the list.

3. **Division by Length**: After calculating the product, the program divides this product by the length of the list:
   ```python
   result = product / len(numbers)
   ```
   This step matches the requirement to divide the total product by the length of the list.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the calculated result, which is the product divided by the length of the list.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program test the function with different inputs and check if the results are as expected, confirming that the implementation behaves correctly for those cases.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description of multiplying all the numbers in a list and dividing by the length of that list. Therefore, it is correct.
