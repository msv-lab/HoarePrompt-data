The line `product *= num` means that the value of `product` is updated to be the product of its current value and the value of `num`. Since `product` is initially equal to `num`, this results in `product` being equal to `num` multiplied by itself, or `num * num`. The state of `numbers` and the original value of `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second number in the list, `product` is equal to `num * num`.**
