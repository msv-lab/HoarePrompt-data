Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (sublists) as an argument. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist in the `sublists` and retrieves the first element of each sublist (i.e., `sublist[0]`).

Here are the key points confirming the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts a list of lists, which is consistent with the requirement of processing sublists.
  
2. **Element Retrieval**: The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` effectively extracts the first element from each sublist. This directly fulfills the requirement to get the first element of each sublist.

3. **Handling of Empty Sublists**: The function does not have explicit error handling for empty sublists. However, the question does not specify behavior for empty lists, and in practical usage, if any sublist is empty, accessing `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. This could be seen as a limitation of the program, but it's not a violation of the problem description as it does provide a list of first elements when not encountering empty sublists.

In conclusion, the program performs the task as described, assuming well-formed input. Thus, it correctly follows the problem description.
