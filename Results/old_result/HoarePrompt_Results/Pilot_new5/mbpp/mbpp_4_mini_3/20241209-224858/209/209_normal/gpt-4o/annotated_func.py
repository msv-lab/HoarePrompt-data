#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists, where each sublist is non-empty.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist from the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-empty lists `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. However, it assumes that all sublists are non-empty, and if any sublist were to be empty, this would raise an IndexError. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all sublists are indeed non-empty.
