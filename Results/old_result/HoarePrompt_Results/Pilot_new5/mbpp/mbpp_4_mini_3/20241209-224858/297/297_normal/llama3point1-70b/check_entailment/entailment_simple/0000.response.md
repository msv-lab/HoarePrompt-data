Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of elements from the input tuple. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Structure**: The function is designed to accept a tuple of integers with at least two elements, which aligns with the problem statement that indicates the input will always have more than one number (N must be at least 1).

2. **Operation Performed**: The program uses the `zip` function to pair each element of the tuple with its next element (i.e., it creates pairs like (t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3), ..., (t_N, t_{N+1})). 

3. **Output Structure**: The expression `a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` computes the product of each pair, and `tuple(...)` converts the result into a tuple of the expected length N (since there are N products for the N pairs).

4. **Correct Length**: The output is guaranteed to be of length N since each of the products corresponds to one of the N pairs formed from the input tuple.

Thus, the implementation directly follows the requirements of the problem, and therefore the correctness is confirmed as **True**.
