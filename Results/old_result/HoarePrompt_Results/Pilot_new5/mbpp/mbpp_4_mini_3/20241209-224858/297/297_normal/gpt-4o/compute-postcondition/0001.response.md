The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a tuple of numbers with a length of at least 2. The function returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements in the tuple `t`, where each element is calculated as `t[i] * t[i + 1]` for `i` in the range from 0 to `len(t) - 2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of numbers `t` and return a tuple of products of adjacent elements in `t`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of numbers `t` with at least 2 elements and returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements in `t`.**
