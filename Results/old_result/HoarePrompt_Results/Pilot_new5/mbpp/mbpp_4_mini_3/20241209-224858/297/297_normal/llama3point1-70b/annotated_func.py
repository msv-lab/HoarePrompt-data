#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a tuple of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of integers from the tuple 'numbers', where 'numbers' has at least two elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of integers `numbers` with at least two elements and returns a tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of integers from `numbers`. It does not handle cases where `numbers` has fewer than two elements, as it assumes there will always be at least two elements. Therefore, it may raise an error if called with an invalid input.
