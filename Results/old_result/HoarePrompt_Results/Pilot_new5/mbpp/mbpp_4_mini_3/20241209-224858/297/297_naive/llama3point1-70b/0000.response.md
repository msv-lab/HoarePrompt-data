To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we can analyze the function carefully.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to accept a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and return a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the resulting tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))
```

### Analysis:
1. The function uses `zip()` to pair each element of the input tuple with the next element. This is appropriate for calculating products of consecutive elements.
2. The expression `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` creates a generator that computes the product of each pair `(a, b)` where `a` is an element from the original tuple and `b` is the next element.
3. The use of `tuple()` around the generator expression correctly converts the generated products into a tuple.

### Checking for Edge Cases:
- **Minimum Input:** If we provide an input tuple with only one element, e.g., `(5,)`:
  - The expected output should be an empty tuple `()`, since there are no pairs to multiply.
  - The current implementation will return an empty tuple as `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` will yield no pairs.
  
- **General Case:** For a tuple with two elements, e.g., `(3, 4)`, the function computes `3 * 4` resulting in `(12,)`, which is correct.

- **Negative and Zero Values:** For an input like `(2, 0, 3)`:
  - The output should be `(2 * 0, 0 * 3)` which results in `(0, 0)`, and this is correctly handled.

- **Large Input:** For a tuple with more elements, e.g., `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the output would be `(1 * 2, 2 * 3, 3 * 4)`, resulting in `(2, 6, 12)`, which is also correctly handled.

### Conclusion:
The function handles all typical cases, including edge cases such as single-element tuples. Since it correctly implements the requirement of the problem description for all inputs considered, I find no example where it fails to meet the specifications.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**.
