Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input tuple contains fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, it should return a tuple of length N where N is the length of the input tuple minus one. Therefore, if the input tuple has only one element (or is empty), it should return an empty tuple. However, the assertion `assert func_1((12,)) == ()` is not an explicit test of the function but rather an indication that the function is expected to return an empty tuple for such cases. 

The function will return an empty tuple for an input tuple with a single element, which aligns with the output expected in the assertion. However, there are no checks in place for input that is not a tuple or has fewer than two elements, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in practice. 

For example, if you call `func_1(())`, the function will execute without errors but return an empty tuple, which is correct according to the current code logic. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle empty input explicitly. 

Thus, while the given test cases work and the function's logic seems correct, the lack of input validation and potential handling of edge cases (like an empty tuple or a single-member tuple) leads to the conclusion that the program is not entirely correct under all potential input cases.
