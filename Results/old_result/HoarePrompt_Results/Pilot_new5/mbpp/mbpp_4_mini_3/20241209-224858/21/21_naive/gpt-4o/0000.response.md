Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the function to find the smallest number in a list using Python's built-in `min` function. It handles various test cases, including lists of different lengths and values. The assertions confirm that the function returns the expected smallest values for those lists. Since there are no edge cases (like empty lists or non-numeric values) that the program does not handle mentioned in the problem description, and it works correctly for the given test cases, the program is considered correct.
