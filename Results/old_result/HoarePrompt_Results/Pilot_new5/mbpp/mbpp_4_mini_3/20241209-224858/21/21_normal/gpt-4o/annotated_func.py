#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of numbers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'lst' of numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers `lst` and returns the minimum value from that list. However, if `lst` is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` due to the behavior of the `min` function. Therefore, the function does not handle the case of an empty list, which is a potential edge case.
