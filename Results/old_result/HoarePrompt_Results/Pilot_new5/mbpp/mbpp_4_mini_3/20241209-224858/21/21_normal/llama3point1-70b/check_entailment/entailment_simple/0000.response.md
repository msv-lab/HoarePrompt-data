Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies the smallest number in a list as required by the problem description. It uses the built-in `min()` function, which is designed to return the minimum value from an iterable, such as a list of numbers (either integers or floats). 

Hereâ€™s why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validity**: The function `func_1` takes a list `nums` as input, which is consistent with the problem description that specifies finding the smallest number in a list.
   
2. **Correct Logic**: The use of `min(nums)` correctly computes the smallest number in the provided list. The `min()` function handles both integers and floats, thus fulfilling the requirement to find the smallest number irrespective of whether the numbers are whole or fractional.

3. **Output**: The function returns the minimum value, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Therefore, the program is correct and fulfills the problem description effectively.
