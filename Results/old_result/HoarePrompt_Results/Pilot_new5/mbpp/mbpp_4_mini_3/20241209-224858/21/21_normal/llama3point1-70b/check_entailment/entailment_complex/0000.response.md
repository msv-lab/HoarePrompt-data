Correctness: **False**

The program is not correct according to the problem description because it does not handle the case where the input list `nums` is empty. The problem description states that the function must find the smallest number in a list, but the provided implementation uses the `min()` function, which raises a `ValueError` if called on an empty list. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirement to find the smallest number in all cases, particularly when the input list is empty. Since the function fails to address this scenario, it does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
