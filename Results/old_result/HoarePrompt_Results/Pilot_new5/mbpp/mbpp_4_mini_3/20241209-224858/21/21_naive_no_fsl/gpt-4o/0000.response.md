Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst)` uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list, which correctly satisfies the problem description of finding the smallest number in a list. 

The assertions provided as test cases cover various scenarios:
1. A mixed list of positive numbers, where the smallest value is clearly `1`.
2. A list with sequential numbers, where `1` is again the smallest.
3. A list of larger numbers, where `45` is the smallest.

The function correctly handles these cases. 

Additionally, considering edge cases:
- If the list is empty, calling `min()` will raise a `ValueError`, but the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list.
- If the list contains only one element, `min()` will return that element, which is correct.

Since no cases were identified where the function does not meet the problem description, the conclusion is that the code is correct.
