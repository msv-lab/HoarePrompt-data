    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list`, containing all non-list elements and elements from any lists contained within `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains an empty list.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of `nested_list`, containing all non-list elements and elements from any lists contained within `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a nested list as input and returns a flattened list containing all non-list elements from the nested structure. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. The function recursively processes any sublists found within the input list, ensuring that all elements, regardless of their depth in the nesting, are included in the output.
