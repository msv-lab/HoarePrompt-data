The `flat_list` is assigned the value of the `item`, which is appended to it. The `nested_list` contains at least one item, so `item`, being the first element of `nested_list`, is not a list. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `flat_list` was initially empty.

After executing the code, `flat_list` will now contain the first element of `nested_list`, while `nested_list` remains unchanged. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 item; `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list`; `item` is the first element of `nested_list` and is not a list.**
