Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `nested_list`, which is expected to be a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Flattening Logic**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through each element in `nested_list`. For each element:
   - If the element is a list (checked using `type(i) == list`), the function recursively calls itself (`func_1(i)`) to flatten that sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the result. This ensures that all nested lists are processed correctly.
   - If the element is not a list, it is appended directly to `flat_list`. This captures all non-list elements.

3. **Return Value**: After the loop processes all elements, the function returns `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements as well as elements from any nested lists. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` will also be empty, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

4. **Recursive Functionality**: The recursive nature of the function ensures that it can handle lists of arbitrary depth, flattening them thoroughly.

Overall, the implementation correctly follows the requirements specified in the problem description and handles various input scenarios, including empty lists and deeply nested lists. Thus, the function is robust and meets the criteria for correctness.
