Postcondition: ***`flat_list` is updated based on the type of the second element in `nested_list`. If `nested_list[1]` is a list, it extends `flat_list` with elements returned by `func_1(nested_list[1])`. If `nested_list[1]` is not a list, `flat_list` is updated to include `nested_list[1]`. In the else case, `flat_list` is a list containing the previous elements plus `i`. Additionally, `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements throughout the execution of this code.***
