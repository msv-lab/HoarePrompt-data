Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a recursive function to flatten a nested list structure. It uses recursion to check if each element of the input list is itself a list. If it is, it calls the function recursively on that sub-list. If the element is not a list, it appends the element to the `flat_list`.

This implementation will work for all potential cases of nested lists, including:
1. An empty list.
2. A list with no nested elements.
3. A list with various levels of nesting.
4. Mixed types within the nested lists.

Additionally, since the function uses `extend` to add elements from nested lists, it properly appends all elements to the `flat_list`, ensuring that all values are included in the final output.

Given that the function behaves correctly across all tested scenarios and handles all types of nested lists without errors, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
