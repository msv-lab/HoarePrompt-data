The `flat_list` is empty initially, and `i`, which is the first element of `nested_list`, is not a list. The code `flat_list.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to `flat_list`. Since `i` is not a list and it is the first element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` will now contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

Output State: **`flat_list` contains the element `i`, `nested_list` is a list that has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, and `i` is not a list.**
