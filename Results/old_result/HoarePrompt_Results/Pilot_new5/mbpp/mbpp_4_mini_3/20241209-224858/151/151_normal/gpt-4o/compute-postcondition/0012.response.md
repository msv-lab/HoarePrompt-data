In the provided code, `flat_list` is extended by the result of calling `func_1` with `item` as its argument. The value of `item` is specified to be the third item in `nested_list`, which contains at least three items.

The state of `flat_list` will be updated to include the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. The specific contents of `flat_list` after this operation will depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the value of `item`, but the existing values in `flat_list` will remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `flat_list` has been modified to include additional elements based on the result of `func_1(item)`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list, `flat_list` is adjusted based on the current value of `item` to include the elements returned by `func_1(item)`**.
