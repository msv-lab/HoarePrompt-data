To evaluate the program, let's first analyze the problem description in conjunction with the provided code.

**Problem Description:**
The function needs to flatten a nested list structure. This means taking lists within lists and producing a single list that contains all the integers in a simple, flat format.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
    return flat_list
```

**Output Hints:**
The function accepts a list called `nested_list`, containing integers and/or other nested lists. It flattens the structure recursively and returns a single list containing all integers extracted from `nested_list` and its nested lists. If `nested_list` is empty or contains no integers, the function returns an empty list.

**Analysis:**
- The function correctly identifies if an item is a list or not using `isinstance(item, list)`.
- If the item is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that item and extends `flat_list` with the returned values.
- If the item is not a list, it adds the item directly to `flat_list`.
- The function returns `flat_list`, which is expected to be a flattened version of `nested_list`.

**Edge Cases:**
1. **Empty List:** If the input is `[]`, the function will return `[]`, which is correct as per the problem description.
2. **Nested Empty Lists:** If the input is `[[], []]`, the function will also return `[]`, which is correct.
3. **List with No Integers:** If the input is `[[[]], [[]]]`, the output will still be `[]`, which aligns with expectations.
4. **Deeply Nested Lists:** The function appears to handle deeply nested structures well, as it uses recursion effectively.

The output hints align with the function's logic, confirming that the function should work as intended for the cases mentioned.

However, there is one concern regarding the function's output for cases with mixed data types (e.g., strings, floats, etc.) or if the lists contain non-integer types. The problem description doesn't explicitly limit the input to integers, yet the output hints suggest the function is focused on flattening integers only. The code does not check for the type of elements being added (it could add floats or strings as well), which might not meet the strict interpretation of "flattening a list of integers."

**Conclusion:**
Given that the problem description does not definitively restrict the input to integers, and the function does not validate or filter out non-integer values, this could lead to incorrect outputs in certain situations, even if it functions correctly under the expected input conditions (i.e., only integers).

Thus, even though the function performs the flattening as expected for the provided test cases, it does not strictly adhere to the problem description, as it does not validate the types of the elements in the input list. Therefore, it can produce outputs that may not match the expectation of flattening "integers" if other types are present.

Correctness: **False**.
