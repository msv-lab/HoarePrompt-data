Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found in `s` or appears only once. If `ch` appears more than once, it returns a modified string with all occurrences of `ch` removed, except for the first and last occurrences.**
