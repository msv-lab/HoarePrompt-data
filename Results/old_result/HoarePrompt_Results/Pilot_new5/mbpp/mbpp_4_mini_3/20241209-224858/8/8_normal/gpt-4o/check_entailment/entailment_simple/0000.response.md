Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Finding Indices**: The program uses `s.find(ch)` to locate the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`, and `s.rfind(ch)` to locate the last occurrence. These methods return the appropriate indices or `-1` if the character is not found.

2. **Handling Missing or Single Occurrences**: The check `(first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index)` handles cases where:
   - The character is not present in the string, resulting in both indices being `-1`.
   - The character occurs only once, resulting in both indices being equal.
   In these cases, the function returns the original string `s`, as required.

3. **Removing First and Last Occurrences**: If both indices are valid and different (indicating that the character occurs more than once), the function constructs a new string by concatenating:
   - The substring from the start of `s` to `first_index` (not inclusive).
   - The substring from `first_index + 1` to `last_index` (not inclusive), effectively removing the first occurrence.
   - The substring from `last_index + 1` to the end of `s`, effectively removing the last occurrence.

This approach guarantees that the first and last occurrences of the specified character are removed while preserving the order of the remaining characters in the string.

The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases, validating that it meets the problem description requirements. Thus, the program is correct.
