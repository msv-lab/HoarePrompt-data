The value of `first_index` is assigned the value of `s.find(ch)`, which returns the lowest index in the string `s` where the substring `ch` is found. If `ch` is not found in `s`, it returns -1. The values of `s` and `ch` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
