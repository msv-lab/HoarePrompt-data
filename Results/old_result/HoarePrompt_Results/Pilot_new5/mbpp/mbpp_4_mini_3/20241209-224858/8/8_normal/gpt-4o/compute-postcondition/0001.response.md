The value of `last_index` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(ch)`, which finds the highest index of the substring `ch` in `s` if it exists, or returns -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. The initial values of `s` and `ch` remain unchanged. The value of `first_index` is not directly affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
