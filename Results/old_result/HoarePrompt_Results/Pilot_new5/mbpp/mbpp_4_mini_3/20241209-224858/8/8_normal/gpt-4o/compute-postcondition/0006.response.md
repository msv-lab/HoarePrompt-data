The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string. After executing the function body, if either `first_index` is -1, `last_index` is -1, or both indices are equal, the function returns the string `s`, indicating that the character `ch` is not found in `s` or appears only once. In the other case, the function returns a new string formed by concatenating the substring from the start of `s` to `first_index`, the substring from `first_index + 1` to `last_index`, and the substring from `last_index + 1` to the end of `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `ch`, and return either the original string `s` if `ch` is not found or appears once, or a modified string with occurrences of `ch` removed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, returning `s` if `ch` is not found or appears only once in `s`, or a modified string with all occurrences of `ch` removed otherwise.**
