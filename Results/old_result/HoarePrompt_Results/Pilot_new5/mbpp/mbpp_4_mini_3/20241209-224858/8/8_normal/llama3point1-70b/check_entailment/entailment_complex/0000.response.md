The provided program is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a given string. Let's evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the annotations provided.

### Evaluation of the Program:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
    - The program correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the character using `s.find(char)` and `s.rfind(char)`.
    
2. **Single Occurrence Handling**:
    - If the character appears only once (i.e., `first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), it utilizes `s.replace(char, '', 1)` which correctly removes that sole occurrence.

3. **Multiple Occurrences Handling**:
    - If the character appears multiple times, the program constructs a new string by excluding the characters at the positions of the first and last occurrences. This is done correctly with the slicing and concatenation of the string parts.

4. **No Occurrences Handling**:
    - If the character is not present in the string (`first_occurrence == -1`), the program simply returns the original string, which is the correct behavior as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It properly handles all specified cases: removing both the first and last occurrences when there are multiple occurrences, removing the only occurrence when there is one, and returning the original string when the character does not exist.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
