To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the function and its intended behavior.

## Problem Description:
The function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

## Program:
```python
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

## Analysis:
1. **Finding Indices**: The function uses `find` to get the first occurrence and `rfind` to get the last occurrence of the character `ch`. This part is correct.
2. **Edge Cases**: The condition `if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:` checks for three scenarios:
   - If the character does not exist in the string, it returns the original string.
   - If the character only occurs once, it also returns the original string.
3. **Removing Characters**: The way the function constructs the new string by concatenating segments is appropriate, as it excludes the characters at the identified indices.

## Potential Issues:
Let's consider some edge cases that might not be handled correctly:
- If the character is at the beginning and end of the string, for example, `func_1('aaaa', 'a')`. This should return an empty string, but the logic will return `s` itself, which is incorrect.
- If the string is empty or consists of the character repeated, such as `func_1('', 'a')` or `func_1('bbbb', 'b')`, which should return an empty string.

### Test Cases:
- `func_1('aaaa', 'a')` should return `''` but would incorrectly return `'aaaa'`.
- `func_1('', 'a')` should return `''` and correctly does so, but it doesn't address the repeated character case.

Given the above analysis, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case where the target character is the only character present in the string or when it is repeated.
