To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description and output hints, I will first analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Description:
The task is to create a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string. 

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The program correctly finds the first and last occurrences of `char` using `find` and `rfind`. 
2. **Removing Characters**:
   - If `char` appears exactly once (`first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), it replaces that occurrence with an empty string using `replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If `char` appears multiple times, it constructs a new string by slicing and concatenating the parts of the original string, effectively removing both occurrences.
3. **No Occurrence**: If `char` does not exist in the string, it returns the original string.

### Edge Cases:
- **String with one character**: If `s` is a single character equal to `char`, it should return an empty string.
- **String with no occurrences of `char`**: It should return the original string.
- **Multiple occurrences of `char` in different positions**: It should correctly remove the first and last occurrences.
- **String where the first and last occurrence are the same**: It should correctly remove that single occurrence.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function:
- Removes the single occurrence if `char` appears exactly once.
- Removes both the first and last occurrences if `char` appears multiple times.
- Returns the original string if `char` does not exist in `s`.

The hints do align with the functionality of the code, as they summarize the behavior accurately and do not introduce any contradictions.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the logic and considering edge cases, I can confirm that:
1. The code adheres to the problem description across all provided cases.
2. The output hints agree with the code's functionality and do not highlight any missing edge cases.

Thus, I conclude that the program correctly implements the required functionality based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
