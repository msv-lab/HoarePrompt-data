The provided code defines a function `func_1` that converts degrees to radians using the formula `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. 

Initially assessing the code against the problem description, it appears to fulfill the requirement of converting degrees to radians correctly. The mathematical conversion is accurate, and the assertions provided test the function against known values, confirming its correctness for those specific inputs.

However, considering edge cases that the function might not handle, we note the output hints state that there are no checks for input types. This suggests that if a non-numeric value (e.g., a string or `None`) is passed to the function, it could raise a `TypeError`. This is a significant oversight because the function should ideally handle or raise a meaningful error for such cases, in line with robust programming practices.

Now, looking at the output hints, they generally align with the function's intent and operations. Indeed, the hints correctly mention the lack of input type checks, which points out a potential failure case when handling non-numeric input.

Given that the function does not follow the problem description for all potential cases, specifically regarding input validation, we conclude that the implementation is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle non-numeric input values, which could lead to runtime errors and does not fulfill the requirement of being robust against all potential inputs.
