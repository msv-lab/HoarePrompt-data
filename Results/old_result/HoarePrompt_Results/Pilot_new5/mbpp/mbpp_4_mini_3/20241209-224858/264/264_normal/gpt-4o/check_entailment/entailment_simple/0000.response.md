Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to convert degrees to radians. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(degrees)` is defined to take a numeric value `degrees` as its parameter, which represents an angle in degrees. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Conversion Formula**: The function uses the formula for converting degrees to radians, which is: 
   \[
   \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)
   \]
   This formula is correctly implemented in the return statement of the function.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the program test the function with specific degree values (90, 60, and 120) and check that the returned values match the expected radian values:
   - \(90\) degrees converts to \(1.5707963267948966\) radians.
   - \(60\) degrees converts to \(1.0471975511965976\) radians.
   - \(120\) degrees converts to \(2.0943951023931953\) radians.
   The expected outputs are indeed the correct conversions, confirming the accuracy of the implementation.

Since all elements of the program align properly with the problem description's requirements, the conclusion is that the function will always perform the required conversion accurately for any numeric input representing degrees.
