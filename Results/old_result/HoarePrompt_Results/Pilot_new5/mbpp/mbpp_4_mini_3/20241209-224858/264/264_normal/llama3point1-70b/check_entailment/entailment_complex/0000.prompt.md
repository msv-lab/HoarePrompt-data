You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns the value of deg multiplied by π (pi) divided by 180, which converts the angle from degrees to radians.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns the equivalent angle in radians by converting it using the formula `deg * π / 180`. It does not handle non-numeric input or provide any error checking for invalid values, assuming `deg` will always be a numeric type.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
