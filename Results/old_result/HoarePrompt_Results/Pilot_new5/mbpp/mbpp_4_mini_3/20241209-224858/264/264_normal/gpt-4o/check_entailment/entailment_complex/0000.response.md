Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to convert degrees to radians. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a numeric value representing an angle in degrees as input and correctly calculates the equivalent value in radians using the formula `radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. This is the accurate formula for converting degrees to radians.

2. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the program test the function with known values (90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees) and check if the output matches the expected results, which are the correct radian values for those degrees. All assertions are true, confirming that the function works as intended for these specific cases.

3. **General Case**: The mathematical conversion is general and applies to any numeric input representing degrees. Therefore, as long as the input is a number, the function will convert it to radians correctly.

4. **No Explicit Error Handling**: While it is noted that there are no checks for input types, the problem description does not explicitly require such checks. The function will raise a `TypeError` if a non-numeric value is passed, which is standard behavior in Python. However, this does not negate the correctness of the conversion for valid numeric inputs.

In conclusion, the function meets the requirements set out in the problem description, and thus the correctness is deemed true.
