Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ) as specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Calculation of r**: The program calculates the radius \( r \) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is correct for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

2. **Calculation of θ**: The angle \( θ \) is calculated using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which correctly computes the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y). This handles all quadrants correctly and avoids issues with division by zero.

3. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple containing \( r \) and \( θ \), which aligns with the expected output format of polar coordinates.

4. **Assertions for Testing**: The assertions provided in the program test specific cases of (x, y) to validate that the function produces the correct results for those inputs, confirming that the implementation is correct.

Overall, the program consistently follows the problem description and accurately converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
