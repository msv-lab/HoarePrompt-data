Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, as specified in the problem description. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Rectangular Coordinates**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point in 2D space.

2. **Polar Coordinates**: The function computes two values corresponding to polar coordinates:
   - `r`: This is calculated using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which gives the distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`. This is indeed the radius in polar coordinates.
   - `phi`: This is computed using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle (in radians) between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`. This is the angular coordinate in polar coordinates.

3. **Return Values**: The function returns both `r` and `phi`, which are the correct polar coordinates for the input rectangular coordinates.

Since the program correctly implements the conversion as described, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
