The variable `theta` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`. The function `math.atan2(y, x)` computes the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y) in the plane, returning a value based on the signs of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates; `r` is math.sqrt(x); `theta` is the angle in radians calculated as `math.atan2(y, x)`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates; `r` is math.sqrt(x); `theta` is math.atan2(y, x)**.
