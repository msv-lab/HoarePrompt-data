`r` is assigned the value of `math.hypot(x, y)`, which calculates the Euclidean distance from the origin (0, 0) to the point (x, y). Since `x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing coordinates, `r` will be a floating-point number that is the result of the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a floating-point number representing a rectangular coordinate, `y` is a floating-point number representing a rectangular coordinate, `r` is a floating-point number equal to `math.hypot(x, y)`.**
