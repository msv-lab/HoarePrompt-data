Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) into polar coordinates (r, θ). The function `func_1(x, y)` calculates:

1. `r` (the radius) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which correctly computes the distance from the origin to the point (x, y).
2. `θ` (the angle) using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (x, y). This function correctly handles all quadrants since it takes into account the signs of both x and y.

The assertions provided in the code test the function against specific cases, and they confirm that the function behaves as expected for those inputs. The implementation correctly handles various input scenarios, including positive and negative values for x and y, as well as the origin (0, 0).

I couldn't find any input cases where the function does not behave as expected according to the problem description. Thus, the function meets the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases.
