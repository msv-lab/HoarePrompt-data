The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, it calculates two values: `r`, which is equal to the hypotenuse of the coordinates (x, y), and `phi`, which is the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers `x` and `y`, and return their hypotenuse `r` and the angle `phi` in radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, which are floating-point numbers representing coordinates, and returns r as the hypotenuse and phi as the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y).**
