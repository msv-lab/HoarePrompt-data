The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, it returns the polar coordinates `(r, theta)`, where `r` is the square root of `x` and `theta` is the angle obtained from the arctangent of `y` divided by `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept real numbers `x` and `y` representing rectangular coordinates and return their corresponding polar coordinates `(r, theta)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, which are real numbers, and returns the polar coordinates (r, theta) where r is the square root of x and theta is the angle obtained from the arctangent of y divided by x.**
