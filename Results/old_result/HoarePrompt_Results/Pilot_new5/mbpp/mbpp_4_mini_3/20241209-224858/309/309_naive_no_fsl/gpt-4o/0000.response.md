Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly handle the edge case of an empty string. According to the problem description, we need to determine whether all characters in the input string are the same. The function currently returns `True` when the input string is empty (`s` is falsy), which is incorrect. 

An empty string does not have any characters, so it is not accurate to say that all characters are the same when there are no characters at all. In this case, it should return `False` instead of `True`.

For example:
- Calling `func_1('')` would incorrectly return `True`, but according to the problem statement, it should return `False`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails to handle the case of an empty string properly.
