To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the specified problem description, let's analyze the problem and the code.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to write a Python function to check whether all the characters in a given string are the same.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1('python') == False
assert func_1('aaa') == True
assert func_1('data') == False

def func_1(s):
    if not s:
        return True
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
    return True
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1(s)` begins by checking if the string `s` is empty. If it is empty, it returns `True`. This is a design choice that may not align with the typical interpretation of whether all characters in a string are the same, as an empty string could be considered to have no characters at all (or, more commonly, "not all characters are the same").
2. The function then stores the first character of the string in `first_char` and iterates through each character in the string `s`. If it finds any character that is not the same as `first_char`, it returns `False`.
3. If it completes the loop without finding differing characters, it returns `True`.

**Potential Case:**
- An edge case is the empty string `''`. According to the function, it will return `True`, which may not be a correct interpretation of the problem as stated.
- Additionally, thereâ€™s no explicit handling for strings with a single character, e.g., `func_1('a')`, which should return `True` but is not tested in the assertions.

Given that the problem's description does not clarify the treatment of empty strings and the assumption that `True` for an empty string may not be universally accepted, we have identified a case where the program's behavior is debatable.

**Conclusion:** 
The function does not handle the edge case of the empty string in a manner that aligns with most interpretations of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.
