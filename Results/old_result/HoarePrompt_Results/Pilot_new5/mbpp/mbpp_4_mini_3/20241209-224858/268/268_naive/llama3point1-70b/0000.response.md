To evaluate the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that, given a matrix represented as a list of lists, returns the maximum value from the nth column of that matrix.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program does not handle cases where:
   - The matrix is empty (i.e., `matrix = []`).
   - The column index `n` is less than 1, which would lead to an index error when trying to access `row[n - 1]`.
   - The column index `n` is greater than the number of columns in any row of the matrix.

2. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `matrix` is empty, calling `max()` will raise a `ValueError` because there are no items to consider.
   - If `n` is 0 or negative, it will attempt to access an invalid index, causing an `IndexError`.
   - If `n` exceeds the number of columns in the matrix, it will also raise an `IndexError`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for these scenarios, which are critical for ensuring correctness. Therefore, the function will break or produce incorrect results for inputs that fall into these categories.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle edge cases such as an empty matrix, invalid column indices, and out-of-bounds accesses, leading to potential runtime errors.
