The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix` and `n`. The parameter `matrix` is a list of lists (2D list) where each inner list has the same number of elements, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n < \text{len(matrix[0])}\). After executing the function body, it returns the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix, where the nth column contains the nth elements from each row of the matrix. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2D list `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter matrix (a 2D list) and a non-negative integer n, returns the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix.**
