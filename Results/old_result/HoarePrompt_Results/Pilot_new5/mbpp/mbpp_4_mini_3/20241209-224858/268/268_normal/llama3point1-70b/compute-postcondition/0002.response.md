The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix`, which is a 2D list of numbers, and `n`, a non-negative integer. It retrieves the maximum value from the nth column of the `matrix`. However, it is important to note that if `n` is 0, it will return the maximum value from the first column, and if `n` is greater than the number of columns (i.e., `n >= len(matrix[0])`), it might raise an `IndexError` due to accessing an invalid index. The function assumes that `matrix` is not empty and that `n` is always within the valid range as specified in the comments, but those assumptions might not hold depending on the external context. Thus, the functionality also needs to consider potential edge cases involving the validity of `n`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` of numbers and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix, assuming `n` is valid and within the range of the matrix's columns. If `n` is out of bounds, it may raise an `IndexError`. **
