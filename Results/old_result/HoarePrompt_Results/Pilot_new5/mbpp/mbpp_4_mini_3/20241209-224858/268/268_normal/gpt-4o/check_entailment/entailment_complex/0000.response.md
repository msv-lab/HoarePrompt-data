Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for scenarios where the input matrix might be empty or when the specified column index `n` does not exist due to an invalid value (e.g., `n` being greater than or equal to the number of columns). 

In the case of an empty matrix or an invalid column index, the program will raise an `IndexError`, which is not addressed. Therefore, the implementation does not guarantee correct behavior for all possible inputs as required by the problem description. 

To make the program correct, it should include checks to validate that the matrix is not empty and that `n` is within the bounds of the matrix's columns before attempting to access the nth column.
