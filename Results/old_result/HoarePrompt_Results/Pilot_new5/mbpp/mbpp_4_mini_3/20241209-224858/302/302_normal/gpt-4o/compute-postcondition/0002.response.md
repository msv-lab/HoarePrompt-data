According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`. Since `len(arr)` represents the number of elements in the array `arr`, if `arr` is not empty, then `high` will be at least 0, which means that `low` (0) will be less than or equal to `high`. 

Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute is already satisfied as long as `arr` is not an empty list. If `arr` is empty, then `len(arr)` would be 0, making `high` equal to -1, which would mean `low` (0) is not less than or equal to `high` (-1) and the loop will not execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one time, `arr` must contain at least one element.

State: **`arr` must not be empty**
