The provided Python function aims to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Let's analyze the code against the problem description:

### Problem Description Analysis
- The function should return the index of the first occurrence of a specified number `num` in the sorted array `arr`.
- If `num` is not present, the function should return -1.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1
```
- The function uses a linear search by iterating through the elements of the array `arr`.
- When it finds an element that matches `num`, it immediately returns the index `i`.
- If the loop completes without finding `num`, it returns -1.

### Edge Case Consideration
- The function correctly returns -1 for an empty array or when `num` is not in `arr`.
- However, the function performs a linear search and does not leverage the fact that `arr` is sorted. For large arrays, this could be inefficient. 

### Output Hints Analysis
- The output hints indicate that the function indeed returns the index of `num` if it is found in `arr`, or -1 if it is not. 
- They point out the inefficiency due to the linear search, which is a valid observation but does not affect the correctness of the function regarding the problem description.

### Conclusion
Despite the inefficiency of the linear search approach, the function correctly identifies the first occurrence of `num` in the sorted array `arr` and adheres to the problem requirements. Therefore, it fulfills the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

This is because the function performs correctly according to the problem description, returning the index of the first occurrence of the number or -1 when the number is not present in the array.
