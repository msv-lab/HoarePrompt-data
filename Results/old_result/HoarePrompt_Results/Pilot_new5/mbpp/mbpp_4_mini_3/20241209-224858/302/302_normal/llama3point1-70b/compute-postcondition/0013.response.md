Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of sorted integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It returns the index of `num` in `arr` if found; otherwise, it returns -1. The function performs a linear search, which does not take advantage of the sorted property of `arr`, meaning it may not be efficient for large lists.**
