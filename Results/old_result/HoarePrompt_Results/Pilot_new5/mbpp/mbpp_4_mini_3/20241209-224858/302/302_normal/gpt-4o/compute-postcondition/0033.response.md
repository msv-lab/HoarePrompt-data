Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` is found, it returns the index of its first occurrence; if `target` is not present, it returns -1. The function assumes that the input list `arr` is sorted and may be empty. If `arr` is empty, it will return -1 since there are no elements to search. **
