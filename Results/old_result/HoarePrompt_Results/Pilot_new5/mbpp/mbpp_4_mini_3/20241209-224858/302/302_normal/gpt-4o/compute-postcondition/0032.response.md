The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. The parameter `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `target` is an integer. After executing the function body, if `target` is found in the sorted list `arr`, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `target`. If `target` is not present in `arr`, the function returns -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returning the index of the first occurrence of `target` if found, or -1 if `target` is not present in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` if found, or -1 if `target` is not present in `arr`.**
