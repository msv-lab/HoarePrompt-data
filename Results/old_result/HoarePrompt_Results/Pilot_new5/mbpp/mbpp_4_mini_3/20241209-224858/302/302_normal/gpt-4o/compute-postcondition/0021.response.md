Postcondition: ***`arr` is not empty; if `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, then `result` is equal to `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to be greater than `mid`, with `high` unchanged and `mid` recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is not less than `target`, then `low` remains less than or equal to `high`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`.***
