The value of `mid` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, the value of `mid` will be equal to either the average of `low` and `high` rounded down or to one of those values depending on their specific values. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is not empty; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is the floor division of `(low + high) // 2`.**
