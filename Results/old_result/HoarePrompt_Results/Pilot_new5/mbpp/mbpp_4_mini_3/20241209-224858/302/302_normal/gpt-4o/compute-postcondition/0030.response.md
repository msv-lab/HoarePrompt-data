Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, indicating that the search has concluded; if the `target` was found in the original `arr`, then `result` is set to the index of the first occurrence of `target`. If the `target` is not present, `result` remains -1. The original `arr` must have been sorted and not empty for the loop to execute.**
