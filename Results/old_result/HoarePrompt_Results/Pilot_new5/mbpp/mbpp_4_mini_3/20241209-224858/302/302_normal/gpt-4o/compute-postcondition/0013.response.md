Postcondition: ***`arr` must not be empty; if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1.***
