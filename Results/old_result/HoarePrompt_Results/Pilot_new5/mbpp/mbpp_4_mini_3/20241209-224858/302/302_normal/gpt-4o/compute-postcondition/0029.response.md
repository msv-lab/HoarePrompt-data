Postcondition: ***`arr` is not empty; if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` is equal to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` while `high` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `low` remains less than or equal to `high`. The value of `mid` is recalculated as the floor division of `(low + high) // 2`.***
