According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop can execute again as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `arr` is not empty, but we don't know the exact values of `low` and `high`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Given that the condition is `low <= high`, if `low` is currently equal to `high`, then `low` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `high` in order to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is not empty; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
