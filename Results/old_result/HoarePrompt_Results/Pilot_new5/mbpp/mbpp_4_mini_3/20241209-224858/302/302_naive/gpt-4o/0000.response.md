To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

The problem description states: "Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array."

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

The program uses binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the sorted array `arr`. The key logic in this program includes:

- It initializes `low` and `high` to the bounds of the array.
- It tracks the `result` index whenever it finds the target.
- When it finds the `target`, it continues searching in the left half of the array to ensure it finds the first occurrence by updating `high`.

Now, let's examine if there are any cases where the program might not work correctly:

1. **Case with target not in array**: If the target is not present in the array, the function should return `-1`. This behavior is correctly implemented since `result` would remain `-1` if the target is not found.

2. **Case with multiple occurrences**: The logic for updating `high` to `mid - 1` when the target is found ensures that it will continue to search for an earlier occurrence. This is correctly implemented.

3. **Case with first element as target**: If the first element in the array is the target, the function will return `0`, which is correct.

4. **Case with last element as target**: If the last element of the array is the target and it's the only occurrence, the function will also correctly return the index.

5. **Edge case of an empty array**: If the array is empty, the function should return `-1`, which is correctly handled since `high` would be `-1`, and `low` would start at `0`, thus the while loop would not execute.

Given these considerations, I cannot identify any cases where the program fails to meet the problem description or does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
