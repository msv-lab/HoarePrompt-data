Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number (`target`) in a sorted array (`arr`). Here's a breakdown of how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Sorted Array Requirement**: The function assumes that the input list `arr` is sorted, which is a prerequisite stated in the problem description.

2. **Finding the First Occurrence**: The algorithm utilizes a binary search approach to find not just any occurrence of `target`, but specifically the first occurrence. When `arr[mid]` equals `target`, instead of returning immediately, it updates `result` and continues searching in the left half of the array (by setting `high` to `mid - 1`). This ensures that the function will find the first occurrence of `target`.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the index of the first occurrence if `target` is found. If the `target` is not present in `arr`, it correctly returns -1. This matches the requirement of returning the index of the first occurrence or indicating its absence.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where `arr` is empty by returning -1. This behavior is consistent with the description that if `arr` is empty, there's no target to find.

Given all these points, the function meets the specifications laid out in the problem description and behaves correctly for all potential cases.
