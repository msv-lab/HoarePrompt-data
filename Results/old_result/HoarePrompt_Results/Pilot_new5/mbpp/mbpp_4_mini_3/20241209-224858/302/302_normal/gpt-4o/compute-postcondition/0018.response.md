The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` must not be empty; `low` is now `mid + 1` (which is greater than the previous `low`); `high` remains unchanged; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` (before the update).**
