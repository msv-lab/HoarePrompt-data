The variable `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is defined as the floor division of `(low + high) // 2`, this means `low` will be increased by 1 from its previous value. The other variables `arr`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is not empty; `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is the floor division of `(low + high) // 2`.**
