According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will represent the index of the last element and `x` will hold the last element of the list. For the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 integer, and at the start of the loop, `i` will be 0 and `x` will be the first integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first integer in the list**
