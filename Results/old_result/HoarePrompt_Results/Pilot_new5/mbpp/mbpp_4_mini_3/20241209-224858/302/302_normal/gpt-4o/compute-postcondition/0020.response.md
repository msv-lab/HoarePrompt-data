Postcondition: ***`arr` is not empty, `low` is greater than `mid` if `arr[mid] < target`, with `high` unchanged and `mid` recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is not less than `target`, then `low` remains less than or equal to `high`, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, while `mid` is still recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`.***
