Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the tuple is empty correctly. According to the problem description, if the tuple has no elements, it is ambiguous whether to consider it as having the same data type or not. However, the program returns `True` for an empty tuple. 

An edge case to consider:
- For an empty tuple `()`, the output should be defined. The current implementation returns `True`, but it could be argued that an empty tuple does not have a consistent data type among its elements because there are none. This inconsistency with the problem description makes the program incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
