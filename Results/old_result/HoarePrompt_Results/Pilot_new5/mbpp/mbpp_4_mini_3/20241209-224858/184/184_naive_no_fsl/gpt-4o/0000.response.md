Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` and returns a new list containing only those numbers that are odd (i.e., those for which `num % 2 != 0` evaluates to True).

The assertions demonstrate that the function correctly filters out even numbers and retains odd numbers for the given test cases. 

To further validate the correctness of the implementation, consider additional edge cases:
1. An empty list: `func_1([])` should return `[]` (correctly handled).
2. A list with all even numbers: `func_1([2, 4, 6, 8])` should return `[]` (correctly handled).
3. A list with all odd numbers: `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7])` should return `[1, 3, 5, 7]` (correctly handled).
4. A list with negative numbers: `func_1([-1, -2, -3, -4])` should return `[-1, -3]` (correctly handled).

Since all potential cases are handled correctly and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description, the implementation is correct.
