The function `func_1` is designed to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that are odd (`num % 2 != 0`). 

From the problem description, we can conclude that the function is supposed to:
- Take a list of integers as input.
- Return a new list that contains only the odd integers.
- Return an empty list if the input list is empty or if there are no odd integers.

Now, let's analyze the code:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
```
This implementation appears correct in its logic. It will return an empty list for both an empty input list and an input list that contains no odd integers because the list comprehension will yield no values in those cases. 

Next, let's consider the output hints:
- The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing only odd integers from the original list.
- It also states that if `nums` is empty or contains no odd integers, the function will return an empty list.

The output hints align with the logic and behavior of the function. They correctly describe that the function will produce an empty list when appropriate.

To ensure correctness against various test cases:
- For the input `[]` (empty list), the output will be `[]`, as expected.
- For input `[1, 2, 3]`, it will return `[1, 3]`, which is correct.
- For input `[2, 4, 6]`, it will return `[]`, which is also correct.

Since the implementation adheres to the problem description for all potential cases and aligns with the output hints, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly filters odd numbers from a list and handles edge cases like empty lists and lists without odd numbers as described.
