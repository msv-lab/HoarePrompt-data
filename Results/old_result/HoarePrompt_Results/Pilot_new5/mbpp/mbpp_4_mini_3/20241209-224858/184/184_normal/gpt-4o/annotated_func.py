#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of all integers from the list 'nums' that are odd (num % 2 != 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. If `nums` is empty or contains no odd integers, the function will return an empty list.
