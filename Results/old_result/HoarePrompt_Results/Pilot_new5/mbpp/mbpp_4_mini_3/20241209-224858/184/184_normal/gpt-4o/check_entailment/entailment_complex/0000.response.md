Correctness: **True**

The provided program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to filter out odd numbers from a list of integers. Here's how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a single argument `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` iterates over each number in the input list `nums`. The condition `num % 2 != 0` correctly identifies odd numbers, as it checks if the number is not evenly divisible by 2.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. If the input list is empty or contains no odd integers, the result will naturally be an empty list, which is consistent with the problem description's requirements.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided are examples of expected behavior:
   - The first assertion checks a list with a mix of odd and even numbers and confirms that only the odd numbers `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` are returned.
   - The second assertion tests another mixed list and verifies it returns the correct odd numbers `[45, 67, 93]`.
   - The third assertion again confirms that the function correctly returns all odd numbers `[5, 7, 9, 3]` from the list.

Since the function correctly identifies and returns odd numbers from the list in all tested scenarios and handles edge cases (like returning an empty list when there are no odd numbers), it meets the criteria set forth in the problem description.

Thus, the program operates correctly as specified.
