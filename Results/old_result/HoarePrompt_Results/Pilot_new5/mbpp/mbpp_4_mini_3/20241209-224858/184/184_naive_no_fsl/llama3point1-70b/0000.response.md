Correctness: **False**

The provided program filters odd numbers from the input list `nums`. However, it does not account for cases where the input list may be empty or contain only even numbers. For example:

1. If the input is an empty list `[]`, the expected output should also be an empty list `[]`, which the program handles correctly.
2. If the input is a list of even numbers, such as `[2, 4, 6]`, the expected output is also an empty list `[]`, which the program handles correctly.
3. However, if the input is a list containing both odd and even numbers, such as `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output will be `[1, 3]`, which is correct as it filters odd numbers.

The program appears to work for all edge cases, including empty lists and lists with only even numbers. However, since the problem description only explicitly mentions "filtering odd numbers," it could be interpreted to mean that only odd numbers should be retained. If the input contains any non-integer types, such as `[1, 2, "three"]`, the program will raise a `TypeError` due to the modulus operation not being applicable to strings.

Therefore, since the program fails to handle non-integer types, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
