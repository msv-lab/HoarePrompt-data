You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True
assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False
assert func_1('  lang  .') == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of characters where the first and last characters can be any character except 'z', and the string can be of any length.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True because the string 's' contains at least one 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string of characters where the first and last characters can be any character except 'z', the string can be of any length, and there is no 'z' between the first and last characters of `s`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. It returns True if at least one 'z' is found within that substring; otherwise, it returns False. If the string has a length of 2 or less, the substring is empty, and the function will return False since there cannot be any 'z' in an empty substring.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
