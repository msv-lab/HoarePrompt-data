The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string with a length of at least 1. After executing the function body, the function evaluates several conditions based on the string `s` and its first word `word`. 

- In Case_1, if `word` has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' within its substring (excluding the first and last characters), the function returns `True`.
- In Case_2, the function returns `True`, indicating a successful evaluation based on the conditions provided.
- In Case_3, the function returns `True`.
- In Case_4, the function returns `False`, indicating that none of the words in the list had 'z' present in the substring from index 1 to the second to last index and that the string `s` has a length of at least 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s`, and based on various conditions related to the first word in `s`, it returns `True` or `False` accordingly. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is a string with a length of at least 1, and returns True under certain conditions regarding the first word of s, or False if those conditions are not met.**
