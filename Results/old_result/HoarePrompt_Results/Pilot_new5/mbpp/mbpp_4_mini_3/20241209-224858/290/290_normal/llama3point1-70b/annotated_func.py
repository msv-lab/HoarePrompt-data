#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string with a length of at least 1.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string with a length of at least 1, `words` is a list of words derived from `s`, `word` is the last checked word in the list, and none of the words had length greater than 1 with 'z' present in the substring from index 1 to the second to last index.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that none of the words in the list had 'z' present in the substring from index 1 to the second to last index and that the string 's' has a length of at least 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` with a length of at least 1 and returns True if any word in `s` (after being split into words) has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in its substring, excluding the first and last characters. If no such word exists, it returns False. The function does not check for special cases like strings without spaces or single-character words explicitly, but it inherently handles them by its logic.
