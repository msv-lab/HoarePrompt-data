The function accepts a string `s` with a length of at least 1 and returns True if any word in `s` (after being split into words) has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in its substring, excluding the first and last characters. If no such word exists, it returns False. The function does not check for special cases like strings without spaces or single-character words explicitly, but it inherently handles them by its logic.
