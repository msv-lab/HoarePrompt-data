#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list where each sublist consists of elements from 'lst' taken at intervals of 'n', creating 'n' separate groups based on the position of elements in the original list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` taken at every `n`th position starting from indices `0` to `n-1`. This effectively divides the original list into `n` groups based on the intervals of `n`. There are no error checks for when `n` is out of bounds or when `lst` is empty, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
