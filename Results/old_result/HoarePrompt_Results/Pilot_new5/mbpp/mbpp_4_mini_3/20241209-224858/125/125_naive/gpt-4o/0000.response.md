To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it accurately fulfills the requirement of splitting a list for every nth element.

### Problem description:
The requirement is to take a list and an integer n and split the list such that every nth element forms a sub-list, returning a list of these resulting lists.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

### Analysis:
1. The function starts by initializing `result` as a list of empty lists, with `n` sublists.
2. It then enumerates over the input list `lst`, assigning each element `element` to a sublist based on the index `i` modulo `n`.
3. This means that the first element goes to the first sublist, the second element goes to the second sublist, and so on, with the cycle repeating every `n` elements.

### Test Cases:
The assertions provided test the function under various scenarios, and they all return the expected output. However, we need to check for cases that might not have been covered by the provided test cases.

1. **Edge Case - When `lst` is empty:**
   If `lst` is empty (e.g., `func_1([], 3)`), the expected output should be `[[], [], []]`, an array of `n` empty sublists. The current implementation would return this correctly.
   
2. **Edge Case - When `n` is greater than the length of `lst`:**
   For example, `func_1([1, 2], 5)` should return `[[1], [2], [], [], []]`. The function handles this scenario as expected by placing the first two elements in the appropriate sublists and leaving the rest empty.

3. **Edge Case - When `n` is equal to 1:**
   With `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)`, the expected output is `[[1, 2, 3]]`. The program again correctly accumulates all elements into a single list.

4. **Edge Case - When `n` is 0:**
   The input `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` would result in a division by zero error. There is no check in the code to handle this scenario, which could lead to a runtime error.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the edge case where `n` is zero, which is a potential case that can cause an error. Therefore, since it does not correctly handle every possible input as specified in the problem description, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
