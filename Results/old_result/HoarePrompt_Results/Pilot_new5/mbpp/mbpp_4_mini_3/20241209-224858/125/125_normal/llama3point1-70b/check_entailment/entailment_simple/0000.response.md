Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality specified in the problem description. According to the problem, the function should split the list into sublists for every nth element, returning a list of those resulting sublists. However, the implementation creates 'n' sublists, where each sublist contains elements starting from index `i` and taking every nth element thereafter (i.e., `lst[i::n]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`).

This means that if the input list has elements at non-uniform intervals (which can occur if `n` is not equal to the length of the list), the output will not reflect the intended splitting of the list every `n` elements. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n` is `2`, the expected output should be `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`, but the actual output would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`, which does not match the requirement of splitting the list every `n` elements.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirement to split the list into sublists based on each nth element.
