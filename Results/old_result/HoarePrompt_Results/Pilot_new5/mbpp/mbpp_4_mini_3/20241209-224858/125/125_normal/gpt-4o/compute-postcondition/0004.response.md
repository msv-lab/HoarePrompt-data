In the provided code snippet, `result[i % n].append(element)` modifies the `result` list by appending `element` to the sublist at the index `i % n`. With `i` being `1`, the calculation of `i % n` determines which sublist to target in `result`. Since `n` is a positive integer with a minimum value of `2`, `i % n` will yield `1` (as `1 % n` equals `1` for any `n` greater than `1`).

The initial state indicates that `result` contains `n` sublists, where the first sublist already has `element` appended. No other variables (`lst`, `n`, `element`, and `i`) are directly altered by this operation. Therefore, the state of `result` will reflect the addition of `element` to the second sublist (index `1`).

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer such that n must be at least 2 and n <= len(lst), `result` now contains `n` sublists with the first sublist having `element` appended, `element` is the second element of `lst`, and `result[1]` now has `element` appended; `i` is 1.**
