Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

**Problem description**: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

**Analysis**:
1. The function first merges the two lists and sorts them, which is correct for finding the median. However, it assumes that the input lists are sorted, which is a requirement of the problem description but not enforced in the implementation.
   
2. The calculation of `middle_index` is done with `size - 1`, which seems incorrect. For a list of even size, the median should be calculated from the elements at the indices `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`, not `size - 1` and `size`.

3. The program does not properly handle the case when `size` is odd since the condition is incorrectly calculating the median.

4. The `size` parameter should represent the actual size of the input lists, but if it were to be incorrect, the computation would also yield wrong results.

**Counterexample**:
For instance, if we have:
- `list1 = [1, 3]`
- `list2 = [2, 4]`
- `size = 2` (which indicates both lists have 2 elements)

Expected median would be:
- Merged list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Median: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

The current implementation will compute the median as:
- `middle_index = 2 - 1 = 1`
- It will incorrectly return `3` because it mistakenly uses `merged_list[1]` and `merged_list[2]`.

Thus, there are cases where the function does not fulfill the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
