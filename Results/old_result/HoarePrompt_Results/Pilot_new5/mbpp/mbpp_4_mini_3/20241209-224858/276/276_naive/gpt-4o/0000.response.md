To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the program logic and check if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Description:
The function should compute the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Program:
```python
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median
```

### Analysis:
1. **Merging the Lists**: The function correctly merges the two sorted lists into one and sorts it. This is crucial for finding the median, especially when both lists are already sorted.

2. **Finding the Median**:
   - It correctly calculates the middle index (`mid`).
   - For an even total number of elements, it correctly computes the median as the average of the two middle elements.
   - For an odd total number of elements, it takes the middle element as the median.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **All elements are the same**: `func_1([1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], 3)` should return `1.0`.
- **Negative numbers**: `func_1([-3, -1, 0], [-2, 1, 4], 3)` should return `-1.0`.
- **Large numbers**: `func_1([1000000, 2000000, 3000000], [4000000, 5000000, 6000000], 3)` should return `3500000.0`.

### Conclusion:
The program successfully calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size and handles various cases (including even and odd lengths of merged lists). Since I was unable to find any specific cases where the program fails to meet the problem description requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
