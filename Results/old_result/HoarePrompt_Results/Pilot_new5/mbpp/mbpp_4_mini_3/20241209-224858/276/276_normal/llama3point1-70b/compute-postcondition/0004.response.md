Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are two lists of integers that are sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer such that size > 0 and size is equal to the lengths of both `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. The size is an odd integer.***
