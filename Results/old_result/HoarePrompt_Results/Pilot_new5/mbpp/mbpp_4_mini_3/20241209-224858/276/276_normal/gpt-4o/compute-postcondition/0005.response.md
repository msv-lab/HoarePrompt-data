The variable `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[mid]`, where `mid` is equal to `len(merged_list) // 2`. Since the length of `merged_list` is odd, `mid` will point to the exact middle element of `merged_list`. Therefore, `median` is the middle integer of the combined and sorted integers from `list1` and `list2`. The states of `list1`, `list2`, and `merged_list` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of size `n`; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all integers from `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `len(merged_list) // 2`; the length of `merged_list` is odd; `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]`.**
