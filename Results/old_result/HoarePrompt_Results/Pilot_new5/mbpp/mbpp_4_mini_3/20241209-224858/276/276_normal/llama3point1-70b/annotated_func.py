#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are two lists of integers that are sorted in non-decreasing order, and size is a positive integer such that size > 0 and size is equal to the lengths of both list1 and list2.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are two lists of integers that are sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the lengths of both lists, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the `median` is equal to `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`. Otherwise, the `median` is the element at index `size - 1` of `merged_list`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, which is determined based on the value of `size` and the contents of `merged_list`. If `size` is even, it is the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it is the middle element of `merged_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with a positive integer `size` that represents the lengths of both lists. It merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and returns the median. If `size` is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element. However, it assumes `size` is equal to the length of the original lists and does not handle cases where the lists might be empty or `size` does not match the actual lengths of the lists, which could lead to index errors.
