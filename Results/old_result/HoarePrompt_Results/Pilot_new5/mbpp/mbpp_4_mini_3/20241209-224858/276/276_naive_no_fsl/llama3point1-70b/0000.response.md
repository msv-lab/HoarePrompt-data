The program is intended to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Let's analyze the provided implementation to see if it meets the requirements.

1. **Input**: The function takes three arguments: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. The problem description states that the two lists should be of the same size.

2. **Merging and Sorting**: The function merges the two lists and sorts them. This is a valid approach to find the median.

3. **Median Calculation**: The code calculates the median based on whether the size is even or odd. However, there are issues in the calculation:
   - The variable `middle_index` is set to `size - 1`, which is incorrect for determining the middle elements for median calculation. 
   - The correct `middle_index` for even-sized lists should be `size // 2 - 1` for the lower middle element and `size // 2` for the upper middle element.
   - The code does not handle the case where `size` is odd; it tries to access an index out of bounds.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If either of the input lists is empty, the function would throw an error.
   - If `size` is not passed correctly (e.g., if it does not match the actual size of `list1` and `list2`), it would lead to incorrect results or errors.

Considering the above points, particularly the incorrect index calculations and handling of edge cases, the program does not meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly compute the median in cases with even-sized lists and does not handle cases where the input lists might be empty. For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]` with `size = 2`, the computed median would be incorrect due to the wrong index used in the calculation.
