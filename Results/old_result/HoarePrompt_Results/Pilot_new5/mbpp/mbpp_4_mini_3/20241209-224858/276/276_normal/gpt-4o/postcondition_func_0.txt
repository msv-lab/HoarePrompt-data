The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of the same size `n`. It merges and sorts these lists, then calculates and returns the median of the sorted merged list. The function correctly handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list. However, it assumes that both input lists are of the same positive length, but does not handle cases where the lists might be empty or of different sizes, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
