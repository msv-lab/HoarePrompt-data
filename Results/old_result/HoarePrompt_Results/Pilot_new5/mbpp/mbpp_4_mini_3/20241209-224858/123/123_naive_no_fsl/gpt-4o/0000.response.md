To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to verify if the function `func_1` meets the requirement of splitting a list into two parts: the first part having a length of `L`, and the second part containing the remainder of the list.

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

The function uses slicing to split the list. 

### Valid Test Cases
The assertions provided check several cases:

1. For the input `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]` with `L = 3`, the output is `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`, which is correct.
2. For the input `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']` with `L = 2`, the output is `(['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])`, which is also correct.
3. For the input `['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']` with `L = 4`, the output is `(['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'])`, which is correct as well.

### Edge Cases
Now, we must consider edge cases to see if the function handles all scenarios:

1. **When `L` is greater than the length of the list**: If we call `func_1([1, 2], 5)`, it will return `([1, 2], [])`. This is not explicitly stated in the problem description, but it logically follows that if `L` exceeds the length of the list, the first part should take everything, and the second part should be empty. This works as expected.
   
2. **When `L` is negative**: The behavior of `lst[:L]` with a negative `L` will yield an empty list as `L` is interpreted as taking elements from the beginning of the list up to an index that is not valid. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3], -1)` will return `([], [1, 2, 3])`. The problem description does not specify how to handle negative values.

3. **When `L` is zero**: For an input of `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)`, the return would be `([], [1, 2, 3])`, which is also valid but not mentioned in the description.

### Conclusion
The function does not specify behavior for negative or zero values of `L`. Since the problem description does not clarify how these cases should be handled, and based on that, we find that there are scenarios in which the function does not adhere strictly to the problem description.

Therefore, given that the function could potentially return unexpected results for edge cases related to the value of `L`, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
