Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(lst, L)` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, which is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **List Splitting Logic**: The line `return lst[:L], lst[L:]` effectively splits the list into two parts:
   - `lst[:L]` retrieves the first `L` elements of the list.
   - `lst[L:]` retrieves the elements from index `L` to the end of the list.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - If `L` is `0`, `lst[:0]` returns an empty list, and `lst[0:]` returns the entire list, which matches the expected behavior.
   - If `L` equals `len(lst)`, `lst[:len(lst)]` returns the entire list, and `lst[len(lst):]` returns an empty list, again matching the expected behavior.

4. **Constraints**: The program assumes that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, which is stated to hold true before the function call. Hence, it doesn't need additional checks for this constraint within the function.

Since the function adheres to the specified requirements and correctly handles all potential cases as described, we conclude that the implementation is accurate.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
