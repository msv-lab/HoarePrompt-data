Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and an integer `L`. It splits the list into two parts based on the value of `L`:

1. The first part is created by slicing the list from the beginning up to index `L`, which is done using `lst[:L]`.
2. The second part is created by slicing the list from index `L` to the end, using `lst[L:]`.

This behavior meets the requirement of splitting the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`. The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests to verify that the function behaves correctly for various lists and values of `L`.

The function handles different types of lists (e.g., integers and strings) and correctly returns a tuple containing the two split lists. It also adheres to the constraint that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, ensuring that it doesn't encounter any index errors.

Overall, the implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description.
