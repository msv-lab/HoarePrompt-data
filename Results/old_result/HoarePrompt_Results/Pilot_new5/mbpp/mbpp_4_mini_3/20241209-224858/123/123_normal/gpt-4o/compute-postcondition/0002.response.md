Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`. It returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list is a slice of `lst` from the beginning up to index `L` (inclusive of index `L-1`), and the second list is a slice of `lst` from index `L` to the end. If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first list will contain all elements, and the second list will be empty. If `L` is 0, the first list will be empty, and the second list will contain all elements of `lst`.**
