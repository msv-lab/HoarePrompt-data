The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. `lst` is a list of elements, and `L` is a non-negative integer where the constraint is that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len}(lst)\). The function returns a tuple that contains the first `L` elements of the list `lst` and the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and return a tuple with the first `L` elements of `lst` and the elements from index `L` to the end of the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst (a list) and a parameter L (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst)), and returns a tuple containing the first L elements of lst and the remaining elements from index L to the end of lst.**
