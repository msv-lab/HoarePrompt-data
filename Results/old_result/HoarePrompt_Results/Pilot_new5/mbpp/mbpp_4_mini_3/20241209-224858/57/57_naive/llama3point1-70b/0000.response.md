Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The use of the `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. 

For example:
- Input: `[['banana', 'Apple'], ['cat', 'dog']]` would return `[['Apple', 'banana'], ['cat', 'dog']]`.
- Input: `[[], ['zebra', 'apple', 'Orange']]` would return `[[], ['apple', 'Orange', 'zebra']]`, maintaining the empty sublist and sorting the strings in the non-empty sublist correctly.

The program handles both empty sublists and different cases of strings properly, thereby satisfying all potential cases outlined in the problem description. Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.
