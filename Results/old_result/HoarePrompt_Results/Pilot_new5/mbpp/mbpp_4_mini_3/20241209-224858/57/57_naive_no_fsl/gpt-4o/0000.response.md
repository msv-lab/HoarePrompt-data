To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to examine the function `func_1`, which is supposed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. 

The implementation of `func_1` uses a list comprehension along with the `sorted()` function to sort each sublist. Let's analyze the examples given in the assertions:

1. The first assertion checks if `func_1` sorts the sublists `['green', 'orange']`, `['black', 'white']`, and `['white', 'black', 'orange']`. The expected output is `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. However, the correct sorted order of the last sublist should be `['black', 'orange', 'white']`. The function does not produce this expected output.

2. The second assertion involves sublists with leading/trailing spaces: `[' red ', 'green']`, `['blue ', ' black']`, and `[' orange', 'brown']`. The expected output is `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`. The function, however, would produce `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue'], [' brown', 'orange']]`, which is incorrect.

3. The third assertion checks `['zilver', 'gold']`, `['magnesium', 'aluminium']`, and `['steel', 'bronze']`. The expected output is `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`. The function correctly produces this output.

However, since the first two assertions don't hold true, the program is not functioning correctly for all potential cases.

Therefore, the overall correctness of the program can be concluded as:

Correctness: **False** 

The function does not handle the sorting of strings properly when there are spaces and does not produce the expected output for all provided test cases.
