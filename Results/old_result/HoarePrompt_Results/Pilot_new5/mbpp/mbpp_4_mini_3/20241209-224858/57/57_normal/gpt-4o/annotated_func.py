#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list of lists, where each sublist is sorted in ascending order, derived from the original 'list_of_lists' that contains strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists containing strings and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The function handles empty sublists correctly by returning them as is, resulting in a new list of lists that maintains the structure of the input while ensuring each sublist is sorted.
