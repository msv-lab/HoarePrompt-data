Correctness: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist contains strings. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist and applies the `sorted` function to sort the strings in a case-insensitive manner (using `key=str.lower`).

Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:
1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts a list of lists (`list_of_lists`), as stated in the problem description.
2. **Sorting Mechanism**: Each sublist is sorted using the `sorted` function, which sorts the strings in a case-insensitive manner by converting them to lowercase during sorting (`key=str.lower`).
3. **Output Structure**: The function returns a new list that contains the sorted sublists, preserving the overall list structure as specified.

Additionally, the comment regarding empty sublists states that these will remain as empty lists in the output. This does not violate the problem description, as it does not specify how to handle empty sublists.

Since the program correctly sorts each sublist of strings according to the requirements, it adheres to the problem description in all scenarios, including when it encounters empty sublists.

Thus, the program is correct and fully meets the problem description requirements.
