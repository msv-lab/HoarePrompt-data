Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly filters the entries of the input dictionary `d` based on the condition that the values must be greater than or equal to the integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension which iterates through all key-value pairs of the dictionary and includes only those pairs where the value meets the specified condition.

To verify its correctness, consider the following scenarios:

1. If `d = {'a': 10, 'b': 5, 'c': 3}` and `n = 5`, the function will return `{'a': 10, 'b': 5}`, which is correct as both 10 and 5 are greater than or equal to 5.
2. If `d = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}` and `n = 4`, it will return an empty dictionary `{}`, which is correct since no values meet the condition.
3. If `d = {}` (an empty dictionary) and any integer `n`, it will return `{}` as well, which is expected behavior.
4. If `d = {'key1': -1, 'key2': 0, 'key3': 1}` and `n = 0`, it will return `{'key2': 0, 'key3': 1}`, which correctly includes entries where the value is greater than or equal to 0.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly without any exceptions or errors, we can conclude the program is correct for all potential inputs outlined in the problem description. Thus, the conclusion is that the function works as expected.
