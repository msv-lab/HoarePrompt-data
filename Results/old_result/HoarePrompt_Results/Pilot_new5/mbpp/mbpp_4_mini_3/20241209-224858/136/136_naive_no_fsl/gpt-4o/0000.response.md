Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary and an integer `n`, and it filters the dictionary to include only those entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

The assertions provided in the program successfully test various scenarios:

1. For the input `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` with `n = 170`, it correctly returns `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`.
2. For `n = 180`, it returns `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`.
3. For `n = 190`, it returns `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`.

The logic of filtering based on the values in the dictionary is correctly implemented using a dictionary comprehension. 

No edge cases are missed, as all possible values in the provided test cases are handled appropriately, including the scenario where no entries meet the criteria. For instance, if `n` were greater than all values in the dictionary, it would return an empty dictionary, which is the expected behavior.

Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
