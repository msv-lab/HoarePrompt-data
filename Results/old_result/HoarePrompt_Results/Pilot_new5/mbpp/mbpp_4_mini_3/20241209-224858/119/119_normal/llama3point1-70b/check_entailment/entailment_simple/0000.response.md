Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing these two values in the order of `b` first and `a` second. 

This matches the problem description precisely, which states that the function should return a tuple with the second number (which is `b`) and then the first number (which is `a`). 

The function works for any data type for `a` and `b`, as indicated by the problem description, which also mentions that these can be any two values of any data type. The tuple is formed and returned correctly, satisfying the requirement.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases, confirming its correctness.
