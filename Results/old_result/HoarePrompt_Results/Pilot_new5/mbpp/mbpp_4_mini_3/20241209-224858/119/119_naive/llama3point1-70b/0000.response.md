Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description by taking two numbers `a` and `b`, and returning a tuple containing `b` first and `a` second. This behavior is consistent for all potential inputs, including negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. There are no edge cases that would cause the program to fail or produce incorrect outputs based on the given problem description.
