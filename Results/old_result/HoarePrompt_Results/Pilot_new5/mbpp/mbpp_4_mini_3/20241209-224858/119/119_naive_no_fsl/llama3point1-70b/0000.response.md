Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two input parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which matches the requirement of returning the second number first, followed by the first number. 

I considered various input scenarios, including positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, and even non-integer types (like floats or strings) that can be passed as parameters. In all cases, the function behaves as expected by returning the values in the correct order. 

Since I cannot find any input case where the program deviates from the expected behavior outlined in the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
