Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second parameter `b` followed by the first parameter `a`, which is exactly what the problem description states. The assertion tests confirm that the function behaves correctly for the given examples.

1. The function signature `def func_1(a, b):` correctly reflects that it takes two arguments.
2. The return statement `return b, a` ensures that the output is a tuple containing the values in the order specified (second number followed by the first number).
3. The assertions provided check specific cases, and they all pass, reinforcing that the function works as intended.

Since there are no edge cases or additional complexities mentioned in the problem description, and the function consistently produces the expected output, the program is correct.
