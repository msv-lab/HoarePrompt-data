Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`), converts the tuple into a list, and then concatenates this new list to the original list. 

I can verify that the function will work correctly for various potential inputs:

1. If both the list and the tuple are empty, the result will be an empty list, which is correct.
2. If the list is empty and the tuple contains elements, the result will just be the elements from the tuple, which is also correct.
3. If the list contains elements and the tuple is empty, the result will be the original list, which is correct.
4. If both the list and the tuple contain elements, they will be concatenated in the correct order.

Since I cannot find any input case where the program does not work as expected based on the provided description, the program is correct.
