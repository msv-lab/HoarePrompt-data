The provided program aims to concatenate a list and a tuple, returning a new list. 

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Code Analysis**:
    ```python
    def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
        return input_list + list(input_tuple)
    ```
   The function converts `input_tuple` to a list and concatenates it with `input_list`. Thus, the function should work properly, returning a new list that includes all elements from `input_list` followed by the elements from `input_tuple`.

2. **Consider Edge Cases**:
   - If `input_list` is empty and `input_tuple` is not empty, the result should be the elements of `input_tuple`.
   - If `input_tuple` is empty and `input_list` is not empty, the result should be the elements of `input_list`.
   - If both `input_list` and `input_tuple` are empty, the result should be an empty list.

3. **Output Hints Analysis**:
   The output hints state: "The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and the elements of `input_tuple` converted to a list. If `input_list` or `input_tuple` are empty, the function will still return a list with just the elements of the non-empty input."
   
   The hints accurately reflect the code's behavior in handling empty inputs. 

Both the code and hints appear to be consistent, and they correctly describe the function's behavior for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function behaves as expected according to the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately. It successfully concatenates a list and a tuple, returning the correct new list in all scenarios.
