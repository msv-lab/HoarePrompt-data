According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. For the loop to execute one more time, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one more sublist beyond what has already been processed. At the end of the last iteration, we have `max_sum` equal to `current_sum` (which is greater than float('-inf')), `max_list` equal to `sublist`, and `current_sum` equal to `sum(sublist)` if `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum`. If not, `max_sum` remains unchanged, `max_list` is an empty list, and `current_sum` is still equal to `sum(sublist)`.

To execute the loop again, we need to increment the index that progresses through `list_of_lists`. Therefore, we must have at least one more sublist to process.

State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is greater than float('-inf'); `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, and `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. Otherwise, `max_list` is an empty list and `current_sum` is still equal to `sum(sublist)`; `list_of_lists` must have at least one more sublist to iterate over.**
