Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist from the `list_of_lists` that has the highest sum of its elements. It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity to ensure that any sum of a sublist will be greater than this initial value. It then iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding sublist when a greater sum is found. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works as intended for the given test cases. 

There are no edge cases that seem unhandled, as the function would still return the correct sublist even if all sublists have negative sums or if the input is an empty list (though an empty list case is not explicitly tested). Thus, it correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.
