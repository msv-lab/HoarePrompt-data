According to the code, the for loop iterates over `list_of_lists`, which means it will continue executing as long as there are more sublists to process in `list_of_lists`. The loop will execute for each sublist in that list. At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is equal to the previous `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, and `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is another sublist available in `list_of_lists`. If we denote the current sublist as `sublist`, then after this iteration, the next sublist in the list will be accessed during the next iteration.

Thus, if `list_of_lists` had `n` sublists, and the loop has processed `k` sublists so far, the next sublist would be the `(k + 1)`th sublist. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `n`, meaning that `list_of_lists` must have at least `k + 1` sublists.

State: **`max_sum` is equal to the previous `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, and `list_of_lists` must have at least `k + 1` sublists.**
