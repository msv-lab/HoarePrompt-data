The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. The previous values of `max_sum`, `current_sum`, and `list_of_lists` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updates made.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, and `list_of_lists` must have at least `k + 1` sublists; `max_list` is now equal to `sublist`.**
