The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`. `lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (either integers or floats). After executing the function body, it returns the inner list from `lists` that has the maximum sum of its numerical elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of lists and return the inner list with the highest sum of its numerical elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lists, which is a list of lists containing numerical elements, and returns the inner list with the maximum sum of its numerical elements.**
