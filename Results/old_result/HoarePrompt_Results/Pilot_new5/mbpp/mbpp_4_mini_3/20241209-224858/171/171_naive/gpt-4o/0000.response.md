Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly identifies whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The logic `return n % 2 != 0` effectively returns `True` for odd numbers (where `n % 2` equals 1) and `False` for even numbers (where `n % 2` equals 0). The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the test cases of 12 (even), 7 (odd), and 10 (even). There are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause the function to fail for any integer input.
