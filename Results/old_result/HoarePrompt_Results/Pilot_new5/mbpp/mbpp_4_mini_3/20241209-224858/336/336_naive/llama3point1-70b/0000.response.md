Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the list is empty. If `lst` is an empty list `[]`, the function will return `True`, which is misleading since there are no odd indices to check. According to the problem description, it should be defined what the expected output is for an empty list. Additionally, if the list contains a single element, the function will not have an odd index to verify, leading to ambiguous behavior. Thus, there are cases where it does not meet the problem requirements correctly.
