According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst`. The loop will execute if the length of `lst` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `lst` must not be empty, and the initial value of `i` will be 0. 

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
