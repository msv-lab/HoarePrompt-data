Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Odd Index Check**: The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks each odd index up to the length of the list. This aligns with the requirement of checking whether every odd index contains odd numbers.

2. **Even Number Check**: Within the loop, the function checks if the number at the odd index is even using the condition `if lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If any odd indexed number is found to be even, it immediately returns `False`, which correctly indicates that not all odd indexed numbers are odd.

3. **Return True**: If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indexed elements are indeed odd.

4. **Edge Cases**: The annotations mention that if the list is empty or has only one element, the function will return `True`, as there are no odd indexed elements to check. This is consistent with the description, ensuring that the function behaves correctly for edge cases.

The assertions provided also validate that the function works correctly for various input scenarios. Therefore, the program meets the specifications laid out in the problem description.
