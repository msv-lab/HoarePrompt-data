Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that every odd index in the list must contain odd numbers. However, the program checks for even numbers at odd indices and returns `False` if it finds any, which is the opposite of what is required.

For example, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
- The odd indices are 1 and 3. The values at these indices are 2 and 4, both of which are even.
- According to the problem description, the function should return `False` since there are even numbers at odd indices.

However, if we consider the input list `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, the program would return `True`, which is correct in this case, but it only does so because the odd indexed values happen to be odd. 

The program essentially checks for even numbers at odd indices and would return `True` in cases where this condition is not violated, but this does not align with the requirement that odd indices must contain odd numbers. Thus, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all possible cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
