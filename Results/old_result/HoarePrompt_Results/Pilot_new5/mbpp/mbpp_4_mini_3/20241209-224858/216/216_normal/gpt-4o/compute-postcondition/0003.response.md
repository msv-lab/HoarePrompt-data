`lst_sorted` is assigned the value of the sorted version of `lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged, but `lst_sorted` now contains the elements of `lst` arranged in ascending order. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty; `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty; `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`.**
