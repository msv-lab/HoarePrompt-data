According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `i < len(lst_sorted) - 1` holds true. Currently, at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the length of `lst_sorted` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. 

Since `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2 for `i` to remain less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1` (which would be 1 in this case), this means that `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

Furthermore, the difference between the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` in `lst_sorted` still needs to be equal to 1, but since we're currently focused on the indices and their conditions, we will note that `i` is now 1.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`, `i` is 1, `len(lst_sorted) must be greater than or equal to 2, and the difference between the elements at indices 1 and 2 in `lst_sorted` is equal to 1.**
