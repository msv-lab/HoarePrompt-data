To determine the correctness of the annotated program in relation to the provided problem description, we need to analyze what the program does and whether it meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

**Problem Description:**
The function must check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

**Annotated Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

1. **Sorting the List:**
   - The program sorts the list `lst`, which is a reasonable first step to check for consecutive numbers.

2. **Checking for Consecutiveness:**
   - The line `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` checks if every pair of consecutive elements (after sorting) has a difference of 1. This is a correct approach to determine if the numbers are consecutive.

3. **Checking for Uniqueness:**
   - The condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` checks if all elements in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list with the length of the set created from the list. This ensures there are no duplicate numbers.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns `True` only if both conditions (consecutiveness and uniqueness) are satisfied.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly checks for both the conditions specified in the problem: 
- It verifies that the numbers are consecutive by checking the difference between sorted elements.
- It ensures that all elements are unique by comparing the lengths of the list and the set.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
