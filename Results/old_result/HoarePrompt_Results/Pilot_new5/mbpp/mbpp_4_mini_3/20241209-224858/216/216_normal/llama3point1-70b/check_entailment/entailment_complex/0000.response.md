Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully adhere to the problem description, which simply states that it should check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The program, however, enforces two conditions: 

1. The integers must be consecutive (the difference between each consecutive integer should be 1).
2. All elements in the list must be unique (no duplicates allowed).

The problem description does not specify that the integers need to be unique; it only mentions that the function should check for consecutive numbers. This means that the program may incorrectly return `False` for lists that contain consecutive numbers but also have duplicates. 

For example, the list `[1, 2, 2, 3]` contains the consecutive numbers 1, 2, and 3, but the program would return `False` because of the duplicate '2'. Thus, it does not satisfy the requirement of checking for consecutive numbers only, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is incorrect according to the problem description.
