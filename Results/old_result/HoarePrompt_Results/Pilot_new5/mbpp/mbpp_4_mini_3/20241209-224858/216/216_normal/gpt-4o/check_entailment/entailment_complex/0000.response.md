Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. Here's why it meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Handling Empty List**: The function first checks if the input list `lst` is empty. If it is, the function returns `False`, which correctly indicates that an empty list does not contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting the List**: The input list is sorted using `sorted(lst)`. This step is crucial because it allows the function to evaluate the adjacency of numbers in their natural order.

3. **Checking for Consecutive Numbers**: The for loop iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1. If any pair does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`, which correctly indicates that not all numbers in the list are consecutive.

4. **Returning True for Consecutive Numbers**: If all adjacent elements differ by exactly 1, the function returns `True`, confirming that the list contains consecutive numbers.

The assertions provided in the code also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected in these scenarios:
- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` correctly returns `True`.
- `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` correctly returns `False` as there is a gap between 3 and 5.
- `[1, 2, 1]` correctly returns `False` since the number 1 is repeated and not consecutive.

Thus, the function meets all specified requirements for the problem description and handles potential edge cases correctly.
