Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, and `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst` with at least two elements. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. If the difference is equal to 1, there is no return value specified.***
