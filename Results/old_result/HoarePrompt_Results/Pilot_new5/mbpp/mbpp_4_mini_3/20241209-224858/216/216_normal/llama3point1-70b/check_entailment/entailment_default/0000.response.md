Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description and output hints.

**Problem description:** The task is to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The requirements are that the numbers must be consecutive (each differing from the next by 1) and they must all be unique.

**Program code:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

**Initial assessment:**
1. The program first sorts the list, which is necessary to compare consecutive elements.
2. It uses the `all()` function to check if each pair of consecutive numbers differs by 1. This ensures that all elements are consecutive.
3. It checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list to ensure all numbers are unique.

**Edge case considerations:**
- An empty list: The function will return `True` since `all()` will return `True` for an empty iterator, but logically it doesn't contain any consecutive numbers. Therefore, it should return `False`.
- A list with a single element: Similarly, it will return `True`, but again, this should logically return `False` since a single number cannot be consecutive.
- Lists with duplicates: The function correctly checks for duplicates; however, if duplicates exist, the function will return `False` as expected.
  
**Output hints:** The function is said to return `True` if the integers are consecutive and unique, and `False` otherwise, including if the list is empty or contains duplicates.

**Discrepancy with output hints:**
The output hints say it returns `False` for empty lists or duplicates, which is correct. However, the behavior for lists with zero or one element is not adequately addressed since logically they cannot be considered as having consecutive numbers.

**Final evaluation:**
The code does not correctly handle cases for empty lists and lists with a single element. Both should logically return `False`, but the current implementation incorrectly returns `True` for these cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails for edge cases like an empty list or a single-element list, which both should return `False` according to the problem description.
