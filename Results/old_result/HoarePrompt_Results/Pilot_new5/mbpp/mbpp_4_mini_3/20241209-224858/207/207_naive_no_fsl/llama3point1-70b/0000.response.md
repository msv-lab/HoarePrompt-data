Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width. 

1. The function `func_1(length, width)` takes two arguments, `length` and `width`.
2. It correctly calculates the area by multiplying these two values together (`length * width`).
3. The multiplication operation is valid for positive numbers, and the function will return the correct area for valid inputs.

Additionally, it should be noted that the area of a rectangle is defined as positive when both dimensions are non-negative. The program does not explicitly handle negative inputs or zero dimensions, but since the task is to calculate area, typically it is assumed that length and width are non-negative. 

In all common scenarios where the function is used with non-negative numbers, the output will be correct. Thus, there are no potential cases found where the program does not work as expected.
