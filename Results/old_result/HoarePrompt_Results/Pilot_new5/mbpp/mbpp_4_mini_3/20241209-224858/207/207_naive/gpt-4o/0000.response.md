Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where either the length or width of the rectangle is zero or negative. According to the problem description, the area of a rectangle is calculated as `length * width`, which cannot be valid when either dimension is zero or negative. For example, calling `func_1(0, 5)` or `func_1(-1, 5)` should return `0` or raise an error, but the current implementation will return `0` in both cases without any validation, which is misleading as it implies a valid rectangle area when it's not.
