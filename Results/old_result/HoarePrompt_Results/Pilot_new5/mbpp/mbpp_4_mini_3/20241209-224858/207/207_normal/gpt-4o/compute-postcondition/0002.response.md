Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which can be non-negative integers or floats. It calculates and returns the area of a rectangle by multiplying `length` and `width`. The function does not handle potential edge cases where either parameter is negative, but it is designed to work with non-negative values as specified in the input constraints.**
