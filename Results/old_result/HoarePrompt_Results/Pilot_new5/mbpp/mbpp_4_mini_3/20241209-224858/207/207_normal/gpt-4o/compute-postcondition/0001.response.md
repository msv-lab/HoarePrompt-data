The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` are non-negative integers or floats representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function returns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as the product of `length` and `width`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative integers or floats `length` and `width`, and return the area of the rectangle calculated as `length * width`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters length and width, returns the area of the rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width.**
