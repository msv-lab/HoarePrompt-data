Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully comply with the problem description because, while it correctly calculates the area of a rectangle for non-negative values of `length` and `width`, it does not handle the case where either parameter is negative. The problem description specifies that the function should find the area of a rectangle, which typically assumes non-negative dimensions. However, the program lacks explicit checks to ensure that the inputs are non-negative.

For instance, if a user were to call `func_1(-5, 10)`, the program would return -50, which is not a valid area for a rectangle. This indicates that the implementation is not robust against invalid inputs, thus failing to meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases. 

Therefore, since it does not guarantee correct behavior for all possible inputs, the program is deemed incorrect.
