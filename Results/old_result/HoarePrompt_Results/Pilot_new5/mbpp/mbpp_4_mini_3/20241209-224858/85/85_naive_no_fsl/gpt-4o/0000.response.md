Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

### Explanation:
1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `arr` as input.
2. It calculates the minimum value using `min(arr)` and the maximum value using `max(arr)`.
3. The maximum difference is then calculated as `max_val - min_val`.
4. This methodology accurately computes the maximum difference because:
   - The maximum difference between any two elements in an array occurs between the largest and smallest values.
5. The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works for the provided test cases.

Additionally, there are no edge cases (such as empty arrays or arrays with a single element) that the code fails to handle, since the problem description does not specify handling for those cases. Thus, the code behaves as expected for the valid inputs it processes.
