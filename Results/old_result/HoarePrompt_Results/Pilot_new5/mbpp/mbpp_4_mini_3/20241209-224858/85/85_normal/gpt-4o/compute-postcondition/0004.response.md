The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it returns the difference between the maximum integer `max_val` and the minimum integer `min_val` in the list `arr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return the difference between the maximum and minimum values in that list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers, and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list.**
