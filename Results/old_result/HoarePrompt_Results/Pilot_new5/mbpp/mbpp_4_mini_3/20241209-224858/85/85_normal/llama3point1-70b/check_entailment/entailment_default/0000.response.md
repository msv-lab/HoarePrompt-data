The provided program aims to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by using the `max()` and `min()` functions. The problem description states that the function should perform this operation, but it does not specify how to handle empty arrays. 

### Initial Assessment:
- The `func_1(arr)` function correctly computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array when the array is non-empty. However, it will raise a `ValueError` if the array is empty, as neither `max()` nor `min()` can be applied to an empty sequence.

### Edge Cases:
- An important edge case to consider is when the input array `arr` is empty. In such a case, the function would fail, which contradicts the expectation that the function should handle all cases as described. The function assumes that the input will always contain at least one integer but does not safeguard against the possibility of receiving an empty list.

### Output Hints Evaluation:
- The output hints confirm that the function will raise a `ValueError` for an empty list and indicate that the function is expected to assume the input list will always contain at least one integer. This means that the function does not meet the requirement to handle all potential cases laid out in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle the edge case of an empty list and thus does not follow the problem description for every potential case, the final assessment of correctness is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The code fails to account for the scenario where the input array could be empty, leading to a `ValueError`, which is incorrect as per the problem requirements.
