Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input list `arr` is empty. The problem description requires a function that finds the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, but if the array is empty, the program will raise a `ValueError` due to the usage of `max()` and `min()` functions, which cannot operate on an empty list. 

In addition, the program computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the same as finding the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. For example, if the array contains negative and positive values, the maximum difference might not simply be the difference between the global max and min, especially if there are other elements that may yield a larger difference.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the conditions of the problem description for every potential case, particularly when the input list is empty or contains only one element.
