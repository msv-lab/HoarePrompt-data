#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum integer `max_val` and the minimum integer `min_val` in the list `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum integer and the minimum integer in the list. If the list is empty, it will raise a ValueError due to the use of the `min()` and `max()` functions, which cannot operate on an empty sequence.
