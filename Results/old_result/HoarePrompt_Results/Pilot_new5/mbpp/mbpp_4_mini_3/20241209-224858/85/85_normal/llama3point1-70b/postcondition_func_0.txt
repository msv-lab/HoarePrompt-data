The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. If the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` due to the use of `max()` and `min()` functions, which do not handle empty lists. Therefore, the function assumes that the input list will always contain at least one integer.
