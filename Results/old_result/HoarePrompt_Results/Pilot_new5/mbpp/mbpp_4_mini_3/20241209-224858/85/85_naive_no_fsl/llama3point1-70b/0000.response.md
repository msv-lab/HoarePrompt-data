Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does this by using the `max()` function to find the largest element and the `min()` function to find the smallest element in the array. The difference between these two values yields the maximum difference.

To validate this, consider various test cases:

1. For an input array like `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]`, the maximum is `9` and the minimum is `1`, so the difference `9 - 1 = 8`.
2. For an input array like `[10, 2, 8]`, the maximum is `10` and the minimum is `2`, leading to a difference of `10 - 2 = 8`.
3. If the array has only one element, for example, `[5]`, both the max and min will be `5`, resulting in `5 - 5 = 0`, which still correctly represents the maximum difference in this case (which is `0` as there's no second element).
4. An empty array would raise a ValueError due to calling `max()` and `min()` on an empty sequence.

Since the program meets the requirements for the cases considered, and I cannot find an example where it fails based on the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct. However, the edge case of an empty array is not handled, which means my original thought of correctness needs reconsideration.

Correctness: **False**

The case of an empty array will cause the program to throw an error, meaning it does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Hence, the program is incorrect.
