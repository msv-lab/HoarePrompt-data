According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `_` in the range from 2 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2, given that the starting point of the range is 2. 

Before the loop starts, we know that `n` is a non-negative integer that is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, which means `n` is at least 2. Thus, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure the loop executes. The initial values of `a` and `b` are not directly impacting the loop execution.

Since we are also tracking the loop's starting parameters, at the start of the loop, `_` will begin with 2, which is the first value in the range. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `_` is 2**
