The code assigns new values to `a` and `b` where `a` takes the current value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`. Initially, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4. After executing the code, the values change as follows: 

- `a` takes the value of `b`, which is 4.
- `b` takes the value of `a + b`, which is `3 + 4 = 7`.

Thus, after the execution:

- `n` remains greater than or equal to 4, 
- `a` is updated to 4, 
- `b` is updated to 7. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7**.
