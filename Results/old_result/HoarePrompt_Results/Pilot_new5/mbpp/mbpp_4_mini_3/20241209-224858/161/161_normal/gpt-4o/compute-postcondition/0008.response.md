The code `a, b = b, a + b` simultaneously assigns new values to `a` and `b`. The value of `b` becomes the previous value of `a`, which is 2. The value of `a` becomes the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. Therefore, after executing the code, the updated values are `a = 3` and `b = 2`. The values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 2, `_` is 2**
