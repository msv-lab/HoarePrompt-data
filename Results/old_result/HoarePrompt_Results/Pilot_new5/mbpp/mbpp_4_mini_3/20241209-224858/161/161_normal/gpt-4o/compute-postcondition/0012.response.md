After executing the code `a, b = b, a + b`, the values of `a` and `b` are updated. 

- The previous value of `b` is 5.
- The previous value of `a` is 2.
- The new value of `a` will be assigned the previous value of `b`, which is 5.
- The new value of `b` will be assigned the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`, which is 2 + 5 = 7.

All other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 5, `b` is 7, `_` is 4.
Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 5, `b` is 7, `_` is 4**.
