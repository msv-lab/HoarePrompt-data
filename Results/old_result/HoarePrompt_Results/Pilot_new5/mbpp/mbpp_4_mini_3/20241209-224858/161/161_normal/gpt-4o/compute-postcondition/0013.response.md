To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop and the initial conditions provided.

The loop operates as follows:
- It begins with `a` as 2 and `b` as 1.
- The loop iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will execute a total of `n - 1` times since it starts at 2.

Initially:
- `a` is 2
- `b` is 1

From the output states provided:
1. After 1 iteration: `a` becomes 3, `b` becomes 2.
2. After 2 iterations: `a` is reset to 2, `b` becomes 5.
3. After 3 iterations: `a` becomes 5, `b` becomes 7.

Now, let's analyze the pattern:
- The loop updates `a` and `b` such that after the first iteration, `a` takes the value of `b` and `b` takes the value of the previous `a + b`.
- As the loop continues, `a` essentially takes the value of `b` from the previous iteration, and `b` takes the sum of the previous `a` and `b`.

To conclude what the values of `a` and `b` will be after all iterations:
- After completion, `a` will represent the (n-1)th Fibonacci number starting from `a=2` and `b=1`.
- `b` will represent the nth Fibonacci number.

Since the loop executes `n - 1` times, we can observe that:
- The last value of `b` will be the nth Fibonacci number due to the nature of the Fibonacci sequence and how `a` and `b` are updated in each iteration.

Thus, for the final output state after all iterations:
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number, `b` is the nth Fibonacci number.**
