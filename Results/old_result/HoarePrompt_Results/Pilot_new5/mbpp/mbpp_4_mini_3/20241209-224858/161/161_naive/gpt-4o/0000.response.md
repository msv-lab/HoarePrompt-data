Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has an issue. The function is designed to return the nth Lucas number, but it fails to handle the case where n is negative. According to the Lucas number definition, the sequence is only defined for non-negative integers. For a negative input, the function does not specify a behavior; thus, it could lead to unexpected results or an error.

For example, if we call `func_1(-1)`, the program does not have a defined output, which violates the problem description since it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
