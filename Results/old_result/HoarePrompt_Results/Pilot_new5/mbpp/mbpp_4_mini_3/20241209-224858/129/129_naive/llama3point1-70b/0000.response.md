Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a single character using the `ord()` function. It takes a string input, which is expected to be a single character, and returns the corresponding ASCII value. 

Since the function only processes a single character, it does not account for any edge cases like an empty string or multiple characters. However, as per the problem description, it is implied that the input will be a single character. Therefore, under the assumption that the input will always be valid, the program behaves correctly for any valid single character input, returning the correct ASCII value in each case.
