#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode code point of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function, which corresponds to the Unicode code point of that character. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string, which may lead to a TypeError if the input is not a string or if more than one character is provided.
