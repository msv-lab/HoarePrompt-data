According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters remaining in `num_str`. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`, and `digit` is the first character of `num_str`. Since `num_len` is at least 1, it indicates that there are still digits left in `num_str`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `digit` becomes the next character in `num_str`, and we also need to ensure the length of `num_str` decreases by 1. Specifically, if `num_len` is the length of `num_str` before the iteration starts, it will now need to be `num_len - 1`. As the loop iterates, `digit` will refer to the next character in the string.

Thus, the new state should reflect that `digit` is now the next character in the string (which will depend on the specific character at that position), and `num_len` needs to be decreased by 1.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (>= 0), `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num` with at least 1 character remaining, `num_len` is at least 1, `digit` is the next character in `num_str`, `sum` is updated to `sum + int(digit)`**
