The code updates `sum` by adding `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`. The values of `num`, `num_str`, and `digit` will remain unchanged, but `sum` will be updated based on its previous value and the result of the calculation.

Given that `num` is a non-negative integer (>= 0), `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num`, `num_len` is at least 1, and `digit` is the next character in `num_str`, we can express `sum` as:

- If `digit` is a character representing a digit (0-9), then `int(digit)` will be a non-negative integer (>= 0).
- Thus, `sum` is updated to `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (>= 0), `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num` with at least 1 character remaining, `num_len` is at least 1, `digit` is the next character in `num_str`, `sum` is updated to `sum + int(digit) ** num_len**.
