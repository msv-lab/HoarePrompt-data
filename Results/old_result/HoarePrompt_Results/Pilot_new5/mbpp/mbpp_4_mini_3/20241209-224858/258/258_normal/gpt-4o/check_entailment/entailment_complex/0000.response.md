The provided function `func_1(n)` checks whether a given non-negative integer `n` is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Let's analyze the function against the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, which is explicitly stated in the problem description.
  
2. **Processing**:
   - The function converts the integer `n` to a string to process its digits.
   - It calculates the length of the string representation of `n`, which corresponds to the number of digits.
   - It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.

3. **Output**: The function returns `True` if the computed sum equals `n`, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The assertions provided in the annotated program:
- `func_1(153)` returns `True` because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` because \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259\).
- `func_1(4458)` returns `False` because \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458\).

There are no issues with the implementation, as it correctly follows the logic required to determine if a number is an Armstrong number. It handles all non-negative integers appropriately.

Thus, the function correctly implements the requirements as stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
