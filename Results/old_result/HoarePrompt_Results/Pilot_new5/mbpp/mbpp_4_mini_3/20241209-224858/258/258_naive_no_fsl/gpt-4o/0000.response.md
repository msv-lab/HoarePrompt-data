Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It converts the number to a string to facilitate the iteration over each digit.
3. It calculates the number of digits in `n` by finding the length of the string representation.
4. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits.
5. Finally, it checks if the computed sum equals the original number `n`.

The assertions provided in the code also validate the correctness of the function for specific cases:
- `func_1(153)` is `True`, as \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `func_1(259)` is `False`, as \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259\).
- `func_1(4458)` is `False`, as \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458\).

Since the function correctly identifies Armstrong numbers for the tested cases and adheres to the problem description without any missing logic, edge cases, or incorrect assumptions, the program is deemed correct.
