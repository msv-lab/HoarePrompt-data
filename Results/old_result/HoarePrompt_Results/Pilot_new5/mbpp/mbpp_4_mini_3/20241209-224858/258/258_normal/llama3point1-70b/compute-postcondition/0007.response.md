According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `num_str`. The loop will execute again if there are still characters remaining in `num_str`. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the next character in `num_str`, and since `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num` with at least 1 character remaining, `num_str` must have at least 1 more character for the loop to execute again. 

`num_len` indicates the length of `num_str`, which was at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num_len` needs to be decremented by 1 (indicating that one character has been processed) and `digit` must be updated to the next character in `num_str`. 

Thus, if `num_len` was at least 1, after one iteration it must be at least 1 (indicating thereâ€™s still at least one character left). 

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (>= 0), `num_str` is a non-empty string representation of `num` with at least 1 character remaining, `num_len` is at least 1, `digit` is the next character in `num_str`, `sum` is updated to `sum + int(digit)`**
