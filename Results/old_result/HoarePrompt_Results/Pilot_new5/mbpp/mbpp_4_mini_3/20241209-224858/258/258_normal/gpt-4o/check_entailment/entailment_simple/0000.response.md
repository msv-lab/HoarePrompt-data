Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for an n-digit number is an integer such that the sum of its digits raised to the power n equals the number itself. For example, for the number 153, which has 3 digits, \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153 \).

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes a non-negative integer `n`.
   - It converts `n` to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
   - It calculates the number of digits (length) using `len(num_str)`.
   - The sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits is calculated using a generator expression within the `sum()` function.
   - Finally, it checks if this sum is equal to `n` and returns `True` or `False`.

3. **Assertions**: 
   - The assertions provided in the annotated program check various cases:
     - `func_1(153)`: This should return `True` since 153 is an Armstrong number.
     - `func_1(259)`: This should return `False` since 259 is not an Armstrong number.
     - `func_1(4458)`: This should return `False` since 4458 is not an Armstrong number.

Since the implementation correctly checks for Armstrong numbers as per the problem description and passes the assertions, the program is indeed correct.
