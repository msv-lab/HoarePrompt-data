Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least one sublist. If the length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is set to the length of `lst`, and `max_list` is set to `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not greater than `max_len`, the values of `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
