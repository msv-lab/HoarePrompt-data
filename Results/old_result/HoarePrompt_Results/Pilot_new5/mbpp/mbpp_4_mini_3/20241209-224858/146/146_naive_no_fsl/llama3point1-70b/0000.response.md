To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program itself.

**Problem description**: The task is to write a function that finds the list(s) of maximum length in a list of lists.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The program calculates the maximum length of the sublists using the `max` function.
2. It then constructs a list of all sublists that match this maximum length.
3. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist that is of that maximum length.

### Potential Issues:
- **Empty Input Case**: If `list_of_lists` is empty (`[]`), `max()` will raise a `ValueError` since it cannot determine the maximum of an empty iterable. The program does not handle this case.
- **Multiple Maximum Sublists**: The program only returns the first sublist of maximum length. While the problem description does not specify that all maximum length sublists should be returned, it does imply that finding the maximum length is part of the requirement. The returned output may not be comprehensive.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the case of an empty list of lists and would raise an error, we can definitively say that the implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False** 

**Example of Failure**: If we call `func_1([])`, it will raise a `ValueError` due to the empty input, which clearly shows that the program does not work correctly for at least one potential case.
