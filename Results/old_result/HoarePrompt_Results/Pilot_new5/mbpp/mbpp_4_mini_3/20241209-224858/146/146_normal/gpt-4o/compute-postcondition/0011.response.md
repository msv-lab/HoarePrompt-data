According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list contains at least 3 sublists, the loop will execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `list_of_lists` must have at least 3 sublists. The variable `lst` will represent the third sublist in the list.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 3 sublists, lst is the third sublist**
