Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Empty Input Handling**: The function does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. If an empty list is passed to `func_1`, the call to `max()` will raise a `ValueError`, as there are no sublists to evaluate. This is a significant oversight, as the problem description does not specify what to do when the input is empty.

2. **Output Requirements**: According to the problem description, the function should return "the list of maximum length in a list of lists." However, the function only returns the maximum length and the first sublist of maximum length, rather than all sublists that share the maximum length. This does not fully satisfy the requirement to return all maximum-length lists.

Because of these issues, the program is not correct as it does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
