The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the longest sublist in a list of lists and return both the length of that sublist and the sublist itself. Let's analyze the program step-by-step.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Function Logic**: The function initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list. It then iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`. If the current sublist's length is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and `max_list` accordingly. Finally, it returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.

2. **Expected Behavior**: According to the problem description, the output should be the length of the longest sublist along with that sublist. If the input list is empty, the function must return `(0, [])`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Input List**: If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function does not explicitly handle this case. As written, it would return `(0, [])` by default since `max_len` and `max_list` are initialized to `0` and `[]`, respectively, and the loop would not execute.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints indicate that the function should return `(0, [])` when given an empty list, which is consistent with how the function is structured. The provided assertions suggest that the function behaves correctly for various non-empty list inputs provided in the hints.

### Conclusion:
Since no edge cases are missed by the function, and the output hints confirm that it behaves as intended, I believe the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function successfully identifies the longest sublist in all tested cases, including returning the correct result for an empty input list scenario.
