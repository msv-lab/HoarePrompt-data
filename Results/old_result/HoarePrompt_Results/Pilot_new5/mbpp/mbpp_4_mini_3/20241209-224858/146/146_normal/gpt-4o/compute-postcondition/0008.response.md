The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of `len(lst)`, where `lst` is one of the sublists within `list_of_lists`. The initial state mentions that `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, but we don't have the specific lengths of these sublists or which one `lst` refers to. Therefore, the value of `max_len` will depend on the length of the specific sublist assigned to `lst`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 sublists, `max_len` is the length of the specified sublist `lst`, `max_list` is unchanged**
