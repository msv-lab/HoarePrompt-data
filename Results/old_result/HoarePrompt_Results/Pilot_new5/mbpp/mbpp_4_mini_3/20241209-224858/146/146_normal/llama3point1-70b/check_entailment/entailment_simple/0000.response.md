Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description requirements. According to the problem description, the function should return the list(s) of maximum length from the given list of lists. However, the program currently returns only the maximum length and the first sublist that has this maximum length, rather than all sublists that share this maximum length.

For example, if the input is:
```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9]]
```
The expected output should be the list of lists with the maximum length (which are `[3, 4, 5]` and `[6, 7, 8]` in this case). But the program will return:
```python
(3, [3, 4, 5])
```
This output does not fulfill the requirement to return the list(s) of maximum length. Thus, the program does not adhere to the problem description.
