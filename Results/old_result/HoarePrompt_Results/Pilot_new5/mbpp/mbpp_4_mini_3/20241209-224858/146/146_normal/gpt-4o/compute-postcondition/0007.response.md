According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. Since the loop iterates over `list_of_lists`, for it to execute one more time, there must be at least two sublists in `list_of_lists`. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `list_of_lists` must contain at least two sublists. The next `lst` will be the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 sublists, `max_len` is unchanged, `max_list` is unchanged**
