The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. The state of `lst` is not provided, but `max_list` now references the same object as `lst`. The other variables, including `list_of_lists` and `max_len`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 sublists, `max_len` is the length of the specified sublist `lst`, and `max_list` is now equal to `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 sublists, `max_len` is the length of the specified sublist `lst`, and `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
