Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in the handling of multiple occurrences of the substring within the main string.

1. The problem description states that the function should find the occurrence and position of **all** substrings within the string. However, the given implementation only finds the **first** occurrence of the substring using `main_string.find(sub_string)`. 

2. If the substring appears multiple times in the main string, the current implementation will only return the position of the very first occurrence and will not find or return any subsequent occurrences.

3. Additionally, the program does not provide a way to return all occurrences and their respective positions, which is a crucial requirement as per the problem description.

Hence, because the function does not meet the requirement of finding all occurrences of the substring, it does not correctly implement the problem as intended.
