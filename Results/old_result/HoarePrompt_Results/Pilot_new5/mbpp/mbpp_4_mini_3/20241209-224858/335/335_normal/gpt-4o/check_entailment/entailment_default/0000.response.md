To assess the correctness of the provided function `func_1`, let's break down the task step by step:

### Problem Description
The function is supposed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a given string, returning a tuple with the substring and its start and end positions if found, or None if not found.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)
```
- The function uses `find()` to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If the substring is not found, `find()` returns `-1`, and the function correctly returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, it calculates the start position and computes the end position by adding the length of the substring to the starting index.
- It returns a tuple containing the `sub_string`, `start_pos`, and `end_pos`.

### Edge Case Consideration
1. **Empty String Inputs**: If either `main_string` or `sub_string` is an empty string, the function does not explicitly handle this case. According to the problem description, we might expect that searching for an empty substring in a non-empty string should return the start and end indices 0 and 0, or none based on interpretations. However, the current implementation will return (sub_string, 0, 0) if `sub_string` is empty.
  
2. **Substring at the End of String**: The function seems to handle this correctly since `end_pos` is calculated as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`, which will accurately reflect the end index.

3. **Case Sensitivity**: The function is case-sensitive. If the `main_string` contains 'Python' and `sub_string` is 'python', it will not find a match. This may or may not be intended based on the problem description.

### Output Hints Review
- The output hints confirm that the function checks if `sub_string` exists within `main_string` and returns the expected output for found and not found cases. 
- They also align with the provided examples that the function behaves correctly for indicated scenarios.

### Conclusion
While the function works well for the provided examples, it does not explicitly handle cases such as empty input for `sub_string` or `main_string`, nor does it address the case sensitivity aspect comprehensively. Therefore, the function does not adhere to the problem description in every potential case.

**Correctness: False**. 

The program does not consider the edge case of empty substring input correctly and lacks clarity on whether case sensitivity should be accounted for based on the problem description.
