Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the substring within the string. According to the problem description, the program should find the occurrence and position of all instances of the substring, but it only finds the first occurrence. For example, if the input is `string = "hello world hello"` and `substring = "hello"`, the program will only return the position of the first "hello" and ignore the second occurrence. This means it does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description.
