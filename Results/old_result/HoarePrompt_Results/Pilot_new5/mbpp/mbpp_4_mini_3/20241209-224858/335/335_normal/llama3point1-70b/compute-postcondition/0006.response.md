The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. Both `string` and `substring` are non-empty strings, and `substring` is a valid substring of `string`. 

- Case_1: If the substring is not found in the string, the function returns `None`, indicating that the substring was not found.
- Case_2: If the substring is found in the string, the function returns the `substring`, its starting index, and its ending index minus one, where the starting index is the position of `substring` in `string`, and the ending index is calculated as the starting index plus the length of `substring`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-empty strings, `string` and `substring`, and return the substring along with its starting and ending indices if found, or return `None` if the substring is not found in the string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `string` and `substring`, returns None if `substring` is not found in `string`; if found, it returns `substring`, its starting index, and its ending index minus one.**
