In the given code snippet, `start` is assigned the value returned by the `find` method of the `string` variable, which searches for the first occurrence of the `substring`. Since the `substring` is confirmed to be a valid substring of `string`, the `find` method will return a valid index (which is a non-negative integer) representing the position of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string that is a valid substring of `string`, and `start` is an integer representing the index of `substring` in `string`.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string that is a valid substring of `string`, `start` is an integer representing the index of `substring` in `string.**
