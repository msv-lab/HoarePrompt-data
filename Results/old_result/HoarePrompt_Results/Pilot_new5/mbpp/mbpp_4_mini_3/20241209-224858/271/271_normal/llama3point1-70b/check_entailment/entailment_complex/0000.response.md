Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input tuple `tuples` is empty correctly. According to the problem description, if the input is empty, the expected output should be an empty list. However, in the provided code, if `tuples` is empty, the expression `len(tuples)` will be 0, leading to a division by zero error when it tries to calculate the average with `sum(val) / len(tuples)`. 

To summarize, while the program does correctly compute the averages for non-empty tuples, it fails to return an empty list when provided an empty tuple of tuples, which is a specified requirement in the problem description. This makes the program incorrect.
