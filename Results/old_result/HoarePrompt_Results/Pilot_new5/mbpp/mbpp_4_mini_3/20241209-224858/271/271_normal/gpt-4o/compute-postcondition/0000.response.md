The variable `num_elements` is assigned the value of the length of the first inner tuple of `tuples`. The initial state indicates that `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, and each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length. Therefore, `num_elements` will be an integer representing the number of elements in that first inner tuple. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, and each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length; `num_elements` is an integer equal to the length of the first inner tuple of `tuples`.**
