Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from a tuple of tuples. It uses the `zip` function to group the elements at each position across all tuples, then sums those values and divides by the number of tuples to get the average. 

The code handles various potential cases, such as:
- When there are tuples with equal lengths, it properly averages corresponding elements.
- When there is only one tuple, it returns the values of that tuple as averages.
- When tuples are empty, `len(tuples)` would be zero, preventing any division by zero because the input should ideally not contain empty tuples (though the problem description does not specify handling of such cases).

Overall, the implementation matches the problem description, ensuring correctness for any valid input provided to the function.
