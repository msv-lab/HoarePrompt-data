The program provided in `func_1` correctly computes the averages of the corresponding values from each inner tuple in the input tuple of tuples. Let's break down the verification:

1. **Input**: The function accepts a tuple of tuples, which is a valid assumption as stated in the problem description. The program also assumes that each inner tuple has the same length, which is necessary for correctly averaging the values.

2. **Loop through positions**: The program iterates over the indices of the elements in the inner tuples (from 0 to `num_elements - 1`). This is in accordance with the problem description, as it computes the average for each position across all inner tuples.

3. **Collecting elements**: For each index `i`, the program collects all elements at that index across different tuples into the list `elements_at_position`.

4. **Average calculation**: The average is calculated as the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the number of inner tuples, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

5. **Output**: The function returns a list of averages, which aligns perfectly with the expected output format described in the problem.

6. **Assumptions**: The function does not explicitly handle cases where:
   - `tuples` is empty.
   - An inner tuple is empty (which would lead to an index error).
However, these are not specified in the problem description, and since the function assumes at least one inner tuple of the same length, it behaves correctly under the expected usage condition.

Given the assertions provided also pass successfully, it indicates that the function meets the requirements for the test cases provided.

Thus, the function correctly adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
