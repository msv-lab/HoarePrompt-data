The code initializes a set called `months_with_31_days` containing the month numbers that have 31 days. This does not alter the value of the variable `month` in any way, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`month` is an integer representing a month number, such that 1 <= month <= 12; `months_with_31_days` is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}**
