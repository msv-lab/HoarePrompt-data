#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer representing a month number, such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if month is in the set of months_with_31_days {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` (1 through 12) and returns True if the month has 31 days (i.e., if `month` is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12); otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle invalid month values (such as 0 or 13) and assumes that the input is always within the valid range.
