Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(month)` correctly checks if the given month number contains 31 days by using a set of month numbers that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). It returns `True` if the month is in this set and `False` otherwise. The assertions provided in the program include all relevant cases (i.e., months with 31 days, February, and other months) and they all return the expected results, confirming the correctness of the implementation. Since there are no cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, it is considered correct.
