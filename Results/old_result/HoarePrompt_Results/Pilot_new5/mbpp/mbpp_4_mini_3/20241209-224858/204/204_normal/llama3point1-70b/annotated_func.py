#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing a month number between 1 and 12 (inclusive).
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns whether the month number 'n' is in the list of months with 31 days, which includes the months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing a month number between 1 and 12 (inclusive) and returns True if `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December); otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range of 1 to 12, which could lead to unexpected results if the input is invalid.
