Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1(n)` checks if the input month number `n` is present in the list `months_31_days`, which contains the months with 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

Here are the key points confirming the correctness:
- The function returns `True` if the input month number is one of the months contained in the list, indicating that the month has 31 days.
- It returns `False` for all other month numbers (for months with 30 days and February), which is the expected behavior based on the problem description.

Since there are no edge cases or inputs that lead to incorrect behavior, the program meets the requirements as stated in the problem description.
