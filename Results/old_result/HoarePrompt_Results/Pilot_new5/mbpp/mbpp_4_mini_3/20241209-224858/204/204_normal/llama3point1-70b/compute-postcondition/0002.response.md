The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer representing a month number between 1 and 12 (inclusive). After executing the function body, if `n` is in the list of months with 31 days, which includes the months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` representing a month and return `True` if the month has 31 days, or `False` if it does not.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns True if n is a month with 31 days; otherwise, it returns False.**
