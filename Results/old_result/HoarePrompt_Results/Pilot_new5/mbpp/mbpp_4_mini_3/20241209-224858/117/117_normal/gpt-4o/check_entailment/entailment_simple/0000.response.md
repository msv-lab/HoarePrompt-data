Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly implements the requirement of counting the number of integer elements in a given list. Here's how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst)` takes a single parameter, `lst`, which is expected to be a list containing elements of various data types.

2. **Counting Integers**: The function uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function. It iterates over each element `x` in the list `lst` and checks if `x` is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`. For each integer element found, it adds 1 to the total count.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count of integer elements, which fulfills the requirement stated in the problem description.

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases that validate the correctness of the function:
- The first assertion checks a list with mixed types and confirms that the function correctly identifies 2 integers.
- The second assertion checks a list with only integers and confirms that the function correctly identifies all 3 as integers.
- The third assertion includes a list with integers and floats, and it confirms that only the 2 integers are counted, returning the correct count of 2.

Since the function correctly counts and returns the number of integer elements in various cases, it adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
