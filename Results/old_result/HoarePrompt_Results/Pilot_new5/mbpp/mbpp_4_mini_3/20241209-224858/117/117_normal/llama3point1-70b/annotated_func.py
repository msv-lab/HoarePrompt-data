#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that may include integers among other types.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of elements in the list that are of type integer. It does not account for other types or handle any additional logic beyond counting integers.
