Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and checks if it is an instance of the `int` type. The `sum` function then adds up the results of these checks, effectively counting the number of integers. 

To verify its correctness, we can consider various potential cases:

1. An empty list `[]` should return `0`, which is correct since there are no integers.
2. A list with only integers, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, should return `3`, which is also correct.
3. A list with mixed types, e.g., `[1, 'string', 3.5]`, should return `1`, which is correct.
4. A list with no integers, e.g., `['string', 3.5, False]`, should return `0`, which is correct.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly and there are no edge cases that it fails to account for, I conclude that the program is implemented correctly according to the problem description.
