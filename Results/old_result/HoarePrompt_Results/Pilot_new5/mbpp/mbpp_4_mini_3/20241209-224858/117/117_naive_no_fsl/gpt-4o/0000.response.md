Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a list. The use of `isinstance(x, int)` ensures that only elements of type `int` are considered, excluding strings, floats, and any other types. 

The assertions given in the program have been tested against various scenarios:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` returns 2, which correctly counts the integers `1` and `2`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns 3, accurately counting all three integers.
3. `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` returns 2, counting only the integer `1` and `4`, since `1.2` and `5.1` are floats.

Since the function handles these scenarios correctly and there are no edge cases or missing logic identified in the function's implementation, the program is correct.
