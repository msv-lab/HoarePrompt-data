Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to count the number of integer elements in a given list, but it does not handle cases where the list is empty. The assertion tests do not include an empty list, so the function may not be thoroughly validated. For example, calling `func_1([])` would return `0`, which is correct, but there are no tests for negative integers or mixed types that could potentially lead to confusion in understanding the function's coverage. 

In addition, the assertions provided in the program are written before the function definition, meaning they would raise an error when the program is run since `func_1` is not defined at that point. 

The function needs valid test cases to ensure that all potential inputs are covered for correctness. Thus, since it could potentially fail in edge cases and the assertions are incorrectly placed, the correctness is deemed false.
