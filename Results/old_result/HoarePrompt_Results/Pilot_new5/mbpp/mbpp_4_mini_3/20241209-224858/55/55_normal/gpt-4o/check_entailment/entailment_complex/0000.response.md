Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it does not account for the following scenarios:

1. **Leading or Trailing Underscores**: If the input string has leading or trailing underscores, the function would either capitalize an empty string (which does not exist) or produce an incorrect result. For example, `func_1('_snake_case')` would return `SnakeCase`, which is misleading, as the leading underscore indicates there is no preceding word.

2. **Multiple Consecutive Underscores**: If the input string contains multiple consecutive underscores, the function would treat the empty sections between underscores as valid components and capitalize them, resulting in unexpected behavior. For example, `func_1('snake__case')` would yield `SnakeCase`, but it should ideally handle or raise an error for invalid formatting.

3. **Empty Input String**: If the function is called with an empty string `func_1('')`, it would return an empty string, which does not conform to the expectations of a camel case result from a valid snake case input.

Given these potential edge cases that the program does not handle, the function does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description, and thus it is deemed incorrect.
