To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description and consider various potential cases.

The function `func_1` is intended to convert a snake_case string (e.g., `'python_program'`) into a CamelCase string (e.g., `'PythonProgram'`). The implementation does this by splitting the input string on underscores, capitalizing each component, and then joining them together.

Let's review the potential cases:

1. **Basic Cases**:
   - For `func_1('python_program')`, the output is `'PythonProgram'`, which is correct.
   - For `func_1('python_language')`, the output is `'PythonLanguage'`, which is correct.
   - For `func_1('programming_language')`, the output is `'ProgrammingLanguage'`, which is also correct.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty string input: `func_1('')` should ideally return an empty CamelCase string, which it does since splitting an empty string results in a list with a single empty string, and joining it returns an empty string.
   - A single word in snake_case without underscores: `func_1('python')` should return `'Python'`, which it does.
   - A string that starts or ends with underscores: `func_1('_leading_underscore')` should return `'LeadingUnderscore'`, and `func_1('trailing_underscore_')` should return `'TrailingUnderscore'`. The current implementation may produce unexpected results (like an extra leading capitalized character) if not correctly handled.
   - Multiple consecutive underscores: `func_1('python__language')` would result in an additional empty string component, leading to incorrect output (`'PythonLanguage'` instead of the expected `'PythonLanguage'`).

Given these evaluations, particularly regarding how the function handles strings with leading, trailing, and multiple consecutive underscores, we can conclude that there are cases where the program does not work as expected.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False** 

The implementation does not correctly handle cases like strings with leading/trailing underscores or multiple consecutive underscores, which leads to incorrect CamelCase conversion.
