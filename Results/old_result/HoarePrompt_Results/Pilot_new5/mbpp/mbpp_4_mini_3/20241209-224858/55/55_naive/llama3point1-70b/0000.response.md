Correctness: **False**.

The provided function does not handle the case when the input string is empty. According to the problem description, the function should convert a snake case string to a camel case string. However, if an empty string is passed, the function will return an empty string, which is technically valid but does not meet the spirit of converting the string as required. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input could have leading or trailing underscores (e.g., `"_example_string"` or `"example_string_"`) which would also lead to incorrect formatting in camel case. 

For example:
- If the input is an empty string `""`, the output is `""`, which is not a valid camel case string.
- If the input is `"_example_string"`, the output will be `"ExampleString"` instead of a more appropriate handling that could produce an error or a specific format.

This indicates the function does not correctly handle all edge cases.
