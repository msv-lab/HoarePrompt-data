Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `snake_str` consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, splits it into components using underscores, capitalizes each component, and returns a single string that is the concatenation of these capitalized words. Note that the function does not handle any additional edge cases, such as leading or trailing underscores, multiple consecutive underscores, or an empty input string, which may lead to unexpected results like returning an empty string or incorrect capitalization. **
