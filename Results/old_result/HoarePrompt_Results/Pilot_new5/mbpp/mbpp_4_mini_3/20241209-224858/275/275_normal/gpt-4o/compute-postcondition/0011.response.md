The assignment `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]`. The specific value of `dp[i]` will now be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j]` plus one. The initial state indicates that `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list with length equal to `len(nums)`, and `i` is greater than 0, implying that `j` must also be a valid index in `dp`. 

Since `dp[i]` is being updated, we must note that its value will now reflect the maximum between its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`. The values of `nums`, `dp`, and the variable `i` remain unchanged apart from the update to `dp[i]`, which is dependent on the previous state of `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`**.
