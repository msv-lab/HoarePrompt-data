According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is at least 1. Since `i` is already 1, the loop will execute once with `j` taking the value 0 in the first iteration. The state of `nums` and `dp` does not affect whether the loop executes in this specific case.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` filled with 1s, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0**
