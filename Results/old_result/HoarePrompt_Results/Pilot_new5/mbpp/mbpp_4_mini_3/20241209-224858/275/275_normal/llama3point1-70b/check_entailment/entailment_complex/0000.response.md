Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible.

Here is the reasoning for its correctness:

1. **Handling of an Empty List**: The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns 0, which is appropriate since there cannot be any subsets in an empty list. This aligns with the requirement that the function should correctly handle all cases, including an empty input.

2. **Sorting the List**: The function sorts the list `nums`. Sorting is necessary for the subsequent logic to work correctly because it ensures that when we check divisibility, we are always looking at potential "predecessor" elements that are smaller or equal to the current element. This is crucial for building valid subsets.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where each index `i` keeps track of the size of the largest divisible subset ending with `nums[i]`. Initially, every element in `dp` is set to 1, indicating that each number itself can be considered a subset of size 1.

4. **Nested Loop for Divisibility Check**: The nested loop structure effectively checks each pair of numbers (where the outer loop iterates through `nums` starting from index 1 and the inner loop iterates through all previous numbers) to determine if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, the size of the subset ending at `nums[i]` can be potentially increased by considering the size of the subset ending at `nums[j]`.

5. **Max Calculation**: After building the `dp` array by considering all pairs, the function returns the maximum value found in `dp`. This maximum value represents the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible, which directly satisfies the problem's requirement.

In summary, the function correctly implements the logic needed to find the largest divisible subset in a list of integers, adhering to the problem description. Thus, the correctness is affirmed.
