`dp` is assigned a list where each element is initialized to `1`, and the length of this list is equal to the length of `nums`. The state of `nums` remains unchanged, but `dp` now holds a list of integers all set to `1`. If we denote the length of `nums` as `n`, then `dp` is a list with `n` elements, all equal to `1`. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, and `nums` is not empty; `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, with all elements initialized to 1.**
