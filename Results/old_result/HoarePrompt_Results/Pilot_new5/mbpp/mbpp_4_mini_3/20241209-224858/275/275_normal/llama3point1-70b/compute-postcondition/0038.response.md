The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `i`. The value of `dp[j]` is used to calculate the new value for `dp[i]`. Therefore, the impact of this line of code is to potentially increase the value of `dp[i]` depending on the relationship between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Hence, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dp` is a list representing the lengths of the longest divisible subsets, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `i`, and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
