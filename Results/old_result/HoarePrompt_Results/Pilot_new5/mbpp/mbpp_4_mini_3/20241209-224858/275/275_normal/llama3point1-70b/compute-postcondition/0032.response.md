`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it implies that a longer divisible subset can be formed. Therefore, the value of `dp[i]` will be updated based on the maximum of these two calculations. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dp` is a list representing the lengths of the longest divisible subsets, `i` is 2, `len(nums)` is greater than 2, `dp[i]` is updated to max(`dp[i]`, `dp[j] + 1`)**.
