Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` initialized to 1. If `nums` has no elements, then `dp` remains all 1s. If `nums` has elements, `dp[i]` will contain the length of the longest divisible subset ending at index `i`, considering all previous indices `j` where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
