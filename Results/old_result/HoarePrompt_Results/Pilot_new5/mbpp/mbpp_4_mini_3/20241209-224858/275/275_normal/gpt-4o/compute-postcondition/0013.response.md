According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates through a range from `0` to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, which means the current value of `j` at the end of the last iteration is `i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, thus allowing `j` to take on a new value of `i`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should reflect that `i` is now incremented by 1. Since `nums` is still a sorted list of integers and `dp` remains a list of the same length, these do not need to be modified.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, and `i` is greater than 1.**
