Output State: **`dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, for all `i` from 0 to len(nums) - 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by any `nums[j]` where `j < i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` retains its original value.**
