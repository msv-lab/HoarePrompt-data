According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the `nums` list from `0` to `i-1`. Given that `i` is currently equal to `len(nums)`, this means that the loop has already executed for all indices from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must move to the next index.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since the loop is defined to run for `j` in the range of `i`, the next value for `j` would be `1`. 

However, the loop will not execute again because `j` must be less than `i`, and since `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, the maximum value for `j` would not change in its valid range (which is from `0` to `i-1`).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` will be incremented to `1`, but `i` remains equal to `len(nums)`.
- The constraints for the list `nums` should remain the same as it still has enough elements to ensure the loop could execute if `i` were not equal to `len(nums)`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each index, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 1.**
