Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each index, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]` (i.e., `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`).***
