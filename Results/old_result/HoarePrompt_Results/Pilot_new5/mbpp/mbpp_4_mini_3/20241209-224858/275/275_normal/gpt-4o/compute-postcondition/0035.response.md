The code updates the value of `dp[i]` by taking the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. The variable `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 1. Hence, the current value of `dp[j]` refers to `dp[1]`, and `dp[i]` refers to `dp[len(nums)]`. 

The value of `dp[len(nums)]` will either remain the same or be updated to `dp[1] + 1`, depending on which is larger. The other variables (`nums`, `dp`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `len(nums) + 1` elements, `dp` is a list containing the length of the longest divisible subsequence for each index, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 1, and `dp[len(nums)]` is updated to `max(dp[len(nums)], dp[1] + 1)`.**
