Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, with `i` greater than 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
