Output State: **`dp` is a list representing the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i]` reflects the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`. The execution of the loop requires `i` to be at least 1, meaning `len(nums)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.**
