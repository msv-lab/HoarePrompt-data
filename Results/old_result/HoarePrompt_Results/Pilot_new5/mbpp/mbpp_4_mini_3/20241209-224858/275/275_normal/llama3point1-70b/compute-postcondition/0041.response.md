Output State: **`dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` indicates the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, based on the divisibility conditions applied to all previous elements in `nums`. If `len(nums)` is at least 1, `dp` starts as a list of 1s and is updated based on the divisibility relationships between the elements of `nums`.**
