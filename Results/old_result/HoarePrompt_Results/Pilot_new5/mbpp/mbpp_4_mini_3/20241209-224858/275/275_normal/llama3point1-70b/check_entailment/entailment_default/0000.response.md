To assess the program's correctness, let's break down the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair within the subset is divisible. 

**Code Review:**
The function `func_1(nums)` starts by checking if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, which is correct as per the problem description. Next, the function sorts the input list and initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` where each element starts with a value of 1 (since a number can form a subset of at least itself). 

Then, it uses a nested loop to check each pair of numbers in the sorted list. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This approach correctly counts the largest divisible subset up to each number in the sorted array. Finally, it returns the maximum value in `dp`, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

**Edge Cases:**
1. An empty list (already handled, returns 0).
2. A list with all identical numbers (e.g., [2, 2, 2]) should return the length of the list since all pairs are divisible.
3. A list where no two numbers are divisible (e.g., [2, 3, 5]) should return 1 since the largest subset in this case is any single number.

**Output Hints Review:**
The output hints state that the function returns 0 if `nums` is empty and calculates the maximum length of a divisible subset otherwise. This aligns with the logic of the code.

**Conclusion:**
The code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases. I cannot identify any edge cases where the program would fail to satisfy the problem's requirements based on the described functionality.

Thus, the assessment is:

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The implementation correctly handles empty inputs, identifies the longest divisible subset using dynamic programming, and accounts for various potential edge cases correctly as described. Therefore, it meets the requirements set in the problem description.
