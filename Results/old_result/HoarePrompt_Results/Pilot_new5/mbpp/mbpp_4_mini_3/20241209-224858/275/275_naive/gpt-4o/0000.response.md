To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the requirements and the code itself.

**Problem description:** The task is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in that subset is divisible.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)

assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4
```

### Analysis:
1. The program starts by checking if the input list `nums` is empty and returns 0 if true.
2. It sorts the list to ensure that smaller numbers come first, which makes it easier to check divisibility.
3. The `dp` array is initialized to keep track of the size of the largest divisible subset ending at each index.
4. The nested loops iterate through the list to fill in the `dp` array based on the divisibility condition.
5. The maximum value in the `dp` array is returned as the result.

### Potential Cases:
Let's check if there are any potential edge cases or errors in the logic.

- **Case with Non-divisible Elements:** 
   - Consider the input `nums = [3, 5, 7]`. Here, no pair of numbers is divisible by each other.
   - The expected output in this case would be `1` (since the largest subset can only consist of any single element), but based on the logic, it will return `1`.

- **Another case:** 
   - `nums = [1, 2, 4, 8]` should return `4` because all numbers are divisible by `1`, and `2` divides `4` and `8`.
   - The output will be `4` which is correct.

Through analysis, the core logic appears to be correct regarding forming the largest subset based on divisibility, and the assertions provided also seem to validate that the function works correctly for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating, I couldn't find a test case where the function does not operate as intended, given the constraints described.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
