According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i`, which is the length of the `nums` list. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` starts from 0, so before the loop starts, `j` should be initialized to 0.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need the following adjustments:

- `i` must be greater than 0 (indicating that `nums` has at least one element).
- `j` is initialized to 0.

State: **`dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
