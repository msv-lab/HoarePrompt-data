To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and see if it accurately finds the size of the largest subset such that every pair in the subset is divisible.

The assertions given in the problem help us identify a few test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])` should return `4`
2. `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])` should return `3`
3. `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])` should return `4`

### Analysis of the Program:

- The function first checks if the input `nums` is empty, returning `0` if true, which is correct.
- The list is sorted to facilitate the comparison for divisibility.
- An array `dp` is initialized to keep track of the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with each element.
- The nested loops iterate through the list, checking for pairs where one number is divisible by another. If they are divisible, the function updates the `dp` array to reflect the maximum size of subsets found.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` array.

### Testing Edge Cases:

1. **Single Element Case**: 
   - Input: `[5]`
   - Expected Output: `1` (The only subset is the element itself).
   - Actual Output: The program will return `1` since the logic holds true.

2. **All Elements Are the Same**: 
   - Input: `[4, 4, 4, 4]`
   - Expected Output: `4` (All elements can form a subset).
   - Actual Output: The program will return `4`, which is correct.

3. **No Pairs Divisible**: 
   - Input: `[5, 7, 11]`
   - Expected Output: `1` (Each can only form a subset of itself).
   - Actual Output: The program will return `1`, which is correct.

4. **Zero Element**: 
   - Input: `[0, 2, 4, 6]`
   - Expected Output: `4` (0 is divisible by all).
   - Actual Output: The program will return `4`, which is correct.

5. **Mixed Divisibility**:
   - Input: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]`
   - Expected Output: `5` (All elements form a valid subset).
   - Actual Output: The program will return `5`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

After evaluating the function against various test cases, including edge cases, the function consistently provides the expected results according to the problem description. There do not seem to be potential cases where the function fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True** 

The logic is sound, and it successfully handles all identified scenarios as outlined in the problem description.
