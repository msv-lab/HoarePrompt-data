Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two inputs: a sorted list of integers (`sorted_list`) and an integer value (`value`). It uses a for loop to iterate through the elements of `sorted_list` and checks if any element is greater than or equal to `value`. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program satisfies the problem requirements:

1. **Locating the Right Insertion Point**: The function searches through the sorted list to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. This is exactly the requirement of locating the right insertion point in a sorted order.

2. **Return Values**:
   - If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns the index of that element. This is done through the `return i` statement within the loop.
   - If all elements are less than `value`, the loop completes without returning, leading to the return of `len(sorted_list)`, which is the correct behavior as it indicates that the value should be inserted at the end of the list.

3. **Correctness in All Cases**: The program handles all potential cases:
   - If `value` is less than or equal to the smallest element in the sorted list, it correctly returns `0`.
   - If `value` is greater than all elements in the sorted list, it correctly returns `len(sorted_list)`, indicating the insertion should occur at the end.
   - For values that fit in between, it correctly identifies the first index where the value can be inserted in sorted order.

Overall, the implementation adheres to the problem description requirements, and thus, it is correct.
