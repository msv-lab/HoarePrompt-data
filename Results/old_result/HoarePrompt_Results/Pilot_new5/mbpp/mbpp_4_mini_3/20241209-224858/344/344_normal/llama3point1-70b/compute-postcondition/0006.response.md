Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order with at least two integers, `i` is 1, and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`. If `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns 1. If `sorted_list[i]` is less than `value`, the function proceeds without returning a value, while still maintaining the conditions of the precondition.***
