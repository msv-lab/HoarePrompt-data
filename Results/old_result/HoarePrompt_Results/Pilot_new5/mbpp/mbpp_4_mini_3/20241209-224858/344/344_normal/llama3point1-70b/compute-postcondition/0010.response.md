Output State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers in sorted order, `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list`, and if all elements of `sorted_list` are less than `value`, the function does not return anything. If at least one element is greater than or equal to `value`, the function would have returned the index of the first such element, which would be less than `len(sorted_list)`.**
