To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

The function aims to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The expected behavior is that it should return the index at which the `value` should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. The function iterates through each element in `sorted_list`.
2. It checks if the current item in `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to the `value`.
3. If it finds such an element, it returns the current index `i`.
4. If it completes the loop without finding any such element (meaning the `value` is greater than all elements in the list), it returns `len(sorted_list)`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: If `sorted_list` is empty and `value` is, for example, 5, the function should return 0, which it does.
2. **Value is Smaller than All Elements**: If `sorted_list = [10, 20, 30]` and `value = 5`, the function should return 0, which it does.
3. **Value is Larger than All Elements**: If `sorted_list = [10, 20, 30]` and `value = 40`, the function should return 3 (which is `len(sorted_list)`), which it does.
4. **Value Matches an Element**: If `sorted_list = [10, 20, 30]` and `value = 20`, it should return 1, which it does.
5. **Value Between Two Elements**: If `sorted_list = [10, 20, 30]` and `value = 25`, it should return 2, which it does.

### Conclusion:
The function handles all tested cases correctly, including edge cases. It correctly identifies the insertion index for both values less than, greater than, and equal to the values in the sorted list.

Correctness: **True**
