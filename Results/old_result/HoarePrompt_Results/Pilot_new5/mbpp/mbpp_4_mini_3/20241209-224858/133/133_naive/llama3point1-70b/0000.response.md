Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the elements of the first tuple `tup1` by the elements of the second tuple `tup2` at the same index. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples, and the resulting tuple is constructed using a generator expression that computes the difference for each pair.

Since the problem description does not specify any constraints on the size of the tuples, and the function handles tuples of equal length correctly, it will also raise a `ValueError` if the tuples are of different lengths (which is acceptable in Python). Thus, in all potential cases, the function performs correctly according to the problem description.
