Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and subtracts the elements of the first tuple from the corresponding elements of the second tuple. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`), which is the expected input type according to the problem description.

2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The use of `zip(tup1, tup2)` combines the two tuples into pairs of corresponding elements. The generator expression `a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2)` accurately computes the difference between each pair.

3. **Return Type**: The result is returned as a tuple, which aligns with the requirement to return a tuple of differences.

4. **Test Cases**: The program includes assertions that check the correctness of the function against various input cases, confirming that the function works as expected for the provided examples.

Thus, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for all potential cases, ensuring that it will function properly for tuples of the same length containing numerical values.
