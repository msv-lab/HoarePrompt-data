The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of equal length containing numerical values, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are of unequal length, the function will only compute differences for the pairs that exist, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple without raising an error.
