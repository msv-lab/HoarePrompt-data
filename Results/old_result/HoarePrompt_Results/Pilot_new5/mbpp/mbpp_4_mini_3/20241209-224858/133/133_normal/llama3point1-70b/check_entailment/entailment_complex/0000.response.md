Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description in every potential case. While it correctly computes the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2` when they are of equal length, the comment states that it will only compute differences for the pairs that exist if the tuples are of unequal length. This implies that in the case of unequal length tuples, the program will ignore extra elements without raising an error, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

The problem description asks for a function that subtracts elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. However, if the tuples are of unequal length, it is not clear if the function is intended to handle this by ignoring excess elements or if it should raise an error. The lack of handling for this case could lead to unexpected behavior, as the problem description does not specify that ignoring elements is acceptable.

Due to this ambiguity regarding unequal tuple lengths and the lack of proper handling for such cases, the function does not strictly adhere to the problem description. Hence, the correctness is marked as **False**.
