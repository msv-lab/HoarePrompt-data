To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the implementation against the problem description.

The problem requires a function that takes two tuples and subtracts the corresponding elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple. The program is expected to handle various cases, including tuples of different lengths and containing different data types.

Let's evaluate the provided code:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis:

1. The function uses `zip` to pair elements from both tuples. This is a crucial point because `zip` will stop at the shortest tuple, which means if the input tuples are of different lengths, the function won't handle the extra elements in the longer tuple.

2. The function assumes that both tuples contain numeric types since it uses the subtraction operation (`a - b`). If any of the elements are not numbers (e.g., strings or None), the function will raise a `TypeError`.

3. The assertions provided (test cases) do not cover edge cases, such as:
   - Different lengths of tuples (e.g., `func_1((1, 2), (1, 2, 3))`)
   - Non-numeric types (e.g., `func_1(('a', 'b'), ('c', 'd'))`)
   - Empty tuples (e.g., `func_1((), ())`)

### Potential Failures:

- If we call `func_1((1, 2), (1, 2, 3))`, it will return (0, 0) and ignore the `3` from the second tuple, which is not aligned with subtracting all elements.
- A call like `func_1((1, 2), ('a', 3))` will raise a `TypeError` because it tries to subtract a string from an integer.

### Conclusion:

Given these points, the function does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description, specifically:
- It does not properly handle tuples of different lengths.
- It does not safeguard against non-numeric types.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
