Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` uses the XOR operator (`^`) to determine if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The expression `num1 ^ num2` will yield a number where each bit represents whether the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` are the same (0) or different (1). 

The `bin(...).count('1')` part then counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of the result. If the count is equal to 1, it means that `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position, which is exactly what the problem describes.

No cases can be found where the function fails to meet the problem's requirement, as it correctly identifies whether the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position for all possible integer inputs. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
