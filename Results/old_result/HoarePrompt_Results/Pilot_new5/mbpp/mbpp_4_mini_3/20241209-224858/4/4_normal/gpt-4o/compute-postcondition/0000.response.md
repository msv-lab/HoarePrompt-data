`xor_result` is assigned the value of `a ^ b`, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the integers `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `xor_result` is equal to `a ^ b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `xor_result` is equal to `a ^ b**.
