The problem description specifies that the function should check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The code achieves this by calculating the XOR of the two numbers and checking if the result is a non-zero power of 2. 

The XOR operation between two numbers `a` and `b` will yield a value that has a binary representation where each bit position indicates whether the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are the same (`0`) or different (`1`). If the result of `a ^ b` is a power of 2 (i.e., contains exactly one `1` in its binary representation), it indicates that `a` and `b` differ by exactly one bit.

The function checks:
1. `xor_result != 0` ensures that `a` and `b` are not equal (since equal numbers yield an XOR of `0`).
2. `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2 (has only one bit set).

Now, examining edge cases:
1. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function correctly returns `False`, as it should.
2. If `a` and `b` differ by more than one bit, the function will also return `False`, which is correct.

Next, let's consider the output hints. The hints state that the function returns `True` if the result is a non-zero power of 2 and `False` otherwise. The hint also mentions that it does not handle cases where both `a` and `b` are equal, resulting in an XOR of `0`. However, the code logic correctly handles this case by returning `False` when `a` is equal to `b`.

After reviewing the provided hints and confirming that they align with the code's behavior, it appears that the function correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It checks whether the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position for all potential cases, including when both numbers are equal.

Correctness: **True**.
