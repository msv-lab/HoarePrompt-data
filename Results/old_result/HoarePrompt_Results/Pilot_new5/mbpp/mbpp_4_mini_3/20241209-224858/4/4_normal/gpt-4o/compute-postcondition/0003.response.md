Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, computes the XOR of `a` and `b`, and returns `True` if the result is a non-zero power of 2; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, it does not handle cases where both `a` and `b` are equal, resulting in an XOR of 0, which will also return `False` as expected.**
