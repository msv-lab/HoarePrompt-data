Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2`, as input.

2. **Bitwise Comparison**: The expression `num1 ^ num2` computes the bitwise XOR of the two numbers. The XOR operation results in a binary number where the bits are set to `1` wherever the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ. 

3. **Counting Differing Bits**: The `bin(...).count('1')` part counts how many bits differ between the two numbers. If the count is `1`, it means that `num1` and `num2` differ by exactly one bit.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the count of differing bits is exactly one, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. If the count is not one (including the case where both numbers are zero), it returns `False`.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The annotations note that both numbers being zero results in a return value of `False`, which aligns with the requirement that they must differ at one bit position. 

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios, ensuring that it accurately checks for exactly one differing bit position.
