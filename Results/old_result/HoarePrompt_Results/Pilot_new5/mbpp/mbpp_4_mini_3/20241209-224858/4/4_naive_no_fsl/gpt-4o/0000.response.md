To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to assess whether the function `func_1(a, b)` accurately checks if two integers differ at exactly one bit position.

The function uses the XOR operator (`^`) to compare the two numbers. The expression `a ^ b` gives a number where the bits are set to 1 only where `a` and `b` differ. 

The logic used in the return statement:
```python
return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0
```
is as follows:
1. `xor_result != 0`: This checks that `a` and `b` are not the same.
2. `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`: This checks if there is exactly one bit set in `xor_result`. If `xor_result` has only one bit set to 1, then `xor_result` is a power of two, and this condition will be true.

Now let's evaluate the assertions made in the code:
- `func_1(13, 9)` (binary: `1101` vs `1001`) differs at one bit position (result: `True`).
- `func_1(15, 8)` (binary: `1111` vs `1000`) differs at multiple bit positions (result: `False`).
- `func_1(2, 4)` (binary: `0010` vs `0100`) differs at multiple bit positions (result: `False`).
- `func_1(2, 3)` (binary: `0010` vs `0011`) differs at one bit position (result: `True`).
- `func_1(5, 1)` (binary: `0101` vs `0001`) differs at two bit positions (result: `False`).
- `func_1(1, 5)` should yield the same result as `func_1(5, 1)`, which is `False`.

By examining the assertions and the function's logic, it is evident that the function fails for the test case `func_1(5, 1)`, which is expected to return `True` (as they differ at only one bit position), but logically it returns `False` because it counts two differing bits.

Since there is at least one case where the program does not do what the description says (for `func_1(5, 1)`), we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
