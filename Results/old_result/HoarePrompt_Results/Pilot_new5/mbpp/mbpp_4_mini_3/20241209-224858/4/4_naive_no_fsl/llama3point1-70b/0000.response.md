To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem Description:** 
The task is to write a function that checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
```

**Analysis:**
1. The expression `num1 ^ num2` computes the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`. The result will have a `1` in each bit position where the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.
2. The function then converts this result to a binary string with `bin(...)`, and counts the number of `1`s in that string using `.count('1')`.
3. If the count of `1`s is equal to `1`, it means that `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position.

**Edge Case Analysis:**
- If `num1` and `num2` are equal (e.g., `num1 = 5`, `num2 = 5`), the result of `num1 ^ num2` is `0` (binary `0`), which contains no `1`s. The function will return `False`, as expected.
- If `num1` and `num2` differ at more than one bit position (e.g., `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 6`), the result of `num1 ^ num2` is `3` (binary `11`), which contains two `1`s. The function will return `False`, as expected.
- If `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position (e.g., `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 7`), the result of `num1 ^ num2` is `2` (binary `10`), which contains exactly one `1`. The function will return `True`, as expected.

**Test Cases:**
- `func_1(5, 5)` → `False` (same number, no differing bits)
- `func_1(5, 6)` → `False` (differs at two positions)
- `func_1(5, 7)` → `True` (differs at one position)

Since the program handles all these cases correctly, I cannot find any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly identifies whether the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position based on the logic of the XOR operation and counting the number of `1`s in the resulting binary representation.
