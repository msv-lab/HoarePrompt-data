Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly counts the occurrences of the specified element in the tuple using the built-in `count()` method of the tuple, which is designed to handle this task effectively. It will return the correct count for any element provided, including scenarios with duplicates, edge cases such as an empty tuple, or an element not present in the tuple. Since no inputs or potential cases can be identified where this implementation fails to meet the problem description, it is considered correct.
