Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and it uses the `count` method of the tuple to return the number of occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. 

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a tuple and an element, which aligns with the problem requirements.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The use of `tup.count(elem)` directly counts how many times `elem` appears in `tup`, which is the primary task described.
3. **Data Types**: The function can handle `elem` of any data type, since tuples in Python can contain elements of mixed types.

Since the function performs the action of counting occurrences as specified and adheres to the input types described, it correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
