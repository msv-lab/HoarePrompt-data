Correctness: **False**

The annotated program is incorrect because it contains a logical inconsistency regarding the preconditions and its handling of the input. Specifically, the function is guaranteed to receive a list (`nums`) with at least two distinct integers. However, the program includes a check that returns `None` if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2, which contradicts the stated precondition. While the precondition asserts that `nums` will always have at least two distinct elements, the presence of this check introduces the possibility of returning `None` under circumstances that should not occur according to the problem description.

In summary, the program does not consistently adhere to the requirements of the problem description, as it includes code that handles a scenario (returning `None`) that should never happen based on the guarantees provided. Hence, it fails to meet the correctness requirements established by the problem statement.
