Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and, if there are at least two distinct integers, returns the second smallest unique integer from `nums`. However, if there are not at least two distinct integers, it returns None. Since the precondition states that `nums` contains at least two distinct elements, this condition should not occur in normal use; hence, the function's behavior regarding returning None may not be relevant based on the input guarantee.**
