Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list of numbers. Here's why it works correctly for various cases:

1. **Removing Duplicates**: The use of `set(nums)` ensures that all duplicate numbers are removed from the input list, which is essential for finding the second smallest unique number.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the list has fewer than two unique numbers (e.g., an empty list, a list with one number, or a list with all identical numbers), the function returns `None`, which is an appropriate response when there is no second smallest number.

3. **Sorting**: After removing duplicates, the `sorted()` function is used to sort the unique numbers, allowing for straightforward access to the second smallest number by indexing with `[1]`.

The function appears robust and handles potential edge cases effectively, thus fulfilling the problem description's requirements.
