#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that there is no value to return despite 'nums' being a list of integers with at least two distinct elements. This suggests that 'unique_nums', which contains unique integers derived from 'nums', has a length that is not sufficient to meet the condition of having at least two unique integers.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`. The length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `unique_nums`, which is derived from the distinct elements in `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and, if there are at least two distinct integers, returns the second smallest unique integer from `nums`. However, if there are not at least two distinct integers, it returns None. Since the precondition states that `nums` contains at least two distinct elements, this condition should not occur in normal use; hence, the function's behavior regarding returning None may not be relevant based on the input guarantee.
