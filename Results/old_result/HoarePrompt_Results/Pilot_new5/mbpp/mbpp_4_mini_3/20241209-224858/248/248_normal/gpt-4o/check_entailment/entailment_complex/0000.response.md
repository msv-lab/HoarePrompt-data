Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1(lst)` takes a list `lst` as an input and returns a tuple containing the same elements. This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement to convert a list to a tuple.

Hereâ€™s why the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input and Output**: The function accepts an input of type list, which is expected, and outputs a tuple as specified.
2. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided in the program check that the function returns the correct tuple for various lists. All assertions should pass, indicating that the function behaves as required.
3. **Empty List Handling**: If the input is an empty list, the function will return an empty tuple, which is also acceptable behavior according to the problem description.
4. **No Type Restrictions**: The problem description does not impose restrictions on the elements of the list, and the function appropriately converts any list to a tuple regardless of its content.

Overall, since the function performs the required operation of converting a list to a tuple correctly, we can confidently conclude that the implementation meets the described needs.
