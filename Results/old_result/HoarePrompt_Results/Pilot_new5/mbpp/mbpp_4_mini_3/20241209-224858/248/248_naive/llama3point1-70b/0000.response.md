Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function, which accurately handles all potential cases, including lists of varying sizes, empty lists, and lists containing elements of any data type. Since no edge cases or potential failure cases can be identified, the code meets the requirements of the problem description.
