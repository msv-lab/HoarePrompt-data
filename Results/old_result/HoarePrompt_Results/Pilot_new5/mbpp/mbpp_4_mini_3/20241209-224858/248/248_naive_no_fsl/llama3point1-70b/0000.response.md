Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts a list to a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor in Python. It handles all potential cases, including:

1. An empty list: `func_1([])` will return an empty tuple `()`.
2. A list with integers: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` will return the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`.
3. A list with mixed data types: `func_1([1, "two", 3.0])` will return the tuple `(1, "two", 3.0)`.
4. A list with nested lists: `func_1([[1], [2]])` will return the tuple `([1], [2])`.

Since the function works as expected for all these cases, it adheres to the problem description, and there are no edge cases where it fails to convert a list to a tuple. Thus, the program is correct.
