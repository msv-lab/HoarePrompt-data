Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly according to the formula for the volume of a prism, which is the area of the base times the height (or length in this context). 

The base area of the triangular base is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

The volume of the prism is then calculated as:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{length} \]

The assertions provided as test cases confirm that the function behaves correctly for those specific inputs. 

1. For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`:
   - Base area = 0.5 * 10 * 8 = 40
   - Volume = 40 * 6 = 240 (Correct)

2. For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`:
   - Base area = 0.5 * 3 * 2 = 3
   - Volume = 3 * 2 = 6 (Correct)

3. For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`:
   - Base area = 0.5 * 1 * 2 = 1
   - Volume = 1 * 1 = 1 (Correct)

No edge cases, such as negative values or zero dimensions, are addressed in the problem description nor the function's behavior. However, since no specific constraints were given in the problem, and the function does return correct volumes for the provided test cases, we can conclude that the logic is correct for the inputs tested.

Thus, I am confident that the function is correct as it adheres to the expected behavior for the given problem description.
