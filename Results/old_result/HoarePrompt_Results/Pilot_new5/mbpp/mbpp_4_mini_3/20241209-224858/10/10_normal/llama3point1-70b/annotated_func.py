#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive float representing the base of the triangular prism, h is a positive float representing the height of the triangle, and l is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as (base 'b' multiplied by height 'h' divided by 2) multiplied by length 'l'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive float parameters: `b` (the base of the triangular prism), `h` (the height of the triangle), and `l` (the length of the prism). It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula (base `b` multiplied by height `h` divided by 2, multiplied by length `l`). There are no validation checks for non-positive values, which could lead to incorrect volume calculations if negative or zero values are passed.
