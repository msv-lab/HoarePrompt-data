Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to calculate the volume of a triangular prism based on the given problem description. 

Here's how the function works in accordance with the requirements:

1. **Understanding the Volume Calculation**: The volume of a triangular prism is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
   \]
   where the Base Area of the triangular cross-section can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
   \]
   Thus, combining these formulas, we have:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}\right) \times \text{Length}
   \]

2. **Function Implementation**: In the provided function `func_1(base, height, length)`, the first operation calculates the base area using the formula for the area of a triangle. The second operation calculates the volume by multiplying the base area by the length of the prism. This implementation accurately reflects the mathematical principles governing the volume of a triangular prism.

3. **Assertions for Testing**: The assertions included in the program verify that the function produces the expected output for given inputs. Each assertion checks a different case, and all the outputs are as expected, confirming that the function behaves correctly across multiple scenarios.

Overall, the function compiles the correct mathematical steps and satisfies the problem description of finding the volume of a triangular prism. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
