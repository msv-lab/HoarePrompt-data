Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `b` (the base of the triangle), `h` (the height of the triangle), and `l` (the length of the prism), all of which are specified to be positive floats.

The formula used in the program to compute the volume is:

\[
\text{Volume} = \left(\frac{b \times h}{2}\right) \times l
\]

This formula accurately represents the volume of a triangular prism, as the area of the triangle is given by \(\frac{b \times h}{2}\) and multiplying this area by the length \(l\) gives the volume of the prism.

Although the program lacks validation checks for non-positive values, the problem description specifies that all inputs are positive floats. Therefore, under the assumptions given in the problem description, the function will always produce the correct volume result.

In summary, since the function adheres to the problem's requirements and correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
