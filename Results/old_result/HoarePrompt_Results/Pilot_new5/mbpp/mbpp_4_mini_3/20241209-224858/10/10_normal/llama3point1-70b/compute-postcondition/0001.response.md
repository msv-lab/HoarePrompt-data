The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. All three parameters are positive floats, where `b` represents the base of the triangular prism, `h` represents the height of the triangle, and `l` represents the length of the prism. The function calculates the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((b \times h / 2) \times l\), and returns this volume. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three positive float parameters representing the dimensions of a triangular prism and return the calculated volume of that prism.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: b (base of the triangular prism), h (height of the triangle), and l (length of the prism), and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as (base 'b' multiplied by height 'h' divided by 2) multiplied by length 'l'.**
