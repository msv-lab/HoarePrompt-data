Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns a list of even numbers from the input list of numbers. 

Here's why the code is correct in every case:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list.
2. It checks if each number is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0`.
3. If the condition is true, the number is included in the resulting list of even numbers.
4. The provided assertions validate the function with various inputs, including:
   - A list containing both even and odd numbers.
   - A list that includes zero and larger numbers.
   - A list with only even numbers.

Since the function successfully handles these cases and adheres to the problem description of finding even numbers from a list, it is deemed correct. There are no identified edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail.
