Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which asks for a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, all of which are expected to be lists of integers.

2. **Combining Lists**: Inside the function, the three lists are combined using the `+` operator, which concatenates the lists into one single list called `combined_list`.

3. **Sorting**: The combined list is then sorted using the built-in `sorted()` function, which returns a new list containing all the elements from `combined_list` in ascending order.

4. **Return Value**: The sorted list is returned as the output of the function.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function behaves correctly even if one or more of the input lists are empty. In such cases, the function will simply return a sorted empty list, which is the expected outcome.

6. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests that verify the correctness of the function against various cases, including duplicates and varied numerical ranges.

In conclusion, the function correctly handles merging and sorting three lists of integers, adhering to the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
