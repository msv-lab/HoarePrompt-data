The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. All three parameters are lists of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns a sorted list that combines the integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers and return a sorted list containing all the integers from these lists combined.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted list that is the combination of integers from list1, list2, and list3.**
