Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not by fulfilling the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s the explanation:

1. The function `func_1` takes an integer input `month`, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 12, inclusive, as stated in the precondition.

2. The list `thirty_days_months` contains the month numbers that have 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

3. The program checks if the input `month` is present in the `thirty_days_months` list using the expression `month in thirty_days_months`.

4. If `month` is one of the months that has 30 days, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

5. The implementation accurately reflects the problem description by specifically checking for the months that have 30 days and correctly identifying all others (including February, which has 28 or 29 days, and the months with 31 days) as not having 30 days.

Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements in all cases, making it correct.
