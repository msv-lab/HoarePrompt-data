The code defines a set `months_with_30_days` containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which represent the months (April, June, September, and November) that have 30 days. The initial state specifies that `month` is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive, but this variable is not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state includes the new set while retaining the state of the `month` variable.

Output State: **`month` is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive; `months_with_30_days` is {4, 6, 9, 11}.**
