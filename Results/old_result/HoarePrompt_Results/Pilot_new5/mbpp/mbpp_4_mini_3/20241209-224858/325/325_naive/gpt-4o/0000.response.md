Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case of month number 2 (February). In the problem description, it states that the function should check whether the given month contains 30 days. However, February has 28 or 29 days (in leap years), and thus it should return False. The program's logic only checks for the months that specifically have 30 days (April, June, September, and November). 

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle invalid month inputs (like 0 or 13), which could also lead to incorrect results. For example:
- For input `0`, the program would incorrectly return `False` since 0 is not a valid month.
- For input `13`, the program would also return `False`, which is incorrect as that is outside the valid range of months.

Thus, there are cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
