Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. Specifically, the assertions made do not match the expected behavior of the function based on the problem description. 

For instance:
- The function `func_1` should return `True` for the month of April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), as these months indeed have 30 days. 
- The function should return `False` for January (1), February (2), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), as these months have either 31 days or, in the case of February, typically 28 or 29 days depending on the year.

The assertion `assert func_1(12) == False` is incorrect because December has 31 days, so the expected output should be `True` for December. This reflects that the code fails to handle the case for December, thus making the overall implementation incorrect.
