The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are numbers, which can be either integers or floats. After executing the function body, it returns the phase of the complex number that is represented by `complex(real, imag)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two numbers, `real` and `imag`, and return the phase of the complex number formed by these two components. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `real` and `imag`, which are numbers (integers or floats), and returns the phase of the complex number represented by complex(real, imag).**
