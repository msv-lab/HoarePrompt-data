The variable `complex_number` is assigned the value of `complex(real, imag)`, which creates a complex number made up of the `real` part and the `imag` part. The values of `real` and `imag` are not affected by this operation, but the new variable `complex_number` is created. The output will reflect that `complex_number` is now a complex number represented by its components.

Output State: **`real` is a number (integer or float), `imag` is a number (integer or float), `complex_number` is a complex number represented by `complex(real, imag)`**
