The program description states that the function should accept two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively, and return the phase (angle) of that complex number in radians. 

Looking at the provided code:

```python
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
```

This code creates a complex number from the real and imaginary parts and correctly returns its phase using the `cmath.phase` function. The assertions provided also test the function with various valid inputs, confirming that it works as expected for these cases.

However, we need to consider edge cases. The phase of a complex number is undefined for the complex number (0 + 0j). If both `real` and `imag` are zero, the output should be considered undefined or could raise an error. The code does not handle this scenario, which is a potential failure case.

The output hints specify that the function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which can be either integers or floats, and accurately describes the functionality of creating a complex number and returning its phase.

In conclusion, while the code works correctly for the provided test cases, it fails to handle the edge case of a complex number that is equal to 0 (0 + 0j), which makes the implementation incomplete with respect to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the complex number is (0 + 0j), which results in an undefined phase.
