Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It then constructs a complex number using Python's built-in `complex()` function and calculates the angle (or phase) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function.

Here's why the program always meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two floating-point numbers as input, which are valid representations for the real and imaginary components of a complex number.
  
2. **Complex Number Construction**: The line `complex_num = complex(real, imag)` correctly constructs a complex number from the provided real and imaginary parts.

3. **Angle Calculation**: The `cmath.phase(complex_num)` function computes the angle (or phase) of the complex number in radians, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

4. **Output**: The function returns the calculated angle, satisfying the requirement to "get the angle of a complex number."

Thus, the program correctly adheres to the problem description and will return the appropriate angle for any valid inputs provided.
