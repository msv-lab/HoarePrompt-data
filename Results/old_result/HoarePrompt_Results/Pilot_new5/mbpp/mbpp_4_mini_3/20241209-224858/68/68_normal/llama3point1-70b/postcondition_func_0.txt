The function accepts two floating-point parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It returns the phase (or angle) of the complex number computed as `real + imag * 1j`, using the `cmath.phase` function. The function does not handle cases where the input parameters are non-numeric types, as this could raise a `TypeError` during execution.
