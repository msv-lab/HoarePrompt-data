#State of the program right berfore the function call: strings is a tuple of strings.
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
    #The program returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple 'strings'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, it will result in an `IndexError` when trying to access the last character. The function does not handle this edge case.
