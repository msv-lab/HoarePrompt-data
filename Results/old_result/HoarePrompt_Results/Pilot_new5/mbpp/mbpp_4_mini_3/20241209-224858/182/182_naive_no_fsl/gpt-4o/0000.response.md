Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple, as specified in the problem description. The provided assertions also validate that the function behaves as expected for various input cases:

1. For the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, it correctly returns `['s', 'r', 's']`.
2. For the input `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, it correctly returns `['e', 'r', 'e']`.
3. For the input `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, it correctly returns `['a', 't', 'o']`.

The program handles typical cases well, and there are no exceptions or errors for varying string lengths in the inputs. 

However, it's worth noting that if an empty string is included in the tuple, such as in the input `('', 'test', 'example')`, it would raise an `IndexError` because there is no last character to access in the empty string. This case is not handled, which indicates that the program is not robust for all potential input cases, which makes it incorrect.

Revising the assessment based on this edge case:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle cases where the strings in the tuple might be empty, leading to potential errors.
