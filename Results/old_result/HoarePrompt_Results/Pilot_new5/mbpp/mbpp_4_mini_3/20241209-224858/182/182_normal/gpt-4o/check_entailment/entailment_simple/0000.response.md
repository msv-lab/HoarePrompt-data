Correctness: **True**

The program correctly extracts the last character of each string from the given tuple, which aligns with the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Type**: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of strings, as specified in the problem description. This is confirmed by the test assertions provided.

2. **Output Type**: The function returns a list containing the last character of each string. This matches the requirement to extract the "rear index element" of each string.

3. **Implementation**: The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and retrieves the last character using indexing `s[-1]`. This is an efficient and straightforward way to achieve the desired result.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs. Each assertion checks the function against specific tuples and confirms that the output is as expected.

Since the function consistently extracts the last character from each string in the tuple as required by the problem description, we conclude that the implementation is correct.
