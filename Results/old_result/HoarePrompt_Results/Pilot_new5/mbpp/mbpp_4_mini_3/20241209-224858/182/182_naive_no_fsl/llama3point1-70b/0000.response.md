Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to extract the last character (rear index element) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension iterates through each string in the input tuple `strings` and retrieves the last character using `s[-1]`.

Key considerations:
- The program handles non-empty strings correctly by accessing the last character.
- If the input tuple contains an empty string, an `IndexError` will occur when trying to access the last character of that empty string (i.e., `''[-1]` will raise an exception).
- However, the problem description does not specify how to handle empty strings, so this could be seen as an oversight in the requirements.

Despite the potential issue with empty strings, since no concrete case was defined in the problem description regarding their presence, one can argue that the program is correct based on the given requirements. It works as intended for non-empty strings, which is the primary focus of the task.

Thus, without specific guidance on handling empty strings, the program is deemed correct for the implicit assumption that all strings will be non-empty.
