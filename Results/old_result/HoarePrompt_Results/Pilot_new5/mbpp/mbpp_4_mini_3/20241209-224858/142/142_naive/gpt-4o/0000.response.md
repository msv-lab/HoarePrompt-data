Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. It iterates through each item in the list `lst` and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that does not match the `element`. If it completes the loop without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`. 

The provided assertions validate the function against various test cases, including:
- A list with distinct elements compared to the given element (returns `False`).
- A list of numbers compared to a number not in the list (returns `False`).
- A list where all elements match the given element (returns `True`).

No additional edge cases are present in the logic that would cause the function to fail for valid inputs, and it behaves as expected according to the problem description for various scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
