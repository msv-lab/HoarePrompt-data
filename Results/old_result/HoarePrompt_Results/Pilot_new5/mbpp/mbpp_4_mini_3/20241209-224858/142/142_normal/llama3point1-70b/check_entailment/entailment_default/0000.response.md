The provided program is designed to check whether all items in a list are equal to a specified element. 

### Initial Assessment
Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all((item == element for item in lst))
```
The `all()` function checks if all elements in the generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` are `True`. This means that if every item in `lst` is equal to `element`, it will return `True`. If any item is not equal, it returns `False`. If `lst` is empty, `all()` returns `True`, which aligns with the description that states "if `lst` is empty, it also returns True".

### Edge Cases
1. When `lst` is an empty list: The function correctly returns `True` because there are no items to compare. This case is handled correctly.
2. When `lst` contains only one element: The function should return `True` if that element matches `element`, and `False` otherwise. This case is also handled correctly.
3. When `lst` contains multiple elements: The function will return `False` if any single item does not equal `element`, which is also correct.

### Output Hints Review
The output hints state:
- The function returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`.
- If `lst` is empty, it also returns `True`.
- It returns `False` if at least one item in `lst` is not equal to `element`.

The output hints match the intended functionality described in the problem statement. There are no conflicting statements, and the hints actually confirm the behavior of the code.

### Conclusion
Since the function `func_1` correctly handles all described scenarios in the problem statement and the output hints align with the code's logic, I conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
