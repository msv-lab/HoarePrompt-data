Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through the list `lst`, and checks if each `item` is equal to the `element`. If it finds an item that is not equal, it returns `False`. If it successfully checks all items and finds them all equal to the element, it returns `True`. 

The provided assertions confirm the function's correctness for several test cases:
1. It correctly identifies that not all items in `['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white']` are equal to `'blue'`, returning `False`.
2. It correctly identifies that not all items in `[1, 2, 3, 4]` are equal to `7`, returning `False`.
3. It correctly identifies that all items in `['green', 'green', 'green', 'green']` are equal to `'green'`, returning `True`.

The function handles empty lists as well â€” in such a case, it would return `True`, which aligns with the typical expectation that all elements in an empty list can be considered equal to any given element (or that there are no elements to contradict this).

Since no edge cases or inputs have been identified that would cause the function to return an incorrect result, the program is correct.
