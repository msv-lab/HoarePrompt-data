Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst, element)` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. It uses the built-in `all()` function along with a generator expression that iterates through each item in the list and compares it to the specified element.

Hereâ€™s why it is correct:
1. If the list is empty, `all()` returns `True`, which aligns with the expectation that 'all items' in an empty list are equal to any element (vacuously true).
2. For non-empty lists, the function checks each item, and if all items match the `element`, it returns `True`. If any item does not match, it returns `False`.

Therefore, there are no edge cases or scenarios where this implementation would fail to meet the problem description.
