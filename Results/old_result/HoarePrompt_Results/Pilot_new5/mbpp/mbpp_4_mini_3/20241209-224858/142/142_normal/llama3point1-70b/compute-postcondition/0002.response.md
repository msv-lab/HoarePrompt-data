Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It returns True if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`; if `lst` is empty, it also returns True (since all zero items can be considered equal to `element`), and returns False if at least one item in `lst` is not equal to `element.**
