You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value that can be of any type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all items in the list 'lst' are equal to the value of 'element', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`. It returns True if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`; if `lst` is empty, it also returns True (since all zero items can be considered equal to `element`), and returns False if at least one item in `lst` is not equal to `element.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
