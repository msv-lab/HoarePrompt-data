The function accepts a list `lst` and a value `element`. It checks if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`. If any element is not equal, it returns `False`. If `lst` is empty, the function returns `True` since there are no elements that contradict the condition. Therefore, the function effectively checks for uniformity in `lst` regarding `element`.
