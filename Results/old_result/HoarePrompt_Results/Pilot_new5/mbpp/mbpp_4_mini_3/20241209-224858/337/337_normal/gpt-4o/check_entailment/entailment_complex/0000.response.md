Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem specifically asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` uses `set(lst)` which computes the sum of all unique integers in the list, including those that appear more than once. 

To illustrate the discrepancy with a concrete example:
- For the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the expected sum of non-repeated elements (elements that appear exactly once) is `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`, but the function returns `21` since it sums the unique values `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` which results in `21`.

Thus, the function incorrectly computes the sum instead of adhering to the requirement of summing only those elements that are **not repeated** in the list. Therefore, the code does not satisfy the problem description.
