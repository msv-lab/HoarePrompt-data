Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description which specifies that the function should find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The function `func_1` currently computes the sum of unique elements in the list by converting the list to a set and summing its elements.

This is incorrect because "non-repeated elements" implies that only elements that appear exactly once in the list should be included in the sum. The use of `set(lst)` collects all unique elements regardless of their frequency, which does not satisfy the requirement of summing only those elements that occur exactly once.

For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the element `1` is repeated and should not be included in the sum. Therefore, the correct result should be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`, but the function would return `21` as it includes the `1` as a unique element when it should not.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality as stipulated in the problem description.
