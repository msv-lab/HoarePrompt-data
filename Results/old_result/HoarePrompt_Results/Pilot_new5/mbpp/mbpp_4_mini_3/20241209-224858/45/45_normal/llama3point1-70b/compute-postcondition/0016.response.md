The value of `undulating` is assigned `False`. The states of the other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `i` is `len(n) - 1`, and `undulating` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `i` is `len(n) - 1`, `undulating` is `False`**.
