Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits. If the current character `n[0]` is less than `n[1]` and `n[1]` is less than `n[2]`, or `n[0]` is greater than `n[1]` and `n[1]` is greater than `n[2]`, then `undulating` remains True. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
