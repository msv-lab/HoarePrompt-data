Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits. If the digit at position `i` is either greater than both its neighbors or less than both its neighbors, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
