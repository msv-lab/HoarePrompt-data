`s` is assigned the value of `str(n)`, which converts the positive integer `n` into its string representation. The initial state of `n` remains a positive integer, and the only new variable introduced is `s`, which now contains the string value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`**
