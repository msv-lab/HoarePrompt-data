To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's first analyze the provided information.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to check if a given number is undulating, meaning that it alternates between two different digits.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True
```

### Output Hints:
The function should:
1. Return `False` if the string representation of `n` has less than 3 digits.
2. Return `False` if the first two digits are the same.
3. For strings with 3 or more digits, it must ensure that characters at even indices match the first digit and characters at odd indices match the second digit. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function checks the length of the number correctly and returns `False` for numbers with less than 3 digits.
2. It checks if the first two digits are the same and returns `False` if they are.
3. It iterates through the number to ensure that the even indices match the first digit and the odd indices match the second digit.

### Edge Cases:
- Numbers with exactly 3 digits should be checked. For example, `121` should return `True` as it alternates correctly.
- Numbers with identical digits at even and odd positions should return `False`. For instance, `222` should return `False`.
- The function will not correctly handle cases with more than two distinct digits, such as `123`, which should return `False`.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints state that the function correctly handles the cases mentioned above. However, they do not highlight the fact that a number with more than two unique digits should also return `False`, nor do they indicate that if the first two digits are the same, it should return `False`.

### Conclusion:
The function does appear to handle the basic undulating number check as described. However, it does not address cases where the number has more than two unique digits, which could lead to incorrect results for inputs that do not fit the exact alternating pattern of just two digits.

Thus, since the program does not cover all potential edge cases described in the problem description, particularly regarding more than two unique digits, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
