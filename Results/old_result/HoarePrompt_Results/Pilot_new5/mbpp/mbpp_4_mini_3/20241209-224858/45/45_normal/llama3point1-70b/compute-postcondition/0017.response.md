The code contains a `break` statement, which exits the nearest enclosing loop or if statement. Since there are no variables being modified or assigned new values in this case, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the fact that we exited the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 2 digits, `i` is `len(n) - 1`, `undulating` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
