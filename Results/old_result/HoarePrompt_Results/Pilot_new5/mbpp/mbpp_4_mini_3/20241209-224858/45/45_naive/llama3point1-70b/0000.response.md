To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both:

**Problem Description:**
The task is to check whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number typically alternates between increasing and decreasing values, meaning that each digit must either be greater than or less than the next digit in a manner that consistently alternates.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Conversion:** The input number `n` is converted to a string to facilitate digit comparison.
2. **Looping and Conditions:** The loop iterates from the second digit to the second-to-last digit, checking if the digits are either increasing or decreasing:
   - The condition checks whether the current digit is part of a sequence where itâ€™s either:
     - Greater than both its neighbors or
     - Less than both its neighbors.
3. **Undulating Logic:** The variable `undulating` is set to `False` if it finds a digit that doesn't fit the undulating criteria.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:** 
   - The code does not handle cases where the number has fewer than 3 digits correctly. For example:
     - For a single-digit number (e.g., `5`), or a two-digit number (e.g., `23`), the function would incorrectly return `True` because there are not enough digits to violate the undulating condition. 
   - The function returns `True` for numbers like `11` or `22`, which do not undulate.
- **Logic Flaw:** 
   - The program does not correctly check the required alternating conditions. Only checking if both neighbors are greater or lesser is insufficient to determine if it undulates, as it should alternate.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
- For input `121`, the expected output is `True` because it undulates.
- For input `22`, the expected output is `False` because it does not undulate, but the program will return `True`.

### Conclusion:
Given the presence of these issues and the fact that the program does not handle all potential cases according to the problem description, we deem it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
