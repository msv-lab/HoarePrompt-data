Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes an array and an element, checks if the element is present in the array, and returns a tuple. The first item in the tuple indicates whether the element is found (True or False), and the second item indicates the index of the element or -1 if it is not found. 

The use of the `try` and `except` block effectively handles the case where the element is not found in the array, raising a `ValueError`, which is caught and results in returning (False, -1). 

The function handles all relevant cases:
1. If the element is present in the array, it returns True and the index.
2. If the element is not present in the array, it correctly returns False and -1.

No edge cases or potential failures are apparent, as the function adheres to the problem's requirements for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
