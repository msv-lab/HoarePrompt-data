The provided program defines a function `func_1`, which takes an array and an element as input. It attempts to find the index of the element in the array and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is present, along with the index of the element or -1 if it is not found.

Initially assessing the code against the problem description, it appears that the function meets the requirements: it returns `(True, index)` if the element is found and `(False, -1)` if the element is not present in the array. 

However, upon closer examination, there is an edge case that the code does not explicitly handle: if the `array` is empty, the method `array.index(element)` would raise a `ValueError`, which is caught by the exception handling, returning `(False, -1)`. This behavior is correct and aligns with the problem description. 

Now, checking the output hints, they state that the function handles cases where the `element` is not present by utilizing exception handling for `ValueError`, which is indeed accurate. The hints also confirm the expected returns when the element is either found or not found.

Considering all cases:
1. If the array is empty, it correctly returns `(False, -1)`.
2. If the element is present, it returns `(True, index)`.
3. If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases based on the problem description and the output hints, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
