The program provided in the annotated code attempts to fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list) and `element` (to be searched within the list).
2. **Loop through Elements**: It uses a for loop with `enumerate` to iterate through the elements of `arr`, allowing access to both the index and value of each element.
3. **Element Comparison**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current `value` is equal to the `element`. If a match is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, which is correct behavior as specified in the problem description.
4. **Return Statement**: If the loop completes without finding the `element`, it returns `(False, -1)`, which correctly indicates that the element is not in the array.

### Verification Against the Problem Description
- The function returns a boolean indicating the presence of the element in the array (`True` if found, `False` if not).
- It also returns the index of the element if found, or `-1` if not found.
- It handles all edge cases, such as:
  - An empty array (will return `(False, -1)`).
  - An element that is at the beginning, middle, or end of the list.
  - Cases where the element is not present.

Given the analysis above, the function adheres to the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**

The function meets the problem requirements by correctly returning whether the element is present and its index, or indicating absence properly.
