The value of `index` is assigned the result of `array.index(element)`, which returns the first index at which `element` is found in `array`. The specific value of `index` depends on the contents of `array` and the presence of `element`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `array` is a list of elements, `element` is an item that is comparable to the elements in the array, and `index` is the index of `element` in `array` (if `element` is present). 

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, `element` is an item that is comparable to the elements in the array, and `index` is the index of `element` in `array` (if `element` is present).**
