The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. The parameter `arr` is a list of elements, and `element` can be of any type that is comparable with the elements in `arr`. 

Upon executing the function, the following cases can occur:
- Case 1: If the first element of `arr` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and the current index, which is 0.
- Case 2: If the second element of `arr` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and the index, which is 1.
- Case 3: If the third element of `arr` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and the index value, which is 2.
- Case 4: If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `False` and -1, indicating that the element is not present in the array.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of elements `arr` and a comparable `element`, returning the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`, or indicating if `element` is not present. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and a comparable `element`, returning `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`, or `False` and -1 if `element` is not present in `arr`.**
