Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `index()` method to find the position of the specified element in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it raises a `ValueError`, which is caught in the `except` block, returning a tuple with `False` and -1. 

This implementation handles all potential cases:
1. When the element is present in the array, it returns `True` and the correct index.
2. When the element is not present, it returns `False` and -1.

No edge cases are missed, and the logic aligns perfectly with the problem description.
