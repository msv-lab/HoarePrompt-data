The function accepts a list `array` and an `element` of any type that is comparable to the elements in the list. It returns `True` and the index of `element` if it is found in `array`; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`. The function handles cases where the `element` is not present by using exception handling for `ValueError`.
