Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `array` (a list of elements) and `element` (which can be of any type comparable to the elements in the array).

2. **Checking for Element Presence**: The program uses the `index()` method of the list, which attempts to find the index of `element` in `array`. If `element` is found, `index()` returns the index, and the program returns a tuple `(True, index)`.

3. **Handling Absence of Element**: In case `element` is not found in `array`, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError`. The program appropriately catches this exception in the `except` block. It then returns `(False, -1)`, indicating that the `element` is not present in the `array`.

4. **Return Values**: The function's return values align perfectly with the problem description: it returns a boolean indicating presence (`True` for found, `False` for not found) and the appropriate index (or -1 if not found).

5. **Complete Coverage of Cases**: The program addresses all potential cases specified in the problem description: whether the element is present or absent in the array.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description as stated and correctly implements the required functionality.
