The program does not meet the problem description. The task requires a function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). However, the provided function `func_1(n)` simply returns \( 2^{(n - 1)} \), which does not represent the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

To explain further, the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for \( n \) would involve calculating terms from the binomial expansion \( (1 + 1)^n \) and specifically summing the coefficients at the even indices, which does not equate to \( 2^{(n - 1)} \).

For example:
- For \( n = 4 \), the binomial coefficients are \( 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 \). The even-index coefficients are \( 1, 6, 1 \), and their sum is \( 8 \). 
- For \( n = 6 \), the even-index coefficients are \( 1, 6, 15, 20, 6, 1 \), with a sum of \( 32 \).
- For \( n = 2 \), the even-index coefficients are \( 1, 2, 1 \), giving a sum of \( 2 \).

While the function returns the expected values for the provided test cases, it does not accurately implement the required logic to compute the sum of the even index binomial coefficients in a general sense.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
