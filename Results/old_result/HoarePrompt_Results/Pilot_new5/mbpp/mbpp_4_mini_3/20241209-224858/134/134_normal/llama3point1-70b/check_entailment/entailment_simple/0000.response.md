Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it does what is asked:

1. **Input Parameter**: The function `func_1(n)` takes a single positive integer `n`, which aligns with the requirement that it should take a positive integer.

2. **Iterating Through Binomial Coefficients**: The for loop iterates from `0` to `n` (inclusive), which allows the program to consider all possible binomial coefficients `C(n, i)` where `i` can take all integer values from `0` to `n`.

3. **Even Index Check**: The condition `if i % 2 == 0` ensures that only the binomial coefficients corresponding to even indices are summed. This is directly in line with the requirement to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

4. **Sum Calculation**: The line `sum += math.comb(n, i)` correctly accumulates the binomial coefficients for those even indices. The use of `math.comb(n, i)` accurately computes the binomial coefficient `C(n, i)`.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the total sum of the even index binomial coefficients. This output directly corresponds to the requirement stated in the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`, ensuring that it meets the problem's requirements.
