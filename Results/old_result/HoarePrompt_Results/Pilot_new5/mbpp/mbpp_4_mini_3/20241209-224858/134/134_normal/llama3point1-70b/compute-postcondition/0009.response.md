To determine the output state, we will analyze the effect of the code snippet on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer 
- `sum` is 1 
- `i` is 2 

The code `sum += math.comb(n, i)` computes the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)`, which is defined as \( C(n, i) = \frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!} \). Given that `i` is 2, the operation calculates \( C(n, 2) \).

We know:
- `sum` starts at 1.
- The value of `math.comb(n, 2)` will be a non-negative integer because `n` is a positive integer.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `sum` will be updated to \( 1 + C(n, 2) \).

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `sum`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to `1 + math.comb(n, 2)`, `i` is 2**
