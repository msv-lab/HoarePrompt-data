The value of `sum` is updated by adding the value of `math.comb(n, i)` to it. The function `math.comb(n, i)` calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 1, `math.comb(n, 1)` evaluates to `n`, since the number of ways to choose 1 item from `n` items is simply `n`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` becomes `1 + n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. So the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `sum` is `1 + n`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is `1 + n`, `i` is 1**
