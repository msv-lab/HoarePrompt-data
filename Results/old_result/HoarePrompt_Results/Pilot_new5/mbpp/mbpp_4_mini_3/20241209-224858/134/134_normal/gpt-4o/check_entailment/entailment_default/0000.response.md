To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to evaluate both the code and the hints provided.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

### Code:
```python
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`. This is a mathematical expression that may relate to the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given `n`. The binomial coefficient for even indices can be thought of in terms of combinatorial mathematics, but summing these coefficients does not directly yield `2 ** (n - 1)` for all values of `n`.

2. **Expected Outputs**: The assertions suggest that:
   - For `n = 4`, the expected output is `8`, which matches `2 ** (4 - 1) = 2 ** 3 = 8`.
   - For `n = 6`, the expected output is `32`, which matches `2 ** (6 - 1) = 2 ** 5 = 32`.
   - For `n = 2`, the expected output is `2`, which matches `2 ** (2 - 1) = 2 ** 1 = 2`.

### Edge Cases:
The code does not explicitly handle cases where `n` might be equal to 1 or less than 1. However, the problem description specifies that the input will always be a positive integer, thus `n` should be at least 1.

### Output Hints Evaluation:
The output hints state that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `2` raised to the power of `(n - 1)`. It also mentions that it does not handle cases where `n` could be less than or equal to zero. However, since the constraints imply that `n` will always be positive, we shouldnâ€™t encounter this issue based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the code correctly computes `2 ** (n - 1)` for valid positive integers `n`, and it aligns with the problem description as it satisfies the necessary assertions. There is no identified edge case where the code fails given the constraints. 

Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
