#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1). It does not handle cases where `n` might be less than or equal to zero, which would mathematically result in invalid outcomes, but as per the given constraints, it is implied that `n` will always be a positive integer.
