According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` taking values from 0 to `n` (inclusive). Since `n` is a positive integer, this guarantees that the loop will run at least once. Before the loop starts, `sum` is initialized to 0, which does not interfere with the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute properly, we only need to know the values of `i` and `n`.

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0, and it will increment in each iteration until it reaches `n`. Thus, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
