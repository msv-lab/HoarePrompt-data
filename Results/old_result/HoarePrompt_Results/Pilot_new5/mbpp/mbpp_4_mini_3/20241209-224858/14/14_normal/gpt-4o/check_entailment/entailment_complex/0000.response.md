Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which states that the function must determine whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`arr`) as input, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Duplicate Check Logic**: The program uses a set named `seen` to track numbers that have already been encountered in the array. This is a valid approach to check for duplicates since sets inherently do not allow duplicate values.

3. **Loop and Condition**: 
   - The program iterates over each number in `arr`.
   - If a number is found in the `seen` set (indicating it has already been encountered), the function returns `True`, which is the expected behavior when a duplicate is found.
   - If a number is not found in `seen`, it is added to the set.

4. **Return Value**: After checking all numbers, if no duplicates are found, the function returns `False`, indicating that all integers in `arr` are unique, which is also in accordance with the problem description.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program correctly validate the functionality of `func_1` against various test cases, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for different scenarios (no duplicates and with duplicates).

Overall, the function's logic matches the requirements specified in the problem description, ensuring that it will correctly identify whether there are duplicate integers in the provided list.
