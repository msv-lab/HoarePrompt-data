Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement from the problem description to determine if there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers. 

Here's why the program always meets the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(arr)` takes a list of integers as input. It checks whether there are any duplicate integers in this list.

2. **Set Conversion**: The key part of the implementation is converting the list `arr` to a set using `set(arr)`. In Python, a set automatically removes any duplicate elements. Therefore, if the original list `arr` has duplicates, its length will be greater than the length of the set.

3. **Length Comparison**: The function compares the length of the original list with the length of the set. If they are not equal (`len(arr) != len(set(arr))`), it indicates that there are duplicates in the list, and the function returns `True`. If they are equal, it returns `False`, indicating that there are no duplicates.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with one element correctly, as both would return `False` since there are no duplicates in these cases.

Thus, the implementation consistently fulfills the functionality described in the problem, correctly identifying the presence of duplicate integers in the list.
