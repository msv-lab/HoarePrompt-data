Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly address the problem description of determining whether an array contains any duplicate elements. The function `func_1` returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are not, which is the opposite of what the problem description implies. 

For example, consider the input `arr = [1, 2, 3]`. This input has no duplicates, so the expected output is `False`. However, the function would return `True`, indicating duplicates are present, which is incorrect. 

Thus, the function fails on this input case, demonstrating that it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
