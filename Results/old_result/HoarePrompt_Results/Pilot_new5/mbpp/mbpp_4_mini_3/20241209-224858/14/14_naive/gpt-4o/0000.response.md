Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers. It uses a set to keep track of the numbers that have been seen as it iterates through the array. If a number is found in the set, it means that the number is a duplicate, and it returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`. 

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. There are no edge cases or missing logic in the implementation, as it handles all scenarios appropriately, including:
- An array with distinct integers.
- An array with at least one duplicate.
- An array with multiple duplicates.

Hence, the function meets the problem description requirements in all potential cases.
