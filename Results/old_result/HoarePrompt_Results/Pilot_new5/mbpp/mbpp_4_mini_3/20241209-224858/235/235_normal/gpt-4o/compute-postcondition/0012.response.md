The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The program returns the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`. If the value of `n` is 0, the total sum of the digits is also 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the sum of its digits, which is 0 if `n` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a non-negative integer, and returns the sum of its digits, which is 0 if n is 0.**
