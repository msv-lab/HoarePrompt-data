Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input is `0`. According to the problem description, the function needs to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The sum of the digits of `0` should be `0`, but the current implementation does not account for this specific input in the assertions provided. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem description states that the function should compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. This includes `0`, which is a valid non-negative integer.
2. The assertions in the program do not check for the input of `0`. If `func_1(0)` were called, the function would return `0`, which is correct, but the lack of an assertion for this case means the function's behavior for this input is not verified.
3. If we consider the assertion checks, they do not cover all edge cases for non-negative integers, namely the smallest non-negative integer, `0`.

To correct the function, the assertion should include a test case for when `n` is `0`, such as `assert func_1(0) == 0`. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description in a comprehensive manner, as it effectively neglects to test the behavior for all possible inputs, including `0`.
