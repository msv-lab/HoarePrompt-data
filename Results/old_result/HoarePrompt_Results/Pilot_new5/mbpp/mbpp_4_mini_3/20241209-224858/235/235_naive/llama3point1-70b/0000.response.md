Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts it back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. 

For any non-negative integer input (including edge cases like 0), the function will produce the correct sum of its digits. For example:
- For input `123`, the output will be `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
- For input `0`, the output will be `0`.
- For input `9876`, the output will be `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30`.

Since there are no cases where the program fails to meet the problem requirements, the program is deemed correct.
