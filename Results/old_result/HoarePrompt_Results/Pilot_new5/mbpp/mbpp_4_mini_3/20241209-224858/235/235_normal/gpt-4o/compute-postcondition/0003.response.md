The value of `n` is modified by performing integer division by 10. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the result of `n //= 10` will decrease the value of `n` while keeping it non-negative. The variable `total` remains unchanged as it is derived from the original value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now equal to `n // 10` (an integer value greater than or equal to 0), and `total` is still equal to `n % 10` (which reflects the value from before the modification of `n`).

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `total` is equal to `n % 10`, and `n` is now equal to `n // 10`.**
