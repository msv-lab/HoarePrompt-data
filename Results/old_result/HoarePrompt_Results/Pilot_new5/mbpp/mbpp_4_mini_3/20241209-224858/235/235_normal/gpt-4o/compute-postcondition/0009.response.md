After executing the code, `n` is updated to `n // 10`, which means `n` is now equal to the integer division of its previous value by 10. The `total` variable remains unchanged since its value was not affected by the code.

The initial condition stated that `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, which ensures that after applying integer division by 10, `n` will still be a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1 (since `n` is now `n // 10`), and `total` is increased by `n % 10`.**
