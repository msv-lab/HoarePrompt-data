The function accepts a list of numeric values (either integers or floats), rounds each value in the list, calculates the sum of these rounded values, and returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty, which would lead to a multiplication by zero, resulting in a return value of zero.
