To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze both components.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to round every number in a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. 

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a list of numerical values (either integers or floats) and returns the product of the sum of these values rounded to the nearest integer and the count of elements in the list. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, as the sum will be 0 and the count will be 0.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code rounds each number correctly using the built-in `round()` function.
2. It calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers.
3. It multiplies this sum by the length of the input list to generate the final result.

### Edge Cases:
1. If the input list is empty, the function would currently try to compute `len(numbers)` which would be 0, leading to a multiplication of the total sum (which would be 0 since there are no elements) by 0. This scenario would return 0 as expected, which agrees with the output hints.
2. The case of negative numbers would also be handled correctly since rounding logic applies equally to positive and negative numbers.

### Checking the Output Hints:
The output hints state the function should return a product of the sum of rounded values and the count of elements. This aligns with the implementation of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the problem description, program code, and output hintsâ€”there are no apparent edge cases or deviations from the expected behavior in the code. The function correctly handles all specified cases, including the empty list scenario.

Thus, we conclude that the function is correct based on the provided description and hints.

Correctness: **True**.
