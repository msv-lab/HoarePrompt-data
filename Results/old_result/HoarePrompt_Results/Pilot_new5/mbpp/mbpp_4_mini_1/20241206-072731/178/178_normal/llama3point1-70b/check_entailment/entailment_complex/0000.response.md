Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description due to the lack of handling for an empty input list. According to the problem description, the function should round every number in the list and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. However, if the input list is empty, the function would return zero as it would calculate `len(numbers)` to be zero, leading to a multiplication that yields zero. 

This behavior contradicts the expectation that the function should handle cases where the input list contains numbers, as the problem does not specify what to do in the case of an empty list. Ideally, the program should either return an error, a specific value, or a defined behavior indicating that there are no numbers to process.

Thus, while the program does correctly round the numbers and calculate the product when the list is non-empty, it fails to define behavior for all potential inputs as required by the problem description.
