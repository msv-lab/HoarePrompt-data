The code provided is intended to round every number in a given list, calculate the sum of those rounded numbers, and then multiply that sum by the length of the list. 

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
```

1. The initial assessment shows that the code correctly follows the problem description for non-empty lists. It rounds each number, sums them, and multiplies by the list length.

2. However, the potential edge case arises when the input list is empty. If `numbers` is empty, `len(numbers)` would be `0`, and thus the function would return `0` (since the product of any sum with `0` is `0`). The problem states that the function should handle every case, including the empty list case.

Now, considering the output hints:
- The hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the input list is empty, which would lead to a multiplication by zero, resulting in a return value of zero. This confirms that the function lacks a proper check for an empty list.

Conclusion:
Since the code does not follow the problem description correctly in every potential case (specifically, it does not handle the case of an empty list), the correctness of the program is therefore:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle empty lists, leading to a return value of zero, which may not be the intended behavior when the input list is empty.
