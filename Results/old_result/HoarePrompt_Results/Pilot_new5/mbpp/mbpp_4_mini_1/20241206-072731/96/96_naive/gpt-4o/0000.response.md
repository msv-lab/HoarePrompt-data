Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It first checks if the tuple is empty and returns `True` in that case, which is appropriate since there are no differing types in an empty tuple. Then, it stores the type of the first element and iterates through all elements in the tuple, comparing each element's type to the first. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any discrepancies, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions also cover various cases:
- A tuple of integers returns `True`.
- A tuple of integers and a string returns `False`.
- Another tuple of integers returns `True`.

All potential cases appear to be handled correctly, confirming the correctness of the function as per the problem description.
