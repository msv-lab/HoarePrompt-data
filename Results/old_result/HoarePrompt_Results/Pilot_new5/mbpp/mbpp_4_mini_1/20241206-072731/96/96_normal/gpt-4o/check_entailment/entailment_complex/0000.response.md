Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type.

### Explanation:
1. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1(tup)` checks if the input `tup` is a tuple containing elements of any data type.
   - If the tuple is empty, the function returns `True`, which aligns with a common convention that an empty collection can be considered to have "all the same type" since there are no elements to contradict this.
   - If `tup` is not empty, the function stores the type of the first element in `first_type`.
   - It then iterates through each element in the tuple and compares its type to `first_type`. If any element has a different type, the function returns `False`.
   - If all elements have the same type as the first element, the function returns `True`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The function passes all the provided assertions:
     - For the tuple `(5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)`, all elements are of type `int`, so it returns `True`.
     - For the tuple `(1, 2, '4')`, there are both `int` and `str` types, so it returns `False`.
     - For the tuple `(3, 2, 1, 4, 5)`, all elements are again of type `int`, returning `True`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is a reasonable and accepted outcome for the problem described.

Overall, the function fulfills the requirement of checking if all elements in the tuple have the same data type, thus confirming its correctness in accordance with the problem description.
