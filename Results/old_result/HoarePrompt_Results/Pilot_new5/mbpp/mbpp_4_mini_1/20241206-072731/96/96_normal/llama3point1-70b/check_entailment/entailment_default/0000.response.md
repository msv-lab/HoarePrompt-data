To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem description**: The function is supposed to check if all elements in the tuple have the same data type.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1
```

### Initial assessment:
The function creates a set of the types of all elements in the tuple and checks if the length of that set is 1. If the length is 1, that means all elements in the tuple are of the same type; otherwise, they are not. The approach seems straightforward and correct for tuples with multiple elements. However, we need to consider edge cases, particularly when handling an empty tuple.

1. **Edge case - Empty Tuple**: The function does not explicitly handle the case of an empty tuple. An empty tuple does not have any differing types, and thus the function, as written, would return `True`. This result can be seen as reasonable, as there are no types to compare. However, whether this aligns with the problem specification is a point of consideration.
   
2. **Single Element Tuple**: For a single-element tuple, the function should return `True`, as there is only one data type present.

### Output hints:
According to the output hints, the function returns `True` for an empty tuple, which aligns with our assessment so far. It states that the function does not handle edge cases such as an empty tuple but seems to conclude that it returns `True`, which is acceptable.

### Conclusion:
- The function behaves correctly for the cases of single-element and multi-element tuples.
- The function may not explicitly handle the empty tuple scenario; however, it still returns a result that could be considered reasonable given the context.
  
Despite this reasoning, the problem description could imply that an empty tuple should either be considered a special case or should return `False`. Given the ambiguity around how to treat an empty tuple and the lack of explicit handling for it, we can rule that the function does not strictly adhere to the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation**: The program does not handle the empty tuple scenario in a way that might be expected based on typical interpretations of such problems. While it returns `True` for an empty tuple, the lack of explicit handling for this case suggests a potential misunderstanding of the requirements, leading to the conclusion that it does not meet the problem description comprehensively.
