Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly checks whether all elements in the given tuple have the same data type. It uses a set to store the types of elements in the tuple, and if the length of that set is 1, it means all elements are of the same type. The logic handles all cases, including empty tuples and tuples with mixed data types. Since I could not find any case where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
