Correctness: **False**.

The provided program only finds the first occurrence of the substring in the string and returns its position. However, the problem description asks for finding all occurrences and positions of the substrings within the string, not just the first one. 

For instance, if the input is:

```python
func_1("hello hello", "hello")
```

The expected output should include both occurrences of "hello". However, the program will only return:

```python
("hello", 0, 4)
```

This indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, as it fails to find and return multiple occurrences of the substring.
