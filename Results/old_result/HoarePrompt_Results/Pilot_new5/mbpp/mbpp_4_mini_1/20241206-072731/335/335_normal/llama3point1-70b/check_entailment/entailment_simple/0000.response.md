Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function must find the occurrences and positions of substrings within a string. However, the program only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its position. It does not handle cases where the substring may appear more than once in the string. Additionally, it only returns information about the first occurrence and does not return multiple occurrences if they exist.

For example, if the input string is "hello world, hello again" and the substring is "hello", the program would only return the position of the first "hello" and ignore the second occurrence. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirement to find all occurrences and their positions, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
