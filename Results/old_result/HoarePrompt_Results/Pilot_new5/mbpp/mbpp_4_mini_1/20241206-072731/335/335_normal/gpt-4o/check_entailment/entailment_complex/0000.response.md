Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, the problem requires the function to find all occurrences of the substring within the main string and return their positions. However, the implementation only finds the first occurrence of the substring and does not account for multiple occurrences. 

For example, in the input string `'python programming, python language'` with the substring `'python'`, the program returns the first occurrence at index 0, which is correct. However, if the substring appears multiple times, such as in the string `'python programming python python'`, the function does not return all positions or occurrences, which is necessary according to the description.

Moreover, the program does not handle cases where the substring appears multiple times in a string; it only returns the first occurrence. The problem description implies that all occurrences and their respective positions should be returned as well, not just the first one.

Thus, the failure to account for multiple occurrences renders the program incorrect based on the problem description.
