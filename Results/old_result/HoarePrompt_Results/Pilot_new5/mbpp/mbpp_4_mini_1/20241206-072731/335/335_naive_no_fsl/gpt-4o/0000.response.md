To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we'll go through the logic step by step and analyze potential edge cases based on the problem description. 

### Problem Description:
The task is to create a function that identifies the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string. If the substring is not found, the function should return `None`.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)

# Test cases
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality Check**: The function uses `str.find()` to locate the substring. If the substring is found, it calculates the starting and ending positions correctly and returns them in the specified format. If not found, it returns `None`.

2. **Test Cases**: The test cases provided cover various scenarios:
   - Finding a substring at the start of the string.
   - Finding a substring in the middle of the string.
   - Finding a substring at the end of the string.
   - Not finding a substring at all.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - What if `sub_string` is an empty string? The function should ideally return `None` because an empty substring's presence in any string might be ambiguous.
   - What if `main_string` is an empty string? In this case, given any non-empty `sub_string`, the function should return `None`.
   - What if both `main_string` and `sub_string` are empty? The expected handling of this case is also not clear from the description.

### Conclusion:
The provided code fails to handle the cases where either `main_string` or `sub_string` is empty. For example, calling `func_1('', 'python')` would return `None`, which is expected, but `func_1('python', '')` would return `('', 0, 0)`, which is not aligned with the requirement to return `None` if there is no match.

Therefore, since there are cases where the function does not behave as described in the problem statement (especially with empty strings), the overall correctness of the program can be judged as:

Correctness: **False** 

This conclusion is based on the presence of edge cases that the implementation does not adequately address.
