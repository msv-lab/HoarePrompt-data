Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Although the function is designed to check if a number is undulating (defined as having digits that alternate between increasing and decreasing), it fails to handle cases where the input number is less than 100 properly. 

Here are the issues:

1. **Assumption about Input:** The function assumes that the input number `n` is always at least 100. However, this assumption is not checked within the function. If a number less than 100 is passed, the function may not behave as intended, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Logic for Undulating Checking:** The logic in the loop may not correctly identify undulating patterns for all valid cases. For example, the current condition checks for a strictly increasing or decreasing pattern, but an undulating number could also have equal adjacent digits which would not be considered by the logic. The undulating condition should be that the digits increase and decrease alternately, but the implementation lacks the proper handling of this requirement.

3. **Return Value for Edge Cases:** If `n` is less than 100 (like 99 or 50), the function will convert it to a string and execute the loop. However, since the loop starts at index 1 and goes to `len(n) - 1`, it might not evaluate any digits if the length of `n` is less than 3, which could also lead to returning `True` incorrectly.

Due to these issues, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential input cases. Therefore, the correctness verdict is **False**.
