To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the implementation:

**Problem description:** Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts an integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if its length is at least 3. If the length is less than 3, it returns False. If the first two digits of the string representation of `n` are the same, it also returns False. For strings of length 3 or more, it checks if characters at even indices are equal to the first character and characters at odd indices are equal to the second character. If all of these conditions are satisfied, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where `n` is negative or zero, meaning it assumes positive integers only.

### Initial Assessment:

The code checks if a number is "undulating" by ensuring:
1. The number has at least 3 digits.
2. The first two digits are different.
3. It alternates between the first and second digits.

### Edge Cases:
1. The function does not handle negative numbers or zero. If `n` is negative, it will be converted to a string, but the logic does not consider the negative sign.
2. If `n` is a single-digit or two-digit number, it returns False, which aligns with the problem statement.
3. It assumes positive integers, which might not be explicitly stated in the problem description.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints confirm the logic of the program, stating that the function checks for length and digit alternation as expected. However, they also mention that the function does not handle negative numbers or zero, which is a significant edge case that the program overlooks.

### Conclusion:
The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically for negative numbers and potentially zero. Since it overlooks cases where the input might be invalid (negative numbers), it does not meet the requirements of the problem description completely.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle negative integers correctly, which is a valid case based on the integer inputs that could be provided. Thus, it does not correctly determine undulating numbers for all scenarios as required by the problem description.
