The value of `undulating` is assigned to `False`, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `undulating` is now `False`, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer represented as a string that is at least "100" and has a length of at least 4, `i` is 3; `undulating` is False.**
