The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer represented as a string that is at least "100" and has a length of at least 4; `i` is 3; `undulating` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
