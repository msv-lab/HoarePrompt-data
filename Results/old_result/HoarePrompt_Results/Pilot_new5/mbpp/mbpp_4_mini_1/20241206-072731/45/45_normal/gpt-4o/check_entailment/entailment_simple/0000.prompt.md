You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the value of n is represented as a string s with a length of less than 3.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is 3 or more.
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the condition being checked is not met.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is 3 or more, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and the value of `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`.
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string of length equal to or greater than 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, all even indexed characters of `s` are equal to `first_digit`, and all odd indexed characters of `s` are equal to `second_digit`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the conditions regarding the string `s` are satisfied, where all even indexed characters are equal to `first_digit` and all odd indexed characters are equal to `second_digit`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
