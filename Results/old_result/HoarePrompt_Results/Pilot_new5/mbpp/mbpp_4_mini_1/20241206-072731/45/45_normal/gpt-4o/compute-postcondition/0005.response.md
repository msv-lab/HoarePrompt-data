The variable `second_digit` is assigned the value of the second character in the string `s`, which represents the second digit of the integer `n`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `first_digit` remain unchanged, but now `second_digit` holds a specific character from `s`. Given that the length of `s` is 3 or more, `second_digit` is guaranteed to be valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is 3 or more, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, and `second_digit` is the second character of `s`.**
