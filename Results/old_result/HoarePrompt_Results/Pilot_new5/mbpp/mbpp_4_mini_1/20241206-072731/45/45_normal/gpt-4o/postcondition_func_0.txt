The function accepts an integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if its length is at least 3. If the length is less than 3, it returns False. If the first two digits of the string representation of `n` are the same, it also returns False. For strings of length 3 or more, it checks if characters at even indices are equal to the first character and characters at odd indices are equal to the second character. If all of these conditions are satisfied, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where `n` is negative or zero, meaning it assumes positive integers only.
