The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. Given the problem description, the expected behavior of the function is to output `(b, a)` for inputs `a` and `b`.

1. **Initial Assessment**: 
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns `(b, a)`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description that states it should return the second number followed by the first number.
   - There are no conditions or modifications involved; it simply takes two inputs and returns them in reversed order.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Since the function simply returns the inputs without any additional logic, there are no edge cases that need to be handled. Any two numbers passed to the function will be returned in the correct order.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints confirm that the function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing `b` and `a`. This is consistent with the implementation of `func_1`. 
   - The hints also mention that there are no edge cases to consider, which is in line with the behavior of the function.

Since the function behaves as intended according to the problem description and the output hints agree with the code, there are no potential cases where the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly returns a tuple of the second input followed by the first input for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or special scenarios that would cause it to behave incorrectly.
