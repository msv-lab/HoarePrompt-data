Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number (`b`) followed by the first number (`a`). 

The assertions in the code confirm that the function behaves as expected in various test cases:
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which corresponds to the input values.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`.

In each case, the output matches the required format of returning the second number first and then the first number, confirming that the function adheres to the problem description.

Thus, the implementation meets the requirements set forth in the problem description for all potential cases.
