The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. 

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters, `a` and `b`. This aligns with the problem description which specifies that the function must take in two numbers.

2. **Return Statement**: The return statement in the function returns a tuple `(b, a)`. This is exactly what the problem description requires: the function must return a tuple with the second number (`b`) first and the first number (`a`) second.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code test the function with different inputs (10, 20), (15, 17), and (100, 200). In each case, the function correctly returns the tuple in the expected order, confirming that it behaves as specified for these examples.

4. **General Case**: The comments clarify that the function simply swaps the order of the inputs, and there are no edge cases to consider, which is consistent with the problem description.

The function operates correctly for all potential cases as it is simply returning the inputs in a defined order. Therefore, it adheres to the problem description without any issues.

Correctness: **True**
