The provided program aims to convert degrees to radians, which aligns with the problem description. The formula used in the function `func_1(deg)` is correct, as it multiplies the degree value by Ï€ and divides by 180 to convert degrees to radians.

However, I need to consider potential edge cases. The function does not handle cases where `deg` is not a numeric type. If a user inputs a string or any non-numeric type, the function will raise a `TypeError`. This is a critical oversight since the problem description does not specify that the input will always be a numeric value.

The output hints indicate that the function accepts a numeric value and returns the equivalent angle in radians, but also mention that it does not handle cases where `deg` is not a numeric type. 

Thus, the function does not follow the problem description for all potential cases, particularly with respect to non-numeric inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the input is not a numeric type, which would lead to an error instead of returning a proper output.
