Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle negative input values. For example, if we pass -90 to the function `func_1`, it will return -1.5707963267948966, which is not a valid conversion of degrees to radians in the context of the problem description, as it does not specify how to handle negative angles. The correct behavior for converting degrees to radians should still yield a valid output for any real number input, including negative numbers.
