Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the input `deg` is not a numeric type. According to the problem description, the function should convert degrees to radians, which implies that it should accept valid numeric inputs. However, there is a lack of input validation in the code. If the function receives a non-numeric value (like a string or None), it would raise a TypeError instead of providing a meaningful output or handling the error gracefully. This behavior does not align with the expected functionality as outlined in the problem description, which implies that the function should be robust and able to process a variety of inputs.
