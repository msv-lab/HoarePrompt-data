#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns deg multiplied by π and divided by 180, converting the angle in degrees to radians.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns the equivalent angle in radians by multiplying `deg` by π and dividing by 180. It does not handle cases where `deg` is not a numeric type.
