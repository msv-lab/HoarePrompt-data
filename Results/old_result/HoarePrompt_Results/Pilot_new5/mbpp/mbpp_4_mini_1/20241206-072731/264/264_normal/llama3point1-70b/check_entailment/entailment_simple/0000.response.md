Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description: it converts an angle in degrees to radians. 

Here's why it is correct:
1. **Input**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `deg`, which is specified to be a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. This aligns with the requirement to convert degrees.
  
2. **Conversion Formula**: The formula used in the function, `deg * math.pi / 180`, is the standard mathematical conversion from degrees to radians. This is derived from the fact that 180 degrees is equal to π radians. Thus, multiplying the degree value by π and then dividing by 180 effectively performs the conversion.

3. **Output**: The function returns the result of the conversion, which is a numeric value in radians. This meets the requirement of the problem description to perform the conversion.

Since the function adheres to the specified requirements and correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
