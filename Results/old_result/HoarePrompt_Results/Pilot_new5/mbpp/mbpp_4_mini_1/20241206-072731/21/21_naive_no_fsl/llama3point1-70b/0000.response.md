Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. The `min()` function will raise a `ValueError` if called on an empty list. According to the problem description, the function should find the smallest number in a list, and for an empty list, there is no smallest number, which the program fails to account for. Thus, the program is incorrect.
