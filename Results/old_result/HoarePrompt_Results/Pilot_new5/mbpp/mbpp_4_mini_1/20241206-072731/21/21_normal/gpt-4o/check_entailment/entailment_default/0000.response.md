To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python function against the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code.

### Problem description:
The task is to write a function that finds the smallest number in a list.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
```

### Output hints:
The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the minimum value from that list. However, if the list is empty, it will raise a ValueError since there would be no minimum value to return.

### Initial Assessment:
The provided function uses the built-in `min()` function, which correctly returns the smallest value in a list. However, the problem description does not mention how the function should behave when an empty list is passed. The hint states that a ValueError will be raised when the list is empty, which is true because the `min()` function does not handle empty lists and raises an error instead.

### Edge Cases:
1. An empty list `[]`: This will raise a ValueError, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description. Thus, this case is not handled correctly.
2. A list with one element `[5]`: This will correctly return that single element, which is expected.
3. A list with negative numbers `[-1, -5, -10]`: The function will correctly return `-10`, which is valid.

### Checking Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function will raise a ValueError if the list is empty. This aligns with the behavior of the `min()` function, confirming that the function will indeed raise an error for an empty list.

### Conclusion:
The problem description does not adequately cover the case of an empty list, and since the function raises a ValueError for that input, it does not meet the requirement of finding the smallest number in a list for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case of an empty list correctly, as it raises a ValueError which is not accounted for in the problem description. This omission makes the function incorrect according to the requirements.
