#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of numbers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'lst' of numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the minimum value from that list. However, if the list is empty, it will raise a ValueError since there would be no minimum value to return.
