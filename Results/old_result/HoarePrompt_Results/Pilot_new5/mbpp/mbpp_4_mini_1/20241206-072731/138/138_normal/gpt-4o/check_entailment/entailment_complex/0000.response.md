The given Python program meets the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s an analysis of the code:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(arr, element)` takes two parameters: an array `arr` and an `element`. This aligns with the problem description which states it should take in an array and an element.

2. **Searching Mechanism**: The use of a for loop with `enumerate(arr)` allows the function to iterate through each element of the array while keeping track of the index. This is necessary for the functionality described.

3. **Element Comparison**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the current `value` is equal to `element`. If a match is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the found element. This satisfies the requirement that the function should return a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and its index.

4. **Handling Absence of Element**: If the loop completes without finding the element, the function correctly returns `(False, -1)`. This indicates that the element was not found in the array, complying with the requirement stated in the problem description.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided demonstrate that the function is tested against various scenarios, confirming its correctness for different input cases.

The function handles all specified cases correctly:
- It returns `True` and the correct index when the element is found.
- It returns `False` and `-1` when the element is not present in the array.

Since the implementation correctly fulfills the problem description for all specified cases, we can conclude that the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
