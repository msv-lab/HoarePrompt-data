Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `arr` and an element of any data type. It searches for the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. If found, it returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence; if not found, it returns `False` and -1. This means the function has a straightforward mechanism for indicating the presence or absence of an element and its position, covering all potential cases without any missing logic. **
