You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and element can be of any data type.
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements, `element` is the value being searched for in `arr`. If the element is found, the output is `True` and the index of the first occurrence; otherwise, the loop does not execute and no value is returned, with the original `arr` remaining unchanged.
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False, indicating that the element is not found in the list 'arr', and -1, indicating that there is no valid index for the first occurrence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` and an element of any data type. It searches for the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. If found, it returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence; if not found, it returns `False` and -1. This means the function has a straightforward mechanism for indicating the presence or absence of an element and its position, covering all potential cases without any missing logic.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
