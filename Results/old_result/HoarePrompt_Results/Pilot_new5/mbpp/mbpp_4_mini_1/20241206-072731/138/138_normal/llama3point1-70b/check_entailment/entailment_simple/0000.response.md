Correctness: **True**

The program provided meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take in two parameters: `array` (a list of elements) and `element` (which can be of any type).

2. **Finding the Element**: 
   - The program attempts to find the index of `element` in `array` using the `index` method.
   - If the `element` is found, `array.index(element)` returns the position (index) of the first occurrence of `element`. In this case, the program returns a tuple with `True` and the index.

3. **Handling Not Found Case**: 
   - If `element` is not found in `array`, a `ValueError` is raised. This is caught in the `except` block.
   - In this case, the program returns a tuple with `False` and -1, as specified in the problem description.

4. **Return Types**: The function returns a tuple containing a boolean (indicating presence) and either the index of the element or -1 if it is not found, which aligns perfectly with the problem requirements.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the element is in the array and returns the appropriate values. It handles both found and not found cases accurately, making it compliant with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
