Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element, checks if the element is in the array, and returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating the presence of the element and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). 

The logic uses the `index()` method, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found, and the `try-except` block handles this case effectively. In all possible scenarios, including when the element is present at various positions in the array or absent, the function behaves as expected:

- If the element is present, it returns `(True, index)`.
- If the element is absent, it returns `(False, -1)`.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description without any missing logic or edge cases, confirming its correctness.
