Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism according to the problem description. 

Here is a breakdown of how the function meets the requirements:

1. **Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, which correspond to the area of the triangular base, the height of the triangular prism, and the length of the prism respectively. These are non-negative values, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Volume Calculation**: The function calculates the area of the triangular base using the formula \( \text{base\_area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). It then calculates the volume using the formula \( \text{volume} = \text{base\_area} \times \text{length} \).

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed volume, which is the correct output for the volume of a triangular prism.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code serve to validate that the function correctly computes the volume for given sets of arguments, ensuring that the implementation meets the expected results.

Overall, the program adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description for calculating the volume of a triangular prism.
