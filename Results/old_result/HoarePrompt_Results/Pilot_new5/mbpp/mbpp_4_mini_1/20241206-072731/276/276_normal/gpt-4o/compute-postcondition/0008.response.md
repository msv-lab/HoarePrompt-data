The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists of integers of the same size, and a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the size of both lists. After executing the function body, the program returns the median of the sorted merged list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`. The median is computed based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd, and it depends on the values of the elements in the merged list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, of the same size, and a positive integer `n`, then returns the median of the sorted merged list containing all elements from both lists.**
