#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers of the same size, and size is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, and `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. If `size` is even, then `median` is equal to (merged_list[size // 2 - 1] + merged_list[size // 2]) / 2. If `size` is odd, then `median` is equal to `merged_list[middle_index]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value calculated from the sorted list `merged_list` which contains all elements from `list1` and `list2`, based on whether the `size` is even or odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers `list1` and `list2`, along with a positive integer `size` that is equal to the length of both lists. It merges and sorts these lists to compute the median value. If the size is even, it averages the two middle numbers; if the size is odd, it returns the middle number. This function assumes that both input lists are of the same specified size, and does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or of different lengths.
