The code assigns the value of `size - 1` to `middle_index`. The variable `size` likely represents the length of either `list1` or `list2`, which are both lists of integers of the same size. Therefore, `middle_index` will be equal to the size of the lists minus one. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`.**
