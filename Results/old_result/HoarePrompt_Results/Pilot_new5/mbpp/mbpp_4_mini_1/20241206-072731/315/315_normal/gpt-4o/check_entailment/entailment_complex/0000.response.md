Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to add the given tuple to the given list. The function `func_1(lst, tpl)` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as inputs and returns a new list that is the result of concatenating `lst` with the elements of `tpl`.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Types**: The function accepts a list and a tuple as parameters, as required by the problem description.
  
2. **Concatenation Logic**: The program converts the tuple `tpl` into a list using `list(tpl)` and concatenates it with the list `lst` using the `+` operator. This ensures that all elements of the tuple are added to the end of the list.

3. **Output**: The function returns a new list that contains all the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tpl`, which aligns with the requirement to "add" the tuple to the list.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function is designed to handle lists and tuples of any length, including empty lists or tuples. For example, calling `func_1([], ())` would return `[]`, as expected.

Thus, the function meets the criteria outlined in the problem description in all potential cases, confirming its correctness.
