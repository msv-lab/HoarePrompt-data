Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from `arr`. If there are no duplicates in `arr`, the loop executes for all integers in `arr`. If there are duplicates, the loop terminates early upon finding the first duplicate, and `seen` will contain all integers up to (but not including) the first duplicate.**
