Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to check for duplicate elements in an array of integers. Hereâ€™s why the code is correct based on the problem description:

1. The function `func_1(arr)` initializes an empty set called `seen`.
2. It iterates through each number in the input array `arr`.
3. For each number, it checks if the number is already in the `seen` set:
   - If it is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate exists.
   - If it is not found, it adds the number to the `seen` set.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`, indicating that there are no duplicates in the array.

The assertions provided confirm the function's correctness for the following test cases:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, there are no duplicates, and the expected output is `False`.
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, the number `4` is duplicated, and the expected output is `True`.
- For the input `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, there are multiple duplicates, with `1`, `2`, and `3` appearing more than once, so the expected output is `True`.

Since all potential cases that I can think of are handled correctly, and the logic is sound, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
