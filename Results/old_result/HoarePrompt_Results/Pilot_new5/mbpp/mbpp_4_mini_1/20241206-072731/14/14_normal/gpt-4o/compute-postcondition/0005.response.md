The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. Since `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`, it will now be in the set `seen`. The initial condition states that `num` is not in `seen`, so after executing this code, `seen` will contain `num`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `seen` is a set containing `num`.**
