The given problem description states that the task is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided function `func_1` does not remove lowercase substrings; instead, it constructs a new string that contains only the uppercase characters from the input string `s`. 

Let's assess the code against the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**: We need to remove all lowercase substrings from the string. This implies that after processing the input string, any character that is lowercase should not appear in the output.

2. **Program Logic**: The function iterates over each character in the input string and appends only the uppercase characters to the result string. 

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If the input string consists entirely of lowercase letters, the output should be an empty string. This requirement is somewhat met since the function would return an empty string in such cases. 
   - However, the function does not address the requirement of removing entire lowercase substrings (i.e., it should return a string that is devoid of any lowercase characters, not just concatenate uppercase ones). The problem statement implies that if there are lowercase substrings, they should not even be considered in the output. 

Now, let's analyze the output hints provided:
- The output hints mention that the function returns a string containing all uppercase characters from `s`. This suggests that the function is focused solely on extracting uppercase characters rather than removing lowercase substrings, which doesn't align with the problem description.

Based on this analysis, the function does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description because it does not actually remove lowercase substrings; it merely collects uppercase characters.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to meet the problem description because it does not remove lowercase substrings; instead, it filters out and retains only uppercase characters, which is not what was requested.
