The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of `len(lst)`, where `lst` is likely one of the sublists in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, `len(lst)` will return the length of that particular sublist. The values of `max_list` and `list_of_lists` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `max_len`, which is the length of the specific sublist assigned to `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 sublists, `max_len` is equal to the length of the specific sublist `lst`, and `max_list` remains unchanged.**
