The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`, which is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. The value of `max_list` is now equal to `lst`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 1 sublist, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 1 sublist, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
