To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` with respect to the requirement of finding the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

Here's the program:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
    return (max_len, max_list)
```

### Testing the Program

1. **Provided Test Cases:**
   - For input `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, it correctly returns `(3, [13, 15, 17])`.
   - For input `[[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]`, it correctly returns `(4, [10, 12, 14, 15])`.
   - For input `[[5], [15, 20, 25]]`, it correctly returns `(3, [15, 20, 25])`.

2. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   - What if the input is an empty list, `[]`? The function would return `(0, [])`, which seems correct.
   - What if the input contains lists of equal length, such as `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`? The function will return `(2, [5, 6])`, which is correct since it returns the last one encountered.
   - What if the input contains empty lists, like `[[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]`? The function correctly returns `(2, [3, 4])`, which is expected.
   - What if the input contains only empty lists, like `[[], []]`? The function would return `(0, [])`, which is also correct.

### Conclusion

After evaluating the program against various cases, including edge cases, the program works correctly for all tested scenarios and adheres to the problem description. Thus, no potential cases were found where the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
