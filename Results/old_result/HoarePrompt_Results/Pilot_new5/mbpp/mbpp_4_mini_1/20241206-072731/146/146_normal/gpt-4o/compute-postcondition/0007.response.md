According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list contains at least 2 sublists, the loop will execute one more time for the second sublist. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist. To execute the loop one more time, `list_of_lists` must have at least 2 sublists, and the loop will progress to the next sublist in `list_of_lists`. 

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 sublists, `max_len` remains unchanged, and `max_list` remains unchanged**.
