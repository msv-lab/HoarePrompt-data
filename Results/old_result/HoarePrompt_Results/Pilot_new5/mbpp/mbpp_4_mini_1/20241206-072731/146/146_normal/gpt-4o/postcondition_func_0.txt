The function accepts a list of sublists and returns the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself. If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list. The function effectively finds the longest sublist by comparing lengths, and it correctly handles the case of an empty input list, ensuring that it returns appropriate default values.
