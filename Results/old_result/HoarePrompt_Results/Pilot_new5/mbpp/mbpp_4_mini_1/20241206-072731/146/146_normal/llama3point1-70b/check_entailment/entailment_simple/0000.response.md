Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that finds a list (or lists) of maximum length in a list of lists. 

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist that has that maximum length. The problem description requests that the function should return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. Therefore, the function is not returning the correct output as specified.

2. **Behavior on Empty Input**: The program does not handle the case when `list_of_lists` is empty. If an empty list is passed, calling `max()` on an empty iterable will raise a `ValueError`. The function should be designed to handle this case according to its requirements.

To summarize, the function does not correctly return the list of all maximum-length sublists, and it does not handle empty input appropriately. Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem description.
