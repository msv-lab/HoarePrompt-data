According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 3 sublists, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, and the loop will iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `list_of_lists` must have at least 3 sublists.

Since `lst` represents the current sublist being processed in the loop, and if it is the second iteration, the next `lst` would be the third sublist. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `list_of_lists` contains at least 3 sublists, and for the next iteration, `lst` will be the third sublist in that list.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 3 sublists**
