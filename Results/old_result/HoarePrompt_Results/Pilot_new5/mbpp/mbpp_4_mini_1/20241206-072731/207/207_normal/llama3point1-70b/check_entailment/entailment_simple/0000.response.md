Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are specified to be positive integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. 

The function then calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying `length` by `width`, which is the correct mathematical operation for finding the area of a rectangle. The program adheres to the requirements by ensuring that both inputs are positive integers, and the return value is the computed area.

Since the program performs the specified task of finding the area of a rectangle accurately for all valid inputs (positive integers), it fulfills the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
