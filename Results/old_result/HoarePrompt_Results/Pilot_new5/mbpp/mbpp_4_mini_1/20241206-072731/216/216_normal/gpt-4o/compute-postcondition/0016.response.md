The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. If `lst` is empty, the function returns `False`, indicating that the current value of the list is evaluated to False. If there is more than one element in `lst`, the function checks if the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted list is not equal to 1, returning `False` in that case. Additionally, there are other conditions in the function that may lead to returning `False`. If none of those conditions are met and all consecutive elements in the sorted list differ by 1, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `False` if the list is empty or if any consecutive elements in the sorted list do not differ by 1; otherwise, it returns `True` if all consecutive elements differ by 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `False` if the list is empty or if any consecutive elements in the sorted list do not differ by 1; otherwise, it returns `True` if all consecutive elements differ by 1.**
