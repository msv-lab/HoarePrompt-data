Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the list may contain duplicate consecutive numbers or negative numbers. For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the program will return `True` because it will see the sorted list as `[1, 2, 2, 3]` and check the differences between unique consecutive elements, but it should return `False` because there are duplicates. Moreover, if the input list contains negative numbers such as `[-2, -1, 0, 1]`, the sorted list would show consecutive elements but the program would incorrectly consider these as non-consecutive due to the positive/negative jump. 

Thus, it fails to account for the requirement of unique consecutive integers.
