The program provided checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers by following these steps:

1. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is.
2. It then sorts the list.
3. Using a loop, it checks whether the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list is exactly 1.
4. If any pair does not meet this condition, it returns `False`.
5. If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive elements, it returns `True`.

The function is designed to return `True` for lists that contain only one element or no elements, which means it does not have any pairs to compare, thus technically satisfying the condition of having consecutive numbers (or rather, not violating the condition).

Now, let's evaluate the correctness of the program against the provided problem description:

- The problem description requires the function to determine whether the list contains consecutive numbers.
- The function does correctly check for empty lists and lists with more than one element.
- It also correctly identifies non-consecutive numbers.
- The special case where the list has fewer than 2 elements is handled by returning `True`, which aligns with the logic of having no pairs to compare.

However, the problem description implies that for the case of a single element or an empty list, we do not consider them as "having consecutive numbers" in a meaningful way. The condition of consecutiveness might be interpreted as requiring at least two numbers to establish a sequence. 

In conclusion, while the function handles many cases correctly, it does not explicitly define how to treat single-element lists or empty lists according to the common understanding of consecutive numbers. This lack of clarity could lead to a misunderstanding based on the problem description.

Given these considerations:

Correctness: **False**
