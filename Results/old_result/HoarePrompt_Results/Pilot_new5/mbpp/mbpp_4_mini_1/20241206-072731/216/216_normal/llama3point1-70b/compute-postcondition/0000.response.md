The `lst.sort()` method sorts the list of integers `lst` in place in ascending order. The values of the integers in `lst` are updated to reflect this sorting, while other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a sorted list of integers.

Output State: **`lst` is a sorted list of integers**
