The variable `lst_sorted` is assigned the sorted version of `lst`. Since `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` will be a new list containing the same integers in ascending order. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` in ascending order.**
