To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its functionality based on the provided problem description and the source code.

**Problem Description:** The program is supposed to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program first sorts the list. This is a necessary step to check for consecutive numbers since the numbers need to be in order for their differences to be evaluated correctly.
2. The program then checks if the difference between each successive pair of elements in the sorted list is 1. This is done using a generator expression inside the `all()` function, which returns `True` if all comparisons (list[i] - list[i - 1] == 1) hold true.
3. The program also ensures that all numbers in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set created from the list. If the lengths are the same, it means there are no duplicates in the list.

**Potential Case to Consider:**
- An empty list `[]`. The code will return `True` as `all()` on an empty iterable returns `True`, and the lengths of the list and set will also both be `0`. However, it's debatable whether an empty list can be considered to contain consecutive numbers.
- A list with a single number `[5]` will also return `True` for similar reasons as the empty list.
- A list which contains consecutive numbers but is not unique like `[1, 1, 2]` will return `False` correctly.
- A list that contains numbers that are not consecutive, like `[1, 3, 2]`, will return `True` after sorting since they are unique but not consecutive.

The core issue arises from the definition of "consecutive numbers". Generally, consecutive numbers should imply that there are no gaps between them, and both empty and single-element lists might not adhere to this requirement depending on interpretation.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, there are edge cases that could lead to ambiguity. Thus, the program does not correctly adhere to the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
