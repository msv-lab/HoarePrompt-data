#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the current value of the list `lst`, which is an empty list, is evaluated to False.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`, `i` is `len(lst_sorted) - 2`, and if the loop completes without returning False, then all consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` differ by 1. If `lst_sorted` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `lst_sorted` remains unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` differ by 1, given that the loop completed without returning False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `False` if the list is empty or if any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `lst` do not differ by 1. If all consecutive elements differ by 1, it returns `True`. However, if `lst` has fewer than 2 elements (which makes the check for consecutive differences irrelevant), the function will return `True` as well, because there are no pairs to compare.
