#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of integers from 'nums' that are odd (i.e., not divisible by 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from `nums` (i.e., integers that are not divisible by 2). It does not handle any edge cases regarding empty lists or non-integer elements, but it will safely return an empty list if `nums` is empty.
