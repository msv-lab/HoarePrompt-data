Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly filters the odd numbers from the input list `nums` based on the problem description, which requires the function to filter odd numbers. The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` effectively iterates through each integer in the list and includes it in the resultant list only if it is not divisible by 2, thereby identifying it as an odd number.

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description by returning a new list that contains only the odd integers from `nums`. It properly handles all cases, including an empty list, returning an empty list when `nums` has no elements. There are no constraints in the description regarding non-integer elements, and the function will not raise an error when encountering an empty list.

Thus, the program behaves as expected and fulfills the task outlined in the problem description.
