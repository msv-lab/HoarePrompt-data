Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from `nums` (i.e., integers that are not divisible by 2). It does not handle any edge cases regarding empty lists or non-integer elements, but it will safely return an empty list if `nums` is empty. **
