The provided program aims to return the first element of each sublist from a given list of sublists. However, it does not handle cases where the sublists may be empty. 

For example, if the input is:
```python
func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4, 5]])
```
The program would raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the first element of an empty list.

Therefore, the code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, as it does not work for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
