You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of sublists, where each sublist is non-empty.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist from the list 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-empty sublists and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. If any of the sublists in the input list were empty, a potential IndexError would occur, but the function assumes all sublists are non-empty based on the provided context.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
