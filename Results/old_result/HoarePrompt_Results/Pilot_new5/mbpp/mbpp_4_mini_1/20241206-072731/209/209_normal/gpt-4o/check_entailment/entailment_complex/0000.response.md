Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of non-empty sublists and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Assumption**: The function assumes that each sublist in the input list `lst` is non-empty, which aligns with the assertion that is made before the function call. The problem description specifies that the function should get the first element of each sublist, and the program correctly implements this by directly accessing the first element of each sublist using `sublist[0]`.

2. **List Comprehension**: The use of a list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` efficiently constructs a new list by iterating over each sublist in `lst` and collecting the first element. This matches the requirement of extracting the first element from each sublist.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code serve to validate that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. They confirm that for the provided inputs, the function produces the correct outputs.

Since the program adheres to the problem requirements and handles the specified case of non-empty sublists appropriately, it is correct. The potential risk of an `IndexError` due to empty sublists is acknowledged and deemed irrelevant given the context of the assumptions made prior to function execution.
