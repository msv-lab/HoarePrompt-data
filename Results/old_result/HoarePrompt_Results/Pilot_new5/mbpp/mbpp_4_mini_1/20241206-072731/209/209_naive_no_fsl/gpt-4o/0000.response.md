Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. For example, if the input is `func_1([[], [1, 2]])`, the program will attempt to access the first element of an empty list, which will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
