Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where any of the sublists are empty. If an empty sublist is encountered, attempting to access the first element with `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. For example, for the input `func_1([[], [1, 2], [3]])`, the program will fail because the first sublist is empty. This shows that the function does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
