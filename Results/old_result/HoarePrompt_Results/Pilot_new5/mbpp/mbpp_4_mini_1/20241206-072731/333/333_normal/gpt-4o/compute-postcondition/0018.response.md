According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `expr` string. The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `expr` to iterate over. Since `char` is the next character in the string at the end of the last iteration, we need to determine which character will be processed in the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the current character in `expr`, and since we want to execute the loop one more time, `char` must be the next character in the string. Therefore, we need to increase the index of `char` by 1 to get the next character.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of characters, `char` is the next character in the string after the current one, and the loop will continue to execute for the next character in `expr`.**
