Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of characters, if `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, `stack` has `char` appended to it. Otherwise, if `char` is in `matching_pairs` and `stack` is empty or the popped element from `stack` does not match `matching_pairs[char]`, the function returns False, indicating a mismatch in the pairing context.***
