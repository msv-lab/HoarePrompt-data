Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in the string, and `stack` is empty. If `stack` is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding character in `matching_pairs[char]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues execution without returning a value.***
