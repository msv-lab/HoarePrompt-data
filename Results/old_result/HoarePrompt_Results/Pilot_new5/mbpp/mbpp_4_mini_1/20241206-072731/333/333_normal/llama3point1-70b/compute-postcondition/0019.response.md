The code `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `stack`. The variable `stack` is affected by this operation, but no other variables are changed. Given that `char` is defined as the next character in the string `expression`, the output state will reflect the current state of `stack` after the character has been added.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the next character in the string, `stack` is updated to include `char`**.
