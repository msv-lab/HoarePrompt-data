According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expr` string. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `expr`. At the end of the last iteration, `expr` has at least 1 character, and `char` is currently set to the last character in `expr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be the next character in the `expr` string. 

If `char` is the last character, the next character cannot be accessed anymore, which means the loop will not execute again. Therefore, the loop will need to adjust the index to be one character beyond the last character of `expr`, which would mean that there are no more characters left for `char`.

State: **`expr` is a string consisting of characters that has at least 1 character, `char` is the next character in the string, and `stack` remains empty.**
