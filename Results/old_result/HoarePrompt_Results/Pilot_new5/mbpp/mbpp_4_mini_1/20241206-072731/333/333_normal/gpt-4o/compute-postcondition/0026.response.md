The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expr`. `expr` is a string consisting of characters, including parentheses, brackets, and braces. After executing the function body, the function can return multiple values based on different cases: 

- In Case 1, it returns `False`, indicating that a character does not have a matching pair in the stack or that the stack is still empty.
- In Case 2, it returns `False`.
- In Case 3, it returns `False`, indicating a condition that is not met within the context of the execution.
- In Case 4, it returns `True`, indicating that the stack is empty, confirming that all opening symbols in the string `expr` have been properly closed by their corresponding closing symbols.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `expr` and check for proper matching of parentheses, brackets, and braces, returning `True` or `False` based on whether all symbols are properly matched and closed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `expr`, which is a string of characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and returns `True` if all opening symbols are properly closed; otherwise, it returns `False` based on various conditions.**
