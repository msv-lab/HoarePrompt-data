According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If there are more characters left in the `expression`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `expression` is a non-empty string, and `char` is one of the characters being processed from that string. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `expression` must have at least one more character remaining, and `char` would be the next character in the `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `char` is the next character in the `expression`**
