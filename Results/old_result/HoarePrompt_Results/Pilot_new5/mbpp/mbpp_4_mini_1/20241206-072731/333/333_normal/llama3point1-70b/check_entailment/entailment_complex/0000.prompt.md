You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string that may contain various characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string that may contain any characters, `stack` is an empty list if all brackets are matched and closed properly or contains unmatched opening brackets if there are any, the length of `stack` represents the number of unmatched opening brackets. The function returns True if all brackets are matched and False if there is any unmatched opening bracket.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if all brackets in 'expression' are matched and closed properly, and False if there are unmatched opening brackets in 'stack'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `expression` and checks for balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces. It returns True if all opening brackets are correctly matched and closed by their corresponding closing brackets; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not account for other characters in the string, which may lead to misinterpretation of balanced expressions if they are present alongside brackets.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
