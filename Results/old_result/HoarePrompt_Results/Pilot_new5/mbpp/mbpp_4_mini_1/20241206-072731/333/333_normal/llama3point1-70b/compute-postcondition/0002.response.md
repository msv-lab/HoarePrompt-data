According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expression`. For the loop to be executed, `expression` must be a non-empty string, as the loop iterates over each character in the string. The initial state of `stack` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop, but itâ€™s important to note that `char` will represent each character in `expression` during the iterations.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `expression` must not be an empty string, and the first character `char` will be the first character in the `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the expression**
