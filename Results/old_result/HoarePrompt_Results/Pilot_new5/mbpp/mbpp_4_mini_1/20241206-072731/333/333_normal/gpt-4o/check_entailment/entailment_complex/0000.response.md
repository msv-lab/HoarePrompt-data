Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to check if a given expression containing parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced.

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr`, which is composed of characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces. This directly aligns with the problem description.

2. **Use of Stack**: It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening symbols. This is a standard approach to solving the balanced parentheses problem, as it allows for a Last In, First Out (LIFO) mechanism that matches the most recent opening symbol with an appropriate closing symbol.

3. **Matching Pairs**: The program defines a dictionary called `matching_pairs` that maps closing symbols to their corresponding opening symbols. This enables quick lookup to validate pairs as they are encountered.

4. **Iterative Checking**: The program iterates through each character in the input string:
   - If it encounters an opening symbol (from the values of `matching_pairs`), it pushes it onto the stack.
   - If it encounters a closing symbol (from the keys of `matching_pairs`), it checks whether the stack is empty (indicating an unmatched closing symbol) or whether the top of the stack matches the expected opening symbol. If either condition fails, it returns `False`.

5. **Final Validation**: After iterating through the string, the program checks if the stack is empty. An empty stack means all opening symbols were matched correctly with closing symbols, thus returning `True`. If the stack is not empty, it indicates unmatched opening symbols, and thus the function would return `False`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function also handles edge cases effectively:
   - An empty input string will return `True`, as there are no unmatched symbolsâ€”this is explicitly stated in the final comment and is a necessary condition for balanced strings.

Overall, the program comprehensively checks for balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces as specified in the problem description, ensuring correct behavior for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the implementation is confirmed.
