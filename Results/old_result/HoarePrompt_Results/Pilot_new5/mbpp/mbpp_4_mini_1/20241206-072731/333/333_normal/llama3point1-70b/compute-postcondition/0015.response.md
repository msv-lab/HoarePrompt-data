Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, if the stack is empty or the character popped from the stack does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping, the function returns False. If the stack is not empty and the popped character matches `char`, there is no action taken (the function proceeds).***
