According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `arr` list and the current value of `i`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `arr` has at least one element, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element in the list `arr`, which is not equal to `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment by 1 to 1, and `x` must be the second element in the list `arr`. Additionally, since `arr` has at least one element, it must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`.**
