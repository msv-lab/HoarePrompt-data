Postcondition: ***`arr` has at least one element and `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` while `high` remains unchanged, and `mid` is recalculated as (low + high) // 2. Otherwise, `low` remains less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1.***
