The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, which means `high` will decrease by 1 from its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `high` is now `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `high` is now `mid - 1.**
