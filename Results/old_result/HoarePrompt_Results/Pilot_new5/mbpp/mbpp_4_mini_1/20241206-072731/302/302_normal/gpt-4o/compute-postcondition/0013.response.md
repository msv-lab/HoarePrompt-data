Postcondition: ***`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` is `mid`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `((len(arr) - 1) // 2) + 1` while `high` remains `len(arr) - 1`, and `mid` is recalculated accordingly. If `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` while `low` remains 0, and `mid` is recalculated, ensuring that `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`.***
