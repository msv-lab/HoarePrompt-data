The variable `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Based on the initial state, `mid` is calculated as `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. Since `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target` but not equal to `target`, the value of `high` will be a valid index that is less than `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer; `low` is 0; `high` is `mid - 1`; `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`; the value of `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`; and `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`.**
