Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number (`target`) in a sorted array (`arr`). 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Sorted Array**: The function assumes that the input array is sorted in non-decreasing order, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The program utilizes a binary search approach to efficiently locate the target number. This is appropriate given that the array is sorted.

3. **Finding the First Occurrence**: The logic within the `while` loop does the following:
   - When the middle element (`arr[mid]`) matches the target, it captures the index in `result` and continues searching in the left half of the array (by setting `high = mid - 1`). This ensures that it finds the first occurrence of the target.
   - If the middle element is less than the target, it moves the search to the right half (by setting `low = mid + 1`).
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, it searches in the left half (by setting `high = mid - 1`).

4. **Returning Result**: After the loop concludes, the function returns the `result` index:
   - If `target` is found, `result` will hold the index of its first occurrence.
   - If `target` is not present in the array, `result` remains `-1`, indicating that the number was not found.

5. **Correctness Check**: The assertions provided in the annotated program verify that the function returns the expected indexes for specific input cases, reinforcing the correctness of the implementation.

Overall, the function meets the problem requirements comprehensively for all potential cases, including edge cases where the target is not present, as well as when it appears multiple times. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
