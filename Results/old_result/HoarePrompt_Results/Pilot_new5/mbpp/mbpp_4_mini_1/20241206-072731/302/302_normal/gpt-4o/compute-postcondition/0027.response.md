`high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` has been calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `high` will now be one less than `mid`. The values of `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `mid` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` has at least one element, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high, `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is now `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` has at least one element, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is `mid - 1`.**
