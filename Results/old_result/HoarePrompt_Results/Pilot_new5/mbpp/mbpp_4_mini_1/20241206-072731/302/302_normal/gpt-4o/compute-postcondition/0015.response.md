The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The states of the other variables, `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `high`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation of `mid` based on the values of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2.**
