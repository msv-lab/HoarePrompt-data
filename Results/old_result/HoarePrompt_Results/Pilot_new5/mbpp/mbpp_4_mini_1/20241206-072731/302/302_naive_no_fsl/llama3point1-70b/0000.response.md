Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the edge case where the input array contains duplicate values. According to the problem description, the function should return the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, the program uses a linear search, which will return the index of the first matching element it encounters. Here's a case where it fails:

Input: `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4], num = 2`
Expected Output: `1` (the index of the first occurrence of `2`)
Actual Output: `1` (the index of the first occurrence of `2`, which matches)

However, consider the input `arr = [], num = 2`. The expected output is `-1` because the array is empty, and there are no elements to find. The program does return `-1`, which is correct.

Now consider the case where the input is `arr = [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]` and `num = 1`. The expected output is `0`, which is correct because `0` is the index of the first occurrence of `1`.

So, if we try a different scenario like `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 5`, the expected output is `-1`, and the program returns `-1`, which is also correct.

After testing multiple cases, we realize that the program works correctly for the expected input scenarios of returning the index of the first occurrence, including edge cases.

Based on all the above, the program does seem to satisfy the requirements of the problem description; however, it is only partially correct because it uses a linear search instead of an efficient binary search due to the array being sorted. The linear search won't be optimal but does return the correct first index.

Correctness: **True**

The function correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of a specified number in a sorted array, returning `-1` for elements not present and handling duplicates correctly by returning the index of the first match.
