The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The previous calculation of `mid` is still valid, as it was calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `mid` was used in determining `high`, the specific value of `high` now becomes `mid - 1`. 

Output State: **`arr` has at least one element, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high, `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, `result` is equal to `mid`, and `high` is now equal to `mid - 1`.**
