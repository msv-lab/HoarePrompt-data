Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The implementation uses a binary search algorithm, which is efficient for sorted arrays. 

Here's how the function works:

1. It initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the current section of the array being searched.
2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
3. In each iteration, it calculates the middle index (`mid`) of the current section.
4. If the value at `mid` is equal to the target, it stores the index in `result` and continues searching in the left half of the array (by updating `high` to `mid - 1`) to find the first occurrence.
5. If the value at `mid` is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer up to search in the right half.
6. If the value at `mid` is greater than the target, it moves the `high` pointer down to search in the left half.
7. If the target is found, it returns the index; if not found, it returns -1.

The function correctly identifies the first occurrence of a number in the sorted array. The assertions provided verify that it works for the specified test cases. 

I cannot think of any edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail, as it handles all potential cases for the problem description effectively. Hence, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements.
