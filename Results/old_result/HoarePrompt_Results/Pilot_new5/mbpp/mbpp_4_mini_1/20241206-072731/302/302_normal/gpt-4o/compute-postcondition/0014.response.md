According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will continue as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `arr` must have at least one element, which provides a valid range for `low` and `high`. However, we do not have specific values for `low` and `high` in the provided state, but we know `low` needs to be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute again.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `low` is still such that it does not exceed `high`. Since we don't have specific values, we can state that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is that `low` must still be less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
