The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `high` will be one less than the current value of `mid`. The values of the other variables (`arr`, `target`, `low`, and `mid`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `target` is an integer; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `high` is equal to `mid - 1`.**
