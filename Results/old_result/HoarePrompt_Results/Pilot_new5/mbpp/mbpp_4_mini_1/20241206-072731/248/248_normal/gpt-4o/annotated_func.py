#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be of any data type.
def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)
    #The program returns a tuple containing all elements from the list 'lst', which can be of any data type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` containing elements of any data type and returns a tuple containing all elements from that list. It does not perform any validation or handle potential edge cases such as an empty list. An empty list will simply return an empty tuple.
