Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. It handles all potential cases, including:

1. An empty list `[]`, which would correctly convert to an empty tuple `()`.
2. A list with a single element `[1]`, which would convert to the tuple `(1,)`.
3. A list with multiple elements `[1, 2, 3]`, which would convert to the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`.
4. A list containing mixed data types `[1, 'a', 3.14]`, which would convert to the tuple `(1, 'a', 3.14)` without any issues.

Since there are no edge cases or potential inputs where the program fails to meet the problem description, the function behaves as expected for all inputs. Thus, the program is correct.
