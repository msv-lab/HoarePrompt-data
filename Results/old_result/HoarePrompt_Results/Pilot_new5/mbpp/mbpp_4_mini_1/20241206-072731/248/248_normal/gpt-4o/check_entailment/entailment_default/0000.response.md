The provided program defines a function `func_1(lst)` that converts a list to a tuple. The assertion tests indicate that it should work correctly for non-empty lists. An important aspect to consider is the handling of an empty list, which is specified in the output hints: "An empty list will simply return an empty tuple."

Examining the code:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)
```

This function indeed uses Python's built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list `lst` to a tuple. It will correctly handle any list, including an empty list, resulting in an empty tuple.

Now, looking at the output hints: 
- The hints say that the function accepts a list containing elements of any data type and returns a tuple. This matches what the code does.
- They also state that it does not perform any validation or handle potential edge cases, which is true, but not necessary for this specific task as per the problem description.

Since the function successfully converts all provided examples, including the edge case of an empty list, into the expected tuple format, we can conclude that the code meets the problem description for all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly converts a list, including an empty list, to a tuple as stipulated in the problem description. There are no edge cases where the function behaves incorrectly based on the provided hints and examples.
