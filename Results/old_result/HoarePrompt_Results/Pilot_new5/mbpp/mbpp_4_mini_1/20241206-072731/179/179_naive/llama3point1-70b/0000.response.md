Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function correctly computes the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers. The range generates even numbers starting from 2 up to the nth even number (inclusive), and then calculates the cube of each of these numbers. Since the function follows the problem description and correctly handles the input for any positive integer n, it is considered correct. For example, if n = 3, the function calculates \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\), which is the expected result. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that cause it to fail.
