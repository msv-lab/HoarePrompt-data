To assess the correctness of the given Python program that computes the cube sum of the first \( n \) even natural numbers, let's analyze both the problem description and the provided code.

**Problem description:** We need a function to find the cube sum of the first \( n \) even natural numbers.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))
    return cube_sum
```

**Initial assessment:**
1. The function `func_1(n)` generates the first \( n \) even natural numbers correctly using the list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
2. It computes the cube sum using the expression `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`, which raises each even number to the power of 3 and sums them correctly.
3. The assertions seem to validate that the function works correctly for \( n = 2 \), \( n = 3 \), and \( n = 4 \).

**Edge cases:**
- What if \( n = 0 \)? The function should return \( 0 \) since there are no even numbers to sum.
- For negative values of \( n \), the function is not defined according to the problem description, so we assume \( n \) should be non-negative.

**Output hints:** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even numbers. It also states that this sum can be computed as \( 8 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 \). This formula corresponds to the sum of cubes of the first \( n \) even numbers because the \( n^{th} \) even number is \( 2n \), and the sum of cubes formula applies directly.

**Agreement of hints with the code:**
- The hints support the code's logic for \( n \geq 1 \) as examples for \( n = 2, 3, 4 \) produce the expected results.
- The hints indicate that the function does indeed compute the right values and provides a mathematical backing for the expected output.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not check for the edge case where \( n = 0 \), and thus it will return \( 0 \) which is correct in this case. However, the lack of explicit handling of this case could lead to confusion about the function's expected behavior when non-positive integers are provided. Still, since the problem statement implies \( n \) should be non-negative, we consider this as acceptable.

Given that the function behaves correctly for valid inputs based on the provided specifications and mathematical hints, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
