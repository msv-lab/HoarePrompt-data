Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers. The first n even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to 2n.

2. **Implementation Details**: 
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
   - It uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to iterate over the range of even numbers from 2 up to `2n`.
   - The range is defined as `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`, which correctly generates the even numbers 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.
   - For each of these even numbers, it computes the cube (`i ** 3`) and sums them up.

3. **Correctness of the Calculation**: 
   - For example, if `n = 3`, the first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The cubes of these numbers are 8, 64, and 216 respectively, and their sum is 288. The function returns this value correctly.

Thus, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description for all valid non-negative integer inputs, confirming that it is indeed correct.
