To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it correctly computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers based on the problem description.

The program defines the first `n` even natural numbers as follows:
- For `n=2`, the even numbers are `2, 4`. The cube sum should be `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`, which matches the assertion.
- For `n=3`, the even numbers are `2, 4, 6`. The cube sum should be `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`, which also matches the assertion.
- For `n=4`, the even numbers are `2, 4, 6, 8`. The cube sum should be `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`, which matches the assertion as well.

The program seems to handle these cases correctly. However, we need to consider edge cases and see if there are any potential inputs that may lead to incorrect computation:

1. **Edge Case: `n=0`** 
   - If `n` is 0, there should be no even numbers to consider, and thus the function should return a cube sum of `0`. The current implementation will return `0`, since the list comprehension will yield an empty list, and the sum of an empty list is `0`. This is correct behavior.

2. **Edge Case: Negative Input** 
   - If `n` is negative, the function should ideally handle this case properly. However, the current implementation will also yield an empty list (since `range(1, n + 1)` will not produce any numbers), and sum of an empty list is `0`. This is not mentioned in the problem description, which does not define behavior for negative inputs. Therefore, it is unclear if `func_1(-1)` is a valid input and what it should return.

Given these considerations, the program does not define behavior for negative inputs and does not raise an error for such cases. Hence, it could lead to unexpected results.

Correctness: **False**
