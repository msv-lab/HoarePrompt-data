The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it calculates the value of `cube_sum` as \(8 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2\) for the given non-negative integer `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the calculated value of `cube_sum` based on the formula provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a non-negative integer, and returns cube_sum calculated as \(8 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2\).**
