The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 up to `n * 2`. It generates this sum by iterating through the range of even numbers starting from 2 up to and including `n * 2`. Since `n` is specified as a non-negative integer, the function will behave correctly for all valid input values, including `n = 0`, which results in a sum of 0 because there are no even integers in the range. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function encompasses all non-negative integers, returning the expected sum of cubes for valid inputs including the edge case when `n` is 0.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to `n * 2`, which is 0 if `n` is 0. **
