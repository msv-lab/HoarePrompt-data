Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets those requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input, which is guaranteed to have at least one character.

2. **Word Splitting**: The string is split into words using `s.split()`, which allows the function to analyze each individual word.

3. **Looping Through Words**: The function iterates through each word in the `words` list. This approach ensures that every word in the input string is checked.

4. **Length Check**: The condition `len(word) > 1` ensures that only words with more than one character are examined. This is essential because a single-character word cannot have a 'z' that is not at the start or end.

5. **Substring Check**: The critical check `if 'z' in word[1:-1]` looks for the letter 'z' in the substring of the `word` that excludes its first and last characters. This directly aligns with the problem requirement to check for 'z' only in the middle of the word.

6. **Return Values**: The function returns `True` immediately if it finds a word that meets the criteria. If no such word is found after checking all words, it returns `False`.

Because the function handles all scenarios described in the problem statement correctly—checking all words, ensuring they are long enough, and verifying the position of 'z'—it can be concluded that the implementation is correct.
