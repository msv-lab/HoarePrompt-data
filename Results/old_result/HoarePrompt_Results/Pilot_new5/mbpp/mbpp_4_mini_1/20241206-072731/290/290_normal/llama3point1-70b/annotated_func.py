#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string with at least one character.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string with at least one character, `words` is a list of words derived from `s`, `word` is the last word in the list or no `word` if `words` is empty. If there are any words with length greater than 1 that contain the letter 'z' in the substring excluding the first and last character, the function would have returned True during the iterations; otherwise, the function does not return anything.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that there are no words with length greater than 1 that contain the letter 'z' in the substring excluding the first and last character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if any word in `s` has a length greater than 1 and contains the letter 'z' within its internal characters (i.e., excluding the first and last characters). If no such words exist, the function returns `False`. The function does not check if the entire string `s` has a length greater than 1; it solely evaluates each individual word in the string.
