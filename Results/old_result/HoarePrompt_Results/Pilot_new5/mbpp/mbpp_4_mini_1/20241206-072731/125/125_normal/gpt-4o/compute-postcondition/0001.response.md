According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `n <= len(lst)`, the loop will execute for each element in `lst`. 

At the beginning of the loop:
- The variable `i` will start at 0 (the first index of `lst`).
- The variable `element` will also start as the first element of `lst`.

To ensure the loop can execute:
1. `lst` must not be empty; it can have at least 1 element.
2. The index `i` should be initialized to 0.
3. The `element` must be set to the first element of `lst`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are as follows:

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer such that `n <= len(lst)`, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`**
