#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` contains all elements from `lst` distributed across `n` sublists in a round-robin manner, with `len(result[j])` approximately equal to `len(lst) // n` for each `j`, and `lst` must have at least `n` elements.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result' which contains all elements from 'lst' distributed across 'n' sublists in a round-robin manner, with each sublist having a length approximately equal to 'len(lst) // n', and 'lst' has at least 'n' elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, distributing the elements of `lst` into `n` sublists in a round-robin manner. The function returns a list of these `n` sublists. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the result will contain empty sublists for the remaining indices. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than or equal to zero, nor does it validate whether `lst` is empty or contains fewer elements than `n`.
