You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list containing sublists of 'lst', where each sublist consists of elements taken from 'lst' starting at index 'i' and continuing in steps of 'n', for each 'i' in the range from 0 to n-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists, where each sublist consists of elements taken from `lst` starting at each index from 0 to n-1 and continuing in steps of `n`. It assumes that `n` is greater than 0 and does not handle cases where `lst` is empty, which would result in a list of empty sublists.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
