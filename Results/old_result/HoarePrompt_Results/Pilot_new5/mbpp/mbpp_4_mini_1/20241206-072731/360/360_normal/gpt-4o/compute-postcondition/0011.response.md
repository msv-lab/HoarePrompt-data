The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is defined as the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` now holds the entire second inner list. The values of `max_sum`, `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
