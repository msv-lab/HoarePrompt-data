The function `func_1` is designed to return the inner list that has the maximum sum among the lists provided in `list_of_lists`. On initial examination, the code appears to correctly accumulate sums of each sublist and compare them to find the maximum. 

However, I need to consider edge cases, particularly the case where the input list `list_of_lists` is empty. According to the problem description, the function should return an empty list in this scenario. The current implementation does not account for an empty input list, which means it may throw an error or behave unexpectedly when attempting to sum elements of a non-existent sublist.

The output hints specify that if the input is empty, the function should return an empty list. This aligns with the expectation set by the problem description, but the implementation does not handle this case effectively.

Considering these points, the program fails to follow the problem description in one potential case: an empty input list.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case where the input list of lists is empty, which means it does not adhere to the requirements set in the problem description for all potential cases.
