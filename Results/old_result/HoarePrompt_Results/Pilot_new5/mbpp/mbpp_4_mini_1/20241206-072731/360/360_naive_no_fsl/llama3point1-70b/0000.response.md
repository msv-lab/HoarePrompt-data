Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist from the list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. 

### Explanation:
- The function uses the `max()` function with the `key` parameter set to `sum`, which efficiently calculates the sum of each sublist and determines which one has the highest sum.
- The program handles cases where all sublists have different sums, as well as cases where some sublists may have equal sums. In the case of ties, `max()` will return the first one it encounters, which is a behavior that can be acceptable depending on the problem context (though not explicitly stated in the problem description).
- Additionally, if the input list is empty, `max()` would raise a `ValueError`. However, this situation may not be an expected input as the problem description does not mention handling empty lists. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the input will always contain at least one list.
- The code works correctly for valid inputs, and I cannot find any specific examples where it fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement. 

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description accurately, processing the provided input as intended.
