`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. Since `sublist` is defined as the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` will reflect the total of that specific inner list. The values of `max_sum`, `max_list`, and the condition of `list_of_lists` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.
