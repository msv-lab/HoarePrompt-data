Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing numerical elements (either integers or floats). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Functionality**: The program uses the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument. This effectively finds the inner list within `lists` that has the highest sum of its elements. 

3. **Return Value**: The function returns that inner list, which is exactly what the problem description requires: to return the list whose sum of elements is the highest.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function will return the first inner list with the highest sum in case of ties (multiple inner lists having the same maximum sum), which is a reasonable and expected behavior and does not contradict the problem requirements.

Overall, the annotated program adheres to the problem description by correctly identifying and returning the inner list with the highest sum of its elements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
