The assignment `max_list = sublist` means that `max_list` is updated to hold the value of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` now contains that inner list. The previous value of `max_sum` remains unchanged. Other variables are not affected by this execution.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `max_list` contains the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 inner list, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, and `current_sum` is greater than the previous `max_sum`.**
