The variable `max_list` is assigned an empty list. This does not impact the other variables (`list_of_lists` and `max_sum`) since they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements; `max_sum` is set to negative infinity; `max_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements; `max_sum` is set to negative infinity; `max_list` is an empty list.**
