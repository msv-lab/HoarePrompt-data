`max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. The value of `sublist` is the second inner list from `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The values of `max_sum` and `current_sum` remain unchanged, and `max_list` now contains the values of `sublist`. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list, `current_sum` is the sum of `sublist`.**
