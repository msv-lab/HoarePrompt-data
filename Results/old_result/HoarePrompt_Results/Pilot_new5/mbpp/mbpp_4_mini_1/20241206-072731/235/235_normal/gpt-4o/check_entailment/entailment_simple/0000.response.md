Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Input Constraints**: The function takes a non-negative integer `n`. The assertion before the function checks the correctness of the implementation with examples, which implies that the function is expected to handle non-negative integers.

2. **Sum of Digits Logic**: The function initializes a variable `total` to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. Inside the loop:
   - The last digit of `n` is obtained using `n % 10` and added to `total`.
   - The last digit is then removed from `n` using integer division by 10 (`n //= 10`).

   This process effectively extracts each digit of `n`, starting from the least significant digit, and accumulates their sum in `total`.

3. **Handling Zero**: If the input `n` is 0, the loop does not execute because the condition `n > 0` is false. Therefore, `total` remains 0, which is the correct sum of the digits for the input 0.

4. **Return Value**: After the loop completes, the function returns the `total`, which correctly represents the sum of the digits of the original number `n`.

The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works as expected for specific test cases (345, 12, 97), yielding the correct sums of their digits (12, 3, and 16, respectively).

Overall, the implementation efficiently calculates the sum of the digits for any non-negative integer, thereby fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
