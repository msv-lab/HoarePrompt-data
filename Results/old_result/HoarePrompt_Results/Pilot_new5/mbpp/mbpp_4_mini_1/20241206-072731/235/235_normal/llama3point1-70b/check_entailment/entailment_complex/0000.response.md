Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Specification**: The function accepts a non-negative integer as intended. The annotations clearly state that the state before the function call guarantees `n` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Digit Summation Logic**: Inside the function, the expression `sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` converts the integer `n` to a string, iterates over each character (which represents a digit), converts each character back to an integer, and computes the sum of these integers. This effectively calculates the sum of the digits of `n`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function does not need to handle negative integers or other types of inputs, as specified in the problem description, because it is guaranteed that `n` will always be a non-negative integer. Therefore, it does not encounter any edge cases that would violate the problem requirements.

4. **Output Verification**: The return value of the function is directly aligned with the problem's requirement of returning the sum of the digits.

Given these points, the program adheres strictly to the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality for all valid inputs.
