#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the non-negative integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It handles any non-negative integer input correctly, summing the individual digits of `n` as intended. There are no edge cases or missing logic since `n` is always non-negative and the function directly computes the desired output without any additional conditions.
