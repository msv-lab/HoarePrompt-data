Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is designed to compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. While it does work for the provided asserts (345, 12, and 97), it does not handle the case when the input is zero.

For the input `0`, the expected output should be `0` since the sum of the digits of `0` is `0`. However, the function doesn't have a check for this input before entering the while loop. 

When `func_1(0)` is called:
- The while condition `n > 0` is false, so the loop does not execute.
- The function returns the initial value of `total`, which is `0`. 

While this does yield the correct result for `0`, there is no explicit handling or consideration for this edge case in the code. However, if the function were to be extended or modified in the future, it might inadvertently fail to consider this edge case. 

Thus, the function does not explicitly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
