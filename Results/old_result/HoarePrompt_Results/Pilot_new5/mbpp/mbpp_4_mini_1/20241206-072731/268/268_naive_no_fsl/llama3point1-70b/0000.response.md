To evaluate the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze whether the function `func_1` accurately returns the maximum value from the nth column of a given matrix.

The main points to consider are:

1. **Input Format**: The function expects `matrix`, a list of lists, and `n`, an integer representing the column index. However, the function accesses `row[n - 1]`, which implies that it expects `n` to be 1-based (i.e., 1 corresponds to the first column).

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in any row of the matrix, the program will throw an `IndexError` since it will attempt to access a column that does not exist.
   - If the matrix is empty, the function will also throw a `ValueError` because the `max()` function will not have any values to operate on.

3. **Checking Behavior**:
   - For a matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]` and `n = 2`, the expected output is `8`, which the program handles correctly.
   - For `n = 0` or `n = 4` on the same matrix, it should raise an error, but the function does not handle this case, leading to incorrect behavior.
   - For an empty matrix `[]` and any value of `n`, the function will also raise an error.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails in the following cases:
- If `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns, the program will throw an `IndexError`.
- If the input matrix is empty, the program will throw a `ValueError`.
