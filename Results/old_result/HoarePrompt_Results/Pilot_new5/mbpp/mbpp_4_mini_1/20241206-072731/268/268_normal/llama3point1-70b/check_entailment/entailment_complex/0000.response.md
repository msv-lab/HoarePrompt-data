Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements set forth in the problem description. While the function is intended to return the maximum value from the n-th column of a given matrix, it has several flaws:

1. **Indexing Error**: The program uses `row[n - 1]` to access the n-th column. However, according to the problem description, `n` should be interpreted as a zero-based index, meaning the function should access `row[n]` instead.

2. **Lack of Error Handling**: The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the valid range (i.e., if `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in `matrix` or if `matrix` is empty). This can result in an `IndexError`, which contradicts the requirement that the function should operate correctly under the stated conditions.

3. **Column Access on Empty Matrix**: The code does not check if the matrix is empty before attempting to access `matrix[0]`, which could also lead to an error.

In summary, due to these issues, the program does not reliably meet the problem description's requirements for all potential cases, leading to its classification as incorrect.
