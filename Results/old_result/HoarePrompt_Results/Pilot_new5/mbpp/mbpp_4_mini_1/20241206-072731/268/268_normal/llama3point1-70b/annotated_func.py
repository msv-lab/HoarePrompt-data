#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists of numbers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is not empty.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the n-th column of the list of lists 'matrix', where n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is not empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `matrix` containing numbers and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the n-th column of the matrix. However, if `n` is not within the valid range (0 <= n < number of columns), the code does not handle this case, potentially leading to an IndexError if the input does not conform to the stated conditions. Additionally, if `matrix` is empty, the function will also raise an error since accessing `matrix[0]` will fail.
