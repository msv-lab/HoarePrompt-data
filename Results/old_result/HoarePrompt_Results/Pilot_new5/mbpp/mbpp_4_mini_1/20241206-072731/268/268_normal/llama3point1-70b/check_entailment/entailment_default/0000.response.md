The provided program aims to return the maximum value from the n-th column of a matrix represented as a list of lists. The problem description specifies that the function should handle all cases, including edge cases.

Initial assessment of the code:
1. The code attempts to obtain the maximum value from the n-th column by using a generator expression that iterates through each row of the matrix and accesses the element at index `n - 1`. 
2. However, there are two major potential issues with this approach:
   - If `n` is out of the valid range (i.e., less than 1 or greater than the number of columns), this will lead to an `IndexError`.
   - If the matrix is empty, attempting to access `row[n - 1]` will also cause an error since there are no elements to access.

Now, let's analyze the output hints:
- The output hints confirm that the function does indeed return the maximum value from the n-th column of the matrix if the input is valid. However, they also indicate that the code does not handle cases where `n` is not within the valid range or where the matrix is empty. This aligns with the potential issues identified in the initial assessment.

Since the code does not cover all cases as described in the problem statement (specifically handling invalid inputs and empty matrices), the program does not meet the requirement for correctness in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle cases where `n` is out of bounds or where the matrix is empty, which would lead to errors.
