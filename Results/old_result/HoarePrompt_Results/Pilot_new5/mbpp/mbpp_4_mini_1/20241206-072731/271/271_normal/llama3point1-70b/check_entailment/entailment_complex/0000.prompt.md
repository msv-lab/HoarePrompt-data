You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, and each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated as the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the number of inner tuples in 'tuples'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values of the same length. It returns a list of averages, with each average calculated as the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the number of inner tuples. There are no checks for empty tuples or tuples with uneven lengths, which could lead to errors or unexpected results if the input does not meet these assumptions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
