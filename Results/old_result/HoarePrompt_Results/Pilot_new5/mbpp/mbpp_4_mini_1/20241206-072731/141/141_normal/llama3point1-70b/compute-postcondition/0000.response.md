The variable `str_n` is assigned the value of `str(n)`, which converts the non-negative integer `n` into its string representation. The state of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `str_n` is the string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `str_n` is the string representation of `n`.**
