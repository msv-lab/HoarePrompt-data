According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digit_str`. The `digit_str` is derived from `n`, which is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute, `digit_str` must not be an empty string, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is 0, `digit_str` will be "0", allowing the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `digit_str` contains at least one character. If `n` is at least 0, then `digit_str` will reflect `n` correctly. Thus, the initial states should include that `n` is a non-negative integer, and `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`. The variable `digit` will represent the first character of `digit_str` during the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`**
