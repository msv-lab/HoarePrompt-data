To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved in the for loop:

1. The loop iterates over `str_n`, which is the string representation of `n`. 
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `str_n` must not be an empty string. 
3. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is 0, `str_n` will be "0", which means the loop will execute once.
4. If `n` is greater than 0, `str_n` will contain characters corresponding to the digits of `n`, ensuring the loop will execute multiple times (once for each digit).

Therefore, we need to ensure that `str_n` is valid (not empty). The states we need to modify or ensure are as follows:

- `n` must be a non-negative integer (this condition is already provided).
- `str_n` must be a string that represents `n` and must not be empty.

For the loop to execute correctly, we can state that:

- If `n` is 0, `str_n` is "0".
- If `n` is greater than 0, `str_n` will contain the digits of `n`.

Given these observations, the appropriate state before the loop executes can be summarized as:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` must be a string representing `n` and is not empty**.
