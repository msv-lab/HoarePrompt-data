In this case, `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. The variable `digit` is the first character of the string representation of `n`, which is a non-negative integer. This means `digit` is a digit character ('0' to '9'). Hence, the value of `frequency[digit]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1.**
