According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `str_n`. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to proceed to the next character in `str_n`. At the end of the last iteration, `str_n` is a non-empty string representing `n`, and the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. 

Since the loop is designed to iterate over `str_n`, we need to determine the current position in the string. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` does not exceed `digit`, the loop will continue to the next character. 

Assuming the current index of the loop is such that we are processing the current `digit`, we need to increment the index to reflect the next character in `str_n`. If `str_n` has a length of at least one more character than the index being processed, the count of `digit` will also need to be updated accordingly.

If the last character processed corresponds to index `i`, then for the loop to execute again, `digit` must refer to the next character in the string at index `i+1`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representing `n`, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is still less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`, and `digit` is the next character in `str_n` at index `i+1`**
