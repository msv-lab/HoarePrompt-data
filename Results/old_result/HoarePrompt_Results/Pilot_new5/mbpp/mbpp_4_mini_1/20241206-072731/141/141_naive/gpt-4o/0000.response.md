Let's analyze the provided problem description and the corresponding program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description:
The function should take an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Program:
```python
assert func_1(1234) == True
assert func_1(51241) == False
assert func_1(321) == True

def func_1(n):
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` first converts the integer into a string to iterate over each digit.
2. It uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each digit.
3. Then, for each digit, it checks if the frequency of that digit is greater than the digit itself (converted to an integer).
4. If any frequency exceeds its corresponding digit value, the function returns `False`. If all checks pass, it returns `True`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- `func_1(0)` should return `True` since the frequency of '0' is `1`, which is not greater than `0`.
- `func_1(111)` should return `True` since the frequency of '1' is `3`, which is greater than `1`.
- `func_1(9876543210)` should return `True` since all digits have a frequency of `1`, which is equal to their values.

### Finding Potential Cases:
1. **Case: `func_1(100)`**
   - The frequency dictionary will be `{'1': 1, '0': 2}`.
   - The digit `0` has a frequency of `2`, which is greater than `0`, so the function should return `False`. 
   However, in terms of the frequency of each digit being less than or equal to the digit, `0` could be incorrectly considered (since `frequency['0']` is `2` which is indeed greater than `0`).

2. **Case: `func_1(222)`**
   - Expected: `False`, because the digit `2` appears 3 times but its value is `2`.

3. **Case: `func_1(121)`**
   - The frequency will be `{'1': 2, '2': 1}`. The frequency for digit `1` (which is `2`) is greater than its value (`1`), so it should return `False`.

These cases highlight that the program does not correctly account for the conditions set forth in the problem description. 

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because there are cases where the frequency of a digit can be greater than the digit itself, and the program does not account for these situations accurately.

Correctness: **False**.
