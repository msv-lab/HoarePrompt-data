Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input snake case string is empty. For an empty string `''`, the expected output would be `''`, but the current implementation will return `None`. This can be demonstrated by the following test case:

```python
assert func_1('') == ''  # This will fail
```

Since the program fails for at least one input case, it is deemed incorrect.
