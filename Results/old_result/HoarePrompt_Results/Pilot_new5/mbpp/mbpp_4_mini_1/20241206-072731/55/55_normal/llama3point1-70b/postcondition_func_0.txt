The function accepts a string `snake_case_str` consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, and returns its camel case equivalent by concatenating the capitalized words obtained from splitting `snake_case_str` by underscores. No checks are made for empty strings or strings that do not contain underscores, which would affect the output. If `snake_case_str` is empty, the function will return an empty string.
