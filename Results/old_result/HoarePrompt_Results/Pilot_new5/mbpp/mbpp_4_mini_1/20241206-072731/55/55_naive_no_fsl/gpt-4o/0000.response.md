Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` does not handle all potential edge cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to account for the following scenarios:

1. **Empty String**: If the input string is empty (`''`), the function will return an empty string, which may or may not be the expected behavior based on how "conversion" is interpreted in this context.

2. **Leading or Trailing Underscores**: If the input string has leading or trailing underscores (e.g., `'_snake_case'` or `'snake_case_'`), the function will return incorrect results. For instance:
   - `func_1('_snake_case')` would return `'SnakeCase'`, ignoring the leading underscore.
   - `func_1('snake_case_')` would return `'SnakeCase'`, ignoring the trailing underscore.

3. **Consecutive Underscores**: If the input string has consecutive underscores (e.g., `'snake__case'`), the function will produce an unexpected output because it will generate an empty string component for the part between the underscores, leading to:
   - `func_1('snake__case')` returning `'SnakeCase'`, missing the representation of the empty segment.

These cases illustrate that the function does not handle certain valid inputs correctly, thereby making it incorrect according to the problem description.
