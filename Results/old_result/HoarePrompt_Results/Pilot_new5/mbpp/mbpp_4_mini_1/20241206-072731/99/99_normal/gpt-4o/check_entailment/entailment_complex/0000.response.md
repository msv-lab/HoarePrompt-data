Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements in the problem description. The problem states that the function must remove characters with odd index values from a given string. However, the provided function `func_1` instead retains the characters with even index values, effectively producing a string that includes only those characters.

To illustrate this with an example:
- For the input string `'abcdef'`, the characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5) are 'b', 'd', and 'f', which should be removed. The expected output according to the problem description would be `'ace'` (keeping 'a', 'c', 'e').
- However, the function defined does return `'ace'` because it is keeping characters at even indices, which does not fulfill the requirement of "removing characters with odd index values."

Therefore, the function does not align with the problem description's requirement of removing characters at odd indices, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
