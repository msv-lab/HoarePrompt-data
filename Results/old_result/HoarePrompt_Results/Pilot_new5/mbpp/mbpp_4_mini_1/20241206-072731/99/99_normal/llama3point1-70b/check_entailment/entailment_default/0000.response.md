The provided Python program `func_1(s)` is designed to remove characters from a string that have odd index values. It correctly constructs a new string by concatenating every second character from the original string, starting from index 0.

1. **Initial Assessment**: 
   - The logic used in the code is to iterate over the string with a step of 2, effectively selecting characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This matches the problem description as it requires removing characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...). Therefore, it seems to implement the described functionality correctly.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - An important edge case to consider is when the input string is empty. The program correctly handles this case as it would return an empty string when no characters are present.
   - Another edge case would be a single-character string. In this case, the output would be the same single character since the only index (0) is even.

3. **Output Hints Verification**:
   - The output hints state that the function returns a new string formed by concatenating every second character from `s`, starting from the first character (index 0). This aligns perfectly with the function's logic.
   - It also mentions that if `s` is empty, the function returns an empty string, which is consistent with the expected behavior of the code.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Upon reviewing the code and the output hints, there are no discrepancies or missing logic. The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, including edge cases like empty strings and single-character strings.

Correctness: **True**.
