Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function that takes a list of lists (where each sublist contains strings) and returns a new list of lists, with each sublist sorted in a case-insensitive manner. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is explicitly stated as a list of lists containing strings in the comment. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sorting Mechanism**: The use of `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` ensures that the sorting is done in a case-insensitive manner, which is a key requirement mentioned in the annotations.

3. **Output Structure**: The function returns a new list containing the sorted sublists while preserving the empty sublists (if any) from the original input. This is important because the problem description does not mention modifying the original list structure.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles empty sublists by returning them unchanged in the final output, which is consistent with the annotations.

Thus, the implementation fulfills all aspects of the problem description, and there are no cases where it would fail to meet the requirements.
