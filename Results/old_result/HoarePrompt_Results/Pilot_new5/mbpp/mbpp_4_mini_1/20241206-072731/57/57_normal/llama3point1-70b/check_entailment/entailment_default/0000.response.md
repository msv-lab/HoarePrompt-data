Upon reviewing the problem description and the provided code, the function is intended to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in a case-insensitive manner. The code uses Python's `sorted()` function with `key=str.lower` to achieve case-insensitive sorting. This implies that it should sort strings regardless of their case.

The code provided appears to do this correctly. For example, if the input is `[['banana', 'Apple', 'cherry'], ['date', 'fig']]`, the expected output would be `[['Apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], ['date', 'fig']]`. The function also handles empty sublists correctly by returning them unchanged.

Now, examining the output hints, they confirm that the implementation accepts a list of lists and maintains the structure of the input while sorting each sublist case-insensitively. It explicitly states that empty sublists remain empty in the output, which the provided code adheres to.

Thinking about edge cases, the only potential scenarios could involve:
1. Empty input: An empty list of lists should return an empty list.
2. Mixed case strings: The code appears to handle this correctly.
3. Completely empty sublists within the list of lists: The function should return the same empty sublists.

We can verify whether the code works for these edge cases:
- An input of `[[], []]` would correctly return `[[], []]`.
- An input of `[]` would return `[]`.

Considering these points, there does not seem to be any case where the function would fail based on the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**.

The function sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner while maintaining the original structure of the input list of lists, and it correctly handles empty sublists or empty input as specified in the problem description.
