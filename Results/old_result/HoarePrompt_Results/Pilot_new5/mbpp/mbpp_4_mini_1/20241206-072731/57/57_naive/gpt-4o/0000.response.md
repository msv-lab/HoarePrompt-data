Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the strings in the sublists have leading or trailing spaces. For example, the expected output for the input `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])` is `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`. However, the program's use of the `sorted` function will sort the strings such that the strings with spaces are incorrectly ordered relative to those without spaces. 

Additionally, for the input `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])`, the expected output is `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. The program incorrectly sorts the third list into `['black', 'orange', 'white']`, which is also not what was expected. 

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every case.
