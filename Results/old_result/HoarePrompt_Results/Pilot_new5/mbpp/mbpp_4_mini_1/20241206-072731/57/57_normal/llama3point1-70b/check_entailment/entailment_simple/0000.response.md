Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (where each sublist contains strings) and sorts each sublist in a case-insensitive manner. 

Here’s a breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts `list_of_lists`, which is specified to be a list of lists of strings. This matches the problem description.

2. **Sorting Mechanism**: The program uses the `sorted()` function to sort the elements of each sublist. The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is done in a case-insensitive manner, which is a proper approach to meet the requirement of sorting strings correctly regardless of their casing.

3. **Return Type**: The function returns a new list where each sublist is sorted. This is precisely what the problem description asks for—sorting each sublist.

Overall, the logic and implementation align perfectly with the task described, ensuring that it will handle all potential cases that involve sorting lists of strings. Thus, the program always fulfills the requirement of sorting each sublist as specified.
