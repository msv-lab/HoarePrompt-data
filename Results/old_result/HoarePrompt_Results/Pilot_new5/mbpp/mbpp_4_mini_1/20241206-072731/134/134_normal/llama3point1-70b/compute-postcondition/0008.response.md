According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently 1 and can range from 0 to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. So when the next iteration starts, `i` will be 2. Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 2 (to allow `i` to be less than or equal to `n`).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to 1 if `i` is odd (which it is), `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
