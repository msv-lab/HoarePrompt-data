According to the code, the loop executes for values of `i` starting from 0 up to and including `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. The initial state of `sum` being 0 does not affect the loop's execution, but it will be affected during the loop's iterations.

At the beginning of the loop:
- `i` starts at 0 (the first value in the range) and will increment by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
- `i` should be initialized to 0 before the first iteration starts.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
