Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the specified functionality of checking whether two integers differ by exactly one bit position. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Bitwise XOR Operation**: The function uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to compare `num1` and `num2`. The XOR operation results in a binary number where each bit is set to `1` if the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` are different. If the XOR results in a number that has exactly one bit set to `1`, it indicates that the two numbers differ at one bit position.

2. **Counting Set Bits**: The program converts the result of the XOR operation to its binary representation using `bin()`, and then counts the number of `1`s using `count('1')`. If there is exactly one `1`, it confirms that `num1` and `num2` differ by exactly one bit.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the count of `1`s is exactly one, and `False` otherwise, which aligns perfectly with the requirement laid out in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**: The implementation handles edge cases correctly, such as when the two numbers are the same (returns `False`) or when both numbers are negative or zero, as the XOR operation and counting of bits will function correctly in those cases too.

Overall, the program meets all the conditions outlined in the problem description, thus confirming its correctness.
