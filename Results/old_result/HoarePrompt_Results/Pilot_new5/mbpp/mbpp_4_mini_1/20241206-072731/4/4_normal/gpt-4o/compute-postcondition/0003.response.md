The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`. It performs a bitwise XOR operation on these two integers, resulting in `xor_result`. The function then checks whether `xor_result` is not equal to zero and whether it is a power of two. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

It is important to note that the function does not explicitly handle any edge cases for negative integers or the scenario where both `a` and `b` are the same, leading to `xor_result` being `0`. In these situations, the function would return `False`, which is consistent with its logic but not discussed in the annotations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns `True` if the result of the XOR operation between them is a power of two and not zero; otherwise, it returns `False`. **
