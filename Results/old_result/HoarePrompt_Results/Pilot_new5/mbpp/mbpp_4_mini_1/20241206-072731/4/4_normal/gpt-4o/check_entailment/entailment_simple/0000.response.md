Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` checks whether two numbers differ at only one bit position. Hereâ€™s how it does that:

1. **XOR Operation**: The expression `a ^ b` computes the bitwise XOR of the two numbers. The result of the XOR operation will have bits set to `1` only in positions where the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` differ.

2. **Check for Non-Zero Result**: The condition `xor_result != 0` ensures that there is at least one bit that differs between `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `xor_result` will be `0`, which indicates that they do not differ at all.

3. **Check for a Single Bit Difference**: The condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if `xor_result` is a power of two. A number is a power of two if it has exactly one `1` bit in its binary representation. This indicates that there is only one bit position where `a` and `b` differ.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if both conditions are satisfied, meaning that `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position, and `False` otherwise.

The assertions provided in the program validate the correctness of the function for various input cases, reinforcing that it behaves as expected according to the problem description. Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem statement.
