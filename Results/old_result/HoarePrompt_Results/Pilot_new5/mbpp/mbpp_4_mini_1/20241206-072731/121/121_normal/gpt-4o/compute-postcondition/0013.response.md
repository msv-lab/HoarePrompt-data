To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's logic step by step, using the initial state and the details provided from the previous output states.

1. The loop begins with `S0` and `S1` set to 1.
2. With each iteration, a new `S_next` is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0`.
3. Then, `S0` and `S1` are updated, where `S0` takes the value of the previous `S1` and `S1` takes the value of `S_next`.
4. The loop executes as long as `i` ranges from 2 to `n`, inclusive.

Given the outputs after a few iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `S0` becomes 1 and `S1` becomes 3.
- After 2 iterations, `S0` becomes 3 and `S1` becomes 7.
- After 3 iterations, `S0` becomes 7 and `S1` becomes 17.

Continuing this pattern, we can deduce the values of `S0` and `S1` after 4 iterations:
- For `i = 4`: 
  - `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0 = 2 * 17 + 7 = 41`
  - After this iteration, `S0` becomes 17 (the previous `S1`), and `S1` becomes 41.

Since the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, the final values after all iterations will depend on `n`. We can summarize:

- If the loop executes `n-1` times (which is possible since `n` is at least 2), `S0` will hold the value of `S1` from the previous iteration (which is the value computed in the last iteration) and `S1` will hold the value calculated in the last iteration.

Thus, after `n-1` iterations, `S0` and `S1` will have the last computed values in the series.

Output State: **`S0` is the value of `S1` from the last iteration, `S1` is the value computed in the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1.**
