`S_next` is assigned the value `2 * S1 + S0`. Given the initial values, `S1` is `1` and `S0` is `1`, so `S_next` will be calculated as `2 * 1 + 1`, which equals `3`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, and `S_next` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**
