In the given code snippet, the values of `S0` and `S1` are assigned based on the current values. Specifically, `S0` takes the value of `S1`, and `S1` takes the value of `S_next`. 

Initially:
- `S0` is 3
- `S1` is 7
- `S_next` is 17

After executing the code:
- `S0` becomes the previous value of `S1`, which is 7.
- `S1` becomes the previous value of `S_next`, which is 17.

The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 7, `S1` is 17, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
