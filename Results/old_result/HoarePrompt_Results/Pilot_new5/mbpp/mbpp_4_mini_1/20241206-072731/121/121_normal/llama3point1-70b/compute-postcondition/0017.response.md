The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions still apply, so `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, `num` is 8, `func_1(num)` returns true, `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, `count` is 3, `num` is 8, if `func_1(num)` returns true, then `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
