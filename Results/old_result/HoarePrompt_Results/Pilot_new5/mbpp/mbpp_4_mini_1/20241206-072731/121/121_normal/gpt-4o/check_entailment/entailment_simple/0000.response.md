Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. 

The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers defined by a particular formula, and the correct implementation would need to generate the sequence of these primes. The program currently calculates a sequence based on a recurrence relation (specifically, it computes a form of the Fibonacci-like sequence) but does not check for primality or relate the results to the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers.

The assertions that check for values `7`, `17`, and `41` relate to known Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, but the method used to compute these primes is incorrect. The function returns `1` for `n=0` or `n=1`, and does not generate the next primes in the sequence for larger values of `n`.

To be correct, the function must specifically generate and return the nth prime from the sequence defined by the specific properties of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, which is not achieved in the current implementation.
