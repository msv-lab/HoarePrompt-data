According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `i` values starting from 2 up to `n`, inclusive. Since `n` is specified to be greater than 1, the loop will execute at least once.

Before the loop starts, `S0` and `S1` are both initialized to 1, but those values don't impact the execution of the loop itself. The key points to note are the initialization of `i` and the range defined by `n`. On the first iteration, `i` should start at 2.

Thus, for the loop to be executed the states need to confirm that `n` is indeed greater than 1, and `i` should be initialized to 2 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2**
