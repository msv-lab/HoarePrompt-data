The value of `num` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 7 to 8. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, if `func_1(num)` returns true, then `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, `count` is 2, `num` is 8, if `func_1(num)` returns true, then `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
