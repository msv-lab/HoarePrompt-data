The code `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` simultaneously assigns the value of `S1` to `S0` and the value of `S_next` to `S1`. 

Here are the previous values of the affected variables:
- `S0` was `1`
- `S1` was `1`
- `S_next` is `3`

Now, after executing the code:
- `S0` will be assigned the value of `S1`, which is `1`.
- `S1` will be assigned the value of `S_next`, which is `3`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is: 
- `n` is greater than 1
- `S0` is now `1` (unchanged)
- `S1` is now `3`
- `i` is `2`
- `S_next` is `3`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**
