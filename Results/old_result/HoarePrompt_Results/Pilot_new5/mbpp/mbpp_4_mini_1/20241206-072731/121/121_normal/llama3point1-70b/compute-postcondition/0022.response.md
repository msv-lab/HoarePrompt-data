The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num` was 8, so now `num` becomes 9. The other variables `n`, `count`, and the return behavior of the function remain unchanged and still hold their previous respective states. Specifically, `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, and `count` remains at 3. Since the function does not return any value after this increment, we note that the potential return condition is still valid but has not been met.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n > 1`, `count` is 3, `num` is 9**.
