Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, upon analyzing the code, it is clear that the function `func_1(n)` does not implement the logic to determine prime numbers correctly. Instead, it seems to generate a sequence based on the recurrence relation of the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers, which are not prime numbers.

For example, when calling `func_1(3)`, the assertion expects the result to be 7 (which is indeed a prime), but the actual implementation yields the third term of the sequence, which is not verified to be a prime. The implementation lacks any logic to validate whether the computed numbers are indeed prime or to specifically generate Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

Additionally, if we compute the first few terms using the algorithm, we do not get the expected prime outputs. For instance:

- func_1(0) returns 1 (not a prime)
- func_1(1) returns 1 (not a prime)
- func_1(2) returns 3 (which is prime, but not one of the expected primes)
- func_1(3) returns 7 (which is prime, but still not validated)
- func_1(4) returns 17 (which is prime, validated in assertion)
- func_1(5) returns 41 (which is prime, validated in assertion)

The function does not cover all edge cases and fails to generate the correct sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes as required by the problem statement.

Hence, there are cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
