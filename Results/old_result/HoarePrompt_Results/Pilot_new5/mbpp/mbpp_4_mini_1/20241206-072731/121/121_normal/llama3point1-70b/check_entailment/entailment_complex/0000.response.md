Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number for all potential cases. 

### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function checks if a number `n` is prime. It correctly returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and uses trial division for greater numbers. The logic here is sound and matches the intention of checking for primality.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function is intended to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
   - It correctly returns `7` when `n == 1`.
   - For `n > 1`, it uses a loop to find subsequent primes that are congruent to `1` or `5` modulo `6`.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the infinite loop. If `func_1(num)` does not find a prime congruent to `1` or `5` for very large values of `num`, the loop could potentially run indefinitely, leading to a scenario where the function does not return a valid prime number.

### Missing Edge Cases:
- The function does not account for scenarios where the search for nth Newman-Shanks-Williams primes could lead to an infinite loop if no primes are found that meet the criteria.
- Additionally, there could be cases where `n` is significantly large but the function fails to find the nth prime within reasonable time due to the efficiency of `func_1` or an overwhelming number of iterations without a valid output.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the specified task correctly in every case, leading to an overall conclusion of incorrectness.
