According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop starts at `i = 2` and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is currently 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 7**
