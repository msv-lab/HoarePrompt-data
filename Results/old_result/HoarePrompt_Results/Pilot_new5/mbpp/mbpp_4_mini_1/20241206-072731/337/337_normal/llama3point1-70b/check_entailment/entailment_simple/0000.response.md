Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and calculates the sum of the elements that appear exactly once in that list.

Here's an explanation of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list of integers (`lst`), which aligns with the expected input type described in the problem.

2. **Identifying Non-Repeated Elements**: The program uses a generator expression that iterates over each element `i` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if `lst.count(i) == 1`, meaning it counts how many times `i` appears in the list and includes it in the sum only if it appears exactly once. This directly fulfills the requirement to find non-repeated elements.

3. **Summation**: The `sum()` function then calculates the total of these non-repeated elements, providing the final output that the function is supposed to deliver.

4. **Correctness Across Cases**: The program handles various cases correctly:
   - If all elements are repeated, it returns 0.
   - If there are some unique elements, it correctly sums only those.
   - If the list is empty, it also correctly returns 0.

Overall, the program is a faithful implementation of the problem description, ensuring the correct sum of non-repeated elements in the given list.
