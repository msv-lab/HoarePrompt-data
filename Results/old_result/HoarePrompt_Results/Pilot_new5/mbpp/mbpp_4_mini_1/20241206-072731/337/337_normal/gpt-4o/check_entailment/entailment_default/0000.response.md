The problem description states that the function should find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the provided code uses `sum(set(lst))`, which calculates the sum of all unique elements in the list, regardless of whether they are repeated or not. 

Let's analyze this further:

- The example `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` should return the sum of non-repeated elements, which are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`. The correct answer should be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`, but the code returns `21` since it sums all unique values `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.
- The example `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` should sum the non-repeated elements `1`, `9`, `2`, and `45`. The correct answer should be `1 + 9 + 2 + 45 = 57`, but the code returns `71`.
- The example `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` should sum the non-repeated elements `12` and `2`. The correct answer should be `12 + 2 = 14`, but the code returns `78`.

From the analysis, the code fails to follow the problem description as it does not accurately calculate the sum of non-repeated elements, leading to incorrect results for multiple cases.

Now, let's check the output hints. The hints mention that the function returns the sum of unique integers in the list. This agrees with the behavior of the code but contradicts the problem description, which specifies that we need the sum of non-repeated elements.

Given these inconsistencies, we can conclude that the function does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, particularly where elements are repeated.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function incorrectly calculates the sum of unique integers instead of the sum of non-repeated elements, leading to incorrect results for the provided examples. For instance, in the first example with the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the sum should be `20`, but the function returns `21`.
