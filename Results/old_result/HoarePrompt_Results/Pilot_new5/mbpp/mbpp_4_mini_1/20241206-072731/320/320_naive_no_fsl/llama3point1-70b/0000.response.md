Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` first converts the input list `nums` into a set to remove any duplicates, and then it converts it back to a list called `unique_nums`.
2. It checks if there are fewer than two unique numbers. If so, it returns `None`, which is valid according to the problem description since we cannot find a second smallest number in such cases.
3. If there are at least two unique numbers, it sorts `unique_nums` and returns the second element (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`), which is indeed the second smallest number.

The handling of edge cases, such as lists with fewer than two unique elements or lists with duplicates, is correctly implemented. Therefore, I cannot find any potential cases where the code fails to meet the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
