Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`nums`) that is guaranteed to contain at least two distinct elements, as stated in the annotated program. This means that the program does not need to handle cases where there are fewer than two distinct numbers, as it assumes this condition is always met.

2. **Unique Elements**: The program uses `set(nums)` to create a set of unique integers from the list. This effectively removes any duplicates. The program then converts this set back to a list (`unique_nums`).

3. **Second Smallest Element**: The program checks if `unique_nums` has fewer than two elements. However, based on the problem description and the annotated explanation, the program assumes that it will have at least two unique elements due to the given conditions. Thus, it directly proceeds to sort `unique_nums` and access the second element (index 1) of the sorted list, which corresponds to the second smallest unique integer.

4. **Return Value**: The final return statement (`return sorted(unique_nums)[1]`) returns the second smallest number as required by the problem description.

Since the program operates under the condition that the input list will always contain at least two distinct integers, it correctly fulfills the requirement of finding the second smallest number in such a list.

In conclusion, the program is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem description without any issues or exceptions that would lead to incorrect behavior.
