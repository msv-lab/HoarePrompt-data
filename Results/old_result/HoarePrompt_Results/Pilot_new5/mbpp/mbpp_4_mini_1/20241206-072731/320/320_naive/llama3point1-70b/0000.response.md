Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. **Unique Numbers**: The program uses `set(nums)` to eliminate duplicates, ensuring that only unique numbers are considered when finding the second smallest.
2. **Length Check**: It checks if there are at least two unique numbers. If there are fewer than two, it correctly returns `None`.
3. **Sorting**: The use of `sorted(unique_nums)[1]` accurately retrieves the second smallest number from the sorted list of unique numbers.

It handles various cases:
- If the input list has fewer than two unique elements, it returns `None`.
- If there are at least two unique numbers, it correctly identifies the second smallest number.

Overall, the function adheres to the problem description and performs as expected for all potential cases.
