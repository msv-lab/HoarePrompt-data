Correctness: **False**.

The provided program uses a selection sort-like approach and reverses segments of the array to sort it. However, there are several cases where this implementation fails to sort the list correctly. 

For example, consider the input list `arr = [3, 2, 1]`. The logic will attempt to reverse segments, but it will not result in the correctly sorted list `[1, 2, 3]`. 

Let's break down the steps for this input:
1. The maximum in the initial full list `[3, 2, 1]` is `3`, which is at index `0`. It will reverse the first segment, but the whole list is not reversed correctly in subsequent operations.
2. The logic does not correctly handle cases where multiple elements need to be reversed multiple times to achieve the correct order.

Thus, since there are cases where the program does not achieve the output as described in the problem statement, it is incorrect.
