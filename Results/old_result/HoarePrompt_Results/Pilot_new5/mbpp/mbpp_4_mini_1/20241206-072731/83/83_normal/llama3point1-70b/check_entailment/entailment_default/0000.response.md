The provided code is intended to sort a list of elements using a selection sort-like algorithm. Let's analyze the code based on the problem description and output hints.

### Code Analysis
1. **Sorting Logic**: 
   - The function starts with the full array and iteratively finds the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list.
   - It reverses the segment of the list up to the maximum element's index, then reverses the entire unsorted portion.
   - This technique is somewhat reminiscent of selection sort, but the reversing approach may lead to incorrect placements of elements, especially if the maximum is not at the end of the considered segment. 

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty, the function will return it unchanged, which is correct.
   - However, if the list contains duplicate elements or sorted elements, it's unclear how the reversing operation will manage their order correctly.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic of selecting the maximum and reversing does not guarantee that the entire list will be sorted correctly. For example, with an input of `[3, 1, 2]`, the function will not necessarily sort correctly because the method is based on reversing sections rather than comparing and positioning elements properly.
   - When duplicate maximum elements exist, the behavior of the index-based operation may cause unintended results.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function sorts the list in non-decreasing order and modifies the input list in-place while returning the sorted list. However, it does not clarify how the function handles lists with duplicate values. 

### Conclusion
The algorithm in the code does not ensure a sorted order for all possible inputs, particularly in situations involving duplicates or specific arrangements that require more nuanced sorting logic. 

Thus, given that there are cases where the function does not work as intended (e.g., it may fail to sort `[3, 1, 2]` correctly), we must conclude that the implementation does not meet the requirements of correctly sorting the list for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
