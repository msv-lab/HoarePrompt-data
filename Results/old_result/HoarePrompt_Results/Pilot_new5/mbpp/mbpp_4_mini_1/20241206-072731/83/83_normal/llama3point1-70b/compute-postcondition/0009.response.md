According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size` which starts at `n` and decrements down to 1. The loop will execute again as long as `size` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is `n` (greater than 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `size` will decrease by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `size` will be `n - 1`.

Since `max_index` is not relevant for the loop execution but rather for the conditions within the loop, we need to keep the other states intact except for the change in `size`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, `n` is greater than 0, and `size` is `n - 1`**
