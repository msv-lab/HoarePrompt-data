`max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The initial conditions state that `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements, `max_index` is initially 0, and `i` is 1. Since the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than the value of `arr[max_index]`, it means that `arr[1]` is greater than `arr[0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of elements with at least `n` elements, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `arr[1]` is greater than the current value of `arr[0]`.**
