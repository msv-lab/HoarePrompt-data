The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. Therefore, `max_index` changes from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is 3, `max_index` is 3**
