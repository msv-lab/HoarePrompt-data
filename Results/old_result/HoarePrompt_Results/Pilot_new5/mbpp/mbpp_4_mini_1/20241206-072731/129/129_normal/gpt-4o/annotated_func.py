#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the integer value representing the Unicode code point of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns the integer value representing the Unicode code point of that character. It does not handle cases where `char` is not a single character string, which could lead to unexpected behavior if an invalid input is provided.
