Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the function `func_1` to find the ASCII value of a character using the built-in `ord()` function in Python. The assertions provided test specific characters ('A', 'R', and 'S') and check if their ASCII values are returned correctly.

The `ord()` function handles all valid single-character inputs according to the problem description. For any valid input character, the function will return the corresponding ASCII value. Edge cases such as empty strings, non-character inputs (e.g., integers, lists), and multi-character strings are not part of the problem description, which specifically asks for a single character. Since the function performs correctly for all valid input cases that align with the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.

Thus, I cannot find any potential cases where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
