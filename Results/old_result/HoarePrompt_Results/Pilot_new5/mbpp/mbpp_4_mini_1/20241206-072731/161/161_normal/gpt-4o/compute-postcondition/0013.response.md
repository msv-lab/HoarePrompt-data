To analyze the loop, we see that `a` and `b` undergo updates in each iteration based on their previous values. The loop iterates from `2` to `n + 1`, meaning it will execute `n - 1` times given that `n` is greater than `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than `1`
- `a` starts at `2`
- `b` starts at `1`

During each iteration:
- The current value of `a` becomes the previous value of `b`.
- The current value of `b` becomes the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`.

After the loop executes:
1. After 1 iteration:
   - `_` is `2`
   - `a` is `1` (previous value of `b`)
   - `b` is `3` (sum of `2` and `1`)
2. After 2 iterations:
   - `_` is `3`
   - `a` is `3` (previous value of `b`)
   - `b` is `4` (sum of `1` and `3`)
3. After 3 iterations:
   - `_` is `4`
   - `a` is `4` (previous value of `b`)
   - `b` is `7` (sum of `3` and `4`)

Continuing this until all iterations complete, we can see that `b` ends up being the sum of the previous two values of `b` and `a` based on the Fibonacci-like relation established by the updates.

After `n - 1` iterations, we have:
- `a` will be the value of `b` just before the final update.
- `b` will be the Fibonacci number corresponding to `n + 1` since it is essentially following the Fibonacci relation starting from `a = 2` and `b = 1`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop:
- `a` is the Fibonacci number at position `n` (which corresponds to `F(n)`).
- `b` is the Fibonacci number at position `n + 1` (which corresponds to `F(n + 1)`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is the Fibonacci number F(n), `b` is the Fibonacci number F(n + 1).**
