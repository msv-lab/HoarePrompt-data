The code assigns the values `2` to `a` and `1` to `b`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and retains its previous conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2, `b` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2, `b` is 1**.
