According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 2, meaning `n` could be 3 or more. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `_` will become 4. To allow the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4, since the loop condition checks if `_` is less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4; `_` is 4; `a` is the previous value of `b`; `b` is the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`, which is `a + b`.**
