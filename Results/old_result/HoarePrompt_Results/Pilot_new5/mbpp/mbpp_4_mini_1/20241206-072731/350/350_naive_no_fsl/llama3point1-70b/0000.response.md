Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(arr, target)` correctly finds the last position of the specified `target` element in a sorted array `arr`. 

Here's how it works:
1. The function iterates through the array `arr` from the last index to the first index.
2. It checks if the current element is equal to `target`. If it finds a match, it returns the index of that element immediately.
3. If the loop completes without finding the target, it returns `-1`, indicating that the target is not present in the array.

Given that the function returns the index of the last occurrence of the target element, it satisfies the requirement outlined in the problem description. 

Additionally, since the function scans the array in reverse, it is guaranteed to find the last occurrence first if there are multiple occurrences of the target. 

No edge cases or potential input cases were found that would break this functionality. Thus, the function behaves correctly for all possible inputs based on the problem description.
