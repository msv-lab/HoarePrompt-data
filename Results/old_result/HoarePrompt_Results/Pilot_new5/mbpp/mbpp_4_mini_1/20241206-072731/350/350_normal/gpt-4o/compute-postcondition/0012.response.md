The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `x`. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x` is an integer. 

After executing the function body, the function may return different values based on specific conditions:
- Case 1: If certain conditions are met, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to the length of `arr` minus 1, indicating the position of the last element in the sorted list of integers.
- Case 2: If another condition is met, the function returns the value of `i`, which is the length of `arr` minus 2, reflecting the index of the second to last element in the list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Case 3: If the conditions indicate that `arr` has at least 2 elements, the program returns `i`, which is the length of `arr` minus 2, indicating that `arr` has at least 2 elements.
- Case 4: If the value `x` is not found in the list `arr`, the function returns -1, indicating that the search for `x` was unsuccessful.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, and return the appropriate index based on the conditions outlined above, or -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`, returning the index of the last element, the index of the second to last element, the index indicating at least two elements are present, or -1 if `x` is not found in the list.**
