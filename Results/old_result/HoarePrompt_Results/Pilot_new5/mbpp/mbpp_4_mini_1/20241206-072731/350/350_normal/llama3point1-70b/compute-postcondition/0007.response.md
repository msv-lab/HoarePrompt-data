According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `len(arr)`. The loop iterates over the indices of the `arr` from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, which means that in the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, resulting in `i` being `len(arr) - 3`. 

Since the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, and `arr` has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to `len(arr) - 3`, and `arr[i]` will be the element at index `len(arr) - 3`.

Therefore, the states need to be modified as follows:
- `arr` remains a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements.
- `i` becomes `len(arr) - 3`.

The last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`, and since `arr[i]` at the end of the previous iteration is not equal to `target`, we keep that condition.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`**.
