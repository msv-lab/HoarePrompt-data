Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(s)` is designed to remove all whitespaces from a given string `s` by replacing spaces with an empty string. 

The provided assertions test various scenarios:

1. **Single space between words**: `'python  program'` is correctly transformed into `'pythonprogram'`.
2. **Multiple spaces between words**: `'python   programming    language'` is correctly transformed into `'pythonprogramminglanguage'`.
3. **Leading and trailing spaces**: `'   python                     program'` is correctly transformed into `'pythonprogram'`.
4. **Only spaces**: The function handles strings that consist solely of spaces, which would correctly return an empty string (though not explicitly tested in assertions).

The implementation correctly handles all kinds of whitespace present in the input strings, including multiple spaces and spaces at the beginning or end of the string. There is no case where the function would fail to remove all whitespace characters as described.

Thus, there are no potential edge cases where the code fails to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the code is correct.
