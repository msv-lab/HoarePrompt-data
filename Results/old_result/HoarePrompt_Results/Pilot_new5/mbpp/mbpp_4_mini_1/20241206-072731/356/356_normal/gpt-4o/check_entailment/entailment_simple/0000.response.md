Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function must remove all whitespaces from a string, but the implementation only removes spaces (i.e., the character ' '). This means that any other types of whitespace characters, such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or multiple spaces, are not removed by the function. Therefore, the function does not correctly handle all cases of whitespace as specified in the problem description.

For example, the input string `'python\tprogram'` or `'python\nprogram'` would not have the whitespace removed properly with the current implementation. Thus, the program fails to satisfy the requirement to remove all types of whitespace from the string.
