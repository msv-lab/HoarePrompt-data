Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements between two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
  
2. **Implementation Details**:
   - It converts both lists into sets using `set(test_tup1)` and `set(test_tup2)`. This ensures that only unique elements from each list are considered for the intersection.
   - The intersection of the two sets is computed using the `&` operator, which results in another set containing only the elements that are present in both sets.
   - Finally, this intersection set is converted back to a tuple using `tuple(...)`.

3. **Return Value**: 
   - If there are common elements between the two lists, the function returns a tuple containing those shared elements.
   - If there are no common elements, the intersection will be an empty set, and converting it to a tuple will yield an empty tuple `()`.

4. **Correctness Against Problem Description**:
   - The code adheres to the requirements of the problem description by returning a tuple of shared elements.
   - It correctly handles all potential cases, including when there are no shared elements by returning an empty tuple.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description in all scenarios, confirming its correctness.
