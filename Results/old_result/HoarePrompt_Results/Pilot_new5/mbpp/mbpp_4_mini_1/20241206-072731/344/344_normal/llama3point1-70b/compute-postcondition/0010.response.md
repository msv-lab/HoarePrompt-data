Output State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list`, and if `value` is not found in `sorted_list`, it is greater than the last element of `sorted_list`. If `value` is found, `i` would be the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If the list is empty, then `i` is 0.**
