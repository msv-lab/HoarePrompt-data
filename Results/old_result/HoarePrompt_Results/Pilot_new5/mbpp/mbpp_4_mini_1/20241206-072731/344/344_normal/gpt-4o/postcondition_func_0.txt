The function accepts a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order (`sorted_list`) and an integer (`value`). It returns the index at which `value` can be inserted into `sorted_list` while maintaining the order. If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, it returns the length of the list, indicating the position at the end. If `value` is smaller than or equal to the first element, it returns 0, indicating the position at the start. This behavior ensures that the insertion point is correctly identified for any integer value.
