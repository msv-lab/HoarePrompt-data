Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The purpose of the function `func_1` is to locate the appropriate insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which correctly identifies the index at which the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the insertion point for a value in a sorted list, which is precisely what the problem description asks for.

2. **Use of bisect.bisect_right**: The method `bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)` returns the index of the rightmost position in the `sorted_list` where the `value` can be inserted while keeping the list sorted. This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement to locate the right insertion point.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for various test cases:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and `6`, it returns `4`, which is the correct index for insertion.
   - For `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and `3`, it returns `2`, again the correct insertion index.
   - For `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and `7`, it returns `4`, which is correct.

Since the implementation accurately adheres to the problem requirements in all specified cases, the program is deemed correct.
