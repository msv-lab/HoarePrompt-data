According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sorted_list`. The loop will execute once for each index in the range of the length of `sorted_list`. If `sorted_list` is not empty, the loop will have indices from 0 to `len(sorted_list) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `sorted_list` must have at least 1 integer. Additionally, before the loop starts, the variable `i` is not initialized, so it should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0**
