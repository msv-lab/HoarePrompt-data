Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. While the function does locate the right insertion point in most cases, it fails to handle the cases where the value is less than the first element in the sorted list correctly.

1. If the `value` is less than the first element of the `sorted_list`, the function will not return the correct index, as there are no checks for this scenario. According to the problem description, if the value is less than all elements in the list, it should return `0`, which it does if the list is empty. However, if the list contains elements and the value is less than the first element, the program does not have a mechanism to handle this correctly and will mistakenly return `0` without indicating the correct insertion index.

2. The annotations suggest that the function handles the case where `value` is found in the `sorted_list` or greater than the last element correctly, but it does not specify that it properly identifies the condition where the `value` could be less than the first element.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirement to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
