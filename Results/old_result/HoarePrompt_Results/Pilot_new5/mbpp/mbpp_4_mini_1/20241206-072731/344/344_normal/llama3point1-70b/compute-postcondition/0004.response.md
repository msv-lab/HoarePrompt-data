According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `sorted_list` and the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `sorted_list` has at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, the length of `sorted_list` must be greater than `i`. Since `i` is now 1, `sorted_list` must have at least 2 integers.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1, and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`.**
