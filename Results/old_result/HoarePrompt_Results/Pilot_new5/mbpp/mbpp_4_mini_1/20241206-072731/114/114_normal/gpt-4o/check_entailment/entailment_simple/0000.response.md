Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it adheres to the problem description requirements. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and it counts the occurrences of `element` in the tuple using the built-in `count()` method of the tuple. This is exactly what the problem description specifies.

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a tuple (which is explicitly stated in the problem description) and an element (which can be of any data type). This aligns with the requirements.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The line `return tup.count(element)` correctly uses the `count()` method, which counts the number of times `element` appears in `tup`. This functionality fulfills the requirement of counting occurrences in the tuple.

3. **Test Cases**: The test assertions provided validate the functionality:
   - The first assertion checks for an element (4) that does not exist in the tuple, expecting a count of 0.
   - The second assertion checks for an element (10) that appears 3 times, expecting a count of 3.
   - The third assertion checks for an element (8) that appears 4 times, expecting a count of 4.

Given that the function performs as described for all potential cases and the built-in `count()` method is accurate for counting occurrences, we conclude that the implementation is functionally correct.
