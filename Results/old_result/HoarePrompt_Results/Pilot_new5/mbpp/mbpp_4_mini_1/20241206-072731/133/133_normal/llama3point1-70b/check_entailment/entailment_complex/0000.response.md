Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and computes the element-wise differences of their corresponding elements using Python's `zip` function. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Requirement:** The function accepts two tuples, which is in accordance with the requirement of the problem description.
2. **Element-wise Operation:** The use of a generator expression within `tuple()` and `zip()` effectively iterates through both tuples simultaneously. For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), it subtracts the second element from the first.
3. **Output Requirement:** The function returns a new tuple that contains the results of these subtractions, which matches the expected output as stated in the problem description.

While the function does assume that both tuples are of the same length and does not handle cases where they are not (which would raise a `ValueError`), this limitation was not specified in the problem description. Therefore, as long as the two tuples are of the same length (which is an implicit assumption), the function will always work correctly according to the problem requirements.

Hence, it is correct to conclude that the program meets the requirements set out in the problem description without any logical flaws.
