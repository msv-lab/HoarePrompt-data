The function `func_1` is designed to take two tuples and subtract the elements of the first tuple (`tup1`) by the elements of the second tuple (`tup2`) at the same index. The code correctly implements this by using the `zip` function to pair elements of the two tuples and a generator expression to compute the differences.

However, the output hints indicate that the function assumes both tuples are of equal length and does not handle cases where they are not. If the tuples are of different lengths, the `zip` function will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple, which means elements in the longer tuple will be ignored, leading to a potential logical error depending on the expected behavior. In such a case, a `ValueError` is not directly raised, which contradicts the expectation outlined in the output hints.

Furthermore, if the tuples are of unequal length, we do not see any explicit error handling. Thus, the absence of any safeguard for tuple length inconsistency could lead to unexpected results or logic errors in the implementation.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases because it does not account for the scenario where the input tuples are of differing lengths.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program should explicitly handle cases where `tup1` and `tup2` are of differing lengths and raise a `ValueError` as hinted in the output.
