Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes three lists of integers as input parameters (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`), which aligns with the problem description that specifies the merging of three lists.

2. **Combining Lists**: It combines these three lists into a single list using the `+` operator, effectively merging them.

3. **Sorting**: After combining, it sorts the resulting list using the built-in `sorted()` function. This step ensures that the final list is in sorted order, as required.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the sorted list, which is the expected output according to the problem description.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as intended with various input scenarios, producing the correct sorted lists in each case. 

Although the function does not explicitly handle edge cases like empty lists or non-integer values, it inherently allows empty lists (which would simply result in an empty sorted list) and works correctly with the assumption that the inputs will be lists of integers, as stated in the annotations.

Thus, the function fulfills the problem description's requirement to merge three lists into a single sorted list effectively.
