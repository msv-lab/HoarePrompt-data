Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which specifies that the function should merge three lists into a single sorted list. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Concatenation of Lists**: The function `func_1` takes three lists as input (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) and concatenates them into a single list, `combined_list`. This step ensures that all elements from the three lists are included.

2. **Sorting**: The function then sorts the combined list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. This function reliably sorts the list in ascending order, which is the desired output as per the problem statement.

3. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the sorted list, which meets the requirement of producing a single sorted list from the three input lists.

Multiple assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for a variety of cases, including lists with duplicate elements and varying lengths. Since all tests pass and the implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description, we conclude that the function is correct.
