#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements, and can be nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list`, containing all non-list elements from `nested_list`, and nested lists are processed by `func_1`. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains empty.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of `nested_list`, containing all non-list elements from `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a potentially nested list `nested_list` and returns a new list `flat_list` that contains all the non-list elements from `nested_list` in a flattened structure. If `nested_list` contains nested lists, those are recursively processed to extract their non-list elements. If `nested_list` is empty, the returned `flat_list` will also be empty. The function does not limit the depth of nesting and will handle any level of nested lists correctly.
