To verify the correctness of the function `func_1`, we need to consider various edge cases and scenarios that the function must handle to meet the requirements of flattening a nested list structure.

1. **Basic Examples**: The assertions provided in the program use a few nested lists and seem to validate the behavior of the function for those cases. They appear to produce the expected output.
  
2. **Empty List**: An important edge case is an empty list. The function should return an empty list when given an empty nested list, for example:
   ```python
   assert func_1([]) == []
   ```

3. **Deeply Nested Lists**: The function should handle deeply nested lists correctly. For example:
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, [2, [3, [4]], 5], 6]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

4. **Single Element Lists**: A single element nested list should also be handled properly:
   ```python
   assert func_1([[1]]) == [1]
   ```

5. **Mixed Data Types**: The function should handle lists with mixed data types, including numbers and strings:
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, ['a', ['b', 2], 3], 'c']) == [1, 'a', 'b', 2, 3, 'c']
   ```

6. **Non-list Elements**: The function should also be able to handle non-list elements in the nested list:
   ```python
   assert func_1(['hello', [1, [2, 'world'], 3], 4]) == ['hello', 1, 2, 'world', 3, 4]
   ```

Based on the above considerations, we can see that the original function `func_1` does indeed correctly flatten nested lists in the provided examples. It also appears to handle edge cases appropriately, such as empty lists and deeply nested lists.

Since I cannot find any potential case where the function fails to flatten a nested list structure as described in the problem, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
