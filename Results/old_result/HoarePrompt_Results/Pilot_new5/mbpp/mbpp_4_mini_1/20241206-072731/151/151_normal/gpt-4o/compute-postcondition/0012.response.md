The `flat_list` is initially an empty list. The `nested_list` contains at least 3 items, and we are focusing on `item`, which is specifically the third item in `nested_list`. 

The operation `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` applies the function `func_1` to `item` (the third item in `nested_list`), and then extends `flat_list` with the result of that function call. 

The value of `flat_list` will change to include the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. However, without knowing the specific implementation of `func_1` or the contents of `item`, we cannot determine the exact contents that will be added to `flat_list`.

Thus, we can state that `flat_list` now contains the elements generated by `func_1(item)`, while `nested_list` and `item` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(item)`; `nested_list` has at least 3 items; `item` is the third item in `nested_list`.**
