The `flat_list` is assigned the value of `flat_list` extended by the result of `func_1(item)`. Since `flat_list` is initially an empty list, it will be updated to contain the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. The value of `item` is specifically defined as the second item in `nested_list`, which has at least two items. 

Therefore, `flat_list` will now hold the result of `func_1(item)`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`flat_list` is equal to the result of `func_1(item)`, `nested_list` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `nested_list`.**
