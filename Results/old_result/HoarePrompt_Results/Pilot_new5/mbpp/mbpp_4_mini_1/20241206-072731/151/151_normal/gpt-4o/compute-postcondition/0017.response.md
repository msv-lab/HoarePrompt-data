The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, and can be nested to any level. After executing the function body, it returns a flattened version of `nested_list`, which contains all non-list elements from the original list, along with elements returned by the function applied to any sublists. If `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a potentially nested list `nested_list` and return a flattened list containing all non-list elements while handling any level of nesting. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a potentially nested list, and returns a flattened list of all non-list elements. If nested_list is empty, it returns an empty list.**
