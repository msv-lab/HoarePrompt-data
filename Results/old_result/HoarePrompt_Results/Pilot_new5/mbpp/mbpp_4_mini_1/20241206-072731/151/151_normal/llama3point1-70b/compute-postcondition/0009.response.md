The code appends the second element of `nested_list`, which is assigned to `i`, to `flat_list`. Other variables, such as `nested_list`, remain unchanged but retain their previous states. The value of `i` will specifically be the second element of `nested_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `flat_list` has `i` appended to it, and `i` is the second element of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `flat_list` has `i` appended to it, and `i` is the second element of `nested_list`.**
