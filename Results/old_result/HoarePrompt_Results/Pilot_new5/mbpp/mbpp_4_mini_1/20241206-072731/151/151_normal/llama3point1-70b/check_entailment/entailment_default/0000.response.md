To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem description:
The task is to write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function `func_1` is designed to take a potentially nested list and recursively flatten it.
2. It initializes an empty list `flat_list`.
3. It iterates through each item in the `nested_list`:
   - If the item is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` to flatten it and extends `flat_list` with the result.
   - If the item is not a list, it appends the item to `flat_list`.
4. Finally, it returns the flattened list.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty List:** If `nested_list` is empty, the function should return an empty list, which it does.
2. **Mixed Types:** The function only checks if an item is a list. It does not impose any restrictions on the types of non-list items. This behavior seems to match the expected functionality.
3. **Deep Nesting:** The function should handle deep nesting correctly, and it appears to do so according to its recursive structure.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the function should return a flattened list containing all non-list elements and that it can handle any level of nesting. It also states that if `nested_list` is empty, the returned list will also be empty.

### Final Evaluation:
The code appears to match the problem description and the output hints provided. It handles:
- Nested lists of any depth correctly.
- Non-list items are collected properly.
- Returns an empty list for an empty input.

Since I do not see any edge case where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly addresses all specified use cases, including empty lists and deeply nested structures, in accordance with the problem description and the output hints.
