Functionality: ** The function accepts a potentially nested list `nested_list` and returns a new list `flat_list` that contains all the non-list elements from `nested_list` in a flattened structure. If `nested_list` contains nested lists, those are recursively processed to extract their non-list elements. If `nested_list` is empty, the returned `flat_list` will also be empty. The function does not limit the depth of nesting and will handle any level of nested lists correctly. **
