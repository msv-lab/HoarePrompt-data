The function `func_1` is called with `i` as the argument, where `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and is currently a list. The output of `func_1(i)` will be a value that will be extended to `flat_list`. The value of `flat_list` will change based on the result of `func_1(i)`, but without knowing the specific implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list` and `i` is a list; `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(i)`.**
