According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string has more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string containing at least one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is equal to `first_char`. 

Since `char` currently is the first character, we need to increment to the next character for the loop to continue executing. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be the second character in the string `s`, and `s` must have at least 2 characters.

State: **`s` is a string containing at least 2 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s**
