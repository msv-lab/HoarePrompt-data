According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. Since `s` contains at least one character, the loop can execute. The loop will start with `char` being the first character of `s`. Thus, the states need to reflect that `char` is initialized to the first character of `s`, which is already stated as `first_char`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to confirm that `s` is a non-empty string, and that `char` is equal to `first_char`.

State: **`s` is a string containing at least one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is `first_char`**
