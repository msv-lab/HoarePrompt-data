You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('python') == False
assert func_1('aaa') == True
assert func_1('data') == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string containing at least one character.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string containing at least one character, and the condition (not `s`) is false, meaning `s` is not an empty string.
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string containing at least one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all characters in the string 's' are equal to the first character 'first_char'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns True if all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, it returns False. If `s` is empty, the function will not handle this case correctly since the initial condition checks for an empty string does not apply, as the comment indicates that `s` contains at least one character. Thus, the function will always return True if `s` has only one unique character repeated throughout, otherwise it returns False upon finding a different character.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
