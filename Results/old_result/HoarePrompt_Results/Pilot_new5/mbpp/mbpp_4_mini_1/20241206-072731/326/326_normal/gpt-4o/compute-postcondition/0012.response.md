The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`. Therefore, after the assignment, `min_diff` will be equal to the difference between the second and third elements of the sorted list `arr`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]**
