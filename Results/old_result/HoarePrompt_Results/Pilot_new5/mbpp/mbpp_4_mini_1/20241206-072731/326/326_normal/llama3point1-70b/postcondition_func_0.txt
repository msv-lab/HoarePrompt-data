The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the smallest absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of `arr`. If `arr` contains fewer than 2 elements, the function does not handle this case and will return positive infinity as `min_diff`, which is not meaningful in the context of finding a difference. Therefore, it assumes that the input list will always have at least two elements.
