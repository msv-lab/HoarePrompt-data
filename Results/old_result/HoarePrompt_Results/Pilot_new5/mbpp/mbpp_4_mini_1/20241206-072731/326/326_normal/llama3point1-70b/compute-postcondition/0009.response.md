The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. The value of `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, which means `min_diff` will now hold the absolute difference between the second and third elements of the sorted list `arr`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])**
