To analyze the given code, we need to determine whether it correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The program first sorts the input array. This is a necessary step because the minimum difference between any two elements will be between adjacent elements in the sorted array.

2. **Finding Minimum Difference**: It then initializes `min_diff` to infinity and iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements. If this difference is smaller than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff`.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the minimum difference found.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- **Empty Array**: If the input array is empty, the program will not enter the loop and will return `inf`, which does not make sense in the context of finding a minimum difference.
- **Single Element Array**: If the input has only one element, there are no pairs to compare, and the program will again return `inf`.
- **All Elements Are the Same**: If all elements are the same, logically the minimum difference should be `0`, but the program will still return `0` correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the cases where the input array is empty or has only one element, which should ideally return a meaningful result (e.g., raising an exception or returning `None`).

Therefore, based on the analysis, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails for edge cases such as an empty array or an array with a single element, which leads to an incorrect or nonsensical output.
