The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. The values for `arr` and `i` are important here. Since `i` is currently 0, this means `diff` will be calculated as `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The state of `arr` remains unchanged, `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `min_diff` and `i` retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]**
