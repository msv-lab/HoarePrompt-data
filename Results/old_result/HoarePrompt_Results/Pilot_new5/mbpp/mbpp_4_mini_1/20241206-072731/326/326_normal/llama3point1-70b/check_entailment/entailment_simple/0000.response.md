Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which asks for the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The program specifically calculates the minimum absolute difference only between consecutive elements in a sorted version of the array. 

Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Limited Comparison:** The program only compares each element with its immediate neighbor (i.e., `arr[i]` with `arr[i + 1]`), thereby potentially missing smaller differences that might exist between non-consecutive elements. For example, in the array `[1, 5, 3]`, the minimum difference is `2` (between `3` and `5`), but the program would return `2` by checking the sorted array `[1, 3, 5]` only between `3` and `5`, and it may not handle all cases correctly.

2. **Assumption of Sorted Array:** While the program sorts the array, the logic should encompass all pairwise comparisons, not just those that are consecutive. The problem description does not specify that differences should only be calculated between adjacent elements.

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, which leads to the conclusion that it does not meet the problem description's criteria. Thus, it is incorrect.
