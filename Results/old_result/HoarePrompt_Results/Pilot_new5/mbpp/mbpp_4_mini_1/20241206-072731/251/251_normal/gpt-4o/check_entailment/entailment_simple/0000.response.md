Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) into polar coordinates (r, θ). It does this by calculating:

1. **r**: The radial distance from the origin to the point (x, y), which is computed using the Pythagorean theorem: \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
2. **θ**: The angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (x, y), which is computed using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function. This function returns the angle in the correct quadrant based on the signs of x and y.

The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function is tested for specific cases with known outputs, confirming that it operates correctly for those inputs.

Overall, the function meets the problem description requirements by accurately performing the conversion from rectangular to polar coordinates for any valid input (real numbers for x and y).
