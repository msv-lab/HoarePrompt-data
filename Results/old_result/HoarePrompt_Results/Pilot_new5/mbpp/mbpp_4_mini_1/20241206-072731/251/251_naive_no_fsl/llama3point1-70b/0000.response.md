Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). 

1. **Calculation of r**: The program uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius (r), which correctly computes the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y). This is accurate for all values of x and y.

2. **Calculation of φ**: The program uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle (φ) in radians, which correctly handles all quadrants and edge cases, including when x is zero (vertical line) and when both x and y are zero (origin). This is crucial as directly using `math.atan(y/x)` would not handle these cases properly.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple (r, φ) which is the correct format for representing polar coordinates.

Since the program handles all edge cases and accurately performs the conversions as required by the problem description, it is correct.
