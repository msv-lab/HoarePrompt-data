The value of `r` is assigned the value of `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`. The values of `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, and their values are not specified. Therefore, `r` will be the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`, which is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is equal to `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2`.**
