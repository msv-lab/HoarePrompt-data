The variable `last_index` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(ch)`, which returns the highest index in the string `s` where the substring `ch` is found. If `ch` is not found, it returns -1. The previous states of `s`, `ch`, and `first_index` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.**
