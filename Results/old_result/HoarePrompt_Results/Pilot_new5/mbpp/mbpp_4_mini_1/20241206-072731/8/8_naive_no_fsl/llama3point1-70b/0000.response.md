To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description: to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Finding Occurrences:** 
   - The code uses `s.find(char)` to locate the first occurrence of `char` and `s.rfind(char)` to locate the last occurrence.
   
2. **Handling Occurrences:**
   - If both occurrences are found (`first_occurrence != -1` and `last_occurrence != -1`):
     - If the first and last occurrence are the same, it uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove that single occurrence (which is correct).
     - If they are different, it constructs a new string that concatenates:
       - The part of the string before the first occurrence.
       - The part of the string between the first and last occurrences (excluding both).
       - The part of the string after the last occurrence.
   - If the character is not found in the string, it simply returns the original string.

### Potential Cases to Consider

1. **Single Character String:**
   - Input: `("a", "a")`
   - Expected: `""` (since we remove the only occurrence)
   - Actual: The program would return `""`, which is correct.

2. **String with No Occurrences:**
   - Input: `("hello", "x")`
   - Expected: `"hello"` (no removal)
   - Actual: The program returns `"hello"`, which is correct.

3. **String with Multiple Same Characters:**
   - Input: `("hello world", "l")`
   - Expected: `"heo word"` (remove first 'l' and last 'l')
   - Actual: The program constructs the string correctly and returns `"heo word"`, which is correct.

4. **Edge Case - First and Last Character are the Same:**
   - Input: `("abcda", "a")`
   - Expected: `"bcd"` (remove first 'a' and last 'a')
   - Actual: The program correctly removes both occurrences and returns `"bcd"`.

5. **No Characters to Remove:**
   - Input: `("abc", "d")`
   - Expected: `"abc"`
   - Actual: Correctly returns `"abc"`.

6. **String with Only Two Characters:**
   - Input: `("aa", "a")`
   - Expected: `""` (removal of both 'a's)
   - Actual: The program correctly returns `""`.

7. **String with First and Last Occurrence being the Same:**
   - Input: `("banana", "b")`
   - Expected: `"anana"` (removal of both 'b's)
   - Actual: The program returns `"anana"`, which is correct.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the provided code and considering various test cases, I find that the program correctly follows the problem description for all scenarios. There are no cases where the program fails to perform as required.

Therefore, the final determination is:

Correctness: **True**
