The variable `first_index` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. The value of `first_index` will be the index of `ch` if it is found in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.**
