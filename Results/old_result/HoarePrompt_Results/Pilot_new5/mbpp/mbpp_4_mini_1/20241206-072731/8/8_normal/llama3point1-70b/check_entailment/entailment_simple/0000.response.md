To determine the correctness of the annotated program according to the provided problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The function must remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - `first_occurrence = s.find(char)` locates the index of the first occurrence of `char`.
   - `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)` locates the index of the last occurrence of `char`.

2. **Check Existence**:
   - The program checks if `char` exists at all by ensuring both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not -1.

3. **Single Occurrence Case**:
   - If `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, it indicates that `char` appears only once in the string. The program then uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove that single occurrence.

4. **Multiple Occurrences Case**:
   - If there are multiple occurrences (`first_occurrence != last_occurrence`), the program constructs a new string by concatenating:
     - The part of the string before the first occurrence `s[:first_occurrence]`.
     - The part of the string between the first and last occurrences `s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]`.
     - The part of the string after the last occurrence `s[last_occurrence + 1:]`.
   - This effectively removes the first and last occurrences of `char`.

5. **No Occurrences**:
   - If `char` is not found in `s`, the function simply returns `s` unchanged.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The function correctly implements the requirements:
- It accurately identifies and removes both the first and last occurrences of `char`.
- It handles cases where `char` appears once, multiple times, or not at all correctly.

### Conclusion:
The function meets the problem description requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the output is:

Correctness: **True**
