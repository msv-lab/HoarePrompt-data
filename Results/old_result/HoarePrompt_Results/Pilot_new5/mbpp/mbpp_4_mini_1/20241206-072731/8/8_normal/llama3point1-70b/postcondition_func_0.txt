The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`. It removes one occurrence of `char` if it appears exactly once in `s`, removes both the first and last occurrences of `char` if it appears more than once, and returns the original string `s` if `char` is not found. This function does not handle cases where the string may contain more than two occurrences of `char` and, therefore, does not account for any additional removals beyond the specified conditions.
