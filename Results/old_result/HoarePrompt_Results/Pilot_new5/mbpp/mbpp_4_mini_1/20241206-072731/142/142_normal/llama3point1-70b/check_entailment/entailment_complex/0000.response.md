Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here’s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list `lst` and an `element`. This aligns with the requirement to check if all items in the list are equal to a specific element.

2. **Core Logic**: The line `return all(item == element for item in lst)` uses a generator expression to iterate through each item in the list `lst` and checks if it is equal to `element`. The `all()` function returns `True` if all comparisons are true, which is exactly what is needed to determine if all items in the list are equal to the given element.

3. **Handling Empty Lists**: The comment within the function states that it returns `True` even if the list is empty. This is correct since the logical condition holds vacuously—there are no elements in the list to contradict the equality condition. This behavior is in accordance with expectations from the problem description.

4. **Data Type Flexibility**: The program is capable of handling any data type for both the list items and the element, as stated in the comments. This means it can correctly compare integers, strings, floats, or any other comparable types.

Overall, the function accurately implements the specified behavior, making it correct per the problem description.
