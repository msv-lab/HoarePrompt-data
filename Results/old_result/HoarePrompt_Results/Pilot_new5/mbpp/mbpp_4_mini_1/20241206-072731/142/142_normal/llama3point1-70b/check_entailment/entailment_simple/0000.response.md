Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `lst` and an `element`. The function uses the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression to check if all items in the list are equal to the provided `element`.

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two parameters: a list (`lst`) and an element (`element`) of any type. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The generator expression `item == element for item in lst` iterates through each item in the list and checks if it is equal to the `element`. This comparison is done for every item, which satisfies the requirement to check if all items are equal to the given element.

3. **Return Value**: The `all()` function returns `True` if all comparisons are `True`, and `False` otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to return `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` if they are not.

4. **Edge Cases**: The implementation also handles edge cases, such as an empty list. If the list is empty, `all()` will return `True` since there are no items that contradict the condition (this is consistent with the mathematical definition of vacuous truth).

Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and functions correctly for every potential case.
