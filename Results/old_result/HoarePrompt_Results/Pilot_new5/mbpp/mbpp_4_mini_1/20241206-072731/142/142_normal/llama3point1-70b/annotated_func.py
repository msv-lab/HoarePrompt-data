#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element can be of any type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all items in the list 'lst' are equal to 'element', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, returning `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`; otherwise, it returns `False`. It handles any data type for both the list items and the element, and it returns `True` even if `lst` is empty, as the condition holds vacuously.
