Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to check if all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. It utilizes the `all()` function, which evaluates to `True` if all elements in the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are `True`. 

Here's how it works in various scenarios:

1. **Empty List**: For an empty list `[]`, `all()` returns `True` since there are no elements that contradict the condition.

2. **List with All Equal Elements**: For example, if the input is `['a', 'a', 'a']` and the element is `'a'`, the function will return `True`.

3. **List with Mixed Elements**: If the input is `['a', 'b', 'a']` and the element is `'a'`, the function will return `False`, which is the expected behavior since not all elements are equal to `'a'`.

4. **List with Different Types**: If the input is `[1, 1, 1]` and the element is `1`, it returns `True`. If the input is `[1, 2, 1]` and the element is `1`, it returns `False`. 

In all these cases and potential edge cases, the implementation behaves as expected according to the problem description. Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
