Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, returning `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`; otherwise, it returns `False`. It handles any data type for both the list items and the element, and it returns `True` even if `lst` is empty, as the condition holds vacuously. **
