The code assigns a new value to `triangular_number`, which is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 2, we can compute `triangular_number` as follows:

1. Substitute `k` with 2 in the formula: 
   `triangular_number = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2`
2. Calculate the value step by step:
   - `2 + 1` equals `3`
   - `2 * 3` equals `6`
   - `6 // 2` equals `3`

Thus, the new value of `triangular_number` is `3`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` not being equal to `n` may still be valid depending on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3; the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
