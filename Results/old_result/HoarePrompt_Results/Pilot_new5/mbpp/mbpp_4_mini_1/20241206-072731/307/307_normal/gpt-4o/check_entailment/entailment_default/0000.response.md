To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, I will analyze both the code and hints to see if the function behaves as expected for all potential cases.

**Problem Description:** The task is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1
```

**Output Hints:** The function finds the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to `n`. It continues to compute triangular numbers indefinitely until a match is found and does not have a termination condition for `n` being too large.

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The program initializes `k` at 1 and calculates the triangular number for each `k`.
2. It checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number to see if it matches `n`. If it finds a match, it returns the value of `k`.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is a very large number, the function will run indefinitely since there is no termination condition for `n` being too large. For example, if `n = 100`, it may take a long time to find a suitable `k` and may potentially never find one, leading to performance issues.
- The function will not handle the case where `n` is less than 1, which is not a positive integer as the problem description states it should be.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
The output hints state that the function will continue indefinitely, which aligns with the observation that there is no termination condition related to the size of `n`. This supports the idea that the function may not work correctly for large values of `n`.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than 1, nor does it terminate correctly for large values of `n`. Thus, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function may run indefinitely for large values of `n`, and it does not account for cases where `n` is less than 1.
