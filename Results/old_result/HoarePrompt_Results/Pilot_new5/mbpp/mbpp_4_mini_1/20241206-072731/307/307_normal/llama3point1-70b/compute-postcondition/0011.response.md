The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was 2, so after the execution, `idx` becomes 3. The values of `n` and `triangular_num` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 3 with its string representation having a length less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 3 with its string representation having a length less than `n`.**
