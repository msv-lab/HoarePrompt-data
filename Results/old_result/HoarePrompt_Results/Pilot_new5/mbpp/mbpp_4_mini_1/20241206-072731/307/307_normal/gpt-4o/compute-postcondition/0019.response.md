Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to `n`. The function will continue to compute triangular numbers and increment `k` indefinitely until it finds a match, which means it does not have a termination condition for n being too large. **
