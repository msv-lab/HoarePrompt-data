Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement of finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Understanding Triangular Numbers**: The program calculates triangular numbers using the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), which is correct for generating the sequence of triangular numbers.

2. **Determining the Number of Digits**: The program converts the triangular number to a string and checks its length to determine the number of digits. This is the correct way to count the digits of a number.

3. **Loop Until Condition Met**: The `while True` loop continues until it finds a triangular number that has exactly `n` digits. The `if` condition inside the loop checks for this.

4. **Return the Correct Index**: When the condition is met (i.e., when the triangular number has `n` digits), the function returns `k`, which is the index of that triangular number.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) suggest that the function has been tested against known outputs. These assertions imply that when `n` is 2, 3, and 4, the function correctly identifies the indices of the smallest triangular numbers with that many digits.

Since the program meets all the requirements and correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description, it is deemed correct.
