The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer parameter `n`, which represents the number of digits in a triangular number. The function calculates triangular numbers iteratively and checks their digit length. It continues to increment an index `idx` until it finds the smallest `idx` such that the corresponding triangular number has at least `n` digits. The function returns this index value.

It's important to note that the function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative; such cases could lead to an infinite loop since it is only designed for positive integers. The descriptions given in the annotations regarding the return values and the nature of the results are accurate in that it will return the smallest index for which the triangular number has at least `n` digits, but they could imply that only certain specific values (like 1, 2, or 3) are returned, which is misleading as `idx` could be any positive integer.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the triangular number corresponding to `idx` has at least `n` digits. It does not handle the case where `n` is non-positive, which could lead to an infinite loop. **
