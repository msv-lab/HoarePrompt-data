The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. After executing the function body, if specific conditions are met, the function can return different values for `k` based on the following cases: 

- Case 1: The function returns `k` which is equal to 1.
- Case 2: The function returns `k` which is equal to 2.
- Case 3: The function returns the value of `k`, which is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return different integer values (1, 2, or 3) based on certain internal conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns different values for k based on specific conditions: 1, 2, or 3.**
