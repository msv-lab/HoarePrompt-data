According to the code, since this is a `while True` loop, it will always execute one more time regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to proceed. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
