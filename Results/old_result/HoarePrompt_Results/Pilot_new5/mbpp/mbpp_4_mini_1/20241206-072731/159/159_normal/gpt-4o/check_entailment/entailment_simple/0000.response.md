Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality requested in the problem description, which is to find the volume of a cone. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Mathematical Formula**: The program uses the correct formula for calculating the volume of a cone: 
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(radius, height)` takes two parameters: `radius` and `height`, both of which are specified in the program as non-negative floats or integers. This aligns with the typical definition of volume, where both radius and height must be non-negative.

3. **Assertions**: The program includes assertions that test the function with specific values:
   - `func_1(5, 12)` calculates the volume of a cone with a radius of 5 and height of 12, resulting in approximately 314.15926535897927.
   - `func_1(10, 15)` calculates the volume with a radius of 10 and height of 15, resulting in approximately 1570.7963267948965.
   - `func_1(19, 17)` calculates the volume with a radius of 19 and height of 17, resulting in approximately 6426.651371693521.
   
   All these assertions check if the outputs are within a small relative tolerance of the expected values, confirming that the function works as intended for those test cases.

Thus, since the function accurately calculates the volume of a cone based on the provided radius and height, the program adheres to the problem description's requirements.
