The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples and return a new tuple that consists of the bitwise AND results of their corresponding elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, tup1 and tup2, both of which are tuples, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2.**
