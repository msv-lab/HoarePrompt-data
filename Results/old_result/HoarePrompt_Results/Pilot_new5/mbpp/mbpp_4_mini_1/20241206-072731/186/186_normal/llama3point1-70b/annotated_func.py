#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuples 'tup1' and 'tup2'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from both tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, it will only compute the AND for the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, effectively ignoring any excess elements in the longer tuple.
