To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze both the problem description and the program itself.

**Problem Description:** The function should extract element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples, which means it should compute the bitwise AND for corresponding elements from both tuples.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

The provided code uses the `zip()` function to pair up elements from both tuples and then applies the bitwise AND operator `&` to each pair. The result is returned as a new tuple.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Functionality**: The function correctly computes the bitwise AND for the elements of the tuples provided they are of equal length. If they are of unequal length, the `zip()` function will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple, effectively ignoring any excess elements in the longer tuple.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If both tuples are empty, the output will be an empty tuple `()`, which is correct as there are no elements to process.
   - If one tuple is empty and the other is not, the result will also be an empty tuple, which is correct.
   - If both tuples have elements but are of different lengths, only the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple are processed, which aligns with the expectation in the problem description.

3. **Examples from the Problem**:
   - `(10, 4, 6, 9) & (5, 2, 3, 3)` computes to `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, correctly matching the expected output.
   - `(1, 2, 3, 4) & (5, 6, 7, 8)` computes to `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which is also correct.
   - `(8, 9, 11, 12) & (7, 13, 14, 17)` computes to `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, confirming the function's correctness on these examples.

### Output Hints:
The output hints explain that the function only computes the bitwise AND for the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, which is consistent with how `zip()` works in Python.

### Conclusion:
The function does what the problem describes correctly and handles edge cases appropriately. The output hints corroborate the functionality of the code.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly computes the bitwise AND for all valid cases described in the problem statement.
