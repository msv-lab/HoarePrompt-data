To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze both the problem description and the provided implementation.

Problem description: The function should extract element-wise results from two tuples.

The function `func_1` is defined to return a tuple of element-wise bitwise AND results from two input tuples. The bitwise AND operation is denoted by the `&` operator in Python.

Let's analyze the assertions provided in the program:

1. For the first assertion:
   ```python
   func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) 
   ```
   - Calculation:
     - 10 & 5 = 0
     - 4 & 2 = 0
     - 6 & 3 = 2
     - 9 & 3 = 1
   - Result: (0, 0, 2, 1) — This is correct.

2. For the second assertion:
   ```python
   func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))
   ```
   - Calculation:
     - 1 & 5 = 1
     - 2 & 6 = 2
     - 3 & 7 = 3
     - 4 & 8 = 0
   - Result: (1, 2, 3, 0) — This is correct.

3. For the third assertion:
   ```python
   func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))
   ```
   - Calculation:
     - 8 & 7 = 0
     - 9 & 13 = 9
     - 11 & 14 = 10
     - 12 & 17 = 0
   - Result: (0, 9, 10, 0) — This result is incorrect. The expected result was stated as (0, 9, 10, 0), which is correct, but the calculation shows that it should be (0, 9, 10, 0), which is the same, hence the assertion is true.

The function seems to work correctly for the provided test cases. However, we must also consider edge cases. For example:

- If either of the tuples is empty, e.g., `func_1((), ())`, the function will return an empty tuple, which is correct as well.
- If one tuple is empty and the other is not, e.g., `func_1((), (1, 2))`, the function will also return an empty tuple, which is consistent with tuple behavior in Python.

Given the above reasoning, I cannot find a case where the code does not work as expected based on the provided assertions or potential edge cases.

Correctness: **True**

The function correctly implements element-wise bitwise AND for the two tuples, and it handles edge cases appropriately.
