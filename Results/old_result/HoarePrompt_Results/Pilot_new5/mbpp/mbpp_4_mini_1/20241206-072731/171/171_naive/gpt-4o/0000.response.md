Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulus operator `%` to check if the remainder when `n` is divided by `2` is not equal to `0`, which is the correct approach for identifying odd numbers. 

The provided assertions further confirm the correctness of the implementation:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, correctly identifying that 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True`, correctly identifying that 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False`, correctly identifying that 10 is even.

Since all tested cases align with the problem description and there are no identified edge cases where the function fails, the program is correct.
