Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` is designed to determine whether the parity of the given integer `n` is odd. It achieves this by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`, which evaluates to `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., when the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to zero) and `False` if `n` is even (i.e., when the remainder is zero).

The assertions provided confirm the correctness of the function:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True`, which is correct because 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False`, which is correct because 10 is even.

Since the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases and accurately determines the parity of any integer input as specified in the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.
