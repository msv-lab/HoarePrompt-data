The given program is intended to check whether every odd index in a list contains odd numbers. Let's evaluate the program against the problem description.

- The function `func_1(lst)` iterates through each index `i` of the list `lst`.
- It checks if the index `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`) and if the value at that index (`lst[i]`) is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
- If it finds an even number at any odd index, it returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any even number at odd indices, it returns `True`.

Given this logic, we can analyze a few cases:

1. If the list is empty, the function will return `True` since there are no indices to check.
2. If all odd indices contain odd numbers (e.g., for the list `[1, 3, 5, 7]`), the function will return `True`.
3. If there is an even number at any odd index (e.g., for the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, where index 1 has an even number), the function will return `False`.
4. If there are only even numbers at odd indices, it correctly identifies this and returns `False`.

However, the function explicitly checks for even numbers at odd indices and does not consider odd numbers at even indices. The problem description states that every odd index should contain odd numbers, and while the function checks for even numbers at odd indices, it doesn't account for cases where odd numbers are present at even indices. This means that the function effectively addresses the problem but does not validate that odd indices contain odd numbers in all potential cases accurately.

For example, if we have a list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, index 1 (which is odd) contains an even number (2), and thus the function correctly returns `False`. However, for a list like `[2, 1, 4, 3]`, index 1 contains 1 (odd), and index 3 contains 3 (odd), which means it would incorrectly pass despite not validating the odd index condition.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirement that every odd index must contain odd numbers correctly in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
