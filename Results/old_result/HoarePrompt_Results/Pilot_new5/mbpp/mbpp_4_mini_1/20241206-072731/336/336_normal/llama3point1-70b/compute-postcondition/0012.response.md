The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function evaluates the integers in the list based on their index positions. 

- In Case_1, if the current index is even (specifically 0) and the integer at `lst[0]` is also even, the function returns `False`.
- In Case_2, the function returns `False`.
- In Case_3, the function returns `False`.
- In Case_4, if no odd index in the list `lst` has an even value, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `False` if certain conditions regarding the evenness of indexed values are met, or return `True` if no odd index has an even value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `False` if the first element is even, or for other conditions, and returns `True` if no odd index in `lst` has an even value.**
