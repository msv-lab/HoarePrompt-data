#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, if the loop executes all times then no odd index in `lst` has an even value.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that no odd index in the list 'lst' has an even value
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks if there are any even values at odd indices. If it finds an even number at any odd index, it returns `False`. If all odd indices contain odd numbers (or if the list is empty), it returns `True`. The function does not check the value at index 0, so it does not directly return `False` for that case.
