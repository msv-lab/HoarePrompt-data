To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we should analyze both the function and the requirements it aims to meet.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis

The program is designed to iterate over the given list and check:
- If the index `i` of the current element is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
- If the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

If both conditions are true, it returns `False`, indicating that not every odd index contains an odd number. If the loop completes without finding such a case, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty List:** An empty list should return `True` because there are no indices to check.
2. **List with Even Length:** A list like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` should return `True` because odd indices (1 and 3) contain even numbers.
3. **List with Odd Length:** A list like `[1, 2, 3]` should return `False` because the element at index 1 is even.
4. **List with All Odd Numbers:** A list such as `[1, 3, 5, 7]` should return `True` since all numbers at odd indices are odd.
5. **List with All Even Numbers:** A list such as `[2, 4, 6, 8]` should return `False` since all numbers at odd indices are even.

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails
Consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- The index `1` contains the value `2`, which is even. 
- According to the program's logic, it would return `False`, which is correct.

However, consider the input list `[1, 1, 1]`:
- Index 1 contains `1` (which is odd), and index 2 contains `1` (which is even).
- The output should be `True` since index `1` contains an odd number, but the program is checking the wrong indices.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the check for odd indices properly, and it can give wrong results for certain inputs, particularly when the logic does not account for the correct evaluation of all odd indices.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
