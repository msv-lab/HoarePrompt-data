The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elements`. The parameter `tup` is a tuple, and the parameter `elements` is a list that may contain elements that are present in `tup`. After executing the function body, the program returns the total occurrences of the elements from the list `elements` found in the tuple `tup`, represented by a non-negative integer `count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list of elements `elements`, and return the total count of occurrences of those elements in the tuple. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list of elements `elements`, and returns the total occurrences of the elements from `elements` in `tup`, represented as a non-negative integer `count`.**
