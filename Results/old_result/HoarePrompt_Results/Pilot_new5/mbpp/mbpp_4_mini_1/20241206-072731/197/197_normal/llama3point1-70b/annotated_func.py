#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the total count of elements in the tuple 'tup' that match any of the elements in the list 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `lst` within the tuple `tup`. It does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or `tup` contains no matching elements, which would naturally yield a count of zero. Therefore, if `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, as there are no elements to count.
