The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `lst` within the tuple `tup`. It does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or `tup` contains no matching elements, which would naturally yield a count of zero. Therefore, if `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, as there are no elements to count.
