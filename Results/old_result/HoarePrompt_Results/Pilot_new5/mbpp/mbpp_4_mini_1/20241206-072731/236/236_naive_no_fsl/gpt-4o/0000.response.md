Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether the specified list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list, comparing it to the next element.
- If it finds any instance where an element is greater than the next element (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. 
- If it goes through the entire list without finding any such instance, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

The provided assertions in the program correctly validate the behavior:
1. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True`, which confirms the list is sorted.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False`, which confirms the list is not sorted due to the last two elements (20 and 17).
3. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False`, which confirms the list is not sorted due to the elements 15 and 14.

No edge cases or potential issues were found that would cause the function to fail in its intended purpose, confirming the correctness of the implementation.
