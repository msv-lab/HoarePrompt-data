You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'nums' is equal to its sorted version, meaning it checks if 'nums' is in non-decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of comparable elements `nums` and returns `True` if `nums` is in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. It does not account for edge cases such as empty lists, which are inherently in non-decreasing order, and the behavior remains the same for lists with one element. Therefore, the function correctly identifies ordered lists and returns appropriate boolean values for various cases, including empty and single-element lists.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
