To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the implementation of the function `func_1` based on the problem description, which is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number.

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits 'n' is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

Let's evaluate the code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n
```

1. The function converts the integer `n` to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It calculates the number of digits (`num_len`).
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Finally, it checks if this computed sum is equal to the original number `n`.

The test cases provided:
- `func_1(153) == True` (Correct, 153 is an Armstrong number)
- `func_1(259) == False` (Correct, 259 is not an Armstrong number)
- `func_1(4458) == False` (Correct, 4458 is not an Armstrong number)

Now, let's consider edge cases and other numbers:
- For `n = 0`, the expected result is `True` because \(0^1 = 0\).
- For `n = 1`, the expected result is `True` because \(1^1 = 1\).
- For `n = 10`, the expected result is `False` because \(1^2 + 0^2 = 1 \neq 10\).

The function correctly identifies these cases:
- `func_1(0) == True` (The function should return True)
- `func_1(1) == True` (The function should return True)
- `func_1(10) == False` (The function should return False)

After evaluating the function with various cases, including potential edge cases, it correctly identifies Armstrong numbers and does not miss any cases.

Therefore, we conclude that the code meets the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
