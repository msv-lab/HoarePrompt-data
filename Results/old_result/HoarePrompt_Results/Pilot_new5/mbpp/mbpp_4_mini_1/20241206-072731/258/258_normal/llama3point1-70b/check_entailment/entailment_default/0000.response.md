To evaluate the given Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break down the task.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to write a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

**Output Hints:**
The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and checks if it is an Armstrong number. It calculates the sum of each digit in `num`, raised to the power of the number of digits in `num`. The function returns `True` if this sum equals `num`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Initial Assessment

1. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The program converts the given number into a string to iterate over each digit.
   - It calculates the number of digits (`num_len`).
   - It then sums each digit raised to the power of `num_len`.
   - Finally, it checks if this sum equals the original number.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - A potential edge case is when `num` is 0, which is an Armstrong number because \(0^1 = 0\).
   - The smallest non-negative number, 1, is also an Armstrong number because \(1^1 = 1\).
   - The program should also correctly handle multi-digit Armstrong numbers, such as 153 (since \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\)).

### Review of Output Hints
The output hints correctly describe the functionâ€™s purpose and the way it checks for Armstrong numbers. There are no inconsistencies between the output hints and the program, and they align well with the logic used in the code.

### Conclusion
The code appears to correctly implement the logic to check for Armstrong numbers for all potential cases, including the edge cases mentioned (0 and 1). Given that there are no identified discrepancies between the program, the problem description, and the output hints, the function operates as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
