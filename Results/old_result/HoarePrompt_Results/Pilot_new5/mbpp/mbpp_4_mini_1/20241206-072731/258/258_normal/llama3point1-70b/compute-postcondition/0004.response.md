The variable `sum` is updated by adding `int(digit) ** num_len` to its current value. Given that `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is its string representation, and `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, we can infer that `digit`, being the first character of `num_str`, is a digit (0-9) corresponding to the most significant digit of `num`. The value of `int(digit)` will be a non-negative integer, and `num_len` will be at least 1 since `num` is non-negative.

The value of `sum` initially is 0, so after the operation `sum += int(digit) ** num_len`, we can conclude that the new value of `sum` will be `int(digit) ** num_len`.

Therefore, the output state is: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, and `sum` is equal to `int(digit) ** num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is equal to `int(digit) ** num_len**.**
