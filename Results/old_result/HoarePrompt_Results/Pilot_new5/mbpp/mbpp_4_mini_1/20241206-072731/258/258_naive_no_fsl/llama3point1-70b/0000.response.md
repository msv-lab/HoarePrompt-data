Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the algorithm to check if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number for a given number of digits 'n' is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of 'n'. 

The function `func_1(num)` works as follows:
1. It converts the input number `num` to a string to easily access each digit.
2. It calculates the number of digits using `len(num_str)`.
3. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will hold the cumulative sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. It iterates through each digit in the string representation of the number, raising it to the power of `num_len` and adding it to `sum`.
5. Finally, it checks if the calculated sum equals the original number and returns the result.

This logic correctly handles all scenarios for Armstrong numbers, including 0, single-digit numbers, and multi-digit numbers. For example:
- For `num = 153`, it calculates \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\), which is valid.
- For `num = 9474`, it calculates \(9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 9474\), which is also valid.

Since the function handles all edge cases correctly and adheres to the problem description without missing any details, I conclude that the implementation is correct.

Thus, the result is True.
