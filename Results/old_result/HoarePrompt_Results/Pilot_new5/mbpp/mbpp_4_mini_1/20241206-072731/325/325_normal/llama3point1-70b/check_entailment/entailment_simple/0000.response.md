Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. While the program correctly identifies the months that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November), it fails to handle the cases for the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and February, which has 28 or 29 days. 

Specifically, the program returns `False` for months with 31 days and does not account for February at all. Hence, it does not provide correct output for all valid inputs (1 through 12). 

For example:
- `func_1(1)` (January) returns `False`, which is incorrect since January has 31 days.
- `func_1(2)` (February) also returns `False`, which is also incorrect as February does not have 30 days.

Since the function fails to accurately determine whether the month contains 30 days for all valid inputs, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements.
