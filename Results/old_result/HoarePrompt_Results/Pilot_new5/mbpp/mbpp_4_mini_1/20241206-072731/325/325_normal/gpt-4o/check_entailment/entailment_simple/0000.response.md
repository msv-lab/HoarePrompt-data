Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that we need to check whether a given month number contains 30 days, but the function `func_1` currently only returns `True` for the months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November) and returns `False` for all other months, which includes months with 31 days and February.

Here are the specific issues:

1. The function does not account for the fact that February (month 2) has 28 days in a non-leap year and does not belong to the group of months with 30 days. However, it also fails to return `False` for months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) when it should return `False`.
   
2. The assertions provided suggest that `func_1(12)` should return `False`, which is correct, but months like January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12) should also return `False`, which the function does not explicitly check for.

In summary, the function does not implement the complete logic for determining whether a month has 30 days, as it only checks for specific months while failing to provide appropriate results for the remaining months. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
