Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly identify the number of days in all relevant months. Specifically, it does not account for the months that have 31 days or the fact that February has only 28 days in a non-leap year, and 29 days in a leap year. 

For example, calling `func_1(1)` (January) or `func_1(3)` (March) would both return `False`, although these months contain 31 days and should not be classified as months with 30 days. Additionally, calling `func_1(2)` should return `False`, which is correctly identified in the assertions, but the overall logic does not encompass all months correctly. 

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
