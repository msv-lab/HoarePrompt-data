The function accepts an integer `month` (expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive) and returns `True` if `month` corresponds to April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11), which are the months with thirty days. For all other months, including those with thirty-one or twenty-eight days, it returns `False`. The function does not handle invalid inputs (months outside the range of 1 to 12).
