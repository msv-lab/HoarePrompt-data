The code assigns the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp` is a list filled with 1's and considering `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, we have:

- `dp[i]` initially is `dp[1]`, which is 1 (since `dp` is filled with 1's).
- `dp[j] + 1` is `dp[0] + 1`, which equals `1 + 1 = 2`.

Now, we find the maximum of the two values:
- `max(1, 2) = 2`.

Thus, `dp[1]` is updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.**
