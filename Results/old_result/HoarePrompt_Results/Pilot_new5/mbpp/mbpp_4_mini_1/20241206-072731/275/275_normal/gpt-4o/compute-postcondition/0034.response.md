According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The `range(i)` creates a sequence from 0 to `i-1`, so the loop can continue executing as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be at least 1 since `nums` has at least one element and `j` iterates from 0 to `i-1`. 

Therefore, if `i` is currently its last value before the next iteration, the next value of `j` will be `j = i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, thus the loop will not execute again unless `i` is increased. Therefore, we need `i` to be at least 2 for the loop to execute again, allowing `j` to be incremented to 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` must be at least 2**
