The variable `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `dp[i]` represents the value at the index equal to the length of the list `nums`. The current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`, which means that the condition for the update is satisfied. The previous value of `dp[i]` is compared with `dp[j] + 1`, and the greater value is assigned back to `dp[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of 1's with `dp[i]` updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of 1's with `dp[i]` updated to be `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 0.**
