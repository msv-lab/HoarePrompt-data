The statement `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` based on its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. 

In this context, `dp[i]` is being assigned the maximum of its current value `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, which signifies that we are considering whether to extend the longest divisible subset ending at index `j` to include the element at index `i`. 

The current state of `dp` will be altered, but the specific values of `dp[i]`, `dp[j]`, and `j` are unknown, except that `i` is at least 2, and `j` is likely constrained by the algorithm (e.g., `j < i`).

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is at least 2, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value or `dp[j] + 1`.**
