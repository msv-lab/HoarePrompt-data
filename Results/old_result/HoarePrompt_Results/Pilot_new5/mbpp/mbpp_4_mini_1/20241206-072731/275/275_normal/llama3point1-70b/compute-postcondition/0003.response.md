The code `nums.sort()` sorts the list of integers `nums` in ascending order. Since `nums` is not empty, its order will be changed based on the values it currently holds. The specific values in `nums` are not provided, but we know it will now be in sorted order. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.**
