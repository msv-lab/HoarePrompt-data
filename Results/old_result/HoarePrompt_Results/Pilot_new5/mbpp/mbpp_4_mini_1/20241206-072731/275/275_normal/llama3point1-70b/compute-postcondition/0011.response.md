The value of `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. 

Initially, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0. The list `dp` has a length equal to `nums`, and all elements are initialized to 1. Therefore, `dp[i]` (which is `dp[2]`) is currently 1, and `dp[j]` (which is `dp[0]`) is also 1. 

Now, we calculate:
- `dp[j] + 1` is equal to `dp[0] + 1` which is `1 + 1 = 2`.

Now, we take the maximum:
- `dp[i]` becomes `max(dp[2], dp[0] + 1)` which is `max(1, 2)`, resulting in `dp[2]` being updated to 2.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list where the third element is now 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
