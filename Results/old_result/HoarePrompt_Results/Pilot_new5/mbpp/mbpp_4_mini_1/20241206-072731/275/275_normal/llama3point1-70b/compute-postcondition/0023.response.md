In the given code snippet, `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp` is initially a list filled with 1's, the value of `dp[i]` can either remain 1 or be updated based on the value of `dp[j]`.

With `i` being incremented to `i + 1`, we know that `i` can take on values greater than or equal to 2. The variable `j` can be any integer from 0 to `i - 1`. 

The operation implies that for a certain `j`, we are checking how many elements can be included up to the `i`th index, providing that the condition `nums[i] > nums[j]` is satisfied (which is implicit in the context of finding the longest increasing subsequence).

After this line of code:
- The value of `dp[i]` could potentially be greater than its previous value depending on the value of `dp[j]`, but we do not have specific values for `dp[j]` or the resulting `dp[i]` after the operation without more information about the current state of `dp` and the relationship between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.

Thus, the output state must capture the fact that `dp[i]` has been evaluated against `dp[j] + 1`, while also reflecting that `i` has been updated:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list that may have changed at index `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `j` is less than `i` and can be from 0 to `i - 1`.**
