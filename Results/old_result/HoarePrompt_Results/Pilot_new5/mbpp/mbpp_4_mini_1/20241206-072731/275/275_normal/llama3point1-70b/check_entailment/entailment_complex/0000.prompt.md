You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the list 'nums' is empty and contributes no elements.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list where each entry `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of divisible subsequences ending with `nums[i]`, calculated based on the divisibility conditions applied throughout the loop. If `nums` has `n` elements, then `dp` reflects the longest divisible subsequence for each element in `nums`, starting from `1` for all elements and updated accordingly.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of divisible subsequences from the list `nums`, as reflected in the `dp` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if the list is empty. If `nums` is not empty, it returns the maximum length of divisible subsequences within the list, calculated based on the divisibility conditions of its elements. The function ensures that each element in the subsequence is divisible by its preceding elements in the sorted list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
