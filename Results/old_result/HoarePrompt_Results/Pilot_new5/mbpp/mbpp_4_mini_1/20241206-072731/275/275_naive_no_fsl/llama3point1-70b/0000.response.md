Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible by each other. 

The steps taken by the program are as follows:
1. It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the program returns `0`, which is the correct behavior as there are no elements to form a subset.
2. The program sorts the list of numbers, which is essential for ensuring that when checking divisibility, smaller numbers appear before larger ones.
3. It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the element `nums[i]`.
4. The nested loops check every possible pair of elements in `nums` to see if one number is divisible by the other, updating the `dp` array accordingly.
5. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest subset found.

The program correctly handles various cases, including:
- An empty list.
- Lists with the same numbers (e.g., [2, 2, 2]).
- Lists with primes and composites.
- Lists where no two numbers are divisible.

I could not find any edge cases or inputs where the program does not meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, I conclude that the program works correctly for all possible inputs as outlined in the problem description.
