Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `i` is greater than 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.***
