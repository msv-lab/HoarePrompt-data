According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop iterates over the range `j` from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`. 

Since we need to execute the loop one more time, we will increment `j` by 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 2, so that `j` can take the value of `1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` must be at least 2.**
