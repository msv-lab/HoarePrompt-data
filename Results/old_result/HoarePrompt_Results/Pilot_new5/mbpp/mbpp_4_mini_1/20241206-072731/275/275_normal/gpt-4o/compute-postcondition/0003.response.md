The `nums.sort()` method sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. Since `nums` is not empty, its order will change based on the values it contains, but we don't have the specific values in this scenario. Therefore, `nums` will now be a sorted list, while the states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers**
