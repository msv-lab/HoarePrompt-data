#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the list 'nums' is empty and contributes no elements.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list where each entry `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of divisible subsequences ending with `nums[i]`, calculated based on the divisibility conditions applied throughout the loop. If `nums` has `n` elements, then `dp` reflects the longest divisible subsequence for each element in `nums`, starting from `1` for all elements and updated accordingly.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of divisible subsequences from the list `nums`, as reflected in the `dp` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if the list is empty. If `nums` is not empty, it returns the maximum length of divisible subsequences within the list, calculated based on the divisibility conditions of its elements. The function ensures that each element in the subsequence is divisible by its preceding elements in the sorted list.
