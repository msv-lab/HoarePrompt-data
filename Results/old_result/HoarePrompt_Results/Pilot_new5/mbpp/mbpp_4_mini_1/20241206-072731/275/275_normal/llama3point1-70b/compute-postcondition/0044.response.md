Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if the list is empty. If `nums` is not empty, it returns the maximum length of divisible subsequences within the list, calculated based on the divisibility conditions of its elements. The function ensures that each element in the subsequence is divisible by its preceding elements in the sorted list. **
