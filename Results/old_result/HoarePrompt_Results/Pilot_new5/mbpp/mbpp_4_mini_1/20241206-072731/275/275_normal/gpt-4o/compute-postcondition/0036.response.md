Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, and `i` is at least 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value or `dp[j] + 1`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
