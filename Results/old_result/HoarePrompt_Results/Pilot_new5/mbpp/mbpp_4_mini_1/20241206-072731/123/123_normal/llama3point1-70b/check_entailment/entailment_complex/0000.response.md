Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set out in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`. The function returns a tuple containing two parts of the list:

1. The first part consists of the first `L` elements, which is achieved using the slice `lst[:L]`.
2. The second part consists of the elements from index `L` to the end of the list, obtained using the slice `lst[L:]`.

The program includes an annotation that confirms the constraints of `L`: it must be a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. This ensures that the slicing operations will not lead to any index errors, and it covers edge cases:

- If `L` is `0`, the first part will be an empty list `[]`, and the second part will be the entire list `lst`.
- If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first part will contain all elements of the list, and the second part will be an empty list `[]`.

Therefore, the function meets the problem description's requirements comprehensively for all potential cases, ensuring it behaves as intended.
