To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and check if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The function should:
1. Take in a list and an integer \( L \).
2. Split the given list into two parts:
   - The first part should have a length of \( L \).
   - The second part should contain the remainder of the list.
3. Return these two parts as a tuple.

### Program Analysis:
The function works as follows:
```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```
- `lst[:L]` retrieves the first \( L \) elements from the list.
- `lst[L:]` retrieves the elements from the \( L \)-th index to the end of the list.
- The function returns a tuple containing these two parts.

### Test Cases:
The provided assertions test the function with:
1. A list of integers and \( L = 3 \).
2. A list of characters and \( L = 2 \).
3. Another list of characters and \( L = 4 \).

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **When \( L \) is 0**: The function should return two empty lists `([], lst)`.
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` should return `([], [1, 2, 3])`.
   
2. **When \( L \) is greater than the length of the list**: The function should still return the entire list as the second part along with an empty first part.
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2], 5)` should return `([1, 2], [])`.

3. **When \( L \) is negative**: The slicing behavior in Python will return the entire list as the second part and empty as the first.
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2, 3], -1)` should return `([], [1, 2, 3])`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Let's analyze the edge cases and their expected outcomes:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` returns `([], [1, 2, 3])` ✔️
- `func_1([1, 2], 5)` returns `([1, 2], [])` ✔️
- `func_1([1, 2, 3], -1)` returns `([], [1, 2, 3])` ✔️

All edge cases are handled correctly by the current implementation.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly handles all provided test cases and additional edge cases, we can conclude that the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
