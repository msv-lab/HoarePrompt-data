Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(d, n)` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and filters the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

The use of dictionary comprehension along with the condition `if v >= n` ensures that only the key-value pairs satisfying this condition are included in the output. 

I cannot think of any edge cases or inputs where this logic would fail, as it accurately reflects the requirement to filter based on the values in the dictionary. Therefore, the program meets the problem's requirements for all potential cases.
