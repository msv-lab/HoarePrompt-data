Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as parameters and filters the dictionary to include only those entries whose values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

Here's why it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a dictionary where the values are integers (as specified), and an integer `n`.
  
2. **Filtering Logic**: The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` effectively filters out any entries where the value is less than `n`, thereby ensuring that only key-value pairs with values greater than or equal to `n` are included in the returned dictionary.

3. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program test various scenarios:
   - The first assertion checks values greater than or equal to 170.
   - The second checks for values greater than or equal to 180.
   - The third checks for values greater than or equal to 190.
   
   Each assertion correctly represents the expected output for the given inputs, which confirms that the function behaves as intended.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although the function does not explicitly handle cases where `d` is empty or if `n` is not an integer, the behavior in these scenarios is still valid because:
   - If `d` is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary, which is consistent with the requirement.
   - If `n` is not an integer, it is assumed that the function will not be called with invalid types based on the problem description context.

Overall, the function meets the problem's requirement of filtering a dictionary based on the specified criteria. Thus, the program is correct.
