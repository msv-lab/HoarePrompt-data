Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. It then constructs a new dictionary using a dictionary comprehension that includes only those key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`.

Here's a breakdown of how the implementation meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two parameters: a dictionary (`d`) and an integer (`n`), which aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The core logic of filtering is done using a list comprehension: `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}`. This means that for each key-value pair in the dictionary, it checks if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. Only the pairs that satisfy this condition are included in the new dictionary.

3. **Output**: The function returns a new dictionary containing only the entries that met the filtering criteria. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

Additionally, the assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests to validate that the function behaves as expected for different scenarios. Each assertion checks specific cases, demonstrating that the function correctly filters the dictionary based on the integer `n`.

In summary, since the function meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description and passes the assertions provided, it is correct. Thus, the correctness of the program can be confirmed.
