The given program is designed to filter entries from a dictionary based on whether their values are greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`. 

### Initial Assessment:
The code uses a dictionary comprehension to achieve this:
```python
def func_1(d: dict, n: int) -> dict:
    return {k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}
```
This should correctly return a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value meets the condition. 

However, let's consider potential edge cases:
1. **Empty Dictionary**: The program should handle an empty dictionary (`d={}`) correctly by returning an empty dictionary. This scenario does not seem to be explicitly handled or mentioned.
2. **Non-integer `n`**: If `n` is not an integer, the code will not raise an error, but it might lead to unexpected behavior since the comparison might not be as intended.
3. **All Values Below `n`**: The code will return an empty dictionary if all values are below `n`, which is consistent with the expected behavior. 

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function does not handle cases where `d` is empty or if `n` is not an integer, but it will return an empty dictionary if no values meet the criteria. This aligns with the behavior observed in the main function.

### Conclusion:
The main issue here is the lack of handling for the edge cases mentioned above, particularly the lack of explicit handling for when `d` is empty or when `n` is not an integer. Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically with regard to empty dictionaries and non-integer values), we conclude that the correctness is:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for cases when the input dictionary is empty or when `n` is not an integer, which means it doesn't cover all potential cases as outlined in the problem description.
