Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`. It filters the dictionary to only include entries (key-value pairs) where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. This is done using a dictionary comprehension, which succinctly constructs a new dictionary based on the condition specified.

2. **Return Value**: If the dictionary `d` is empty, the function will naturally return an empty dictionary, which is the expected behavior as stated in the problem description.

3. **Value Comparison**: The function operates under the assumption that the values in the dictionary are comparable to integers, which is a necessary condition for the comparison `v >= n` to be valid. The provided program does not explicitly handle non-integer values or types other than a dictionary with comparable values. However, since the problem description does not specify handling these edge cases, the function is correct in its current form.

4. **No Unhandled Cases**: The function does not include any logic that would conflict with the problem description. It strictly adheres to filtering based on the value comparison without introducing additional complexity or unnecessary operations.

Overall, since the function implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description, it is correct.
