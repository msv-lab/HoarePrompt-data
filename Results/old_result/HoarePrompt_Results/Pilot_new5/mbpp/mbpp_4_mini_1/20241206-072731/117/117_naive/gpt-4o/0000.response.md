Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate through each element in the list and checks if it is an instance of `int`. The `sum` function then counts how many times this condition is true. 

The assertions provided as test cases confirm that the function works correctly for various inputs:
1. For the input `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`, it correctly counts `1` and `2` as integers, returning `2`.
2. For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, it counts all three elements as integers, returning `3`.
3. For the input `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]`, it counts only `1` and `4` as integers, returning `2`.

No edge cases have been identified where the function would fail to meet the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
