Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst)` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the input list `lst`. It uses a generator expression to check each element using `isinstance(x, int)` and sums up the number of elements that are integers. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Handles All Types**: The function definitively identifies integers, which includes both positive and negative integers, as well as zero.
2. **Excludes Non-integers**: It properly ignores non-integer values, such as floats, strings, lists, or any other data types.
3. **Empty List Handling**: If the input list is empty, the function returns 0, which is the expected behavior since there are no integer elements.
4. **Performance**: The code efficiently checks each element and computes the sum without needing additional loops or conditional statements.

No edge cases or potential failures have been identified that would cause the function to behave incorrectly according to the problem description. Thus, the implementation adheres to the requirements fully.
