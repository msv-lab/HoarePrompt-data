#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that may include integers and other types.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst' by summing 1 for each element 'x' in 'lst' that is identified as an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` that may contain integers and other types, and returns the count of integer elements in the list. It does not account for edge cases where `lst` could be empty or contain non-integer types, as it simply sums 1 for each integer found.
