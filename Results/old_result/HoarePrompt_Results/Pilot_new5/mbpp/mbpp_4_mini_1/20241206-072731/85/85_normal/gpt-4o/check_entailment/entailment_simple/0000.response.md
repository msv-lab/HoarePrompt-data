Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple (which can be considered as an array of integers) as input and calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in that array.

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Finding Minimum and Maximum Values**: The program correctly identifies the minimum value (`min_val`) and the maximum value (`max_val`) in the provided array using Python's built-in `min()` and `max()` functions.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Difference**: The maximum difference is computed as the difference between the maximum and minimum values (`max_val - min_val`). This directly reflects the requirement to find the maximum difference between any two elements.

3. **Correctness in Functionality**: The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs:
   - For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
   - For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
   - For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Since the program correctly calculates the maximum difference for any given list of integers and matches the requirements outlined in the problem description, it is deemed correct.
