Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement described in the problem. The function `func_1(arr)` computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the array `arr` by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and returning their difference. 

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Finding Maximum and Minimum**: The function uses `max(arr)` to find the largest element and `min(arr)` to find the smallest element in the array. 
2. **Calculating Difference**: It then calculates the difference between these two values, which is the maximum difference possible between any two elements in the array.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Since `max` and `min` will return the same value if the array contains only one unique value or if the array has only one element, the function will return `0` in those cases, which is mathematically valid as the maximum difference in a single-element array is `0`.

Thus, the function fulfills the requirement to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, and therefore it is correct.
