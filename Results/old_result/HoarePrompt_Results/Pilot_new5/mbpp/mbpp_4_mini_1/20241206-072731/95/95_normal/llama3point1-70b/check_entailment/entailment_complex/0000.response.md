Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within that string. 

The use of the `str.count()` method directly fulfills the requirement to count occurrences, as it accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring. The additional clarification in the annotations that the function will return 0 if 'std' is not present or if the string is empty is consistent with the expected behavior for those input cases. 

Since the function adheres to the problem description without introducing any errors or incorrect behavior, it can be concluded that the implementation is correct.
