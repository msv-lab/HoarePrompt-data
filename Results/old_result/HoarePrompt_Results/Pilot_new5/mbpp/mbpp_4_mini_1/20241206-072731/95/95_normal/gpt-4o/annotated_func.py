#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.count('std')
    #The program returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the string 's'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within that string. It handles any input string, including empty strings, returning 0 if 'std' is not found.
