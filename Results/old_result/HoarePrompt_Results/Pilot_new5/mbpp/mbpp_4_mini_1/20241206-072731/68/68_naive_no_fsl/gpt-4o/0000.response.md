To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its functionality in relation to the problem description, which is to write a function to get the angle of a complex number.

The function `func_1(real, imag)` constructs a complex number from the `real` and `imag` parts and then returns the phase (angle) of that complex number using `cmath.phase()`. 

The assertions provided check specific cases:
1. For the complex number `0 + 1j`, the angle should indeed be `π/2` (or approximately `1.5707963267948966`).
2. For the complex number `2 + 1j`, the angle is approximately `0.4636476090008061`, which is correct.
3. For the complex number `0 + 2j`, the angle is again `π/2`, which is correct.

While the assertions cover certain cases, there are several potential edge cases and inputs that are not tested by these assertions:

1. If the input is `(0, 0)`, the result of `cmath.phase(0)` is undefined, and it typically returns `0.0`, which may not be what is expected when considering the undefined nature of the angle of a point at the origin.
2. If the input is a negative real number (like `(-1, 0)`), the angle should be `π`, but this is not verified in the assertions.
3. Similarly, for negative imaginary numbers, such as `(0, -1)`, the angle should be `-π/2`, which is not being tested.
4. Any complex number where both the `real` and `imag` parts are negative (like `(-1, -1)`) will yield an angle of `-3π/4`, which is not covered.

Given that the program fails to account for these scenarios (and because it can produce incorrect or undefined results for inputs like `(0, 0)`), we conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input is `(0, 0)` correctly and does not test a variety of complex numbers that could produce unexpected angles.
