#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase of the complex number created from the floating-point numbers `real` and `imag`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It returns the phase (or argument) of the complex number created from these parts. There are no edge cases or missing logic in this implementation, as the function will accurately compute the phase for any valid floating-point inputs.
