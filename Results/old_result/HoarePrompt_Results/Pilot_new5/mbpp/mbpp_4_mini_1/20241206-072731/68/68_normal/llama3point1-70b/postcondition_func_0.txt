The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It returns the phase (or argument) of the complex number created from these parts. There are no edge cases or missing logic in this implementation, as the function will accurately compute the phase for any valid floating-point inputs.
