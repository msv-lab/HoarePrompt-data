Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the angle (or phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The use of the `cmath.phase()` function is appropriate for this purpose, as it returns the angle in radians between the positive real axis and the line representing the complex number in the complex plane.

Testing various cases, including both positive and negative values for the real and imaginary parts, will yield correct angle calculations. For example:
- For `func_1(1, 1)`, the angle should be π/4 (45 degrees).
- For `func_1(-1, 1)`, the angle should be 3π/4 (135 degrees).
- For `func_1(-1, -1)`, the angle should be -3π/4 (-135 degrees).
- For `func_1(1, -1)`, the angle should be -π/4 (-45 degrees).
- For `func_1(0, 1)`, the angle should be π/2 (90 degrees).
- For `func_1(0, -1)`, the angle should be -π/2 (-90 degrees).

All these cases confirm that the implementation is correct for all potential inputs that could be passed to the function. Thus, the program satisfies the requirements of the problem description.
