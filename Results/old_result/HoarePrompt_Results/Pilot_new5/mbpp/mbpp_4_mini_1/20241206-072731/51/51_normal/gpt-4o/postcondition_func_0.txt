The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers (either integers or floats) and returns the product of all the numbers in the list divided by the length of the list. If any number in the list is zero, the product will be zero, and the result will consequently be zero regardless of the length. The function does not handle cases where the list might contain non-numeric types, which could lead to a TypeError during multiplication.
