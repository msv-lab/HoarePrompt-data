The value of `product` is updated by multiplying it with `num`. Since `product` is equal to `num`, the new value of `product` will be `num * num`, which simplifies to `num**2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num**2`, `num` must be the next element in the `numbers` list.**
