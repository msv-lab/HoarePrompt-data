Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, there are two main issues:

1. **Handling of Non-Numeric Types**: The problem description does not mention that the function should only handle lists of numbers. The provided function does not handle cases where the list might contain non-numeric types (e.g., strings, None, etc.). If such types are present in the list, the multiplication operation will raise a `TypeError`, which means the function will not produce a valid output.

2. **Division by Length**: While the function correctly computes the product of all numbers and divides by the length of the list, it assumes that the list contains only valid numeric types (which the problem does not guarantee). If the list is empty at any point (even though the pre-condition states it won't be), it would lead to a division by zero error.

In summary, the function fails to handle potential errors related to non-numeric types and lacks robust error checking, which means it does not adhere to the problem description's requirement that the function should operate correctly with any list of numbers. Therefore, the program is not correct.
