The code `product *= num` updates the value of `product` by multiplying it by `num`. Since `product` is initially equal to the second element of `numbers`, and `num` is also the second element of `numbers`, the value of `product` will be the square of the second element in `numbers`. The other variables, `numbers` and `num`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 elements, `product` is equal to the square of the second element of `numbers`, `num` is the second element in the list `numbers`.**
