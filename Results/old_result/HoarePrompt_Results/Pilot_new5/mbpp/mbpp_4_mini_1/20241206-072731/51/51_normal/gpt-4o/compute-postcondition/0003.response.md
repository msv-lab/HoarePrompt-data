According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `product` is equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, and `num` is the first number in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be updated to the next number in the list. If `numbers` is not empty and consists of more than one number, `num` will take on the value of the second number in the list. Therefore, the list must have at least 2 elements for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`product` is equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second number in the list**
