The variable `product` is updated by multiplying it by `num`. Since `product` is equal to `num` initially, the new value of `product` becomes `num * num`, which is `num**2`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, and `num` is the second number in the list `numbers`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `product` is equal to `num**2`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second number in the list.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num**2`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second number in the list.**
