Let's assess the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The function is expected to take a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})` and return a tuple of length `N` where each element at index `i` is equal to the product of `t_i` and `t_{i+1}`.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))

```

### Initial Assessment:
- The program uses `zip` to pair each element in the input tuple with its subsequent element.
- It then computes the product of these pairs and returns them as a tuple.
  
#### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Tuple**: If the input is an empty tuple `()`, the program will return an empty tuple, which is correct since there are no elements to multiply.
2. **Single Element Tuple**: If the input is a single element tuple `(t_1,)`, the program will also return an empty tuple, which aligns with the requirement since there are no adjacent elements to multiply.
3. **Multiple Elements**: For a tuple with two or more elements, the function should return a tuple of products as described.

### Output Hints:
The output hints indicate that the function accepts a tuple and returns a tuple of products of adjacent elements. It also states that if the input tuple has fewer than two elements, an empty tuple will be returned.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
- The output hints correctly describe the expected behavior of the function for both the empty tuple and single element tuple inputs.
- The function indeed returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements in the input tuple.

### Conclusion:
The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases: it returns the expected product of adjacent elements, and correctly handles edge cases of empty and single-element input tuples.

Correctness: **True**.
