#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a tuple of numbers with length N+1, where each element can be any numeric type.
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements in the 'numbers' tuple, where each element is multiplied by its next element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of numbers and returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements in the input tuple. If the input tuple has fewer than two elements, an empty tuple will be returned, as there are no adjacent elements to multiply.
