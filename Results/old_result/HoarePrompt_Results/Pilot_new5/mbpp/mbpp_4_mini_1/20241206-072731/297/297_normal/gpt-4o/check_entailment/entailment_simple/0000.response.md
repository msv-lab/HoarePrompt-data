Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `t` of numbers with length N+1 and generates a new tuple of length N. Each element of the resulting tuple is computed as the product of adjacent elements from the input tuple `t`.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. The function starts by taking a tuple `t` as input. 
2. The expression `tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))` generates a new tuple:
   - It iterates over the indices of the input tuple `t` from 0 to `len(t) - 2` (which corresponds to the first N elements).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates the product of the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` (i.e., `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]`).
3. The resulting products are collected into a new tuple and returned.

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases, including edge cases (like when the input has only one element, returning an empty tuple).

Overall, the implementation adheres strictly to the problem description and handles all specified scenarios.
