#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements from the original tuple 't' of numbers, where 't' has a length of N+1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with length N+1 and returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent elements from `t`. If `t` has a length of 1, it will return an empty tuple since there are no adjacent elements to multiply.
