To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the description and the implementation of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function is required to take a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})` and return a tuple of length `N` where the i-th element is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`. 

### Annotations on the Program:
- The function `func_1(t)` takes a tuple `t` and creates a new tuple containing the products of adjacent elements using a generator expression.
- It correctly handles the case where `t` has a length of 1 by returning an empty tuple, since there are no adjacent elements to multiply.

### Analysis of the Implementation:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function accepts a tuple `t`, and if its length is 1, it returns an empty tuple, which is consistent with the problem description since there's no adjacent element to multiply.

2. **Computation Logic**:
   - The line `tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))` correctly computes the products of adjacent elements:
     - For `t = (1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the products computed will be:
       - `1 * 5 = 5`
       - `5 * 7 = 35`
       - `7 * 8 = 56`
       - `8 * 10 = 80`
     - Resulting in the tuple `(5, 35, 56, 80)`, which matches the expected output.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function appears to handle edge cases correctly, such as:
     - When `t` has a length of 1, it returns `()`.
     - It works for tuples of varying lengths (greater than 1) and computes the products dynamically based on the input size.

### Conclusion:
The function meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly calculating the products of adjacent elements in the input tuple and handling the edge case of a single-element tuple appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
