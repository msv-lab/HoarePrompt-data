To determine the correctness of the function `func_1`, let's start by analyzing the given problem description and the provided implementation.

**Problem Description:**
The function should take a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})` and return a tuple of length `N`, where the `i`-th element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

**Implementation:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))
```

**Analysis:**
1. **Input Handling:** 
   - The function accepts a tuple, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Computation Logic:**
   - It uses the `zip` function to pair each element in `numbers` with the next element (i.e., `(t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3), ..., (t_N, t_{N+1})`).
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, it computes the product `a * b`.
   - Finally, it returns a tuple of these products.

3. **Output Length:**
   - The output is a tuple of length `N`, which is derived correctly since the input tuple has `N + 1` elements, resulting in `N` products from `zip`.

4. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   - If the input is an empty tuple `()`, the function may raise an error due to the absence of elements to zip.
   - If the input tuple has one element `(x,)`, the function will also return an empty tuple, which is technically correct but not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.
   - If the input tuple has two elements `(a, b)`, the function will return `(a * b,)`, which is also valid.

5. **General Cases:**
   - For larger tuples, such as `(1, 2, 3)`, it computes as expected: `1 * 2` producing `(2,)`, and similarly for other tuples.

Given the above analysis, the function works correctly for all valid cases as described in the problem statement, except it does not handle the case of an empty tuple properly, which can cause an error.

**Conclusion:**
Since the function does not handle the case of an empty tuple correctly, it violates the requirement to handle all potential cases described.

Correctness: **False**.
