Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension that iterates through each number in the input list and checks if the number is divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). This condition is the correct definition of even numbers. The program will work for any list of integers, including negative numbers and zero, as they are also considered in the context of evenness (e.g., -2 and 0 are even). Thus, I cannot find any case where it fails to meet the problem description.
