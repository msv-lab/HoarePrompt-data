Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to find even numbers from a list of numbers. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers.

2. **List Comprehension**: Within the function, a list comprehension is used to iterate over each number in the `numbers` list. The expression `num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0` filters the numbers, including only those that are even (i.e., numbers that yield a remainder of 0 when divided by 2).

3. **Correct Returns**: The function returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list. This aligns precisely with the problem description, which requires finding even numbers from a list.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program further demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for multiple test cases. Each assertion checks that the output of `func_1` is the correct list of even numbers for the provided input lists.

Since the function correctly identifies and returns even numbers as specified in the problem description, it is verified to be correct.
