To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given Initial State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has more than 1 element
- `trophies` remains unchanged
- `max_length` is equal to `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`
- `prev_start` is the start of the first sequence of 'G's in `trophies`
- `prev_end` is the end of the first sequence of 'G's in `trophies`

Code Snippet:
```python
curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
```

The code snippet assigns the value of `segments[i]` to the variables `curr_start` and `curr_end`. Since `i` is 1 and list indices in Python start at 0, this means `curr_start` and `curr_end` will be assigned the values of the second tuple in the `segments` list (because `i` equals 1, referencing the second element in a 0-indexed list).

Given that `segments` has more than one element and each element is a tuple representing a sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` will be the start index of the second sequence of 'G's, and `curr_end` will be the end index of the second sequence of 'G's.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has more than 1 element, `trophies` remains unchanged, `max_length` is equal to `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, `prev_start` is the start of the first sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end of the first sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` is the start of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_end` is the end of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`.**
