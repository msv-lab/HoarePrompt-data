Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original `trophies` string and has more than 1 element, `trophies` remains unchanged, if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is equal to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - prev_start + 2`, otherwise `max_length` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is the start of the first sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `prev_end` is the end of the first sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_start` is the start of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`, `curr_end` is the end of the second sequence of 'G's in `trophies`.**
