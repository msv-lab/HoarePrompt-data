To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The code updates the `max_beauty` variable by taking the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. 

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, and `right` is the last index plus one, these variables are not directly affected by the given code snippet. The value of `curr_beauty` is not specified in the initial state, but it is used to update `max_beauty`. 

Given that `max_beauty` was initially 0, after the execution of the code, `max_beauty` will be either 0 (if `curr_beauty` is less than or equal to 0) or `curr_beauty` (if `curr_beauty` is greater than 0). Without knowing the exact value of `curr_beauty`, we can conclude that `max_beauty` is now the maximum of its initial value (0) and `curr_beauty`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, `right` is the last index plus one.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, `right` is the last index plus one**
