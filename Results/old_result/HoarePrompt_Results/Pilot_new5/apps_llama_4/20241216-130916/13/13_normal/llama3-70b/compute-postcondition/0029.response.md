To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop statement.

The loop will execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `left < right`
2. `s[left]!= 'G'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` with at least one 'S' character and 'G' characters
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `max_beauty` is 0
- `right` is the current index plus 1
- `curr_beauty` is 0
- `left` is less than or equal to `right` and is `left + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The condition `left < right` must still be true. Since `left` is `left + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, to ensure `left < right`, no adjustment is strictly necessary here because the condition will be evaluated with the updated values of `left` and `right`. However, we must ensure that after the increment (`left + 1`), `left` does not exceed or equal `right`. Thus, the state regarding `left` and `right` should inherently satisfy this condition due to the nature of the loop, assuming `right` remains constant or is adjusted accordingly in the missing loop body.
  
- The condition `s[left]!= 'G'` must also be true. Given that `s[left]` is checked against 'G', and we know `s` contains at least one 'G' character, the only way to guarantee the loop can execute again is if we ensure that the next character checked (at the new `left` index after incrementing) is not 'G'. Since `golden` contains the indices of all 'G' characters in `s`, and `left` must be less than `right`, to ensure the loop can proceed, `left` should not point to an index in `golden` after its increment, unless there are 'G's beyond the current `right` index.

However, since the actual adjustment and checks within the loop body are omitted, we strictly focus on the conditions provided by the `while` loop statement. Given that `left` is incremented (`left + 1`), for the loop to continue, the next character must not be 'G', and `left` must remain less than `right`.

Thus, without making assumptions about the loop body, the state adjustments for the loop to potentially execute one more time are focused on ensuring the conditions `left < right` and `s[left]!= 'G'` can be met, given the provided and inferred conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with at least one 'S' character and 'G' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is greater than the new `left` index, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left` is such that `s[left]` is not 'G' after the increment**
