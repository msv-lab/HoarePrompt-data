According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 1`, which ensures that the loop will execute, but `j` needs to be defined as `i-1` for the loop to start. Additionally, since `i` is greater than 2, `i-1` will be at least 1 when the loop starts, but we also need to consider the case when `i` is equal to `n-1` to ensure the loop can execute when `n` is greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 1`, `beauty` is 1, `j` is `i - 1`**
