To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's logic and how it affects the variables `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, and `right`.

1. **`n`**: This is the length of the string `s` and does not change throughout the loop. Its value remains an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).

2. **`s`**: This is the input string consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters. Like `n`, `s` does not change throughout the execution of the loop.

3. **`golden`**: This is a list of indices of all 'G' characters in `s`. The loop does not modify `golden`, so its value remains the same throughout.

4. **`max_beauty`**: Initially set to 0, `max_beauty` is updated whenever `curr_beauty` is reset to 0 after encountering an 'S' character in `s`, but only if `curr_beauty` is greater than `max_beauty` at that point. After the loop finishes, `max_beauty` will hold the maximum number of consecutive 'G' characters encountered in `s` before an 'S' character.

5. **`curr_beauty`**: This variable keeps track of the current number of consecutive 'G' characters. It is incremented when a 'G' character is encountered and reset to 0 (and potentially update `max_beauty`) when an 'S' character is encountered. After the loop, if the string `s` ends with one or more 'G' characters, `curr_beauty` will hold the count of these consecutive 'G' characters. If `s` ends with an 'S' character, `curr_beauty` will be 0 because it gets reset upon encountering an 'S'.

6. **`left`**: This variable is used to track the position of the last 'G' character seen before an 'S' character. It moves forward whenever an 'S' is encountered and there are no 'G' characters before it (within the current `right` index), essentially trying to find the next 'G' to the left of or at the current `right` index after an 'S' is encountered.

7. **`right`**: This is the loop variable, ranging from 0 to `n-1`. After the loop finishes, `right` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire string `s`.

Given the above analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

- `n` remains unchanged, an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` remains unchanged, a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
- `golden` remains unchanged, a list of indices of all 'G' characters in `s`.
- `max_beauty` will hold the maximum number of consecutive 'G' characters found in `s` before an 'S' character.
- `curr_beauty` will either be 0 (if `s` ends with an 'S') or hold the count of consecutive 'G' characters at the end of `s` (if `s` ends with one or more 'G' characters).
- `left` will be at the index of the last 'G' character seen or will have moved past the last 'S' character to the next 'G' character or to the end of `s` if no more 'G' characters are found.
- `right` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has completed iterating over `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G' characters before an 'S', `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, and `right` equals `n`.**
