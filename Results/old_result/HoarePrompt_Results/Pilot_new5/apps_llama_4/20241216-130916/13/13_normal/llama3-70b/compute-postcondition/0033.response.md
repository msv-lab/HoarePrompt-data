Based on the provided information and the loop code, we can analyze the output state after the loop has finished executing.

The loop continues to execute as long as `left` is less than `right` and the character at the `left` index in the string `s` is not 'G'. In each iteration, `left` is incremented by 1.

The loop will terminate when either `left` is no longer less than `right` or the character at the `left` index is 'G'.

After the loop has finished executing, the value of `left` will be either equal to `right` or it will be pointing to the index of the next 'G' character in the string `s`.

Since `right` is the current index plus 1, and the loop increments `left` until it reaches the next 'G' or exceeds `right`, the final value of `left` will be the index of the next 'G' character in the string `s` if it exists, or it will be equal to `right` if there are no more 'G' characters.

Other variables such as `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` do not change during the loop execution, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the output state after the loop has finished executing is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left` is either equal to `right` or it is the index of the next 'G' character in `s`.**
