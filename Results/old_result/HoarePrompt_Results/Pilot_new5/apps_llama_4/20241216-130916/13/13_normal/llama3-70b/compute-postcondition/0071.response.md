The `break` statement terminates the loop that it is directly inside, but it does not change the values of the variables. The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as before the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`, `i` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `i - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
