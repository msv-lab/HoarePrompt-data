The code increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. The previous value of `curr_beauty` was 0, so the new value of `curr_beauty` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 1, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the last index plus one of `s`, and the current value of `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `right` if no 'G' is found or the end of `s` is reached, and `left` is less than `right`.**
