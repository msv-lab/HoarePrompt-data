The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` was either the previous beauty + 1 (if `s[j]` is 'G') or the total count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `i - 1` and moving backwards, or 1 if the loop did not execute. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S', `beauty` is the previous `beauty` + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.
