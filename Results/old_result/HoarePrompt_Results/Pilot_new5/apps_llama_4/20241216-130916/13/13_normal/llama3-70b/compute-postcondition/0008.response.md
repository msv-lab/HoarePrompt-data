The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `curr_beauty` was 0, so the new value of `curr_beauty` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is 0, the current value of `right` is such that the character at index `right` in `s` is 'G', `right` is at a valid index in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is 0, the current value of `right` is such that the character at index `right` in `s` is 'G', `right` is at a valid index in `s`**
