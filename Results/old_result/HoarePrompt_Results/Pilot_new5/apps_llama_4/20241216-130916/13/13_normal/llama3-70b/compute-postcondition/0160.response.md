The `print` statement is executed, which outputs the maximum value between `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. The value of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` are not changed, but their maximum value is printed. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains the maximum beauty score of 'G' characters that can be achieved by swapping one 'G' with an 'S' in `s`, or 0 if no 'G' is followed by 'S', and other variables retain their values.
The `print` statement returns `None` but the output is the maximum of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty score of 'G' characters that can be achieved by swapping one 'G' with an 'S' in `s`, or 0 if no 'G' is followed by 'S', the output is `max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap)`, and other variables (`max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `right`, `i`) retain their values as per their last updates before or within the loop, with `i` being `n-1`**
