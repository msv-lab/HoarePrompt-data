To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`
- `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`
- `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character
- `right` equals `n`
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`
- `i` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is 'G'
- `s[i + 1]` is 'S'
- `j` is `i - 2`
- If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is the previous value of `beauty` plus 1, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

Loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop variable `j` and its range. The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from `i - 1` down to `-1` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `i - 3`. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`, `i` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `i - 3`**
