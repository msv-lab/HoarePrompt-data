The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1` or `start + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S' and `trophies[i-1]` must be 'G', `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `start` is equal to `i - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S' and `trophies[i-1]` must be 'G', `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `start` is equal to `i - 1`**
