To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```
The loop starts from `i - 1` and decrements `j` until it reaches `-1` or encounters an 'S' character in the string `s`.

From the provided output states, we can observe the following patterns:

- The loop iterates over the string `s` from the current index `i - 1` towards the beginning of the string.
- The variable `beauty` is incremented by `1` for each 'G' character encountered during the iteration.
- The loop breaks as soon as it encounters an 'S' character.
- The index `j` represents the current position in the string `s` during the iteration.

After analyzing the loop code and the output states, we can conclude that the loop will execute until it encounters an 'S' character or reaches the beginning of the string `s`.

The output state after all iterations of the loop have finished will be:
- `n` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `s` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `golden` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `max_beauty` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `curr_beauty` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `left` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `right` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `j` will be the index of the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of the string `s`, or `-1` if no 'S' character is found.
- `beauty` will be the count of 'G' characters encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of the string `s` until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1, `i` is greater than 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is the index of the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of `s`, or `-1` if no 'S' character is found, and `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of `s`.**
