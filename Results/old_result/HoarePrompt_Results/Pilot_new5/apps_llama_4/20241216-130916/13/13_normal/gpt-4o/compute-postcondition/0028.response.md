Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'. If the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'G', then `start` is the initial value of `i`, `i` is either `n` or the index of the first 'S' encountered after `start`, and `segments` is updated with the tuple (`start`, `i - 1`), otherwise `i` is `i + 1`. If the character at index 0 in `trophies` is 'G', then the old `i` was less than `n`, otherwise the character at index 0 in `trophies` is 'S' and the old `i` was 1. The character at the old index `i` in `trophies` is either 'G' and the conditions for `start`, `i`, and `segments` are met, or it is 'S' and `i` is incremented by 1.***
