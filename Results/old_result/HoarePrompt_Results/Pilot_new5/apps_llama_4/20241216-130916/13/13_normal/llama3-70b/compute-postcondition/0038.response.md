According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the current value of `right`. If `right` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `right` is the last index that was processed. For the loop to execute again, `right` needs to be incremented by 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the last index plus one**
