Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers updated from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k with t > k. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, then `k` has been printed. Otherwise, `n` is updated to a new integer value, `k` is updated to a new integer value, `t` is updated to a new integer value with the conditions 1 ≤ t < n + k, t > k, and t > n, and the output is `n + k - t`.***
