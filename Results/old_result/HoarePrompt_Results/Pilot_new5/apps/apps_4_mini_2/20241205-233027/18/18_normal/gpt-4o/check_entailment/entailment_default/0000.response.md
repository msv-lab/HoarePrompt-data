To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I'll analyze the code and consider the potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. There are `n` spectators in a stadium.
2. Spectators stand at times 1 through `k`, with a maximum of `k` spectators standing.
3. After time `k`, as each new spectator stands, the first spectator sits, and this continues until time `n + k`.
4. The goal is to return the number of spectators standing at time `t`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k)
    else:
        print(n + k - t)
```

**Logic Assessment:**
- **Case 1 (`t <= k`)**: The spectators' standing count increases linearly. The output `t` is correct because it represents the number of spectators standing at that time.
  
- **Case 2 (`t <= n`)**: Up to `n`, the maximum number of standing spectators is `k`, hence printing `k` is correct.

- **Case 3 (`t > n`)**: After all `n` spectators have stood up, the program computes the number of spectators still standing as `n + k - t`. This is also correct because it reflects the decrease in standing spectators as they start sitting down in reverse order.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The program correctly handles all cases as per the given problem description. There are no cases where it would lead to incorrect outputs for valid inputs within the specified constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `1 ≤ t < n + k`).

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints suggest:
- If `t <= k`, output should be `t`.
- If `k < t <= n`, output should be `k`.
- If `n < t < n + k`, output should be `n + k - t`.

The logic in the hints aligns perfectly with the program's logic and confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given problem description.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the code against the problem description and examining the output hints, the program appears to handle all cases correctly without missing any edge cases specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**.
