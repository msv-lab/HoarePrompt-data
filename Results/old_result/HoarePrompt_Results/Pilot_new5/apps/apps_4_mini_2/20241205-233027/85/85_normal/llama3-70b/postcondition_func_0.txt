The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) from the user. It calculates how many pairs of integers `(i, n - i)` exist such that `i` is in the range from 1 to `n // 2`, and the sum of these pairs is divisible by the largest power of ten less than or equal to that sum. The result is printed as the count of such pairs.
