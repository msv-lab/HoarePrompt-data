Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

### Issues:
1. The program attempts to find the maximum number of trailing nines in the total cost by dividing `n` and checking if `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. However, this logic is flawed as it does not consider all possible pairs of shovels and their sums.
2. The calculation of pairs as `(n + 1) * max_9s` does not accurately reflect the number of valid pairs leading to totals that end with nines.

### Counterexample:
For `n = 7`, the expected output is `3` because:
- Valid pairs are (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5) which all yield sums ending with one nine.
The program, however, will not produce the correct output as it does not implement a correct logic for pairing shovels.

Thus, the logic in the code does not align with the requirements of the problem, leading to incorrect outputs.
