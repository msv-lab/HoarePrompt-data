Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `remaining_after_houses` is at least (car_cost * (remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)), `b` is (remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1), and `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1) * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions for purchasing cars with the given remaining amount after houses are satisfied.***
