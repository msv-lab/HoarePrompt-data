The variable `remaining_after_houses` is assigned the value of `n - a * house_cost`. Given that `a` is 0, the equation simplifies to `remaining_after_houses = n - 0 * house_cost`, which results in `remaining_after_houses = n`. The values of `n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`.**
