`remaining_after_cars` is calculated as `remaining_after_houses` minus `b * car_cost`, where `b` is determined as `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. Thus, `b` represents the number of cars that can be bought plus one extra car. The state of `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged, and `remaining_after_cars` will be updated based on the equation. 

Output State: **`remaining_after_houses` is unchanged, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1) * car_cost`**
