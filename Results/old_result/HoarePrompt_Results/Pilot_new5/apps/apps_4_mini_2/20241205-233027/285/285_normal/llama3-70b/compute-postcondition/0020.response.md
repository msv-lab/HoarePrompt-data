To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided state and the for loop statement step by step.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).
- `a` is 1.
- `b` is calculated as \( (n - 1 * 1234567) // 123456 \).
- `c` is calculated as \( (n - 1 * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234 \).

The for loop statement is:
```
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Range**:
   The loop's range is determined by the expression \( (n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 \).
   Since \( a = 1 \), this simplifies to \( (n - 1234567) // 123456 + 1 \).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   For the range to be valid (i.e., for the loop to execute at least once), the expression \( (n - 1234567) // 123456 \) must be greater than or equal to 0. Thus:
   \[
   n - 1234567 \geq 0 \implies n \geq 1234567
   \]
   If \( n \) is less than \( 1234567 \), the range will evaluate to a negative number or zero, causing the loop to not execute.

3. **Adjusting State**:
   Thus, to guarantee that the loop executes, `n` must be adjusted to ensure it is at least \( 1234567 \). Additionally, since `b` is being overwritten in the loop declaration, we must also acknowledge that the loop will start with `b` equal to 0.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` must be at least 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is now 0**.
