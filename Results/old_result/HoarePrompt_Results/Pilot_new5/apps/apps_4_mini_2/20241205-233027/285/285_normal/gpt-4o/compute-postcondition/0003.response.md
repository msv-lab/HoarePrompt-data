To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the `for` loop statement. The loop is dependent on the variable `n` and the expression `n // house_cost + 1`.

1. **Understanding the Loop Conditions**: 
   - The loop will execute as long as the value of `a` is in the range from `0` to `(n // house_cost)`, inclusive.
   - The expression `n // house_cost` calculates how many whole `house_cost` can fit into `n`. Therefore, the loop will run for `a` values starting from `0` up to `n // house_cost`.

2. **Evaluating `house_cost`**:
   - Given that `house_cost` is 1234567, if `n` is less than `house_cost`, `n // house_cost` will yield `0`, leading to the loop executing only once (for `a = 0`).

3. **Determining Valid States**:
   - Since `n` is a positive integer and can be as small as `1`, if `n` is less than `house_cost`, the loop will still execute but only a single iteration will occur (for `a = 0`).
   - We need to note that `a` will start from `0` since the range is inclusive from `0`.

4. **Final State**:
   - `n` must be at least `1` (which it is, since it's a positive integer).
   - `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` have fixed values and do not affect the variable `a` in this context.
   - Upon the first execution, `a` will be `0` (the first iteration).

Thus, the required state modifications for the loop to execute properly are straightforward.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0**
