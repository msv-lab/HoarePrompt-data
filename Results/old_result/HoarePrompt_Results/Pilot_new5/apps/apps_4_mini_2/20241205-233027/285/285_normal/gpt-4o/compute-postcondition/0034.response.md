Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - 1234567`, `b` is equal to the maximum number of cars that can be purchased with the remaining amount after houses, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, and if there exists at least one `b` such that `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function can return 'YES'. If no such `b` exists, the loop completes without finding a valid configuration, and the function does not return a value.**
