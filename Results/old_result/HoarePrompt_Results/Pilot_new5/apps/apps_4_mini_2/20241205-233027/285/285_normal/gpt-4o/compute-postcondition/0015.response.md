To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the effect of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `remaining_after_houses` must be at least `(car_cost * (remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1))`.
- `b` is calculated as `(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`.

The code modifies the value of `remaining_after_cars` as follows:
```
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```

1. `b` is already defined as `(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`.
2. The calculation for `remaining_after_cars` will be based on the current values of `remaining_after_houses` and `b`.
3. Since `b` is defined in relation to `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is determined by subtracting the product of `b` and `car_cost` from `remaining_after_houses`.

Therefore, we need to update the output state to reflect the change to `remaining_after_cars`, while retaining the relevant context of the other variables:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `remaining_after_houses` must be at least (car_cost * (remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)), `b` is (remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1), `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1) * car_cost`.**
