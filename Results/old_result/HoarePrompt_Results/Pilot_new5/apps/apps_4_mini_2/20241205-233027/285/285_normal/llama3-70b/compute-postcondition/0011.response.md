The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program execution. As a result, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but we break out of any ongoing execution. Therefore, the output state includes the information that the program has exited without changing any variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to `(n - 123456) // 1234; the program has exited.**
