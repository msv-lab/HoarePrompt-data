Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and reads a positive integer `n` from user input. It checks if it is possible to express `n` as a sum of non-negative multiples of `1234567`, `123456`, and `1234`. If such a combination exists, it prints 'YES' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'NO' after all combinations have been checked. **
