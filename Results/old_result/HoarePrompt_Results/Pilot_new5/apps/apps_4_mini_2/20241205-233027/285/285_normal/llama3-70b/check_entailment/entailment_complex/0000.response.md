Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from user input, which is within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

2. **Combination Search**: The program uses a nested loop structure to check for all non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that:
   - `a` represents the number of houses bought,
   - `b` represents the number of cars bought,
   - `c` represents the number of computers bought.
   
   The outer loop iterates over possible values of `a` (from 0 to `n // 1234567`), and for each value of `a`, the inner loop iterates over possible values of `b` (from 0 to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`). 

3. **Calculating `c`**: Within the inner loop, `c` is calculated based on the remaining game-coins after accounting for the contributions from houses and cars. Specifically, `c` is determined by the remaining amount after subtracting the total spent on houses and cars, divided by the cost of one computer.

4. **Validation**: The condition `if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:` checks whether the combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` indeed sums up to `n`. If such a combination is found, it prints 'YES' and exits the program.

5. **Exhaustiveness**: If the program exhausts all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` without finding a valid solution, it prints 'NO'. This ensures that every possible way to use the game-coins is considered.

The program effectively checks all combinations of non-negative integers for houses, cars, and computers and correctly prints 'YES' if a valid combination exists and 'NO' otherwise, fulfilling the requirements laid out in the problem description. Thus, it is correct.
