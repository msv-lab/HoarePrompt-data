According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b` and the expression `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than this expression.

At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0, and we know that `n` is at least 1234567. The expression evaluates to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`, which simplifies to `(n - 1234567) // 123456 + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `b` must be less than the value of the expression when `b` is incremented. 

Since `b` is currently 0, it will be 1 for the next iteration. So we must ensure that:

1. The expression must be at least `2` (because `b` will be `1`, thus `b < 2`).
2. The value of the expression, `(n - 1234567) // 123456 + 1`, must be greater than `1`, meaning `(n - 1234567) // 123456` must be at least `1`.

This condition implies that `n` must be at least `1234567 + 123456`, which means `n` must be at least `1358023` for the loop to run again after this iteration as `b` is incremented to `1`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is at least `1358023`, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `c` is calculated as `(n - 1234567) // 1234`.**
