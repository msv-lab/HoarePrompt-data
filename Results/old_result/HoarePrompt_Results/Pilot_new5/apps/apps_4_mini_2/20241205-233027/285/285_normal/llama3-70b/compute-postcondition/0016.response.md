The `exit()` function halts the execution of the program immediately. No values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c` are changed or returned, but the program execution will stop at this point. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `a` is 0; `b` is 2; `c` is equal to `(n - 246912) // 1234` and 'YES' has been printed; program execution has been halted.**
