The code `print('YES')` outputs the string 'YES' to the console, but it does not modify any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to `(n - 123456) // 1234`.**
