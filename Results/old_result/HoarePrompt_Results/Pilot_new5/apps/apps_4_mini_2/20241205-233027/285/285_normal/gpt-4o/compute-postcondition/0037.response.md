To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   The `for` loop iterates over `b` in the range defined by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be non-negative. This means that `remaining_after_houses` must be at least as large as `car_cost`.

2. **Calculating `remaining_after_houses`**:
   We know that:
   - `remaining_after_houses = n - 2469134`
   - Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1234567, we can calculate `remaining_after_houses`:
     - If `n = 1234567`, then `remaining_after_houses = 1234567 - 2469134 = -1234567`.
     - If `n = 2469134`, then `remaining_after_houses = 2469134 - 2469134 = 0`.
     - If `n` is any value greater than `2469134`, `remaining_after_houses` will be positive.

3. **Relating `remaining_after_houses` to `car_cost`**:
   We know that `car_cost` is `123456`. For the loop to execute, we need:
   - `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` to be greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Conditions for Executing the Loop**:
   - Therefore, we need `remaining_after_houses` to be at least `0`, which occurs when `n` is at least `2469134`.
   - Furthermore, for the loop to execute correctly, the value of `b` should start from `0`.

5. **Final State Adjustments**:
   - The key conditions are that `n` must be at least `2469134`, and we need to ensure that `b` starts at `0`.

Now, let's summarize the state:

State: **`n` is at least 2469134, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is 0 (if `n` is exactly 2469134) or positive if `n` is greater than `2469134`, `remaining_after_cars` is calculated accordingly.**
