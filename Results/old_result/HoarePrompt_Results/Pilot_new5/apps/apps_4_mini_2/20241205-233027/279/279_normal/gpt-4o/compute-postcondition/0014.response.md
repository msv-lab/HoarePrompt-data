The variable `x` is assigned the value of `p[x] - 1`. Since it's stated that `x` must be less than `n` and `p` is a list of integers with length `n`, the new value of `x` will depend on the value at index `x` in the list `p`. This means `x` will be updated, but the previous state of `x`, along with the other variables, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers with length `n`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list with `visited[x]` equal to `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing the value `x`, `x` is now equal to `p[x] - 1`.**
