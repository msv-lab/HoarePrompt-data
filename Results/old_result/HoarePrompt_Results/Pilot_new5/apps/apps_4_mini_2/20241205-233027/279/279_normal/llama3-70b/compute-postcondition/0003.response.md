The value of `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. The output state indicates that `ans` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers based on the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on the input, `ans` is 0**
