Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers with length `n`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n`, and `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`. If `visited[i]` is False, then all elements of `visited` become `True`, `cycles` contains the previous cycles plus the new `cycle`, which reflects the sequence of indices visited during the loop, and `x` is equal to the last value of `p[x] - 1` that led to a repeated visit or an exit condition.***
