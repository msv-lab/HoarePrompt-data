The statement `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. The state of `cycle` is affected by this operation, while all other variables remain unchanged. The variable `cycle` will now include the value of `x` in its list.

Since `visited[x]` is True, it implies that `x` is a valid index for the list `cycle` and there are no issues regarding the length of the list or the validity of the index.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `p` must be adjusted such that `p[1]` is not equal to 2, `visited[x]` is True, `b` is a list of integers with length `n`, `cycles` contains the previous cycles, and `cycle` now includes the value `x`.**
