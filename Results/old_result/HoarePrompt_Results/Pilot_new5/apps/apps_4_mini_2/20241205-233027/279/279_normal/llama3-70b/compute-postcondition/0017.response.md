The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), and the lists `p` and `b` are unchanged. The variable `i` retains its value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, `ans` is incremented by 1, `i` is n**
