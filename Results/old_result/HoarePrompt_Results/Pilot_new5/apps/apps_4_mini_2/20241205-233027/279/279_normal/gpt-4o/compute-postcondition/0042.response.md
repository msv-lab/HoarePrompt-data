The code `cycles.append(cycle)` adds the `cycle` list to the `cycles` list. The `visited`, `x`, `p`, and `b` variables remain unchanged. The `cycles` list will now contain the previous cycles along with the newly appended `cycle`. The overall structure of the lists is maintained, and the values of `visited`, `x`, `p`, and `b` do not change.

Output State: **`visited` contains `True` for all nodes in the cycle starting from index 1, `x` is equal to the last visited index from the cycle, `cycle` contains all the indices from the cycle starting from 1, `p` is a list of integers with length `n`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `cycles` now contains the previous cycles along with the newly appended `cycle`.**
