The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\). `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length equal to `n`. 

The function's output is determined by the following cases:
- Case_1: If certain conditions based on `b` and the permutation `p` are met, the function returns a specific result (the exact output is not detailed).
- Case_2: If the conditions for Case_1 are not met, the function checks for another set of conditions and returns a different result.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a permutation list `p`, and a binary list `b`, and to return results based on specific conditions evaluated from these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a permutation list p, and a binary list b, returning results based on evaluated conditions from these inputs.**
