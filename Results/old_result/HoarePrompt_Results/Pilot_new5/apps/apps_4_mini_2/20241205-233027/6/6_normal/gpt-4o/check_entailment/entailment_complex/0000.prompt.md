You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), pos is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), l is an integer representing the left index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and r is an integer representing the right index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n).
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if (l == 1 and r == n) :
        print(0)
    else :
        if (l == 1) :
            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
        else :
            if (r == n) :
                print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
            else :
                move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
                move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
                close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
                print(close_both_sides)
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers representing the number of tabs, the current cursor position, and the left and right indices of the segment that needs to remain open, respectively. If `r` is equal to `n`, the value printed is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `n`, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)` and `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`; `close_both_sides` is printed as the minimum of `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers representing the number of tabs, the current cursor position, and the left and right indices of the segment that needs to remain open, respectively. If `l` is equal to 1, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. Otherwise, if `r` is equal to `n`, the printed value is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If `r` is less than `n`, the program calculates `move_to_l` as `abs(pos - l)` and `move_to_r` as `abs(pos - r)`, and prints `close_both_sides` as the minimum of `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers representing the number of tabs, the current cursor position, and the left and right indices of the segment that needs to remain open, respectively. If `l` is equal to 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the entire segment of tabs from 1 to `n` remains open and the output printed is 0. If `l` is equal to 1, the output printed is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `r` is equal to `n`, the output printed is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If `r` is less than `n`, the program calculates `move_to_l` as `abs(pos - l)` and `move_to_r` as `abs(pos - r)`, and prints `close_both_sides` as the minimum of `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers: `n` (total number of tabs), `pos` (current cursor position), `l` (left index of the segment that needs to remain open), and `r` (right index of the segment that needs to remain open). It prints the minimum number of moves required to close the tabs outside the segment [l, r], based on the current cursor position. If the entire range of tabs (from 1 to n) is to remain open, it returns 0. If `l` is 1, it computes the distance from `pos` to `r` and adds one. If `r` is n, it computes the distance from `pos` to `l` and adds one. If both `l` and `r` are within the bounds of the tabs, it calculates the moves to both ends of the segment and takes the minimum total move required to close the remaining tabs. All inputs are constrained to valid ranges.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
