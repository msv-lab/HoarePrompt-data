To determine the output state after the execution of the code snippet, we need to calculate the value of `close_both_sides` using the provided variables:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
   - `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n)
   - `l` is an integer representing the left index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n)
   - `r` is an integer representing the right index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n)
   - `l` is greater than 1 or `r` is less than `n`; and `r` is less than `n`
   - `move_to_l` is equal to abs(pos - l)
   - `move_to_r` is equal to abs(pos - r)

2. The formula for `close_both_sides` is:
   ```
   close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
   ```

3. We will calculate `close_both_sides` based on the defined variables:
   - `move_to_l = abs(pos - l)`
   - `move_to_r = abs(pos - r)`

4. After calculating `close_both_sides`, the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`, `move_to_l`, and `move_to_r` remain unchanged, but we will add the new variable `close_both_sides`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the newly computed variable.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of tabs (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `pos` is an integer representing the current cursor position (1 ≤ pos ≤ n); `l` is an integer representing the left index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `r` is an integer representing the right index of the segment that needs to remain open (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n); `l` is greater than 1 or `r` is less than n; `r` is less than `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to abs(pos - l); `move_to_r` is equal to abs(pos - r); `close_both_sides` is equal to min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2)).**
