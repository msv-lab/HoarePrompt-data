`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that must be an integer between 1 and 100000. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, after the assignment `m` holds the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, where `m` is the value of the input integer.**
