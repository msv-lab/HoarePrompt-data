Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `(5 * m + 5) // 2 - 1`, `result` remains an empty list, and `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 with `zeroes` still equal to or greater than `m`. Otherwise, `left` is calculated as (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 - `k`, `mid` remains the same, `result` is populated with values from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and `right` is determined as (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 + (n + 1), while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
