The code `left -= 1` decreases the value of `left` by 1. The previous value of `left` is `(5 * m + 5) // 2 - 2`, and after the operation, `left` will be equal to `(5 * m + 5) // 2 - 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is `(5 * m + 5) // 2 - 3`; and `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is `(5 * m + 5) // 2 - 3`; and `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.**
