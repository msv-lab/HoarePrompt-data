Based on the information provided, we can analyze the output state after the while loop executes. 

In this case, the loop continues to execute as long as `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. Since `left` is decremented in each iteration, we can determine the output state based on how many times the loop can run before the condition fails.

Output State after the loop executes some number of times: 

1. After 1 execution: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is an empty list; `left` is adjusted to (low + high) // 2 - 1; and `func_1(left)` must be equal to `m`.
2. After 2 executions: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is an empty list; `left` is decremented further to (low + high) // 2 - 2; and `func_1(left)` still equals `m`.
3. After 3 executions: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is an empty list; `left` is decremented again to (low + high) // 2 - 3; and `func_1(left)` remains equal to `m`.

So, upon final execution, we can conclude: 

1. The loop continues until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, therefore `left` will eventually be decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.
2. When the loop exits, `left` will be one less than the last value where `func_1(left)` was still equal to `m`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `left` is the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` minus 1, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `result` is an empty list.**
