Output State: **`func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `left` is the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` minus 1, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, having been incremented several times during the loop.**
