The value of `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. The initial value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, updating `low` to `mid + 1` ensures that `low` becomes strictly greater than `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`; `high` remains unchanged; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value of `func_1(mid)`.**
