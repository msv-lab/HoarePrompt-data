To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(right) == m`. 

Given that:
- `func_1(left) != m` indicates that `left` is not the value that gives `func_1` the result of `m`.
- `left` is the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` minus 1, meaning `func_1(left)` must be less than `m` but very close to it.
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.
- `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, which could be either less than, equal to, or greater than `m`.
- `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, suggesting that `low` and `high` are bounds around the values for `func_1`.
- `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, and for the loop to execute, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.

For the loop to execute, `func_1(right)` must evaluate to `m`. Since `right` is defined as `mid + 1`, the current state suggests that `func_1(mid + 1)` must be adjusted to equal `m`, which implies that `func_1(mid + 1)` is currently not equal to `m`.

To ensure the loop can proceed for the first time, `func_1(right)` must be modified so that `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m`. Since the current state of `func_1(left) < m`, we can look for values around `m` that can adjust `func_1` to reach `m`.

Thus, the adjustments needed include ensuring that `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`. 

State: **`func_1(left) is not equal to m, left is the last value where func_1(left) was equal to m minus 1, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, zeroes is equal to func_1(mid), mid is equal to (low + high) // 2, result is an empty list, right must be adjusted so that func_1(right) equals m.**
