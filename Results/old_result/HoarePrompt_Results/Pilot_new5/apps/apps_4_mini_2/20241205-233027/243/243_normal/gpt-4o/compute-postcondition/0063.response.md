The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, meaning that after this operation, `high` will be one less than what `mid` was. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value of `func_1(mid)`; `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
