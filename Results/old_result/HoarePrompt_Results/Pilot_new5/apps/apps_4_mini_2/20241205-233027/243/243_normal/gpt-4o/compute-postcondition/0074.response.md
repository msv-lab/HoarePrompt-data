According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m`. 

Right before the loop, we know that `left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, which suggests that there are still values for `right` that could potentially result in `func_1(right)` equaling `m`. However, we also know that `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, which implies that the function is not returning the desired value at that point.

To guarantee that the loop executes at least one time, we can adjust the state of `right` such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`. Given `right` is currently equal to `mid + 1`, we must ensure that `func_1(mid + 1)` is equal to `m` or potentially adjust `mid` or other parameters to ensure the condition holds true.

Thus, the requirement for `func_1(right)` must hold true. We need to ensure that after evaluating `func_1(right)` that it equals `m`.

State: **`left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `right` must be adjusted so that `func_1(right) == m`**
