The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The current value of `mid` is calculated as (5 * `m` + 5) // 2. Since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `mid` will also be a positive integer, and therefore `low` will be updated to a value greater than its previous value.

Since `high`, `result`, `zeroes`, and the condition regarding `zeroes` being less than `m` are not affected by this line of code, they will remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is now (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 + 1; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; the current value of `zeroes` is less than `m`.**
