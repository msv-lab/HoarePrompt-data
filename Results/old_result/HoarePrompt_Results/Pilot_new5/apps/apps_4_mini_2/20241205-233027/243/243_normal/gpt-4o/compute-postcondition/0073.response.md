The value of `right` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The variable `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and since `left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, we know that `mid` is at least `left + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is equal to `mid + 1`.**
