The value of `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is previously defined as `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` remains unchanged. The value of `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, which is also unchanged. 

After executing the code, the output state will reflect the new value of `low` and retain the other variable states, with `low` being incremented by 1.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2; low` is equal to `mid + 1`.**
