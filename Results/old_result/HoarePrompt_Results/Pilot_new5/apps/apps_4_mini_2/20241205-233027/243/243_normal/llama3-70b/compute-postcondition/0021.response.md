The code `break` stops the execution of the current loop or conditional block, but it does not change the values of any variables. The previous values of the affected variables are:

- If `m` is 1, `count` is 0.
- If `m` is greater than 1, `count` is 1.
- `n` is 1.
- `ans` is an empty list.

Since the values of the variables do not change, the output state remains the same regarding `m`, `count`, `n`, and `ans`.

Output State: **If m is 1, `count` is 0; if m is greater than 1, `count` is 1; `n` is 1; `ans` is an empty list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
