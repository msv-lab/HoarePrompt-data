According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(right)` must still be equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `func_1(left) is not equal to m`, indicating that `right` was increased by 1 in that iteration. However, we don't have information about the current value of `func_1(right)` after this increment. Since `right` is now one more than it was previously, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` remains equal to `m` for the loop to execute again.

Since we can't make assumptions about the behavior of `func_1`, we can't definitively say what the state of `right` will yield. Therefore, we need to modify the state to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we can state that `func_1(right)` must currently equal to `m`.

State: **`func_1(left) is not equal to m, left is the last value where func_1(left) was equal to m minus 1, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, zeroes is equal to func_1(mid), mid is equal to (low + high) // 2, result is an empty list, right is increased by 1, and func_1(right) must be equal to m`**
