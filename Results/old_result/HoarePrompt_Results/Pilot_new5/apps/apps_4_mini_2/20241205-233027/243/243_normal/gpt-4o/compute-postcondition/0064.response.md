In the provided code, a new variable `result` is assigned an empty list. This does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, we maintain the values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `zeroes` as they are, while noting that `result` has been initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list.**
