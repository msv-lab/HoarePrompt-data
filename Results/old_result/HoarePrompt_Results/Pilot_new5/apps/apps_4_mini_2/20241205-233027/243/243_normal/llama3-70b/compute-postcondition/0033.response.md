The code `ans.append(n)` adds the current value of `n` to the list `ans`. The initial state indicates that `ans` contains previous elements plus the current value of `n`, and since `n` is an ambiguous integer, it may not have a fixed value. However, `ans` will now include that current value of `n` in its list.

Since the value of `ans` is updated to include `n`, we need to specify that `ans` will now contain one additional element, which is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an ambiguous integer, `ans` contains previous elements plus the current value of `n`, and `ans` now includes the current value of `n`.**
