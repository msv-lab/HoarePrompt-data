In the provided code snippet, `result` is assigned the value of a list that ranges from `left + 1` to `right`. 

1. The variable `left` is calculated as `(5 * m + 5) // 2 - k`.
2. The variable `right` is given as `(5 * m + 5) // 2 + (n + 1)`, where `n` is the number of times the loop executed. 
3. The list created by `range(left + 1, right)` will generate values starting from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.

Since the values of `left` and `right` are derived from the variables `m` and `k`, and `n`, we will maintain the expressions for `left` and `right` without calculating their explicit integer values, as the exact values of `m`, `k`, and `n` are not provided.

The output state is updated to reflect that `result` now contains a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, while retaining all other variables and their expressions.

Output State: **`left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 - `k`; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is a list from `left + 1` to `right - 1`; `right` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2 + (n + 1)**
