To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation:

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find all positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.

### Understanding the Code:
1. **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \). It uses the formula which counts how many multiples of 5 are there, since trailing zeroes are created by pairs of factors of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**: This function tries to find all integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.
   - It uses binary search to find a point where the number of trailing zeroes equals \( m \).
   - Once it finds a mid-point with exactly \( m \) zeroes, it expands left and right to find all such \( n \).

### Key Checks:
- The program correctly handles cases where \( m = 1 \) (returns values 5 to 9) and \( m = 5 \) (returns 0) based on given examples.
- The high bound for searching is set to \( 5 \times (m + 1) \) which seems reasonable, as the number of trailing zeroes in factorial grows with \( n \).

### Edge Cases:
To ensure that this program works correctly for all inputs, we have to consider cases:
- Check for \( m = 0 \): The function does not handle \( m = 0 \) explicitly, and factorials for \( n < 5 \) should return numbers; however, since \( m \) is defined to start from 1, this isn't an issue based on constraints.
- Check for values of \( m \) that do not correspond to any \( n \). The binary search should handle this properly by adjusting the limits.
  
However, the key issue arises when checking for cases where \( m \) is not achievable:
For example, \( m = 2 \) doesn't appear as \( n! \) (1! through 4!) produces 0 or 1 trailing zeroes, but for \( n = 10 \) onward, we can confirm that we find results, and the function seems to find ranges correctly.

### Conclusion:
After careful consideration, I found no case where the program fails based on the specification provided. Therefore, no counter-example exists that disproves correctness.

Correctness: **True**.

The implementation correctly counts the number of trailing zeroes and finds all integers \( n \) that yield exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes, as defined by the problem description.
