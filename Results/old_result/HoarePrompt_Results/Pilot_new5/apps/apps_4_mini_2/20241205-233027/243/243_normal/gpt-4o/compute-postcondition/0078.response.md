According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must remain equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `func_1(right)` must currently equal `m`, and `right` has been incremented by 1.

Since `right` has already been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `func_1(right + 1)` still equals `m` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the condition regarding `right`.

State: **`left` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `func_1(right + 1)` must equal `m`**
