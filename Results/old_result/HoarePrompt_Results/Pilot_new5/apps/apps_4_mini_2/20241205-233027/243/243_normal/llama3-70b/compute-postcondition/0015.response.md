In the provided code, `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1. Since the code does not affect the values of `m` or `n`, those remain unchanged. 

After executing the code:

- The value of `count` increases from 1 to 2.
- The values of `m` and `n` stay within their defined bounds.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `count` is 2, and `n` is 1.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `count` is 2, and `n` is 1.**
