Output State: **`func_1(left) is not equal to m, left is the last value where func_1(left) was equal to m minus 1, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000, zeroes is equal to func_1(mid), mid is equal to (low + high) // 2, result is an empty list, right is increased by 1, and func_1(right) must be equal to m, `right` is now increased by 1.**
