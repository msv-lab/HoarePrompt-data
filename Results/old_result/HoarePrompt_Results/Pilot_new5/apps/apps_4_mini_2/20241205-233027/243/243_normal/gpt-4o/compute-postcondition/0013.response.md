In the initial state, we have `mid` calculated as (5 * `m` + 5) // 2. The assignment `left = mid` means that `left` will take the value of `mid`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is (5 * `m` + 5) // 2.**
