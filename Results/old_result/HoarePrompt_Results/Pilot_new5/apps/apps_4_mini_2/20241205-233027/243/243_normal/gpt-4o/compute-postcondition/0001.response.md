The code assigns values to `low` and `high`. Given that `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\), `high` is calculated as \(5 \times (m + 1)\). Since `low` is assigned to 0, this does not depend on `m`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1)**
