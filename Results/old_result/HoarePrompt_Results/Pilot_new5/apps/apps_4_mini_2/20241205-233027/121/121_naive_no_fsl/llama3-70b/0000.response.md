Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly, especially when the input has more question marks than needed to balance the nucleotides.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
???C??CT
```
In this case, the program will count the existing nucleotides and determine how many of each type are needed to reach the average of 2 for each nucleotide. However, because there are 6 question marks, it's possible to replace them in a way that results in 2 of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T').

The program would keep replacing the '?' until it runs out of available counts, but it does not check if the total number of '?', after redistribution, is actually able to create a valid configuration. If the total number of existing nucleotides plus the number of question marks does not allow for an equal number of each nucleotide, the output should be "===".

Additionally, the program incorrectly assumes that any time the counts of nucleotides are equal by the end of the loop, it is a valid solution regardless of the number of '?'. 

For the input:
```
12
A??C??G??
```
The program may end up replacing '?'s in a way that doesn't balance the nucleotides correctly, leading to a scenario where it outputs a valid string but fails to meet the condition of equal counts.

In summary, the program lacks proper checks for edge cases and fails to confirm that the total nucleotide counts can actually achieve a balanced configuration given the number of '?' characters, leading to incorrect outputs in some scenarios.
