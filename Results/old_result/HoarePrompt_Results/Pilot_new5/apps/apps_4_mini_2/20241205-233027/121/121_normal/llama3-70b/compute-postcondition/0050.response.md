The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` has been updated such that `count[nc]` is decreased by 1, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `c` is the next character in `s`, `nc` is greater than 0, `res` is increased by `nc`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
