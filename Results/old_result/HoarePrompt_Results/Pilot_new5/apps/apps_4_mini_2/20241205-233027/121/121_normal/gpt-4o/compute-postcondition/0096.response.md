The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. Here, `n` is an integer constrained such that \(4 \leq n \leq 255\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. After executing the function body, regardless of the cases that are met, the function returns nothing in all cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s`, but it does not produce any return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer) and `s` (a string of length n), and it does not return any value.**
