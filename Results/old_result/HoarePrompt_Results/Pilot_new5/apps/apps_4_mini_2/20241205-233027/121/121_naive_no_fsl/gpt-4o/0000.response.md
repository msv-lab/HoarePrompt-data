Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails in scenarios where the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' are already close to the `target_count`, but still not equal. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
8
AACCGG??
```
In this case, the `target_count` is 2 (since 8 / 4 = 2). The counts of 'A', 'C', and 'G' are 2, 2, and 2 respectively, while the counts of 'T' is 0. There are two '?' characters available to replace, but the program does not take into account that it must replace both '?' with 'T' in order to achieve balance. Instead, it will replace only one '?' with 'T' and may replace the other '?' with any nucleotide that is already at its target count, leading to an incorrect output.

Thus, the program does not guarantee that the genome can be correctly decoded in all scenarios, leading to the conclusion that it is not completely correct.
