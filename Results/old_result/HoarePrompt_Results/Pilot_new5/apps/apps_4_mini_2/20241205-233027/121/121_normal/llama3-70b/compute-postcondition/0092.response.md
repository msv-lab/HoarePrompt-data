Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, and `count` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}. If at least one value in `count` is greater than 0, then `res` contains the original string `s` with all occurrences of '?' replaced by characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' according to the counts in `count`. If all values in `count` are 0, then `res` is the original string `s` since there are no characters to replace the '?'.***
