Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, and `count` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with non-negative integers. If `c` is equal to '?', the counts in `count` reflect the number of remaining characters for each processed character, indicating how many times each character was added to `res`. If `c` is not equal to '?', then `res` is updated to include the value of `c`.***
