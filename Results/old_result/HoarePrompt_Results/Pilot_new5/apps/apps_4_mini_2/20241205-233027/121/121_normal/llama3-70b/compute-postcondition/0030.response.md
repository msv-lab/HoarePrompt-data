Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is {'A': avg - x - 1, 'C': avg - y, 'G': avg - z, 'T': avg - w}, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is '?', `nc` is 'A', and if `count['A']` is greater than 0, `res` is updated by appending 'A', resulting in `res += 'A'`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
