Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` has been updated with `count[nc]` decreased by 1, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `c` is the next character in `s`, `res` is increased by `nc`, and `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT' that has not been processed. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
