Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with non-negative integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the next character in `s`, and `res` contains characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on the counts in `count`, indicating how many times each character was added to `res`. If `count[nc]` was greater than 0 for each processed character, `count[nc]` reflects the number of remaining characters after processing.**
