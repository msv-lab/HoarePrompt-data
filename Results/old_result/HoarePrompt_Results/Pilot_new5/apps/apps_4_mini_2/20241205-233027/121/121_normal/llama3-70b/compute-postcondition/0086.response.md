Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and `avg` is `n // 4`. If `c` is '?', one character from 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' is included in `res` and its count in `count` is decremented by 1; if all counts are zero, `res` remains unchanged. If `c` is a character in `s` that is not '?', then `res` is updated to include `c`.***
