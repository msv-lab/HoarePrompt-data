The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `result` is a list of length `n` with `result[i]` equal to `char`, `i` is the number of unique characters added to `result`, `counts` has at least 1 element, and `counts[char]` is now equal to its previous value plus 1 (i.e., `counts[char]` + 1 < `target_count`).
