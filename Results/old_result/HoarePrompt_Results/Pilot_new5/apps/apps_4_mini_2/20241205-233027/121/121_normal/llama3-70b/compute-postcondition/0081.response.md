The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `avg` is `n // 4`; `count['A']` is greater than 0 and is now decreased by 1; `nc` is 'A'; `res` is updated by appending 'A' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
