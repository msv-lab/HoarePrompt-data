Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `result` is a list containing the unique characters from `s` up to the number of unique characters added, `i` is equal to the number of unique characters added to `result`, `counts` reflects the state after adding characters with each character count being less than `target_count`. If there are no more characters left to add that meet the condition, `result` may contain `?` for remaining indices.**
