Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 255; `count` is {'A': x, 'C': y, 'G': z, 'T': w}, where x, y, z, and w are the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' characters in the string `s`, respectively. If `s` contains any '?' characters, they do not affect the counts. If `s` contains no characters other than '?', then `count` remains {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}.**
