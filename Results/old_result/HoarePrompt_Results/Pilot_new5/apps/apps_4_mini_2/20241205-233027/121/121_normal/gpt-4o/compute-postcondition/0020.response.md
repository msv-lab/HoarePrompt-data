Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n`, `counts` is a dictionary containing the count of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`, where `counts['A']`, `counts['C']`, `counts['G']`, and `counts['T']` represent the total occurrences of these characters in `s`. If no characters from `s` were in counts, then `counts` remains {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}.**
