The code assigns the values of `n` and `s` by reading input and mapping it to integers. The variables `n` and `s` will now hold the values provided through input, while the list `v` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this code snippet. The previous constraints on `n` and `s` still hold.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input value such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the second input value such that 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n integers where each integer v_i satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9.**
