Postcondition: ***`n` and `s` are positive integers, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers. If `total` is less than `s`, `low` is updated to the previous value of `mid`, while `high` remains greater than the new `low`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`, and `total` is recomputed as the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`.***
