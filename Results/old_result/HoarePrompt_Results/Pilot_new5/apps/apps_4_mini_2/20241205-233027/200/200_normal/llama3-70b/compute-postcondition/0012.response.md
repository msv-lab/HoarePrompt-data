According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will continue as long as `low` is less than `high`.

At the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure that `low` is still less than `high` for the loop to execute again. Given the conditions described in the initial state, if `low` is equal to or greater than `high`, the loop cannot run another iteration.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment should be made to ensure that `low` remains less than `high`. If `low` is currently equal to `high`, we need to reduce `high` by at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `s` is an input positive integer, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`, `low` must be less than `high`**
