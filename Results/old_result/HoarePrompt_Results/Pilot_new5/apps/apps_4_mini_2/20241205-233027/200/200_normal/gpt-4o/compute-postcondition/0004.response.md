Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input value such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the second input value such that 1 <= s <= 10^12; `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers from input where each integer satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9; `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)`. The current value of `total_volume` is less than `s`.***
