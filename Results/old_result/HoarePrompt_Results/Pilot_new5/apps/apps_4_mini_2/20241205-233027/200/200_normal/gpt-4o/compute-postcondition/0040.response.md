Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (1 <= n <= 1000) and `s` (1 <= s <= 10^12), followed by a list of `n` integers (1 <= v_i <= 10^9). It calculates the total volume of the list. If the total volume is less than `s`, it outputs `-1`. If the total volume is sufficient, it determines the minimum possible volume of the smallest keg after allocating kvass from the larger kegs to meet the required `s` and prints that minimum volume. If not enough kvass can be taken from the larger kegs to meet `s`, it adjusts the minimum keg volume accordingly. **
