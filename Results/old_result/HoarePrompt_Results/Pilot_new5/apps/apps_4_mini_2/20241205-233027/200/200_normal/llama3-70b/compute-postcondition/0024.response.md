Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `high` is equal to `min(v)`, and `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v` such that this sum is the last computed total before the loop exited. If the loop has executed at least once, then the original value of `high` was greater than `low` and the final value of `low` is the last `mid` calculated where the sum was less than `s`. If `total` was always greater than or equal to `s`, `high` would have been adjusted downwards accordingly. The loop will terminate with `low` and `high` converging to a single point.**
