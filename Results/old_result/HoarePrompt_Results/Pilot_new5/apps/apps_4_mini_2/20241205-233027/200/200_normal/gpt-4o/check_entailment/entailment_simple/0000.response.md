To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the program step by step.

### Problem Summary:
1. We are given `n` kegs, each holding a certain volume of kvass.
2. We need to pour out `s` liters of kvass.
3. Our goal is to maximize the minimum kvass level in any keg after pouring out `s` liters.
4. If itâ€™s impossible to pour out `s` liters (i.e., if the total volume is less than `s`), we should return `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads `n` and `s` and the volumes of the kegs.

2. **Total Volume Check:**
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of all kegs (`total_volume`) is less than `s`. If true, it prints `-1`, which aligns with the problem description.

3. **Min Keg Volume Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `min_keg_volume` with the smallest keg volume after sorting the volumes.
   - It then iterates through the volumes to distribute the kvass to pour out `s` liters.

4. **Pouring Logic:**
   - The `for` loop iterates through the sorted volumes and calculates how much kvass can be taken from each keg while aiming to keep the minimum keg level as high as possible.
   - The program reduces the `remaining_kvass` by the amount taken from the kegs and stops when the `remaining_kvass` reaches `0`.
   - If there is any `remaining_kvass` left after this process, it reduces the `min_keg_volume` accordingly by distributing the excess kvass evenly among all kegs.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints `min_keg_volume`, which is intended to reflect the maximum minimum volume left in the kegs after pouring.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program successfully checks if pouring `s` liters is possible and calculates how much kvass can remain in the least full keg afterward.
- The logic for distributing kvass is handled correctly and efficiently.
- The potential edge cases are covered, such as when the total volume is less than `s` and when there is surplus kvass after the pour.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly handles all specified cases, including edge cases where the pouring is impossible or where the kvass levels can be maximized in the least keg.

Thus, the final determination is:

Correctness: **True**
