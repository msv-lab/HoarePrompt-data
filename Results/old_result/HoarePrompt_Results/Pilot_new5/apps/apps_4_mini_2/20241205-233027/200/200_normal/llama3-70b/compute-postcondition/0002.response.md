The array `v` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The values of `n`, `s`, and the original contents of `v` are preserved, but the order of the elements in `v` is now changed. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is an input positive integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `v` is a sorted list of n positive integers (1 <= v[i] <= 10^9).**
