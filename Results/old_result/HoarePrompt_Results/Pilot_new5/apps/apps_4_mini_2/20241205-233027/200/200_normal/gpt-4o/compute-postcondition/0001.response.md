In this case, `volumes` is assigned the value of a list created from the input which consists of `n` integers, each of which is converted from the input string to an integer. The previous values of `n` and `v` remain valid, but `v` will now be replaced by `volumes` which holds the list of integers inputted by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input value such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the second input value such that 1 <= s <= 10^12; `volumes` is a list of `n` integers from input where each integer satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9.**
