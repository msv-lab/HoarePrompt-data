Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, and `high` is equal to `min(v)`. If the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v` is not equal to `s`, then the current value of `low` is the last `mid` calculated where the sum was less than `s`, and `-1` is printed. Otherwise, if the sum equals `s`, then the output is `low`. The loop will terminate with `low` and `high` converging to a single point.***
