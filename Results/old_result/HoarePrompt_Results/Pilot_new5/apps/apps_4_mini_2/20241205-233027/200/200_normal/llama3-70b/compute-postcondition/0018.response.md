According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. For the loop to execute again, `low` must be less than `high`. At the end of the last iteration, there is a postcondition that states `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, and `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers. 

Since the postcondition does not provide specific values for `low` and `high`, we only know that both variables exist, and their relationship must satisfy `low < high` for the loop to execute again. However, we do not know their current values from the provided information.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we can conclude that `high` must be greater than `low`. Therefore, we need to state that `high` must be greater than `low`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `v` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, and `high` must be greater than `low`**
