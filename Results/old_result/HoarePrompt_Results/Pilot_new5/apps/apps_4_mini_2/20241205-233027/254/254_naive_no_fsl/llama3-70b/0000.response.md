Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains logical errors that cause it to fail to correctly determine whether it is possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit during every second after the maximum of those moments. 

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of LCM**: The program attempts to compute the least common multiple (LCM) using a formula that is not standard. The LCM should be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
   \]
   The code seems to attempt to calculate the LCM of three numbers in a convoluted way which is flawed. It combines the LCMs incorrectly.

2. **Logic Flaw in the Condition**: The check `if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0)` will not correctly ensure that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of the times chosen. This condition merely checks divisibility which does not guarantee coverage of all time intervals.

### Counterexample:
- For input `1 2 3`, the function would incorrectly compute the LCM and yield `YES` based on its flawed logic. In reality, it is possible to select `x1=1`, `x2=1`, `x3=1` leading to coverage of all seconds.
- But for input `4 2 3`, the program would output `NO`, which is incorrect. It can be observed that if selected appropriately, the garlands can still light all seconds.

Given the above points, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem statement completely, thus making it incorrect.
