The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing time intervals of garlands, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500. The function computes and returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the original values of `a` and `b`, given that `b` is zero. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, both integers representing time intervals, and returns the GCD of a and b, where b is zero.**
