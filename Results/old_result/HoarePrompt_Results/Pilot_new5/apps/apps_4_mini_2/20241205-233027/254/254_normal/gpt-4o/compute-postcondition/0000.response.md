`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are assigned the values obtained from the input, where `input` provides three integers separated by spaces, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous values of `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are unknown, but they must satisfy the constraint `1 ≤ k_i ≤ 1500`. After execution, the output state will reflect the new values assigned to `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, which are based on the input. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers assigned from input values, satisfying 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500**.
