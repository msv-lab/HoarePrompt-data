The code simply prints 'NO' and does not alter any variables or states. Therefore, the values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `gcd_k1_k2`, and `gcd_all` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`; `gcd_all` is equal to `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3); gcd_all` is greater than 1.**
