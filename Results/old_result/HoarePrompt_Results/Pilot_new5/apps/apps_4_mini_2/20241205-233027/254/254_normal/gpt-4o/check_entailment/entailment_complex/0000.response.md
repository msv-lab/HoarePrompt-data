Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately solve the problem as described. The key issue lies in the condition it checks.

In the problem description, it is stated that Mishka wants to ensure that at least one garland is lit during each second after the maximum of the chosen moments \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(x_3\). The program's approach of checking whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) is 1 is not sufficient to guarantee the required coverage.

To illustrate why this logic is flawed, consider the input examples provided:

1. For the input `2 2 3`, the GCD is 1, and the program correctly outputs "YES". This means it's possible to configure the garlands to cover every second.
  
2. However, for the input `4 2 3`, the GCD is 1 as well, which leads the program to output "YES". But upon closer inspection, there will be intervals where no garland lights the tree after switching on. Specifically, if you start the first garland at time 1, the second at time 2, and the third at time 1, there will be seconds after a certain point (when time is a multiple of 4) where no garland will be lit because the 4th second is not covered by any garland, thus failing to satisfy the problem's requirement.

The failure lies in the fact that the GCD condition does not adequately ensure coverage of all seconds in terms of the intervals provided. Therefore, the approach taken by the program does not consistently meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.
