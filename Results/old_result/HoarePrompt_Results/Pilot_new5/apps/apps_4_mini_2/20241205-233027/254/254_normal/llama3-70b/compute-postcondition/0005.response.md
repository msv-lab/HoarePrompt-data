The code snippet assigns the values of `b` and `a % b` to `a` and `b`, respectively. Given that `b` is the previous value of `a`, by the assignment, `a` will become the remainder of the division of the previous value of `a` by `b`. Since `b` must be greater than 0 and `a` cannot be 0, `a` will take a value between 0 and `b-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

The final impact is:
- `a` is now `b % a` (where `b` was the previous value of `a`).
- `b` is now the previous value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is now `b % a`, `b` is the previous value of `a`, `b` must be greater than 0, and `a` must not be equal to 0**.
