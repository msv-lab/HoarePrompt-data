The value of `gcd_k1_k2` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, calculated using `math.gcd()`. The initial values of `k1` and `k2` are integers satisfying the condition 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2` ≤ 1500. The value of `gcd_k1_k2` will be an integer that is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, which is also within the range of possible values for integers, specifically between 1 and the minimum of `k1` and `k2`.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`.**
