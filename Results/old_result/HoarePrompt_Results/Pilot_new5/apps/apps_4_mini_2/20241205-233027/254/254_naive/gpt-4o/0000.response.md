Correctness: **False**.

The program incorrectly determines if there exists a time at which at least one garland is lit after the maximum of the start times \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). The condition checking `gcd_all == 1` is not sufficient to guarantee that there will be at least one garland lit at all times after the maximum start time. 

For example, if \( k_1 = 2 \), \( k_2 = 2 \), and \( k_3 = 2 \), the program would return "YES" because the GCD is 2, but there are gaps in the timing where no garlands are lit if all start at the same time. 

Similarly, if \( k_1 = 4 \), \( k_2 = 2 \), and \( k_3 = 3 \), the program returns "NO" because the GCD is 1, yet by starting garlands at \( x_1 = 0 \), \( x_2 = 0 \), and \( x_3 = 1 \), there would be gaps where no garlands are lit. 

Thus, this logic does not cover all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect outputs in situations where the GCD condition alone is not a valid check.
