To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code closely.

**Problem Description Summary:**
Mishka wants to ensure that all seconds after switching on the garlands have at least one garland lit. The intervals for each garland's lighting are given by integers \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \). We need to determine if it's possible to choose times \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) such that at least one garland is lit at every second from \( \max(x_1, x_2, x_3) \).

**Program Analysis:**
The program computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) using the function `func_1`, which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD). The LCM is calculated as follows:
```python
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
```
This part has a flaw. The LCM should be calculated using a proper formula, which is:
\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
\]
The provided formula is incorrect because it uses the product of GCDs instead of a single GCD for each pair.

After calculating the LCM, the program checks if each \( k_i \) divides the LCM:
```python
if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
```
This check will not necessarily ensure that there are no gaps in the lighting of the garlands.

**Counterexample:**
Let's consider the inputs \( k_1 = 2 \), \( k_2 = 3 \), and \( k_3 = 4 \). The expected output is 'YES' because one can choose times such that all seconds are covered:
- Choose \( x_1 = 0 \) for the first garland (lit at 0, 2, 4, ...)
- Choose \( x_2 = 1 \) for the second garland (lit at 1, 4, 7, ...)
- Choose \( x_3 = 0 \) for the third garland (lit at 0, 4, 8, ...)

However, using the program's logic, it will incorrectly compute the LCM and check divisibility in a way that does not accurately reflect the conditions of the problem.

Thus, the program incorrectly verifies whether it is possible to ensure that every second after the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) is covered by at least one garland.

**Final Decision:**
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly due to its flawed calculation and logic for ensuring garlands light up every second after the chosen times.
