#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are integers representing the time intervals of the three garlands, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, `c` is an integer
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, representing time intervals. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function does not check for the validity of the input parameters beyond being integers; thus, it will handle cases where either `a` or `b` is zero, returning the absolute value of the non-zero parameter or zero if both are zero.
