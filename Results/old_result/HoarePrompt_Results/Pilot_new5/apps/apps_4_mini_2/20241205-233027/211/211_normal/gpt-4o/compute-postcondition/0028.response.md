The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
