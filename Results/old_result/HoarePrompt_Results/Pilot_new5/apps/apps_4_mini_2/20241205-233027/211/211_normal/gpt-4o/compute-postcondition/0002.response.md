The value of `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the integers in the list `A`. The variable `n` remains an input positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `A` is a list containing `n` integers, each of which lies between -1000 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`.**
