To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it fulfills the requirements stated in the problem.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to check if we can split the array into parts such that the sum of each part is not zero.
- If the entire sum of the array is zero, we should print "NO".
- Otherwise, we print "YES", the number of parts, and the indices of each part.

### Given Program Analysis
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)
```

### Potential Cases
1. **Case with a sum of zero but parts can be split:** Consider the array `[1, 2, -3]`. The total sum is `0`, but we can split it into `[1, 2]` and `[-3]`. The given logic correctly identifies that the total sum is zero and prints "NO".

2. **Single element zero case:** When the input is `1` and the array is `[0]`, it correctly results in "NO".

3. **Case with multiple zeros:** Input like `5` and the array `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` should also yield "NO" since the sum is zero and there are no valid parts.

4. **Case with non-zero sum:** The program should correctly identify valid partitions. However, the logic regarding how it prints the indices might be incorrect because:
   - The program prints parts only if the prefix sums are not zero, which could lead to incorrect index output.

### Incorrect Index Printing
An example to illustrate the potential flaw:
- Input: `3` and array `[-1, 1, 0]`. The program would compute the prefix sums as `[-1, 0, 0, 0]`. Here, it should ideally split between the first two elements, but since the last prefix sum is zero, it does not print correctly.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases because it may fail to produce the correct parts when the sums are zero in intermediate steps. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

This is because there are inputs where it doesn't output valid subarrays correctly based on the conditions given.
