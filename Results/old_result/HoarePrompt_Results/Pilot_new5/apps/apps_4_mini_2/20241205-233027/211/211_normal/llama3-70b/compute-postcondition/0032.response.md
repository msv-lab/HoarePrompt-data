Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` in [1, `n`] is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, while `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` > `n` remains 0; `k` is the count of valid `r` values where `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` holds the last valid `r` value that satisfied the condition, `r` will be equal to `n + 1` after the loop finishes.**
