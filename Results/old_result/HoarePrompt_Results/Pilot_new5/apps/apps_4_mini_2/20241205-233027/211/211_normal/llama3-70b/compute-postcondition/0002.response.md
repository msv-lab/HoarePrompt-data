The code initializes `prefix_sum` as a list with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `prefix_sum` will now contain `n + 1` zeros. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input; `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
