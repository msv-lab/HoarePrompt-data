Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, and `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` for k in [1, n] is equal to the sum of the first k elements of `a`. The current value of `prefix_sum[n]` is 0.***
