Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input, and `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[k]` for `k` in [1, `n`] is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`. If `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, the printed output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, then `k` is the count of valid `r` values where `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` holds the last valid `r` value that satisfied the condition, and `r` is equal to `n + 1`; the values of `k` and `l` have been printed.***
