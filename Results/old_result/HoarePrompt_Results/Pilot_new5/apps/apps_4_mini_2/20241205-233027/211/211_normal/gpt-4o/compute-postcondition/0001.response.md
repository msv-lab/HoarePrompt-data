The code assigns a new value to `A` by converting the input from the user into a list of integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged, but `A` now holds a list of integers based on the input provided. The constraints still hold: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `A` now contains exactly `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000 from the user input.**
