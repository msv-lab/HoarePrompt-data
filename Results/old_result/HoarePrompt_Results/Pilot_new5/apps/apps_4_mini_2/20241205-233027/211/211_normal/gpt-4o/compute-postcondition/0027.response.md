The statement `print(i + 2, n)` outputs the result of `i + 2` and the value of `n`. The variable `i` has a value of 2, so `i + 2` equals 4. The variable `n` is greater than 2, but its specific value is not given; however, it remains greater than 2 after execution. The other variables (`total_sum` and `A`) are unaffected. 

Output State: **`total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, 'YES' is printed, '2' is printed, '1 3' is printed, and 4 is printed along with the value of `n`.**
