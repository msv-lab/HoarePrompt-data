The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, and '2' is printed, output is '3 n' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
