The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string '1' followed by the result of the expression `i + 1`. Since `i` is initially 1, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to `2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, and '2' is printed, and the output of the print statement is '1 2'.

Output State: **`total_sum` is 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers that sum to 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, and '2' is printed, output is '1 2'**.
