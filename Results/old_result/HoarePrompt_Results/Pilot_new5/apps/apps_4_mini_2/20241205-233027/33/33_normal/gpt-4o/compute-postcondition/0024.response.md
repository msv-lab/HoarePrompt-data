Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50. If `dir` is 'North', then `position` is a negative value equal to `0 - t`, and `valid` is set to False. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is set to `t` and `valid` is set to False. For any other value of `dir`, `position` can either be 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False if `dir` is 'West' or 'East', while `t` remains as an input integer and `dir` is a string not equal to 'North' or 'South'.***
