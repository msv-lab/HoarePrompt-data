To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic step by step.

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the North Pole. This aligns with the condition that Limak starts at the North Pole.

2. **Input Handling**: It reads `n`, the number of movements, and then processes each movement by reading `t` (the distance) and `dir` (the direction).

3. **Direction Checks**: 
   - When the direction is "North", it increases `curr_lat` by the distance converted to degrees (using the conversion factor 111.195 for kilometers to degrees). 
   - When the direction is "South", it decreases `curr_lat` in a similar manner.
   - For directions "West" and "East", the program uses `continue`, which means it does not modify `curr_lat` for those directions. This is correct since moving West or East does not affect the latitude.

4. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - It checks if `curr_lat` goes below -90 or above 90 after any move, which is necessary to ensure Limak doesn't move beyond the poles.
   - If `curr_lat` reaches -90 (the South Pole), it checks if the next direction is "North". If not, it prints 'NO' and exits.
   - If `curr_lat` is 90 (the North Pole), it checks if the next direction is "South". If not, it also prints 'NO' and exits.

5. **Final Check**: After processing all movements, it checks if `curr_lat` is still 90 (North Pole). If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Validation Against Problem Description
- **Starting at the North Pole**: The program correctly starts at the North Pole (90 degrees).
- **Moving Only South from the North Pole**: The program enforces that if `curr_lat` is 90, the next move must be South.
- **Moving Only North from the South Pole**: The program ensures if `curr_lat` is -90, the next move must be North.
- **Ending at the North Pole**: The program checks that `curr_lat` equals 90 at the end of the movements.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements all specified conditions from the problem description. It handles input processing, direction changes, and boundary conditions properly, ensuring that Limak follows the rules defined.

Correctness: **True**
