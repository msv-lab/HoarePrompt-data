The `exit()` command is used to terminate the program immediately. Therefore, no changes are made to the existing variables, and the program execution halts without modifying any state or returning any values. The previous conditions remain valid, and the program exits after printing 'NO'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is an integer; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; the program execution exits after printing 'NO'.**
