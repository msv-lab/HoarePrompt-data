The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on input conditions that specify the following constraints: 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
- For each of the `n` parts, `t_i` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t_i <= 10^6.
- `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", or "East".

The output of the function is not provided in the information given. Therefore, I cannot specify the return values or any conditions based on the provided input parameters.

However, based on what has been established, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates based on specific input conditions regarding the number of parts and their respective properties. The return value is unspecified and depends on the processing of these conditions.**
