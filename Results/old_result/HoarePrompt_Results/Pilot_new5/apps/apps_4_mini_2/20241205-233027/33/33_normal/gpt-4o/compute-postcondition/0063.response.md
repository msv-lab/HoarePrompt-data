Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50; `position` is a value between 1 and 20000; `valid` is False; `t` is the last integer input received; `dir` is the last directional input received; if `position` is not 0, it indicates that some movements occurred leading to the current value of `position`, and `valid` reflects whether all these movements were valid. If the loop does not execute, `position` remains 0 and `valid` is True.***
