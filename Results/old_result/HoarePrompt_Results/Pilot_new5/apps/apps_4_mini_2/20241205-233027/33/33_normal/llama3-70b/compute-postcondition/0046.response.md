The variable `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its previous value. The condition states that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2, but `n` does not directly affect the calculation. The variable `t` is an integer which is divided by 111.195 to update `curr_lat`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is an integer; `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its previous value.**
