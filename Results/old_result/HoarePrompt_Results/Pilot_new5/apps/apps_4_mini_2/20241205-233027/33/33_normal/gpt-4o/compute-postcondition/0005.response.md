The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the input string `t` into an integer. The values of `n`, `position`, and `valid` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `t` as an integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `position` is 0, `valid` is True, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string**
