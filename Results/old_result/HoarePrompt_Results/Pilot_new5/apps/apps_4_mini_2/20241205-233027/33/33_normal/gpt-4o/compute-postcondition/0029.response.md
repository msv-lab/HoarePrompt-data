The values of `t` and `dir` are assigned from the input received and split into two separate values. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and the current iteration count is less than `n`, which will be `n - 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the current iteration count is less than `n` (so it will be `n - 1`), `t` is an input string, and `dir` is an input string.**
