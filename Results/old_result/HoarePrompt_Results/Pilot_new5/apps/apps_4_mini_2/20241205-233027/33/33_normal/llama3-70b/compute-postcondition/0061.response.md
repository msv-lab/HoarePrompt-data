The code checks if `curr_lat` is equal to 90. If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The value of `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, but the specific value at this point is unknown based on the provided initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90; `t` is an integer representing the last valid input value converted from the input; if `curr_lat` reaches -90, the last direction must be 'North'; if `curr_lat` reaches 90, the last direction must be 'South'; output is 'YES' if `curr_lat` equals 90, otherwise 'NO'.**
