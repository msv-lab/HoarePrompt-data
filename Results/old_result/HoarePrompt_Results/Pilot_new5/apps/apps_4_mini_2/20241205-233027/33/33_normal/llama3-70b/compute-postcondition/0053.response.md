Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is an integer. If `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, then `curr_lat` remains unchanged and the program has exited, rendering 'NO' irrelevant. If `curr_lat` is within the valid range, the updates to `curr_lat` based on the direction ('North' or 'South') are not executed.***
