The value of `t` is converted from a string to an integer. Since `t` is originally a string, its specific value is now not known but it will be transformed to an integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the current iteration count is less than `n`, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is the input string for dir.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50; the current iteration count is less than `n`; `t` is an integer; `dir` is the input string for dir.**
