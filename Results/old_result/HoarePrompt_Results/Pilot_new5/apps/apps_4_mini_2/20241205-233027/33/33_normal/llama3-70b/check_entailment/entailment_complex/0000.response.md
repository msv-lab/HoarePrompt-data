Correctness: **False**

The program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the requirements outlined in the problem description:

1. **Latitude Calculation**: The program uses a conversion factor (111.195) to adjust the latitude based on the distance input in kilometers, which is not correct in the context of this problem. The problem states that moving from the North Pole to the South Pole takes exactly 20,000 kilometers, which means that moving 1 kilometer should adjust the latitude by 1/20,000 of the way from 90 degrees to -90 degrees, not 1/111.195 of the way.

2. **Valid Direction Check at the Poles**: The program correctly checks that if Limak is at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude), he can only move South, and if he is at the South Pole (-90 degrees latitude), he can only move North. However, due to the incorrect latitude calculation, the program may erroneously allow movements that should not be valid.

3. **Ending Condition**: The program checks if the final latitude is 90 degrees to determine if Limak ends at the North Pole, which is the desired condition. However, this check could be misled by incorrect latitude values due to the earlier calculations.

4. **Handling East and West Directions**: The program ignores movements in the East and West directions without any constraints or warnings. However, the problem statement does not allow movements in these directions to be valid if Limak is not at the poles; this could potentially lead to invalid states since those directions do not contribute to latitude changes.

In summary, the program fails to accurately map distances to latitude changes and does not handle the constraints properly for East and West movements. Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem requirements as intended.
