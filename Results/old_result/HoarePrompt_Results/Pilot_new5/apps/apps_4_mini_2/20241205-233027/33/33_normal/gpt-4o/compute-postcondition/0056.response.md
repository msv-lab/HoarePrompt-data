Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the current iteration count is less than `n`, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is an input string. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position + t`, and if `position` exceeds 20000, then `valid` is set to False. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East' and `position` is 0 or 20000, then `valid` is set to False; otherwise, the state of `valid` remains unchanged.***
