The variable `t` is assigned the value `int(t)`, which converts the input value of `t` into an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and must be greater than 1, while `t` and `dir` are based on user input. The value of `t` will now be an integer based on the input. The state of `n` and `dir` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and must be greater than 1; `t` is an integer value converted from input; `dir` is an input value.**
