Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the current iteration count is less than `n`, and `t` is an integer. If `dir` is 'North', then `position` is updated to `position - t`, and if `position - t` is less than 0, `valid` is set to False. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is updated to `position + t`. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East' and `position` is 0 or 20000, then `valid` is set to False. If none of these conditions apply, the state remains as described.***
