The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the current value of `t` from its original type to an integer. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, as does the value of `dir`. However, since `t` is now an integer, we can assert its type.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is an integer; `dir` is the second part of input.**
