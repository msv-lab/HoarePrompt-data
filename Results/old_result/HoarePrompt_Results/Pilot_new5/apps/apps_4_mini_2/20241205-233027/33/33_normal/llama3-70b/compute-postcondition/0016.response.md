The code `exit()` is called, which causes the program to terminate immediately. No variable values are changed, but the execution of the program halts. Therefore, the output reflects the current state of the variables that are still relevant after the program has been terminated. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South'; `curr_lat` remains 90; the program has exited.**
