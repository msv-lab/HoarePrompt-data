Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2, and `t` is an integer. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its previous value. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
