The code `continue` does not change any variable values but instructs the program to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same, and there is no change in their states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and must be greater than 1; `t` is an integer value converted from input; `dir` is an input value; we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
