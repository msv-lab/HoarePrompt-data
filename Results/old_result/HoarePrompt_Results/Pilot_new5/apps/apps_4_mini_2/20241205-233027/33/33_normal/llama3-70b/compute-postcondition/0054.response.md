The code executes a print statement which outputs 'NO'. However, it does not change any of the variable states, nor does it affect the conditions of the variables. `curr_lat` remains unchanged as the program has exited and the other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is an integer; `curr_lat` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 2; `t` is an integer; `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
