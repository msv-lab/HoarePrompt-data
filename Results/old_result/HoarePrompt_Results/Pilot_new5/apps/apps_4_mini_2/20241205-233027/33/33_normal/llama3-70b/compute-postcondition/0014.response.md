Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `90 - t / 111.195`. Otherwise, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `curr_lat` remains 90. The current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90.***
