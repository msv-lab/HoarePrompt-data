The value of `curr_lat` is updated by subtracting `t / 111.195` from its current value (which is 90). The variable `t` is an input integer which can vary. Therefore, the new value of `curr_lat` will be `90 - t / 111.195`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is equal to `90 - t / 111.195`, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is not equal to 'North', and the current value of `dir` is 'South'.**
