In the provided code, `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the difference between `i` and `prev_pos`. The previous state indicates that `max_jump` is 1, `i` is 1, and `prev_pos` is 0. Thus, we can calculate `i - prev_pos` which equals `1 - 0 = 1`. 

Now we determine the new value of `max_jump`:
- The current value of `max_jump` is 1.
- The calculated value of `i - prev_pos` is also 1.

Therefore, `max_jump` remains the same because `max(1, 1)` is 1.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0, `i` is 1**
