Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `last_vowel` is updated to 1 if `s[2]` is a vowel; if `last_vowel` was -1, `max_jump` is updated to max(`max_jump`, 3). If `last_vowel` is not -1, then `last_vowel` remains unchanged and `max_jump` is updated accordingly based on the value of `last_vowel`.***
