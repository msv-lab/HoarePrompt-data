Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to correctly handle the edge case where there are no vowels in the input string. According to the problem description, the Grasshopper should only jump on vowels, and if there are none, he cannot reach the end of the string, which would imply an infinite jump ability is required. 

For example, consider the input string "BCDFGHJKLM". The program would output `11` because it calculates the distance between the start (position `0`) and the end of the string (position `10`), but this is incorrect as the Grasshopper cannot jump anywhere since there are no vowels present.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this case, demonstrating that the logic is incomplete and the output is not consistent with the problem description.
