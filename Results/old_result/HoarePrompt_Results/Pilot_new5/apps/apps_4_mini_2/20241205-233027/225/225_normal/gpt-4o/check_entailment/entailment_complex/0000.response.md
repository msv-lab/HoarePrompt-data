Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s how it achieves this:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a non-empty string of capital English letters, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Identifying Vowels**: It correctly identifies the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y', which is consistent with the problem statement.

3. **Calculating Jump Ability**:
   - The program initializes `max_jump` to 1, which ensures that if there are no vowels, the minimum jump ability is still at least 1 (to reach the end of the string).
   - It iterates through the string to find the positions of vowels. For each vowel found, it calculates the distance (or jump) from the last found vowel to the current one and updates `max_jump` accordingly.
   - After the loop, it checks the distance from the last vowel found to the end of the string, ensuring that all necessary jumps are accounted for.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum jump distance, which corresponds to the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string while only landing on vowels.

The program has considered all necessary cases:
- It computes the jump distances between all vowel positions.
- It also considers the jump required from the last vowel to the end of the string.
- The final result represents the maximum jump (i.e., the minimum jump ability required) accurately as per the problem description.

Thus, the function correctly implements the solution as required by the problem description and successfully calculates the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper.
