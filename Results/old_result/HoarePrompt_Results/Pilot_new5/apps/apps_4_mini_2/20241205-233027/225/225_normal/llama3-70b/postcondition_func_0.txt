The function accepts a non-empty string of capital English letters with a maximum length of 100, calculates the maximum "jump distance" between consecutive vowels, and prints this value. If there are no vowels in the string, it will return a maximum jump distance of 0. Additionally, if the last character of the string is not a vowel, it considers the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string when calculating the maximum jump.
