The variable `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i + 1`. Since `i` is equal to 1, `i + 1` equals 2. The value of `max_jump` will now be the larger of its previous value and 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 0 if `s[1]` is a vowel; otherwise, `last_vowel` remains -1, and `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 2.
