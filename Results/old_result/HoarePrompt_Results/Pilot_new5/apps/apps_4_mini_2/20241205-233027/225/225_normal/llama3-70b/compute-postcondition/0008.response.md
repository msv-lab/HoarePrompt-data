The code assigns `max_jump` the maximum value between its current value and `i + 1`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The previous value of `max_jump` was 0. Therefore, the new value of `max_jump` will become the maximum of 0 and 1, which is 1. 

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is -1, the character at index `i` of `s` is a vowel, and the current value of `last_vowel` is -1.**
