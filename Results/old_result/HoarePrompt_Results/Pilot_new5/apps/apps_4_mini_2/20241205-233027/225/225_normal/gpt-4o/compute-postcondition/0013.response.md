To determine the output state, we first analyze the impact of the code provided given the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters 
- `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'} 
- `max_jump` is 1 
- `prev_pos` is updated to 1 
- `i` is 2 if the character at position `i` in string `s` is a vowel 
- `len(s)` must be at least 3

In the code:
```
max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
```

Here, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of the expression `i - prev_pos`. We know that:
- The current value of `max_jump` is 1.
- `prev_pos` is 1.
- `i` is 2 if the character at position `i` (which is `s[2]`) is a vowel.

Calculating `i - prev_pos` gives us:
- If `i` is 2 (since the initial condition states it is if `s[2]` is a vowel), then `i - prev_pos` = 2 - 1 = 1.

Now, we find `max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)`:
- `max(1, 1)` = 1.

Thus, `max_jump` remains 1 after the assignment.

Since no other variables are changed or affected by this code, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the variables along with the final value of `max_jump`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 1, `i` is 2 if `s[2]` is a vowel, and `len(s)` must be at least 3.**
