Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `c` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers derived from the input provided, `dp[0]` is 0, and `dp[1]` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `costs[1]` if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`. If `vol` is greater than `i`, there are no changes to the program state.***
