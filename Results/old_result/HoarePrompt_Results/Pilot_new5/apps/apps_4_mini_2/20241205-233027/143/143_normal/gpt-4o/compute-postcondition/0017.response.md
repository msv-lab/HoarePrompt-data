The variable `answer` is assigned the value of `max_cost`. The values of `dp[i]` for `i` in the range 0 to 30 are not directly affected by this assignment, and the previous values of `dp[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains valid for the other variables as described.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to n-1; for `i` in range n to 30, `dp[i]` is updated based on previous values: `dp[i]` is `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`; `i` is 31 (loop completes); `answer` is equal to `max_cost`.**
