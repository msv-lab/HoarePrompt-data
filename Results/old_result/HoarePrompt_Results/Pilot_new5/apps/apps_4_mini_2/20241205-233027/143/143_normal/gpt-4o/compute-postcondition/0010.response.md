According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range specified (from 1 to 31) is valid. The variable `i` will take on values from 1 to 30 sequentially. The state of `dp[i]` is already defined for all `i` in the range 0 to 30, which means it has values that can be used in the loop body.

However, if we want to clarify the states before the loop begins, we need to note that `i` starts at 1 and that `dp` must be properly set up for all values of `i` in the range of 1 to 30. 

Thus, the initial state can be modified to reflect the first iteration of the loop:

State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to n-1, `dp[i]` is 10 for `i` in range n to 30, `i` is 1**
