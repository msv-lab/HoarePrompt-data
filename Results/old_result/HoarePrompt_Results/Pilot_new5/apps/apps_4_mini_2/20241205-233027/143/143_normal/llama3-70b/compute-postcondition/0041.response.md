The variable `vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is initially 1, we can calculate `vol`:

1. Calculate `2 ** j`: This results in `2 ** 1`, which is `2`.
2. Subtract `1` from the result: `2 - 1` equals `1`.

Now, `vol` is updated to `1`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The output state must reflect the new value of `vol` while maintaining the existing information about the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `j` is 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `vol` is 1**
