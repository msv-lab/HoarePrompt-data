The variable `max_cost` is assigned the value `10 ** 18`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The assignment of `max_cost` does not affect the values of `n`, `L`, or `costs`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10 ** 18**.
