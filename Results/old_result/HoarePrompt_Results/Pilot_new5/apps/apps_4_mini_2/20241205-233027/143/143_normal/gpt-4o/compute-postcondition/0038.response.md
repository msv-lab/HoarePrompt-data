The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (ranging from 1 to 30 inclusive), a positive integer `L` (ranging from 1 to 10^9 inclusive), and a list `costs` containing `n` integers (where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). The function calculates the minimum accumulated cost based on the provided costs and the value of `L`. 

It first initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` to track the minimum costs and populates it with the minimum of the initial costs and derived values based on previous entries. The function then iterates in reverse from 30 down to 0, updating the total accumulated cost and adjusting based on whether `L` allows for purchasing items represented by the powers of two. 

The final output is the minimum cost calculated in the `answer` variable. Importantly, if `L` does not allow for sufficient purchases to utilize the costs effectively, the function may return a high cost (up to `10^18`), which indicates that the conditions for obtaining the costs were not met.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list `costs`, and returns the minimum accumulated cost based on the specified conditions, considering the constraints of `L` and the provided costs. If `L` is insufficient to leverage the costs, the function may return a high value indicating this limitation. **
