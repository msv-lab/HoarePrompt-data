To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step.

**Initial State:**
- `dp[0] = min(10, costs[0])`
- `dp[1] = min(10, costs[1])`
- `dp[2] = min(min(10, costs[2]), min(10, costs[1]) * 2)`
- `dp[3]` is yet to be updated.
- `dp[i] = 10` for `i` in range `4` to `30`
- `i = 3`

**Code:**
```
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
```

**Impact of the Code:**
1. The value of `i` is currently `3`.
2. `dp[i]` refers to `dp[3]`.
3. The code updates `dp[3]` to be the minimum of its current value `dp[3]` and `dp[2] * 2`.
4. `dp[2]` has already been computed as `min(min(10, costs[2]), min(10, costs[1]) * 2)`.
5. Therefore, we need to evaluate `dp[3]` based on its initial value (which is `10`, from the range assignment for indices `4` to `30`) and the calculated `dp[2]`.

**Calculations:**
- `dp[2]` is computed but we do not have the specific value of `costs`. However, we know it is at most `10` due to the use of `min()`.
- Since `dp[3]` is initially `10`, we can compute `dp[3]` as:
  ```
  dp[3] = min(dp[3], dp[2] * 2) 
  dp[3] = min(10, dp[2] * 2)
  ```
- The value of `dp[2]` could also theoretically be a maximum of `10`, as `dp` values are maintained within `10`.

As a result, without knowing the actual values in `costs`, we can only express the output state in terms of the relationships established.

**Output State:**
- `dp[0] = min(10, costs[0])`
- `dp[1] = min(10, costs[1])`
- `dp[2] = min(min(10, costs[2]), min(10, costs[1]) * 2)`
- `dp[3] = min(10, dp[2] * 2)` (resulting value will depend on `costs`)
- `dp[i] = 10` for `i` in range `4` to `30`
- `i = 3`

Output State: **`dp[0] = min(10, costs[0]), dp[1] = min(10, costs[1]), dp[2] = min(min(10, costs[2]), min(10, costs[1]) * 2), dp[3] = min(10, dp[2] * 2), dp[i] = 10 for i in range 4 to 30, i = 3`**
