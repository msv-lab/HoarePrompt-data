The code updates `dp[i]` to the minimum value between `dp[i]` and `c[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `dp[1]` is being updated. The previous states indicate that `n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is 1, and `dp[0]` has been updated to `min(dp[0], c[0])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is 1, `dp[0]` is updated to min(dp[0], c[0]), `dp[1]` is updated to min(dp[1], c[1])**
