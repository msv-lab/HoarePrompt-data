Postcondition: ***`dp[i]` is equal to `min(10, costs[i])` for `i` in range 0 to 29; `i` is 29; if `L` is greater than or equal to `2^29`, the `current_cost` is updated to the previous `current_cost` plus `dp[29]`, and `L` is decreased by `2^29`. The `answer` remains the minimum of `max_cost` and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`.***
