Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 30) and `L` (between 1 and 10^9), along with a list of `n` integers representing costs. It calculates the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `L` using available volumes defined by the formula `2^j - 1` for `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. If it is not possible to achieve the desired volume, the function returns -1. **
