According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is between 1 and 30. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is updated to min(dp[0], c[0]), `dp[1]` is updated to min(dp[1], c[1])**
