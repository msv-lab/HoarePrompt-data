The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the string `s`. The value of `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 500000, given that the length of `s` is defined to be between 1 and 500000. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of characters from the set {lowercase Latin letters, [, ], :, |}, with a length between 1 and 500000; `n` is the length of `s`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 500000.**
