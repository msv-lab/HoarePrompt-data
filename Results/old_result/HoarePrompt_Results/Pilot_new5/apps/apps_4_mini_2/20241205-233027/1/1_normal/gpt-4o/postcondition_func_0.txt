The function accepts a string `s` composed of lowercase Latin letters and specific characters ('[', ']', ':', '|'). It searches for the first occurrence of '[' and the last occurrence of ']', along with colons (':') between these brackets. If the conditions are met, it counts the number of pipes ('|') between the first colon after '[' and the last colon before ']', and returns this count plus 4. If any of the required characters are not found or the indices are not in the correct order, it returns -1.
