Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, and `i` is `bind - 2`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is a colon (`:`), then `end_colon` is set to `bind - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
