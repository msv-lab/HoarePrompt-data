The variable `pipe_count` is incremented by 1. Since `pipe_count` was initially 0, after the increment it becomes 1. The other variables in the initial state are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `bind` is at least `ind + 2`, `end_colon` is at least `start_colon + 2`, `i` is `ind + 1`, and `pipe_count` is now 1, with the character at index `i` in the string `s` still being '|'.
