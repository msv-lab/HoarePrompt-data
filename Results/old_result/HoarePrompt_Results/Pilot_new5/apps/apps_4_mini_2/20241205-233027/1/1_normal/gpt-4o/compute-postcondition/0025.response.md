The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is -1 or a valid index, `i` is `n - 2`, `bind` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
