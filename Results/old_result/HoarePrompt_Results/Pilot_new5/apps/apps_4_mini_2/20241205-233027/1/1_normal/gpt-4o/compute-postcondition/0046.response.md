`start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is previously defined as `ind + 3`. Therefore, `start_colon` will be equal to `ind + 3`. Other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 500000, `ind` is a valid index, `i` is `ind + 3`, `start_colon` is `ind + 3`, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3**.
