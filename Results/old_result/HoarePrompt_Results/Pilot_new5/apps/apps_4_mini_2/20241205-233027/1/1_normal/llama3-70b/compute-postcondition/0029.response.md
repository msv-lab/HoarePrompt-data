Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 0). If there exists at least one '[' before the first occurrence of ':', then `ind` will be the index of the first occurrence of ':' after the first '['; if no such ':' exists after the first '[', then `ind` remains -1. If there are no '[' characters in the string, then `ind` will remain -1 regardless of the presence of ':' in `s`. `f` will be True if at least one '[' was found; otherwise, `f` will be False.**
