The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on global or pre-defined variables for its operations (though this was not specified in the provided context). The function's output is based on certain conditions involving the values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`, which are integers bound by specific constraints. However, since the inputs are not explicitly passed as parameters to the function, we can't articulate the functionality in terms of parameters accepted. 

Given the typical constraints and relationships, we can interpret the expected behavior based on the values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d` if they were to influence the output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates based on pre-defined integers v_1, v_2, t, and d within specified limits, returning a result based on their values.**
