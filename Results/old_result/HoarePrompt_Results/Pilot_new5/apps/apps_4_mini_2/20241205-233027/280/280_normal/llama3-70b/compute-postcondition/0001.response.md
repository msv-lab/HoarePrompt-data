The variables `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, which will replace their previous values. The variables `v_1` and `v_2` are not affected by this code. The values of `t` and `d` must now satisfy the conditions provided: `t` remains an integer between 2 and 100, and `d` remains an integer between 0 and 10. 

Output State: **`v_1` and `v_2` are assigned the values from input (1 ≤ `v_1`, `v_2` ≤ 100); `t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10.**
