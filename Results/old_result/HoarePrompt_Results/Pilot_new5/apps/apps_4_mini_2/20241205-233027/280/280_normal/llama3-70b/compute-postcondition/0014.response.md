The statement `max_length += max_speed` increases the value of `max_length` by the current value of `max_speed`. The previous value of `max_length` was calculated as `max(v_1, v_2) * t + max_speed`. Hence, the new value of `max_length` will be `max(v_1, v_2) * t + max_speed + max_speed`, which simplifies to `max(v_1, v_2) * t + 2 * max_speed`.

The other variables remain unchanged, including `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `min_length`, and `i`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is now `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is now `max(v_1, v_2) * t + 2 * max_speed`, `min_length` is `min(v_1, v_2) * t + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 2`.**
