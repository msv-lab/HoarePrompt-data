To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop control parameters and their implications. 

The loop is defined as `for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1)`. This means that the loop will iterate starting from `t - 1` down to 1 (inclusive), as the range does not include the endpoint (0). 

1. The loop will execute if `t - 1` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2. This condition is already satisfied as per the state provided (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100).

2. The initial value of `i` at the start of the loop will be `t - 1`. So, depending on the value of `t`, `i` will take its starting value accordingly.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that:
- `t` is at least 2 (which it is, according to the state).
- `i` starts at `t - 1`.

At the start of the loop, the other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`) do not affect the execution condition of the loop directly, but they may be relevant in the loop body.

Therefore, the final state representation before the loop executes should include the value of `i`.

State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is max(`v_1`, `v_2`), `min_speed` is min(`v_1`, `v_2`), `max_length` is max(`v_1`, `v_2`) * `t`, `min_length` is min(`v_1`, `v_2`) * `t`, `i` is `t - 1`**
