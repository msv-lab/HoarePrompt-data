The values of `t` and `d` are assigned based on the input provided, which is split into two integers. The previous values of `t` and `d` are unknown since they are being overwritten by the input. The states of the other variables (`v1` and `v2`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will include the updated values of `t` and `d` as integers from the input and retain the constraints of the other variables.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), `t` is an integer (now updated from input), `d` is an integer (now updated from input).**
