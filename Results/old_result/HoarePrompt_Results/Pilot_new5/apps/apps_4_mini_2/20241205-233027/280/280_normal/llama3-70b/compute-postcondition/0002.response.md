The variable `max_speed` is assigned the value of the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`. Given the initial state, `v_1` and `v_2` can take on any values in the range from 1 to 100. The output state will reflect the value of `max_speed` as either `v_1` or `v_2`, depending on which is greater.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is the maximum of `v_1` and `v_2`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_1` ≤ 100), `v_2` is an input value (1 ≤ `v_2` ≤ 100), `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `d` is an input integer (0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10), `max_speed` is max(`v_1`, `v_2`)**
