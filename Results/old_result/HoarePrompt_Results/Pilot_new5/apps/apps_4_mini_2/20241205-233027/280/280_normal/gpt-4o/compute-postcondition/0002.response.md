The code initializes the list `speeds` with a length of `t`, where each element is set to 0. The variables `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` are not directly affected by this operation, but we note that `t` is now an integer updated from input. The variable `speeds` will now hold a list of zeros with a length equal to the value of `t`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100), `t` is an integer updated from input, `d` is an integer updated from input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` initialized to zeros.**
