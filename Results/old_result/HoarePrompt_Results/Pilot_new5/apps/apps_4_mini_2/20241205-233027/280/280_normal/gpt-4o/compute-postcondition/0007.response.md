According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is less than `t`. Currently, `i` is 1 and `t` is at least 2, which means the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is currently 1, for the next iteration, `i` will become 2. Additionally, `t` must remain at least 3 for the loop to continue executing beyond this next iteration. 

Therefore, the updated states should reflect that `i` is now 2 and `t` must be at least 3.

State: **`v1` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100), `v2` is an input integer (1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100), `t` must be at least 3, `d` is an integer updated from input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where speeds[0] is equal to `v1`, speeds[1] is equal to min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d), speeds[-1] is equal to `v2`, and `i` is 2**
