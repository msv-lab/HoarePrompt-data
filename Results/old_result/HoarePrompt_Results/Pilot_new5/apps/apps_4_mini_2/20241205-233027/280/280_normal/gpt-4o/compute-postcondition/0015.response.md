Functionality: ** The function accepts input values for two initial speeds `v1` and `v2`, a time period `t`, and a rate of increase `d`. It calculates a list of speeds over `t` time intervals, where the first speed is `v1`, the last speed is `v2`, and each intermediate speed is constrained by the previous speed plus `d` and a maximum that accounts for the remaining time intervals. Finally, the function computes and prints the total distance traveled based on the calculated speeds. It does not directly accept parameters but relies on user input. **
