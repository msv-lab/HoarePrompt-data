Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `x_found` is `True` if there exists at least one `mark` in `marks` such that `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in `marks_set`, otherwise `x_found` is `False`; `y_found` is `True` if there exists at least one `mark` in `marks` such that `mark + y` or `mark - y` exists in `marks_set`, otherwise `y_found` is `False`. The loop will terminate once both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, or iterate through all elements in `marks` if they are not found.**
