The value of `need_y` is explicitly set to `True`, which confirms its previous state. None of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, or the condition involving `marks`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the confirmed value of `need_y`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True**
