The value of `need_y` is assigned to `True`. This value indicates that the condition `marks[j] - marks[0]` equals `y` is satisfied. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True.**
