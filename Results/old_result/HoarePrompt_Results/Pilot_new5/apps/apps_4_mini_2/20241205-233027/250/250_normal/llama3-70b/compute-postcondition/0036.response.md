The value of `need_x` is assigned to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their states continue to hold true given the initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `need_y` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 3, and `need_x` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `need_y` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 3, and `need_x` is True.**
