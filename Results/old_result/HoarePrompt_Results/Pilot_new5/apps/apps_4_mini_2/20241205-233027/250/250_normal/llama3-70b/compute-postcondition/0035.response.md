According to the code, the loop executes based on the condition of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100000. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will become 3. Additionally, since `n` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `need_y` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 3**
