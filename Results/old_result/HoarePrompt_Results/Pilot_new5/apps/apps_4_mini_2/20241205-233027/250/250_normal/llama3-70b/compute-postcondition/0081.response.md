According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `additional_marks` iterable. Since the loop iterates over `additional_marks`, it must contain at least one element to execute at least once. Given that `n` is a positive integer, `marks` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element in `marks`, we need to ensure that `additional_marks` is defined and contains elements.

For the loop to be executed, the condition that needs to be satisfied is that `additional_marks` must have at least 1 element. We also note that `j` will take on the values from `additional_marks` starting from the first element.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `additional_marks` must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`**.
