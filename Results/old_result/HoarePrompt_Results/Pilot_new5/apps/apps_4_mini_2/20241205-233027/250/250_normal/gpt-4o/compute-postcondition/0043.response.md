Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `x_found` is False; `y_found` is False; if `x_found` is False and for each `mark` in `a`, if `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark + x`. Otherwise, if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is found in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark - x` for each `mark` in `a`. If neither condition is satisfied, then `new_marks` remains an empty set.***
