According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element in `marks`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element. The next element `j` in `additional_marks` must be such that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not present in `marks`. 

If `additional_marks` currently has `k` elements, then after this iteration, for the loop to be executed one more time, `additional_marks` needs to have at least `k + 1` elements. This means that the next `j` must be derived from the existing `i` and values in `additional_marks` such that the condition holds true.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `additional_marks` must have at least 1 more element, and the next `j` must satisfy the condition that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not present in `marks`.**
