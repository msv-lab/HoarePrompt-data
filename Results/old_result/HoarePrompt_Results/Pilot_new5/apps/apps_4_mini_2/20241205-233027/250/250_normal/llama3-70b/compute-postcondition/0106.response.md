The code prints the string representation of each element in `additional_marks`, joined by spaces. The code does not change the values of the variables but outputs the content of `additional_marks`. The number of elements in `additional_marks` corresponds to the length of the iterable, which is at least `n`.

Since the variables `n` and `marks` are unchanged and `additional_marks` is printed without being modified, we can summarize the output state reflecting the print action.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` contains the values added during loop execution, and the length of `additional_marks` is printed.**
