Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `marks` is a list of integers with at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing unique values from `marks`; `y_found` is False; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark - y`. If neither condition is met, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
