Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; if `y_found` is False, for each `mark` in `a`, if any of the conditions `mark + y + x in marks_set`, `mark + y - x in marks_set`, or `mark - y + x in marks_set` hold true, then `new_marks` will contain the value `mark + y`. If none of those conditions are satisfied, and if either `mark - y + x in marks_set` or `mark - y - x in marks_set` holds true, then `new_marks` will contain the value `mark - y`; otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged and `y_found` remains False. If `y_found` is True, then the state of the program is unchanged.***
