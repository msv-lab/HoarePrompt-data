Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a list of integers with at least one more element; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `y_found` is False; if `not y_found` is true, and any of the expressions `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark + y`. If none of these conditions are satisfied, but `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark - y`. If neither condition is met, then `new_marks` remains unchanged. If `y_found` is true, no changes are made to `new_marks`.***
