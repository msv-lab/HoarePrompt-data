The code creates a set from the list of `marks`. The list `marks` remains unchanged, but now we have a new variable `marks_set`, which contains unique values derived from `marks`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l, `marks` is now an input list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`.**
