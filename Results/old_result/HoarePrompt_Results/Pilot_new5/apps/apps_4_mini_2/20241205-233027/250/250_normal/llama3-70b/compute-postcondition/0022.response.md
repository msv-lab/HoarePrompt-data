According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, since `n` is at least 2, it will still be greater than `i` after the increment.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `need_x` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0]` equals `x`, otherwise it is False; `need_y` is True if there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0]` equals `y`, otherwise it is False.**
