The variable `mark` is defined as the next element in `marks`, and the operation `new_marks.add(mark - x)` adds the value `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. The only change is that `mark - x` is added to `new_marks`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing marks on the ruler; `marks` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `marks_set` is a set containing the unique values from `marks`; `y_found` is False; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `new_marks` now includes `mark - x`.**
