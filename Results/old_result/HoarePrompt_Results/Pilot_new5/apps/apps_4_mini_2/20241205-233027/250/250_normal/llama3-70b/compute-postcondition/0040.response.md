Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `need_x` is True if there exists at least one index `j` (where `j` is between 1 and `n-1`) such that `marks[j] - marks[1]` equals `x`, otherwise it is False; `need_y` is True if there exists at least one index `j` (where `j` is between 1 and `n-1`) such that `marks[j] - marks[1]` equals `y`, otherwise it is False.**
