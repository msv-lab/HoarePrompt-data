Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not already in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now contains `i + j` as an additional element.***
