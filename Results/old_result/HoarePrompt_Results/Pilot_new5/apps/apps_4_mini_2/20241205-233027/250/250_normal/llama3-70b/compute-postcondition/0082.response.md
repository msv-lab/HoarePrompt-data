Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `marks`, `additional_marks` must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not present in `marks`.***
