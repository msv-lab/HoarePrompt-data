To analyze the given code snippet, we know that `additional_marks` is an iterable that will be modified by appending a new value. The value being appended is the sum of `i` and `j`.

1. **Understanding Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
   - `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements.
   - `i` is the third element in `marks`.
   - `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` means that we will take the current values of `i` and `j`, sum them, and add this sum to the end of the `additional_marks` iterable.

3. **Values of Variables:**
   - We know that `i` equals the third element of `marks`.
   - We know that `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, but we don't have a specific numerical value for it from the initial state.

4. **Result of the Calculation:**
   - The new element added to `additional_marks` will be `i + j`.

5. **Output State:**
   - Since `n`, `marks`, and their relationship to `i` remain unchanged, we only need to update `additional_marks` to reflect the new value added.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` now has an additional element equal to `i + j`.**
