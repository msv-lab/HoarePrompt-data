The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned based on the input provided through `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the specific values for `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` will be whatever integers are entered as input, adhering to the constraints specified in the initial state. The list `a` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `l` is now an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, and `a` is a list of n integers representing marks on the ruler, where 0 = a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] = l.**
