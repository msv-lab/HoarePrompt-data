`additional_marks` is appended with the value of `i + j`. Given that `i` is the first element in `marks` and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` (if available), the output state will reflect this change. The states of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` (if available), and `additional_marks` now includes the value `i + j`.**
