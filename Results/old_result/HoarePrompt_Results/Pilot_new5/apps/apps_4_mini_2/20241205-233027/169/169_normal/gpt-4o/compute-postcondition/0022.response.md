The code `print(stones)` outputs the current value of the variable `stones`. The value of `stones` is derived from the operations represented in the string `s`, which consists of '+' and '-' characters that modify the result. Since `stones` can range from 0 to `n` based on the operations in `s`, its value is simply printed without modification. 

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged initial conditions and the printed value of `stones`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-', `stones` is the net result of applying all operations in `s`, which can range from 0 to `n`. Printed value is `stones`.**
