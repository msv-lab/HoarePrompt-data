According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the current index of iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `s` is a string of length `n`, meaning there are characters to process. 

If the loop has executed once, the `operation` corresponds to the current character in the string `s`. Assuming the loop has processed the character at index `i`, for the next iteration, the program will proceed with the character at index `i + 1`. 

Thus, if `n` is greater than 0 and `s` has had at least 1 character processed, then `operation` will be the character at index `i + 1` of `s`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operation` is the character at index `i + 1` of `s`**
