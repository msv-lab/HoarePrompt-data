Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`, `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`. If `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, the output is 0. Otherwise, the result of `plus_count - minus_count` is printed.***
