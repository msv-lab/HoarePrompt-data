The value of `plus_count` is assigned the result of `s.count('+')`, which counts the occurrences of the character '+' in the string `s`. The variable `s` remains unchanged, and the value of `minus_count` remains the same as before since it only counts the occurrences of '-'. The count of '+' will be a non-negative integer since `s` consists of '+' and '-' only. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `plus_count` based on the content of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`, `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`.**
