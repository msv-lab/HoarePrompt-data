The code snippet `print(abs(x - y))` computes the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints it. The initial state specifies the constraints on `y` and `x`, but it does not provide their specific values. Since `y` is between 3 and x (inclusive for 3 and exclusive for x), the exact output will depend on the specific input values provided for `x` and `y`. However, the output will always be a non-negative integer as it represents the absolute difference.

The output state maintains the constraints on `y` and `x` while also noting that the absolute difference (let's denote it as `d`) has been printed.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `d` is the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` printed.**
