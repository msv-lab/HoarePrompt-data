The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any parameters in its signature. Instead, it works with the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. 

The function's output is based on the values of these integers. However, since the exact output behavior is not provided in the prompt, we can only infer information about the input constraints.

Given the constraints, the function must operate with the integers `x` and `y` under the specified conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to ensure that it will interact correctly with integers `x` and `y` that meet these criteria.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and performs operations based on these constraints.**
