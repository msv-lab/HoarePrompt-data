The expression `(x - y) // 2` represents the integer division of the difference between `x` and `y` by 2, while `(x - y) % 2` gives the remainder of that difference divided by 2. Since `x` and `y` are integers and satisfy the condition `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the value of `(x - y)` is always a positive integer. Therefore, the result of the print statement will compute the average of the difference between `x` and `y`, rounding down, plus an additional 1 if the difference is odd.

The output state will reflect the values of `x`, `y`, and the computed expression. However, the values of `x` and `y` will remain unchanged in the output state.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers as per the user input, such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000; result is (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2**
