The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `ways` is the count of valid pairs and there are no other specifications affecting the other variables, the only change is to the `ways` variable. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 8, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `ways` is incremented by 1**.
