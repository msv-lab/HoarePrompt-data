The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) and returns 0 if `n` is less than 6. If `n` is 6 or greater, it calculates and returns the total number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b)` is less than `n` and `rem`, the remainder after subtracting `2 * (a + b)` from `n`, is positive and even. The valid pairs are counted based on the condition that `a` must not equal `rem // 2`.
