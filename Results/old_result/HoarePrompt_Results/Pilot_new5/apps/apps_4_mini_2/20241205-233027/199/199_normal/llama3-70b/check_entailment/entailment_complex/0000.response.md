Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that it can form a rectangle but not a square. 

Here are the key issues:

1. **Logic for Rectangles vs. Squares**:
   - The problem requires splitting the stick into four parts where two parts are equal (say a) and the other two parts are equal (say b). This allows the formation of a rectangle (since opposite sides are equal) and ensures that it is not a square (where all four parts would be equal). 
   - The logic in the provided function focuses solely on counting pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) == n`, which does not guarantee that `a` and `b` are equal on separate pairs. This means it does not check for the scenario where `n` could be split into exactly two distinct pairs, which is crucial for the rectangle formation without creating a square.

2. **Handling of Odd Values of n**:
   - The function explicitly states that if `n` is odd, it will return 0. However, it ignores the fact that certain even values of `n` might not yield valid pairs that meet the rectangle requirement without forming a square.

3. **Return Value and Counting Mechanism**:
   - The counting mechanism (`ways += 1`) is only incremented when a rather specific condition is met (i.e., `2 * (a + b) == n`). This is insufficient as it does not explore all potential splits of the stick into four distinct positive lengths that meet the overall criteria.

4. **Range of Values**:
   - The loop ranges (`for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1)` and `for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)`) are incorrectly structured to ensure valid pairs `(a, b)` for rectangle formation. The pairs need to be formed in a way that both halves of the stick can be used to create parts intended for rectangle formation.

Due to these fundamental flaws in logic, the implementation does not satisfy the requirements laid out in the problem description.
