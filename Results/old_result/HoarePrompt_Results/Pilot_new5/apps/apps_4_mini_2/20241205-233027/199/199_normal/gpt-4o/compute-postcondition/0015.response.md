After executing the code `count += 1`, the variable `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 1, so the new value will be 2. The values of the other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `rem` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 8, `count` is 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `rem` is equal to `n - 8`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 8, `count` is 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `rem` is equal to `n - 8**.
