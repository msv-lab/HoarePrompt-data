`ways` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 10 is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 10; `a` is 2; `b` is 3; `ways` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 10; `a` is 2; `b` is 3; `ways` is incremented by 1.**
