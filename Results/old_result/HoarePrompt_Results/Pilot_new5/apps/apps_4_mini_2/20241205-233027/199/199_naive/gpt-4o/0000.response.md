To analyze the given program based on the problem description, let's break down the logic and requirements.

The task is to determine how many distinct ways we can cut a wooden stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. It is possible to form a rectangle with those parts.
2. It is impossible to form a square with those parts.
3. Each part must have a positive integer length.

From the implementation of the provided function `func_1(n)`:
- It first checks if `n < 6`, returning `0` since it is impossible to split the stick into four positive parts.
- It then enters a loop where it iterates over possible lengths `a`, which is set equal to `b`, and calculates the remainder `rem` after accounting for `2(a + b)`.
- The program checks if `rem` is positive and even, since for a rectangle we need two pairs of equal sides.
- It also ensures that `a` is not equal to `rem // 2` to prevent forming squares.

Now, let's identify potential cases where this logic could fail:

1. **Edge Case for Minimum Valid Input**: For `n=6`, the only valid combination to form a rectangle is `{1, 1, 2, 2}` which satisfies the requirement. The function returns `1`, which is correct.
  
2. **General Case for n=10**: 
   - The valid combinations would be:
     - `{1, 1, 4, 4}` (rectangle, not a square)
     - `{2, 2, 3, 3}` (rectangle, not a square)
   - However, the function would not account for `{2, 2, 3, 3}` since it would check `if a != rem // 2` with `a = 2`, `rem = 6`, and `rem // 2 = 3`. This is correct as it doesn't form a square. 

3. **Problematic Case for n=14**: 
   - Valid pairs are:
     - `{1, 1, 6, 6}`
     - `{2, 2, 5, 5}`
     - `{3, 3, 4, 4}`
   - The function will only consider `{1, 1, 6, 6}` and `{2, 2, 5, 5}` but will miss `{3, 3, 4, 4}` because `a` will be `3` and it checks if `3` is equal to `rem//2` (which is `7 // 2 = 3`). Thus, it will incorrectly return `2` instead of `3`.

Thus, there is at least one case where the program fails to consider a valid combination of parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. 

Correctness: **False**.
