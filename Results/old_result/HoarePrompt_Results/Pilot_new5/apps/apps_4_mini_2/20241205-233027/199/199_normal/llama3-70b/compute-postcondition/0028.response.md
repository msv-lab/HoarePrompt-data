The code increments the value of `ways` by 1. The initial state specifies that `ways` counts valid pairs where `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b) = n`, which means `ways` currently holds a count of valid pairs. Other variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `ways` is the count of valid pairs (1, b) such that `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b) = n; `ways` is incremented by 1.**
