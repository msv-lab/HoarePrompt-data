Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that a rectangle can be formed but not a square. 

Upon analyzing the code, an issue arises in the loop where it iterates through values of `a`. The program only considers cases where `a`, `b`, and `rem` (the remaining part of the stick) are derived from the assumption that two parts are equal (`a` and `b`). It does not account for all combinations of pairs that could form a rectangle, particularly when `a` and `b` could take different positive integer values while still ensuring the total adds up to `n`.

For example, with `n = 10`, the program would only check pairs like `{1, 1, 4, 4}` and `{2, 2, 3, 3}`, but it misses combinations like `{2, 2, 3, 3}` since `rem` would be 0 in this case, which is invalid. Additionally, it does not check for cases where `a` and `b` could be different while still forming valid rectangles.

Thus, the program fails to cover all potential cases required by the problem statement, leading to incorrect outputs. For instance, for `n = 10`, the expected output should be `1` (for `{2, 2, 3, 3}`), but the program would return `0`. 

Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect based on its inability to account for all valid configurations as required by the problem description.
