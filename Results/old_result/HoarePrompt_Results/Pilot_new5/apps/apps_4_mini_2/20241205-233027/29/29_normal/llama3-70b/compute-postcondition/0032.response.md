The `print(line)` statement outputs the value of `line`. The value of `line` is specified as the first string in `script`, which is guaranteed to exist since `script` has at least one string. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the existing values of all variables with an emphasis on the output produced by the `print` statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order, `examples` is a list that can have at least 0 elements, `regular` must contain `n` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + n`, `file` is the last element of `regular`, `script` has at least 1 string, `line` is the first string in `script`, and `line` has been printed.**
