The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous condition states that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, so after the increment, it will be `temp_counter` is now within the range of `1` to `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to its previous value and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1, and `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.**
