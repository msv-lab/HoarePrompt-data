The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` was adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, after the increment, `temp_counter` will be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state remains as described.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` should be in `files_set`.**
