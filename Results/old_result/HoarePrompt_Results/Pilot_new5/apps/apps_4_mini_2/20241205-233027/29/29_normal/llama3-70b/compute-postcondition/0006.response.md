The variable `name` is assigned the value returned from `input().split()`, which will split the input string into two parts. The first part will be stored in `name`, and the second part, converted to an integer, will be stored in `type_`. The previous values of `n`, `files`, and `_` remain unchanged. 

As the input values are not specified, the output state will reflect that `name` is now a string (the first part of the input) and `type_` is an integer (the second part of the input).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing the tuple (name, int(type_)), `_` is 1, `name` is a string, `type_` is an integer.**
