Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` contains string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` is a list containing updated filenames from `files` where the type is '0', `moves` contains all move instructions made, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + len(regulars)`, and for each `regulars[i]`, it holds the condition that `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(len(examples) + i + 1)` if it was originally equal, or it has been modified to an appropriate value based on the conditions of the loop. If `regulars[i]` was not equal to the expected target, the final state also includes the appropriate entries in `moves` reflecting any changes made during the iterations.**
