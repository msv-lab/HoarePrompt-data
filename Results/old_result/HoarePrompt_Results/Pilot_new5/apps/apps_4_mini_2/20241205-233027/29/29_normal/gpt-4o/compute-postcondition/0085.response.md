Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` contains string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` is a list containing filenames from `files` where the type is '0' and has at least one element. If `regulars[0]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, then `moves` now contains the instruction `move {regulars[0]} {target}`, `i` remains 0, `temp_counter` is added to the start of `regulars`, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, and `files_set` does not contain the string representation of `temp_counter`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
