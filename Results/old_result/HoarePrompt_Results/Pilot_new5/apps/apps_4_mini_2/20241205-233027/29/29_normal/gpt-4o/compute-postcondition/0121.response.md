The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `files`, where each file is represented as a tuple containing a string (filename) and an integer (type). It sorts the filenames into two categories based on their type: '1' for example tests and '0' for regular tests. The function then generates move instructions to ensure that all example filenames are represented as integers from `1` to `n`, while also adjusting the filenames of regular tests to follow sequentially after the examples, ensuring no duplicates. 

The function checks if any filenames need to be moved to make them compliant with this structure, utilizing a temporary counter to avoid conflicts with existing filenames. Finally, it returns a list of all move instructions made during the process.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` is 0, resulting in an empty `files` list, the function will still return an empty list of moves.
- The function does not handle cases where an invalid filename format is present in the `files` list.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `files`, categorizes the filenames into examples and regular tests, and generates move instructions to ensure the filenames follow a sequential order from `1` to `n`, returning a list of these instructions. If `n` is 0, it returns an empty list.**
