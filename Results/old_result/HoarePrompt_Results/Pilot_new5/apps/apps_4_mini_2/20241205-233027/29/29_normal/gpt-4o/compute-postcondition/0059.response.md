The `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous condition states that `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`. Since `temp_counter` was valid under this condition before the increment, it will remain valid after the increment only if the new value of `temp_counter` is still within the specified limit. The other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged in value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1` and now `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.**
