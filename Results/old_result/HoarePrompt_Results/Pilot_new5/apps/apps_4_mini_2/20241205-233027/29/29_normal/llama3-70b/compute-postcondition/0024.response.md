`script` is a list that now appends a string formatted as 'move {file} {i}'. The value of `file` is the first element of `regular`, and the value of `i` is `len(examples) + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted in descending order, `examples` is a list that can have at least 0 elements, `regular` must contain at least 1 element, `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `file` is the first element of `regular`, and `script` now includes the string `move {file} {i}`.**
