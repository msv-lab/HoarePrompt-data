According to the code, the loop can continue executing as long as `i` is less than the length of `regulars`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is the current index being processed in `regulars`, and after the loop body, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, and `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, we have the following states:
- `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, meaning that for `temp_counter` to change, it must be incremented by 1, so in the next iteration it will be `temp_counter + 1`.
- The condition `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)` and the subsequent assignment to `regulars[i]` and increment of `temp_counter` will occur if `i` is still in range.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented, and the length of `regulars` must remain the same.

Thus, the next values would be:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `temp_counter` will be `temp_counter + 1`.

Hence, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `i` is the next index in range(len(regulars))**
