The variable `examples[i]` is assigned the string representation of `temp_counter`. The value of `temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 1` and `2 * n + k`, hence `examples[i]` becomes a string that represents a number in that range. The states of the other variables (`n`, `moves`) are not affected directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 1` and `2 * n + k`, `n` is a positive integer, `examples[i]` is the string representation of `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is between `2 * n + 1` and `2 * n + k`, `n` is a positive integer, `examples[i]` is str(temp_counter)**
