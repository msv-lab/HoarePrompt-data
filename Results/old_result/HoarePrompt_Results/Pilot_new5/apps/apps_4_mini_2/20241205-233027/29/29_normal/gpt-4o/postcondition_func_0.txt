The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `files`, categorizes the filenames into examples and regular tests, and generates move instructions to ensure the filenames follow a sequential order from `1` to `n`, returning a list of these instructions. If `n` is 0, it returns an empty list.
