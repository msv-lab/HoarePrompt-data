To determine the adjustments needed for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the loop condition.

The loop condition is:
```python
temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set
```

1. **Evaluating `temp_counter <= 2 * n`:**  
   - We know that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, which means `temp_counter` cannot be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Therefore, this part of the condition is already false.

2. **Evaluating `str(temp_counter) in files_set`:**  
   - We know that `str(temp_counter)` is currently not in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions need to be true:
- The first condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`) needs to be adjusted so that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Given the current state, this can be adjusted by either decreasing `temp_counter` or increasing `n`.
- The second condition (`str(temp_counter) in files_set`) also needs to be true, meaning `str(temp_counter)` must be added to `files_set` or `temp_counter` must be adjusted to a value whose string representation is in `files_set`.

After analyzing these conditions, we conclude that:
- `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- Alternatively, we could change `files_set` to include `str(temp_counter)` if we keep `temp_counter` as is.

Since the current conditions as described will not allow the loop to execute, we need to modify them:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
