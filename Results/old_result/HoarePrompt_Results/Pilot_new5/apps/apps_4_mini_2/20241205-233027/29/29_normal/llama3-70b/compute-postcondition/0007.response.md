The code `files.append((name, int(type_)))` adds a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the `files` list. The variable `type_` is converted to an integer, but it is already an integer in the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing the previous tuples and now includes the new tuple `(name, type_)`, `_` is 1, `name` is a string, `type_` is an integer.**
