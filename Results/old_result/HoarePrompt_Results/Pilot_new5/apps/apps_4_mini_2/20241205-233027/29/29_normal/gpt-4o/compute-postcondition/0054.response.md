According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and `files_set`. For the loop to execute, the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` must be true and `str(temp_counter)` must exist in `files_set`.

Right before the loop, we have `n` as a positive integer, but we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and that `str(temp_counter)` is indeed in `files_set`. If `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` or if `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we can adjust the state of `temp_counter` to be equal to or less than `2 * n`, and confirm that `str(temp_counter)` exists in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**.
