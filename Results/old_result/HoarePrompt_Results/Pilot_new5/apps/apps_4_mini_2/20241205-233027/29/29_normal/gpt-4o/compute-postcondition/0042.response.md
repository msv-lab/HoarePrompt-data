`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, after the increment, it must still satisfy this condition. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n` and is now incremented by 1.**
