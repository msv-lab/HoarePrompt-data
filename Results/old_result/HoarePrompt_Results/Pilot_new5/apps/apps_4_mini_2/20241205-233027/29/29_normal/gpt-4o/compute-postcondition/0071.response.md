Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` contains string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` is a list containing filenames from `files` where the type is '0' and must have at least 1 element, `moves` is a list of all move instructions made, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `target` is `n + 1`, and the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target` (i.e., `regulars[i]` is not equal to str(n + 1)).***
