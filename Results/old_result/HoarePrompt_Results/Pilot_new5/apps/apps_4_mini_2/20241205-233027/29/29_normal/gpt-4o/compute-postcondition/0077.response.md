The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n`, but the specific previous value of `temp_counter` is not given. However, we know that after the increment, `temp_counter` will equal `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` contains string representations of integers from `1` to `n`, `regulars` is a list containing filenames from `files` where the type is '0' and must have at least 1 element, `moves` is a list of all move instructions made, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, and `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`.**
