Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here is an explanation of why the program meets the criteria for determining the number of good pairs (a, b) given the constraints:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads four integer inputs l, r, x, and y, ensuring that the constraints (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9) are respected.

2. **Multiple Check**: The first check in the function verifies if y is a multiple of x. This is crucial because for any pairs (a, b) to satisfy GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, y must indeed be divisible by x (since LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)).

3. **Divisor Iteration**: The program uses a loop to iterate through all possible divisors of z (where z = y / x). For each divisor i, it derives the potential values of a and b as follows:
   - a = i * x
   - b = (z / i) * x
   This relationship correctly reflects the GCD and LCM properties defined in the problem.

4. **Range and Validity Checks**: The program checks if both a and b fall within the specified range [l, r]. It also verifies that the GCD of a and b is indeed x and their product equals y. These checks ensure that the pairs found are valid.

5. **Counting Pairs**: The counting mechanism correctly distinguishes between (a, b) and (b, a) pairs. If a is equal to b, it counts that pair only once; otherwise, it counts both combinations.

6. **Output**: The function ultimately returns the total count of valid pairs, consistent with the requirements to output this count.

All of these steps ensure that the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases, leading to an accurate count of good pairs of integers (a, b). Thus, the program is correct.
