The function accepts four integer parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`. It first checks if `y` is a multiple of `x`; if not, it returns 0. If `y` is a multiple of `x`, it calculates pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that both are within the range `[l, r]`, their greatest common divisor is `x`, and their product equals `y`. It counts valid pairs, returning the count, which may include duplicates if `a` is equal to `b`. The function effectively counts valid pairs based on specific divisibility and range conditions.
