The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`. All parameters are integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9. 

The functionality of the function is as follows:
- In Case 1, if certain conditions are met, the function returns 0.
- In Case 2, if those conditions are not met, the function returns the total number of valid pairs (a, b) found based on specified conditions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integers `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, and return either 0 or the count of valid pairs (a, b) based on the defined criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l, r, x, and y, and returns 0 under specific conditions or the total number of valid pairs (a, b) based on other conditions.**
