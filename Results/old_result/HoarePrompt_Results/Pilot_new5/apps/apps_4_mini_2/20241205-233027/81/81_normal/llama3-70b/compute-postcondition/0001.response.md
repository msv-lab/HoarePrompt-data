The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, with the constraint that `a` is less than or equal to `b`, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is a divisor of the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. After executing the function body, it returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b`, then dividing by the result of another function, `func_1(a, b)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is less than or equal to `b`, and return the result of the expression involving their multiplication and the output of `func_1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, which are positive integers with the condition a â‰¤ b, and returns the result of (a multiplied by b) divided by func_1(a, b).**
