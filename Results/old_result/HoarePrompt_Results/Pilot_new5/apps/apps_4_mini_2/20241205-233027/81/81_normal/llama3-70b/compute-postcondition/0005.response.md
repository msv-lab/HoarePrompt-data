The variable `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is updated to be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. Given the initial values `a` is `b_initial` and `b` must be adjusted to be non-zero, after the operation, `a` will take the value of `b`, which is modified, and `b` will be updated to `a_initial % b_initial`. The variables affected are `a` and `b`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `b_initial`, `b` is `a_initial % b_initial`**
