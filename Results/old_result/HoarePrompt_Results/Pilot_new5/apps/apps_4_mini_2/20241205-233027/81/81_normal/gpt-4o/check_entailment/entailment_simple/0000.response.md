Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, within the specified bounds l and r. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads four integers l, r, x, and y, ensuring they meet the constraints given in the problem description.

2. **GCD and LCM Relationship**: The function checks if y is a multiple of x. This is a necessary condition because for any two integers a and b, GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. Therefore, if GCD(a, b) = x, then LCM(a, b) must be a multiple of x (in this case, y). If this condition is not met, the function correctly returns 0.

3. **Finding Valid Pairs**:
   - The program calculates z as y // x. This transformation is crucial because if the pairs (a, b) have a GCD of x, then both a and b can be expressed in terms of x.
   - It iterates over all divisors of z (which is efficient, as it only checks up to the square root of z). For each divisor i:
     - It calculates a = i * x and b = (z // i) * x.
     - It checks if both a and b lie within the bounds [l, r].
     - It verifies the conditions: GCD(a, b) should equal x and LCM(a, b) should equal y. The program uses the properties of GCD and LCM to confirm this.

4. **Counting Pairs**: The counting logic differentiates between the cases where a equals b (counts once) and where a is different from b (counts twice, as (a, b) and (b, a) are distinct).

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the program returns the total count of valid pairs, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

The program accounts for all necessary conditions and constraints, thus it correctly adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.
