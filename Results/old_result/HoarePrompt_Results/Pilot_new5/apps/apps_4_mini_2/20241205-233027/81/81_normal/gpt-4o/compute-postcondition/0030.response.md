Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers within the range (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9); `x` and `y` are integers such that (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9); `z` is `y // x`; `i` is now `i + 1`; `a` is `(i + 1) * x`; `b` is `(y // x) // (i + 1) * x`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 2.***
