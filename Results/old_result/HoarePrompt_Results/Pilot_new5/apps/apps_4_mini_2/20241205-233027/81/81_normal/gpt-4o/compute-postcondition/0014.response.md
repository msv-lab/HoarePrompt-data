Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers within the range (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are integers such that (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `z`, defined as `y // x`, is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `count` is set to 1, and both `a` and `b` maintain their values as `l <= a <= r`, `l <= b <= r`, `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, with the additional condition that `a` is equal to `b`. Otherwise, if `a` is not equal to `b`, `count` is set to 2, with `a` and `b` still satisfying the conditions `l <= a <= r`, `l <= b <= r`, `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`.***
