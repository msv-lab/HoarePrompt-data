The variable `z` is assigned the value of `y // x`, which is the integer division of `y` by `x`. Given that `y` is a multiple of `x`, `z` will be an integer value. The states of the other variables `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9; `z` is equal to `y // x`.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9; `z` is equal to `y // x`.**
