The value of `result` is updated as follows: `result` is assigned the value of `result * i % mod`. Given the initial values, `result` is 2, and `i` is 3. The value of `mod` is not provided, so it remains unspecified. Therefore, the value of `result` after this operation becomes `2 * 3 % mod`, which is equal to `6 % mod`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `result` is equal to `6 % mod`, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `result` is equal to `6 % mod`, `i` is 3**.
