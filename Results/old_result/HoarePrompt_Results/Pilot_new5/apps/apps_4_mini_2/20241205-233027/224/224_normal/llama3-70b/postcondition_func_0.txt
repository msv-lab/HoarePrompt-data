The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function handles the case where either `a` or `b` is zero, as the GCD is well-defined in those scenarios. If both `a` and `b` are zero, the function will return 0 as per convention.
