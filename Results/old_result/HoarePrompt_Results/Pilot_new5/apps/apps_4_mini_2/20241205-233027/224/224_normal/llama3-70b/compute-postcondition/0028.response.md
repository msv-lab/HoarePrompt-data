The variable `dp[j]` is updated with the modulo operation `dp[j] %= MOD`. The value of `j` is 2, so it specifically updates `dp[2]` to `dp[2] % MOD`. The other variables and states are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`, `dp[0]` is updated to `dp[0] % MOD`**
