According to the code, the for loop will execute if the range specified in `range(f_max_n, 0, -1)` has at least one element. The `f_max_n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. In the current state, `j` starts at -1, and `i` is 3, which does not impact the loop execution directly.

- Since `f_max_n` is at least 2, the loop will start with `j` being 2 in the first iteration.
- The loop will decrement `j` until it reaches 1 (it will not execute when `j` is 0).
- The value of `j` is updated to the starting point of the loop, which is `f_max_n` (at least 2).

Thus, the states need to be adjusted so that the initial value of `j` reflects the starting value of the loop, which is `f_max_n`. 

State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`, `dp[0]` is updated to `dp[0] % MOD`**
