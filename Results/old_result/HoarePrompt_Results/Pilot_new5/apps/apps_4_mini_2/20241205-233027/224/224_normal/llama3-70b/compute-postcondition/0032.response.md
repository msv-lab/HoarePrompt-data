According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f_max_n`. The loop will execute while `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, which means the loop can execute one more time if `j` is decremented to 0. After this iteration, `j` will be updated to 0. 

Since the loop runs from `f_max_n` down to 1, for the loop to execute again, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, as it will be the starting value of `j`. Therefore, after the next iteration, `j` will be 0.

State: **`j` is 0, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`, `dp[0]` is updated to `dp[0] % MOD`.**
