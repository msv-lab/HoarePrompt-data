The value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is 1, this means that `dp[1]` will be updated to `dp[1] + dp[0]`. The values of `dp[2]`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[0]` are still defined as being updated to `% MOD`, and the other states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] + dp[0] % MOD`, `dp[0]` is updated to `dp[0] % MOD`**
