The code initializes a list `dp` with zeros, where the length of the list is `f_max_n + 1`. The other variables remain unaffected. The output state reflects the dimensions of the newly created list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer that represents the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of integers 1 to n; `MOD` is 1000000007; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized with zeros.**
