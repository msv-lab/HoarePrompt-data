According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given as a positive integer within the range 2 to \(10^6\), the loop can execute as `i` will iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive). 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1. The state of `dp` at index 0 is also relevant, but it is already initialized correctly. Thus, there are no discrepancies to correct regarding `dp`. 

So, the states that need to be confirmed for the loop to execute are that `n` is within the specified bounds and `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1**
