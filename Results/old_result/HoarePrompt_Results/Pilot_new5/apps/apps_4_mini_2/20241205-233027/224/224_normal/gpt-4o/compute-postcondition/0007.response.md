To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we observe the following:

1. The loop iterates from `i = 2` up to `n`, which means it will execute a total of `n - 1` times, provided that `n` is at least 2.
2. In each iteration, the `result` variable is updated by multiplying it with the current value of `i` and then taking the modulus with `mod`.
3. At the end of the loop, the `result` will hold the value of the product of all integers from `2` to `n`, taken modulo `mod`.

Considering these points, let's summarize the output state after all iterations have finished:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6, `result` is equal to the product of integers from 2 to `n` modulo `mod`.**
