The variable `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is 2, this means `dp[2]` is increased by the value of `dp[1]`. The values of `i`, `f_max_n`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Assuming `dp` is a predefined list or array that holds values, the state of `dp` at index 2 will depend on the initial value of `dp[2]` and the value of `dp[1]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `dp[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` is at least 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] + dp[1]`.**
