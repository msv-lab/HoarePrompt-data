The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `f_max_n`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer within the range of 2 to 10^6, while `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer that signifies the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of integers from 1 to `n`. After executing the function body, it returns the number of combinations up to `f_max_n` based on the original values stored in `dp`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to take a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `f_max_n`, and return the count of combinations that are limited by `f_max_n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer between 2 and 10^6) and f_max_n (a non-negative integer), and returns the number of combinations up to f_max_n based on the values stored in dp.**
