To evaluate the code snippet, we start with the initial state:

Initial State: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

The code provided is:
```
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

1. `min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of the three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. The expression in the `print` statement computes:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`
   - This can be simplified as:
     - `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)` which is equal to `min_lemon * 7`.

In this case, the `print` function outputs the value `min_lemon * 7`, but it does not change the state of any variables. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `min_lemon` remain the same after the execution of the print statement.

Therefore, the Output State, including the unchanged variables, is:
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4.**
