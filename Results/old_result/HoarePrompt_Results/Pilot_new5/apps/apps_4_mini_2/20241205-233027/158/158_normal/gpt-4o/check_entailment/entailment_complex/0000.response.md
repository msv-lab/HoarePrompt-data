Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's why it meets the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes three positive integers as input representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The inputs are read correctly, and given the constraints (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000), the program is expected to receive valid inputs.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: According to the recipe, the fruits must be in the ratio 1:2:4. The program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`) by finding the minimum value among:
   - `a` (the available lemons),
   - `b // 2` (since each lemon requires 2 apples), and
   - `c // 4` (since each lemon requires 4 pears).

   This correctly ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed what is available based on the ratios defined in the problem.

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`. This takes into account the contribution of each type of fruit to the total count, which matches the description's requirement.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote, following the logic laid out in the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge case when no fruits can be used to make the compote. If the available fruits do not meet the required ratios, `max_lemons` will be zero, leading to a total of 0 fruits being printed.

Overall, the program adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description, ensuring that all calculations and outputs align with the expected results.
