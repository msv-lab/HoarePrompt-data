To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, letâ€™s analyze how the program functions in relation to the requirements:

1. **Inputs**: The program reads three integers from input: `a` (lemons), `b` (apples), and `c` (pears). This matches the problem description.

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: The program calculates `max_lemons` using the formula `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This is correct because:
   - Each lemon requires 2 apples, so the number of lemons that can be made is limited by the available apples (`b // 2`).
   - Each lemon also requires 4 pears, so the number of lemons that can be made is limited by the available pears (`c // 4`).
   - The `min` function correctly identifies the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the available quantities.

3. **Calculating Total Fruits**: The program computes `total_fruits` as:
   - `max_lemons * 1` for lemons,
   - `max_lemons * 2` for apples,
   - `max_lemons * 4` for pears.
   Thus, the total number of fruits used is effectively `max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7`, which matches the requirement to calculate the total fruit used in the ratio of 1:2:4.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits used.

### Edge Cases:
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` are insufficient to create even one complete set of compote (for example, if `b < 2` or `c < 4`), the `min` function will yield `0` for `max_lemons`, resulting in a total output of `0`. This is consistent with the problem requirements where it states that "it is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits."

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It correctly handles various cases, including when the quantities of fruits are insufficient to form even one complete portion of the compote.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
