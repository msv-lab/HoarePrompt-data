To determine the output state after executing the given code, let's analyze the provided initial state and the effect of the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `b` is a positive integer equal to `input integer`
- `c` is an input integer
- `a` is an input positive integer
- `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

The code snippet performs the following operation:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

Now, we can break down the effect of this code:

1. `total_fruits` is calculated as:
   - `max_lemons * 1` evaluates to `max_lemons`
   - `max_lemons * 2` evaluates to `2 * max_lemons`
   - `max_lemons * 4` evaluates to `4 * max_lemons`

2. Thus, 
   ```
   total_fruits = max_lemons + 2 * max_lemons + 4 * max_lemons
   total_fruits = 7 * max_lemons
   ```

After running the code, the variable `total_fruits` is now defined and holds the value of `7 * max_lemons`.

All other variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`b` is a positive integer equal to `input integer`, `c` is an input integer, `a` is an input positive integer, `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4), total_fruits` is equal to `7 * max_lemons`.**
