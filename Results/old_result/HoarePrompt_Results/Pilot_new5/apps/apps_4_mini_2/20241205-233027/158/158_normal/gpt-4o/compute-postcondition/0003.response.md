The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum of three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Here, `b` is a positive integer equal to `input integer`, `c` is an input integer, and `a` is an input positive integer. The values of `b`, `c`, and `a` will determine `max_lemons` as follows:

- `b // 2` will be half of the positive integer `b`.
- `c // 4` will be one-fourth of the integer `c`.

Since `a` is also a positive integer, `max_lemons` will be the smallest value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

The output state will summarize the conditions of the remaining variables while also providing the calculated value of `max_lemons`.

Output State: **`b` is a positive integer equal to `input integer`, `c` is an input integer, `a` is an input positive integer, `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`**.
