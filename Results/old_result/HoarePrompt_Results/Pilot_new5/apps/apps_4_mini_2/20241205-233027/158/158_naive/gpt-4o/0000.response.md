Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to prepare the compote according to the specified ratio (1:2:4). It does so by determining the limiting factor in the number of lemons, apples, and pears available. The function `func` reads the counts of each fruit, calculates how many complete sets of the fruit ratio can be formed using the minimum value from the calculated maximum number of lemons, apples divided by 2, and pears divided by 4. It then computes and prints the total number of fruits used in the compote.

The program handles various cases correctly, including:
- If there are not enough fruits to meet the ratio (as shown in the example with inputs `2, 3, 2`).
- If there are enough fruits to maximize the totals (as with inputs `4, 7, 13`).

In all potential input scenarios within the specified range (1 to 1000 for each fruit), the program adheres to the problem's requirements.
