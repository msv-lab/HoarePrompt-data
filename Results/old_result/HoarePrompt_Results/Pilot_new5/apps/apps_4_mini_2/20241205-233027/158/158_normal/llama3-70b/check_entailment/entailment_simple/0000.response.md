The provided program is designed to compute the maximum number of whole fruits that can be used to make compote based on the ratio of lemons, apples, and pears required for the recipe. 

### Problem Analysis:
According to the recipe:
- For every 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears are needed.
- The program receives inputs for the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c) and computes how many complete sets of the fruits can be used.

### Examination of the Program:
1. The program reads the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c) from user input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets (min_lemon) by finding the minimum of:
   - a (number of lemons available)
   - b // 2 (number of complete sets of apples available since 2 apples are needed for each lemon)
   - c // 4 (number of complete sets of pears available since 4 pears are needed for each lemon)
3. The total fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
   - min_lemon (lemons) + min_lemon * 2 (apples) + min_lemon * 4 (pears)
   - This simplifies to min_lemon * 7, which is the total number of fruits used based on the ratio.

### Correctness Verification:
- The computation correctly identifies the limiting factor in the number of complete compote sets based on the available fruits.
- It ensures that the required ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears) is maintained by using integer division for apples and pears to ensure whole fruits are counted.
- The program provides a correct answer even when no complete sets can be made (if `min_lemon` is 0, the output will be 0).

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements set out in the problem description for every potential case, including edge cases where not enough fruits are available to make even a single set.

Correctness: **True**
