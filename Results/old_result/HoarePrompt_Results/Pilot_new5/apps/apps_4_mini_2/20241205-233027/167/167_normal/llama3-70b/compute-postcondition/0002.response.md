The values of `nx` and `ny` are computed based on the value of `v` and `y`. Since `v` is the first integer in the list `a`, it will be used in the calculations. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as `(v - 1) // y` and `ny` as `(v - 1) % y`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `v` remain unchanged, but the new values of `nx` and `ny` depend on the specific integer values of `v` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers, `v` is the first integer in the list `a`, `nx` is (v - 1) // y, `ny` is (v - 1) % y**
