Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `v` is the second integer in the list `a`. If the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the program returns False. If the condition is not met, nothing specific is returned.***
