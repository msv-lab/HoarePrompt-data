Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `v` is the third integer in the list `a`, `px` is equal to `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is equal to `(v - 1) % y`. If the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px)` and `abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. If the condition is satisfied, no return value is specified.***
