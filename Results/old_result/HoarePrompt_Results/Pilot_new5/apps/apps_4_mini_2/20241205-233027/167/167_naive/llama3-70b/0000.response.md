To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to check if a sequence of visited cells in a matrix can correspond to valid moves according to the rules defined.

1. **Understanding the Matrix Construction**:
   - The matrix is constructed such that element at position (i, j) contains the value \( A_{i,j} = y(i-1) + j \).
   - Therefore, the number of rows is \( x \) and the number of columns is \( y \) with indices starting from 1.

2. **Movement Validity**:
   - The program must ensure that for any two consecutive values in the input list, the cells they correspond to must be adjacent in the matrix (i.e., the Manhattan distance between the two cells must be exactly 1).

3. **Analysis of the Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates through possible dimensions of the matrix (x and y) and checks if all visited values are within the maximum possible value of the matrix.
   - The function `func_1(x, y)` is implemented to check if the moves correspond to valid adjacent movements in the matrix.

4. **Checking Edge Cases**:
   - One potential edge case is if the input sequence contains numbers that correspond to the same row or the same column but not in a valid movement order.
   - For example, a sequence like `1, 2, 1, 2` should yield `NO` because the moves do not conform to the adjacency requirement even though all values are valid.
   - Another test case might be sending a sequence that skips valid adjacent movements, such as `1, 10`. The expected result should be `YES` for some valid x and y that accommodates the movement, but if not handled properly, this sequence might incorrectly yield `NO`.

### Conclusion
The program does not adequately check for the adjacency of the movements within the logic of choosing x and y. While it attempts to find valid dimensions for the matrix, it may return an incorrect result in cases where visited cells do not adhere to adjacency constraints.

Correctness: **False**. 

An example where the program fails is with the input `6` followed by `1 2 1 2 5 3`, where the expected output should be `NO`, but if the algorithm fails to recognize the non-adjacency of the repeated positions, it may incorrectly claim a valid path exists.
