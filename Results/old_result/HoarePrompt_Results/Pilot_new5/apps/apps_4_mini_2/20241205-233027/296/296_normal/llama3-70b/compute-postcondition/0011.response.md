Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` through user input within the range of 2 to 10^9. It prints 'NO' if `n` is equal to 2. For any value of `n` greater than 2, it prints 'YES', followed by the integer 2, and then prints '1' along with the integer value of `n` divided by 2, and finally prints '1' along with the integer `n`. No values are returned from the function. **
