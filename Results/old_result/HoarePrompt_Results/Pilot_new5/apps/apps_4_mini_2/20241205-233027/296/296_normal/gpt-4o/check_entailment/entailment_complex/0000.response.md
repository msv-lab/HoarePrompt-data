To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements of the problem and the logic followed by the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input**: A positive integer \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).
2. **Output**:
   - Print "YES" if a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) exists such that:
     - \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \).
     - \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \).
     - \( \sum \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).
   - Print "NO" if no such sequence exists.
   - If "YES", also print the number of fractions \( k \) and the fractions themselves.

### Program Logic:
1. The program first checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2. If so, it returns "NO". This is correct as the problem states \( n \) must be at least 2.
2. It finds divisors of \( n \) and stores them in `divisors` list. Only divisors \( b_i \) that are between 1 and \( n \) are considered.
3. If no divisors are found (implying \( n \) is prime), it returns "NO".
4. If divisors are found, it generates fractions of the form \( \frac{1}{d} \) for each divisor \( d \).
5. It counts the number of divisors (non-prime conditions) and returns "YES", followed by the count and the fractions.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- **Divisor Check**: The divisors that are calculated include those between 1 and \( n \) which are not equal to \( n \), meeting the \( 1 < b_i < n \) condition.
- **Fraction Formation**: The fractions generated are of the form \( \frac{1}{d} \), which ensures \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \) since \( a_i = 1 \) and \( b_i = d > 1 \).
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of fractions \( \sum \frac{1}{d} \) might not always equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \) for all divisors, particularly for prime \( n \) which was correctly handled by returning "NO".

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not explicitly check if the sum of the fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). It only returns the fractions created from the divisors. This is a crucial part of the requirement, as the fractions must sum to that specific value.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to ensure that the sum of the generated fractions actually equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \), which is a requirement of the problem. Therefore, while it correctly handles the generation of divisors and basic conditions for output, it does not fulfill the requirement of matching the sum condition.

Correctness: **False**
