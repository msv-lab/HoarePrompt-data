The variable `divisors` is initialized as an empty list. This action does not affect the value of `n`, which continues to be a positive integer between 2 and \(10^9\) and greater than 2. Therefore, the output state is that `divisors` is now an empty list, while `n` retains its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and n is greater than 2; `divisors` is an empty list.**
