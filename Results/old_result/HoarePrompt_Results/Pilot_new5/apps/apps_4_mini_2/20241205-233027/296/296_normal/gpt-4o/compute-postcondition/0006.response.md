The code appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the `divisors` list. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and is divisible by `i`, the initial conditions regarding `n`, `divisors`, and `i` remain valid. The only change occurs in the `divisors` list, which will now contain the value 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and n is greater than 2; `divisors` is a list containing 2; `i` is 2.**
