Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9; `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself) that are less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, including both `i` and `n // i` whenever applicable. `divisors` is not an empty list, meaning `n` is not a prime number.***
