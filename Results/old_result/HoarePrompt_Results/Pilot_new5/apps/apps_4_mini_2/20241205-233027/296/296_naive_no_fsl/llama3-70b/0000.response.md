To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to find fractions \(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\) such that:
  - \(1 < b_i < n\) and \(b_i\) divides \(n\)
  - \(1 \leq a_i < b_i\)
  - The sum of these fractions equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\)

### Program Analysis:
The given program works as follows:
1. It checks if \(n\) is equal to \(2\) and outputs "NO" since there are no valid \(b_i\) satisfying \(1 < b_i < 2\).
2. For any \(n > 2\), it prints "YES", sets \(k = 2\), and then outputs two fractions:
   - The first fraction is \(\frac{1}{n//2}\)
   - The second fraction is \(\frac{1}{n}\)

### Failure Cases:
Now, let's analyze a few cases:
1. **When \( n = 3 \)**:
   - The program will output "YES" and provide the fractions \(\frac{1}{1.5}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\).
   - However, \(b_1 = n // 2 = 1.5\) is not a valid integer, and also \(1 < b_1 < n\) doesn't hold.
   - Thus, it fails to provide a valid fraction as \(b_1\) must be an integer.

2. **When \( n = 4 \)**:
   - The program will output "YES" and provide the fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\).
   - The sum \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) which equals \(1 - \frac{1}{4}\).
   - This case works as expected.

3. **When \( n = 5 \)**:
   - The program will output "YES" and provide the fractions \(\frac{1}{2.5}\) and \(\frac{1}{5}\).
   - Similar to the previous case, \(b_1 = 2.5\) is not valid.

From this, we can conclude that:
- For odd \(n > 2\), the program fails because \(b_i = n // 2\) will yield a non-integer value which does not satisfy the conditions of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails for odd integers greater than \(2\), it does not consistently meet the problem's requirements across all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
