According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition defined by `n`. The loop starts at `i = 2` and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to 2, and since `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and divisible by 2, we know that `n` must be greater than 4 for the divisors list to contain additional elements. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the beginning of the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 3.

Now, we need to ensure that the condition `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))` holds for `i = 3`. Thus, we need to check that `n` is at least 9 (since the square root of 9 is 3).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 3**
