According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n`. The loop will iterate over the range from 2 to the integer value of the square root of `n` plus 1. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, the range will have at least one value (i.e., starting from 2). 

At the end of the loop's last iteration, the value of `i` will be the last integer in the range, which is `int(math.sqrt(n))`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, it must be established that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, which it is, and `i` must start from 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and n is greater than 2, `divisors` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
