Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` must have at least 1 key-value pair, and `count` is the count of the first character in `s`. If `count` is greater than `k`, then `can_distribute` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
