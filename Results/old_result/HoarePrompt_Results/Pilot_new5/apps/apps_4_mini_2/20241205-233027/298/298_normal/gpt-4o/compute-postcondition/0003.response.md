The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. This does not affect any of the defined variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the output state includes the information that the print function has been called.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, and the value of `area` is not an integer; printed 'NO'.**
