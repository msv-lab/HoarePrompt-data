The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. If `b` is 0, the function returns the value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`; in the specific case where `b` is 0, it returns `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, returning `a` when `b` is 0.**
