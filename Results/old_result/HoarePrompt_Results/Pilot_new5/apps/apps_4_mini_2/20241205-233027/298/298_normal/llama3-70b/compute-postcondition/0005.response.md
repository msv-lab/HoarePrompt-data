The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, with the constraint that `b` is non-negative. 

- In Case 1, if the conditions are met, the function returns the values 1 and 0. 
- In Case 2, if `b` is greater than 0, the function returns a tuple containing `y` and `x - a // b * y`, where `x` and `y` are the output of the recursive call `func_2(b, a % b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is non-negative) and return either the values 1 and 0 or a tuple based on the conditions involving `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b` (where `b` is non-negative), returns the values (1, 0) or a tuple based on the values calculated recursively.**
