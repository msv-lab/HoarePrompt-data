To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the problem requirements and the code provided.

### Problem Description:
Vasya needs to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
1. \(0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n\)
2. \(0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m\)
3. The area of the triangle formed by these points is \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

If such points exist, the program must print "YES" and the coordinates; otherwise, it should print "NO".

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Check**:
   ```python
   if n * m % k:
       print('NO')
       exit()
   ```
   This checks if the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) can be an integer by confirming that \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\). If not, it prints "NO" which seems valid.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: Computes the GCD of two numbers, which seems to be correctly implemented as per the description.
   - **`func_2(a, b)`**: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to return coefficients satisfying \(a \cdot x + b \cdot y = \text{gcd}(a, b)\). This appears correct.
   - **`func_3(a, b)`**: Calls `func_2` and returns the tuple along with \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b\). This seems fine too.
   
3. **Triangle Area Check**:
   ```python
   (n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
   if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
       print('YES')
       print(0, 0)
       print(0, n1 * m // g)
       print(m1 * m // g, 0)
   else:
       print('NO')
   ```
   Here, it checks if the area can be formed using the returned \(n1\) and \(m1\) from `func_3`. However, the logic may not guarantee valid coordinates within the specified bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

### Edge Cases:
1. Consider cases where \(n\) and \(m\) are very small (e.g., \(1\)) and \(k\) is very large (e.g., \(2\)). The area \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{1}{2}\) is not possible.
2. The area check does not account for the actual values of \(n1\) and \(m1\) being outside the bounds \(0 \leq x_i \leq n\) and \(0 \leq y_i \leq m\). For example, if \(k\) is chosen such that \(g\) is larger than \(n \cdot m\), the coordinates calculated could fall out of the specified range.
3. The logic does not explicitly handle cases where the GCD is greater than either \(n\) or \(m\), since the area must fit within those bounds.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the generated coordinates will always satisfy the triangle area condition under the given bounds, especially in edge cases where \(n\) and \(m\) are constrained. Additionally, the area being equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\) does not ensure three distinct points forming a valid triangle.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program has potential cases where it can incorrectly assert the existence of triangle points due to bounds or integer division issues, specifically when \(k\) is not properly accounted for against the values of \(n\) and \(m\).
