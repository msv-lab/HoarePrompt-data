The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, where `a` represents the variable 'n' and `b` represents the variable 'm' from the problem description. The function returns the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`, where `x` and `y` are values derived from calling the function `func_2(a, b)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and return the computed result of the expression involving those parameters based on the values returned by the function `func_2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the result of the expression x * a + y * b, where x and y are obtained from func_2(a, b).**
