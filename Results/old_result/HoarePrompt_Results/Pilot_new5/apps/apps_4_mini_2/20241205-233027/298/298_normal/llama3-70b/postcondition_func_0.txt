The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, calculated using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is initially 0, it will return `a`, which is correct since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. The function handles any positive integers, and there are no missing edge cases in the logic provided.
