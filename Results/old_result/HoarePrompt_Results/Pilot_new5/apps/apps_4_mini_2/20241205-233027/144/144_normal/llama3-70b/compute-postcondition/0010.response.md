Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `mex` is 1, and `num` is not equal to 1. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
