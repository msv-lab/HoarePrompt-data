According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, the list `arr` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, we know `a` has at least `n` elements, but there is no direct link to `arr`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty.

At the end of the last iteration, `mex` is initialized to 1. For the loop to be executed, the state must ensure that `arr` is not empty.

State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `arr` must be a non-empty sorted list of integers, `mex` is 1**
