The variable `mex` is assigned the value `1`. There are no changes to the other variables, and their states remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a sorted list of integers; `mex` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a sorted list of integers; `mex` is 1**.
