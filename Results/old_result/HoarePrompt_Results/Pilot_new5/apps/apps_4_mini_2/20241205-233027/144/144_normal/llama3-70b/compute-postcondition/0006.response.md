The value of `mex` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `mex` is now 2, and the current value of `num` remains equal to `mex` (2).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers; `mex` is 2; `num` is equal to `mex` (2).**
