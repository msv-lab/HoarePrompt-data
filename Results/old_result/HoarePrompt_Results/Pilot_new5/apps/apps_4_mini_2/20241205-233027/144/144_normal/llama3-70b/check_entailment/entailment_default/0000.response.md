To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its functionality step by step.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to determine the maximum possible value of `mex` of an array after performing some operations. The `mex` of an array is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the array.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    mex = 1
    for num in arr:
        if num == mex:
            mex += 1
        elif num > mex:
            break
    print(mex)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` integers into an array `arr`.
2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted.
3. **Mex Calculation**:
   - A variable `mex` is initialized to `1`.
   - The code iterates through the sorted array:
     - If the current number `num` is equal to `mex`, it increments `mex`.
     - If `num` exceeds `mex`, it breaks out of the loop, as any subsequent numbers (being sorted) will also exceed `mex`.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the computed `mex`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function determines the smallest positive integer not present in the list and prints this value.

### Evaluation:
1. **Correct Functionality**:
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the `mex` for a sorted array, as it will find the smallest integer missing from the array by checking if each integer starting from `1` is present.
   - The functionality of incrementing `mex` when it finds an equivalent number and breaking when it finds a larger number is sound.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all numbers in the array are greater than `n` (e.g., `[5, 6, 7]` when `n = 3`), the output should be `1`, which is correctly handled.
   - If the input contains duplicates or gaps (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1]` should yield `2`), the program handles this correctly by continuously incrementing `mex`.
   - The edge case of having `n = 1` is also handled correctly.

Upon considering these scenarios, we observe that:
- The program does indeed cover all potential cases as described in the problem.
- There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle based on the description.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing both the code and the output hints, they are in agreement, and the code successfully meets the requirements of the problem description. It appears to correctly compute the maximum possible value of `mex` for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
