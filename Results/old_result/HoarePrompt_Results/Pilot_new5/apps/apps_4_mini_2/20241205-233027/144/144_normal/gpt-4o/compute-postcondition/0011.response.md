According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the second element in the sorted list `a`, and `mex` may have been increased by 1 if `num` is greater than or equal to the current value of `mex`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it requires that `a` contains at least 3 elements, since `num` is currently the second element. Hence, assuming the list has at least 3 elements, the next iteration will set `num` to the third element of the list `a`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `mex` is unchanged (assuming `num` was less than `mex`), `num` becomes the third element in the list, and `a` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order and must have at least 3 elements; `num` is the third element in `a`; `mex` remains unchanged**
