According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the last element processed from `arr`, which is in a non-empty sorted list.

Since `num` is the last element of the sorted list `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to examine how the loop increments. However, since `arr` is sorted and non-empty, we can determine that there is always a next element unless we've reached the end of the list.

The key points are:
- `n` remains unchanged because it purely defines the size of the list `a`.
- `arr` is non-empty and contains at least one integer.
- `num` will take on the next integer from `arr` for every iteration.
- Since the loop iterates over `arr`, if `num` is the last element in `arr`, then the loop would not execute again.

However, if we want to consider the state at the end of the last iteration where `num` is still within the bounds of `arr`, we can look at `num`, which must be less than or equal to the maximum integer in `arr`.

To summarize, if `num` is the last element, and for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least one more integer following `num`. Therefore, `num` must represent the next integer in the sorted list that is greater than the previous `num`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers that must have at least one more element than the current `num`, and `num` must be the next integer in the sorted list `arr`.**
