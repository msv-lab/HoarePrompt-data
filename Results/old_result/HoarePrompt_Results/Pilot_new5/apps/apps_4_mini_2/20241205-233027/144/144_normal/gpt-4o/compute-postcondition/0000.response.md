The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer input from the user. Given that `n` was previously defined as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, this input will determine the new value of `n`. The list `a` remains unchanged in this context as the code provided does not affect it. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is now equal to the integer input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9.**
