To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles the input and its logic to determine the maximum possible value of mex after applying the allowed operations.

The program reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` positive integers. It sorts the array and initializes `mex` to 1. Then, it iterates through the sorted array and checks if the current number is greater than or equal to `mex`. If so, it increments `mex` by 1.

### The issues with the code:

1. **Handling of duplicates**: The program does not correctly account for duplicate values in the array. If there are multiple occurrences of a value greater than or equal to `mex`, the program will increment `mex` multiple times redundantly for each duplicate occurrence. This does not reflect the correct calculation of mex, since we only need to account for unique smaller values.

2. **Case with fewer unique values**: For example, consider the input `3` and the array `3, 3, 3`. The expected mex here should be `1`, since we cannot create `1` from the array. The program would incorrectly determine `mex` as `4`, since it would increment `mex` for every comparison (3 >= 1, 3 >= 2, 3 >= 3).

3. **Output**: The situation where `a` contains no values less than `n` also needs to be handled properly, which might not be accurately reflected in the current logic.

### Example case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
3 3 3
```
Expected Output: `1`  
Actual Output: `4`

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the program does not satisfy all conditions outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
