The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `mex` is 1, `num` is not equal to 1, and the current value of `num` is greater than `mex`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
