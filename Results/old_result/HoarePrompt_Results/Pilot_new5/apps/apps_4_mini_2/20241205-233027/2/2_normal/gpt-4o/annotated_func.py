#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the positive integer n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 10^18) and calculates the sum of its digits, returning that sum. It handles the entire range of valid positive integers correctly, and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases since `n` is guaranteed to be within the specified bounds.
