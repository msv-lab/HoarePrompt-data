The value of `max_num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new state of the affected variable `max_num` is now 2.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2**
