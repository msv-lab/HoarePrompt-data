Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input where each element `x_i` satisfies 0 <= `x_i` <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input; `total_x` is the sum of the elements in `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the elements in `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, if `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, then 'Yes' is printed.***
