The code snippet assigns the value of `y` to a new list created by mapping the result of converting each element from the input into an integer. The initial state states that `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers. After executing the code, `y` will be updated to reflect the new list derived from the input, which is a list of `n` non-negative integers satisfying the given condition. The length of the list remains `n`, but the specific values in the list can change based on the input. The other variables (`n` and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input where each element x_i satisfies 0 <= x_i <= 1000; `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers derived from input where each element y_i is an input integer.**
