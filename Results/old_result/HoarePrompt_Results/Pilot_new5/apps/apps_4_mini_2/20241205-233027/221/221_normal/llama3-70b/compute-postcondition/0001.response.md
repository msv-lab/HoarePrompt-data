The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The values of `s` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input positive integer between 2 and 10^12; `x` is an input positive integer between 0 and 10^12; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is an input positive integer between 2 and 10^12; `x` is an input positive integer between 0 and 10^12; `count` is 0**.
