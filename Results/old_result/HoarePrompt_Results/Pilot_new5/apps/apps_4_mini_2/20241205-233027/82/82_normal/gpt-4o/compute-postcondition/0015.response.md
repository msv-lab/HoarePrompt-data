Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, and `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b). If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` with `candidate` being less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, and `k` is set to 1, while `candidate` iterates over [1, diff].***
