Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` calculated for each candidate, `min_k` is the candidate that provided this minimum value, `k` is `current_k + 1`, and `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.**
