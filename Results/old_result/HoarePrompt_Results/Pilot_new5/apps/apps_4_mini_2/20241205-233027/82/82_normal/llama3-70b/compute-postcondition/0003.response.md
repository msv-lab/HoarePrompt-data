The statement `a, b = b, a % b` is a tuple assignment, where `a` takes the value of `b` and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. Given that `b` is initially greater than 0 and `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, we can determine the new values for `a` and `b`.

1. `a` becomes equal to the original value of `b`.
2. `b` becomes equal to `a % b`. Since `b` was originally `a % b`, we can denote `a` as its original value, let's call it `orig_a`, and since `b` is equal to `orig_a % b`, it will always be less than `orig_a` and greater than 0.

Thus, after the execution:
- `a` will be equal to the original value of `b`.
- `b` will be `orig_a % orig_b`, which is less than the original value of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to `a % b` (which is less than the original value of `b` and greater than 0).**
