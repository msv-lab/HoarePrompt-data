The variable `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, where `new_a` is equal to `a` and `new_b` is equal to `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are both positive integers, while `new_a` and `new_b` retain those values. The `current_lcm` now represents the least common multiple of `a` and `b`, as calculated by the function `func_2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(a, b)`, `k` is 1, `candidate` is 1, `new_a` is equal to `a`, `new_b` is equal to `b`.**
