To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the pre-existing conditions and the operation being performed.

1. The initial state provides a context: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `diff` is at least 2. 
2. The variable `new_b` has already been defined as the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
3. The function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` is called, and it presumably calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b` and assigns it to `current_lcm`.

Since `current_lcm` is being assigned the value from the function `func_2`, the relevant values affecting the output state could be the current values of `new_a` and `new_b`.

The output state will reflect the assignment of `current_lcm`, but since we do not have the result from `func_2`, we denote it simply as a function call that impacts the state.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `2` or `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_k` is the candidate that provided this minimum value, `current_k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) - 1`, `k` is `current_k + 1` which must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) , `current_lcm` is now the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
