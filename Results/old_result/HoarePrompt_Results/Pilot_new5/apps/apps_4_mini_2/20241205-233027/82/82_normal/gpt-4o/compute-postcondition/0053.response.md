The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer; `diff` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `candidate` is 2; `new_a` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `b`; `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b); `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer; `diff` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `candidate` is 2; `new_a` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `b`; `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b); `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is 2.**
