Let's analyze the provided code and descriptions.

The problem requires us to find a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized, and if there are multiple values of \( k \) that give the same minimum LCM, we need to choose the smallest such \( k \).

### Analyzing the Code

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( a \) and \( b \) using the Euclidean algorithm. The implementation seems correct as it handles the input constraints effectively.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**: This function calculates the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) using the relation:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
   The implementation appears correct, as long as both \( a \) and \( b \) are positive, which they are given the constraints.

3. **Main Logic**: The code initializes \( k = 0 \) and computes the initial minimum LCM using `func_2(a, b)`. It then enters a loop, incrementing \( k \) until it finds a \( k \) for which the LCM does not decrease. 

### Identifying Edge Cases

- The output description notes that if `func_1(a, b)` returns 0, this leads to a division by zero in `func_2`. However, given the constraints (1 ≤ \( a, b \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)), `func_1(a, b)` will never return 0 because both input values are positive. Therefore, this scenario is indeed not possible with the given constraints.

### Output Hints Review

The output hints suggest that the first function correctly calculates the GCD, and the second function correctly calculates the LCM based on the GCD. There is also mention of a potential division by zero, but this does not apply given the constraints.

### Conclusion

Considering the above analysis, the code successfully meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly computes the minimum \( k \) such that LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized without any risk of encountering undefined behavior (like division by zero) due to the constraints.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) that minimizes the LCM for the given constraints, and there are no edge cases that would cause it to fail based on the inputs.
