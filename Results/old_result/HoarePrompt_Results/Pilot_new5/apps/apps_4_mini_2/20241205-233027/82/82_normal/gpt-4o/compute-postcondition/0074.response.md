To calculate the value of `new_a`, we use the formula provided in the code snippet. The value of `candidate` is already defined as `diff // k`, and since `a` is a positive integer, we can compute `new_a`.

The formula is:
```
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

1. We add `candidate` to `a` and subtract `1`, then perform an integer division by `candidate`, and finally multiply the result by `candidate` to get the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

Since the values of `b`, `diff`, `candidate`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` remain unchanged, the output will reflect the updated value of `new_a` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `new_a` is updated to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
