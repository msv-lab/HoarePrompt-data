According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the candidates in the list `[k, diff // k]`. The loop iterates over the values of `candidate`, and it will execute twice because there are two elements in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`. For the loop to be executed one more time, the first iteration will set `candidate` to `k`, and the next iteration will set `candidate` to `diff // k`.

Since `k` is 1, and `candidate` is `diff`, after the last iteration, `candidate` will be `diff // 1`, which is `diff`. However, for the loop to continue and execute for the second time, `candidate` must be updated to be `diff // k` where `k` is 1. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- In the first iteration, `candidate` takes the value of `k`, which is 1, and it will take the next value `diff // k` in the second iteration.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `k` is 1, and `candidate` is `k` (which is 1)**.
