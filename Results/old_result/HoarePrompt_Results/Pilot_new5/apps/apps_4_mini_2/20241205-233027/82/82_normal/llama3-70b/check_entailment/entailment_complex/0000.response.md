The provided code aims to solve the problem of finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. 

To evaluate the correctness of the code, let's break down its components:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( a \) and \( b \) using the Euclidean algorithm. It correctly handles positive integers and satisfies the condition \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9 \).

2. **Function 2: `func_2(a, b)`**
   - This function calculates the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) using the relationship:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
     \]
   - However, as noted in the annotations, if the GCD is zero, it will lead to a division by zero error. Yet, given the constraints \( 1 \leq a, b \), this scenario is not possible.

3. **Main Logic**
   - The program initializes \( k = 0 \) and finds the initial LCM using `func_2(a, b)`.
   - It then enters a loop, incrementing \( k \) and checking whether the LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is less than the previously recorded minimum LCM.
   - If a smaller LCM is found, it updates the minimum and continues. If no smaller LCM is found, it breaks out of the loop and prints \( k - 1 \).

### Key Considerations:
- The program checks for increasing values of \( k \) until it finds an instance where the LCM is no longer decreasing. This may potentially miss the smallest \( k \) that yields the minimum LCM if that point occurs after some non-incrementing results.
- The loop continues indefinitely until it finds a point where the LCM does not decrease, which could lead to an infinite loop under certain conditions.

### Example Cases:
1. For input \( (6, 10) \):
   - \( k = 0 \): LCM(6, 10) = 30
   - \( k = 1 \): LCM(7, 11) = 77
   - \( k = 2 \): LCM(8, 12) = 24 (min found)
   - Further increments will lead to values higher than 24.
   - Correct output is \( 2 \).

2. For input \( (21, 31) \):
   - The correct output is found to be \( 9 \).

3. However, for input \( (1, 1) \):
   - The code will evaluate:
     - \( k = 0 \): LCM(1, 1) = 1
     - \( k = 1 \): LCM(2, 2) = 2
     - The loop should terminate since LCM does not decrease anymore, returning \( 0 \), which is correct based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle cases correctly where the optimal \( k \) might be missed if the loop condition does not find a smaller LCM before stopping. Specifically, it can miss optimal values because it breaks out immediately after finding LCMs that do not decrease, rather than evaluating all potential values of \( k \).

Correctness: **False**

The program does not guarantee to find the smallest \( k \) for every input case, particularly when the optimal \( k \) occurs after a series of non-decreasing LCM values.
