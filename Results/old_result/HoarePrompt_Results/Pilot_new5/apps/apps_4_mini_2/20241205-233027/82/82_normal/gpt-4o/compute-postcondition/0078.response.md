The code assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. Since `candidate` is defined as `diff // k`, `min_k` now holds that same value. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `min_k` while maintaining the rest of the initial conditions.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
