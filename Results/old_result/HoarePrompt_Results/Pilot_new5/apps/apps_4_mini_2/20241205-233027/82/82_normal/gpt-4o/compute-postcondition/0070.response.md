Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `candidate` must be either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is either `candidate` or remains unchanged, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
