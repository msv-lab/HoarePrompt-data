The code updates the value of `new_b` based on the given formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The variables `b` and `candidate` are both positive integers, so we can substitute their values. The calculation for `new_b` will yield a value that is the nearest multiple of `candidate` (which is 2) that is greater than or equal to `b`. 

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is 2, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of 2 greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b).**
