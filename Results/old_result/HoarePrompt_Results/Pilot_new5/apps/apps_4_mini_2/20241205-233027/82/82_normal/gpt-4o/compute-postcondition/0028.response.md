The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables, and updates the value of `min_k`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `current_lcm` is the resulting value of `func_2(a, b)`; `k` is 1; `candidate` is 1; `new_a` is equal to `a`; `new_b` is equal to `b`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is 1.**
