To determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the problem of finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized, we need to analyze the code and its annotations thoroughly.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Function func_1**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The implementation is correct, and the function returns the GCD of the input values, handling cases where one of the inputs is zero.

2. **Function func_2**: This function computes the LCM using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \). The function assumes that both \( x \) and \( y \) are greater than 0, which is valid since \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers.

3. **Function func_3**: This is the main function that implements the logic necessary to find the smallest \( k \):
   - If \( a \) is equal to \( b \), it returns \( 0 \) immediately, which is correct since the LCM of two equal numbers is that number itself.
   - It calculates the absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \).
   - It iterates through all divisors of \( \text{diff} \) to find candidates for \( k \). For each candidate, it calculates the adjusted values \( \text{new_a} \) and \( \text{new_b} \) and computes their LCM.
   - Finally, it returns the candidate \( k \) that results in the smallest LCM.

### Potential Issues:
- The loop iterates over factors of \( \text{diff} \) up to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \). While this is efficient, we must consider whether iterating only up to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \) captures all necessary candidates. The code does find both \( k \) and \( \frac{\text{diff}}{k} \), which is a good strategy to ensure that candidates cover all divisors, but it does not explicitly check for all possible non-negative integers \( k \) that could yield a smaller LCM in some cases.
- There might be edge cases, particularly when \( a \) and \( b \) are very large and close, potentially leading to missed candidates between the factors.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1**: \( a = 6, b = 10 \)
  - The expected output is \( 2 \). The function checks factors of \( 4 \) (the difference), leading to candidates \( 1 \) and \( 4 \), and indeed returns \( 2 \) as the minimal \( k \).

- **Case 2**: \( a = 21, b = 31 \)
  - The expected output is \( 9 \). The difference is \( 10 \), and the function finds the LCM correctly.

- **Case 3**: \( a = 5, b = 10 \)
  - The expected output is \( 0 \). The function handles this case correctly as well.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle the requirements properly for the provided examples and does not seem to miss any significant edge cases based on the provided annotations. However, without exhaustive testing of every possible potential value of \( k \) against the expected minimum LCM, we cannot be certain.

Therefore, while the code works for the provided examples, the potential for missing cases when adjusting based on the divisors of \( \text{diff} \) suggests that it may not be fully comprehensive.

Given this analysis, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**

**Explanation**: The program may not find all potential candidates \( k \) for minimizing the LCM due to its reliance solely on the factors of \( |a - b| \). This could lead to situations where a smaller \( k \) exists outside of the divisor candidates, especially in edge cases where \( a \) and \( b \) are very close but not equal.
