The variable `min_k` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is float('inf'), and `min_k` is `0`.
