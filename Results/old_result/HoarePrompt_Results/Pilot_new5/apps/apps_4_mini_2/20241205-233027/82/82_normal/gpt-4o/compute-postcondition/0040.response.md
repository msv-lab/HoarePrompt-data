Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` can be either `2` or `diff // 2`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` with `candidate` being less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`.***
