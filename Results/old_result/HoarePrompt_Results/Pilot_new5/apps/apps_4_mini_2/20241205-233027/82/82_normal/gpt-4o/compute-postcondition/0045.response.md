The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the other variables retain their previous states. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b), `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
