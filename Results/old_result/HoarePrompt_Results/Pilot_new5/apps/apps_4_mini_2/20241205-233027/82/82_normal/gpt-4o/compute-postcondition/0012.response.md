Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is float('inf'), `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `candidate` iterates over [1, diff], `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and the current value of `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b). The current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
