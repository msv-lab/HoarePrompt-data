The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, constrained such that \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9 \). 

- In Case 1, if `a` and `b` are equal positive integers, the function returns `0`.
- In Case 2, if the loop executes, the function returns `min_k`, which is the candidate that provided the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`. If the loop did not execute, the function returns `0`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and return `0` if they are equal. If they are not equal, it returns the minimum least common multiple candidate from the loop execution or `0` if the loop did not execute. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, returns `0` if `a` and `b` are equal; otherwise, it returns the candidate that provided the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` if the loop executed, or `0` if the loop did not execute.**
