According to the code, the loop iterates over the values `k` and `diff // k`. The variable `candidate` takes on these values sequentially. The loop can execute one more time if there are more values for `candidate` to take from the list `[k, diff // k]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`. If `candidate` is `k`, then the next value for `candidate` will be `diff // k`. If it is `diff // k`, then the loop will not execute again, unless there are additional candidates to process in a wider context (like if `k` can be updated).

Since the problem states that `k` is set to 1 and `candidate` iterates over the list `[1, diff]`, it suggests that the loop will only execute with these two candidates if `diff` is greater than 1.

Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` must be at least 1, so `diff // k` (which equals `diff` since `k` is 1) should be the second value taken when the loop iterates.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b), `k` is 1, candidate is `diff`, and candidate must iterate over [1, diff].**
