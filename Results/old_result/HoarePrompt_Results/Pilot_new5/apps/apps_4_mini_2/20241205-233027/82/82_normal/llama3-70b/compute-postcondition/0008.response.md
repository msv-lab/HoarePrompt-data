The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers with constraints that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` when `b` is zero.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor of a and b when b is zero.**
