The variable `normalized_angle` is assigned the value of `x % 360`, which normalizes the angle to be within the range of 0 to 359 degrees. Then, `turns` is calculated as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, which determines how many 90-degree turns are needed to reach a full circle from the normalized angle. 

Since `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`, we can substitute this into the calculation for `turns`. Therefore, `turns` will be determined based on the value of `normalized_angle`.

The output state will remain with the information about the input integer `x` and will include the calculated value of `turns`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer representing the camera angle in degrees; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`; `turns` is equal to (360 - (x % 360)) // 90 % 4.**
