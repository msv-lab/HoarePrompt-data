The value of `normalized_angle` is assigned the result of `x % 360`. The variable `x` is an input integer representing the camera angle in degrees, so `normalized_angle` will be the remainder when `x` is divided by 360. This means `normalized_angle` will be in the range of 0 to 359, inclusive. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer representing the camera angle in degrees; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`.**
