The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for an integer input `x`, which is then constrained to the range [0, 359] by taking `x % 360`. It prints 0 if `x` is 0; otherwise, it prints an integer from the set {1, 2, 3} based on the value of `x`. The printout value corresponds to the sector in a circle divided into four quadrants (90-degree segments). If the input is negative, it effectively reduces the input into the positive equivalent within the range of 0 to 359, but does not handle cases where `x` is directly outside the specified range.
