To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze how it handles the input based on the problem description.

The problem requires calculating the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to correct the image rotation caused by the camera's angle. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the program:
1. It reads an integer input `x`, which represents the rotation angle.
2. It normalizes this angle using `x % 360`, which ensures that the angle is within the range of 0 to 359 degrees.
3. It calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed using the formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. 

### Potential Issues:
- The normalization step (`x % 360`) will yield values between -359 and 359, but the program then only works with the positive outcomes.
- When `normalized_angle` is negative (which happens when `x` is a negative value), the formula `(360 - normalized_angle)` can lead to incorrect calculations since the formula assumes that the angle is positive.

### Example Cases:
1. **Input: `60`**:
   - Normalized angle = `60`
   - Required turns = `(360 - 60) // 90 % 4` = `300 // 90 % 4` = `3`
   - Expected output = `1`, but the program would output `3`.

2. **Input: `-60`**:
   - Normalized angle = `300` (as `-60 % 360` = `300`)
   - Required turns = `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4` = `60 // 90 % 4` = `0`
   - Expected output = `3`, but the program would output `0`.

In both cases, the calculations lead to incorrect outputs compared to the expected results mentioned in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not provide the correct output for at least one input case (and indeed fails for multiple cases), the correctness of the program is deemed **False**.

Correctness: **False**.
