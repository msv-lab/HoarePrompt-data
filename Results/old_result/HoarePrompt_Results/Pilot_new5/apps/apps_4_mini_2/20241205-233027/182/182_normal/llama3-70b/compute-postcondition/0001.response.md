The value of `x` is updated to be `x % 360`. The range for `x` is from -10^18 to 10^18, so after applying the modulo operation, `x` will be transformed into a value that falls within the range of 0 to 359 (inclusive) if `x` is non-negative, and will be transformed to a value within the range of -359 to 0 (exclusive) if `x` is negative. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is equal to `x % 360`, where `x` is now a value between 0 and 359 if the original `x` was non-negative, or between -359 and 0 if the original `x` was negative.**
