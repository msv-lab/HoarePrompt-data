The value of `digit` is the first character of `ticket`, which is a string of digits. Since `digit` is a character, it needs to be converted to an integer before being added to `curr_sum`. The `curr_sum` is updated to include this value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length at least 2, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is `curr_sum + int(digit)`, `segments` is 0, `digit` is the first character of `ticket`**.
