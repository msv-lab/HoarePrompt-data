The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` was incremented by 1 before the code execution, so now `segment_count` increases to the next integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is incremented by 2, `i` is 2.**
