The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `int(ticket[2])`, but now it has been reset to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is updated to 2, `i` is 2.**
