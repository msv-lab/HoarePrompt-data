The value of `current_sum` is updated by adding `int(ticket[i])` to it. The value of `i` is 2, so `ticket[i]` refers to the third digit of the string `ticket`, which is a digit character. The value of `current_sum` will therefore be incremented by the integer value of that character. Other variables remain unchanged in their values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is `current_sum + int(ticket[2])`, `segment_count` is 2, `segment_length` is `n - 1`, `target_sum` is still `segment_sum(0, n - 2)`, `i` is 2**
