Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the digits may sum up to the same total but cannot be divided into segments that are non-intersecting. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
11111
```
In this case, the sum of all the digits is 5. The segments could be formed as `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, leading to equal sums of 1, but they do not satisfy the requirement of forming non-intersecting segments with the same sum greater than one. The maximum valid segment sum would only yield one segment.

Another problematic case is:
```
6
123456
```
The digits sum to 21, and while you could create two segments that sum up to 7 (for example, `1+2+4` and `3+4`), the program's logic of looking for "target_sum" in segments fails to find this division correctly.

The current implementation incorrectly asserts a ticket as lucky when it should not, which contradicts the problem's requirements. Therefore, it does not handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results for these inputs.
