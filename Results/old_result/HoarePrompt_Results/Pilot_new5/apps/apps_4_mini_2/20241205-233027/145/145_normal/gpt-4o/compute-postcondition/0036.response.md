The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `current_sum + int(ticket[1])`, but since `current_sum` is being reset to `0`, the previous calculation does not affect the new value. Therefore, `current_sum` is now `0`. The other variables `n`, `ticket`, `segment_count`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is updated to 1, `i` is 1**
