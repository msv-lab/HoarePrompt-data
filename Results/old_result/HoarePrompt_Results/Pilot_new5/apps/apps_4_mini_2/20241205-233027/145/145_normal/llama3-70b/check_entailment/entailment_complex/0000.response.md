The program verifies whether a given sequence of digits can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums, which aligns with the problem description.

Here's the breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` (the number of digits) and a sequence of digits, converting them into a list of integers. This matches the problem description's requirements.

2. **Total Sum Check**: The function `func_1` first calculates the total sum of the digits. It checks if this sum is even. If it is odd, the function returns `False`, indicating that it is impossible to split an odd total sum into two equal parts. This is correct as per the requirements; a lucky ticket necessitates an even sum.

3. **Finding Segments**: If the total sum is even, it calculates the target sum (half of the total sum) and initializes a `curr_sum` to accumulate segment sums. It iterates over the digits, adding to `curr_sum`. When `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, it resets `curr_sum` to start a new segment and increments the segment count.

4. **Segment Count Check**: Finally, the program checks if the number of segments formed is greater than or equal to 2. If yes, it returns `True`, indicating that the ticket is lucky; otherwise, it returns `False`.

5. **Return Values**: The program outputs "YES" if there are at least two segments with equal sums and "NO" otherwise, which adheres to the expected output format of the problem.

The only aspect to note is that while the function assumes the input will always be valid digits (0-9), the problem constraints guarantee that input will be within this range. Therefore, the function does not need to handle invalid characters or non-numeric inputs.

In conclusion, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, ensuring that it correctly identifies lucky tickets based on the defined criteria.

Correctness: **True**
