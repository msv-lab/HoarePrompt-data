Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is updated to 3, `segment_length` remains `n - 1`, and `target_sum` is still `segment_sum(0, n - 2)`, with `i` being 2.***
