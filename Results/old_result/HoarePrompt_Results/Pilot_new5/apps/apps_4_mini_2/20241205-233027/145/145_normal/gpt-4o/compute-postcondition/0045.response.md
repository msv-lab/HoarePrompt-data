Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits, `current_sum` is the sum of the last segment of digits not matching `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`. The current value of `current_sum` is 0 and the current value of `segment_count` is greater than 1.***
