Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully comply with the requirements outlined in the problem description due to the lack of validation for digit values in the function `func_1`. The program assumes that the input digits will always be valid (i.e., non-negative and less than the specified base). However, the problem description explicitly states that the digits must satisfy the condition \(0 \leq x_i < b_x\) for X and \(0 \leq y_i < b_y\) for Y. 

Here are the issues identified:

1. **No Input Validation**: The program does not check if the digits for X and Y fall within the valid range as specified in the problem description. If the input contains any digit that is not less than the base or is negative, it will lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.

2. **Potential Runtime Errors**: If the program receives input that includes invalid digits (for example, if a digit is equal to or greater than the base), then the conversion to decimal using `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit` will produce an incorrect output, leading to comparison errors.

3. **Assumption of Validity**: The program assumes that the input format will always be adhered to without validating against the constraints provided in the problem description.

Due to these issues, the program does not handle all potential edge cases as required, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
