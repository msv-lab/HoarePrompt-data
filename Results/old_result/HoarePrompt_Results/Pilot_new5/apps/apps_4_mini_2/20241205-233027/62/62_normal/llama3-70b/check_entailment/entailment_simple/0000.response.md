Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Let's break down how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two space-separated integers `n` and `b_x` from the first line, which represent the number of digits and the base for the first number `X`.
   - It then reads the `n` digits of `X` from the next line.
   - Similarly, it reads `m` and `b_y` for the second number `Y` and then reads the `m` digits of `Y`.

2. **Conversion of Numbers**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of digits and a base as input and converts the number represented by those digits in the specified base to its decimal equivalent.
   - The conversion algorithm correctly computes the decimal value using the formula: `result = result * base + digit`, which follows the positional value of digits in any base system.

3. **Comparison Logic**: 
   - After converting both numbers to their decimal representations (`x` and `y`), the program compares them using standard comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `=`) and prints the corresponding result as described in the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program adheres to the constraints provided (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 and 2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40) and ensures that digits range from 0 to their respective base minus one. There are no leading zeros in input, and both numbers are positive, adhering to the problem constraints.

5. **Output Format**: 
   - The output is a single character (`<`, `>`, or `=`) as required, fulfilling the output specifications.

Overall, the logic for reading inputs, converting numbers from different bases, comparing them, and outputting results is correctly implemented according to the problem description. Hence, the program is indeed correct.
