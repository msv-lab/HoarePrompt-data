To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program is intended to compare two numbers represented in different bases (base `b_x` for X, and base `b_y` for Y). It should output:
- `<` if X < Y
- `>` if X > Y
- `=` if X = Y

### Code Analysis:
1. The first part of the code reads the input for two numbers in different bases.
2. The function `func_1` takes the digits of a number and its base, converting it to its decimal equivalent.
3. Finally, it compares the two decimal values and prints the appropriate comparison symbol.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
1. **Invalid Digits**: The function `func_1` does not check if any digits are outside the valid range for their respective bases (i.e., it doesn't check if `digit >= base`). If an invalid digit is present, it could lead to incorrect results or even runtime errors.
2. **Base Constraints**: Although the input guarantees that bases are between 2 and 40, the function doesn't explicitly handle negative or unexpected input values.
3. **Leading Zeros**: The problem states there will be no leading zeros, so we need to trust the input adheres to this, but it's worth mentioning as it could affect the interpretation of the numbers if it were not enforced.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the `func_1` function does not handle cases where digits are outside the valid range, which agrees with our analysis.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not handle invalid digits in the `func_1` function, it can lead to incorrect behavior if such cases are ever encountered, even though the problem description states that inputs will follow the defined constraints.

Thus, we conclude that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
The program doesn't check for invalid digit values against their respective bases in the `func_1` function, which could lead to incorrect results if invalid input were provided. This means the program does not guarantee correct behavior under all potential inputs as required by the problem description.
