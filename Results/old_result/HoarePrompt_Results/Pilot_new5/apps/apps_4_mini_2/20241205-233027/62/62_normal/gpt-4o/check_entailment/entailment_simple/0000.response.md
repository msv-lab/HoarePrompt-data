Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements for all potential cases:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input format specified in the problem description. It captures the bases and digits for both numbers X and Y.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` is responsible for converting a number from its base representation to its decimal equivalent. It does this by iterating through the digits and accumulating the decimal value based on the base provided. The algorithm used (multiplying by the base and adding the current digit) is the standard method for converting a number from an arbitrary base to decimal. This ensures that the conversion is accurate for any valid input within the specified constraints.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers to their decimal representations, the program compares them using standard relational operators (`<`, `>`, `=`). This comparison directly aligns with the problem requirements, which demand that the program outputs the relationship between the two numbers in terms of their equality or inequality.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases specified in the problem (e.g., minimum and maximum values of n and m, valid ranges for bases, and the absence of leading zeroes). Since the problem guarantees no leading zeroes and positive numbers, there's no need for additional validation in the program logic.

5. **Output Format**: The outputs are formatted correctly as specified in the problem description, using single characters '<', '>', or '=' to represent the comparison results.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem's requirements, ensuring that it functions correctly across all specified input cases.
