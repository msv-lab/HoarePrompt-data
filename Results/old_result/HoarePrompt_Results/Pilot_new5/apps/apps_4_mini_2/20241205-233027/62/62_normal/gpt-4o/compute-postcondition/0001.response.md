According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, the `digits` list must contain at least one element. Additionally, the loop variable `digit` will take on the values from the list during each iteration.

At the start of the loop, the initial value of `decimal_value` does not affect whether the loop can execute. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows: the `digits` list must have at least 1 digit, and `digit` will be the first element of the `digits` list during the first iteration.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, `decimal_value` is 0, `digit` is the first element of the `digits` list**
