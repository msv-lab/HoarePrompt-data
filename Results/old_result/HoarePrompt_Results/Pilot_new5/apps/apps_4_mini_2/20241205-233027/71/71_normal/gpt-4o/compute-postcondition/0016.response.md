Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty. If the second-to-last character `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is either 2 or 1, and `to_remove` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0, `to_remove` is either 1 or 2, and `digit` remains the second-to-last character in `n`.***
