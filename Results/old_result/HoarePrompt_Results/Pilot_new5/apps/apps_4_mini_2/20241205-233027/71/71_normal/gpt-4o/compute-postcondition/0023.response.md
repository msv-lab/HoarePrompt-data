The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state retains the condition of the variables involved in that if statement.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty, `count_zeros` is `k + 1` if `digit` is '0', otherwise `count_zeros` equals `k`, `to_remove` retains its value if `digit` is '0' or is incremented by 1 otherwise, and `digit` is the next digit in the reversed string of `n`.**
