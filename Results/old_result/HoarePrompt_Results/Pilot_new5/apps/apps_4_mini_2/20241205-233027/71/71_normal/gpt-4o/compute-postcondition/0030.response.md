Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then `to_remove` is 0. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits found in the last `k` digits of `n`, which is less than `k`; the output of the print statement is the length of `n` minus 1.***
