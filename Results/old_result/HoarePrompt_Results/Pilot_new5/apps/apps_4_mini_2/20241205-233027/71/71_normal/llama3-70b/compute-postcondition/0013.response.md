The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, based on the provided constraints, it is expected to operate with specific non-negative integers for `n` and positive integers for `k`. However, without the output details, we cannot specify the return value or behavior of the function. Therefore, since the output details are not provided, we cannot define the functionality accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. The behavior and return value are not specified due to lack of output details.**
