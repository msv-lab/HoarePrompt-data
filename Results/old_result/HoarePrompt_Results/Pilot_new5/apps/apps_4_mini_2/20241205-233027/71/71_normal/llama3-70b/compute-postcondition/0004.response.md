The value of `n` is assigned the result of `n //= 10`, which performs integer division of `n` by 10. Since `n` must not be divisible by 10, this operation will update `n` to be the integer part of `n` divided by 10, which is guaranteed to be different from the previous value of `n`. The value of `w` remains increased by 1 as per the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // 10` (the integer division of its previous value by 10), `w` is increased by 1.**
