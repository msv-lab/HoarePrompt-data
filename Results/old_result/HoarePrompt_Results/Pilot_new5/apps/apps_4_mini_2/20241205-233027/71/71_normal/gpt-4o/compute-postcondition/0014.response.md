The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. Since `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0, the new value of `count_zeros` will be either 2 or 1 respectively. The states of the other variables `n`, `to_remove`, and `digit` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer not exceeding 2,000,000,000 and must not be empty, `count_zeros` is either 2 or 1, `to_remove` is either 0 or 1, `digit` is the second-to-last character in `n`.**
