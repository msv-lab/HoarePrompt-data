The code snippet provided is `print(w)`, which indicates that the program is attempting to print the value of the variable `w`. However, there is no prior indication about the state of `w`, and since it has not been defined in the initial state, it remains unknown. The initial state mentions that `n` is divisible by `10`, but this does not affect `w`.

Since `w` is not defined, attempting to print it would typically result in an error in a real execution. However, since the task requires providing the output state based on the available information, we note that no changes occurred to `n` or the currently undefined `w`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is divisible by `10`, and `w` is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is divisible by `10`, and `w` is undefined.**
