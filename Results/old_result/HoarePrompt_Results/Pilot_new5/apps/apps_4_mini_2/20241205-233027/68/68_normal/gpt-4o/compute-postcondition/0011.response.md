The `print('?')` statement outputs a string but does not modify any of the variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid and no values are changed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; and it holds that `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`. Additionally, it is the case that `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes.`, and `?` has been printed.**
