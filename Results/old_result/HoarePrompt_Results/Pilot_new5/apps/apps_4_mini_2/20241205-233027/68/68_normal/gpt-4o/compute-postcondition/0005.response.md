Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on input values within the range of 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`.***
