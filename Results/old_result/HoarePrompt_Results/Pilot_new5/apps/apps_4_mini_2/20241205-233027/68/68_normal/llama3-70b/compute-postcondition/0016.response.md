Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `'-'` is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and if `x` is equal to `y`, the output is '0' if `z` is 0, otherwise, the output is '?'. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?'.***
