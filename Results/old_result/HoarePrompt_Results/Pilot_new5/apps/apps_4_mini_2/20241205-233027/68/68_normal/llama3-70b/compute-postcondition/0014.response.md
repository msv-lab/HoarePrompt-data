The code snippet `print('?')` outputs the string `'?'` to the console. It does not modify any variables or their values. Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged, and no variables are affected. The output state includes all preconditions that are still valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`; output is '?'**
