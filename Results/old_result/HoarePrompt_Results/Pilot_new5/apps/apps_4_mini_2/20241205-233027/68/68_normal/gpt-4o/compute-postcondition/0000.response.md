The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes the input as a space-separated string, splits it into individual components, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively. Since the initial state allows for any integers between 0 and 100, the specific values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will depend on the user input. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now specific integers within the range of 0 to 100, based on the input provided. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on input values within the range of 0 to 100.**
