The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string '0' to the console. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are not modified by this code; their values remain the same as defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged status of the variables.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`, and the current value of `z` is 0. The printed output is '0'.**
