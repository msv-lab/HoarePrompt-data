The function `func` does not have any parameters to accept. However, it operates based on three integer variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained to be within the range of 0 to 100 (inclusive). Since there is no additional information provided regarding the output of the function, we cannot determine specific return values or cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on integers x, y, and z constrained between 0 and 100, but the specific return values are not defined.**
