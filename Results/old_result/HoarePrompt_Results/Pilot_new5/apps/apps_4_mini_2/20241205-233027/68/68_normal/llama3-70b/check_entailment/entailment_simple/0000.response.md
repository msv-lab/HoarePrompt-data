Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios described in the problem. 

Let's break down the requirements from the problem description:

1. If there are more upvotes than downvotes, the result should be "+".
2. If there are more downvotes than upvotes, the result should be "-".
3. If the upvotes and downvotes are equal and there are no unknown voters (z = 0), the result should be "0".
4. If upvotes and downvotes are equal and there are unknown voters (z > 0), the result should be "?" (uncertain).
5. If the unknown voters could swing the outcome (for example, if there are unknown voters and upvotes are less than downvotes), the result should also be "?".
  
Now, let's analyze the program's logic:

- The check `if (x > y + z)` correctly identifies when there are more upvotes than the maximum possible downvotes. This part is correct and will print "+".
- The check `if (x < y)` correctly identifies when there are more downvotes than upvotes, printing "-".
- The checks for the case when `x == y` are problematic:
  - If `z == 0`, it prints '0', which is correct.
  - If `z > 0`, it prints '?', which is also correct.
  
However, there is a missing check. The program does not account for scenarios where the number of unknown voters (z) can affect the outcome even when `x` is not equal to `y`. For example:
- If `x = 2`, `y = 3`, and `z = 2`, the output should be "?" because depending on how the two unknown voters vote, the final result could either be "-" (if both vote down) or "+" (if both vote up).
  
Thus, the program fails to account for cases where `z` affects the uncertainty of the result when `x < y`. It incorrectly assumes that if `x < y`, the result will always be "-", without considering the influence of `z`.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not handle all edge cases specified in the problem description accurately.
