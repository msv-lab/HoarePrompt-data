The code snippet `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the value of `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. Given that `visited` already contains `start`, the new state string will be added if it is not already present. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains `new_state_str` if it was not previously in `visited`; `visited` is now a set containing `start` and `new_state_str`, if `new_state_str` was not already in `visited`; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is the result of swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`; `new_state_str` is the concatenated string of `new_state`.**
