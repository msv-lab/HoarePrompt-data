Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if two sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration. 

### Issue:
The logic used in the `func_1` function is flawed. Specifically, the program attempts to swap the positions of the empty cells ('X') in the two puzzles, which does not make sense in the context of sliding puzzles. Simply swapping the empty cells will not yield a valid configuration since the tiles can only slide into the empty space, not swap locations with the empty space.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```
- Bessie's Puzzle: 
```
A B
X C
```
- Elsie's Puzzle: 
```
A C
B X
```
In this case, the correct answer is "NO" because there is no valid sequence of moves that would allow both puzzles to reach the same configuration. However, the current program logic would incorrectly evaluate this situation because it tries to check if sorted versions of the puzzles are the same after an invalid operation.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements set out in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
