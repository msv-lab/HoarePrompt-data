The variable `current` is assigned the value obtained by popping the leftmost element from `queue`. The initial state indicates that `queue` contains `start`, which is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. Therefore, after this operation, `current` will be equal to `start`, and `queue` will become empty. The `visited` set remains unchanged, as it still contains `start`. The `directions` list is also unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`.**
