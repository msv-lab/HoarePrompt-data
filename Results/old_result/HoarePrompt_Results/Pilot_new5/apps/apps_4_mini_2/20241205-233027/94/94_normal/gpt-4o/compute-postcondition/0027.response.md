Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX'; if `new_state_str` was not previously in `visited`, then `queue` now contains `new_state_str`, and `visited` includes both `start` and `new_state_str`. The values of `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `new_state` remain unchanged.***
