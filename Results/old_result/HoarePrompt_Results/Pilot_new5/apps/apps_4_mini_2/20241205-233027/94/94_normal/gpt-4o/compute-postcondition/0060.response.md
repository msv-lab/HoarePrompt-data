In the given code snippet, the operation swaps the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. 

1. The initial value of `empty_pos` is 3, and `new_pos` is 5.
2. The current `new_state` is a list that contains elements from `current`.
3. The elements at index 3 and index 5 in `new_state` are swapped.

Since the exact values in `new_state` are not provided, we can denote the values at those positions as `new_state[3]` and `new_state[5]`. 

Therefore, after the execution of the swap, the following information remains valid:
- `start` remains 'ABCX'.
- `queue` includes `new_state_str`.
- `visited` may include `new_state_str` if valid.
- `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` remains the state that was removed from `queue`.
- `empty_pos` is still 3.
- `empty_row` remains 1.
- `empty_col` remains 1.
- `new_row` remains 2.
- `new_col` remains 1.
- `new_pos` is still 5.
- `new_state` now has elements at index 3 and 5 swapped.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str`, `visited` may include `new_state_str` if valid, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 2, `new_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 5, `new_state` has elements at index 3 and 5 swapped.**
