The code swaps the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. Given that `new_state` is a list representation of `current`, the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` will be exchanged.

- The variables `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, and `current` remain unchanged.
- The `new_state` list will reflect the swapped values after the execution of the code.

Thus, the output state will include the updated values of `new_state` where `new_state[empty_pos]` becomes the previous value of `new_state[new_pos]`, and vice versa.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include valid `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is a valid state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is valid, `empty_row` is now `empty_row + dr`, `empty_col` is now `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state` reflects the swap between elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
