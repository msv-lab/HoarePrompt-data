The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The value of `new_state_str` is formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, which has been modified after swapping elements. The initial states for other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is modified after swapping elements, `new_state_str` is formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` includes 'ABXC' and `new_state_str', `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`, and `queue` includes `new_state_str` appended.**
