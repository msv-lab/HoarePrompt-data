The variable `visited` is assigned a set containing the variable `start`. The value of `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. Therefore, `visited` will contain this string as an element. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`.**
