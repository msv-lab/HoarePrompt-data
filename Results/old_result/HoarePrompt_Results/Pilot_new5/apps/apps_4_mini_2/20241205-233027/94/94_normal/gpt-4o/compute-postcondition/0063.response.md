The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`. The previous values of `queue` now include `new_state_str`, thus resulting in the updated state of `queue`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values, `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 2, `new_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 5, `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining `new_state`**.
