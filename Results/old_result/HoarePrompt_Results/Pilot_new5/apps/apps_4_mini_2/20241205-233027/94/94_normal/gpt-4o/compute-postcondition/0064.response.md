Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values, if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, while `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 2, `new_col` is 1, and `new_pos` is 5, and `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining `new_state`.***
