According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` has been updated to include all valid `new_state_str` generated during the iterations. If no valid moves were possible, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged from their initial state.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `queue` must contain valid states. Since it has already been updated during the previous iterations, we can assume that `queue` still has items in it, allowing the loop to proceed without any modifications.

State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include all valid `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the last state removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the last `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2.**
