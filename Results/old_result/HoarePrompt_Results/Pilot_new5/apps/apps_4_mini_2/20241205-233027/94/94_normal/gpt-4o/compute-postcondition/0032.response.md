The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`, which creates a new list from the `current` variable. The initial state does not specify what `current` is, so we cannot determine its content. However, we know that `new_state` will be a list representation of whatever `current` holds. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list representation of `current`.**
