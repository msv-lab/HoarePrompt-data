The code takes `new_state`, which is a list where the elements at indices 3 and 5 have been swapped, and then joins that list into a string called `new_state_str`. The `new_state_str` will therefore now reflect the new configuration after the swap. The values of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, and `new_col` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str`, `visited` may include `new_state_str` if valid, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 2, `new_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 5, `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining `new_state`.**
