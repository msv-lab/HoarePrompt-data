Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values plus `new_state_str`, `visited` includes `new_state_str` and previously stored values, `directions` remain [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the state that was removed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is equal to `1 + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `1 + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(1 + dr) * 2 + (1 + dc)`, `new_state_str` is the result of `''.join(new_state)` and `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`.**
