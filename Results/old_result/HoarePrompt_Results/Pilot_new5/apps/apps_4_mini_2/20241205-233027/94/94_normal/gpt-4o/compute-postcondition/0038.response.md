Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX'; if `new_row` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and `new_col` is between 0 and 1 (inclusive), then `new_state_str` is derived from `new_state` after swapping the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes `new_state_str` and `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.***
