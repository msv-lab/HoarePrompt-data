The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the direction tuples from `directions`. 

Given the initial state:
- `empty_row` is 1
- `empty_col` is 1
- `dr` and `dc` take values from the tuples in `directions`.

The calculation for `new_row` and `new_col` will be done for each direction:
1. For direction (-1, 0):
   - `new_row = 1 + (-1) = 0`
   - `new_col = 1 + 0 = 1`
   
2. For direction (1, 0):
   - `new_row = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `new_col = 1 + 0 = 1`
   
3. For direction (0, -1):
   - `new_row = 1 + 0 = 1`
   - `new_col = 1 + (-1) = 0`
   
4. For direction (0, 1):
   - `new_row = 1 + 0 = 1`
   - `new_col = 1 + 1 = 2`

Since `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated based on the initial values and the directions, their final values depend on the specific direction being processed, but we only have the calculations above.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the valid calculations for `new_row` and `new_col` based on the movement from the empty tile position.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is either 0, 2, or 1, and `new_col` is either 1, 1, 0, or 2 depending on the direction.**
