The line of code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current position of the empty space (`empty_row`, `empty_col`) and the direction specified by `dr` and `dc`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to include valid `new_state_str`, `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid moves, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is a valid state from `queue`, `empty_pos` is valid, `empty_row` is now `empty_row + dr`, `empty_col` is now `empty_col + dc`**
