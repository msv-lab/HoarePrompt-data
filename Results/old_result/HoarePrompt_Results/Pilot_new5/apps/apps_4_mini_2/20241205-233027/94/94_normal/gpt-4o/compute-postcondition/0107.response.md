The code snippet swaps the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the list `new_state`. The initial state provides the values required to determine the contents of `new_state` before the swap. 

1. **Identify Variables:**
   - `start` is 'ABCX'
   - `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C']
   - `new_state_str` is 'ABXC'
   - `visited` includes 'ABXC'
   - `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col` (the specific values of `new_row` and `new_col` are not provided, so we will treat `new_pos` as a calculated value)
   - `empty_pos` is not provided but is needed for the swap (we will treat it as a position in the range of `new_state`)

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code swaps the values at `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. The contents of `new_state` will change based on the values at these positions.

3. **Calculating New Values:**
   - After the swap, the element currently at `new_state[empty_pos]` will take the value of `new_state[new_pos]`, and vice versa.

4. **Updating State:**
   - The values of `start`, `new_state_str`, and `visited` remain unchanged.
   - The variable `new_state` will now reflect the swap of the two specified elements.

Since `empty_pos` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific values at those indices. However, we will keep the output state general.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is modified after swapping elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, `new_state_str` is 'ABXC', `visited` includes 'ABXC', `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
