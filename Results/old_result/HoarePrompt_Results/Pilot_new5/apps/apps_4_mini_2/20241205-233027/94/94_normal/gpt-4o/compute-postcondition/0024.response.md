The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which concatenates the elements of the list `new_state` into a single string. The values of `start`, `current`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_pos`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `new_state` remain unchanged, but now `new_state_str` holds the new string value created from the concatenation of `new_state`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains `new_state_str` if it was not previously in `visited`; `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is the result of swapping `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`; `new_state_str` is the concatenated string of `new_state`.**
