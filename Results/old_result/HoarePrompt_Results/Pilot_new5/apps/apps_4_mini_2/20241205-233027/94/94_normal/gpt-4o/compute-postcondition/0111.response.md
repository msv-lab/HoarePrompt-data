Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `new_state` is modified after swapping elements, `new_state_str` is formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `visited` includes 'ABXC'. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is appended to `queue` and `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`.***
