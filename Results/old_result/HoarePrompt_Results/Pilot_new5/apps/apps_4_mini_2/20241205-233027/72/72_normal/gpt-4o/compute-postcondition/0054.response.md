According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `col` and the value of `m`. The loop is designed to iterate for each value of `col` from 0 to `m-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `col` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `col` needs to increase by 1, making it 2. The loop will continue executing as long as `col` is less than `m`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` are positive integers greater than 1, `direction` is either 1 or -1, `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0, `_` is still 0, `col` is 2**
