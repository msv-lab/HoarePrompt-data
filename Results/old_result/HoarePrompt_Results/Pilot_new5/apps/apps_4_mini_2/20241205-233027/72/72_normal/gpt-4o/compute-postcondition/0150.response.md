Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than `col + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `direction` is now 1, `max_questions` is one less than its previous value, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is updated to `row + 1`, and `col` remains `col + 1` if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. If `row` was initially -1, these conditions are applied; otherwise, the program does not alter `m`, `k`, `direction`, `max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, `row`, or `col`.***
