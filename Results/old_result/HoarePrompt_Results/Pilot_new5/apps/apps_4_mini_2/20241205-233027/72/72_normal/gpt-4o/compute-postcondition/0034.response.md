The value of `row` is incremented by `direction`. Given that `direction` is not equal to 1, `row` will either increase by a value other than 1, remain the same, or decrease. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `row` is increased by `direction`, `direction` is not equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `row` is increased by `direction`, `direction` is not equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is reduced by 1**
