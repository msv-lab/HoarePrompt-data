Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are positive integers. If `direction` equals 1 and `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 4`, `col` remains `m - 1`, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `remaining_questions` remains a positive integer. If `row` equals -1, then `direction` is set to 1, `row` equals `n - 1`, and `col` equals `m - 1.***
