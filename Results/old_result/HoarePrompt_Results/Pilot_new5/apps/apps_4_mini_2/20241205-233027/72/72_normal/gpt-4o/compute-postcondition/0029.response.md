The `direction` variable is assigned the value `-1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `row` is 1, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `row` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `row` is 1, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `row` is equal to `n.**
