The variable `max_questions` is incremented by 1. As the initial state does not provide the value for `max_questions`, we can only state that it has been increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `row` is 0, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `col` is 0, and `max_questions` is incremented by 1.**
