Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is unchanged, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `row` is updated to 1, `col` is 0, and `direction` equals 1 if `row` is -1. Otherwise, if `row` is not -1, the variables maintain their respective states as described in the precondition.***
