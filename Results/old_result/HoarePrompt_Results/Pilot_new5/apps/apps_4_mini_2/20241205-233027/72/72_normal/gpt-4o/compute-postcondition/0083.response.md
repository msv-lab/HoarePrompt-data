The value of `row` is incremented by `direction`. Given that `direction` is either -1, `row` will decrease by 1. Since `row` is between 0 and `n-1`, after the update, `row` will still be within the bounds of its allowed values as long as it is greater than 0 before the update. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions` are positive integers, `direction` is either -1, `row` is between 0 and `n-1` decreased by 1, `col` is 0.**
