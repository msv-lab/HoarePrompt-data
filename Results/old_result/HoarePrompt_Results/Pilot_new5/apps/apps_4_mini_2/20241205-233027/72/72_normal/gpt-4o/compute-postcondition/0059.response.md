The value of `direction` is assigned -1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `remaining_questions`, `_`, `col`, `max_questions`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` must be greater than 2; `k` are positive integers greater than 1; `direction` is -1; `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0; `_` is still 0; `col` is 2; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `row` is either `row + 1` or `row - 1.`
