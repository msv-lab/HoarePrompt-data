The variable `max_questions` is recalculated based on the new value of `full_cycles`. The value of `full_cycles` is given by `k // full_cycle_length`, and `full_cycle_length` is defined as `(2 * n - 2) * m`. Therefore, `max_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`.

Before running the code, the value of `max_questions` was equal to `full_cycles`. Now, it gets a new value based on the adjusted formula.

The states of the other variables are unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `y` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, where `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`**.
