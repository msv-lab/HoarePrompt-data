The value of `row` is incremented by `direction`. Since `direction` can either be 1 or -1, the new value of `row` will be either `row + 1` or `row - 1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` must be greater than 2; `k` are positive integers greater than 1; `direction` is either 1 or -1; `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0; `_` is still 0; `col` is 2; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `row` is either `row + 1` or `row - 1`.

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 2; `k` are positive integers greater than 1; `direction` is either 1 or -1; `remaining_questions` remains greater than 0; `_` is still 0; `col` is 2; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `row` is either `row + 1` or `row - 1.**
