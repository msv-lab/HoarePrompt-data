Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `y` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `full_cycles` is equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, where `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `remaining_questions` is equal to `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`, and `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.***
