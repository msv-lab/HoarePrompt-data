The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned based on user input. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state indicates that these variables have been updated to hold the new values input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an input positive integer, `m` is assigned an input positive integer, `k` is assigned an input positive integer, `x` is assigned an input positive integer, `y` is assigned an input positive integer**.
