Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` are positive integers. If `direction` equals 1 and `row` is equal to `n`, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is updated to its previous value minus 3, and `direction` is set to -1. If `direction` does not equal 1, then `n`, `m`, and `k` are all decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, and `remaining_questions` are positive integers. If `row` is -1, then `row` is set to 3.***
