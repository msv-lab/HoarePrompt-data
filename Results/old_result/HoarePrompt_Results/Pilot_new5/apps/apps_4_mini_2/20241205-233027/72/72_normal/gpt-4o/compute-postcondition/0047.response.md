Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are greater than 1; `k` are positive integers; `direction` equals -1. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `old_row - 2`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. The values of `remaining_questions` remain greater than 0, `_` is still 0, and `col` is 1.***
