The variable `row` is decremented by 2. Given that the current value of `row` is equal to `n` (which is a positive integer), the new value of `row` will be `n - 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `row` is `n - 2`, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `col` is 0, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `row` was equal to `n`.**
