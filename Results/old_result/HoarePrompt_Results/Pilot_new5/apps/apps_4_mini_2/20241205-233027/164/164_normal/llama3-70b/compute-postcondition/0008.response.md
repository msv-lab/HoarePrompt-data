The variable `t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` is now 0 while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is 0. The character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', and the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T'.**
