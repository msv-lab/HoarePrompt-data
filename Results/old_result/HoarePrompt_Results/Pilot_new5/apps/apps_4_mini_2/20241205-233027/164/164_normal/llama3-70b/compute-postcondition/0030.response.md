Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; if either `g == -1` or `t == -1`, the state remains unchanged regarding `n`, `k`, `g`, and `t`. Otherwise, if both `g` and `t` are not -1, "YES" is printed if the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k` and for every `i` in the range from 0 to (abs(t - g) // k), `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is not '#'. If either condition is not met, "NO" is printed.***
