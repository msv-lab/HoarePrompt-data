`T_pos` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in the string `line`. The value of `T_pos` is determined by the position of 'T' within `line`, which is not specified in the initial state. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, and `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`.**
