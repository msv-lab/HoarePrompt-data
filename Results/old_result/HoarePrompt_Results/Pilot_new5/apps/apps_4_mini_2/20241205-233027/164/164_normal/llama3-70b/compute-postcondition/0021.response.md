After analyzing the loop and considering the provided initial state, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in string `s` or remains -1 if 'G' does not exist; `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in string `s` or remains -1 if 'T' does not exist.**
