Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it assumes that if the grasshopper starts to the left of the insect (`G_pos < T_pos`), it can only jump to the right toward the insect. However, it does not check if there are obstacles before the insect when jumping from the grasshopper's position to the insect's position. 

For instance, consider the input case:

```
6 2
..#GT.
```

In this input, the grasshopper is at position 3 (0-indexed) and the insect is at position 4. The jump length `k` is 2. The grasshopper can only jump to position 5 (2 cells to the right), which is empty, but it cannot reach the position of the insect (4) because it's blocked by an obstacle (the `#` at position 2). 

The program would incorrectly output "YES" for this case since it checks from the grasshopper's position to the insect's position but does not properly consider the obstacle in between. 

Thus, the program fails to account for obstacles that can block the path, leading to potentially incorrect outputs.
