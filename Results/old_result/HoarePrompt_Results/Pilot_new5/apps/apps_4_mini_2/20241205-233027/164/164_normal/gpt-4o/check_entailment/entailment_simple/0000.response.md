Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's an explanation of how it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading two integers, `n` and `k`, which represent the number of cells and the length of the grasshopper's jump, respectively. It then reads a string representing the layout of the cells. This matches the input specifications provided in the problem description.

2. **Finding Positions**: The program correctly identifies the positions of the grasshopper ('G') and the insect ('T') using the `index` method. This is essential since the goal is to determine if the grasshopper can reach the insect.

3. **Position Adjustment**: If the grasshopper's position (`G_pos`) is greater than the insect's position (`T_pos`), the positions are swapped, ensuring that the program always checks from left to right. This is appropriate as it simplifies the subsequent checks.

4. **Jump Simulation**: The program simulates jumps by iterating from `G_pos` to `T_pos`, moving in increments of `k`. This is aligned with the grasshopper's ability to jump exactly `k` cells at a time. The loop will stop if an obstacle ('#') is encountered or if `T_pos` is reached.

5. **Reachability Check**: The variable `reachable` is used to track whether the grasshopper can reach the insect. If the loop reaches the position of 'T', `reachable` is set to `True`, and 'YES' is printed. If the loop encounters an obstacle before reaching 'T', `reachable` remains `False`, and 'NO' is printed.

6. **Output**: The output matches the required format, printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the grasshopper can reach the insect.

The program correctly adheres to the problem description, properly handling edge cases such as the presence of obstacles and the movement logic, ensuring that all conditions are checked accurately. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
