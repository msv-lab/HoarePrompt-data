The variable `reachable` is assigned the value `False`, which means it is updated but has no dependency on other variables in the provided context. The conditions involving `G_pos` and `T_pos` are not modified by this line of code, so no updates occur for `G_pos` or `T_pos`. 

Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`, `reachable` is False**.
