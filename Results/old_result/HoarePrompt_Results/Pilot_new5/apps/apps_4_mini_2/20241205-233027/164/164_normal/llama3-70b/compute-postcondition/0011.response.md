According to the code, the iteration of the loop depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), the loop can still execute for the next iteration. 

At the start of the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Given that `n` is at least 2, this condition will still hold true (i.e., \(1 < n\)).

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect `i` being 1. Since the values of `g` and `t` depend on the character at index `i` of string `s`, but we do not have the character at index 1 provided, we represent the possible values of `g` and `t` based on the conditions stated in the prompt.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 1, `g` remains -1 or is set to 0 if `s[1]` is 'G', and `t` remains -1 or is set to 0 if `s[1]` is 'T'**
