Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in string `s`, such that `g` is not -1; `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in string `s`, such that `t` is not -1. The absolute difference `abs(t - g)` is not divisible by `k`, or there exists at least one index `i` such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is equal to '#' for `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`.***
