To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step against the requirements.

### Problem Recap
- The grasshopper can jump `k` cells away, either left or right.
- The grasshopper starts at position 'G' and wants to reach position 'T'.
- Obstacles represented by '#' must be avoided.
- We need to return "YES" if the grasshopper can reach 'T' from 'G', otherwise "NO".

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly takes the number of cells `n` and jump length `k`, as well as the configuration string `s`.

2. **Finding Positions**: It correctly identifies the positions of 'G' (grasshopper) and 'T' (target) by looping through the string.

3. **Jump Feasibility**:
   - The code checks if the absolute difference between 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of `k`, ensuring that the grasshopper can potentially reach 'T'.
   - The use of `all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))` is intended to check if all the cells that would be landed on during the jumps are free of obstacles.

### Potential Issues
The main potential issue in the current implementation is in the way the code checks for obstacles. The modulo operation `s[(g + i * k) % n]` could lead to an incorrect index when the grasshopper jumps beyond `n` or if it wraps around improperly. 

For instance, consider the following case:
```
Input:
6 3
G####T
```
- The grasshopper starts at index `0` (G), and the target is at index `5` (T).
- The difference is `5 - 0 = 5`, which is not a multiple of `3` (since 5 % 3 = 2), so the program would return "NO".
- However, there is no path because all intermediate cells are blocked by '#'. The condition to check the obstacles would never be reached.

### Conclusion
This shows that there might be cases where the obstacles are not properly considered due to the modulo operation and the check only for multiples of `k` without considering blocked paths correctly.

Based on this reasoning, the implementation may not cover all edge cases properly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
Correctness: **False**
