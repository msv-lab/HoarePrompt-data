Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (the length of the cells string, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` (the maximum jump length, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), followed by a string representing cells containing one 'G', one 'T', obstacles '#', and empty cells '.'. It checks if it is possible to reach 'T' from 'G' using jumps of length `k`. The function will print "YES" if 'T' is reachable from 'G' without hitting an obstacle, otherwise it prints "NO". The code assumes valid input constraints are met without additional error handling for invalid inputs. **
