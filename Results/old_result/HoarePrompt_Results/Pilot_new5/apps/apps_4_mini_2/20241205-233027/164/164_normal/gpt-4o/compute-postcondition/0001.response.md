The value of `line` is assigned the value `input()`, which accepts an input string representing the cells. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), and that `line` has a length of `n`, containing exactly one 'G' and one 'T', with '.' for empty cells and '#' for obstacles. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string representing the cells**.
