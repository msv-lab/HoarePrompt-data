The value of `value` is incremented by `q` raised to the power of `(n - i - 1)`. Given the initial values: `q` is 5, `n` is 2, and `i` is 1, we can calculate the exponent:

1. Calculate `n - i - 1`: 
   - `2 - 1 - 1 = 0`
   
2. Then calculate `q ** (n - i - 1)`:
   - `5 ** 0 = 1`
   
3. Finally, update `value`:
   - `value` was initially 5, so we do `5 + 1 = 6`.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a tuple of two non-empty strings where the character at index 1 of `s` is '1', `q` is 5, `value` is 6, `n` is 2, and `i` is 1**.
