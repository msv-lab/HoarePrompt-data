#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple of two non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, where the length of each string does not exceed 100000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a tuple of two non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is equal to 5, `value` is the result of the polynomial evaluation based on the binary representation in `s`, which can either be 5 (if `s` is ('1', '0')), 6 (if `s` is ('1', '1')), or 0 (if `s` is ('0', '0')), `n` is 2.
    return value
    #The program returns the result of the polynomial evaluation based on the binary representation in 's', which can be 5, 6, or 0 depending on the values in the tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of two non-empty binary strings and returns a numerical result based on the polynomial evaluation of the first string, which can be 5, 6, or 0 depending on the binary representation of the first string. The second string is not used in the calculation.
