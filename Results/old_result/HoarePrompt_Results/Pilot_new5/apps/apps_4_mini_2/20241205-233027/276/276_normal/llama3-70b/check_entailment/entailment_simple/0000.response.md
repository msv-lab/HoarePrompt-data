Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to compare two numbers represented in the "golden system" as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two non-empty strings composed of '0's and '1's, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Conversion Function**: The function `func_1` computes the decimal value of a number represented in the golden system. It does this by:
   - Initializing a variable `decimal` to zero.
   - For each character in the reversed string, it calculates its contribution to the total value using the formula \( \text{int}(c) \cdot q^{i} \), where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).
   - The use of `reversed(s)` ensures that the characters are processed from least significant to most significant (right to left), aligning with how positional value works.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After computing the decimal values of both inputs, the program compares these values:
   - It prints '>' if the first number is larger, '<' if it is smaller, and '=' if they are equal.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program is built to handle the maximum constraints, with the length of the strings not exceeding 100,000 characters. Since the conversion function efficiently processes the string and uses floating-point arithmetic appropriately, it can handle large values without significant performance issues.

Overall, the program accurately implements the required operations as specified in the problem description, allowing it to correctly determine the relative sizes of two numbers in the golden system. Hence, it is correct.
