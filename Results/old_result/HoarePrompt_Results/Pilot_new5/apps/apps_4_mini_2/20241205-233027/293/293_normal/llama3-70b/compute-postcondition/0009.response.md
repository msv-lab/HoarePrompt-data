To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `n > 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we have `n` is greater than or equal to 1, but we need `n` to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Since `n` was assigned the value `n // 2` in the previous iteration, this indicates that `n` must have been at least 2 before the assignment to ensure that after halving, it remains greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must have originally been greater than or equal to 2 before being halved.

Thus, we deduce that the states need to be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
