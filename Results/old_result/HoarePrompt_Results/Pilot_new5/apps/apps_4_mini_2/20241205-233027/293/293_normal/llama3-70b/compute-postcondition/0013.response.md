The value of `n` is halved with the operation `n //= 2`. Given the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and halving it will yield a new value of `n` that is still at least 1. The variable `ans` is not affected by this operation, and its previous value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is at least 1 after halving, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
