To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze what the program does and how it relates to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The input is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
2. The program needs to find some positive integer `m` such that the expression `n * m + 1` is not a prime number.
3. The valid range for `m` is 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and it is guaranteed that a counterexample exists.

### Program Analysis:
The program does the following:
- It reads an integer `n` from input.
- It then iterates over integers `m` from 1 to 1000.
- In each iteration, it calculates `x = n * m + 1` and checks if `x` is not a prime number using the function `func_1`.
- If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints `m` and breaks the loop.

### Function `func_1`:
This function checks if a number `x` is a prime number:
- If `x <= 1`, it returns `False`.
- If `x <= 3`, it returns `True` (this is correct for prime checking).
- If `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
- For larger numbers, it checks divisibility for potential factors from 5 onward, skipping even numbers and multiples of 3.

### Verification of Requirements:
The program is designed to find an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime. Here's how it fulfills the requirements:
1. The loop correctly checks values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
2. The condition `if not func_1(n * m + 1)` ensures that it only prints the first `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not prime.
3. The function `func_1` accurately determines the primality of `n * m + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic needed to satisfy the problem description.
- Given that the problem guarantees a counterexample exists, the program will always find an `m` within the specified range.

### Final Output:
Correctness: **True**
