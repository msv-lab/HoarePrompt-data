According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. The loop starts at 2 and goes up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. 

For the loop to execute, `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 2, which means:

1. The smallest value for `num` such that its square root is at least 2 is `num = 4` since `int(4 ** 0.5) = 2`.
2. Given that `num` is a positive integer with the constraint 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000 and must be greater than or equal to 2, it is necessary that `num` is at least 4 for the loop to have any iterations.

Before the loop starts:
- `num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, 
- For the loop to execute, `num` must be at least 4, and `i` must be initialized to 2.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `num` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2**
