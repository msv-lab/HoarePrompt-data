Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `num` is an odd number greater than or equal to 9, and `i` is `k + 1`, with `k + 1` less than or equal to `int(num)`. If `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not prime. If `num` is not divisible by `i`, the function proceeds without returning a value.***
