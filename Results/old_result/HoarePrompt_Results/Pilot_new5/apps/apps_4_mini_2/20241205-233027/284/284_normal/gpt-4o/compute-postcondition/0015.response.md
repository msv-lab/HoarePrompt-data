To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to assess the condition `i * i <= x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `i` is 11.
- `x` is a positive integer larger than or equal to 25 that is neither divisible by 2 nor 3, and also is not divisible by 5 or 7.

First, we calculate `i * i`:
- `i * i` = 11 * 11 = 121.

For the loop to execute again, we need the condition `121 <= x` to hold true. 

Since `x` is a positive integer larger than or equal to 25, the variable `x` must be at least 121 in order for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to run again, we need to adjust `x` so that it is greater than or equal to 121.

Consequently, the necessary adjustment is:
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 121.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the values of `n` and `i` are already appropriate for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` must be greater than or equal to 121; `i` is 11**.
