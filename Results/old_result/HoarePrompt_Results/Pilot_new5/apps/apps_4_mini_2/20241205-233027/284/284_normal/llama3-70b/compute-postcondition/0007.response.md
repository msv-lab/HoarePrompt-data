According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the calculated upper limit of the loop, which is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than this upper limit.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `num` is an odd number greater than or equal to 4. The square root of `num` will be a positive number, and since `num` is at least 4, `int(num ** 0.5)` will be at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`.

After the last iteration where `i` is 2, `i` will increment by 1 in the next loop iteration. Thus, `i` will be 3 for the next execution.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 3. This means `num` must be at least 9 (since the square root of 9 is 3). 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state as follows:
State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than or equal to 9 and is an odd number, `i` is 3**
