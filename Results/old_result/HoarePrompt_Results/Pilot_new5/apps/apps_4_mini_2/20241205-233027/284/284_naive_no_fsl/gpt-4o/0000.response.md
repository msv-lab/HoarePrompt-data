Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly checks for non-prime values using the `func_1` function. The `func_1` function appears to be structured to determine if a number is prime, but it can miss certain composite numbers, especially as it only checks the divisibility of numbers against specific divisors (2 and 3) before using a loop starting from 5. 

One potential failure case is when `n` is equal to 1. In this case, for `m = 1`, the expression becomes `1 * 1 + 1 = 2`, which is prime, and the program continues searching. However, for `m = 2`, we have `1 * 2 + 1 = 3`, which is also prime. This continues until `m = 1000`, where the resulting value will always be prime. 

Thus, the program has the potential to run into a situation where it does not find a composite number for `n = 1`, violating the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases as specified, confirming that the correctness is **False**.
