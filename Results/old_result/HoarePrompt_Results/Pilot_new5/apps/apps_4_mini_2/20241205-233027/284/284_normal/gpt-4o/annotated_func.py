    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, and `x` is a positive integer larger than 3. The integer `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `x` is a positive integer larger than or equal to 361 that is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3, and `x` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, or 13; `i` is the smallest integer greater than 5 such that \( i^2 > x \).
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` and determines if it is a prime number. It returns False if `x` is less than or equal to 1, if it is less than or equal to 3 (but greater than 1 and 3), or if it is divisible by 2 or 3. For numbers greater than 3 that are not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks divisibility against all integers of the form 6k ± 1 up to the square root of `x`. If none of these conditions indicate non-primality, it returns True, indicating that `x` is a prime number. Missing from the annotations is the handling of cases where `x` is specifically 2 or 3, which should return True, as well as the comprehensive prime check for larger values of `x`.
