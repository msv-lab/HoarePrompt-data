The program is designed to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis by generating a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for a given positive integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)). The goal is to demonstrate that for this \( n \), there exists an \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq m \leq 1000 \)) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer \( n \).

2. **Loop Structure**: It iterates over \( m \) from 1 to 1000, which is within the specified bounds.

3. **Prime Checking Function (func_1)**:
   - It correctly identifies numbers that are not prime (e.g., numbers less than or equal to 1, even numbers greater than 2, and multiples of 3).
   - It uses a method for checking the primality of numbers greater than 3 by checking divisibility against numbers of the form \( 6k \pm 1 \), which is an efficient way to check for primes.

4. **Finding a Counterexample**: The program checks \( n \cdot m + 1 \) for primality. If the result is not prime (i.e., `func_1` returns `False`), it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

### Verification against the Problem Description:

- The program meets the requirements of the problem statement as it asserts that for any input \( n \), it will find an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime. The loop continues until it finds such an \( m \) or goes through all possible values of \( m \) (up to 1000), ensuring it covers all cases.

- The problem guarantees that there exists a counterexample, and the logic within `func_1` correctly identifies non-prime numbers. Thus, it will indeed find and print a suitable \( m \) as required by the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Since the program follows the requirements of the problem description and accounts for all necessary cases to find a suitable \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
