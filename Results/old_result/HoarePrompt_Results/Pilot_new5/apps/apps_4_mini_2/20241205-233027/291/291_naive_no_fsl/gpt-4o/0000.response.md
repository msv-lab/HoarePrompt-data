Correctness: **False**

The issue with the program arises in how it calculates the minimum number of segments needed to draw the squares. The logic assumes that the segments can be arranged in a rectangular configuration, which is not necessarily correct for all values of `n`. 

For example:
- For `n = 3`, according to the problem description, Sofia would need to draw at least 4 segments since she can only use the segments already drawn as a guide. However, the program calculates a minimum of 6 segments needed due to its approach of dividing `n` into factors without considering the specific arrangement of squares.

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an incorrect output for at least some values of `n`.
