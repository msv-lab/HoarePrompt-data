To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem requirements and the implementation provided.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Requirement**:
   - Sofia wants to draw `n` squares. Each square consists of 4 segments.
   - To minimize the number of segments drawn without a guide, Sofia can reuse segments from previously drawn squares.
   - The goal is to calculate the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler.

2. **Examples Provided**:
   - For `n = 1`: 2 segments need to be drawn (both vertical or horizontal).
   - For `n = 2`: 3 segments need to be drawn.
   - For `n = 4`: 4 segments need to be drawn.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The number of segments drawn with a ruler seems to follow a specific pattern based on the number of squares.
   - As can be inferred from the examples, the minimum number of segments needed seems to be consistent and follows a specific calculation.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2)
```
- It uses `n.bit_length()`, which returns the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary.
- The formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` is used to calculate the result.

### Checking the Correctness:
1. **Understanding `n.bit_length()`**:
   - `n.bit_length()` gives the number of bits needed to represent `n` in binary format. 
   - For example:
     - `n = 1` (binary `1`): `bit_length` is `1`; `2 * (1 - 1) + 2 = 2`
     - `n = 2` (binary `10`): `bit_length` is `2`; `2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 4`
     - `n = 3` (binary `11`): `bit_length` is `2`; `2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 4`
     - `n = 4` (binary `100`): `bit_length` is `3`; `2 * (3 - 1) + 2 = 6`, which is incorrect.

2. **Identifying Flaws**:
   - The calculations based on `n.bit_length()` do not seem to accurately reflect the number of segments needed for all cases, particularly the examples given in the problem description.
   - For instance, for `n = 4`, the program outputs `6`, while the problem states that the correct answer is `4`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not implement the logic required to compute the minimum number of segments Sofia needs to draw with a ruler. The reliance on `bit_length()` leads to incorrect outputs, as demonstrated by analyzing specific cases.

Correctness: **False**
