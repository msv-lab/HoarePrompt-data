To assess the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it accurately computes the minimum number of segments that Sofia has to draw with a ruler for any given number of squares \( n \).

The key logic in the program is as follows:
1. It iterates over possible values of \( a \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \).
2. For each \( a \), it calculates \( b \), which represents how many segments are needed in the other dimension to cover the squares, making sure to round up when necessary.
3. It then computes the total number of segments needed (`segments_needed`), which is \( 2 \times (a + b) \).
4. It keeps track of the minimum number of segments required through the iterations.

### Potential Cases to Check
1. **Case where \( n = 1 \)**: 
   - Expected output: 2 (1 square requires 2 segments).
   - Program output: `func_1(1)` gives \( 2 \).
  
2. **Case where \( n = 2 \)**:
   - Expected output: 3 (2 squares can share segments).
   - Program output: `func_1(2)` gives \( 3 \).

3. **Case where \( n = 4 \)**:
   - Expected output: 4 (4 squares can share segments).
   - Program output: `func_1(4)` gives \( 4 \).

4. **Case where \( n = 3 \)**:
   - Expected output: 4 (3 squares need at least 4 segments).
   - Program output: The program calculates \( a = 1 \) leads to \( b = 3 \), giving \( 2 \times (1 + 3) = 8 \) (not correct).
   - Next, \( a = 2 \) gives \( b = 2 \), resulting in \( 2 \times (2 + 2) = 8 \) (still not correct).
   - The result returned is \( 8 \), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program fails to accurately compute the number of segments for certain values of \( n \) (for example \( n = 3 \)). Therefore, as it does not handle all cases correctly, the conclusion about correctness is:

Correctness: **False**.
