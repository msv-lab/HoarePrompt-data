The code `print(len(operations))` prints the length of the list `operations`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `operations`. Since the values of `operations` are unknown, we cannot determine its length.

The values of the variables `A` and `B`, as well as the dimensions `n` and `m`, remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`B` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions n x m, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions n x m, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and for all `i` in range(n) and for all `j` in range(m), `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`; the length of `operations` is unknown.**
