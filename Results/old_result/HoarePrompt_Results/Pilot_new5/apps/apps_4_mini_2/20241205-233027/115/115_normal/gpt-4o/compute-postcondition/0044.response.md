The code appends a tuple to the `operations` list, where the tuple consists of the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. The previous value of `i` is 2, and the previous value of `j` is 3. Thus, `i + 1` is 3 and `j + 1` is 4. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers, `j` is 3, `B[2][3]` is 1, `B[2][4]` is 1, `B[3][3]` is 1, `B[3][4]` is 1, and `operations` has a new tuple (3, 4) appended.**
