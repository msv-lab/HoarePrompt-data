The operation `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are currently 1 and 0, respectively. Thus, the tuple that is appended will be `(2, 1)`, as `i + 1` equals 2 and `j + 1` equals 1.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(2, 1)`, `j` is now 0, and at least one of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` contains tuples including (2, 1), `j` is now 0, and at least one of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1.**
