The code initializes an empty list named `operations`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state captures the initialization of `operations`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, with dimensions n x m; `operations` is an empty list.**
