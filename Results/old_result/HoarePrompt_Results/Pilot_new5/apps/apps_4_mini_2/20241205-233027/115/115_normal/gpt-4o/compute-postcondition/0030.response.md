Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), and `B` has `B[1][j] = 1`, `B[1][j + 1] = 1`, `B[2][j] = 1`, `B[2][j + 1] = 1`. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, then `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are set to 1, and `operations` now contains the tuple `(2, j + 1)`.***
