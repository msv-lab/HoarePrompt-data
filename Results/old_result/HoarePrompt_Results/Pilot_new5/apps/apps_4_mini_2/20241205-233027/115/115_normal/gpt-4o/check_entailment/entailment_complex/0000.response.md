Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes matrix `B` with dimensions `n x m`, filled with zeros, which aligns with the problem description that states `B` should start as a matrix of zeros.

2. **Operation Check for 2x2 Submatrices**: The nested loops iterate through matrix `A` to check for `2x2` submatrices of `1`s. When it finds such a submatrix, it updates the corresponding `2x2` area in matrix `B` to `1` and records the operation (the top-left coordinates of that submatrix).

3. **Final Equality Check**: After performing the operations, the program checks if matrix `B` matches matrix `A`. If there are any discrepancies, it returns `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to make `B` equal to `A`. 

4. **Output Operations**: If matrix `B` matches matrix `A`, the program prints the count of operations and the corresponding indices of the operations that were performed, which is consistent with the output format specified in the problem.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where no operations are needed (i.e., when `A` is entirely zeros) by simply outputting `0` operations.

The logic implemented ensures that all configurations of `A` that can be formed using the allowed `2x2` operations will be addressed. Thus, it meets the requirements of the problem statement under all conditions specified.
