The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the tuple becomes `(0 + 1, 1 + 1)` which simplifies to `(1, 2)`. The values of `A`, `n`, `m` remain unchanged, while `i` retains its initial value of 0. The output reflects the new state of `ops`, which now contains the appended tuple.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 1, and `ops` contains the tuple (1, 2).**
