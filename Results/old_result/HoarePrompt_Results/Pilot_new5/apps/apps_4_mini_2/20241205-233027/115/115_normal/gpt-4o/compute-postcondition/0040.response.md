The code appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. The values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 2, respectively. Thus, the new tuple added to `operations` will be (3, 3) because `i + 1` equals 3 and `j + 1` equals 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers, `j` is 2, `B[2][2]`, `B[2][3]`, `B[3][2]`, and `B[3][3]` are all updated to `1`, and `operations` now includes tuples (2, 1), (3, 1), and (3, 3)**.
