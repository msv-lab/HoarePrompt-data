Postcondition: ***`B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `m` is greater than 1, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the current value of `j` and `k` is less than `m`. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. If `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`, there are no changes or returns from the function.***
