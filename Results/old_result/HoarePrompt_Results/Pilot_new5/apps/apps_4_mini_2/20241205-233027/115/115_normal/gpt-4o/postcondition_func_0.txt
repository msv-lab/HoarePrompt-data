The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A` of integers, checks for 2x2 submatrices of 1s in `A`, sets corresponding elements in a new matrix `B`, and returns -1 if `A` and `B` do not match. The function prints the count of valid operations and their indices but does not provide any return value indicating success or the operations performed if there are no mismatches.
