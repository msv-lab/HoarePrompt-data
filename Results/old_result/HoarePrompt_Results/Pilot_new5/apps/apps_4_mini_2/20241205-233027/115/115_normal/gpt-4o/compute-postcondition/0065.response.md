According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. Since the loop iterates over `j` in the range of `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and since the loop has executed for all values of `j` from 0 to `m-1`, the next value of `j` will be `m`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `m`, which is the next value after the last executed value (m-1). 

Also, since `m` is greater than 0, the loop will not execute again if `j` reaches `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration must reflect that `j` is now `m`.

State: **`B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, and for all j in range(m), `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`, `j` is m**
