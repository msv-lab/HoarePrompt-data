Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions `n` x `m`, `operations` includes tuples of the form `(1, j + 1)` for valid 2x2 submatrices found in `A`, `j` is 0. The current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.***
