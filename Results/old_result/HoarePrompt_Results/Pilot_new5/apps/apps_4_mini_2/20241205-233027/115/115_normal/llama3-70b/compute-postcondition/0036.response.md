The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Given that the initial state indicates `j` must be less than `m - 2`, the state of the variables does not change, but control flow is affected. 

Since the exact values of `i`, `j`, and `m` are not provided, we cannot make specific numerical updates, but we can say that the loop will skip the rest of the current iteration.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, `j` must be less than `m - 2`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
