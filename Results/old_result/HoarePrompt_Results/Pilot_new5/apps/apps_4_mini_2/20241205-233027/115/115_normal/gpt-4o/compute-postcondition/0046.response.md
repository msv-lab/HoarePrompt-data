Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers where all corresponding 2x2 submatrices set to 1 based on the conditions of `A` have been fully processed, and `operations` contains tuples of the form `(2, j + 1)` for each valid 2x2 submatrix found in `A` that meets the specified conditions, with `j` ranging from 0 to `m-2`.**
