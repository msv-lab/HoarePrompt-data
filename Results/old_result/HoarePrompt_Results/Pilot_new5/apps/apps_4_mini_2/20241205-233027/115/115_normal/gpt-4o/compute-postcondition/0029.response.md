The operation appends a tuple containing the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the `operations` list. The variable `i` is currently 1, so `i + 1` becomes 2. The value of `j` is not given in the initial state, but `j + 1` will depend on the value of `j`. Since `j` is not defined at this point, we can state it as a variable.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `operations` list with a new tuple appended.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` has `B[1][j] = 1`, `B[1][j + 1] = 1`, `B[2][j] = 1`, `B[2][j + 1] = 1`, and `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1, and `operations` now contains the tuple `(2, j + 1)`.**
