To analyze the given program, we can follow through its logic and compare it against the problem requirements.

The problem description states that we need to check if we can make matrix B equal to matrix A by applying a series of operations involving 2x2 submatrices. Specifically, we can only set 1s in B where the corresponding 2x2 region in A is fully filled with 1s.

### Code Logic Breakdown:
1. The program reads the dimensions of matrix A (n, m) and then constructs matrix A from input.
2. It initializes matrix B as a matrix filled with 0s.
3. The program attempts to fill matrix B by iterating through potential positions for 2x2 submatrices in A:
   - It checks if the current position A[i][j] and its immediate right, down, and diagonal bottom right positions contain 1s. If they do, it marks the corresponding 2x2 area in B as 1s and records the operation.
4. Finally, the program checks if matrices A and B are equal. If they are not, it returns -1.

### Potential Problem Cases:
1. **Case of Isolated 1s**: If matrix A has isolated 1s (like a single 1 without any adjacent 1s forming a 2x2 block), the program will not be able to set the corresponding position in B to 1 because it relies on a fully filled 2x2 block. For example:
   ```
   Input:
   3 3
   1 0 1
   0 0 0
   0 0 0
   ```
   Here, the positions (0, 0) and (0, 2) in A cannot form any valid 2x2 block. The correct output should be -1, which is handled correctly by the program.

2. **Edge Case of Full Matrix**: If A is entirely filled with 1s (where n=2 and m=2), the program should also correctly mark all these as operations. 
   ```
   Input:
   2 2
   1 1
   1 1
   ```
   It would successfully output this as possible with one operation.

3. **No Operations Needed**: If A is entirely filled with 0s, the program correctly identifies that no operations are needed and outputs 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic of checking for 2x2 submatrices of 1s and adjusting matrix B accordingly. It handles cases of isolated 1s, entirely filled matrices, and empty matrices adequately.

Thus, after reviewing the logic and potential edge cases, we find that the program meets the requirements of the problem description under all potential scenarios.

Correctness: **True**.
