Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1). If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, then `operations` contains [(1, 1)], and `B` is a 2D list of integers (1) with dimensions n x m where `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[1][0]`, and `B[1][1]` are all 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to `operations` and `B`.***
