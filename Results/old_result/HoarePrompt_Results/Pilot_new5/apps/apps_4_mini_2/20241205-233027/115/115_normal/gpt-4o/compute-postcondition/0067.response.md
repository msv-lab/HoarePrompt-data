Postcondition: ***`B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `m` is greater than 0. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. If `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`, there is no return statement, and the function continues execution without any change in state.***
