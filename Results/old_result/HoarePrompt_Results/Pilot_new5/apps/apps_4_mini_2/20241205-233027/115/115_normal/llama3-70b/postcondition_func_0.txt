The function accepts a 2D list `A` of integers (containing only 0s and 1s) and two integers `n` and `m` (where 2 <= n, m <= 50). It checks all 2x2 submatrices of `A` for the presence of 1s. If a submatrix contains at least one 1, its top-left position (1-indexed) is added to a list. If the number of such positions exceeds 2500, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the count of unique positions and their coordinates. The function does not return a value, and the output is printed directly.
