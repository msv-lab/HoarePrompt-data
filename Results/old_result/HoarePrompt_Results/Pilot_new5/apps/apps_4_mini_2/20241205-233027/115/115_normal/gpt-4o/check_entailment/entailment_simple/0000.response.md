To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and its correspondence with the requirements outlined in the description.

### Problem Description:
1. We are given two matrices, A and B (B starts as all zeros).
2. We can perform operations on B by setting 2x2 submatrices to 1.
3. The goal is to determine if we can make B equal to A by using these operations.
4. If it is possible, we need to output the sequence of operations; otherwise, we return -1 if it is impossible.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the matrices (n and m) and then builds matrix A from the input.

2. **Matrix B Initialization:**
   - Matrix B is initialized to be a zero matrix of the same dimensions as A.

3. **Operation Execution:**
   - The program iterates over each possible upper-left corner of 2x2 submatrices in A.
   - It checks if all four elements of the 2x2 submatrix in A are 1.
   - If they are, it sets the corresponding elements in B to 1 and records the operation.

4. **Validation:**
   - After attempting to construct B, the program checks if B is equal to A element-wise.
   - If they are not equal, it returns -1, indicating that it is not possible to make B equal to A.

5. **Output:**
   - If possible, it prints the number of operations and the operations themselves.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies where operations can be performed based on the presence of 1s in the corresponding positions of A.
- It ensures that each operation performed on B corresponds to a valid operation defined in the problem description.
- The final validation checks if B matches A, which ensures that all required elements are set correctly.

### Edge Cases:
- If A contains 0s in positions that would require them to be 1s (but no 2x2 block of 1s can be formed), the program correctly identifies this and returns -1.
- If A is all zeros, the program correctly produces output of 0 operations.

### Conclusion:
The program logically follows the steps required to solve the problem as described. It handles valid cases, performs the required operations correctly, and provides the correct output format.

Thus, based on the analysis, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
