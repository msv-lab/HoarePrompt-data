To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the parameters involved in the for loop.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. This means that `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run at least once.
2. The variable `i` is initialized at 0 before the first iteration of the loop.
3. The variable `ops` is an empty list but does not directly affect the execution of the loop.
4. The state of the 2D list `A` is not explicitly needed for the loop execution because it is not referenced in the loop condition. However, `A` should be in a state that supports whatever operations will eventually be performed in the loop body.

Based on this analysis, we conclude that the following adjustments need to be made to the state:

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer from user input, `ops` is an empty list**
