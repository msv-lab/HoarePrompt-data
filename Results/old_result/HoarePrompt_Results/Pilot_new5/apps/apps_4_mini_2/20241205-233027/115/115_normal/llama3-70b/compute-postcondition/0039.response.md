Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, where `j` is less than `m - 2`. If any of the values `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, the current iteration of the loop may be skipped.***
