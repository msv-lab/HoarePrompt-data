The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `ops`, and `j` remain unchanged since `continue` does not alter them. 

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `ops` contains the additional tuple `(3, m + 1)`, `j` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
