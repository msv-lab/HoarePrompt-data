According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 0 and `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. After the current iteration completes, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration, and it must still be less than `n - 1`. Hence, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions n x m where certain 2x2 submatrices have been set to 1 based on the conditions of `A`, and `operations` includes tuples of the form `(1, j + 1)` for each valid 2x2 submatrix found in `A` that meets the specified conditions.**
