The code appends a tuple to the `operations` list. The tuple consists of the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0 and `j` is also initially 0, this results in the tuple (1, 1) being appended to `operations`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `operations` contains [(1, 1)], `B` is a 2D list of integers (1) with dimensions n x m where `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[1][0]`, and `B[1][1]` are all 1, `j` is 0**
