The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. The value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` will be 2. The value of `j` is at least 0 and less than `m - 2`, but we do not have a specific value for `j`, just that it meets these conditions. Therefore, `j + 1` will be at least 1 and less than `m - 1`.

The output state does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or `A`, but it updates the `operations` list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `B` has `B[1][j] = 1`, `B[1][j + 1] = 1`, `B[2][j] = 1`, `B[2][j + 1] = 1`, `j` is at least 0 and less than `m - 2`, `operations` has an additional value (2, j + 1) appended.**
