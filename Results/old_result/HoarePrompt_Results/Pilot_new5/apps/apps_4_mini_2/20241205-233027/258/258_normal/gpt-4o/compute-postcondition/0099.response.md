The assignment statement swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` with `x2`, `y2`, `c2`. After the execution, the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` will now be assigned the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and vice versa. 

The preconditions that remain valid after the code execution include:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a non-negative real number
- `N` is greater than `i + 3`
- `count` is less than `K`
- `j` is `i + 2`

Now, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` after the swap are as follows:
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are now equal to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2`
- `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are now equal to the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`

Thus, the output state is: 
Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`; `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are now equal to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are now equal to the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`.**
