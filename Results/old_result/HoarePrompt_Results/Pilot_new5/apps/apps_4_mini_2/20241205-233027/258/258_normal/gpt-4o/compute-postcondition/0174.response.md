The variable `cx` is assigned the value of `(x1 + x2) / 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected, but we note that `cx` now holds the average of `x1` and `x2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`**.
