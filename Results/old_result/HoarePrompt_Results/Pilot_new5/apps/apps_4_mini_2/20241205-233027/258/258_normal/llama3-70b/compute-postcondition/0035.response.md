The value of `times` is assigned the result of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The specific output of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `times`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. The state of `ans` is still dependent on its previous value and how `times[K - 1]` compares to it, but without the output of `func_2`, we can't specify further. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is -998, `y` is -999, and `times` now holds the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `times` is updated to the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`**.
