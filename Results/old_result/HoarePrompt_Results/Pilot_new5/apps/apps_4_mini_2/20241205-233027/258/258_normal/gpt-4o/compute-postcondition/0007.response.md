The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` converted to an integer to the variable `y`. The previous value of `index` is 2, so `index + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `y` will be assigned the value of `int(data[3])`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`.**
