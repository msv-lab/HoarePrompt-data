To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the conditions that affect the variables involved. 

The loop iterates over `y` from `-1000` to `1000`, and during each iteration, it computes a sorted version of the list `times`, which is derived from the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the K-th element of the sorted list `times`.

After the loop finishes executing:

- `x` remains `-998` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `y` will be `1000` after the last iteration since the loop iterates from `-1000` to `1000`.
- `times` will hold the sorted output of the last call to `func_2(-998, 1000, -998, 1000)`.
- `ans` will contain the minimum value computed from all iterations, specifically the minimum of the initial value of `ans` and all `times[K - 1]` values obtained during each execution of the loop.

For the loop to execute completely, `K` must be such that `times` has at least `K` elements, which is implicitly guaranteed if `func_2` returns a non-empty list.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is as follows:

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is 1000, `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and all `times[K - 1]` values from each iteration, `times` is the sorted output of `func_2(-998, 1000, -998, 1000).**
