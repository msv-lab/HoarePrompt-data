To determine the output state, we analyze the provided conditions and code snippet.

1. **Initial State Information**: 
   - `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`.
   - The variables `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, `d`, `cy`, and `dx` remain unchanged.

2. **Code Impact**: 
   - The code snippet assigns a new value to `my` based on the formula `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
   - The calculation for `my` involves `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. 

3. **Calculating `my`**:
   - `my` is calculated directly from the values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. 

4. **Variables Affected**: 
   - Only the variable `my` is assigned a new value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state after execution will show the updated value of `my` based on its calculation and retain the values of the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2.**
