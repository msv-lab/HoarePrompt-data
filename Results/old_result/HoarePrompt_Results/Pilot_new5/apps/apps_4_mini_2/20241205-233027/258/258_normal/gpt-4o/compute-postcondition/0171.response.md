The code `continue` does not modify any values or variables; it simply skips the current iteration of a loop. Therefore, the initial state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
