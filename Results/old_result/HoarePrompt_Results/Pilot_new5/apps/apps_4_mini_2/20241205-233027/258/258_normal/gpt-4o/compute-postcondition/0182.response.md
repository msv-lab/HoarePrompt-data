The variable `my` is assigned the value of `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. We can analyze the expression: 

- The term `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)` simplifies to `math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d))` since `d2 * d - d * d` can be factored.
- This means that `my` will be calculated as `cy - (dx * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d))) / d2`.

The states of the other variables `d`, `d2`, `mx`, and the values of `cy`, `dx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` and `d2` are real numbers; `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; my` is equal to `cy - (dx * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d))) / d2.**
