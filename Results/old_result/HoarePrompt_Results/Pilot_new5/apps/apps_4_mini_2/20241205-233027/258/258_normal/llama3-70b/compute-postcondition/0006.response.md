According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000. The variable `y` starts at -1000 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented to -999, and it must remain within the range of -1000 to 1000.

Thus, the current state for `y` needs to be updated to -999 while the other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted from the result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**
