Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition, `i` is now `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values from `meats[i]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the values from `meats[j]`, and the current value of `c1 * T` is less than the current value of `c2 * T`***
