The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates within specified constraints where `x` and `y` are integers within the range [-1000, 1000], and `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, where N is the total number of meat pieces. After executing the function body, it returns the minimum value of times[K - 1] across all pairs of (x, y) generated by the loops, with `times` being a sorted list generated from the results of another function for each pair of (x, y).

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly and returns the minimum value of times[K - 1] across all pairs of (x, y) generated by the loops, where x and y are within the range [-1000, 1000], and K is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= K <= N.**
