You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, K is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be grilled, and T is a non-negative real number representing the time threshold.
def func_1(meats, K, T):
    N = len(meats)
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]
            x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]
            if c1 * T < c2 * T:
                x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2 = x2, y2, c2, x1, y1, c1
            d = c1 * T - c2 * T
            if d < 0:
                continue
            d /= c1 * c2
            cx = (x1 + x2) / 2
            cy = (y1 + y2) / 2
            dx = (x1 - x2) / 2
            dy = (y1 - y2) / 2
            d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy
            if d * d2 > d2:
                continue
            mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
            my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
            count = sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T for x, y,
                c in meats)
            if count >= K:
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is the total number of tuples in `meats`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition across all iterations, and the loop finishes after evaluating all valid pairs; if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the return value is `True`, otherwise the return value is `False`.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that the count of tuples in 'meats' that meet the specified distance condition is less than K.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat Takahashi wants to eat such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i), `low` is approximately equal to `high`, with a difference of less than or equal to 1e-07, and `mid` is also approximately equal to both `low` and `high`. The final values of `low` and `high` will be such that `func_1(meats, K, mid)` determined the adjustments in `low` and `high` during the iterations. If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` was true in the last iteration, then `high` is the last value of `mid`; if false, `low` is the last value of `mid`.
    return high
    #The program returns high, which is the last value of mid after iterating through the adjustments based on func_1(meats, K, mid).

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), K is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be ready (1 <= K <= N), and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is the original integer value obtained from `data[0]`, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains `N` tuples of the form `(data[2], data[3], data[4]), ..., (data[2 + 3 * (N - 1)], data[2 + 3 * (N - 1) + 1], data[2 + 3 * (N - 1) + 2])`, `index` is `2 + 3 * N`.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
