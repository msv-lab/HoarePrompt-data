Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is the total number of tuples in `meats`, `count` is the sum of tuples in `meats` that meet the specified distance condition across all iterations, and the loop finishes after evaluating all valid pairs; if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the return value is `True`, otherwise the return value is `False`.**
