Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1` is assigned the previous value of `x2`, `y1` is assigned the previous value of `y2`, `c1` is assigned the previous value of `c2`, `x2` is assigned the previous value of `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is assigned the previous value of `meats[i][1]`, and `c2` is assigned the previous value of `meats[i][2]`.***
