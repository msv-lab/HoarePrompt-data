Precondition: **N is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), K is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat to be ready (1 <= K <= N), and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100.**
