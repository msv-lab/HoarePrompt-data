Initial State: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T` divided by `c1 * c2`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2)`.

Now, please think step by step: The code snippet does not provide any specific operations or assignments to variables. It simply states "continue," which implies that the program is likely waiting for further instructions or code to execute. Therefore, none of the variables are affected, nor do they change.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T` divided by `c1 * c2`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2)`.**
