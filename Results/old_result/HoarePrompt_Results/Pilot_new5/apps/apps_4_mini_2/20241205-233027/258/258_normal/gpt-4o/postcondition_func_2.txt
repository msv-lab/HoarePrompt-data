The function accepts two positive integers `N` (the number of pieces of meat) and `K` (the number of pieces to be ready), along with a list of tuples `meats` where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. It processes this input and then calls another function `func_2` with these parameters, returning a float formatted to six decimal places. However, the function does not handle any invalid input cases or exceptions that may arise from incorrect data types or values outside the specified ranges.
