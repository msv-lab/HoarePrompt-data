According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`, which is iterating through the range from -1000 to 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, the next value of `y` will be -998. The loop can continue executing as long as `y` is less than or equal to 1000.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is a sorted list resulting from `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`**
