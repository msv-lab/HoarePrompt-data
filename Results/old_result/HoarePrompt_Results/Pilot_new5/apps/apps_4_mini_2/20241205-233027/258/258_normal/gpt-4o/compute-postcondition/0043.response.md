The expression `mx` is assigned the value of `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. 

Given the initial state:
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2)`
- `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`

The calculation implies that `mx` depends on the previous values of `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`. There are no changes to the other variables in the initial state and the conditions regarding `d * d2` are not directly affecting the values in this scenario.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2)`, and `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
