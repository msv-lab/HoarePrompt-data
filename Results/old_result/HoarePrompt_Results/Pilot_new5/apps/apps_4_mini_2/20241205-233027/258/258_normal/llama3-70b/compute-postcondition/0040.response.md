The `times.sort()` function sorts the list `times` in ascending order. The previous values of `times` and other variables are not explicitly known, but we know that `times` is the output of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`. 

The values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged during the sorting process. Therefore, the output state will include the sorted version of `times`, the values of `x` and `y`, and the previous state of `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted output of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]**
