The code initializes the variable `meats` as an empty list. The previous state of `N` and `K` remains unchanged, and the list `meats` is now explicitly defined as empty, regardless of its previous state or any tuples it might have contained. Thus, the Output State is updated only for `meats`.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value obtained from `data[0]`, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is an empty list.**
