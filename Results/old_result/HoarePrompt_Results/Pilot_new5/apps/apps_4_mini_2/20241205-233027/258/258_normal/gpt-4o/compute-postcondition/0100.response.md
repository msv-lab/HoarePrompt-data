Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3`, `count` is less than `K`, and `j` is `i + 2`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are updated to the previous values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, while `x2`, `y2`, `c2` take on the previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`.***
