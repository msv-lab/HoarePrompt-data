Correctness: **False**

The given program has a flaw in the way it attempts to determine the optimal heat source placement. The program uses a brute-force search over a grid of integer coordinates from -1000 to 1000, but it assumes that the best placement of the heat source is guaranteed to be at one of these integer grid points. However, the optimal location for minimizing the grilling time could very well lie at a coordinate that is not an integer, as the problem description allows for real number coordinates for (X, Y).

For example, consider a case with the following input:

```
3 2
0 0 1
1 1 1
0.5 0.5 1
```

In this scenario, placing the heat source at (0.5, 0.5) would provide the minimum time to grill 2 pieces of meat, as it is equidistant to the first two pieces of meat, resulting in a time of 1. However, the program will search only over integer coordinates, meaning it could miss the optimal solution that lies at (0.5, 0.5) which is not an integer coordinate.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not consider all possible placements of the heat source due to its restriction to integer coordinates only, potentially leading to a suboptimal solution.
