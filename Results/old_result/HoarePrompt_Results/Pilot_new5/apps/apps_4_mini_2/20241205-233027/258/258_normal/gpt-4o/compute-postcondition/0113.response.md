The variable `my` is assigned the value of `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The variables `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d` remain unchanged, and `my` is now calculated based on their current values. The output will reflect the updated value of `my` while keeping the other variables' states the same.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 3`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2)`, `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
