Output State: **`N` is the original integer value obtained from `data[0]`, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` contains `N` tuples of the form `(data[2], data[3], data[4]), ..., (data[2 + 3 * (N - 1)], data[2 + 3 * (N - 1) + 1], data[2 + 3 * (N - 1) + 2])`, `index` is `2 + 3 * N` and `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(N, K, meats)`.**
