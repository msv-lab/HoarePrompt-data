The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`. The value of `ans` is initially set to `float('inf')`, and since `times` is sorted from the result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`, `times[K - 1]` will provide a specific float value from the sorted list. The exact value of `times[K - 1]` is not specified here, but it will be understood to be finite and less than `float('inf')`. Hence, `ans` will now hold a finite value.

The states of the other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted from the result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**.
