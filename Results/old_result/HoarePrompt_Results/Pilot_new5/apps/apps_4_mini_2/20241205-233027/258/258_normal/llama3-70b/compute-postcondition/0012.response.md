To evaluate the impact of the code snippet, we first need to understand the effect of the `times.sort()` operation on the `times` variable, which has been assigned the value from the function call `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`.

1. We know that `times` is the output of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, which is not specified in the task but must be a list or collection of values.
2. The `sort()` method will reorder the elements in the `times` list in ascending order.
3. The initial states of `x` and `y` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the code snippet.

Since we do not have the specific output of `func_2`, we will represent `times` as it is before sorting and simply note that it will be sorted. 

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted output of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`**
