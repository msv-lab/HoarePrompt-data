Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, now updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`. `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)² / 4 + (y1 - y2)² / 4`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`. If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
