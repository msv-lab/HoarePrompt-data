Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is at least `K`, `j` is `i + 1`, if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are updated to the values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` respectively, while `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are updated to the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` respectively.***
