The statement `meats.append((x, y, c))` appends a tuple containing the values of `x`, `y`, and `c` to the `meats` list. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged, but the `meats` list will now contain a new element which is the tuple `(x, y, c)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `K` is the integer value obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` now contains a tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]**.
