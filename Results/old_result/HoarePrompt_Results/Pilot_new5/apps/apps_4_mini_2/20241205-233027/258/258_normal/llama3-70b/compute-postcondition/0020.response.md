According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of values for `y` from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive). The loop can execute again as long as the current value of `y` is less than 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` will increment by 1. Therefore, `y` will be -999 in the next iteration. Since the range of `y` is from -1000 to 1000, the loop will execute again with `y` being -999.

The other variables `x`, `times`, and `ans` do not need to change for the next iteration of the loop. Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `times` is a sorted version of the non-empty list returned by `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`**
