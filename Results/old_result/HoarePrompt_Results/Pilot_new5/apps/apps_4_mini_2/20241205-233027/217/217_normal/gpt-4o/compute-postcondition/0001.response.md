The list `a` is assigned the value generated by `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes an input string of space-separated integers, converts each integer to an integer type, and creates a list from these integers. The initial state provides that `n` is an input integer that dictates the number of elements in list `a`. Thus, the length of `a` will be `n`, and each integer `a[i]` will satisfy the condition of being between -100 and 100.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100, based on the input provided.**
