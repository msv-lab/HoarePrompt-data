Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order; `b` and `c` remain unchanged; `i` is equal to `n + 1`. If `i` is even, an IndexError occurs when accessing `b` due to an out-of-bounds index. Otherwise, if `i` is odd, an IndexError occurs when trying to access `a[i]`.***
