The code calculates the sum of all negative integers in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `C`. The initial state provides that `a` contains `n` integers, each of which falls within the range of -100 to 100. The variable `B` is defined as the sum of all positive integers in `a`, but it is not affected by the current operation. 

Since `C` is being calculated based on the elements of `a`, the exact values of the elements of `a` are necessary to determine the value of `C`. However, we can state that `C` will be the sum of all negative integers in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`.**
