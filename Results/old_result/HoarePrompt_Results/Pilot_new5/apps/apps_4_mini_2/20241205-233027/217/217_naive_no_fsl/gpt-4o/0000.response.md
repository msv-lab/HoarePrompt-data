Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the difference `B - C`. 

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:** The program reads an integer `n` and then a sequence of `n` integers.
2. **Positive Sum Calculation (B):** It computes `B` as the sum of all positive integers in the sequence, which are selected for sequence `b`.
3. **Negative Sum Calculation (C):** It computes `C` as the sum of all negative integers in the sequence, which are selected for sequence `c`.
4. **Calculation of B - C:** The program then calculates the maximum possible value of `B - C`. Since `C` is negative (or zero if there are no negative numbers), subtracting `C` effectively adds the absolute value of the negative numbers to `B`, which maximizes the difference.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element:** If `n=1` and the element is negative, `B` would be `0` and `C` would be the negative value, resulting in the maximum difference being the absolute value of that negative number.
- **All Elements Non-Negative:** If all elements are non-negative, `C` would simply be `0`, and `B` would be the sum of all non-negative integers.
- **Empty Sequence:** The code correctly handles cases with empty sequences since if there are no positive integers, `B` will be `0`.

Since the program covers all cases outlined in the problem statement, it works as expected and thus is correct.
