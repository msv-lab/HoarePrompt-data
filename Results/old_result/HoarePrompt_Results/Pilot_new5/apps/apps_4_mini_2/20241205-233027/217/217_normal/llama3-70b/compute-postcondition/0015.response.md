The variable `i` is equal to `n + 1`, which means it is out of the bounds of the list `a` since `a` is defined for indices ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, attempting to access `a[i]` results in an IndexError, and the value of `b` is not updated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order; `b` and `c` remain unchanged; `i` is equal to `n + 1; b` is not updated due to IndexError.**
