According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` takes on values from 0 to `n-1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `b` and `c` are still 0, but we need to note that the loop iterates `n` times, and `i` starts at 0. Thus, before the loop starts, we need to set `i` to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is 0**
