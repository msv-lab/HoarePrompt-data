The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (each in the range -100 to 100). It sorts the list `a` in descending order and calculates the difference between the sum of integers at even indices and the sum of integers at odd indices, then prints this difference.
