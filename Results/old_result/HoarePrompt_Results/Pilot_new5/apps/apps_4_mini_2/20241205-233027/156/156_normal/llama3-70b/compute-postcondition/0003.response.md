The code `print(k + 1, 1)` outputs the value of `k + 1` and the constant `1`. The variable `k` is updated to a value less than `n - 1`, which means `k + 1` will be between `1` and `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 10^9; `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^9; `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` where `0 ≤ k < n·m`. The output is `(k + 1, 1)`.**
