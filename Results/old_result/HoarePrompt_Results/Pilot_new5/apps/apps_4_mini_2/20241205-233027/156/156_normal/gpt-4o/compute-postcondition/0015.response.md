The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Both `n` and `m` are integers constrained such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, with `n` always being even. The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained by 0 ≤ k < n·m. 

The function does not specify any output cases in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot describe specific return values or conditions based on the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an even integer), m (an integer), and k (a non-negative integer), but the return value is not specified.**
