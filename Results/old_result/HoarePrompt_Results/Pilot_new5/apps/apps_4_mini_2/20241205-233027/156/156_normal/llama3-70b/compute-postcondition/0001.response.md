The value of `k` is updated using the modulus operation with `n * 2 - 2`. Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 10^9, `n * 2` is also an even integer, and thus `n * 2 - 2` is a new integer which is also even and greater than or equal to 0. The new value of `k` will be the remainder of `k` divided by `n * 2 - 2`. Given that `k` is non-negative and less than `n * m`, the range of possible values for `k` remains valid. 

Output State: **`n` is a new even integer between 2 and 10^9; `m` is a new integer between 2 and 10^9; `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)`, where `0 ≤ k < n·m`.**
