Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases outlined by the problem description. Specifically, it fails when the number of steps `k` brings Lara to the last column and then requires her to move backwards to the previous row in the snake-like pattern.

For example, consider the input:

```
4 3 9
```

According to the problem description, Lara's path would look like this for a 4x3 matrix:

```
(1,1) --> (2,1) --> (3,1) --> (4,1) --> (4,2) --> (3,2) --> (2,2) --> (1,2) --> (1,3) --> (2,3) --> (3,3) --> (4,3)
```

If we count the moves, we find that after 9 moves, Lara should be at cell (1, 3). However, the program will output (2, 2) for this `k` value, which is incorrect. 

Thus, the program does not comply with the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
