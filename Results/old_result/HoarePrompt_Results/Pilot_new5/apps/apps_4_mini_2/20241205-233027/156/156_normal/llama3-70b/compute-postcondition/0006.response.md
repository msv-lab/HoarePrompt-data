To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is a new even integer between 2 and \(10^9\) 
  - `m` is a new integer between 2 and \(10^9\) 
  - `k` is updated to \(k \% (n * 2 - 2)\) where \(0 ≤ k < n·m\) 
  - `k` is greater than or equal to \(n - 1\) 
  - The current value of `k` is less than \(n * 2 - 2\)

Now, let's break down the calculations in the `print` statement:

1. The first value to be printed is:
   \[
   n - (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1) - 1
   \]
   - Since \(k\) is in the range (greater than or equal to \(n - 1\) and less than \(n * 2 - 2\)), we can determine the value of \((k - n + 1) \% (n - 1)\).
   - The term \((k - n + 1)\) will yield a non-negative result and will also be less than \(2(n - 1)\) because \(k < n * 2 - 2\).
   - Thus, \((k - n + 1) \% (n - 1)\) will yield some value \(r\) where \(0 ≤ r < n - 1\).
   - The first expression simplifies to:
   \[
   n - r - 1
   \]

2. The second value to be printed is:
   \[
   (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1
   \]
   - This expression computes how many complete cycles of \(n - 1\) fit into \((k - n + 1)\).
   - Given that \(k\) is at least \(n - 1\), \((k - n + 1)\) will be non-negative and can yield different values based on \(k\).

Since both values depend on the specific values of `k` and `n`, the output can be expressed with the calculated terms.

- **Output State**: 
- Let \(r = (k - n + 1) \% (n - 1)\)
- Thus, the first output will be \(n - r - 1\).
- The second output will be \((k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1\).

Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a new even integer between 2 and 10^9; `m` is a new integer between 2 and 10^9; `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)`; output values are `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`.**
