Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < `n·m`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the output is (`k + 1`, 1). Otherwise, `k` is adjusted to `k - (n - 1)`, `full_rows` is calculated as `k // (m - 1)`, and `remaining_steps` as `k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is `n - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is `n - full_rows` (which is an odd integer) and `col` is `m - remaining_steps.***
