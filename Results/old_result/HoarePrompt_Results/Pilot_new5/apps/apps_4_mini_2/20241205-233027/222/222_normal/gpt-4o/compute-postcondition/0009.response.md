The code `positions.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `positions`. The value of `n` is not directly affected, and since `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, this condition implies that `i` is at most `n - 1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `i` to `positions`. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`; `positions` now includes the value `i`.**
