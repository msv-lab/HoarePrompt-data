To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and how it addresses the task of turning over all skewers efficiently.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading two integers, `n` (the number of skewers) and `k` (the number of skewers turned on each side).
2. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `positions`.
   - The variable `i` starts at 1 and is used to track the skewer number that will be turned over.
   - In the loop, it keeps adding `i` to the `positions` list and increments `i` by `2 * k + 1`, which is the range of skewers turned over by that action.
   - This process continues until `i` exceeds `n`.

### Issues Identified
- The increment of `i` by `2 * k + 1` is intended to skip over the skewers that have already been turned. However, this logic does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned over in every case, especially when `k` is less than `n/2`.
- For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the program will turn over skewer 1, affecting skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, and will skip directly to 6, turning skewers 6, 7, which would leave skewer 5 untouched.
- The loop condition itself does not necessarily ensure that every skewer will be turned over, especially if `k` is sufficiently large and `n` is not structured in a way that allows for efficient coverage of all skewers.

### Conclusion
The program does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned over for all values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, there are cases where skewers could be left in the initial position after executing the program, which directly contradicts the problem statement.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
