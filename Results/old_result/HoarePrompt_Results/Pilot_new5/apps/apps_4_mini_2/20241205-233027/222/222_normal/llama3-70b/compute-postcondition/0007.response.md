According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `l`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `l` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute one more time. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. For the loop to continue executing, we must ensure that `l` is greater than 2. 

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `l` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is a list containing the values `[1, k * 2 + 2]`**
