The code `positions.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `positions`. The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, but does not provide the specific values of `n`, `i`, or `positions`. The other variables remain unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i`; `positions` now contains the value of `i` appended to it.**
