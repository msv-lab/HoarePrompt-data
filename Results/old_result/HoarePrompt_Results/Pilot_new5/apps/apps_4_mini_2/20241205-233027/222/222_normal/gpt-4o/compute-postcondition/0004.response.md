The value of `i` is updated by adding `2 * k + 1` to its previous value. Since `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), we can determine the new value of `i` based on the specific value of `k`. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after executing the code, `i` becomes:

- If `k = 0`, then `i = 1 + (2 * 0 + 1) = 1 + 1 = 2`
- If `k = 1`, then `i = 1 + (2 * 1 + 1) = 1 + 3 = 4`
- If `k = 2`, then `i = 1 + (2 * 2 + 1) = 1 + 5 = 6`
- ...
- If `k = 1000`, then `i = 1 + (2 * 1000 + 1) = 1 + 2001 = 2002`

Therefore, `i` can take values from 2 to 2002 depending on the value of `k`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `positions` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `positions` is [1], `i` is either 2 + 2*k (where k ranges from 0 to 1000) or specifically equal to `2 * k + 1` plus the initial value of 1.**
