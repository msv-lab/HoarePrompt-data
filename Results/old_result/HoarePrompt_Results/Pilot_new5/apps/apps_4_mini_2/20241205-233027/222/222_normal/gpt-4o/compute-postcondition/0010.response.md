The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Since we know `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, this means that after the increment, `i` will be greater than before, but `n` will still satisfy the condition of being greater than or equal to `i + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`; `positions` now includes the value `i`, and `i` is updated to `i + 2 * k + 1`.**
