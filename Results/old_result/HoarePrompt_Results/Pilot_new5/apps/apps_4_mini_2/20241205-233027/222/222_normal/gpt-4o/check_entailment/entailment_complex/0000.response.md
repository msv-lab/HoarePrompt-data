The given program attempts to solve the problem of turning over skewers efficiently. However, it has several significant issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Skewers**:
   The program generates positions using the formula `i += 2 * k + 1`. This means it increases `i` by `2k + 1` on each iteration, which does not reflect the correct way to choose the skewers that need to be turned. The problem description specifies that turning skewer `i` will affect `k` skewers on each side, implying that it should turn skewers in a sequence that covers all skewers. 

2. **Missing Essential Skewers**: 
   The program does not ensure that every skewer is turned. For example, when `k=0`, it should turn every skewer individually, but the loop's increment may skip skewers depending on the value of `k`. 

3. **Output Format and Requirements**: 
   The output is expected to show the minimum number of actions and the specific skewers to turn, but the program merely prints the length of the list of positions and the positions themselves without ensuring that all skewers are indeed turned over.

### Example of Failure:
If we take `n = 7` and `k = 2`, we need to ensure that all skewers from `1` to `7` are turned over. The expected output would require turning skewers such as `1` and `6` or similar, but the program would not necessarily output this correct solution due to its flawed logic of calculating the skewer positions to be turned.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the requirements set forth in the problem description. It fails to ensure all skewers are turned over with the fewest actions, and it does not account for the side effects of turning each skewer accurately.

Correctness: **False**
