To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `i <= n`.

1. We know that `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) and that `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000).
2. The variable `i` can either be `2 + 2*k` or `2*k + 1 + 1` (which simplifies to `2*k + 2`).
3. Given that `i` takes the form of either `2 + 2*k` or `2 * k + 2`, we can reasonably infer that `i` is an even number greater than or equal to `2` for any non-negative integer `k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, it must be true that `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, we need to consider two cases based on the possible values of `i`:

- If `i = 2 + 2*k`, then for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least `2 + 2*k` (i.e. `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`).
- If `i = 2*k + 2`, then similarly, `n` must be at least `2*k + 2`.

Since `k` is a non-negative integer that can take values from `0` to `1000`, `i` can be equal to `2`, `4`, `6`, ..., up to `2002` (increasing by 2 for each increment of `k`). 

However, since `n` is constrained to a maximum of `1000`, the highest value of `i` for which the loop can still execute must be less than or equal to `1000`. Thus, the upper bound for `k` that allows `i` to remain within the limits set for `n` is critical to establish:

1. The loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 
2. So, we require that `n` is at least `i`, which in the worst case scenario, must be `1000` because `i` could be equal to or reaching around `2000` but `i` will not exceed the maximum possible value of `n`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can run one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be at least equal to `i`, and the possible outcomes for `i` based on `k` must be set. 

Thus, we conclude:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i`**
