To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code:

1. The program reads two integers, `n` (the number of skewers) and `k` (the number of skewers turned from each side).
2. It defines a function `func_1` which aims to calculate the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers.
3. Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `positions` to keep track of which skewers will be turned.
4. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and continues while `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
5. In each iteration of the loop, `i` is added to `positions`, and then `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`.
6. Finally, it prints the number of elements in `positions` and the actual positions.

Now, let's verify if this logic correctly covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description:

### Potential Cases
1. **Case with `n = 1`, `k = 0`:**
   - Expected: 1 action (turn skewer 1).
   - The program outputs `1\n1`, which is correct.

2. **Case with `n = 3`, `k = 1`:**
   - Expected: 1 action (turn skewer 2 which turns 1, 2, 3).
   - The program outputs `1\n2`, which is correct.

3. **Case with `n = 7`, `k = 2`:**
   - Expected: 2 actions (turn skewer 1 (turns 1, 2, 3, 4) and skewer 6 (turns 5, 6, 7)).
   - The program outputs `2\n1 6`, which is correct.

4. **Case with `n = 5`, `k = 1`:**
   - Expected: 2 actions (turn skewer 2 (turns 1, 2, 3) and skewer 5 (turns 4, 5)).
   - The program outputs `2\n2 5`, which is valid.

### Edge Case:
5. **Case with `n = 6`, `k = 1`:**
   - Expected: 2 actions (turn skewer 2 (turns 1, 2, 3) and skewer 5 (turns 4, 5, 6)).
   - The program outputs `2\n2 5`, which is valid.

### Summary of Findings
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers based on the provided values of `n` and `k`. Every test case checked returns valid outputs according to the problem description.

Since all potential cases work as expected and the logic holds for the range of possible inputs, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
