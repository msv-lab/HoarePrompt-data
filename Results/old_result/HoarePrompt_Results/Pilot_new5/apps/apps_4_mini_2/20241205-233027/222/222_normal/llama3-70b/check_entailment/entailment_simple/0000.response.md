To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it in conjunction with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have `n` skewers numbered from `1` to `n` and can turn over `k` skewers on each side of the skewer being turned.
2. The goal is to find the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers and to specify which skewers to turn.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program calculates the number of actions (`l`) required to turn over all skewers using the formula:
  ```
  l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
  ```
  This formula computes how many full groups of skewers can be turned over. Each action turns over `k * 2 + 1` skewers (the skewer itself plus `k` on each side).
  
- The program then generates the list `res` containing the skewers that need to be turned. The skewers to be turned are calculated using the loop:
  ```
  for i in range(l):
      res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
  ```
  This means it appends the indices of skewers that are turned over during each action.

### Validation Against the Problem Description:
1. The calculation for `l` is correct as it accounts for how many skewers can be flipped in each action based on the proximity dictated by `k`.
2. The output of the skewers to be turned over (`res`) is also correct according to the problem description, as it systematically chooses the starting skewer of each block of `k * 2 + 1` skewers.

### Examples Validation:
- For input `(7, 2)`: 
  - Calculating `l`: `(7 + 2 - 1) // (2 * 2 + 1) = 8 // 5 = 1`, but should be `2` since you actually need to cover skewers 1-5 and 6-7. This indicates an incorrect understanding or implementation.
  
- For input `(5, 1)`:
  - Here, the calculation also falls short as it does not correctly select the skewers that would cover all initial positions, leading to potential uncovered skewers.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly cover all skewer states due to incorrect calculation of indices and the number of actions needed. Thus, it won't fulfill the requirements in all cases defined by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
