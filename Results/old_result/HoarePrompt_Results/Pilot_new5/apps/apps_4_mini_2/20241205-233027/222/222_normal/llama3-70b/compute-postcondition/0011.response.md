The code prints the elements of `res` joined by spaces. The variable `res` is a list containing `l` elements that have been defined as [1, k * 2 + 2, 2k + 3, ..., (l - 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1]. The printing operation does not change any variables but outputs the string representation of the `res` list. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged while `res` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `l` is the result of (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `i` is `l - 1`, `res` is a list containing `l` elements with values [1, k * 2 + 2, 2k + 3, ..., (l - 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1], and the value of `l` has been printed.**
