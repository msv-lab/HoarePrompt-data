The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`) are not affected, and remain valid within their given constraints. Since `years` was initially 0, after the increment, it becomes 1. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input value multiplied by 3, `b` is an integer equal to the second input value multiplied by 2, `years` is 1, and 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10 remain valid.**
