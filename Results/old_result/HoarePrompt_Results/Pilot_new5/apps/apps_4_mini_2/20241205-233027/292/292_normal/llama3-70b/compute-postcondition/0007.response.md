The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` was already defined as an integer equal to the first input value multiplied by 3, after executing `a *= 3`, the new value of `a` becomes the previous value of `a` multiplied by 3 again. 

Let’s denote the initial value of `a` as `initial_a`. Therefore, after the code executes, the new value of `a` will be `initial_a * 3`. Since `1 ≤ initial_a ≤ 10`, the range for the new value of `a` becomes `3 ≤ a ≤ 30`.

The conditions for `b` remain unchanged, as `b` must still be greater than the new value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the previous value multiplied by 3, `b` must be greater than `a`, `years` is 1, and 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10 remain valid**.
