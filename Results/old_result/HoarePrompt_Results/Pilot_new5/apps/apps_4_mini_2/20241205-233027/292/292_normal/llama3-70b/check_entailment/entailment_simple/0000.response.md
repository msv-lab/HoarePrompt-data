The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the program step by step to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the weights of Limak and Bob respectively. It ensures the condition `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10` is met as specified in the problem description.

2. **Initialization**: A variable `years` is initialized to zero. This will count the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.

3. **Weight Growth Simulation**: The program enters a while-loop with the condition `a <= b`, meaning it will continue looping as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight:
   - Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`), and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
   - The `years` counter is incremented by one for each iteration.

4. **Exit Condition**: The loop exits when Limak's weight (`a`) becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight (`b`). After exiting the loop, the program prints the total number of years it took for Limak to surpass Bob's weight.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the number of years, which matches the expected output in the problem description.

### Verification of Correct Behavior
- The program correctly implements the logic of weight changes over the years. It accurately doubles and triples the weights as described, and it counts the years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.
- It handles all given cases correctly, including edge cases where:
  - Limak and Bob start with equal weights (e.g., `1 1`).
  - Limak's initial weight is less than Bob's but grows faster due to the tripling effect (e.g., `4 7` or `4 9`).

### Conclusion
Since the program adheres to the problem requirements and correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
