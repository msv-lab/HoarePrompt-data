The variable `years` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The variables `a` and `b` remain unaffected, but the information about them is still valid as per the initial state description. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `years` along with the unchanged conditions of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to its previous value multiplied by 9; `b` is greater than the previous value doubled; `years` is 3; `b` is now double its previous value.**
