The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. The initial state indicates that `a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, where `b` is between `a` and 10. This means that `a` could be any integer from 1 up to `b`, and after the multiplication, `a` will become three times its original value. The variable `years` remains unchanged at 0. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10, and `a` is now 3 times its original value.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10, `a` is now 3 times its original value, `years` is 0.**
