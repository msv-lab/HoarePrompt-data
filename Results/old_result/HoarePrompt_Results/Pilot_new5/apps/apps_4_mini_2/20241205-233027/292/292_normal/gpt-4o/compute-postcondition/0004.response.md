The value of `b` is doubled. Since `b` is an integer between `a` (which is now 3 times its original value) and 10, its new value will be at least 6 and at most 20. The values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 20, `a` is now 3 times its original value, `years` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 20, `a` is now 3 times its original value, `years` is 0.**
