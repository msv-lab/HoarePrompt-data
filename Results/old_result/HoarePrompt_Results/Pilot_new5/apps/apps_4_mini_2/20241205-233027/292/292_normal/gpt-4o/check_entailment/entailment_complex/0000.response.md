Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s how it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers, `a` and `b`, representing the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. The constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) ensure that the weights are always within the specified range.

2. **Weight Growth Logic**:
   - In the loop, Limak's weight `a` is tripled each year (`a *= 3`), and Bob's weight `b` is doubled each year (`b *= 2`). This reflects the problem description that states Limak's weight grows by a factor of 3 annually, while Bob's grows by a factor of 2.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues executing as long as Limak’s weight is less than or equal to Bob’s weight (`while a <= b:`). This ensures that the calculation continues until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight, which meets the requirement of determining when Limak becomes "strictly larger" than Bob.

4. **Counting Years**: The variable `years` is incremented with each iteration, counting the number of full years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight, aligning perfectly with the output requirement.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program outputs the total number of years it took for Limak to become heavier than Bob.

The provided program logically follows the problem description and correctly performs the required calculations for all valid input cases defined by the constraints. Therefore, it operates correctly for the specified scenario and adheres to the requirements.
