The function accepts no parameters and reads two integers, `a` and `b`, from input, representing the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively, where `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`. It then calculates the number of years required for Limak's weight (tripled each year) to exceed Bob's weight (doubled each year) and prints this number of years. The function assumes valid input according to the specified constraints, and does not handle any cases where the input may be invalid.
