The provided code defines a function that calculates the number of years required for Limak's weight to surpass Bob's weight, adhering to the given problem description. The logic in the code correctly implements the weight change dynamics:

1. Limak's weight triples each year (`a *= 3`).
2. Bob's weight doubles each year (`b *= 2`).
3. The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight (`while a <= b:`).

The initial assessment suggests that the code correctly follows the problem description for the ranges specified (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10). It handles the requirement of Limak needing to become strictly larger than Bob and increments the year count correctly.

Examining the provided examples:
- For input `4 7`: After 2 years, Limak's weight surpasses Bob's (resulting in an output of 2), which is correct.
- For input `4 9`: After 3 years, Limak's weight surpasses Bob's (resulting in an output of 3), which is correct.
- For input `1 1`: After 1 year, Limak's weight becomes 3, which is greater than Bob’s weight of 2 (resulting in an output of 1), which is correct.

Now, let's analyze the output hints:
- The hints accurately describe the function’s purpose and implementation, confirming that it computes the number of years required for Limak to surpass Bob’s weight.

Given that:
1. The code implements the logic as described in the problem statement.
2. It has been tested against various edge cases provided in the examples, and all provided scenarios yield the expected results.

There do not appear to be any edge cases that the code fails to handle within the specified input constraints.

Correctness: **True**.
