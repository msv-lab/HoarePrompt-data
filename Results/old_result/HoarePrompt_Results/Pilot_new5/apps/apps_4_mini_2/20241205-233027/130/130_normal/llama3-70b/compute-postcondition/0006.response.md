The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it returns a value based on the relationships between the integers N, M, K, and L, which are constrained by the conditions given (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18). The exact output behavior isn't specified in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can only be summarized in terms of its lack of parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters.**
