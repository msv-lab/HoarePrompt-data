The value of `min_x` is assigned the result of the expression `(L + M - 1) // M`. Since `M` and `L` are integers and are between 1 and 10^18, the result of the expression is guaranteed to be an integer, and it represents the minimum number of complete segments of size `M` needed to cover a total length of `L`. The states of the other variables `N`, `K` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`N`, `K` are integers assigned new values from input, where 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= M, L <= 10^18; `min_x` is calculated as (L + M - 1) // M.**
