The code `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the method `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`, which means `input` will now refer to this method instead of the built-in `input()` function for reading user input. The values of the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers such that 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18 and 1 <= M, L <= 10^18; `input` now refers to `sys.stdin.read` method.**
