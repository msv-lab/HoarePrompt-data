To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**: We have four integers:
   - `N`: Total different collectible coins.
   - `M`: Number of Ivan's friends.
   - `K`: Number of collectible coins Ivan already has.
   - `L`: Minimum number of new coins from the gifts.

2. **Requirements**:
   - Each friend must give the same number of coins.
   - All coins given must be unique.
   - At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

3. **Key Considerations**:
   - After accounting for the coins Ivan already has (`K`), the total number of new coins available to gift is `N - K`.
   - The total number of unique coins given by `M` friends must not exceed `N` (i.e., `M` must be less than or equal to `N - K + 1`).
   - At least `L` coins must be new, which means `M` must be greater than or equal to `L`.

### Analyzing the Program:
The program checks two conditions:
- `M >= N - K + 1`: This checks if the number of friends is enough to give the maximum number of unique coins considering the coins Ivan already possesses.
- `M >= L`: This checks if the number of friends can provide at least `L` new coins.

### Correctness Check:
- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints `1`, indicating that each friend can gift exactly one coin.
- If either condition fails, it prints `-1`, indicating it is impossible to satisfy the gifting terms.

### However:
The implementation has a mistake in interpreting the problem:
- The first condition `M >= N - K + 1` is not correct because it does not ensure that the friends can gift enough unique coins. The program suggests that `M` should be greater than or equal to `N - K + 1`, implying that if `M` friends can give that many coins, they could all gift unique coins (which is not necessarily true).
- The second condition `M >= L` is valid as it checks for the minimum number of new coins needed.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to appropriately handle cases where the total number of friends exceeds the available coins, and does not account for situations where the unique coin count is not satisfied. 

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
