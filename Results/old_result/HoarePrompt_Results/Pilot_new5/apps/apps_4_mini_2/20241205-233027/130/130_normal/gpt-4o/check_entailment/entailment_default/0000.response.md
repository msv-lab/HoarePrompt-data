To assess the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze both the code and the potential edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of coins each friend must give to Ivan such that:
1. All friends gift the same number of coins.
2. All coins gifted must be different.
3. At least L of the gifted coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Code Analysis:
The code computes the minimum number of coins `min_x` each friend must give as follows:
1. It calculates `min_x` using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is a way to compute the ceiling of `L/M`. This gives the minimum number of coins needed from each friend to ensure L new coins are contributed collectively.
2. It then checks if the total number of coins given by all friends (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the number of coins available that are not already in Ivan's collection (`N - K`).
3. If this condition is satisfied, it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
1. **Case where M is greater than N**: If the number of friends (M) is greater than the number of different coins (N), it's impossible for all friends to gift different coins. The code does not explicitly handle this case. For example, with `N = 10` and `M = 11`, the output should be `-1`, which is handled by the condition checking `M * min_x <= N - K`.
   
2. **Case where L is greater than the total number of available coins**: If `L` is greater than `N - K`, it implies that there are not enough coins left to satisfy the requirement of new coins. This would lead to an incorrect situation if `min_x` were calculated in such a case. The current code does not check whether `N - K < L` directly, which could lead to returning a positive `min_x` when it should return `-1`.

3. **Extreme values**: The algorithm must handle cases with maximum constraints, e.g., `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` all being up to `10^18`. Python's integers can manage this, but logical checks need to be sound.

### Output Hints:
The output hints suggest the logic behind the code seems reasonable as it expresses that the minimum `min_x` must not cause the total gifts to exceed the available new coins after accounting for what Ivan already owns. 

### Conclusion:
While the code executes correctly for a number of scenarios, it fails to address specific edge cases concerning the relationship between `M`, `N`, and the new coins needed `L`. Particularly, it does not directly handle the situation where `L > N - K`, which can lead to a condition where the program incorrectly prints a positive quantity of coins when there are not enough available to meet the minimum new coin requirement.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
