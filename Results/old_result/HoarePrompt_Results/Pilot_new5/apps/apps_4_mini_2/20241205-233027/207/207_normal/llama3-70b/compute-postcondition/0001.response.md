The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. The value of `m` is an input positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9. The states of the other variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5; `b` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with all elements set to 0.**
