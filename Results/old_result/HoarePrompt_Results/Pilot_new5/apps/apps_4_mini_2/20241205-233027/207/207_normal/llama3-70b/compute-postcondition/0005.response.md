The value of `dp[i + a]` is updated by adding `dp[i]` to it. Since `i` is initially 0, the calculation becomes `dp[0 + a] += dp[0]`. The value of `dp[0]` is 1, so we are effectively adding 1 to `dp[a]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and we know that `i + a` is still less than or equal to `m`. The updated state reflects `dp[a]` having increased by 1.

Output State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9, `a` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5, `b` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[a]` is 1 (increased by 1), `i` is 0.**
