Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, where `dp[0]` is 1, and for each index `i` (1 <= `i` <= `m`), `dp[i]` is the sum of `dp[i - b]` for all valid indices `i - b` and the number of ways to reach index `i + a` from index `i`, which adds `dp[i]` to `dp[i + a]` if `i + a <= m`. If the loop does not execute, then `dp` remains unchanged with `dp[0]` as 1 and all other elements as 0.**
