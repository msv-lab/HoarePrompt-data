According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `i` in the range from `0` to `m`, inclusive. This means that, at the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to `0` (the first value in the range). The state of `m`, `a`, and `b` does not affect the execution of the loop in terms of whether it will run, since `m` is guaranteed to be a positive integer and the loop is defined to accommodate `m + 1` iterations (from `0` to `m`). 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are that `i` starts at `0`, and we need to ensure that `dp` has been properly initialized as defined.

State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9, `a` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5, `b` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, where `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0**
