To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the functions along with the problem description and output hints.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach based on its jumping capabilities on a number line, where it starts at position 0. The frog can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`, and we need to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`, where `f(i)` is the number of distinct integers that can be reached within the bounds `[0, i]`.

### Function Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(x, y)` 
This function calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The behavior of this function is straightforward and correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm.

**Output Description Confirmation:**
- It correctly describes the GCD calculation.
- It notes the edge case where if `y` starts as 0, it will return `x` immediately. This is a valid consideration as it could demonstrate a situation where `y` is not provided, leading to potential errors, but since both `a` and `b` are positive integers according to the constraints, this edge case won't occur based on the input.

#### Function 2: `func_2(m, a, b)`
This function determines the reachable integers based on the input values:
- It first obtains the GCD (`g`) of `a` and `b`.
- If `g` is not equal to `1`, it recursively scales down `m`, `a`, and `b` by their GCD.
- It defines `k` as `a + b - 1` and checks if `m < k`. If so, it computes the triangular number for `m`.
- If `m >= k`, it computes two sums: one up to `k` and another from `k` to `m`.

**Output Description Confirmation:**
- It correctly describes the recursive nature based on the GCD.
- The distinction between the cases where `m < k` and `m >= k` is also properly articulated.

### Edge Case Analysis
1. **GCD Calculations**: The recursion when `g != 1` seems reasonable; it reduces larger numbers by their GCD which simplifies the problem.
  
2. **When `m < k`**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where `m` is less than `k`, returning a simple triangular number which is valid.
  
3. **When `m >= k`**:
   - The logic for summing integers up to `m` is acceptable. However, we should ensure that while calculating the sums, the conditions of position boundaries are maintained correctly.

### Output Hints Verification
The output description provided for both functions matches the functionality implemented in the code. However, a potential concern arises from how the functions handle edge cases, particularly when `m` could be very small compared to `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion
The program appears to handle the expected cases and edge cases correctly based on the problem statement and the output hints. The GCD function doesn't introduce errors, and the frog's jumping logic seems sound. 

There doesn't appear to be a case where the program would fail according to the provided input constraints and the problem description, as all paths through the code lead to valid outputs.

Thus, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
