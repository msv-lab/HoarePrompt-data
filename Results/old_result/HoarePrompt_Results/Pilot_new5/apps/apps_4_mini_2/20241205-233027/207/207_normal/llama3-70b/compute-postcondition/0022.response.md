The function `func` does not accept any parameters as defined in the provided code snippet. However, it works with the constraints that `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\) and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). The output of the function is not specified in the provided details, so we cannot determine the exact return value or logic at this point. 

Since there are no defined output conditions, we cannot specify the functionality of the function based on the available information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters; the functionality and return value are not specified.**
