The function accepts non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, representing cell coordinates in a rectangular pond of size `n Ã— m`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net. It returns the area of the scoop-net's coverage based on the provided coordinates, dimensions, and scoop-net size, but it assumes that the variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are defined elsewhere in the code. If any of these variables are not properly defined or passed into the function, it could lead to an error or incorrect output.
