`heap` will have a new tuple pushed onto it. The tuple consists of three elements: the first element is the negative coverage value calculated by `coverage(x, y)`, while the last two elements are the values of `x` and `y`, which are 2 and 0 respectively. The original state of `heap` remains unchanged in terms of its tuple count, but it will increase in terms of total content due to the new tuple being added. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains `2m + 1` tuples, `x` is 2, `y` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` must be greater than 0**
