You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Annotated Functions:
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond, r is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop, and k is a positive integer representing the number of distinct fishes to be placed in the pond such that k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5).
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `heap` contains `n * m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each `x` in the range `0` to `n - 1` and `y` in the range `0` to `m - 1`; `n` and `m` must be positive integers.
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `heap` contains `n * m - k` tuples of the form `(-coverage(a, b), a, b)` for `a` in the range `0` to `n - 1` and `b` in the range `0` to `m - 1`; `total_coverage` is equal to the sum of the coverage values of the `k` popped tuples; `k` must be less than or equal to `n * m`.
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the average coverage per position, calculated as total_coverage divided by total_positions, where total_coverage is the sum of the coverage values of the k popped tuples and total_positions is equal to (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four positive integer parameters: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), `r` (size of the scoop), and `k` (number of distinct fishes). It calculates the total coverage by summing the coverage values of the `k` most covered positions in a grid defined by `n` and `m`, and then returns the average coverage per position based on the total coverage divided by the total number of valid positions for the scoop, which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. If `k` exceeds the total positions in the grid, it could lead to an error since the number of fishes should not exceed `n * m`. The function does not explicitly handle this edge case.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing cell coordinates within a rectangular pond of size n × m, where 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m; n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond; r is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net such that r <= min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns the area of the scoop-net's coverage on the pond, calculated using the coordinates (x, y), dimensions (n, m), and scoop-net size (r).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, representing cell coordinates in a rectangular pond of size `n × m`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net. It returns the area of the scoop-net's coverage based on the provided coordinates, dimensions, and scoop-net size, but it assumes that the variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are defined elsewhere in the code. If any of these variables are not properly defined or passed into the function, it could lead to an error or incorrect output.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
