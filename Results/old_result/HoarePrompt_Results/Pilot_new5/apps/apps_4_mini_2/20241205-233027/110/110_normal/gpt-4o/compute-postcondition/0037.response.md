The value of `total_positions` is calculated as \((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)\). The initial conditions of `heap` and `total_coverage` are not directly affected by this calculation, but the result of the expression for `total_positions` is dependent on the values of `n`, `m`, and `r`. The output state will reflect the updated value of `total_positions` based on these variables.

Output State: **`heap` contains `n * m - k` tuples of the form `(-coverage(a, b), a, b)` for `a` in the range `0` to `n - 1` and `b` in the range `0` to `m - 1`; `total_coverage` is equal to the sum of the coverage values of the `k` popped tuples; `k` must be less than or equal to `n * m`; `total_positions` is equal to \((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)\**
