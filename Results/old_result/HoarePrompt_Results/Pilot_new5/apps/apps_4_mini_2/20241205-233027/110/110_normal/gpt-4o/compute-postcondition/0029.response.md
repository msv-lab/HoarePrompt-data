The variable `cov` is assigned the value `-coverage(x, y)`, which implies that `cov` is a positive value if `coverage(x, y)` is non-negative. The variable `total_coverage` is decreased by the value of `cov`, which is equivalent to increasing `total_coverage` by the value of `coverage(x, y)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `heap` contains `n * m - 1` tuples of the form `(-coverage(a, b), a, b)` for `a` in the range `0` to `n - 1` and `b` in the range `0` to `m - 1`; `total_coverage` is now `total_coverage + coverage(x, y)`; `k` must be greater than 0; `cov` is `-coverage(x, y)`; `x` is the x-coordinate popped from the heap; `y` is the y-coordinate popped from the heap.
