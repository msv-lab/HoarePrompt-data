#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), f is a non-negative integer representing the number of days chosen for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and days is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (k_i, l_i) representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for each day (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples that contains exactly `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing `n` values where each value is `min(k_i, l_i)` for each day, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing `n` values where each value is `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each day.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns total_sales, which is the sum of regular_sales and the sum of the first f elements of potential_sales_increase
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `f`, and a list of tuples `days` where each tuple contains two integers representing the number of products and clients for each day. It calculates `regular_sales` as the minimum of products and clients for each day and `potential_sales_increase` as the potential additional sales if the products could double. The function returns the total sales, which is the sum of all regular sales and the largest `f` potential sales increases.
