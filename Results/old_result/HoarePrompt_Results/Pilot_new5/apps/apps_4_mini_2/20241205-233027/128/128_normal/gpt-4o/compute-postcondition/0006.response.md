The code `regular_sales.append(min(k, l))` adds the minimum of `k` and `l` to the `regular_sales` list. The previous values of `regular_sales` remain unchanged, but now a new value is appended.

Since `regular_sales` is defined as `min(k, l)`, after the execution of the code, `regular_sales` will include this new value as an additional element.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples that must contain at least 2 tuples, `regular_sales` now includes an additional value `min(k, l)`**.
