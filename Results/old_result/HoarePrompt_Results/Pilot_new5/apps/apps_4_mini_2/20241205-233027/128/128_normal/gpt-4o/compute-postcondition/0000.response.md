The variable `regular_sales` is initialized as an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `f` is a non-negative integer representing the number of days chosen for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (k_i, l_i) representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for each day (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9), and `regular_sales` is an empty list.
