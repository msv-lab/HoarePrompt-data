The variable `total_sales` is assigned the value of the sum of `regular_sales`, which is a list containing `n` values where each value is `min(k_i, l_i)` for each day. Therefore, `total_sales` becomes the total of these minimum values over the `n` days. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples containing exactly `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing `n` values where each value is `min(k_i, l_i)` for each day, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing `n` values where each value is `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each day, `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`.**
