In the code snippet, the variables `k` and `l` are assigned values based on user input, which means their values are updated based on what is provided during execution. The previous values of `k` and `l` are unknown due to the input nature, but they will now hold integer values based on the user's input. The rest of the variables remain unchanged and valid under the given conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `_` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, and `days` now contains the tuple (k, l) appended to its previous elements.**
