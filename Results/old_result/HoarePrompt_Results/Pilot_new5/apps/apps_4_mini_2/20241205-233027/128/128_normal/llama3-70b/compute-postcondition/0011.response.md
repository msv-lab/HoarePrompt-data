The loop takes `n` iterations to append a tuple `(k, l)` to the list `days` for each day in the shop's plan. The values of `k` and `l` are input integers provided during each iteration.

If the loop executes `n` times, the following states will be true:

1. `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of days.
2. `f` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= f <= n`.
3. `_` will be `n - 1` after the final iteration.
4. There will be `n` tuples in the `days` list, each containing the respective `(k, l)` inputs from each iteration.

If `n` is `0`, the loop does not execute, and the `days` list remains empty.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` contains `n` tuples of input integers `(k, l)`.**
