To determine the correctness of the provided Python program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic against the requirements.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Palindrome Check**: The core requirement is to find the longest substring of the string `s` that is not a palindrome. 
2. **Output Conditions**:
   - If `s` itself is not a palindrome, the output should be the length of `s`.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, the program should check substrings: 
     - By removing the first character.
     - By removing the last character.
   - If any of those substrings are not palindromes, return their lengths (which will be `len(s) - 1`).
   - If all possible substrings are palindromes, return `0`.

### Program Logic Breakdown

1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of whitespace.
2. **Single Character Case**: 
   - If the length of `s` is 1 or less, it correctly identifies that `0` should be returned since a single character is always a palindrome.
3. **Palindrome Checks**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome.
   - The main logic first checks if the string `s` is a palindrome.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints its length directly.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it checks the substrings formed by removing the first (`s[1:]`) and the last character (`s[:-1]`). If either of these substrings is not a palindrome, it prints `len(s) - 1`.
   - If both substrings are palindromes, it correctly returns `0`.

### Correctness Assessment

- The program correctly identifies the longest non-palindromic substrings and obeys the conditions laid out in the problem description.
- It accurately handles edge cases including strings of length 1 and all characters being the same.
- The logic follows the requirement to find a non-palindromic substring, or return `0` when none exist.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
