The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50, `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50**.
