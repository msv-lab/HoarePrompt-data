`max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value (which could be 2 or based on its last value) and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr`, which is `s[2:4]`, is always 2 since it slices the string `s` from index 2 to 4 (not inclusive). Since `max_len` is either its previous value or 2, the new value of `max_len` will be at least 2, but it may retain its previous value if that value is greater than 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50; `n` is greater than or equal to 4; `substr` is `s[2:4]`; `max_len` is either its previous value or 2, and the new value of `max_len` is either its previous value or 2; `i` is 2; `j` is 4.**
