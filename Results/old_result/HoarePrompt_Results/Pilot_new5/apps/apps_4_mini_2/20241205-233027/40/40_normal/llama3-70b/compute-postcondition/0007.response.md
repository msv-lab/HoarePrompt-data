The code `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))` updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum between its current value and the length of `substr`. Given that `substr` is the first character of `s`, its length is 1. Therefore, the updated value of `max_len` will be the maximum between 0 (its initial value) and 1 (the length of `substr`). The maximum is 1. 

The values of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is the first character of `s`, and `substr` is not equal to its reverse.**
