`max_len` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is defined as `s[2:4]`, its length will be 2, assuming `s` has at least 4 characters. Given that `max_len` is at least 1, the new value of `max_len` will be the greater of its previous value and 2. Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible values of `max_len` based on its previous state. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is either its previous value or 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `substr` is the substring `s[2:4]**
