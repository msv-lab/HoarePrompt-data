The code assigns a new value to `max_len` based on a comparison between its current value and the length of `substr`. The `substr` is derived from the string `s` and has a length of `3` (since it is `s[1:4]`, which includes the characters at index 1, 2, and 3). The `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `3`.

Given that `max_len` remains unchanged in terms of the output state until this operation occurs, the only variable that changes is `max_len`. The initial state of the other variables remains valid.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with length at most 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `max_len` is updated to max(max_len, 3), `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `substr` is now `s[1:4]**.
