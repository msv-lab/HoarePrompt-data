The code initializes a dictionary `in_degree` where each key is an integer from 1 to `n`, and each value is set to 0. The `graph` variable is not affected by this code. The previous values of the affected variable are now known. 

Thus, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from each vertex; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to n has a value of 0.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from each vertex; `in_degree` is a dictionary {1: 0, 2: 0, ..., n: 0}.**
