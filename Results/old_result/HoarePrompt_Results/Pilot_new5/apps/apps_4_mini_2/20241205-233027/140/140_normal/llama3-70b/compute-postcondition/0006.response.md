Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` must have at least one neighbor in `graph[node]`, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, and for at least one neighbor of `node`, `visited[neighbor]` is False. The function `func_1` returned False for the neighbor of `node`, indicating that either the neighbor has been visited or does not lead to a cycle.***
