Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`; `graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices and values are lists of integers representing directed edges from each vertex; `u` is each vertex in `graph` during the iteration.**
