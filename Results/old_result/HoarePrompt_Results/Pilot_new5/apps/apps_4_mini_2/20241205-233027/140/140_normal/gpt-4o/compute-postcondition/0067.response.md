Postcondition: ***`in_degree[v]` is defined for all vertices `v` in `graph`, `queue` contains at least one neighbor of `node`, `count` is increased by 1, `node` is a valid vertex in `graph`, `graph[node]` must have at least 1 neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decreased by 1, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.***
