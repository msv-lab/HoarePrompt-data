Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` must have at least one neighbor in `graph[node]`, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, and for every neighbor of `node`, `visited[neighbor]` is True. The current value of `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True for the neighbor being considered.***
