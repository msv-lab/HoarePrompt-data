Postcondition: ***`in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, except for `in_degree[neighbor]`. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is zero, `neighbor` is added to `queue`, `count` is set to 1, and `node` is assigned the value of a valid node from `queue`.***
