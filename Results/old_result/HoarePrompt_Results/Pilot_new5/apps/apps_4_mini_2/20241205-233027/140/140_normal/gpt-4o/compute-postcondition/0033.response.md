Postcondition: ***`in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, except for `in_degree[neighbor]` which is decreased by 1; `graph` is a dictionary where `node` is a key and has at least one neighbor; `queue` is not empty before the popleft; `count` is 1; `node` is assigned the value of a valid node from `queue`. The current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.***
