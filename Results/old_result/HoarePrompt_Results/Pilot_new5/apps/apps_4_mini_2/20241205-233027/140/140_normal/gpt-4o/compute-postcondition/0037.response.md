The line of code `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decreases the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` by 1. The initial state specifies that `in_degree[v]` represents the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, except for `in_degree[neighbor]`. 

Since `in_degree[neighbor]` is part of the `in_degree` list and is being decremented, the only variable being modified is `in_degree[neighbor]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, except for `in_degree[neighbor]`; `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1.**
