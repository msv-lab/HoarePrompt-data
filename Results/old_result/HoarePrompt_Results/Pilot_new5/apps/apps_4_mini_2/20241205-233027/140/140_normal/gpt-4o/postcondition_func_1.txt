The function accepts a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph, where keys are integers (vertices) and values are lists of integers (edges). It determines whether the graph contains a cycle by checking if the total number of processed nodes (count) equals the total number of vertices (n). It returns True if there is a cycle, indicated by `count` being not equal to `n`, and False if there is no cycle, meaning all nodes were processed successfully. The function is designed to handle graphs with 2 to 500 vertices.
