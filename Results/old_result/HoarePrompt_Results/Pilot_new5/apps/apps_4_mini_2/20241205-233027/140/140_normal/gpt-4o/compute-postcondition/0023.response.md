The statement `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Since `v` is the third vertex in `graph[u]`, the previous value of `in_degree[v]` will now be `in_degree[v] + 1`. The other variables remain unaffected based on the given initial state.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least 4 vertices, `u` is the third vertex in `graph`, `graph[u]` must contain at least 3 vertices, `in_degree[v]` is now the previous value of `in_degree[v] + 1`, `v` is the third vertex in `graph[u]`.**
