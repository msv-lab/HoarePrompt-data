Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `count` is increased by 1; `in_degree[v]` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v` for all vertices `v` in `graph`, `queue` no longer contains the previously leftmost neighbor, `node` must correspond to a vertex in `graph` that has at least 1 neighbor.**
