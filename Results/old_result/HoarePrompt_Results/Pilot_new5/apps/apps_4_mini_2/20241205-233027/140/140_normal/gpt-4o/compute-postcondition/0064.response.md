The variable `count` is incremented by 1. The values of `in_degree[v]`, `queue`, and `node` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree[v]` for all vertices `v` in `graph` is equal to the total number of incoming edges directed to vertex `v`; `queue` must contain at least one neighbor of `node`; `count` is increased by 1; `node` is now the vertex that was removed from `queue`.
