The value of `dx` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`operations`, `op`, `dy`, `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 1, `op` is the next operation from the `ops` list, `dy` is the current value, `dx` is decreased by 1, `res` is the current value. 

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 1, `op` is the next operation from the `ops` list, `dy` is the current value, `dx` is decreased by 1, `res` is the current value.**
