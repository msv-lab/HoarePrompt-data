`dy` is assigned the value of `y - final_y`. The value of `final_y` remains undetermined in this context, but `dy` will be the difference between `y` and `final_y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`.**
