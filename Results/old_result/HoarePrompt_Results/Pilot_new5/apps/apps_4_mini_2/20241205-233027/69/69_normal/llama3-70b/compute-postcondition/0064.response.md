The value of `dy` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`operations`, `op`, `dx`, and `res`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 1, `op` is the next operation from the `ops` list, `dx` is the current value, `res` is the current value, and `dy` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 1, `op` is the next operation from the `ops` list, `dx` is the current value, `res` is the current value, `dy` is increased by 1.**
