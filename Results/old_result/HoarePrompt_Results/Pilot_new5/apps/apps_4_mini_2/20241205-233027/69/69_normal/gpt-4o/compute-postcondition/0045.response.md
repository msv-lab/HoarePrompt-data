The code snippet initializes a dictionary named `position_map` with a single key-value pair, where the key is the tuple `(0, 0)` and the value is `-1`. This action does not alter any of the existing variables or their values in the initial state; it simply defines a new variable. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that a new variable `position_map` has been added, while the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the sum of increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is set to positive infinity; `current_x` is 0; `current_y` is 0; `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}.**
