The value of `final_y` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `final_y` was 0, so after this operation, `final_y` becomes -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, and the character `op` is 'D'.**
