Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the sum of the increments and decrements from 'R' and 'L', respectively; `final_y` is equal to the sum of the increments and decrements from 'U' and 'D', respectively; `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, and `y` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9. If the loop does not execute (e.g., if `n` is 0), then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 0.**
