Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 0, `op` is the first character in `operations`, `op` is either 'L' or not 'U', `dy` is less than or equal to 0, and it is not the case that `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0; `dx` is less than 0. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is now at least 0. Otherwise, `res` is increased by 1.***
