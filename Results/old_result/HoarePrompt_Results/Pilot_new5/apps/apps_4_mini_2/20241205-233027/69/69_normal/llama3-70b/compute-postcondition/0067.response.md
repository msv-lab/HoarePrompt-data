The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`operations`, `op`, `dy`, `dx`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res`.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` greater than 1, `op` is the next operation from the `ops` list, `dy` is the current value, `dx` is the current value, `res` is the previous value incremented by 1.**
