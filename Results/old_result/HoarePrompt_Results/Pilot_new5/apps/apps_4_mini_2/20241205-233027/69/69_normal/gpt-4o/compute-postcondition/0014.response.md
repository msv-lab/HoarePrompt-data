Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is any integer within the range -10^9 <= y <= 10^9. If the character `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is updated to 1 and `final_y` remains 0.***
