The value of `ux` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `operations` is a string of length `n` with at least `i + 2` characters, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, but the new value of `ux` is not specified. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `operations` is a string of length `n` with at least `i + 2` characters, `op` is the character at index `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `ux` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length `n` with at least `i + 2` characters, `op` is the character at index `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `ux` is increased by 1.**
