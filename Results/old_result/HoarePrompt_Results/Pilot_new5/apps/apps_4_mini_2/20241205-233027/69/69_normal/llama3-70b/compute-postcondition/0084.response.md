Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length `n`. If `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, `-1` is returned. Otherwise, `dy` represents the net vertical movement after executing all valid 'U' and 'D' operations, and `dx` represents the net horizontal movement after executing all valid 'R' and 'L' operations; `res` is the count of operations that did not result in any movement, and its value has been printed, with `x` and `y` remaining unchanged, alongside `lx` and `ly`.***
