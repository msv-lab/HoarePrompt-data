The initialization of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` sets their values to 0. Since there are no previous values for these variables, we directly assign them the values mentioned. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `n` is an input positive integer; `ops` is an input string; `x` and `y` are now assigned new input integer values; `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0**.
