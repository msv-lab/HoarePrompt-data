Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a string `operations` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the final position based on the operations and returns 0 if the final position matches `(x, y)`. If not, it calculates the minimum length of valid paths in the operations that would return to the position `(x, y)`, returning this length if found, or -1 if no such paths exist. The function handles the scenario where no operations are performed and ensures that if `n` is 0, it will return -1 as there are no movements possible. **
