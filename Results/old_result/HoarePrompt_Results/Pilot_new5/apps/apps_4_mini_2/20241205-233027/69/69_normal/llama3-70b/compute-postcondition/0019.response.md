Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'; `ops` is a non-empty input string where `op` is the first character. If `op` is 'U', `uy` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'D', `uy` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', `ux` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'L', `ux` is decreased by 1. The values of `x`, `y`, `lx`, and `ly` remain unchanged in all cases.***
