Postcondition: ***`operations` is a string of length `n` that is greater than 0, `op` is the first character in `operations`, `op` is not 'U', `dy` is less than or equal to 0, and it is not the case that `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0 (meaning either `op` is not 'D' or `dy` is greater than or equal to 0).***
