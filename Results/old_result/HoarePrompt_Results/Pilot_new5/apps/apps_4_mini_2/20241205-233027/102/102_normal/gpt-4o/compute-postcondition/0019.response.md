The code snippet `print(x, y)` outputs the values of `x` and `y`. The variables `x` and `y` retain their previously defined values. Given the initial state, `x` is 2, and `y` is calculated as `(n - 2 * a) // b`, where `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * a`.

The output does not change the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, or `y`, but it does produce output. The specific values of `x` and `y` are printed, but since we do not have specific values for `a`, `b`, or `n`, we cannot provide exact numerical outputs for `y`. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is greater than or equal to 2 * a; `x` is 2; `y` is (n - 2 * a) // b; output is 'YES' and it prints (2, (n - 2 * a) // b)**
