The command `exit()` is a function that halts the execution of the program. No variables are modified or returned as a result of this command, and all other states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes have occurred to the variables, but the program has terminated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; `x` is 2; `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b` and the program has terminated.**
