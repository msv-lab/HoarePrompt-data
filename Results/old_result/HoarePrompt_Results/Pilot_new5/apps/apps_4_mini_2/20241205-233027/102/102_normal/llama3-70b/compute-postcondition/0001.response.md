The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input value and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000,000, and `b` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000. The specific value of `a` will depend on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000**
