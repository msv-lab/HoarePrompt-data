`y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. Given that `x` is 1, this simplifies to `y = (n - a) // b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and the condition that `((n - a) % b) != 0` remain unchanged. The relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b` implies that `y` will be a non-negative integer since `n - a` is not divisible by `b`, suggesting that the result of the floor division will be less than `((n - a) / b)`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`; and ((n - a) % b) is not equal to 0.**
