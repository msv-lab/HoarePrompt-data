The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. All three parameters are integers with the constraint that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10,000,000\). 

After executing the function body:
- Case 1: The function returns nothing and simply completes its execution without returning any specific value.
- Case 2: The function returns nothing as there is no value specified to be returned.
- Case 3: The function returns nothing explicitly, but it indicates 'YES' and prints the tuple (2, (n - 2 * a) // b), where '2' is a constant and \(y\) is calculated as \((n - 2 * a) // b\), based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, and based on the execution path, it may complete without returning, return nothing explicitly, or indicate 'YES' while printing a specific tuple derived from the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters n, a, and b, and may either complete execution without returning anything, return nothing, or print 'YES' along with the tuple (2, (n - 2 * a) // b).**
