The variable `y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. 

Given the constraints:
- `n - x * a` is a multiple of `b`, so `(n - x * a) % b == 0`.
- `x` is `0`, hence `n - x * a` simplifies to `n`.

Thus, `y` becomes `n // b`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `x` is 0; `y` is `n // b`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `n // b`.**
