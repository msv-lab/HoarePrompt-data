Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; `x` is an integer in the range from 0 to `n // a`; `y` is an integer determined by the expression `(n - x * a) // b` for each `x`. The loop will either exit when a valid pair `(x, y)` is found such that `x * a + y * b = n`, or it will complete all iterations without finding such a pair, resulting in no output and the initial values of `x` and `y` being unmodified.**
