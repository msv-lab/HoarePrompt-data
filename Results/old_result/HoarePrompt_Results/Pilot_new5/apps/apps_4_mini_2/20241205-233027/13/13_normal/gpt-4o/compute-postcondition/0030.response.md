The value of `start` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state mentions that `n` is greater than 3 and does not provide any information about `i`. Therefore, `i` is unknown, but `start` will hold that unknown value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `start` is equal to `i`.**
