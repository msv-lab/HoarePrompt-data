According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `left`, `right`, and the condition that `s[left]` must not be 'G'. At the end of the last iteration, `left` has been increased by 1, and `right` is still greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be less than `right` and `s[left]` must not be 'G'.

Since `left` has already been increased by 1, to ensure the loop can execute again, we must confirm that `left < right` still holds true. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `s[left]` must not equal 'G'. 

There is no information about the value of `s[left]` at the end of the previous iteration, but we need to ensure that it is not 'G'. Therefore, we can adjust the condition of `s[left]` to ensure it does not equal 'G'. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is increased by 1, `right` is greater than 0, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'**
