The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1. The values of `n` and `trophies[5]` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `trophies[5]` must be 'G', variable `i` is increased by 1**.
