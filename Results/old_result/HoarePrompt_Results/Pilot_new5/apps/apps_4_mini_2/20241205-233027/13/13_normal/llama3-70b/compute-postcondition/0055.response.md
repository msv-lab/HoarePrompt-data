The variable `max_beauty_one_swap` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this code, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's at the end of the string, `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s` or equal to `n` if no 'G' is found, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0.
