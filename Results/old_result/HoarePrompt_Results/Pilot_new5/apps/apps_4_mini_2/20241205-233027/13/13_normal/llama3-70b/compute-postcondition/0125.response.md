According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit of the range, `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n - 2`, which means that for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. This means that in the next iteration, `i` will become `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must still be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, after the next increment, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

In summary:
- `i` at the end of the last iteration: less than `n - 2`
- After incrementing `i`: it will be less than `n - 1` (which is still valid for the loop)

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`
- The condition of `i` still being less than `n - 1` holds true, since it was previously less than `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is at least `i + 2`, and `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G'.**
