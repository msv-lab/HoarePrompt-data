The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be at least 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 1, `j` is 0, and `s[j]` is not 'G'; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
