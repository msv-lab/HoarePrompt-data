Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is at least `i + 2`, and `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G'. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters starting from `s[i-1]` down to `s[0]` plus the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i + 2]` to the last 'G' character before a non-'G' character is encountered. Additionally, `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.***
