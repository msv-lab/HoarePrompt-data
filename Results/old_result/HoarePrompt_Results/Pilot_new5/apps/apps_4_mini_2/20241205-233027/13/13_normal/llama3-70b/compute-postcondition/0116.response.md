The execution of the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it terminates the most internal loop or conditional statement that it is enclosed within. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
