The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State will retain the previous conditions for `n`, `i`, and `j`, while updating the value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, `beauty` is increased by 1.**
