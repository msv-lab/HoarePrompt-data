According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -1. The loop starts at `j = i + 2`, so we need to calculate the new value of `j`.

Given that `i` is less than `n - 2`, the minimum value of `i + 2` is 2, which means `j` starts at 2. Since the loop will execute one more time, we need to consider that `j` will be incremented by 1 after the last iteration, making `j` equal to 2.

Now, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` must be 2 (the next value after the last iteration of -1). Since `n` is at least 2 and could be as much as 100000, `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is 2, and `s` is a string of 'G's of length at least `i + 1`.**
