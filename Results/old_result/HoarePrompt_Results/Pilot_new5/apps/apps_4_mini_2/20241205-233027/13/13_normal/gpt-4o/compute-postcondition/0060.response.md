Postcondition: ***`max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the computed length from segments if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2. `prev_start` is set to `segments[1][0]`, `prev_end` is set to `segments[1][1]`, `curr_start` is equal to `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` is equal to `segments[2][1]`, `i` is 2, and `len(segments)` is greater than 2. If `curr_start - prev_end` does not equal 2, `max_length`, `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, `curr_end`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
