According to the code, the for loop iterates from `i - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Since the initial state indicates that `i` is less than `n - 1`, the smallest possible value for `i` is `1` (because `n` is at least `2`), which means `i - 1` would be `0`.

Given that in the current state, `i` is less than `n - 1`, the state must ensure that `i` is at least `1` for the loop to run. The variable `j` will start at `i - 1` and decrement down to `0` in each iteration.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we can summarize the necessary conditions:
- `i` should be at least `1` (to ensure `i - 1 >= 0`).
- The starting value of `j` should be `i - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `i - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `beauty` is 1**
