The variable `segments` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `n` and `trophies` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the new definition of `segments`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list.**
