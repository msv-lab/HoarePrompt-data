The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. There are no previous values provided for `beauty`, so it will simply be `beauty` + 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be at least 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `s[j]` must be valid for `j = i - 2`, and `beauty` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be at least 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `s[j]` must be valid for `j = i - 2`, and `beauty` is increased by 1**.
