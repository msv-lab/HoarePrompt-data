`beauty` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `beauty` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `beauty` is increased by 1.**
