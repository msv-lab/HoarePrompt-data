According to the code, the loop iterates from `i - 1` down to `0`. The current value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `i - 1`, and it will decrease by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `-1`. The loop can execute again as long as `j` is not less than `0`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be at least `1`, which means `j` is currently `i - 1`. Given the constraints that `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', it indicates that the loop is checking elements in the string `s` in reverse order.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be set to `i - 2` (decrementing from `i - 1`), and `s[j]` must still exist within the bounds of the string `s`, which requires that `j` is non-negative.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` must be at least 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `s[j]` must be valid for `j = i - 2`**
