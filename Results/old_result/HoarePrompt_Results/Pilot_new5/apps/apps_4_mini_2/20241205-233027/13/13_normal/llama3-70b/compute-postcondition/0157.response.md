The line of code `max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)` updates the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `beauty`. The other variables remain unaffected.

- The value of `max_beauty_one_swap` depends on its previous value and the current value of `beauty`.
- The variable `beauty` is already defined as equal to `i + 1` plus the number of consecutive 'G's in `s` starting from index `i + 2` up to but not including `n`.

Thus, after executing the code, the output state will still include the constraints on `n`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and the definition of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is at least `i + 1`, `s` is a string of 'G's of length at least `i + 1`, `beauty` is equal to `i + 1` plus the number of consecutive 'G's in `s` starting from index `i + 2` up to but not including `n`, stopping at the first non-'G' character or at index `n`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.**
