The code assigns values to `prev_start` and `prev_end` from the tuple located at index `i - 1` of the `segments` list. The values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` will depend on the specific tuple at that index. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing segments of 'G's, `max_length` is the maximum length of segments of contiguous 'G's, and `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at `segments[i - 1]`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at `segments[i - 1]`.**
