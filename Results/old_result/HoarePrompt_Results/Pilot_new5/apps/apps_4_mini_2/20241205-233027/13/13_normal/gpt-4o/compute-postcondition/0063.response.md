Output State: **`max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the computed length from segments if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2; `prev_start` is set to `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is set to `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` is equal to `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is equal to `segments[3][1]`, `i` is 3, and `len(segments)` must be greater than 3.**
