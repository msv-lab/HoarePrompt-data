Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` remains as it was initially, and `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[right]` is 'G'. If `s[right]` is not 'G', then `left` is equal to the first index of 'G' or `right`, `s[left]` is 'G' if `left` is not equal to `right`, otherwise `s[left]` must not be 'G', and if `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is increased by 1.***
