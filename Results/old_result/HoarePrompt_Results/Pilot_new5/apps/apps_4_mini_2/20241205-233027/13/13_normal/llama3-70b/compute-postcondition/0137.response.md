According to the code, the loop iterates backwards from `i - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been set to `i - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `i - 2 - 1`, which is `i - 3`. 

Additionally, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i - 3` is still greater than or equal to `0`, which implies that `i` must be at least `3`. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
1. `j` becomes `i - 3` for the next iteration.
2. The condition for `i` remains that it is at least `1`, but for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least `3`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 3, `j` is `i - 3`, and `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G'.**
