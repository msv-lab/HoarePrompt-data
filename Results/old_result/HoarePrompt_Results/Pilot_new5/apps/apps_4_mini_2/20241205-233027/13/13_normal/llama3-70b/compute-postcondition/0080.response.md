According to the code, the loop is dependent on the variable `j` which starts at `i + 2` and continues until it is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n - 2`, meaning that `j` must be at least 3 (since `j = i + 2` and `i` is at least 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`, which implies that `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

Since `j` is currently `i + 2`, after the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to set `j` to `i + 3`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least `i + 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n - 2`, `j` is at least `i + 3`**
