The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Given that `left` must be greater than or equal to 0 and `s[left]` must not equal 'G', incrementing `left` still keeps `s[left]` valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is increased by 1, and `right` is greater than 0.
