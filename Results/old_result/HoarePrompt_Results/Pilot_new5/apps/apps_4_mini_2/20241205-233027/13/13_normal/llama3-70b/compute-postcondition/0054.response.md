The code updates the value of `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr_beauty`. The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `curr_beauty`, and `left` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `max_beauty` based on the comparison between its current value and `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is an input string, `golden` is a list of indices where 'G' occurs in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's at the end of the string, `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s` or equal to `n` if no 'G' is found.**
