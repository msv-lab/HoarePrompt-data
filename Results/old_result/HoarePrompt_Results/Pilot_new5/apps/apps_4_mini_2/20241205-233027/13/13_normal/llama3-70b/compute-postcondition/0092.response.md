The value of `beauty` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `s` is a string where all characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]` are 'G', `j` is at least `i + 2` and less than `n`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, while `beauty` is now `1`.
