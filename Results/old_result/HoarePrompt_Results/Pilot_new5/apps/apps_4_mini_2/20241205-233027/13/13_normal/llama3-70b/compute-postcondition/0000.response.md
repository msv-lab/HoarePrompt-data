The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will now hold an integer value that is read from the input. The previous condition that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000` remains valid and unchanged. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and `n` is an input integer**
