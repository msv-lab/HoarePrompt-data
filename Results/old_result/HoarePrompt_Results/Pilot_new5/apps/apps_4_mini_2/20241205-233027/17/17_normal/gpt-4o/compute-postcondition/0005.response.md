The code snippet provided simply prints the value `1`. It does not modify any variables or affect the state of the existing variables. The preconditions remain intact, as there are no changes to the values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4`, `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, or `cnt4`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and acknowledges the action taken by the print statement.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers; `cnt1` is a non-negative integer input; `cnt2` is an input integer; `cnt3` is an input integer; `cnt4` is an input integer; the value 1 has been printed.**
