The variable `rated` is assigned the value `True`. Since there are no other changes to the state of the other variables, they remain as they were before. The previous values of `rated`, `unrated`, `maybe`, `n`, `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are unchanged except for `rated`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers, `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`, `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`, `rated` is True, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True, `i` is 1**
