The variable `is_unrated` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. The conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `ratings[i - 1][0]` being less than `ratings[i][0]` is still valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]`, `is_unrated` is True**.
