The variable `ratings_after` will have `b` appended to it. The initial state indicates that `ratings_after` is a list containing `b`, and after the operation, it will now contain an additional element, which is `b`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1001; `ratings_before` now includes `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing `b` and `b` has been appended to it.**
