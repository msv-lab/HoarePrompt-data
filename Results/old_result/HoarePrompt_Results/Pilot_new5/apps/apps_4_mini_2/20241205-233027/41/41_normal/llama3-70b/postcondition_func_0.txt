The function accepts no parameters and processes the ratings of `n` participants (where `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000). It reads ratings before and after a round for each participant. The function determines whether the ratings are 'rated' (if any participant's rating has changed), 'unrated' (if the ratings before and after are the same for all participants), or 'maybe' (if there is an inconsistency in the ratings where some participants have increased ratings before and decreased afterwards). It outputs one of the three results based on these checks.
