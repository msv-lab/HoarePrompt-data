The code snippet takes input values for `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are integers parsed from a single line of input. The variables `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing the values of `a` and `b`, respectively. The initial state of `n` is not affected by this code directly, but it remains valid as it is still in the range specified (2 <= `n` <= 1001).

After executing the code, `a` and `b` have been assigned values from user input, which will subsequently populate the lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1001; `ratings_before` is a list containing `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing `b`; `a` and `b` are input integers.**
