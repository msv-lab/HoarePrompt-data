Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists containing `n` integers. If `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `ratings_before[i]` is equal to `ratings_after[i]`, no changes occur to `rated` and the execution continues.***
