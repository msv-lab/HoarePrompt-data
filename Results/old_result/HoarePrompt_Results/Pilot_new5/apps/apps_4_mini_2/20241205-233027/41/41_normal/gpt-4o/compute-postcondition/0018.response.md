The variable `is_rated` is assigned the value `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, there are no changes to the values of the variables or the state of the program.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1001; `ratings` contains the original tuples plus the new tuple (a, b); `is_rated` is True; `is_unrated` is False; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.**
