Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integers; `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integers; `a` is the last integer for `ratings_before`; `b` is the last integer for `ratings_after`; `rated` is False; `unrated` is False; `maybe` is True; `i` is 0; `j` is `n-1`. If there exists any `j` in the range from `1` to `n-1` such that `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` will be set to False. If no such `j` exists, `unrated` remains True.**
