Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1000, `unrated` is `False`, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `unrated` is False. If `unrated` is True, the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `ratings_before`, and `ratings_after` remain unchanged from their initial states.***
