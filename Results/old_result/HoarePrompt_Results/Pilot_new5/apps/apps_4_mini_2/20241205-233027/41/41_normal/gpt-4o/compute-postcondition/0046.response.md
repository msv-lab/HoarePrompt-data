The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on inputs that adhere to specified constraints. The function expects the following:

- An integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\), representing the number of participants.
- For each participant, two integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) such that \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 4126\), representing the ratings before and after the round respectively.

After executing the function body, it processes these inputs based on the described constraints. The output is not explicitly stated in the provided information; thus, we cannot describe the return value.

Functionality: **The function processes ratings for `n` participants, where ratings before and after are constrained by specified limits, but does not return any value directly as it takes no parameters.**
