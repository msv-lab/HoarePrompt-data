The code appends the tuple `(a, b)` to the list `ratings`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and continues to satisfy the condition `3 ≤ n ≤ 1001`. The variables `is_rated` and `is_unrated` are also unchanged, remaining `True` and `False` respectively. The values of `a` and `b` do not change as they are used directly in the append operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1001; `ratings` contains the original tuples plus the new tuple (a, b); `is_rated` is True; `is_unrated` is False; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer.**
