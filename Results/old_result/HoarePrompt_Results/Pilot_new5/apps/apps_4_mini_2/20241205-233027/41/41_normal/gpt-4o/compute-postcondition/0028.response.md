The variable `is_unrated` is assigned the value `True`. The previous states of the variables indicate that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and `i` is 2. The condition regarding `ratings[i - 1][0]` and `ratings[i][0]` is unchanged. The values of the other variables remain the same, but the value of `is_unrated` is now `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `is_unrated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
