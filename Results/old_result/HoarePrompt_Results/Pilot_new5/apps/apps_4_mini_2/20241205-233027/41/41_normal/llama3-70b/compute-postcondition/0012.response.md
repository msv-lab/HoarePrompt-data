The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input. The variable `ratings_before` still includes `a`, and `ratings_after` is updated to include the new value `b`. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, as no operations modify it directly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 1001; `ratings_before` includes `a`; `ratings_after` includes the new value `b` appended to it; `a` and `b` are input integers.**
