The function processes ratings for `n` participants, where each participant has a rating before and after a round. It determines if the ratings are "rated" (if any participant's before and after ratings differ), "unrated" (if the before ratings are not strictly increasing when all after ratings are equal), or "maybe" (if the ratings are all equal and not strictly increasing). The function does not return any values directly, as it takes no parameters.
