According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 3 and `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, meaning `i` will be at least 4. Additionally, `n` must still be at least 4 to ensure the loop can continue executing.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 4, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its original value and the sum of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for all `j` where `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`.**
