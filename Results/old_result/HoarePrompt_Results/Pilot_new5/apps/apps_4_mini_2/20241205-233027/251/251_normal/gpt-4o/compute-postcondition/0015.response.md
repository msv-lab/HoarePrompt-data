According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. Given that `i` is at least 1 and must be less than `n`, this means that the loop has executed at least once with `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still less than `n` (specifically, `i` being 1 or more). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, which will make `i` equal to 2 after the next iteration. 

Since `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), the loop can continue as long as `i` is still less than `n`. 

Thus, the state adjustments are:
- `i` increments by 1, and the new value of `i` is 2.
- `n` remains the same, still indicating that the loop can execute while `i < n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `i` is 2; `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` contains the maximum volume sum of cakes whose volumes are less than `volumes[i]`, with `dp[0]` equal to `volumes[0]` and all other `dp[k]` for k > 0 reflecting the computed values based on the comparisons made during the loop.**
