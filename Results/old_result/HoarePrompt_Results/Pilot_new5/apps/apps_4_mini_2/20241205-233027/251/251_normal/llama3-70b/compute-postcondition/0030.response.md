According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from `0` to `i-1`. Since `i` is at least `3`, the loop can execute at least once, starting with `j = 0`.

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `j` would be `i - 1`. Thus, for the loop to be executed correctly, `j` should start from `0`. 

The state before the loop starts indicates that `j` is at least `i - 1`, which means `j` could be `2` if `i` is `3`. Hence, we need to adjust `j` for the loop to be properly initialized.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 0, `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` remain as `cakes[0][0]` and `cakes[1][0]` respectively, `cakes` must have at least `n` elements.**
