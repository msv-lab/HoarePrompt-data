According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute `i` times, starting from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`. Given that `i` is at least 4, the loop can execute. The state of `j` should be initialized at the start of the loop. 

Thus, before the loop begins, the values should be adjusted to reflect that `j` starts at 0, and we have already established that `i` is at least 4. Since `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, we are not making any changes to those variables as they are part of the initial conditions.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 4, `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, `j` is 0**
