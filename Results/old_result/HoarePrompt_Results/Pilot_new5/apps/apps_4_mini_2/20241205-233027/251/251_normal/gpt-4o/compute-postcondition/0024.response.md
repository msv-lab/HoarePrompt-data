According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `i`. The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `i-1`. Given that `i` is currently `2`, the loop has executed for `j = 0` and `j = 1` in the previous iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` would increment to `2`, which is equal to `i`. Since the range for `j` is from `0` to `i-1`, this means the loop will not execute again after this point.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the loop cannot execute again with the current values. However, if we are only focused on what the adjusted state would be for the next iteration, we would note the increment for `j`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
