Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 0, `dp[0]` is `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`, and if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`.***
