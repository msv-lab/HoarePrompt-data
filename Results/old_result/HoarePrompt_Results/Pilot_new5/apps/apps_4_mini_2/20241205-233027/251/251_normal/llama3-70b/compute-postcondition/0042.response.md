The statement `dp[i] = cakes[i][0]` assigns the value of `cakes[i][0]` directly to `dp[i]`. The initial condition indicates that `dp[i]` was previously determined by the maximum value between its original value and the computed sum involving `dp[j]` for certain indices `j`. However, after executing the code, `dp[i]` is explicitly set to `cakes[i][0]`, which overrides its previous value.

Since `dp[i]` is now assigned the value of `cakes[i][0]`, we need to keep track of the new value while also maintaining the initial conditions surrounding `n`, `i`, and the relationships among the `cakes` array.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 4, `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`**
