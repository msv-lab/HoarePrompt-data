Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `i` is at least 2; `j` is 1; `cakes` is a list of tuples (r_i, h_i) with (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000); `volumes` is a list of computed volumes. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `volumes[i]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged, with `dp[0]` equal to `volumes[0]` and all other `dp[k]` for k > 0 remaining zeros.***
