According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`, and since `i` is at least `3`, the next value for `j` would be `1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `1`, and since `i` is at least `3`, the loop can further check if `j` is less than `i`. The conditions for updating `dp[i]` would still apply since `cakes[i][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` need to be compared with `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[j][2]`.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 1, `dp[0]` is `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`, and if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[1][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[1][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and `dp[1] + cakes[i][0]`.**
