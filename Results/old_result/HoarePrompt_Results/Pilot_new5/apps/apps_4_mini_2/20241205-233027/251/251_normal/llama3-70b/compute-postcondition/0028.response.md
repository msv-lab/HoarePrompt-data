According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n` and the current value of `i`. The loop runs while `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is at least 2 at the end of the last iteration, to execute again, `i` would be increased to at least 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4 (because `i` must still be less than `n`).

Thus, adjusting the states for the next iteration:
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 3, `j` is at least `i - 1`, `dp[i]` is the maximum value computed based on the comparison of `cakes[i][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` with the preceding `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[j][2]`, and `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` remain as `cakes[0][0]` and `cakes[1][0]` respectively. `cakes` must have at least `n` elements.**
