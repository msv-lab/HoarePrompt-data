Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 4, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value achievable based on the conditions checked against all previous cakes. The value of `dp[i]` is equal to the maximum of its initial value and the sum of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for all `j` where `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`. The values of `dp` at indices less than `i` remain unchanged unless they influence the value of `dp[i]`.**
