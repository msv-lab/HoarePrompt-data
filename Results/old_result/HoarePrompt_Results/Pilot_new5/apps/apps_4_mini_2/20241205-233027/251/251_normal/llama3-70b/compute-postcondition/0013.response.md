The variable `dp` is assigned a list of zeros, with the length equal to the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100,000, `dp` will be a list containing `n` elements, all initialized to `0.0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `cakes` is a sorted list of (volume, radius, height) in descending order by volume; `dp` is a list of length `n` initialized to all 0.0**
