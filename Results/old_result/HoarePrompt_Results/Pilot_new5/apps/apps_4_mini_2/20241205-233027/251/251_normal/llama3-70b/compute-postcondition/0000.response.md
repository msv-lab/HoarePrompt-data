`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial condition for `n` being a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 remains valid. Other variables related to the cakes (`r_i` and `h_i`) are not affected by this line. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `r_i` and `h_i` are described by integers (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000)**
