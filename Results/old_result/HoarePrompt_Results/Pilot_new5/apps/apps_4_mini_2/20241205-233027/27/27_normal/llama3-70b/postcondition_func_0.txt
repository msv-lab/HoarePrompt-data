The function accepts three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input and computes various exponentiation combinations of these numbers. It then identifies which combination yields the maximum value and prints the corresponding expression as a string (e.g., 'x^y^z'). The function does not return any values; it only prints the result. It assumes that the input numbers are within the specified range and have one decimal place, but it does not perform any error handling for invalid inputs.
