Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements set out in the problem description. 

Here are the issues:

1. **Expression Handling**: The expressions are calculated correctly, but the output format contradicts the problem statement. The problem requires the expressions to be printed exactly as specified (e.g., `x^y^z` without parentheses for the first case, and `(x^y)^z` for the specific case where parentheses are needed). The program does not ensure that the output matches the format specified in the problem description when there are multiple maximums.

2. **Printing the Maximum Expression**: While the program does find the maximum value, it does not differentiate properly between cases where two or more expressions have the same maximum value. The problem states that the smallest index (from 1 to 12) should be outputted in the case of ties, but the program uses the built-in `max()` function directly on a list of tuples, which does not account for multiple maximums appropriately due to how it selects the first maximum found.

3. **Function Calls and Imports**: The program uses `sys.stdin.read` without importing `sys`, which will lead to an error when running the program.

In summary, while the program is structured to compute the required expressions, it fails to adhere to the output format specifications of the problem description and does not correctly handle cases of multiple maximums, making it incorrect.
