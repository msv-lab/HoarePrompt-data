The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the integer square root of `n`, checking for divisibility and adjusting the value of `res` based on the conditions specified. 

If `n` is a perfect square, `res` will be decreased by 1 during the iteration where `i * i` equals `n`. For each divisor found within the loop, `res` is incremented by 2, representing both the divisor and its complement (i.e., `n / i`). If `n` is not divisible by `i`, `res` remains unchanged for that iteration. 

After all iterations are complete, `res` ultimately holds the total count of divisors of `n`. The loop will execute a maximum of `int(n ** 0.5)` times, and if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute at all.

Output State: **`res` is equal to the total number of divisors of `n`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9.**
