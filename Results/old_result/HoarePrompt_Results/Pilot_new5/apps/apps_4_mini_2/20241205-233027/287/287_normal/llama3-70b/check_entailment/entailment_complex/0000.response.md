Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires counting the different weights of splits of a positive integer \( n \), while the program calculates and prints the total number of divisors of \( n \).

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Understanding of Splits and Weights**: The problem requires finding the number of different weights of all possible nonincreasing splits of \( n \). The weight of a split is determined by how many times the first element appears in the split. The program, however, does not consider the concept of splits at all; it solely counts the divisors of \( n \).

2. **Incorrect Computation**: The logic implemented in the `func` does not correspond to the logic needed to find the weights of splits. Specifically, the loop iterates over potential divisors rather than constructing or analyzing any splits.

3. **Output Mismatch**: The expected output is a single integer representing the count of distinct weights, while the program outputs the count of divisors, which is unrelated to the problem at hand.

In summary, since the program does not perform the necessary operations to comply with the problem description regarding the weights of the splits, it is deemed incorrect.
