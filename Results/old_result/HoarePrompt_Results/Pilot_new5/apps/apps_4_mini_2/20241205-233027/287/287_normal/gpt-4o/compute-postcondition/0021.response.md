`i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 2, it is now 3. The value of `count` remains unchanged at 0. The condition regarding `num` being divisible by 2 and its effect on `count` and `i` does not impact the current state because the code only involves updating `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is at least 4, `count` is 0, `i` is now 3.

Output State: **`num` is at least 4, `count` is 0, `i` is 3**
