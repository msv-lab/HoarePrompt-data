The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after the execution, the new value of `count` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is at least 4, `count` is 1, `i` must be 2.

Output State: **`num` is at least 4, `count` is 1, `i` must be 2**
