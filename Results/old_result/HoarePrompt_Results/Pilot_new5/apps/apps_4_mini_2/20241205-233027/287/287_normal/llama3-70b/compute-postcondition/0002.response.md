According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if the range from 1 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` contains at least one integer. Since `n` is a positive integer, the smallest value for `n` is 1, which results in the range being from 1 to 2 (inclusive) for the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed:
- The variable `i` must start at 1.
- The value of `n` must be such that `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 1, which is satisfied by any positive integer `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `res` is still 0, and `i` will have the value of the last integer in the range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**
