The variable `res` is incremented by 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as its bounds still hold, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` which implies that `i` is now one unit greater than its previous value, while still being less than or equal to `int(n)`. Hence, the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and `res` is incremented by 2.**
