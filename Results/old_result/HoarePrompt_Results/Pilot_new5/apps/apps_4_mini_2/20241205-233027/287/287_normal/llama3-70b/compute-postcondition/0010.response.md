The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res + 2`, which means `res` is incremented by 2. The initial conditions state that `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, but `res` is updated with its new value and remains unchanged prior to this operation as a variable. The value of `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `res` is updated to `res + 2**.
