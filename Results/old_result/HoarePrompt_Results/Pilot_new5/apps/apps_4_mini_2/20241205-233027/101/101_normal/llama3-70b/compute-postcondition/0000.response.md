The values of `n` and `m` are now assigned from the input, which consists of two integers. The conditions mention that both `n` and `m` are within the range of 1 to 2000, but the actual values will depend on the user's input. Therefore, we do not know the exact values of `n` and `m` after execution but can confirm they are integers that will be set based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000**
