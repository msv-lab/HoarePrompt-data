The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. The previous value of `i` is 0, so both `top` and `bottom` will now also be 0. Other variables remain unchanged, particularly `right`, which may still hold the previous value depending on `j`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `m` must be greater than 1; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; `top` is 0; `bottom` is 0; `left` remains 0; `right` is updated to the value of `j` if `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`; `i` remains 0; `j` is 1.**
