The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 2. The other variables `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as the condition of `i` being greater than `bottom` is not satisfied (since `i` is 0 and `bottom` is also 0).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `left` is 2**.
