The code creates a list comprehension, `white_pixels`, which generates a list of tuples `(i, j)` for each position in the `pixels` grid where the corresponding entry is equal to the string `'w'`. The values of `n` and `m` determine the range for the indices `i` and `j`. The variable `pixels` remains unchanged, but `white_pixels` will now hold the coordinates of all white pixels found in the `pixels` list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, and `white_pixels` is a list of tuples containing the coordinates of the entries in `pixels` that are equal to `'w'`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples containing the coordinates `(i, j)` for each `pixels[i][j]` that is equal to `'w'`.**
