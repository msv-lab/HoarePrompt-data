Postcondition: ***`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `j` is `left + 2`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is at least `left + 2`. If `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left`, or `j` is equal to `right`, then if `result[i][j]` is '.', `result[i][j]` is assigned the value '+'; otherwise, there is no change to `result[i][j]`.***
