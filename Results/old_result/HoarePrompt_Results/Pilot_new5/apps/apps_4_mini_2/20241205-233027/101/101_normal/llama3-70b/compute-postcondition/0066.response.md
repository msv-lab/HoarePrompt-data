According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2. Since `n` can be at least 2 (it is between 1 and 2000), `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, and for each column `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `pixels[i][j]` is either '+' (if the corresponding conditions were satisfied during its iteration and it was originally '.'), remains 'w' (if it was 'w'), or is set to '.' (if it was neither '+' nor 'w').**
