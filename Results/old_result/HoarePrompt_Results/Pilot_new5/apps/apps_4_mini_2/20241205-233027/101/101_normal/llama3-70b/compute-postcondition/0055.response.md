The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there are no changes made to any variables and there is no exit from the loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state only notes that the control flow continues without any modification to the state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
