The value of `top` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that the current value of `i` is 0 and that `top` was not previously set to any value (it is None), now `top` will equal 0. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the character at position `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and the current value of `i` is less than 0.**
