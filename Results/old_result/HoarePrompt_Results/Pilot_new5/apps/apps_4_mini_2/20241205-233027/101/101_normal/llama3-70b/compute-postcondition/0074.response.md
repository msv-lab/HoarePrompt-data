The operation `pixels[i][j] = '.'` assigns the value `'.'` to the specific position in the `pixels` 2D array at the indices `[i][j]`. Given the initial state, we know that:

1. `n` is between 2 and 2000 (this variable is not affected).
2. `i` is 2 (this variable is not affected).
3. `m` is greater than 0 (this variable is not affected).
4. `j` is 0 (this variable is not affected).
5. Other conditions are not changed; specifically, it is still not the case that `i` equals `min_x`, `i` equals `max_x`, `j` equals `min_y`, `j` equals `max_y`, or `pixels[i][j]` equals '.', and also `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to 'w'.

The only change is that `pixels[i][j]` is now `'.'`. 

Therefore, the output state after this operation will be:

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `pixels[i][j]` is '.'**.
