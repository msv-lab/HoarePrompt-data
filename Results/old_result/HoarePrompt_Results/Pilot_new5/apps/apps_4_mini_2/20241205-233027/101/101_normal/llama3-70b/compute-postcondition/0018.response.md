According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer between 1 and 2000, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, we need to consider the initial state of the loop variable `i`. At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to 0, which is the default starting index for a zero-based index range in Python.

Given the current states, we can summarize the adjustments needed for the loop to execute properly:

- `n` is already defined as being between 1 and 2000, which is sufficient for the loop to execute.
- `i`, which is the loop index, should be initialized at the start to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0**
