The code snippet initializes a list called `pixels` which holds `n` entries, where each entry is generated by calling `input()` to read a string. Since `n` is between 1 and 2000, it indicates that `pixels` will contain between 1 and 2000 lists of input strings. The values of `m` and `n` remain unchanged, while the `pixels` variable is now defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings.**
