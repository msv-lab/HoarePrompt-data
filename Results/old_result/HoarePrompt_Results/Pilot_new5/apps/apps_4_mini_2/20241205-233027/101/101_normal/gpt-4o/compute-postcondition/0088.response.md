The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `top` remains unchanged as there are no conditions affecting it in this operation. The values of `left` and `right` also remain unchanged if `i` is less than `top`. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `bottom`, while the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `j` is `k + 2` (where `k < m - 2), top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is `i`, and `left` and `right` remain unchanged.**
