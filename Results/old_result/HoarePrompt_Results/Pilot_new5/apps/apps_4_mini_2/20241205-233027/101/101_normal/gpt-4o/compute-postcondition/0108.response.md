The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that initially `i` is 1 and it is now greater than `bottom`, `bottom` will be updated to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`top` is equal to 1; `bottom` is 1; `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w'; `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w'; `n` is greater than 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 1 and it is now greater than `bottom`; the value at `screen[1][j]` is 'w'; if `i` is less than `top`, then `i` remains equal to 1.**
