The code snippet assigns new values to `min_x` and `min_y` based on the current values of `min_x`, `x`, `min_y`, and `y`. Specifically, `min_x` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`, while `min_y` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `y`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` contains at least 3 entries of tuples, `(x, y)` is the third tuple from `white_pixels`, `min_x` is now min(min_x, x), `min_y` is now min(min_y, y), `max_x` is now max(max_x, x), `max_y` is now max(max_y, y)**.
