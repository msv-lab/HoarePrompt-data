The value of `top` is assigned to `i`, which is currently 1. The states of the other variables (`bottom`, `left`, `right`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 1, `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1` (must be less than m).

Output State: **`top` is 1, `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1` (must be less than m)**
