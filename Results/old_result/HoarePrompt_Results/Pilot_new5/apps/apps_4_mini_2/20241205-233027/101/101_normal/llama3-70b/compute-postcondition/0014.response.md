The variable `frame_size` is assigned the value of the maximum difference between the x and y coordinates of the white pixels, plus one. The values of `max_x`, `min_x`, `max_y`, and `min_y` affect `frame_size`, but the values of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, and `white_pixels` remain unchanged. 

The calculation for `frame_size` is as follows:
- `max_x - min_x` gives the width of the white pixel rectangle.
- `max_y - min_y` gives the height of the white pixel rectangle.
- Taking the maximum of these two dimensions and adding one gives the required size of the frame.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` contains all tuples of coordinates for each pixel equal to 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all white pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all white pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all white pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all white pixels, and `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` contains all tuples of coordinates for each pixel equal to 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate among all white pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate among all white pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate among all white pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate among all white pixels, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.**
