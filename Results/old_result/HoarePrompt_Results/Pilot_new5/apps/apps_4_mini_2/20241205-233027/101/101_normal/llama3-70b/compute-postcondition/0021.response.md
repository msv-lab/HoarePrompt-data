The code updates the value at the `pixels` array at the coordinates specified by `i` and `j`. Specifically, `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. The initial state indicates that `pixels[i][j]` was previously a `'.'`, and since `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x` and `j` is either `min_y` or `max_y`, these values are valid.

After executing the code, the value of `pixels[i][j]` has changed, while the other variables remain unchanged, and the constraints on their values still apply.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `pixels[i][j]` is '+'**.
