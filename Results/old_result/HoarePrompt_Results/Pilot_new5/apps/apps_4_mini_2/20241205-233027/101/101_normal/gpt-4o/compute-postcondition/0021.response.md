Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left` remain 0, and if `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to 0, while `i` and `j` remain 0. If `top` is not None, `top` remains 0, `bottom` remains 0, `left` remains 0, and `right` is updated to the value of `j` if `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`, with no changes if `j` is not greater than `right`.***
