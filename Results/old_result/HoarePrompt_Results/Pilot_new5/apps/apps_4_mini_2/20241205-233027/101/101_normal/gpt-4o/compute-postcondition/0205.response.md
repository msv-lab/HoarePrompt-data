The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and `screen`, which is a list of strings of length `m` containing only characters 'w' and '.' with at least one character being 'w'. 

After executing the function body, the output can be categorized into three cases:
- Case 1: The function returns -1 if there is an undefined state indicated by the presence of None in the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`.
- Case 2: The function returns -1 if the current value of `frame_height` is less than 2 or the current value of `frame_width` is less than 2.
- Case 3: The function returns the modified `result`, which contains '+' at the border positions defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`, where originally there were '.'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `screen`, and return -1 under certain conditions or a modified result based on the defined borders. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m (both integers) and a list of strings screen. It returns -1 if there is an undefined state or if the frame dimensions are too small; otherwise, it returns a modified result containing '+' at specified border positions.**
