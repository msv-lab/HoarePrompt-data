The value at the position `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the character `'+'`. The specific values of `i` and `j` are given as 2. Since `m` must be greater than 2 but is not explicitly defined here, we will not be able to specify its value.

The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `pixels[i][j]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `pixels[2][2]` is assigned the value '+'**.
