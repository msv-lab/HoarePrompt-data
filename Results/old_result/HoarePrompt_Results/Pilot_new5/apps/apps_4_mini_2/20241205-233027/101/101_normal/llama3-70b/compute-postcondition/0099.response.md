The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by its definition. However, it processes input consisting of two integers, `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters, where each character represents a pixel that is either black ('.') or white ('w'). The function's output is not explicitly stated, but it likely analyzes these characters in some manner. 

Considering the provided constraints, we can summarize the functionality as follows: 

Functionality: **The function processes input consisting of two integers n and m, followed by n lines of m characters, where each character is either '.' or 'w'. It ensures there is at least one 'w' character in the input, suggesting it performs some analysis on the pixel data. The exact return value is unspecified in the given details.**
