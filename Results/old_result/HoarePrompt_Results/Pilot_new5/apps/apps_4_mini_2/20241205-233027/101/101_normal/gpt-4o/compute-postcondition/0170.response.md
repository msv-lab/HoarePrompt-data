Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `j` is `right`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`. If the current value of `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or the current value of `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then all positions `result[i][j]` for `j` in the range `left` to `right` that were originally '.' have been updated to '+'.**
