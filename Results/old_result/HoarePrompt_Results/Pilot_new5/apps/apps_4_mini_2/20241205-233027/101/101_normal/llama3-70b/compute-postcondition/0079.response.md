The statement `continue` is used within loops to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there are no variables being modified or returned as a result of this statement, the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
