Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. If the condition holds that `i` is equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[1][1]` is '+', the program continues. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w', it indicates that `pixels[1][1]` is '.', showing that it does not equal 'w'.***
