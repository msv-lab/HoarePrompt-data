Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` remains 0, `left` remains 0, and `i` remains 0. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `right` is updated to the value of `j` if `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`, while the other variables remain unchanged.***
