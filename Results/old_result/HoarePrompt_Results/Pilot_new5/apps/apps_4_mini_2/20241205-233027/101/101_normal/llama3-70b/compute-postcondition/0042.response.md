According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is the number of columns in pixels, `j` is equal to `m`, `pixels[i][j]` retains its state based on the conditions applied during the loop execution**
