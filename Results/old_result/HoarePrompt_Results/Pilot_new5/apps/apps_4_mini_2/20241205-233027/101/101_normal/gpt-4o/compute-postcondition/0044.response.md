The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`. Since the initial state indicates that `j` has a value of 2 and there are no conditions that change its value or the values of any other variables, the output state remains unchanged except for `right`. The states of the other variables remain valid as specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `right` is 2.
