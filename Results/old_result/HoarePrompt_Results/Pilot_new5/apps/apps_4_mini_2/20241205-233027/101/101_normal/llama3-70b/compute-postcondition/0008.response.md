The code assigns new values to `min_x` and `min_y` based on the minimum values between the current values of `min_x` and `x`, and the current values of `min_y` and `y`, respectively. The previous values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `x`, and `y` are used to perform this operation. The values of `max_x` and `max_y`, `n`, `m`, and `pixels` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` contains at least 2 entries of tuples, `(x, y)` is the second tuple from `white_pixels`, `min_x` is now min(min_x, x), `min_y` is now min(min_y, y), `max_x` is now max(max_x, x), `max_y` is now max(max_y, y)**.
