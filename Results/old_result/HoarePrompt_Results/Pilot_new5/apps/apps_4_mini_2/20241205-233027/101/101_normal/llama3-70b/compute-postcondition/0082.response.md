Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[2][1]` is '+', then `pixels[2][1]` remains '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[2][1]` is 'w', the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If neither condition is met, then `pixels[2][1]` is set to '.'***
