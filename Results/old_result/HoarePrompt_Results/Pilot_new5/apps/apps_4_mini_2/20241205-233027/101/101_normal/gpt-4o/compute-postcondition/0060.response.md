The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. The initial conditions state that `i` is less than `top`, `i` is greater than `bottom`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', so `bottom` will now be equal to `i`. The `bottom` variable changes, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is greater than 0, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `i`, `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `i` is less than `top`, `bottom` is equal to `i`.**
