To determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we analyze the provided information:

- The loop iterates over the variable `j` across a range defined by `m`.
- The minimum and maximum boundaries `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are established based on the presence of 'w' in the `screen`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, which falls within the established boundaries of `top` and `bottom`.

Since the loop iterates through the range defined by `m`, we need to consider what happens to `j` in the next iteration:

1. The variable `j` will increment by 1 in the next iteration.
2. We need to ensure that the loop can still execute, which means `j` must be less than `m`.

Assuming that `j` has not reached its maximum value yet, we update the state accordingly:

- The `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` boundaries may remain the same unless there are changes in the `screen` during the next iteration, but we will assume they do not change for this task.
- Update `j` to the next value in the range, which will be `j + 1`.

Now, if we denote the current value of `j` at the end of the last iteration as its value before incrementing, the new value for `j` will be `j + 1`.

Thus, the final modified state will reflect these considerations:

State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `left` is the minimum column index containing 'w', `right` is the maximum column index containing 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1` (must be less than m)**
