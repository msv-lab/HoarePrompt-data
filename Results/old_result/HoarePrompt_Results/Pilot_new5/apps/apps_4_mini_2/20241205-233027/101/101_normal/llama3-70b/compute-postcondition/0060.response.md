The value of `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the character `'+'`. The indices `i` and `j` are currently 1 and 2, respectively, so the change affects the `pixels` array at the position `[1][2]`. The other variables, `n`, `m`, and `j`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated output state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `pixels[1][2]` is '+'**
