To determine the output state after all iterations of the nested loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the final conditions and transformations applied to the `pixels` list, based on the given loop structure and the relationships among the involved variables.

The loop iterates over every pixel in the `pixels` list, modifying each pixel based on certain conditions related to the coordinates of white pixels and their content. The final state of the `pixels` list will depend on the original values of the pixels and the specific conditions checked during each iteration.

1. The variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` define the boundaries for modification in the first and last rows and the first and last columns of the `pixels`.
2. For each pixel in the `pixels` list:
   - If it lies on the defined borders (i.e., if its row index is `min_x` or `max_x`, or its column index is `min_y` or `max_y`) and the original pixel value is `'.'`, it will be changed to `'+'`.
   - If the original pixel value is `'w'`, it remains unchanged.
   - All other pixels that do not satisfy these conditions will revert to `'.'`.

Given these conditions, we can summarize the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` contains modified pixel values such that border pixels that were originally '.' are now '+', all 'w' pixels remain unchanged, and any other pixels are set to '.'; `white_pixels` contains all coordinates of 'w' pixels; `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are the defined borders based on 'w' pixels.**
