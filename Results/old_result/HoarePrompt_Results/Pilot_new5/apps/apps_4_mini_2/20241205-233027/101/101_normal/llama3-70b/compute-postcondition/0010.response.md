According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list contains more entries, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `white_pixels` contains at least 2 entries, and `(x, y)` is the second tuple from `white_pixels`. This means that the first iteration processed the first entry, and the second entry is currently being processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `white_pixels` list must contain at least 3 entries so that there is a next tuple to process. The current tuple being processed is the second one, so for the next iteration, `x` and `y` will correspond to the third tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `pixels` is a list containing `n` entries of input strings, `white_pixels` contains at least 3 entries of tuples, `(x, y)` is the third tuple from `white_pixels`, `min_x` is now min(min_x, x), `min_y` is now min(min_y, y), `max_x` is now max(max_x, x), `max_y` is now max(max_y, y)**
