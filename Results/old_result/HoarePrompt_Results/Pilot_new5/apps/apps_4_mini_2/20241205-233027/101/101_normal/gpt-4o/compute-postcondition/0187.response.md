According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `top` and `bottom`. The loop will execute for each value of `i` starting from `top` up to and including `bottom`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `top + 1`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must equal `top + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`. 

If `top` is the minimum row index containing 'w' and `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', for the loop to execute one more time, we require that `i` must be `top + 2` (which is `top + 1 + 1`). Thus, the condition must hold that `top + 2` is still less than or equal to `bottom`. 

State: **`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 2`, `j` is `right`**
