Postcondition: ***`top` is the minimum row index containing 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index containing 'w', `i` is `top + 1`, `j` is `left`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, and the current value of `i` is either equal to `top` or `bottom`. `j` is either equal to `left` or `right`. The value of `result[i][j]` is a period ('.').***
