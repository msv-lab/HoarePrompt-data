The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables or affect the program's state directly. It simply skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since `i` is equal to 2, `j` is equal to 0, and the condition has been satisfied that is not the case for the specified boundaries, all variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 2000, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
