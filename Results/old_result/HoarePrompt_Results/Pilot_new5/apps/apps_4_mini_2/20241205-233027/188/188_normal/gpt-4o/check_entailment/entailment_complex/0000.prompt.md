You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input

6

Output
NO

Input

10
20

Output
NO

3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer between 2 and 100, and the next n lines contain integers a_i where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if (len(unique_numbers) < 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2) :
            print('YES')
            print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` input integers; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the keys in `count` based on their frequency in `cards`, and the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more. If both the frequencies of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]` are equal to `n // 2`, the output is `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Otherwise, the output 'NO' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` input integers; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the keys in `count` based on their frequency in `cards`. If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or more and both frequencies of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]` are equal to `n // 2`, the output is `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. If not, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100) and then reads `n` integers from input (each between 1 and 100). It counts the frequency of each integer. If there are fewer than 2 unique integers, it prints 'NO'. If there are at least 2 unique integers, it checks if the two most common integers both appear exactly `n // 2` times. If so, it prints 'YES' followed by those two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If there are no integers or improper input is provided, the behavior is not explicitly defined in the code.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
