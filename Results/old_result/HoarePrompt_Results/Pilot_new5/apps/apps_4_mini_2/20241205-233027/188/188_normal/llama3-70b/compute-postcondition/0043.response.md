Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, and `d` is a dictionary containing at least one key (a unique integer from `a`). If `d[i]` equals `n // 2`, then if `c` is 0, `a1` is assigned the value of `i`, and `c` is increased by 1. If `c` is not 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
