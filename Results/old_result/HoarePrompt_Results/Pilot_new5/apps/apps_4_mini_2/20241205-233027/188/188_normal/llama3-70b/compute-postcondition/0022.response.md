The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the `i`-th index of the list `d`. The variable `i` is defined as the third element of the list `a`. Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list containing 100 integers, the state of the variable `d` is affected, specifically at index `i`.

The value of `i` is determined by the third element of list `a`, therefore, `i = a[2]`. The result of this assignment will be that `d[a[2]]` will now hold the value `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the third element of `a`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, and `d[i]` is now 1 (where `i` equals `a[2]`).**
