The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key (a unique integer from `a`), `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
