The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary containing at least one key (a unique integer from `a`), `c` is preserved (0 or not 0 depending on its value at the end of the last iteration), `a2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
