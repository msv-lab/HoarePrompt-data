`d[i]` is assigned the value `1`, which means that the key `i` is added to the dictionary `d` with a value of `1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, still being an even integer between 2 and 100, and `i` remains the first element of the list `a`. The state of `a` and the condition that `i` is not found in `d` before this operation is also still valid; after this operation, `i` will now be found in `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first element of `a`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d[i]` is 1, and `i` is now found in the collection `d`.**
