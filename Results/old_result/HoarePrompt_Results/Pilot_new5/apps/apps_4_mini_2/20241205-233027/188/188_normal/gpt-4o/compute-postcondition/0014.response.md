The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its signature. However, it relies on external input where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and the next `n` lines contain integers `a_i` such that each `a_i` is between 1 and 100. After executing the function body, the output is based on processing these input values. 

Since the function does not specify its return value in the provided output description, we are unable to discern the exact nature of the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function is based solely on the provided constraints regarding `n` and the list of integers `a_i`.

Functionality: **The function processes an even integer n (between 2 and 100) and the next n integers a_i (each between 1 and 100), but the specific output based on these inputs is not defined.**
