The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the next key in the dictionary `d`, which contains at least one key that is a unique integer from the list `a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary containing at least one key (a unique integer from `a`), and `a2` is assigned the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the next key in `d`, `a` is a list containing 100 integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary containing at least one key (a unique integer from `a`), `a2` is the value of `i`.**
