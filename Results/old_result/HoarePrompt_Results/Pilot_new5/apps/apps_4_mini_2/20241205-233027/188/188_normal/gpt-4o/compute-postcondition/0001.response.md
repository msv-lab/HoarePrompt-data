The variable `cards` is assigned a list comprehension that takes `n` inputs, converting each to an integer. Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, the value of `cards` will be a list containing `n` integer values based on user input. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and `cards` is a list of `n` input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` input integers.**
