The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`, which was previously defined as `mid - 1`. Therefore, `min_t` now holds the value equivalent to `mid - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of integers derived from `a`, `mid` is greater than 2, `i` is `mid - 1`, `cost` is the calculated sum of minimum differences, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `mid - 1`.**
