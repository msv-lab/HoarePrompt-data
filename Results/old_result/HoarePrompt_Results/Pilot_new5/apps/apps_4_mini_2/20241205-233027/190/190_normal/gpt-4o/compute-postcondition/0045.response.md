The variable `current_cost` is incremented by the value `t - 1 - length`. The value of `length` is defined as the next integer in the list `a`, and since `a` contains `n + 1` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 to 100, `length` will also be in the range 1 to 100. The value of `t` is not specified, so it remains as-is in the output state. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `length` is the next integer in the list `a`; `current_cost` is incremented by `t - 1 - length`.**
