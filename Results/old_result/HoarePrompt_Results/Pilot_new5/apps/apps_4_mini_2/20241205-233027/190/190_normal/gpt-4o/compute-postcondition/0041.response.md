The expression `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` updates the value of `current_cost` based on the previous values of `length` and `t`. The value of `current_cost` will increase by the difference of `length` and `t + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `current_cost`, while `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` remain as described.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `length` is the next integer in the list `a`; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`; `min_cost` is updated accordingly; `best_t` remains 1; and `t` is adjusted as per the loop logic.**
