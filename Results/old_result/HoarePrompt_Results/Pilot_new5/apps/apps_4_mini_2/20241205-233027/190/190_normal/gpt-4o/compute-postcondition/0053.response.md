Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost`, `best_t` is set to `t`, and `length` remains the last integer processed from list `a`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, and `length` continues to be the last integer processed from list `a`.***
